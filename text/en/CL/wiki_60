<text>Stephen John Hadley (born February 13, 1947) is an American attorney and senior government official who served as the 20th United States National Security Advisor from 2005 to 2009. He served under President George W. Bush during the second term of his administration. Hadley was Deputy National Security Advisor during Bush&#x27;s first term. 

== Early life and education ==
Hadley was born in Toledo, Ohio, the son of Suzanne (née Bentley), a homemaker, and Robert W. Hadley Jr., an electrical engineer. He grew up in South Euclid, Ohio, in the Cleveland metropolitan area. After reading the Allen Drury novel &quot;Advise and Consent&quot;, he became intrigued by the governing process and was elected student body president of Charles F. Brush High School. Hadley graduated from there as the valedictorian in 1965.

He received a B.A. degree in government from Cornell University in 1969, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, the Cornell University Glee Club, and the Quill and Dagger society. 

He then received a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Yale Law School in 1972 where he was the Note and Comment Editor of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. In law school, Hadley was a classmate of Hillary Clinton. He commissioned as an Ensign into the U.S. Navy through Yale Naval ROTC in 1972.

== Career ==

=== Military service ===
Hadley served as an officer in the United States Navy from 1972 to 1975. This included being an analyst for the Comptroller of the Department of Defense from 1972 to 1974.

=== Early government service ===
Hadley was a member of the National Security Council staff under President Gerald Ford from 1974 to 1977.

During this period, he worked for the law firm of Shea &amp; Gardner.

From 1986 to 1987, he served as counsel to the Special Review Board established by President Ronald Reagan to inquire into Iran–Contra affair.

During the administration of George H. W. Bush, Hadley was a Pentagon aide to Paul Wolfowitz, serving as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy from 1989 to 1993. In that position, he had responsibility for defense policy toward NATO and Western Europe, on nuclear weapons and ballistic missile defense, and arms control. He also participated in policy issues involving export control and the use of space. Hadley served as Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney&#x27;s representative in talks led by Secretary of State James Baker that resulted in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties, START I and START II.

=== Private sector work ===

During the years in which the Democratic Clinton administration was in power (1993–2001), Hadley was an administrative partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Shea &amp; Gardner, where he had worked earlier in his career. His professional legal practice focused on business problems of U.S. and foreign corporations particularly as they involve international business, regulatory, and strategy issues. These representations included export controls, foreign investment in U.S. national security companies, and the national security responsibilities of U.S. information technology companies.

He was also a principal in The Scowcroft Group, Inc., an international consulting firm. In this, he represented U.S. corporate clients seeking to invest and do business overseas.

=== George W. Bush administration ===
==== Campaign and transition ====
Hadley served as a senior foreign and defense policy adviser to Governor Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign and worked in the Bush-Cheney Transition on the National Security Council.

In January 2001, as George W. Bush prepared to take office, Hadley served on a panel for nuclear weapons issues sponsored by the National Institute for Public Policy, a neoconservative think tank. Other members of the panel included Stephen Cambone, William Schneider, and Robert Joseph. This panel advocated using tactical nuclear weapons as a standard part of the United States defense arsenal.

==== Deputy National Security Advisor ====

He was Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor from January 22, 2001. In 2002, Hadley was a member of the White House Iraq Group. On Sept. 9, 2002, Nicolò Pollari gave the forged &quot;Niger-Gate&quot; documents directly to Stephen Hadley. He admitted fault in allowing a disputed claim about Iraq&#x27;s quest for nuclear weapons material from Niger to be included in Bush&#x27;s January 28, 2003 State of the Union Address (see Niger uranium forgeries). On July 22, 2003, Hadley offered his resignation to Bush because he had &quot;failed in that responsibility&quot; and that &quot;the high standards the president set were not met.&quot; Bush denied Hadley&#x27;s request. Amid this, &quot;The Times&quot; of London reported that Hadley was Robert Novak&#x27;s source for Valerie Plame&#x27;s name in the CIA leak scandal, but this report proved to be false when Richard Armitage admitted that he was Novak&#x27;s source.

=== National Security Advisor ===
On January 26, 2005, he replaced Condoleezza Rice as National Security Advisor, upon Rice&#x27;s confirmation as Secretary of State. In that capacity he was the principal White House foreign policy advisor to President Bush, directed the National Security Council staff, and ran the interagency national security policy development and execution process.

Hadley played a significant role during the critical phase of the Iraq War, including the controversial 2007 &quot;surge&quot; strategy, which increased U.S. troop levels to combat rising insurgency and stabilize the country. He helped manage the transition from large-scale military operations to more focused counterinsurgency efforts. In 2007 Hadley led a public media campaign in an effort to convince the public that the proposed Iraq surge would work.

Hadley was known for avoiding focused public attention. In a 2006 profile, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Hadley as &quot;a modest man in an immodest job. In a town populated by people nursing grandiose views of their own importance and scheming for greater glory, Hadley still thinks of himself as a staff man. He sits at the pinnacle of power, but articulates no sweeping personal vision of the world and has made a point of staying in the shadows.&quot;

In his book &quot;&quot;, former president Jimmy Carter recounts that Hadley, in his capacity as national security adviser (Carter calls him by title rather than by name) personally denied Carter permission to visit Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in early 2005, in the wake of the administration&#x27;s decision to isolate the regime, due its &quot;differences with Syria concerning U.S. policy in Iraq&quot;.

He helped steer negotiations with North Korea through the Six-Party Talks, aiming to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.

=== Later career ===
Beginning in 2009, Hadley served as senior adviser for international affairs at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, DC. On January 24, 2014, he was elected chairman of the Board of Directors of the U.S. Institute of Peace. On September 11, 2018, USIP-based Task Force on Extremism in Fragile States, of which Hadley is a member, produced the report &quot;Beyond the Homeland: Protecting America from Extremism in Fragile States, &quot;which warns that the United States urgently needs a new approach to stem the spread of violent extremism and previews a comprehensive preventative strategy that focuses on strengthening resilience against extremism in fragile states.&quot; Hadley widely promoted the Interim Report in the media, including with United States Institute of Peace president Nancy Lindborg on the Foundation for Defense of Democracies&#x27; podcast &quot;Foreign Podicy&quot; hosted by Clifford May.

Hadley is a co-founder and principal, along with Condoleezza Rice, Robert Gates and Anja Manuel, in Rice, Hadley, Gates &amp; Manuel, a strategic consulting firm.

In 2013, Hadley was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

In March 2013, on the ten year anniversary, Hadley gave his views on what had gone wrong and what had been redeemed in terms of the Iraq War.

During the Syrian chemical weapons crisis in September 2013, Hadley appeared on Bloomberg Television, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and also wrote an op-ed piece for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he advocated attacking Syria with missiles. At the time, Hadley was a director at Raytheon and owned 11,477 shares of stock, but the news organizations failed to disclose the link and conflict of interest.
Hadley was initially floated as a potential option for Secretary of Defense in the first Trump administration. In this as well as for other positions, it was thought his process knowledge could be beneficial. Instead, in late 2016 he collaborated with Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on a plan for a new course in America&#x27;s approach to the Middle East.

Hadley is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He has been a member of the Defense Policy Board, the Foreign Affairs Policy Board, the National Security Advisory Panel to the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Board of Trustees of Analytical Services (&quot;ANSER&quot;).

Hadley is also an Executive Vice Chair on the Board of Directors at the Atlantic Council and is on the Board of Directors at defense contractor Raytheon.

On January 14, 2024, a U.S. delegation composed of Hadley and James Steinberg arrived in Taipei in the aftermath of Taiwan&#x27;s 2024 presidential election.

<text>Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet is a small parrot endemic to New Zealand, where it is known as the orange-fronted parakeet () or orange-fronted kākāriki. In the rest of the world it is called Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet, as when it was recognised as a species, the name &quot;orange-fronted parakeet&quot; was already used for &quot;Eupsittula canicularis&quot;, a Central American species. Restricted to a few valleys in the South Island and four offshore islands, its population declined to around 200 in the 1990s, and it is considered critically endangered by the IUCN.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot; is endemic to New Zealand and surrounding islands and it has been proposed that the ancestor of &quot;Cyanoramphus&quot; dispersed from New Caledonia to New Zealand via Norfolk Island 500,000 years ago.

Controversy has surrounded the classification of this bird; is it its own species or a colour morph of the similar yellow-crowned parakeet (&quot;C. auriceps&quot;)? It was described in 1857 from a museum specimen of unknown origin; its species name honours the French ornithologist Alfred Malherbe. During the late 1800s ornithologists considered it to be a distinct species, but during the latter half of the 20th century it was often considered a colour morph; as recently as 1990, the Ornithological Society of New Zealand listed it as a form of &quot;C. auriceps&quot;. After analysis using molecular genetic methods in 2000, the current consensus among researchers, which is accepted by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, is that &quot;Cyanoramphus malherbi&quot; is a distinct species.

== Description ==

Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet is a medium size parrot, approximately 20 centimetres long. Its body is primarily a bright blue-green, with azure blue primary covert and leading edge feathers on its wings.

It has a distinctive (and diagnostic) orange frontal band on its yellow crown, but this is absent in juvenile birds, which have fully green heads. The orange frontal band begins to develop when the bird is 2–5 weeks old. Its rump has orange patches on the sides. Colouration in males tends to be brighter, and juveniles are distinctly duller.

The only reliable features that separate mature orange-fronted parakeets from the similar yellow-crowned parakeet (&quot;C. auriceps&quot;) are the colour of the frontal band and rump.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is found in only three regions on New Zealand&#x27;s South Island: the South Branch Hurunui River valley, Hawdon River valley, and the Poulter valley. In addition, there are four translocated populations, found on Maud Island, Blumine Island, Chalky Island, and Mayor Island / Tuhua.

In the South Island, the parakeet is predominantly found only in &quot;Nothofagus&quot;/&quot;Fuscospora&quot; (beech) forest with some reports from alpine and subalpine tussock and open matagouri shrubland.

On Maud Island, one study found that the parakeet prefers areas with greater canopy cover and lower understory and ground cover. The species is not restricted to this type of forest, however, and as its population density increases it may make more use of other habitats.

== Behaviour ==
The parakeet is most often observed foraging, preening, and resting. They prefer the upper stratum of forests, but also frequent lower strata more often than &quot;C. auriceps&quot;.

=== Diet and feeding ===
The Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet typically feeds in the canopy of New Zealand beech trees, but will also forage in low vegetation and on the ground. They are typically observed feeding in flocks of mixed species, eating various seeds, beech flowers, buds and invertebrates.

During spring, invertebrates become a significant part of their diet, including leaf roller moth and fungus moth caterpillars, other Lepidoptera, and aphids. They have been observed feeding on herbs and ferns on the ground, including &quot;Pratia&quot;, &quot;Oreomyrrhis colensoi, Parahebe lyallii, Leptinella maniototo&quot; and &quot;Blechnum penna-marina&quot;. During mast years, beech seeds become the dominant feature of their diet.

The Maud Island population appears to have different dietary preferences to mainland populations, eating more plant species and fewer invertebrates.

=== Breeding ===
Malherbe&#x27;s parakeets are monogamous and able to nest year round, but peak breeding is between December and April. They primarily nest in natural hollows or cavities of mature beech trees, preferring red beech (&quot;Fuscospora fusca&quot;). On Maud Island they were found to nest in &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; forests.

Clutch size is around 7 eggs with an incubation period of 21–26 days. The female exclusively incubates and the male feeds her. Nestlings fledge between 43 and 71 days, but remain dependent for 2–4 weeks.

Their breeding is also linked to the production of beech seed during mast years. During seeding events, and other periods where food is plentiful, they are able to produce secondary clutches, with some pairs reportedly breeding up to four times in succession.

== Status ==
The Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet was classified as Nationally Endangered by the New Zealand Department of Conservation in 2012 and Critically Endangered by the IUCN.

In the 19th century the species was widespread, occurring throughout New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. The birds were semi-nomadic, dispersing in search of food when numbers were high. This behaviour has stopped due to low numbers and habitat modification, which also has implications for re-establishment of the species.

Prior to 2000, the parrot&#x27;s population numbered in the hundreds in the South Island, but fell from 500–700 individuals to an estimated 100–200 by 2004, due to significant increases in rat and stoat populations, in particular a rat plague during 2001.

The Hawdon River valley houses the largest population, with 70–200 individuals reported in 2013, but numbers are apparently decreasing. The Poulter valley population also declined in 2013, with approximately 40–80 individuals now occurring in this region. The South Branch Hurunui River valley population is even smaller, as few as 20–40 birds.

The world population of this species was estimated to be 290–690 individuals in 2013, with translocated island populations making up 160–420 of these birds. Determining exact numbers of the parakeet is difficult, however, due to their rarity, quiet nature, and similarities to &quot;C. auriceps&quot;.

=== Threats ===
The original decline in population was most likely due to habitat destruction and fragmentation by human activity, hunting, and predation from exotic species. Hunting has ceased and their habitat is protected, but habitat fragmentation may also continue to threaten the Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet.

Malherbe&#x27;s parakeets evolved in isolation from land mammals, so are especially vulnerable to introduced predators. Their current decline is due to predation from stoats (&quot;Mustela ermine&quot;), rats (&quot;Rattus&quot; spp.), and brushtail possums (&quot;Trichosurus vulpecula) &quot; which target eggs and nestlings. One population was reduced by 85% in 2001 due to predator irruption after a beech mast (a season of high production by southern beech). Deer and possums also contribute to the decline of Malherbe&#x27;s parakeets through forest destruction.

Competition for food may also be a factor. Introduced birds, mice, wasps, and rats are considerably reducing invertebrate numbers, which the parakeet relies on during winter and spring. The parakeet is however a food generalist and may compensate with other food sources, as observed on Maud Island. This dietary flexibility is promising for species recovery.

Inbreeding depression and low genetic diversity may affect the viability of these small populations by reducing their capacity to adapt to threats and diseases.

The specialised nesting habitat of the orange-fronted parakeet increases its vulnerability to extinction. The reasons for this include: (1) a single nest opening means that incubating females may be unable to escape from invading predators and will also be killed, (2) because only females incubate, predation may cause a biased sex ratio, (3) their relatively long nesting period (when compared to other passerines) increases their vulnerability to predation, and (4) the chicks tend to be noisy and therefore more attractive to predators. Furthermore, in beech silviculture the trees are not given enough time to develop adequate hollows before they are harvested, thereby reducing the number of suitable nesting sites in managed beech forests. Introduced starlings may also be outcompeting the parrot for nesting sites.

=== Conservation ===
Malherbe&#x27;s parakeet is absolutely protected under New Zealand&#x27;s Wildlife Act 1953. The species is also listed under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meaning international export/import (including parts and derivatives) is regulated.

Predator management is the main strategy to reverse this species&#x27; decline. All three mainland populations come under the &quot;Operation Ark&quot; initiative, which controls stoat, possum and rat populations through integrated pest management, with particular focus on reducing the effect of predator plagues. These pest management strategies have worked with other New Zealand bird species to reduce predation by introduced mammals.

Individual nest sites are also protected from predators using metal tree-trunk wraps; this has been a successful programme and only one nest out of 153 has been lost to predators since 2003.

The other major conservation strategy is captive breeding programmes carried out at Peacock Springs by the Isaac Wildlife Trust, with individuals being released on predator-free islands. Birds are placed in portable aviaries in the forest to acclimatise them before release.

A total of 45 birds were released between 2005 and 2007 on Chalky Island, off the coast of Fiordland. The local population had increased to 150 individuals in 2009, and 100–200 by 2011, but had declined to 50–150 individuals in 2013.

Sixty-eight individuals were released on Maud Island in the Marlborough Sounds between 2007 and 2009, but 2013 the island&#x27;s population consisted of only 10–20 birds.

Malherbe&#x27;s parakeets have also been translocated to Mayor Island / Tuhua in the Bay of Plenty and Blumine Island in the Marlborough Sounds; estimated population in 2013 were 50–150 and 50–100 birds respectively. These two populations, however, are not as well studied as those on Chalky Island and Maud Island.

A population of Malherbe&#x27;s parakeets has been established at the Brook Waimārama Sanctuary near Nelson through seven translocations (to March 2023) totalling 125 birds from several of the other populations.

<doc id="1175417" wikidata="Q258991" url="?curid=1175417" title="Zohar Argov">
<text>Zohar Orkabi (; July 16, 1955 – November 6, 1987), known professionally as Zohar Argov (), was an Israeli singer. A distinctive voice in the Mizrahi music scene, Argov is widely known in Israel as &quot;The king of Mizrahi music&quot;. However, he remains a divisive figure in Israeli culture due to his controversial rape conviction and charges.

== Biography ==
Zohar Argov was born in Rishon LeZion, Israel, to Ovadia and Yona Orkabi, Jewish parents who immigrated from Yemen. He was the eldest of ten children. He displayed a talent for singing in childhood, and his classmates nicknamed him &quot;nightingale&quot;. All his siblings also displayed an interest in music. As a result of Argov&#x27;s disinterest in any aspect of school except music, which was exacerbated by his family&#x27;s financial problems, he dropped out of school at age 14 to work at a construction company. In 1972, he married a neighbour, Bracha Tzabari, and a year later, she gave birth to their son Gili. Argov&#x27;s father Ovadia, with whom he had had a stormy relationship over the latter&#x27;s authoritarianism and alcoholism, died on the day of Gili&#x27;s brit. Gili would later follow in his footsteps and become a singer as well. Due to his family situation, he was exempted from mandatory military service in the Israel Defense Forces.

==Music career==
In 1977, at age 22, Argov published a single with two songs written and composed by Moshe Nagar. When releasing this single, in consultation with his wife Bracha, he changed his last name from Orkabi to Argov. He felt that the name Orkabi would not &quot;sound good&quot; to the media and establishment, and chose the name of one of the greatest composers and musicians in Israel at the time, Sasha Argov. The single was unsuccessful, airing only once on a radio broadcast featuring &quot;musical oddities&quot;. Nonetheless, he began working as a singer full-time, giving live performances. His pay was meager, and within months, he had incurred huge debts, all of his property was repossessed, and he could no longer support his wife and son. The family&#x27;s poor financial status and the pressure of late-night club appearances put a strain on his marriage, which ended with Bracha moving back in with her parents and taking Gili with her.

In 1978, Argov was arrested for rape after he had offered a woman a ride home from a Bar Mitzvah performance, then forced her into his apartment and sexually assaulted her. His trial was presided over by judge Dov Levin, who would later serve as a judge on the Supreme Court of Israel. During his trial, when it was still not clear to the court whether the incident had constituted rape or consensual relations, Argov commented &quot;there is no girl who doesn&#x27;t want it, she just needs to learn how to take it.&quot; He was convicted of rape as a result of this comment and sentenced to three years in prison. His wife filed for divorce during this time.

Argov was released in 1979, after which he returned to his work as a musician. At first, he joined a band which appeared at clubs and family events. During an event in Beersheba with Jacky Mekaiten, another well known Mizrahi singer, Argov asked to sing and Jacky and the band members agreed. He then performed two songs live.

Argov&#x27;s debut album &quot;Elinor&quot; (1980) featured the title track, &quot;Sod HaMazalot&quot; (&quot;The Zodiac Secret&quot;), and &quot;Mah Lakh, Yaldah?&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s With You, Girl?&quot;), a tribute to his ex-wife, Bracha, who remained the love of his life. With the success of the album, Argov became a popular singer, and performed live throughout Israel. He was among the first singers to achieve commercial and nationwide success in the sphere of Middle Eastern-Mediterranean/Oriental (Mizrahi)-style music, despite the fact that his music was not mainstream at the time and radio stations gave predominance to pop music from overseas.

In 1982, Argov participated in the Mizrahi Music Festival with the song “HaPerah BeGani” (הפרח בגני, The Flower in my garden), the song would ultimately win the festival’s competition and became Argov’s and subsequently Mizrahi music’s mainstream breakthrough. Ironically, Argov disliked the song and wanted to perform “Shir Prati” (שיר פרטי, Private Song) at the festival.

Afterwards, Argov toured the United States, and was invited to parties and clubs. It was there that he was first exposed to hard drugs and began to develop his heroin and crack cocaine addiction. He claimed that he was first introduced to hard drugs at Club Halleluyah in Los Angeles. From 1983, his drug addiction began to affect his functioning. By the end of the year, his drug abuse coupled with his demanding performance schedule was beginning to visibly affect his health. In late 1983, three associates took him to Eilat and locked him in a hotel room to dry out. However, this was unsuccessful.

Although he was still able to sing in live performances under the influence of drugs, his drug abuse caused him to miss performances and recording sessions. By this time Argov was a wealthy man, but was spending his fortune on drugs. After deciding that he could not overcome his drug addiction, the Reuveni brothers ended their contract with him and chose to sign a contract with a promising new star, Haim Moshe, instead. Argov was stung by what he viewed as their betrayal, as well as the realization that there was no hope of reconciling with his ex-wife Bracha after she remarried at around this time. After his break with the Reuveni brothers, Avigdor Ben-Mosh became his producer. Although he continued recording music, he displayed dysfunctional behavior during recording sessions.

In 1984, Argov toured the United States and France. On July 16, 1984, after returning to Israel from a performance in Paris, Argov was arrested for drug dealing. He was released on bail two week later but prohibited from leaving the country for the next six months. By this time, his drug addiction was ruining his career and draining his wealth. Promoters began to take advantage of him by underpaying or pretending to pay him. In 1985, he released another album. In February of that year, during a Paris tour, he nearly overdosed on drugs. In June 1985, he was arrested for possession of heroin and received a one year suspended sentence.

In late 1985, he signed a 15-year contract with Jerusalem producer Nissim Ben-Haim. He released his seventh album in 1986. It was a commercial success, but Argov performed rarely that year, until he had himself committed to a drug abuse rehabilitation program. Upon completing the program in 1987, he appeared on a talk show and declared he was clean and ready to start a new chapter in his life. Two months later, he lapsed back into drug abuse. In April 1987, A record label against Argov’s wishes released his eighth and final album. Argov had tried to prevent the album’s release via legal action but failed.

==Death==

In the early morning hours of July 23, 1987, Argov, his brother, and another man entered the Magen David Adom station in Rishon LeZion and demanded drugs. Shortly afterward, Argov was arrested on suspicion of stealing the purse of a doctor in the area, but was released after it was determined he had nothing to do with the theft. During his release from the police station, Argov stole a pistol that was lying on a desk. After an extensive manhunt, he was arrested with the pistol in his possession, convicted, and sentenced to one month in prison, which was extended to six months upon appeal.

Three weeks before he was due to be released, Argov was granted a furlough to allow him to go home. He initially stayed in the home of singer Yishai Levi in Holon before he and Levi&#x27;s girlfriend and future wife, Iris Gabbay, stayed alone at Argov&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in Rishon LeZion. Afterwards, Gabbay filed a police complaint claiming that Argov had attempted to rape her. Upon returning to prison, Argov was arrested and taken to a police station in Rishon LeZion for interrogation.

On November 6, 1987, Argov died in his cell in an apparent suicide by hanging. He was 32. He was found dead at 4:00 AM, hanging from strips torn from a blanket wrapped around his neck. Chief Superintendent Aharon Tal, who was appointed to investigate Argov&#x27;s death, concluded that Argov had not intentionally committed suicide, but rather wanted to make it appear as if he was attempting suicide to get concessions from the guards. He had died after the strips had tightened around his neck and he was unable to save himself due to the effects of drugs he had taken.

== Legacy ==
After his death Argov continued to retain his status as &quot;HaMelekh&quot; (the King) of Mizrahi music. From 1990, three years after his death, the Israel Broadcasting Authority organized a series of annual memorial concerts at Binyanei HaUma convention center in Jerusalem and a fundraising campaign was launched to establish a drug rehabilitation center named after him. He is credited with introducing Mizrahi music into the Israeli mainstream, and his life story has been widely discussed, with some considering it emblematic of the sociocultural tragedy that befalls singers from the Mizrahi community in Israel.

A mainstream label, Hed Arzi, released a double album of his music, &quot;Zohar Argov: The Best.&quot; Argov was the subject of a play mounted at the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv, and a feature film on his life, &quot;Zohar (1993),&quot; enjoyed commercial success.

His songs, among them &quot;HaPerakh BeGani&quot; (&quot;The Flower in My Garden&quot;), &quot;Mah Lakh, Yaldah?&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s With You, Girl&quot;), &quot;Ba&#x27;avar Hayu Zmanim&quot; (&quot;In The Past There Were Times&quot;), &quot;Nakhon Lehayom&quot; (As Of Today) and &quot;Badad&quot; (&quot;Alone&quot;), are now Israeli pop classics and an integral part of national culture. Proposals to name streets after him in Rishon Lezion and Tel Aviv were discussed in 2007 but sparked a controversy due to his conviction on rape charges, for which he spent a year in prison. When he committed suicide in 1987, he was in a jail cell after again being charged with rape.

Argov also is said to have the best selling albums in Israel, however these claims have never been verified. (For example, his debut “Eleanor” is claimed to have sold 500,000 copies but no known reputable source exists to confirm this).

Eyal Golan released a covers/tribute album of Argov’s best known songs in 2018 named “Nakhon LeTamid” (As of Forever).

In 2023, &quot;Kan Le Olam&quot; (&quot;Here Forever&quot;), a duet with Ofra Haza was released in conjunction with Israel&#x27;s 75th birthday. It was created using artificial intelligence and the families of Argov and Haza consented to its use.

<doc id="1175430" wikidata="Q8028657" url="?curid=1175430" title="Witzend">
<text>witzend, published on an irregular schedule spanning decades, is an underground comic showcasing contributions by comic book professionals, leading illustrators and new artists. &quot;witzend&quot; was launched in 1966 by the writer-artist Wally Wood, who handed the reins to Bill Pearson (Wonderful Publishing Company) from 1968 to 1985. The title was printed in lower-case.

==Origin==
When the illustrator Dan Adkins began working at the Wood Studio in 1965, he showed Wood pages he had been creating for his planned comics-oriented publication, &quot;Outlet&quot;. This inspired Wood to become an editor-publisher, and he began assembling art and stories for a magazine he titled &quot;et cetera&quot;. A front cover paste-up with the &quot;et cetera&quot; logo was prepared and even used in advance solicitation print ads, but when Wood learned of another magazine with a similar title, there was a last-minute title change.

==Wally Wood era==
Wood launched &quot;witzend&quot; in the summer of 1966, with a statement of &quot;no policy&quot; and a desire to give his friends in the comics field a creative detour from the formulaic industry mainstream. During this same period, editor Bill Spicer and critic Richard Kyle began promoting and popularizing the terms &quot;graphic novel&quot; and &quot;graphic story&quot;, and in 1967 Spicer changed the title of his &quot;Fantasy Illustrated&quot; to &quot;Graphic Story Magazine&quot;. Kyle, Spicer, Wood and Pearson all envisioned an explosion of graphic narratives far afield of the commercial comic book industry.
Advertisements described &quot;witzend&quot; as &quot;intended for fans and collectors of science fiction, comics, satire, S+S and related fields&quot; with &quot;the work of the world&#x27;s best cartoonists and illustrators&quot;, mentioning Al Williamson, Jack Gaughan, Frank Frazetta, and Reed Crandall. The magazine&#x27;s first issue had Wood&#x27;s &quot;Animan&quot; and &quot;Bucky Ruckus&quot;, and Williamson&#x27;s science fiction adventure &quot;Savage World&quot;. Crandall illustrated Edgar Rice Burroughs, along with pages by Steve Ditko, Gaughan, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Ralph Reese, Roy G. Krenkel and Angelo Torres. The issue finished with Frazetta&#x27;s back cover portrait of Buster Crabbe.

The second issue displayed a front cover by Wood and a back cover by Reese. Gray Morrow&#x27;s &quot;Orion&quot;, which began in this issue of &quot;witzend&quot;, was completed in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; in 1979. Two pages of &quot;Hey, Look!&quot; by Harvey Kurtzman were followed by &quot;a feeble fable&quot; from Warren Sattler, &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Join &#x27;em... Beat &#x27;em&quot; and more ERB illustrations by Crandall and Frazetta. The center spread presented poems by Wood, Reese and Pearson. Following a Bill Elder cartoon, &quot;Midnight Special&quot; by Ditko and &quot;By the Fountain in the Park&quot; by Don Martin, Wood offered another &quot;Animan&quot; installment.

In the third issue, between a Wood front cover and a Williamson back cover, were Ditko&#x27;s first &quot;Mr. A&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot; by Richard Bassford, Wood&#x27;s &quot;Pipsqueak Papers&quot;, more &quot;Hey, Look!&quot; pages and &quot;Last Chance&quot;, a previously unpublished 1950s EC New Direction story, drawn by Frazetta and rewritten and edited by Bill Pearson. The issue also featured work by Roger Brand, Will Eisner, Richard &quot;Grass&quot; Green and Art Spiegelman.

With &quot;witzend&quot; number four, Wood began a serialization of his epic fantasy, &quot;The World of the Wizard King&quot;. These installments of illustrated prose fiction were co-authored with Pearson. Shifting from illustrated text to a comics format, Wood continued the storyline in his later graphic novel, published in two editions (one b/w, one color)—&quot;The Wizard King&quot; (1978) and &quot;The King of the World&quot; (Éditions du Triton, 1978).

==Bill Pearson era==
After the fourth issue, Wood sold &quot;witzend&quot; to Pearson&#x27;s Wonderful Publishing Company &quot;for the sum of $1.00&quot;. Wood remained listed as founder and Editor Emeritus. After editing and publishing #5 (1968) by himself, Pearson co-published the next five issues with various other individuals/entities: #6 with Ed Glaser, #s 7, 8, and 9 with Phil Seuling (founder of the New York Comic Art Convention in 1968), and #10 with the CPL Gang, a group of artists and writers who were publishing other fanzines such as &quot;Charlton Bullseye&quot;, and &quot;CPL&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Pictorial Literature&quot;); from #11 on, Pearson was sole publisher and editor. These post-Wood issues edited by Pearson continued to explore new avenues with contributions from Vaughn Bode, Eisner, Jeff Jones, Wood, Bernie Wrightson, Kenneth Smith, Alex Toth, Roy G. Krenkel, Mike Hinge and many others. Pearson also assembled two theme issues: the final issue #13 (1985) was titled &quot;Good Girls&quot;—without the &quot;witzend&quot; logo on the front cover—containing diverse drawings of women, and #9 (1973) was a non-comics issue profiling W. C. Fields, due to then co-publisher Seuling&#x27;s extreme interest in the actor and his film works. In 1989–90, he also published two digest-sized issues of &quot;Witzend Catalog&quot;, that were only partly editorial content, including unpublished Krenkel art, the other part being original art pieces for sale.

==Reception==

A critical survey of the magazine, &quot;Wood at His witzend&quot; by Rick Spanier, appears in Bhob Stewart&#x27;s biographical anthology, &quot;Against the Grain: Mad Artist Wallace Wood&quot; (TwoMorrows, 2003). Designer-typographer Spanier once edited a similar graphic story publication, &quot;Picture Story Magazine&quot;, requested by the Museum of Modern Art for its collection. After analyzing all 13 issues of &quot;witzend&quot; and fitting it into the context of alternative publishing of the period, Spanier concluded that &quot;witzend&quot;&#x27;s &quot;salient point, that comic artists were entitled to more control and ownership of their own work, would eventually be recognized by the publishers of comic books, but it is hard to argue that &quot;witzend&quot; itself was a key factor in that development. Like so many other visionary endeavors, it may simply have been ahead of its time&quot;.

<text>Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps is a British television sitcom that ran from 26 February 2001 to 24 May 2011. First broadcast on BBC Two, it originally starred Sheridan Smith, Will Mellor, Natalie Casey, Ralf Little, Kathryn Drysdale, Beverley Callard. The show was created and written by Susan Nickson and set in her hometown of Runcorn, Cheshire, it originally revolved around the lives of five twentysomethings. Little departed after the sixth series, and Smith and Drysdale left after the eighth series. The ninth and final series had major changes with new main cast members and new writers.

The core cast was augmented by various recurring characters throughout the series, portrayed by Beverley Callard, Lee Oakes, Hayley Bishop, Thomas Nelstrop, Freddie Hogan and Georgia Henshaw. The title was inspired by the 1980 song &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please&quot; by punk rock band Splodgenessabounds. On 23 July 2011, it was confirmed that the series would not return due to the BBC making room for new comedies and feeling that the series had come to a natural end after the departures of most of the main cast members.

==Production==
BBC Two announced the first series as one of the highlights of their Autumn 2000 schedule, although the premiere was eventually held back to 2001. The first six series with the original cast including Ralf Little ran until 2006, with Jonny killed off-screen during the first episode of the seventh series.

An eighth series was confirmed by Mellor in an interview in the &quot;Metro&quot; on 21 April 2008, in which he said that they would be filming the series from November 2008 to January 2009. In January 2009, the BBC announced recording dates for the next series at BBC Television Centre from 1 February to 3 April. Natalie Casey, Kathryn Drysdale, Luke Gell, Will Mellor and Sheridan Smith all returned and the new character of Wesley was played by Thomas Nelstrop.

The outcome of the final episode of series 8 was decided by the public, who were asked to vote on whether Gaz should be with Donna or Janet. Following the finale of series 8, which was broadcast on 10 May 2009, the audience chose Donna with 76.9% of the vote. The final episode concluded with Donna at Gaz&#x27;s bedside.

Two special episodes of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps were filmed in 2009. The first was set a few minutes after the ending of the previous episode, its cast being limited to Janet, Wesley and Tim, and was recorded on 13 August 2009 at BBC TV Centre. It was a musical extravaganza set entirely inside the Archer and was broadcast on 15 December 2009. The second, &quot;Sliding Gaz&quot;, was recorded on 18 August 2009 and shown on 22 December 2009. The cast consists of Donna and Gaz only and shows Donna in a &quot;sliding doors&quot; technique, imagining Gaz being healthy and also paralysed.

In April 2010, it was revealed that the show was to return, albeit &#x27;refreshed&#x27; by the BBC, after the departure of the creator of the show, Susan Nickson. Original cast members Sheridan Smith and Kathryn Drysdale were written out of the series after deciding not to return for series 9, and their departures were mentioned in the first episode of series 9. On 25 July 2011 the BBC decided that the show would not return for a tenth series.

<text>The Cumberland Valley is a northern constituent valley of the Great Appalachian Valley, within the Atlantic Seaboard watershed in Pennsylvania and Maryland. The Appalachian Trail crosses through the valley.

==Geography==
The valley is bound to the west and north by the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians (Bear Pond Mountains/Blue Mountain), to the east and south by South Mountain, to the northeast by the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, and to the south by the Potomac River. The portion of the valley residing in Maryland is sometimes referred to as the Hagerstown Valley.

The Cumberland Valley Railroad, the Cumberland Valley AVA wine region, and the Cumberland Valley School District are named for the region.

==Settlements==
Cities in the Cumberland Valley include Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Hagerstown, Maryland. Pennsylvania boroughs include Camp Hill, Mechanicsburg, Carlisle, Shippensburg, Chambersburg, Waynesboro, and Greencastle.

<doc id="1175449" wikidata="Q7655569" url="?curid=1175449" title="Sweet Violets">
<text>&quot;Sweet Violets&quot; is an American song that contains classic example of a &quot;censored rhyme&quot;, where the expected rhyme of each couplet is replaced with a surprising word which segues into the next couplet or chorus. For example, the first couplets go:

There once was a farmer who took a young miss
In back of the barn where he gave her a...
Lecture on horses and chickens and eggs
And told her that she had such beautiful...
Manners that suited a girl &quot;[etc.]&quot;
The chorus is taken nearly verbatim from the song &quot;Sweet Violets&quot; by Joseph Emmet, from his 1882 play &quot;Fritz Among the Gypsies&quot;:

Sweet violets, sweeter than the roses
Covered all over from head to toe
Covered all over with sweet violets.
The song was recorded by Dinah Shore with Henri René&#x27;s Orchestra &amp; Chorus in Hollywood on May 20, 1951. The song was released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 20-4174A (78 rpm record), 47-4174A (single) (in USA), by EMI on the His Master&#x27;s Voice label as catalog number B 10115 in the UK, and EA 3997 in Australia, also on the His Master&#x27;s Voice label. The Dinah Shore version was arranged by Cy Coben and Charles Grean. It reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart.

It has also been recorded by Mitch Miller and the Gang, Jane Turzy, and Judy Lynn.

The song (in all its versions, combined) reached number one on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; best-seller chart.

Numerous folk versions exist in which the implied lyrics are more risqué. A German Cover version exists by Rudi Carell (Goethe war gut).

<doc id="1175453" wikidata="Q3506745" url="?curid=1175453" title="Gavialis">
<text>Gavialis is a genus of crocodylians that includes the living gharial &quot;Gavialis gangeticus&quot; and one known extinct species, &quot;Gavialis bengawanicus.&quot; &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; comes from the Indian Subcontinent, while &quot;G. bengawanicus&quot; is known from Java. &quot;Gavialis&quot; likely first appeared in the Indian Subcontinent in the Pliocene and dispersed into the Malay Archipelago through a path called the Siva–Malayan route in the Quaternary. Remains attributed to &quot;Gavialis&quot; have also been found on Sulawesi and Woodlark Island east of the Wallace Line, suggesting a prehistoric lineage of &quot;Gavialis&quot; was able to traverse marine environments and reach places possibly as far as western Oceania.

The genus &quot;Gavialis&quot; was reevaluated in 2018 based on specimens in the Natural History Museum, London that were collected in the Sivalik Hills. The author concluded that &quot;G. gangeticus&quot; and &quot;G. bengawanicus&quot; are the only two species in the genus &quot;Gavialis&quot;, with &quot;G. hysudricus&quot; as a junior synonym of &quot;G. gangeticus.&quot; &quot;Rhamphosuchus&quot; is proposed to include &quot;G. leptodus&quot;, &quot;G. pachyrhynchus&quot;, &quot;G. curvirostris&quot; and &quot;G. breviceps&quot;. The species &quot;G. browni&quot; and &quot;G. lewisi&quot; require further revisions. &quot;G. dixoni&quot; has been assigned its own genus, &quot;Dollosuchus.&quot;

The below cladogram of the major extant crocodile groups is based on the latest molecular studies, and shows the gharial&#x27;s close relationship to the false gharial, and how the gavialids and crocodiles are more closely related than the alligatoroids:
Here is a more detailed cladogram that shows &quot;Gavialis&#x27;s&quot; proposed placement within Gavialidae, including extinct members:

<text>HMS &quot;Eskimo&quot; was a destroyer, &quot;Eskimo&quot; served throughout the Second World War, seeing action in Norway, the Mediterranean, the English Channel and in Burma. After the war &quot;Eskimo&quot; was used as an accommodation and headquarters ship, finally being used as a practice target before being scrapped in 1949.

==Description==
The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Eskimo&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships; Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

===Wartime modifications===
Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals&#x27; anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace &#x27;X&#x27; mount with a pair of QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later. To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.

== Construction and career ==
Authorized as one of nine Tribal-class destroyers under the 1936 Naval Estimates, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was the second ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 19 June 1936 from Vickers-Armstrong and was laid down on 5 August at the company&#x27;s High Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, shipyard. Launched on 3 September 1937, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was commissioned on 30 December 1938 at a cost of £342,108 which excluded weapons and communications outfits furnished by the Admiralty.
&quot;Eskimo&quot; participated in the Second Battle of Narvik in April 1940. On 12 April, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was hit by a torpedo fired from German destroyer . The explosion caused severe damage, blowing off &quot;Eskimo&quot;&#x27;s bow. After temporary repairs by the shipwrights of the fleet repair ship &quot;Vindictive&quot; at Skjelfjorden in Norway, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was able to return to the Vickers-Armstrong works at Newcastle for rebuilding, which took until Sept. 1940.

She supported the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942 and served with the 10th Destroyer Flotilla at Plymouth. &quot;Eskimo&quot; was extensively damaged when two German dive bombers attacked her in the Mediterranean while taking part in Operation Husky. She cornered and sank the enemy German submarine while in company with the Canadian destroyer and a Liberator aircraft of the No. 311 Squadron RAF in the English Channel north of Brest on 24 June 1944. On 13 July 1944, &quot;Eskimo&quot; and engaged the vorpostenboote V 203 &quot;Carl Röver&quot;, V 213 &quot;Claus Bolten&quot; and the minesweeper in the English Channel. Although V 213 &quot;Claus Bolten&quot; and &quot;M 4611&quot; were sunk and V 203 &quot;Carl Röver&quot; was severely damaged, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was herself severely damaged by gunfire from V 203 &quot;Carl Röver&quot;. During the final days of the war, she operated in the Far East.

==Fate==
&quot;Eskimo&quot; was reduced to an accommodation and headquarters ship for minesweepers, wreck-disposal vessels, and salvage craft clearing the Thames and Medway estuaries in 1946. She was used as a target ship in the Gareloch, sold for scrap on 27 June 1949 and finally broken up at Troon.

===Museum holdings===
&quot;Eskimo&quot;&#x27;s bell is in the collection of the National Maritime Museum. Imperial War Museums holds a range of material relating to &quot;Eskimo&quot;, including photographs, film, and an officially commissioned watercolour by Vivian Pitchforth showing &quot;Eskimo&quot; refitting at Durban. The National Museum of the Royal Navy holds a detailed ship model of &quot;Eskimo&quot;, built by Commander John West. West had served in &quot;Eskimo&quot; as navigating officer at Narvik.

Her Pennant and Crest are on display at St Clares Church in Newton Aycliffe, Co Durham

In addition to its commitment to technological advancements, Emerson has prioritized sustainability and corporate social responsibility. The company is actively pursuing goals related to energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and community development, making strides toward carbon neutrality in its operations.
==History==
Emerson was established 1890 in St. Louis, Missouri, as Emerson Electric Manufacturing Co. by Civil War Union veteran John Wesley Emerson to manufacture electric motors using a patent owned by the Scottish-born brothers Charles and Alexander Meston. In 1892, it became the first to sell electric fans in the United States. It quickly expanded its product line to include electric sewing machines, electric dental drills, and power tools.

During World War II, under the leadership of Stuart Symington, Emerson became the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of airplane armament. Emerson ranked 52nd among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

In 1954, W.R. &quot;Buck&quot; Persons was named company president. Under his leadership, Emerson diversified its business by acquiring 36 companies. When he retired in 1973, the company had 82 plants, 31,000 employees, and $800 million in sales.

In 1962, it acquired the United States Electrical Manufacturing Company as the U.S. Electrical Motors Division, including the brand U.S. Motors. In 1968, it acquired the InSinkErator company.

Charles F. Knight was CEO from 1973 to 2000, and was chairman from 1974 to 2004. His tenure marked the development of a rigorous planning process, new product and technology development, acquisitions and joint ventures, and international growth. David Farr succeeded him as chairman, and was also the CEO until 2021.

On December 15, 1999, Emerson Electric reached an agreement to acquire Jordan Industries Inc.&#x27;s telecommunications equipment division for a total of $440 million, a strategic move aimed at strengthening its position in the rapidly growing telecommunications sector at the time.

In 2010, Emerson sold its U.S. Motors brand to Nidec Corporation, marking a significant shift in Emerson’s focus towards more advanced technology-driven industries.

On July 26, 2011, Emerson publicly announced its decision to establish its Latin American regional headquarters in Sunrise, Florida, as part of its strategy to expand its footprint in the region and better serve its growing customer base in Latin America.

On December 1, 2016, Platinum Equity acquired Emerson’s Network Power division for more than $4 billion, rebranding the business as Vertiv. This acquisition encompassed several well-known brands, including ASCO, Chloride, Liebert, NetSure, and Trellis, significantly enhancing Platinum Equity’s portfolio in the critical infrastructure technology sector.

In July 2018, Emerson completed the acquisition of Textron Tools and Test Businesses for a total of $810 million, which included brands such as Greenlee, Klauke, HD Electric, and Sherman + Reilly. This acquisition further expanded Emerson’s offerings in the professional tools and test equipment market, adding valuable assets to its business.

On April 1, 2020, Emerson strengthened its presence in the hydropower control systems industry by acquiring the American Governor Company, a provider of technologies used to control hydroelectric turbines. This acquisition was aimed at boosting Emerson’s capabilities in renewable energy sectors.

In October 2022, Emerson reached a significant deal to sell a 55 percent controlling interest in its climate technologies business to private equity firm Blackstone Inc. for $14 billion, including debt. This sale represented a decision by Emerson to pivot towards higher-growth areas such as automation, while also benefiting from Blackstone’s expertise in scaling businesses.

Following a nearly year-long negotiation, in April 2023, Emerson finalized an agreement to acquire National Instruments in an all-cash transaction valued at $8.2 billion. This acquisition was designed to enhance Emerson’s automation technology capabilities, adding advanced testing and measurement technologies to its product portfolio and enabling further innovation in its industrial automation business.

==Corporate==
Emerson has undergone significant leadership transitions and strategic shifts since its founding in 1890. Key leadership in the mid-20th century includes W.R. Persons, who focused on diversification and expansion from 1954 to 1973, followed by Charles Knight, under whom Emerson pursued aggressive acquisitions and global growth between 1973 and 2000. David Farr, who was CEO from 2000 to 2021, continued to expand the company&#x27;s reach into international markets and advanced technology sectors. Jim Turley is the chairman, and Lal Karsanbhai is CEO.

Emerson operates through two primary business units: Automation Solutions and Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Its Automation Solutions division focuses on process automation and digital transformation, providing software and engineering services to industries like oil and gas, power generation, and pharmaceuticals. The Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions unit focuses on climate technologies and residential products, including heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, tools, and compressors.

==Environmental records==
In 2008 (using data from 2005), researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Emerson as the 97th largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, down from its previous rank of 56th. Major pollutants indicated by the study include nickel compounds, manganese, diisocyanate, and lead.

Since then, Emerson has made strides in reducing its environmental footprint. According to its 2023 sustainability report, the company achieved a 52% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity compared to 2021 levels. Additionally, Emerson procures 49% of its electricity from renewable sources and has set long-term goals for further emissions reductions.

== Controversies ==

=== NBC &quot;Heroes&quot; lawsuit ===
On October 2, 2006, Emerson filed suit in federal court against NBC regarding a scene that appeared in the pilot episode of the network&#x27;s TV series &quot;Heroes&quot;. The scene depicted Claire Bennet reaching into an active garbage disposal, severely injuring her hand. Emerson&#x27;s suit claims the scene &quot;casts the disposer in an unsavory light, irreparably tarnishing the product&quot; by suggesting that serious injuries will result &quot;in the event consumers were to accidentally insert their hand into one.&quot;

Emerson asked for a ruling barring future broadcasts of the pilot and to block NBC from using any Emerson trademarks in the future.

On February 23, 2007, the case was dropped. NBC Universal and Emerson Electric settled the lawsuit outside of court.

<doc id="1175488" wikidata="Q2878631" url="?curid=1175488" title="Merit badge">
<text>Merit badges are awards earned by members of Scouting America, based on activities within the area of study by completing a list of periodically updated requirements. The purpose of the merit badge program is to allow Scouts to examine subjects to determine if they would like to further pursue them as a career or vocation. The program also introduces Scouts to life skills such as contacting an adult they had not met before, arranging a meeting, and demonstrating their skills, similar to a job or college interview. 

The merit badge award is represented by a circular patch with an image representing the badge&#x27;s topic. The patches for the Eagle-required merit badges are distinguishable by the silver border on the outside edge. Merit badges are displayed on a sash which can be worn with the Scouts BSA uniform on formal occasions. The National Council reviews and updates badges each year. There are currently 139 merit badges.

Scouting organizations in other countries issue or have issued merit badges, including Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, Thailand, and the United Kingdom. Austria has a program similar to merit badges for certain age groups.

==Current badges==
:The last revision date indicates the date of the latest requirement changes; the copyright or printing dates of merit badge pamphlets may have a different date. The Eagle Scout required merit badges are shaded in gray (see above paragraph for details).


==Historical program==
Offered only in 2010, the Historical Merit Badge program, part of the Boy Scouts of America centennial, allowed Scouts to earn the discontinued Carpentry, Pathfinding, Signalling, and Tracking (originally called Stalking) merit badges. The patches for these historical merit badges are distinguished by a gold ring on the outside edge. All were based on merit badges that were among the original 57 issued in 1911.

<text>HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot; was one of 16 destroyers built for the Royal Navy shortly before the beginning of Second World War in 1939. Completed in 1938 the ship was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet. She was briefly involved enforcing the arms blockade on the combatants in the Spanish Civil War in early 1939. &quot;Mohawk&quot; returned home shortly after the start of the Second World War and was assigned convoy escort duties, during which she was damaged by German bombers. She played an active role in the Norwegian Campaign of April–May 1940, escorting convoys to and from Norway.

The ship was assigned to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla (DF) of the Mediterranean Fleet in June and began escorting convoys to Malta and Greece. &quot;Mohawk&quot; played a minor role in the Battle of Calabria in July and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. The following month the ship was sunk by torpedoes fired by an Italian destroyer off the Tunisian coast as the 14th DF attacked an Italian convoy, with the loss of 41 of her crew.

The Tribals were intended to counter the large destroyers being built abroad and to improve the firepower of the existing destroyer flotillas and were thus significantly larger and more heavily armed than the preceding . The ships displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The destroyers were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft using steam provided by three Admiralty three-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . During her sea trials &quot;Mohawk&quot; made from at a displacement of . The ships carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement consisted of 190 officers and ratings, although the flotilla leaders carried an extra 20 officers and men consisting of the Captain (D) and his staff.

The primary armament of the Tribal-class destroyers was eight quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch (120 mm) Mark XII guns in four superfiring twin-gun mounts, one pair each fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The mounts had a maximum elevation of 40°. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they carried a single quadruple mount for the QF two-pounder Mk II &quot;pom-pom&quot; gun and two quadruple mounts for the 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) Mark III machine gun. Low-angle fire for the main guns was controlled by the director-control tower (DCT) on the bridge roof that fed data acquired by it and the rangefinder on the Mk II Rangefinder/Director directly aft of the DCT to an analogue mechanical computer, the Mk I Admiralty Fire Control Clock. Anti-aircraft fire for the main guns was controlled by the Rangefinder/Director which sent data to the mechanical Fuze Keeping Clock.

The ships were fitted with a single above-water quadruple mount for  torpedoes. The Tribals were not intended as anti-submarine ships, but they were provided with ASDIC, one depth charge rack and two throwers for self-defence, although the throwers were not mounted in all ships. Twenty depth charges was the peacetime allotment, but this increased to 30 during wartime.

===Wartime modifications===
Heavy losses to German air attack during the Norwegian Campaign demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the Tribals&#x27; anti-aircraft suite and the RN decided in May 1940 to replace &#x27;X&#x27; mount with two QF Mark XVI dual-purpose guns in a twin-gun mount. To better control the guns, the existing rangefinder/director was modified to accept a Type 285 gunnery radar as they became available. The number of depth charges was increased to 46 early in the war, and still more were added later. To increase the firing arcs of the AA guns, the rear funnel was shortened and the mainmast was reduced to a short pole mast.

==Construction and career==
Authorized as one of seven Tribal-class destroyers under the 1935 Naval Estimates, &quot;Mohawk&quot; was the eleventh ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy. The ship was ordered on 10 March 1936 from John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company and was laid down on 16 July at the company&#x27;s Woolston, Southampton, shipyard. Launched on 5 October 1937, &quot;Mohawk&quot; was completed on 7 September 1938 and commissioned two days later at a cost of £339,585 which excluded weapons and communications outfits furnished by the Admiralty. Under the command of Commander Richard Frank Jolly, the ship was initially assigned to the 1st Tribal Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet and arrived at Malta on 13 October. The following month she patrolled the Malta-Egypt leg of the Royal Air Force (RAF)&#x27;s Long-Range Development Flight of three Vickers Wellesley bombers that were preparing to break the world flight distance record by flying from Egypt to Australia non-stop. At the end of the month, &quot;Mohawk&quot; ferried the British Ambassador to Turkey back to Istanbul from his annual visit to the Helles Memorial and then cruised through the Aegean Sea before returning to Malta.

The flotilla sailed to Gibraltar where the Mediterranean and Home Fleets were gathering for combined exercises. These ran from 28 February to 18 March 1939 and involved dozens of ships from both commands. &quot;Mohawk&quot; then patrolled the waters off the Mediterranean Spanish coast during the Spanish Civil War to enforce the arms embargo imposed on both sides by the Non-Intervention Committee. On 23 March the ship rescued the crew of a damaged German floatplane that had been forced to land off Barcelona and returned them to Majorca. When Fascist Italy invaded Albania on 7 April, the Mediterranean Fleet was mobilised and remained on a war footing for most of May. During this time the 1st Tribal Destroyer Flotilla was redesignated as the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. By July 7 tensions had decreased such that &quot;Mohawk&quot; and her sisters , , and were able to escort the aircraft carrier on a visit to Athens, Greece. The following month, the fleet spent a week exercising in the area between the Greek island of Crete and British Cyprus. As tensions rose in Europe later in August, the fleet was mobilised and continued to train in preparation for war with Italy. As part of its preparations, the Admiralty had closed the Mediterranean to British shipping and &quot;Mohawk&quot; and seven other destroyers escorted one group of ships that had collected at Suez, Egypt, through the Red Sea to reduce the congestion.

=== Second World War ===
When Britain declared war on Germany on 3 September, &quot;Mohawk&quot; was still in the Red Sea. As Italy took steps to prove her neutrality, the destroyers were released from their mission and returned to Alexandria where they began escorting convoys and conducting contraband inspections of non-British ships. This was not the best use of the Tribals and the 4th DF was ordered back to England in October. They arrived at Portland on the 13th and escorted a convoy northwards on 15–16 October. As the ships were approaching Rosyth, Scotland, the Luftwaffe made the first attack of the war on British territory, taking the British by surprise. Only one of &quot;Mohawk&quot;″s AA guns was able to fire before a bomber from I Group/Bomber Wing 30 (Kampfgeschwader 30) dropped two bombs that straddled the destroyer. Near-missing the ship, the bombs detonated on impacting the water and sprayed splinters all along its upper deck, killing 15 men and wounding 30. Jolly was mortally wounded, but refused all assistance and continued to conn &quot;Mohawk&quot; until he passed out. He was posthumously awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal, which was later upgraded to the George Cross. The ship received temporary repairs at Rosyth before she sailed to Hawthorn Leslie&#x27;s shipyard in Hebburn for permanent repairs. The oil tanker struck a mine on 14 December, while &quot;Mohawk&quot; and the destroyer were working up, but the British believed that the tanker had been torpedoed. The two ships were ordered to search for the U-boat believed to be responsible and blundered into the minefield. &quot;Kelly&quot; struck a mine that malfunctioned and did not detonate until it was just abaft the ship&#x27;s stern. The detonation badly damaged her steering and caused her to take on water. &quot;Mohawk&quot; was able to take her in tow until a tugboat arrived, after which &quot;Mohawk&quot; escorted the ships back to the Hawthorn Leslie yard from which both ships had recently emerged.

The destroyer returned to escort duties afterwards, both for convoys and the Home Fleet. While escorting the newly completed ocean liner through the Firth of Clyde on 3 March 1940, &quot;Mohawk&quot; was slightly damaged when the cargo ship collided with her; repairs were completed on 19 March. The 4th DF was then allocated to Plan R 4, a preemptive occupation of cities in western Norway after a German invasion had begun, and was tasked to escort the troop-laden ships of the 1st Cruiser Squadron to Bergen and Stavanger. The Germans decided to move first and occupied most Norwegian ports in a sea- and airborne assault (Operation Weserübung) on 9 April that took both the Norwegians and the Allies by surprise.

====Norwegian Campaign====
Receiving word that the RAF had attacked north-bound German warships in the North Sea on 7 April, the Home Fleet put to sea that evening. The 2nd Cruiser Squadron departed Rosyth with its two light cruisers, escorted by &quot;Mohawk&quot; and the rest of the 4th DF, with orders to sweep through the North Sea before rendezvousing with the main body of the Home Fleet. On the morning of 9 April the 4th DF, minus , was tasked with attacking Bergen, covered by the 18th Cruiser Squadron, but the Admiralty cancelled the attack that afternoon when it received reports that two German light cruisers were in port. As the British ships were falling back on the main body of the Home Fleet, they were attacked by 88 bombers of Bomber Wing 26 (Kampfgeschwader 26) and Bomber Wing 30, sinking &quot;Gurkha&quot; and lightly damaging the battleship .

After refuelling at Scapa Flow the following day, &quot;Mohawk&quot;, five of her sisters and two light cruisers departed on the evening of 11 April, arriving off Stadlandet the following morning. The destroyers were split up to search the area for German ships before rendezvousing with the cruisers at dusk, but an inaccurate spot report of a German battlecruiser and cruiser that afternoon forestalled the searches as the destroyers were recalled. On the morning of 13 April the destroyers were sent to search the Romsdalsfjord and only found four merchant ships. As they were leaving Ålesund they were unsuccessfully attacked by a dozen bombers from III Group, Demonstration Wing 1 (Lehrgeschwader 1). The following morning they were ordered north to the Namsos area to examine its suitability for an Allied landing and to coordinate with local Norwegian forces. Harbour facilities were assessed as inadequate and that troops should be landed elsewhere and transferred to destroyers for off-loading at Namsos. The Admiralty ordered that the 148th Infantry Brigade, already at sea, to be diverted to the anchorage at Lillesjona; its troopships arrived there at dawn on 16 April and began transferring their troops to the destroyers after they had completed refuelling. Half-a-dozen Luftwaffe bombers disrupted the transfer that afternoon with little effect. The destroyers unloaded their troops that night and the rest of the troops arrived the following evening. The destroyers and their covering cruisers were ordered home on 19 April.

&quot;Mohawk&quot; and four other destroyers escorted a small supply convoy to Åndalsnes and Molde that was so heavily attacked by the Luftwaffe on 27 April that they had to abort their mission before two of the ships could complete their unloading. The former town was set on fire, but the ships only suffered splinter damage. They were attacked again the following day as they withdrew. On 1–4 May &quot;Mohawk&quot; escorted the troopship as she transported No. 1 Independent Company to Mo i Rana. The ship embarked British diplomats in The Hague, the Netherlands, on the 11th. With tensions rising with Italy, the Admiralty ordered a total of 17 destroyers, including &quot;Mohawk&quot; and her sister transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet on 14 May, although the destroyer received a brief refit before departing.

====Mediterranean service====
En route to Alexandria, the ship suffered steering problems and had to divert to Gibraltar for repairs, finally arriving on 29 May to joint the 14th DF. On 27–30 June &quot;Mohawk&quot; was part of the escort force for convoys coming from the Dardanelles and Greece to Port Said, Egypt. Italy declared war on 10 June and the fleet sortied that night and sailed to within of the Italian coast, losing an elderly cruiser to an Italian submarine before returning to Alexandria on the 14th. &quot;Mohawk&quot; played a minor role in the Battle of Calabria on 8 July, escorting the battleship . &quot;Mohawk&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot;, together with the destroyers and , were ordered to Gibraltar on 22 August where they were to temporarily join Force H to escort reinforcements for the Mediterranean Fleet as part of Operation Hats. &quot;Nubian&quot; had engine problems that forced her to put into Malta for repairs while &quot;Hostile&quot; struck an Italian mine en route the following day off Cap Bon that broke her back. &quot;Mohawk&quot; took off the survivors while &quot;Hero&quot; scuttled &quot;Hostile&quot; with torpedoes. The three ships arrived in Gibraltar on the 29th; the following day, the destroyers proceeded to sea and rendezvoused with the fleet on 2 September.

&quot;Mohawk&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot; were escorting the heavy cruiser during a bombardment of Bardia, Italian Libya, on 17 September when she was torpedoed by an Italian torpedo bomber. &quot;Nubian&quot; towed her back to Alexandria while &quot;Mohawk&quot; escorted them until they arrived on the 19th. Three days later, the 14th DF, including &quot;Mohawk&quot;, bombarded the airfield at Sidi Barrani and nearby targets; the ship returned on 25 September, attacking truck concentrations. While the bulk of the Mediterranean Fleet covered the aircraft carrier as her aircraft attack the Italian Fleet in Taranto on the night of 11/12 November, Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell took three light cruisers, escorted by &quot;Mohawk&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot; turned north to attack Italian shipping in the southern Adriatic Sea. They encountered a small convoy of four ships, escorted by the auxiliary cruiser and the torpedo boat . &quot;Mohawk&quot; was the first to open fire, claiming a hit on &quot;Ramb III&quot; and then one on the torpedo boat, although both ships were able to break contact. The cruisers sank all of the merchantmen before reuniting with the main body. On the night of 11/12 December, the destroyer escorted the monitor as she bombarded Italian positions near Sollum, Egypt.

====1941====
&quot;Mohawk&quot; was one of the escorts for the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they bombarded Bardia on 3 January 1941. The following week she participated in Operation Excess, a series of convoys to resupply Malta and convey reinforcement for the Mediterranean Fleet past Malta. The ship was part of the escort force for the main body of the fleet until one of the other escorts, the destroyer , struck a mine on 10 January that blew off her bow; &quot;Mohawk&quot; was detailed to tow her stern-first to Malta where they arrived the following day. After refuelling she departed to go to the assistance of the light cruisers and which had been attacked by German Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers. The former&#x27;s fires burnt out of control and she had to be scuttled. The 14th DF covered the bombardment of Tobruk by the Inshore Squadron on the night of 19/20 January. A few days later, the flotilla formed part of the escort for the damaged &quot;Illustrious&quot; as she steamed from Malta to Alexandria on 23–25 January.

For most of the Battle of Cape Matapan, &quot;Mohawk&quot; and the 14th DF escorted the fleet&#x27;s battleships, but they were detached at dusk on 28 March to find and sink the badly damaged . The flotilla turned around about six hours later based on an erroneous report of a drifting battleship and spotted the burning heavy cruiser early on the morning of the 29th after she had been crippled by the British battleships at point-blank range the previous evening. The British ships picked up survivors and torpedoed the wreck. About an hour later they discovered the drifting heavy cruiser which had had all power knocked out by a torpedo hit earlier in the day. The British rescued the survivors crewmen before sinking the cruiser with three torpedoes and rejoining the main body of the fleet.
The 14th DF escorted a convoy from Egypt to Greece from 1 to 6 April, although the convoy was attacked by Luftwaffe bombers, none of the destroyers were damaged. The flotilla arrived at Malta on 10/11 April with orders to interdict the Italian supply convoys between Italy and Libya at night. The first two patrols were uneventful, but British aircraft had located a small convoy off the Tunisian coast on the afternoon of the 15th. The destroyers sortied at dusk to search for the convoy and spotted it in the early hours of 16 April. The convoy consisted of five cargo ships escorted by three destroyers. Captain Philip Mack, commander of the 14th DF, manoeuvred his ships to silhouette the convoy against the moon and closed to a range of only before his flagship, and her sister opened fire on the trailing destroyer, , at 02:20, quickly disabling her guns and turbines, and setting her on fire.

&quot;Mohawk&quot; and &quot;Nubian&quot; were in the rear of the formation and engaged the rearmost freighter, , which was carrying a load of ammunition, causing an explosion and setting her on fire. As the sisters advanced down the side of the convoy, &quot;Mohawk&quot; withheld fire as all of the targets were being engaged. By 02:35 the leading escort, the destroyer , had turned back and was taken under fire by all of the British ships. As the Italian ship was sinking, her crew was able to fire two torpedoes under manual control. The first of these struck &quot;Mohawk&quot; just after she had turned to avoid being rammed by the freighter as the destroyer passed through the convoy shortly after 02:45. The torpedo hit &quot;Mohawk&quot; on the starboard side abreast &#x27;Y&#x27; gun mount, knocking out both aft mounts and blowing off the upper stern. Although the ship had stopped and was up to &#x27;X&#x27; mount, the chief engineer reported five minutes later that he believed that the propellers and their shafts were intact and that the ship could move. Before he could do so, another torpedo struck the port side on the bulkhead that separated the middle and aft boiler rooms at 02:53. Its detonation caused the aft boiler to explode and the upper deck to split down the middle. &quot;Mohawk&quot; capsized a minute later with her stern touching the shallow bottom with the loss of 41 crewmen. The British ships rescued her surviving crew and &quot;Janus&quot; had to put four shells into her buoyant forecastle to put the ship fully underwater off the Kerkennah Islands.

<text>The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) is a research institute involved in the conservation, preservation, and research of old manuscripts and rare books related to Orientalism, particularly Indology. It is located in Pune, Maharashtra, India. It was founded on 6 July 1917 and named after Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar (1837–1925), a scholar of Orientalism. The institute is well known for its collection of old Sanskrit and Prakrit manuscripts.

==The institute==
This institute is of a public trust registered under Act XXI of 1860. Initially, the institute received an annual grant of 3,000 rupees from the government of Bombay. Presently, it is partially supported by annual grants from the government of Maharashtra. The institute also receives grants from the government of India and the University Grants Commission for specific research projects.

The institute has one of the largest collections of rare books and manuscripts in South Asia, consisting of over 125,000 books and 29,510 manuscripts. The institute publishes a journal, &quot;Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute&quot;, four times a year. The institute also hosts the Manuscripts Resource and Conservation Centre under the auspices of the National Mission for Manuscripts, a project of the Ministry of Culture of the government of India. In 2007, the Rigveda manuscripts preserved at the Institute were included in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register.

==The manuscript collection==
The government of Bombay, in 1866, started a pan Indian Manuscript Collection project. Noted scholars like Georg Bühler, F. Kielhorn, Peter Peterson, Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, S. R. Bhandarkar, Kathavate and Ghate collected more than 17,000 important manuscripts under this project. This collection was first deposited at Elphinstone College in Bombay. Then it was transferred to Deccan College (Pune) for better preservation. After the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) was founded in 1917, the BORI founders proposed to offer even better preservation and research. Hence Lord Willingdon, the then governor of the Bombay Presidency and the first president of BORI, transferred the valuable government collection of manuscripts to the BORI on 1 April 1918. The first curator, P.K. Gode took active initiatives to enhance this collection. Presently, the Institute has over 29,000 manuscripts.

The largest part of the collection (17,877 Manuscripts) is part of the &quot;Government Manuscript Library&quot;, while there is an additional collection of 11,633 manuscripts. The most prized collections include a paper manuscript of the dated 1320 CE and a palmleaf manuscript of the dated 906 CE.

Among the several scholars referring to the works at BORI, the most well-known person arguably is the Bharat Ratna awardee, Pt. Pandurang Vaman Kane.

==The critical edition of the Mahabharata==
A long-term project under the auspices of BORI, started on 1 April 1919, was the preparation of a critical edition of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. V.S. Sukthankar was appointed general editor of the project on 1 August 1925 and he continued until his death on 21 January 1943. After his death, S.K. Belvalkar was appointed general editor on 1 April 1943. On 1 April 1961, P. L. Vaidya was appointed as general editor of the project on the retirement of S. K. Belvalkar. R. N. Dandekar was appointed as the joint general editor on 6 July 1957. To widespread acclaim, the completion for publication was announced on 22 September 1966, by Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, then president of India, at a special function held at the institute.

The Shloka composition in the BORI critical edition of the Mahabharata

* Arjuna – 35% in the form of Anusthipchand (various names used as a glorification of the protagonist of the epic)
* Krishna – 19%
* Yudhisthira – 14%
* Bhishma – 10%
* Duryodhana – 8%
* Bhima – 6%

Other characters represent around 10% of shlokas

The critical edition was collated from 1,259 manuscripts. This edition in 19 volumes (more than 15,000 demi-quarto size pages) comprised the critically constituted text of the 18 &quot;parvas&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; consisting of more than 89,000 verses, an elaborate critical apparatus and a prolegomena on the material and methodology (volume I), written by V.S. Sukthankar.

Further work since the initial publication has produced a critical edition of the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, a pratika index, a bibliography of ancillary materials, and a cultural index. The project of preparing a critical edition of the &quot;Harivamsa&quot; was inaugurated by the president of India, Rajendra Prasad, on 19 November 1954. The publication was completed in November 1971. The critical edition in two volumes consists of the four &quot;parvan&quot;s of the &quot;Harivamsa&quot;. The pratika Index in six volumes consists of 360,000 verse quarters with appendices. Two volumes of the cultural index have been published so far. The constituted text of the critical edition has also been made available on CD-ROM.

===Donation by Nizam and the &quot;Nizam guest house&quot;===
In 1932, there was a need for money for the publication of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. A formal request was made to the seventh nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan, who granted Rs.1000 /- per year for a period of 11 years and offered Rs 50,000 for construction of the guest house which is called &quot;Nizam Guest House&quot;.

The office of the university was operated at Nizam Guest House until 1 June 1949.

==Vandalism in 2004==
The institute was vandalized on 5 January 2004 by a mob composed of members of an extremist self-styled Maratha youth squad, calling themselves the Sambhaji Brigade, named after the elder son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

The incident provoked widespread reaction and led historian Gajanan Mehendale to destroy parts of his in-progress biography of Shivaji.

The vandalism and the subsequent ban on the book were denounced in a statement by historians, among whom were R.S. Sharma, R.C. Thakran, Suraj Bhan, Irfan Habib, D N Jha, Shireen Moosvi and K. M. Shrimali. Oxford University Press, publisher of James Laine&#x27;s &quot;Shivaji: Hindu King in Islamic India&quot;, withdrew the book after protests from historian Ninad Bedekar and other right-wing politicians due to objectionable statements about Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

<text>Kęstutis (, ; – 3 or 15 August 1382) was sole Duke of Trakai from 1342 to 1382 and Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1342 to 1382, together with his brother Algirdas (until 1377), and with his nephew Jogaila (from 1377 to 1381). 

The name &quot;Kęstutis&quot; is a derivative from the old form of the name &quot;Kęstas&quot;, which is a shortened version of such Lithuanian names as &quot;Kęstaras&quot;, &quot;Kęstautas&quot; (there &quot;kęs-ti&quot; means &quot;to cope&quot;). Historic writing sources reflect different Lithuanian pronunciation.

==Early life and division of power==

Kęstutis was the son of the Grand Duke Gediminas. His younger brother, Jaunutis, succeeded his father as Grand Duke of Lithuania. Together with his brother Algirdas, Kestutis conspired to remove Jaunutis from power. They were successful in their efforts. They divided their holdings into an eastern and western sphere of influence. The Duchy of Trakai was established in 1337 as a result. Kęstutis&#x27;s efforts were concentrated in the west, while Algirdas&#x27; were concentrated in the eastern part of these territories. Kęstutis organized the defence of western Lithuania and Samogitia against the Teutonic Knights, and organized raids against the German Order. During Kęstutis&#x27;s rule Teutonic raids into Lithuania reached the peak.

==Co-ruler of Lithuania==

Kęstutis employed different military as well as diplomatic means in his struggle on the western borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1349, to avoid further clashes with the Teutonic Order, he started negotiations with Pope Clement VI for the Christianization of Lithuania, receiving promises for royal crowns for him and his sons. Algirdas willingly remained aside of the business and was concerned with the order in the Ruthenian part of the state. The intermediary in the negotiations, Polish King Casimir III, made an unexpected assault on Volhynia and Brest in October 1349 that ruined Kęstutis&#x27;s plan. During the Polish-Lithuanian war for Volhynia, King Louis I of Hungary made a peace agreement with Kęstutis on 15 August 1351, according to which Kęstutis obliged himself to accept Christianity and provide the Kingdom of Hungary with military aid, in exchange for the royal crown. The agreement was approved with a pagan ritual by Kęstutis to convince the other side. In fact, Kęstutis had no intentions to comply with the agreement and ran away on their road to Buda.

==In crusaders&#x27; captivity==

In March 1361, Kęstutis along with his son Patrikas and his brother Algirdas destroyed and took over the Teutonic Eckersberg and Johannisburg castles. A small squad of Teutonic knights which was returning from the failed , attacked the camp of Kęstutis and Algirdas near the Ublik (Wobel) lake. After a skirmish Kęstutis, who was captured by the crusaders, was detained in Malbork Castle. Kęstutis, being over 60 years old at the time, was only defeated by a third experienced knight who attacked him. Negotiations regarding Kęstutis&#x27;s liberation were arranged two times but without results. The ransom, which the crusaders asked for Kęstutis, was most likely too high. Kęstutis managed to escape from captivity about half a year later. He, with the help of his servant Alfas, broke a hole in a three meter-thick wall and left the castle by horses dressed up as Teutonic knights. The escape was well planned and it is assumed that Algirdas and Birutė, Kęstutis&#x27;s wife, greatly contributed to the planned escape.

==Civil war and death==

Algirdas died in 1377 and left the throne to Jogaila, his eldest son from the second marriage with Uliana of Tver. Kęstutis and Vytautas continued to recognize Jogaila&#x27;s authority even when his right of inheritance was challenged by Andrei of Polotsk, Algirdas&#x27; eldest son from the first marriage with Maria of Vitebsk. The Teutonic Knights continued their crusade against pagan Lithuania and both Jogaila and Kęstutis looked for opportunities to establish a truce. On September 29, 1379, a ten-year truce was signed in Trakai. It was the last treaty that Kęstutis and Jogaila signed jointly. In February 1380, Jogaila, without Kęstutis, made a five-month truce with the Livonian Order to protect his Lithuanian domains and Polotsk.

On 31 May 1380, Jogaila and Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės. Based on the terms of the accord, Jogaila agreed not to intervene during attacks by the Teutonic Knights against Kęstutis or his children. However, if providing aid to Kęstutis would be necessary to help to avoid any suspicions, it would not be a violation of the treaty. The motives behind the treaty are not entirely clear. Some historians blamed Uliana, mother of Jogaila, or his adviser Vaidila, while others pointed out generational differences: Kęstutis was about 80 years old and determined not to accept Christianity while Jogaila was about 30 years old and was looking for ways to convert and modernize the country. Still others suggested that the treaty was primarily directed against Andrei and his allies – brother Dmitry of Bryansk and Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitri Donskoi. Jogaila, having secured his western front, allied himself with the Golden Horde against the Grand Duchy of Moscow for the upcoming Battle of Kulikovo.
Without violating the Treaty of Dovydiškės, the Teutonic Knights raided the Duchy of Trakai and Samogitia twice. In August 1381, Komtur of Osterode informed Kęstutis about the secret treaty. In the same month Kęstutis took advantage of Polotsk&#x27;s rebellion against Skirgaila. Jogaila was away to subdue the rebellion and his absence provided a good opportunity to capture Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy. Kęstutis became the Grand Duke while Jogaila was taken prisoner on his way back to Vilnius. Jogaila pledged his loyalty to Kęstutis and was released. He received his patrimony, Kreva and Vitebsk. Kęstutis resumed war with the Teutonic Knights: his army raided Warmia and attempted to capture Georgenburg (Jurbarkas).
On 12 June 1382, while Kęstutis was away to fight Dymitr Korybut of Novhorod-Siversky and Vytautas was away in Trakai, residents of Vilnius, led by merchant Hanul of Riga, let Jogaila&#x27;s army into the city. The merchants were dissatisfied with Kęstutis&#x27;s policies as they were hurting the economy, especially trade with Livonia. Jogaila recaptured the throne and allied with the Teutonic Knights. In the meantime Kęstutis rallied his supporters in Samogitia, his son Vytautas sought soldiers in Hrodna, and his brother Liubartas recruited in Galicia–Volhynia. In August 1382 the armies of Kęstutis and Jogaila met near Trakai for a decisive battle, but it never began. Both sides agreed to negotiate. Kęstutis and Vytautas arrived to Jogaila&#x27;s camp, but were arrested and sent to a prison in the Kreva Castle. Their army was disbanded. On 15 August, five days after imprisonment, Kęstutis was found dead by Skirgaila. Jogaila claimed that he hanged himself, but few believed him. Jogaila organized a large pagan funeral to Kęstutis: his body was burned with horses, weapons, and other treasures in Vilnius, presumably in Šventaragis&#x27; Valley. Vytautas managed to escape and continued to fight Jogaila to become Grand Duke in 1392.

==Legacy==

Kęstutis is a popular male name in Lithuania. Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis wrote a symphonic overture &quot;Kęstutis&quot; in 1902. Petras Tarasenka, Lithuanian historian and archeologist, wrote a short story &quot;Pabėgimas&quot; (&quot;The Escape&quot;) in 1957, depicting Kęstutis&#x27;s escape from the Teutonic Order captivity in Marienburg Castle. The monument to Kęstutis was erected in Prienai in 1937, and was then restored in 1990. The &quot;Grand Duke Kęstutis Motorized Infantry Battalion&quot; of the Lithuanian Land Force was named after Kęstutis. Military district of Lithuanian partisans was named in honor of Kęstutis — Kęstutis military district.

The Millennium of Russia monument has a sculpture for Kęstutis.

==Popular culture==
Kęstutis is featured in the 2021 video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition - Dawn of the Dukes in a campaign detailing the exploits of himself and his brother Algirdas.

<text>HMAS &quot;Warramunga&quot; (I44/D123) was a destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built during World War II, the destroyer entered service in late 1942. She was initially assigned to convoy escort duties, but was assigned to the joint Australian-American Task Force 74 in 1943, and was involved in supporting numerous amphibious landings through the South-east Asian region until the end of the war. From 1950 and 1952, &quot;Warramunga&quot; fought in the Korean War, then was converted into an anti-submarine destroyer. Returning to service in 1954, the destroyer was one of the first RAN ships to operate with the Far East Strategic Reserve, and undertook two tours with the organisation before she was decommissioned in 1959 and sold for ship breaking in 1963.

==Description==

&quot;Warramunga&quot; was one of three destroyers built for the RAN during World War II. The ship had a displacement of 2,031 tons, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a mean draught of . Propulsion machinery consisted of three drum boilers feeding Parsons impulse-reaction turbines, which supplied to the two propeller shafts. The destroyer had a maximum speed of . She could travel at or at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 7 officers and 190 sailors.

When she was launched in 1942, the ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of six 4.7-inch Mark XII guns sited in three twin turrets. This was supplemented by two 4-inch Mark XVI* guns in a single twin turret, a quad-barrelled 2-pounder Mark VIII pom pom, six single 20 mm Oerlikons, a quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tube set, and a rail to launch depth charges. During 1945, the six Oerlikons were replaced with six 40 mm Bofors guns, and two depth charge throwers were added. In 1949, half of the torpedo payload and most of the depth charge payload was removed, to allow for the installation of a new motor cutter. In 1952, the aftmost 4.7-inch turret was replaced by a Squid anti-submarine mortar.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Warramunga&quot; was laid down by Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at its Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 10 February 1940. The destroyer was launched on 7 February 1942 by the wife of Francis Michael Forde, the Minister for the Army. &quot;Warramunga&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 23 December 1942, the day after her completion. The ship&#x27;s name comes from the Warramungu Aborigines.

===World War II===
&quot;Warramunga&quot; was originally assigned to convoy escort duty between Queensland and New Guinea. During April and May 1943, the destroyer was docked for refit. On completion, she was assigned to Task Force 74, which was operating off the coast of Queensland. In July, the Task Force provided cover for Operation Chronicle, the landings at Kiriwina and Woodlark Islands. After was damaged by a Japanese torpedo on 20 July, &quot;Warramunga&quot; and sister ship escorted the cruiser from Espiritu Santo to Sydney. After this, &quot;Warramunga&quot; escorted two convoys from Townsville to Milne Bay, then a force of US Marines from Melbourne to Goodenough Island. After a refit in Sydney, &quot;Warramunga&quot; escorted the cruiser to Brisbane, where the two ships joined Task Force 74. On 29 October, &quot;Warramunga&quot; shelled Gasmata. On 15 December, the destroyer supported the amphibious landings at Arawe. On 26 December, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was involved in pre-landing bombardments at Cape Gloucester.

At the start of 1944, &quot;Warramunga&quot; helped cover the Landing at Saidor, before leaving Task Force 74 for refits in Sydney. After rejoining the task fore at the start of February, &quot;Warramunga&quot; participated in amphibious landings in the Admiralties, at Tanamera Bay, Wakde-Sarmi, and Biak. From May to July, the destroyer was assigned to patrol and escort duties. On 22 July, &quot;Warramunga&quot; and the cruiser sailed to Sydney for refits and leave. Returning in August, the destroyer was involved in the Morotai landings on 15 September. &quot;Warramunga&quot; was part of the covering force for the Leyte landings, and after &quot;Australia&quot; and were damaged during the operation, escorted the two cruisers back to port for repairs.

At the start of 1945, while assigned to Manus Island, &quot;Warramunga&quot;″s Oerlikon guns were replaced with Bofors taken from a disabled US Landing Ship Dock. During the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in January, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was nearly hit by a Japanese kamikaze aircraft, which instead crashed into the destroyer . On 1 May, the destroyer supported the landing at Tarakan, then nine days later participated in landings at Wewak, before sailing to Australia for a two-month refit. On her return to Subic Bay, &quot;Warramunga&quot; was present for the Japanese surrender of the Philippines. The destroyer then sailed for Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed. The destroyer earned five battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1943–45&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;, &quot;Leyte Gulf 1944&quot;, &quot;Lingayen Gulf 1945&quot;, and &quot;Borneo 1945&quot;. After the end of World War II, &quot;Warramunga&quot; assisted in the repatriation of prisoners-of-war, and served four tours of duty with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. On January 28, 1949, the &quot;Warramunga&quot; rescued 35 survivors from the &quot;Taiping&quot;, including the 2 people from the cargo ship &quot;Chienyuan&quot;. Other passengers were rescued by the fishermen from the Zhoushan Islands. Some survivors were unnamed. One survivor died shortly after being rescued.

===Korean War===

On 6 August 1950, &quot;Warramunga&quot; sailed to join United Nations forces involved in the Korean War. Most of the ship&#x27;s first tour consisted of patrols and shore bombardments. In February 1951, &quot;Warramunga&quot; and the U.S. Navy destroyer were sent to recover an intelligence party. En route, it was learned that the party had been captured by the North Koreans, who had set up the extraction to capture the recovery party, and when the two destroyers received the light signal, shelled the area and killed the North Koreans. During May and June, the destroyer underwent repairs for gale damage. On 6 September, she returned to Sydney and docked for refit.

On 11 January 1952, &quot;Warramunga&quot; sailed for a second Korean War tour. During this second tour, which concluded on 12 August, the ship operated on coastal patrols, and fired 4,151 4.7-inch shells. A sixth battle honour, &quot;Korea 1950–52&quot; was awarded to the destroyer to recognise these deployments. On 12 November, the destroyer docked for conversion into an anti-submarine destroyer, including the replacement of her aft gun turret with a Squid mortar.

===Post-war===
&quot;Warramunga&quot; returned to duty in February 1955, and remained in Australian waters until May 1955, when she sailed to the Far East for exercises with the Royal Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy. &quot;Warramunga&quot; stayed in the area, and became one of the first Australian warships assigned to the Far East Strategic Reserve. She returned on 19 December. In April 1957, the destroyer was involved in South East Asia Treaty Organisation exercises. In 1958, she operated again with the Strategic Reserve.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Warramunga&quot; paid off to reserve at Sydney on 7 December 1959. The ship was marked for disposal on 22 May 1961. She was sold to Kinoshita and Company Limited on 15 February 1963, and was towed to Japan for ship breaking.

<text>Algirdas (; , ;  – May 1377) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1345 to 1377. With the help of his brother Kęstutis (who defended the western border of the Duchy) he created an empire stretching from the present Baltic states to the Black Sea and to within of Moscow.

==Early life and rise to power==
Algirdas was one of the seven sons of Grand Duke Gediminas. Before his death in 1341, Gediminas divided his domain, leaving his youngest son Jaunutis in possession of the capital, Vilnius. With the aid of his brother, Kęstutis, Algirdas drove out the incompetent Jaunutis and declared himself Grand Duke in 1345. He devoted the next thirty-two years to the development and expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

After becoming the ruler of Lithuania, Algirdas was titled the King of Lithuania () in the Livonian Chronicles instead of the terms &quot;knyaz&quot; () or &quot;velikiy knyaz&quot; (grand prince).

Two factors are thought to have contributed to this result: the political sagacity of Algirdas and the devotion of Kęstutis. The division of their dominions is illustrated by the fact that Algirdas appears almost exclusively in East Slavic sources, while Western chronicles primarily describe Kęstutis. Lithuania was surrounded by enemies. The Teutonic Order in the northwest and the Golden Horde in the southeast sought Lithuanian territory, while Poland to the west and the Moscow principality to the east were generally hostile competitors.

==Expansion of Lithuania==

Algirdas held his own, also acquiring influence and territory at the expense of the Moscow principality and the Golden Horde and extending the borders of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Black Sea. His principal efforts were directed toward securing the Slavic lands which were part of the former Kievan Rus&#x27;. Although Algirdas engineered the election of his son Andrius as Prince of Pskov and a powerful minority of Novgorod Republic citizens supported him against the Moscow principality, his rule in both commercial centres was (at best) precarious.

Algirdas occupied the important principalities of Smolensk and Bryansk. Although his relationship with the grand dukes of Moscow principality was generally friendly (demonstrated by his marriages to two Orthodox Russian princesses), he besieged Moscow in 1368 and 1370 during the Lithuanian–Muscovite War (1368–1372). An important feat by Algirdas was his victory over the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters at the Southern Bug in 1362, which resulted in the breakup of the Kipchaks and compelled the khan to establish his headquarters in the Crimea.

In a 1371 letter to Philotheus Kokkinos, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Algirdas titled himself as a Lithuanian King, demanded a separate metropolitan bishop (from Moscow) for Kyiv, Smolensk, Tver, Little Russia, Novosil, and Nizhny Novgorod, and denied Muscovite complaints that he attacked Moscow without a reason.

==Religion and death==
According to modern historians, &quot;For Gediminas and Algirdas, retention of paganism provided a useful diplomatic tool and weapon ... that allowed them to use promises of conversion as a means of preserving their power and independence&quot;. Hermann von Wartberge and Jan Długosz described Algirdas as a pagan until his death in 1377. Contemporary Byzantine accounts support the Western sources; future Patriarch Nilus described Algirdas as a &quot;fire-worshipping prince&quot; and another patriarch, Philotheus, excommunicated all Ruthenian noblemen who helped the &quot;impious&quot; Algirdas. His pagan beliefs were also mentioned in 14th-century Byzantine historian Nicephorus Gregoras&#x27; accounts.

After his death, Algirdas was burned on a ceremonial pyre with 18 horses and many of his possessions in a forest near Maišiagala, probably in the Kukaveitis forest shrine located at . His alleged burial site has undergone archaeological research since 2009. Algirdas&#x27; descendants include the Trubetzkoy, Czartoryski and Sanguszko families.

Although Algirdas was said to have ordered the death of Anthony, John, and Eustathius of Vilnius, who were later glorified as martyrs of the Russian Orthodox Church, the 16th-century Bychowiec Chronicle and 17th-century Hustynska Chronicle maintain that he converted to Orthodox Christianity some time before his marriage to Maria of Vitebsk in 1318. Several Orthodox churches were built in Vilnius during his reign, but later assertions about his baptism are uncorroborated by contemporary sources. Despite contemporary accounts and modern studies, however, some Russian historians (such as Batiushikov) claim that Algirdas was an Orthodox ruler. The Kiev Monastery of the Caves&#x27; commemorative book, underwritten by Algirdas&#x27; descendants, recorded his baptismal name as Demetrius during the 1460s. Algirdas married Uliana of Tver by 1350.

Following Wojciech Wijuk Kojałowicz and Macarius I, Volodymyr Antonovych writes that Algirdas took monastic vows several days before his death and was interred at the Cathedral of the Theotokos in Vilnius under the monastic name Alexius.

==Assessment==

Algirdas balanced himself between Moscow principality and Poland, spoke Lithuanian and Ruthenian (among other languages) and followed the majority of his pagan and Orthodox subjects rather than to alienate them by promoting Roman Catholicism. His son Jogaila ascended the Polish throne, converted to Roman Catholicism and founded the dynasty which ruled Lithuania and Poland for nearly 200 years.

Algirdas (, &quot;Alhierd&quot;) is also widely honoured in Belarus as a unifier of all Belarusian lands within one state, a successful military commander and ruler of medieval Belarus. A monument to him has been erected in Vitsebsk in 2014, as part of the celebration of the city&#x27;s 1040th anniversary. Algirdas was Duke of Vitebsk for over 20 years before becoming Grand Duke of Lithuania.

In December 2022, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus issued a commemorative coin dedicated to the Battle of Blue Waters with a portrait of Algirdas.

==Popular culture==
Algirdas features in the 2021 video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition in the &quot;Dawn of the Dukes&quot; campaign, detailing the exploits of himself and his brother Kęstutis.

<text>Digiscoping is a neologism for afocal photography, using a (digital) camera to record distant images through the eyepiece of an optical telescope.

Digiscoping usually refers to using either a digital single-lens reflex camera with lens attached or, more often, a fixed lens point and shoot digital camera to obtain photos through the eyepiece of a birdwatcher&#x27;s spotting scope. The term has also been associated with the use of a digital camera and spotting scope equipped for prime focus photography.

==Origins==
The portmanteau term &quot;digiscoping&quot; (= digital camera + telescoping) was coined in 1999 by French birdwatcher Alain Fossé. Less notable neologisms for this activity are &quot;digiscope birding&quot;, &quot;digiscopy birding&quot;, &quot;digi-birding&quot;, &quot;digibinning&quot; (using digital camera with binoculars), and &quot;phonescoping&quot; (using a digital camera phone with a spotting scope or binoculars).

The origins of the activity called &quot;Digiscoping&quot; has been attributed to the photographic methods of Laurence Poh, a birdwatcher from the Malaysian Nature Society, who discovered in 1999 almost by accident that the new generation of point and shoot digital cameras could be held up to the eyepiece of a standard spotting scope and achieve surprisingly good results. He spread his findings through birding internet discussion forums and one member, French birdwatcher Alain Fossé, coined the name &quot;digiscoping&quot; to describe the technique. Laurence Poh is sometimes credited with &quot;&quot;inventing&quot; the technique although his contribution may be more along the lines of popularizing the idea and refining the technology.

Using a camera with its lens attached at the eyepiece of optical devices such as microscopes or telescopes, creating an afocal system (technically called &quot;afocal photography&quot; or &quot;afocal projection&quot;) had been used for nearly 100 years and digital camera afocal photography was already being employed in the amateur astronomical community. This form of afocal photography became more common in general photography in the 21st century with the spread of point and shoot digital cameras because of the ease of use of this type of setup. Several companies sell couplers and other devices for mounting digital cameras afocally.

<doc id="1175535" wikidata="Q557916" url="?curid=1175535" title="Jaunutis">
<text>Jaunutis (; ; ; Christian name: Ioann; also &quot;John&quot; or &quot;Ivan&quot;; – after 1366) was Grand Duke of Lithuania after his father Gediminas died in 1341 until he was deposed by his elder brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis in 1345.

==Succession==
According to Polish historian Jan Tęgowski, he was probably born between 1306 and 1309.

Jaunutis was not mentioned in any written sources prior to Gediminas&#x27; death. Before Gediminas&#x27; death, all his sons had been granted a domain of Lithuania. Only the second-youngest son, Jaunutis, had not received any domains but lived with his parents in Vilnius. When his father died, he automatically became the ruler of Vilnius and the nearby lands. In Gediminas&#x27; time, it was already customary to regard the Duke of Vilnius as the ruler of the whole Grand Duchy of Lithuania. There are many theories why Gediminas chose Jaunutis, a middle son, as his successor. Some suggested that he was an acceptable compromise between pagan (Algirdas and Kęstutis) and Orthodox (Narimantas, Karijotas, Liubartas) sons of Gediminas. Others claimed that Jaunutis was the eldest son of Gediminas&#x27; second wife; thus the tradition that Gediminas was married twice: to a pagan and to an Orthodox duchess. 

==Rule==
Very little is known about the years when Jaunutis ruled. Those were quite peaceful years, as the Teutonic Knights were led by the ineffective Ludolf König. His brothers were much more active: Algirdas attacked Mozhaysk, Livonian Order, defended Pskov, Kęstutis was helping Liubartas in succession disputes in Galicia–Volhynia. 

Seeing that Jaunutis hesitates to provide help with their military campaigns, his two elder brothers, Algirdas and Kęstutis, agreed to remove Jaunutis and take power into their own hands. Kęstutis, who ruled the nearby Duchy of Trakai, unexpectedly captured Vilnius, he summoned Algirdas and let him rule the whole Duchy of Vilnius. As compensation, the brothers gave Jaunutis the Duchy of Zasłaŭje, but Jaunutis did not want to yield and refused the duchy.

The &quot;Bychowiec Chronicle&quot; mentions that Jaunutis was supported by Jaunė, the presumed wife of Gediminas and mother of his children. She died soon after Jaunutis lost his throne. If he was indeed protected by his mother, then it would be an interesting example of influence held by queen mother in pagan Lithuania. However, a concrete stimulus might have been a major &quot;reise&quot; planned by the Teutonic Knights in 1345.

==Later life==
Jaunutis was supported by his brother Narimantas, who traveled to Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde, to form an alliance against Algirdas and Kęstutis. Jaunutis was imprisoned in Vilnius, but managed to escape and went to his Russian brother-in-law Simeon of Moscow. There Jaunutis was baptized as Ioann, but failed to solicit help (possibly because his sister Aigusta, wife of Simeon, died the same year). Both Jaunutis and Narimantas had to reconcile with Algirdas. Jaunutis became the Duke of Zasłaŭje. The other brothers willingly recognised Vilnius for Algirdas. 

He is presumed to have died because he is mentioned for the last time in a treaty with Poland in 1366, and not mentioned in a treaty with Livonia in 1367. He had three sons, Symeon Zaslawski, Grzegorz Słucki and Michal Zaslawski. Michal ruled Zasłaŭje until his death on August 12, 1399 in the Battle of the Vorskla River.

<doc id="1175543" wikidata="Q925055" url="?curid=1175543" title="William Mahone">
<text>William Mahone (December 1, 1826October 8, 1895) was a Confederate States Army general, civil engineer, railroad executive, prominent Virginia Readjuster and ardent supporter of former slaves.

As a young man, Mahone was prominent in building Virginia&#x27;s roads and railroads. As chief engineer of the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad, he built log-foundations under the routes in the Great Dismal Swamp in southeast tidewater Virginia that are still intact today. According to local tradition, several new railroad towns were named after the novels of Sir Walter Scott, a favorite British/Scottish author of Mahone&#x27;s wife, Otelia.

In the American Civil War, Mahone was pro-secession and served as a general in the Confederate States Army. He was best known for regaining the initiative at the late war siege of Petersburg, Virginia, while Confederate troops were in shock after a huge mine/load of black powder kegs was exploded beneath them by tunnel-digging former coal miner Union Army troops resulting in the Battle of the Crater in July 1864; his counter-attack turned the engagement into a disastrous Union defeat.

After the war, he returned to railroad building, merging three lines to form the important Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), headquartered in Lynchburg. He also led the Readjuster Party, a state political party with a coalition of freemen blacks, Republicans, and populist Democrats. The Virginia General Assembly elected Mahone to the U.S. Senate in 1881.

==Early life==
William Mahone was born at Brown&#x27;s Ferry near Courtland in Southampton County, Virginia, to Fielding Jordan Mahone and Martha (née Drew) Mahone. Beginning with the immigration of his Mahone ancestors from Ireland, he was the third individual to be called &quot;William Mahone&quot;. He did not have a middle name as shown by records including his two Bibles, Virginia Military Institute (VMI) diploma, marriage license, and Confederate Army commissions. Likewise, the General and Otelia&#x27;s first-born son was christened William Mahone. During similar cultural naming transitions in Virginia, the suffix &quot;Jr.&quot; was added to his name later.

The little town of Monroe was on the banks of the Nottoway River about eight miles south of the county seat at Jerusalem, a town which was renamed Courtland in 1888. The river was a vital transportation artery in the years before railroads, and later highways served the area. Fielding Mahone ran a store at Monroe and owned considerable farmland. He also enslaved several people for their forced labor. The family narrowly escaped the killings of local whites during Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion in 1831.

The local transportation shift in the area was from the river to the new technology emerging with railroads in the 1830s. In 1840, when William was 14 years old, the family moved to Jerusalem, where Fielding Mahone purchased and operated a tavern known as Mahone&#x27;s Tavern. As recounted by his biographer, Nelson Blake, the freckled-faced youth of Irish-American heritage gained a reputation in the small town for both &quot;gambling and a prolific use of tobacco and profanity&quot;.

Young Billy Mahone gained his primary education from a country schoolmaster but with special instruction in mathematics from his father. As a teenager, for a short time, he transported the U. S. Mail by horseback from his hometown to Hicksford, a small town on the south bank of the Meherrin River in Greensville County, which later combined with the town of Belfield on the north bank to form the current independent city of Emporia. He was awarded a spot as a state cadet at the recently opened Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia. Studying under VMI Commandant William Gilham, he graduated with a degree as a civil engineer in the Class of 1847.

==Early career==

Mahone worked as a teacher at Rappahannock Academy in Caroline County, Virginia, beginning in 1848, but was actively seeking an entry into civil engineering. He did some work helping locate the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, an 88-mile line between Gordonsville, Virginia, and the City of Alexandria. Having performed well with the new railroad, he was hired to build a plank road between Fredericksburg and Gordonsville.

On April 12, 1853, he was hired by Dr. Francis Mallory of Norfolk, as chief engineer to build the new Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad (N&amp;P). William Mahone, chief engineer, advertised for contractors who would regrade the Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad for 62 miles from the Warwick Swamp of the Blackwater River to Norfolk in 1853. Mahone&#x27;s innovative 12-mile-long roadbed through the Great Dismal Swamp between South Norfolk and Suffolk employed a log foundation laid at right angles beneath the surface of the swamp. Still in use over 160 years later, Mahone&#x27;s corduroy design withstands the immense tonnages of modern coal trains. He was also responsible for engineering and building the famous 52-mile-long tangent track between Suffolk and Petersburg. With no curves, it is a major modern Norfolk Southern rail traffic artery.

In 1854, Mahone surveyed and laid out with streets and lots of Ocean View City, a new resort town fronting on the Chesapeake Bay in Norfolk County. With the advent of electric streetcars in the late 19th century, an amusement park was developed there, and a boardwalk was built along the adjacent beach area. Most of Mahone&#x27;s street plan is still in use in the 21st century as Ocean View, now a section of the City of Norfolk is redeveloped.

Mahone was also a surveyor for the Norfolk and South Air Line Railroad on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

==Marriage and family==
On February 8, 1855, Mahone married Otelia Butler (1835–1911), the daughter of the late Dr. Robert Butler from Smithfield, who had been State Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Virginia from 1846 until he died in 1853. Her mother was Butler&#x27;s second wife, Otelia Voinard Butler (1803–1855), originally from Petersburg.

Young Otelia Butler is said to have been a cultured lady. She and William settled in Norfolk, where they lived most of the years before the Civil War. They had 13 children, but only three survived to adulthood, two sons, William Jr. and Robert, and a daughter, also named Otelia. From 1862 to 1868, the family resided in Clarksville, Virginia at the Judge Henry Wood Jr. House.

The Mahone family escaped the yellow fever epidemic that broke out in the summer of 1855 and killed almost a third of the populations of Norfolk and Portsmouth by fleeing the city and staying with his mother 50 miles away in Jerusalem (now known as Courtland) in rural Southampton County. However, because the epidemic decimated the Norfolk area, with financial consequences as well, work on the new railroad to Petersburg almost came to a standstill.

Ever frugal, Mahone and his mentor, Dr. Mallory, nevertheless pushed the project to completion in 1858, and Mahone was named its president a short time later. Popular legend claimed Otelia and William Mahone traveled along the newly completed railroad, naming stations from &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and other books she was reading written by Sir Walter Scott. From his historical Scottish novels, she chose the place names of Windsor, Waverly, and Wakefield. She tapped the Scottish Clan &quot;McIvor&quot; for the name of Ivor, a small Southampton County town. When they reached a location where they could not agree, Disputanta was created.

==American Civil War==

As the political differences between Northern and Southern United States factions escalated in the second half of the 19th century, Mahone favored southern states&#x27; secession. During the American Civil War, he was active in the conflict even before he became an officer in the Confederate Army. Early in the war, in 1861, his Norfolk and Petersburg Railroad was especially valuable to the Confederacy and transported ordnance to the Norfolk area, where it was used during the Confederate occupation. By the war&#x27;s end, most of what was left of the railroad was under U.S. control.

After Virginia declared secession from the United States in April 1861, Mahone was still a civilian and not yet in the Confederate Army. Still, working in coordination with Walter Gwynn, he orchestrated the ruse and capture of the Gosport Shipyard. He bluffed U.S. Army troops into abandoning the shipyard in Portsmouth by running a single passenger train into Norfolk with great noise and whistle-blowing, then much more quietly sending it back west and then returning the same train, creating the illusion of large numbers of arriving troops to the U.S. soldiers listening in Portsmouth across the Elizabeth River (and just barely out of sight). The ruse worked, and not a single Confederate soldier was lost as the U.S. authorities abandoned the area and retreated to Fort Monroe across Hampton Roads. After this, Mahone accepted a commission as lieutenant colonel and later colonel of the 6th Virginia Infantry Regiment, and remained in Norfolk, which was now under the command of Benjamin Huger. Mahone was subsequently promoted to brigadier general on November 16, 1861, and commanded the Confederate&#x27;s Norfolk district until its evacuation the following year.

In May 1862, after Confederate forces fled Norfolk during the Peninsula Campaign, Mahone aided in the construction of the defenses of Richmond on the James River around Drewry&#x27;s Bluff. A short time later, he led his brigade at the Battle of Seven Pines, and the Battle of Malvern Hill. After the defense of Richmond, Mahone&#x27;s brigade was assigned from Huger&#x27;s division to the division of Richard H. Anderson and fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run, where Mahone was shot in the chest while leading his brigade in a charge across Chinn Ridge. Short () and weighing only , he was nicknamed &quot;Little Billy&quot;. As one of his soldiers put it, &quot;He was every inch a soldier, though there were not many inches of him.&quot; Otelia Mahone worked in Richmond as a nurse when Virginia Governor John Letcher sent word that Mahone had been injured at Second Bull Run, but had only received a &quot;flesh wound&quot;. She is said to have replied, &quot;Now I know it is serious for William has no flesh whatsoever.&quot; The wound was not life-threatening, but Mahone missed the Maryland Campaign the following month. After two months of recovery, he returned to command, not seeing any significant action at the Battle of Fredericksburg. Mahone used his considerable political skills to lobby for a promotion to major general during the winter of 1862–63. Although several of his fellow officers in the Army of Northern Virginia agreed, Robert E. Lee argued that there was no available position for a major general just then, and Mahone would have to wait until one opened up.

Mahone&#x27;s brigade was one of the portions of the First Corps that remained with the main army for the Battle of Chancellorsville. After Lee reorganized the army in May 1863, Mahone ended up in the newly created Third Corps of A. P. Hill. At the Battle of Gettysburg, Mahone&#x27;s brigade was mostly unengaged and suffered only a handful of casualties the entire battle. Mahone was supposed to participate in the attack on Cemetery Ridge on July 2, but against orders, held his brigade back. During Pickett&#x27;s Charge the following day, Mahone&#x27;s brigade was assigned to protect artillery batteries and was uninvolved in the main fighting. Mahone&#x27;s official report for the battle was only 100 words long and gave little insight into his actions on July 2. However, he told fellow brigadier Carnot Posey that division commander Richard H. Anderson had ordered him to stay put. Despite his failure to move his command into action, Mahone suffered no punishment due to his seniority and the fact that he would ultimately become one of a handful of officers in the Army of Northern Virginia to lead a brigade for an entire year&#x27;s duration.

Although his wound at Manassas had not been severe, Mahone experienced acute dyspepsia all of his life. A cow and chickens accompanied him during the war to provide dairy products. Otelia and their children moved to Petersburg to be near him during the war&#x27;s final campaign in 1864-65 as Grant moved against Petersburg, seeking to sever the rail lines supplying the Confederate capital of Richmond.

During the Battle of the Wilderness, Mahone&#x27;s soldiers accidentally wounded James Longstreet. Richard Anderson was appointed to corps command. Mahone took command of Anderson&#x27;s division, which he led for the remainder of the war, starting at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. He became widely regarded as the hero of the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864. There, U.S. Army coal miners tunneled under the Confederate line. They blew it up in a massive explosion, killing and wounding many Confederates and breaching a critical point in the defense line around Petersburg. Nevertheless, Mahone rallied the remaining nearby Confederate forces, repelling the attack, and the U.S. soldiers lost their initial advantage. Having begun as an innovative tactic, the Battle of the Crater became a terrible loss for the United States. Mahone&#x27;s quick and effective action was a rare cause for celebration by the occupants of Petersburg, embattled citizens, and weary troops alike. On July 30, he was promoted to major general.

However, in early April 1865, Grant&#x27;s strategy at Petersburg eventually succeeded in severing the last rail line from the southern states to supply Petersburg (and hence Richmond). At the Battle of Sailor&#x27;s Creek on April 6, Lee exclaimed in front of Mahone, &quot;My God, has the army dissolved?&quot; to which he replied, &quot;No, General, here are troops ready to do their duty.&quot; Touched by the loyalty of his men, Lee told Mahone, &quot;Yes, there are still some true men left ... Will you please keep those people back?&quot; Mahone was also with Lee at the surrender at Appomattox Court House three days later.

==Return to railroading==

After the war, Lee advised his generals to return to work rebuilding the southern states&#x27; economies. William Mahone did just that and became the driving force in the linkage of N&amp;P, South Side Railroad, and the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. He was president of all three by the end of 1867. During the post-war Reconstruction period, he worked diligently lobbying the Virginia General Assembly to gain the legislation necessary to form the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), a new line comprising the three railroads he headed, extending 408 miles from Norfolk to Bristol, Virginia, in 1870. This conflicted with the expansion of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Baltimore and Alexandria, Virginia. The Mahones were colorful characters: the letters A, M &amp; O were said to stand for &quot;All Mine and Otelia&#x27;s&quot;. They lived in Lynchburg, Virginia, during this time, but moved back to Petersburg in 1872.

The Panic of 1873 put the A, M &amp; O into conflict with its bondholders in England and Scotland. After several years of operating under receiverships, Mahone&#x27;s relationship with the creditors soured, and an alternate receiver, Henry Fink, was appointed to oversee the A, M &amp; O&#x27;s finances. Mahone still worked to regain control. His role as a railroad builder ended in 1881, when Philadelphia-based interests outbid him and purchased the A, M &amp; O at auction, renaming it Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W).

Before the Civil War, the Virginia Board of Public Works had invested state funds in a substantial portion of the stock of the A, M &amp; O&#x27;s predecessor railroads. Although he lost control of the railroad, as a significant political leader in Virginia, Mahone was able to arrange for a portion of the state&#x27;s proceeds of the sale to be directed to help found a school to prepare teachers to help educate black children and formerly enslaved people near his home at Petersburg, where he had earlier been mayor. The Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute eventually expanded to become Virginia State University, with Virginia native John Mercer Langston returning from Ohio to become its first president. Mahone also directed some funds to help found the predecessor of today&#x27;s Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County, also near Petersburg. Mahone personally retained his ownership of land investments which were linked to the N&amp;W&#x27;s development of the rich coal fields of western Virginia and southern West Virginia, contributing to his rank as one of Virginia&#x27;s wealthiest men at his death, according to his biographer, author Nelson Blake.

==Political career==
Mahone was active in Virginia&#x27;s economic and political life for almost 30 years, beginning amid the Civil War when he was elected to the Virginia General Assembly as a delegate from Norfolk in 1863. He later served as mayor of Petersburg. After his unsuccessful bid for governor in 1877, he became the leader of the Readjuster Party, a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, and African-Americans seeking a reduction in Virginia&#x27;s prewar debt, and an appropriate allocation made to the former portion of the state that constituted the new State of West Virginia. In 1881, Mahone led the successful effort to elect the readjuster candidate William E. Cameron as the next governor, and he became a United States Senator.

The Readjuster Party did more than refinance the Commonwealth&#x27;s debts. The party invested heavily in schools, especially for African Americans, and appointed African American teachers for such schools. The party increased funding for what is now Virginia Tech and established its black counterpart, Virginia State. The Readjuster Party abolished the poll tax and the public whipping post. Because of expanded voting, Danville elected a black-majority town council and hired an unprecedented integrated police force.

With the Senate split 37–37 between Republicans and Democrats, Mahone and another third-party candidate willing to caucus with the latter had political influence. Under Senate rules, Vice President of the United States Chester A. Arthur, a Republican, would cast any tie-breaking votes. Mahone bargained for significant concessions before he decided to caucus. Despite being a first-year senator, he became chair of the influential Agriculture Committee. He gained control over Virginia&#x27;s federal patronage from President James A. Garfield and by the right to select both the Senate&#x27;s Secretary and Sergeant at Arms.

However, Mahone still faced opposition from the Conservative Party of Virginia, which aligned with the Democrats and grew even more powerful after the 1884 election, when Democrat Grover Cleveland was elected president (with its patronage perks). Mahone maintained his Republican Party affiliation, leading Virginia delegations to the Republican National Conventions of 1884 and 1888. However, he lost his Senate seat to Conservative Democrat John W. Daniel in 1886.

In 1889, Mahone ran for governor on a Republican ticket but lost to Democrat Philip W. McKinney. It was to be 80 more years before Virginia sent another non-Democrat to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion (Republican A. Linwood Holton Jr., in 1969).

==Death==
Although out of office, Mahone continued to stay involved in Virginia-related politics until he suffered a catastrophic stroke in Washington, D.C., in the fall of 1895. He died a week later, at 68. His widow, Otelia, lived in Petersburg until her death in 1911.

==Legacy==
Although Mahone was not to live to see the outcome, Virginia and West Virginia disputed the new state&#x27;s share of the Virginia government&#x27;s debt for several decades. The issue was finally settled in 1915 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that West Virginia owed Virginia $12,393,929.50 (~$ in ). The final installment of this sum was paid off in 1939.

He was interred in the family mausoleum in Blandford Cemetery in Petersburg, Virginia. His widow was interred alongside him. His well-known monogram identifies the mausoleum, an initial &quot;M&quot; centered on a star inside a shield.

Their first home in Petersburg, originally occupied by John Dodson, Petersburg&#x27;s mayor in 1851–2, was on South Sycamore Street. That structure is now part of the Petersburg Public Library. In 1874, they acquired and greatly enlarged a home on South Market Street, their primary residence after that. Virginia State University, which he helped found as a normal school, is a major community presence nearby.

A large portion of U.S. Highway 460 in eastern Virginia (between Petersburg and Suffolk) parallels the 52-mile (84 km) tangent railroad tracks that Mahone had engineered, passing through some of the towns that the two are believed to have named. Several road sections are labeled &quot;General Mahone Boulevard&quot; and &quot;General Mahone Highway&quot; in his honor. The Route 35 overpass of Route 58 in his native Southampton County, Virginia is named &quot;The General William Mahone Memorial Bridge&quot;.

A monument to Mahone&#x27;s Brigade is on the Gettysburg Battlefield.

The site of the Battle of the Crater is a major feature of the National Park Service&#x27;s Petersburg National Battlefield Park. In 1927, the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected an imposing monument to his memory. It stands on the preserved Crater Battlefield, a short distance from the Crater itself. The monument states:

<doc id="1175550" wikidata="Q7344905" url="?curid=1175550" title="Robert Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore">
<text>Robert Graham (1735 – 11 December 1797), who took the name Bontine in 1770 and Cunninghame Graham in 1796, was a Scottish politician and poet. He is now remembered for a poem &quot;If doughty deeds my lady please&quot;, which was later set to music by Sir Arthur Sullivan and also by his great-great-grandson, Rev. Malise Cunninghame Graham.

==Early life==
Robert, the second son of Nicol Graham of Gartmore and Lady Margaret Cunninghame, was born at Gartmore, Perthshire, and educated, along with his elder brother William, at the University of Glasgow (matriculating under Professor Andrew Rosse). 

In 1752, Graham left Britain for the Colony of Jamaica and spent the next 17 years there, becoming a planter, slave-owner, and merchant who profited from his involvement in sugar plantations in the Caribbean. By 1753, at just 18 years of age, he had become receiver-general of taxes. 

==Slave holder in Jamaica==
As a wealthy businessman, Graham acquired enslaved people as domestic servants, oversaw large groups of enslaved plantation workers and later sold the enslaved people he &#x27;owned&#x27; when he returned to Scotland.

Graham writes in his letters of numerous liaisons with enslaved women and this infers he is likely to have fathered children by them. 

Graham represented the parish of St David in the Assembly of Jamaica (1765–67).

He left Jamaica for Britain in 1770 take up his lairdship of Ardoch in Dunbartonshire, having succeeded to the estate (entailed upon him in 1757), on the death of his first cousin once removed, William Bontine, earlier that year.

==Family and marriage==
While in Jamaica, Graham married Anne Taylor, daughter of Patrick Tailzour and Martha Taylor and sister of Sir John Taylor Baronet of Lyssons Hall, in 1764 (as recorded in the Cunninghame Graham Family Bible) and Simon Taylor, one of Jamaica&#x27;s wealthiest merchants and plantation-owners.

He built the current Ardoch House (near Dumbarton) in colonial style for his wife, Anne, to replace the ruinous Ardoch Castle he had inherited from his Bontine cousin. 

Anne died in December 1780, leaving two daughters and two sons. He secondly married Elizabeth Buchanan circa 1783, by whom he had a further son and daughter; they separated in 1787 and divorced in 1789.

==Property==
He changed name twice; firstly, under the terms of an entail by which he inherited the Ardoch estate from William Bontine, he took the surname Bontine until his father died. Secondly, in line with the 1709 entail of William 12th Earl of Glencairn, he assumed the name and arms of Cunninghame, in addition to those of Graham, on the death in 1796 of Maj. Gen. John Cunninghame, 15th Earl of Glencairn and last in line.

From him Robert inherited the Finlaystone estate, so that he is often known as Robert Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore and Finlaystone. At his death, his estates stretched from Perthshire (Gartmore &amp; Kippen), through Dunbartonshire (Gallingad &amp; Ardoch) and across the Clyde to Renfrewshire (Finlaystone); in addition he held the lands of Lochwood in Lanarkshire and his Jamaican plantation at Roaring River.

==Political career==
Graham was elected a Member of Parliament, representing Stirlingshire, in 1794. He was a pro-Jacobin of that time, and identified as a Radical. During his time in the House he attempted to introduce a Bill of Rights which foreshadowed the Reform Bill of 1832.

He was a close friend of Thomas Sheridan, Charles James Fox, Sir Thomas Dundas (later 1st Baron Dundas) and the poet Hector McNeil.

Graham was appointed Rector of the University of Glasgow, holding the position from 1785 to 1787, in which year he instituted the Gartmore Gold Medal (awarded biennially) for the best discourse by a student on political liberty.

==Death and legacy==
In later life he suffered from frequent bouts of gout in the organs. He died at Gartmore on 1 December 1797 and was interred on 4th December in the Gartmore family burial ground.

Robert Burns – whose patron James, 14th Earl of Glencairn, was Graham&#x27;s first cousin – writing to the Edinburgh bookseller, Mr Hill, describes Graham as: &quot;...the noblest instance of great talents, great fortune and great worth that ever I saw in conjunction.&quot;

==Descendants==
Graham&#x27;s great-great-grandson, Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham was a writer, journalist and adventurer. He was also a notable politician, being a Liberal Party MP. and a founder of both the Scottish Labour Party and the National Party of Scotland.

His great-great-great-grandson, Admiral Sir Angus Edward Malise Bontine Cunninghame Graham of Gartmore and Ardoch KBE CB was Royal Navy Flag Officer, Scotland. He was nephew and heir to Robert Bontine Cunningham Graham.

<doc id="1175556" wikidata="Q7991990" url="?curid=1175556" title="Wheel-Trans">
<text>Wheel-Trans is a paratransit system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). It provides specialized door-to-door accessible transit services for persons with physical disabilities using its fleet of accessible minibuses or contracted accessible taxis. Users must register with the TTC who will typically grant access to those with permanent disabilities or show difficulty in traveling short distances. Wheel-Trans only provides service within the city of Toronto and accepts regular TTC fare.

==History==

Wheel-Trans was born out of an initiative by the Trans-Action Coalition, a group led by Beryl Potter lobbying for transit accessibility in Toronto. The paratransit system was officially created in 1975 as a two-year pilot project contracted to Wheelchair Mobile and operated on behalf of Metropolitan Toronto and the province of Ontario until 1976. Only individuals using wheelchairs were accepted as the original 46 users of the pilot project, and rode at no cost. In 1977 the service was contracted to All-Way Transportation Corporation of Toronto before being taken over by the TTC in 1985.

==Operations==
===Service provision===
Service is provided by accessible buses and contracted accessible taxi mini-vans. Wheel-Trans is a door-to-door service. Rides can be reserved up to one week in advance by calling the reservation line, by using the automated Ride-Line touch-tone phone service or by using the recently launched Wheel-Trans Online Trip Booking website.

===Fleet===
Wheel-Trans buses operates as part of the main TTC fleet but do not include wheelchair assessable buses from the regular fleet.

===Contracts===

Most of Wheel-Trans operations are provided by the TTC, but some of the services are contracted out to private operators.

==Assessibility outside of Wheel-Trans==

As for 2017, all 1,869 buses are low floor to allow for easy accessible by mobility devices. While all subway trains are accessible, only 35 of the 69 stations have elevators. The SRT cars are not accessible. On the Toronto streetcar network, the Flexity Outlook streetcars are fully accessible. However, not all stops are easily accessible for customers in wheelchairs, particularly in winter.

<text>The Tairua River is a river located on the east coast of the Coromandel Peninsula in the North Island of New Zealand. It flows north and then northeast for a total of 35 kilometers (22 miles) from its source in the Coromandel Range, west of Whangamatā, passing through the town of Hikuai before emptying into the Tairua Harbour, which opens into the Pacific Ocean at Tairua on the peninsula&#x27;s east coast. The small Shoe Island lies directly opposite the river&#x27;s mouth, 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) out into the Pacific.

== Fishing ==

The Tairua River is used for recreational angling. It features a large rock bed, and is noted for its picturesque landscapes. It supports a variety of fish species, including rainbow trout,  which weigh averagely just under 1 kg. Access to the Tairua River is commonly gained from various central points. The middle reaches can be easily accessed from the Hikuia Valley Road that runs alongside the river for approximately 10 km (6.2 miles). The upper reaches can only be accessed by foot from the track that begins near the bridge on State Highway 25A. For more secluded fishing experiences, anglers often access the river by foot from either the northern or southern ends.

=== Fishing Techniques and Regulations ===
Various fly lures are used for fly fishing in the Tairua River, depending on the season. There are several choices of fly lure. Cicada lures are most commonly used in mid-summer. Green beetles’ pattern is more often used around the month of November. All wet flies are accepted at the river. Spinners may be used only with a small blade tail.  The red and gold spinner patterns are the most common used colours. When fishing in the Tairua River, it is common to only bag up to 5 fish a day. The majority of the fish are usually 30 cm or longer.

<text>Carlota Perez (; born September 20, 1939, in Caracas) is a British-Venezuelan scholar specialized in technology and socio-economic development. She researches the concept of Techno-Economic Paradigm Shifts and the theory of great surges, a further development of Schumpeter&#x27;s work on Kondratieff waves. In 2012 she was awarded the Silver Kondratieff Medal by the International N. D. Kondratieff Foundation and in 2021 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Utrecht University.

==Career==
Perez is currently Honorary Professor at the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose (IIPP) at University College London; Honorary Professor at SPRU, University of Sussex; and Adjunct Professor of Technology and Socio-Economic Development at Tallinn University of Technology (TalTEch), Tallinn, Estonia. She is also the Academic-in-Residence at Anthemis UK. From 2013 to 2016 she was Centennial Professor at the London School of Economics. Prior to that she was affiliated to CERF (Cambridge Endowment for Research in Finance) and the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge. She regularly gives visiting lectures at other universities around the world.

Her career began at the Central University of Venezuela where she studied the structural causes of the energy crisis in the mid-1970s and then in the civil service at the Institute of Foreign Trade in relation to the technology aspects of the North-South Dialogue (1975–1977). As founding Director of Technology in the Ministry of Industry (1980–1983), she established the first venture capital agency, FINTEC. She has been consultant to most of the major public and private companies in Venezuela, in particular to INTEVEP, the Research and Development affiliate of PDVSA, the national petroleum company.

As international consultant, she has worked for various multilateral organizations, including the OECD, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, UNESCO, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, the Andean Pact and the World Bank. She has also acted as consultant for major corporations (including IBM, Ericsson, Telefónica, Cisco, Sogeti, ING Bank and the cooperative Mondragon), industry associations, ministries and councils of industry, Science and Technology, R&amp;D institutes and development banks in many countries in Latin America and in other regions (notably Canada, Norway and Estonia). Several elements of the European Union&#x27;s Lisbon Strategy were based on her work, and in 2015 she was Chair of the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Expert Group for Green Growth and Jobs.

==Theory==
Carlota Perez is a neo-Schumpeterian and Christopher Freeman was her mentor and husband, with whom she closely collaborated. Her articles, from the early 1980s, have contributed to the present understanding of the relationship between basic innovations, technical and institutional change, and economic development. Her 2002 book &quot;Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital&quot; has had a very positive response from academics as well as from the financial and the technology-based business communities. It has been translated into Chinese, Korean, Russian and Spanish. The book has contributed to a Schumpeterian understanding of the link between innovation and financial dynamics. In it Perez, speaking from 2002, lays out a history of five technological revolutions that follow a similar pattern of bang, bust and, hopefully, renewal.

Since the 2010s Perez has been studying the historical role of the state in previous revolutions bringing about such golden ages as the Victorian boom, the Belle Epoque and the Post War prosperity. She has identified the importance of giving directionality to the technological potential installed in the early decades of each revolution and of the role of changing lifestyles in creating new employment. She now proposes that the direction should be smart, green, fair and global growth to unleash a global sustainable golden age of the information revolution

In 2000 Perez co-founded The Other Canon, a center and network for heterodox economics research, with - amongst others - main founder and executive chairman Erik Reinert. Having collaborated with Mariana Mazzucato for the past decade, she was the founding Honorary Professor at Mazzucato&#x27;s new Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at UCL, England, where she does research and gives lectures in the Master&#x27;s of Public Administration programmes .

Techno-economic paradigm shifts

In her 2002 book, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital Carlota Perez explains her theory about techno-economic paradigm shifts that revolve around technology revolution, technical innovation, economy and finance, and society. Techno-economic paradigm shifts are brought upon by the technological revolution. Perez defines technological revolution as a powerful and highly visible cluster of new and dynamic technologies, products, and industries capable of bringing about an upheaval in the whole fabric of the economy and propelling a long-term upsurge of development. Every time a technological revolution takes place a massive replacement of one set of technologies by another also occurs. It can be a substitution through modernizations of existing equipment, processes, and ways of operation. Every technological revolution included changes in people, in the way organizations were run and what new skills were needed, each technological revolution was breaking old habits.

Techno-economic paradigms consist of two parts. It is an ‘economic’ best practice because each technological transformation brings with it a major shift in the relative price structure that guides economic agents toward the intensive use of the more powerful new inputs and technologies. It is a ‘paradigm,’ because it defines the model and the territory for ‘normal’ innovative practice, promising success to those that follow the principles incarnate in the core industries of the revolution. Each technological revolution comes with new industries, products, and infrastructures that help to shape the new set of innovative practices (techno-economic paradigms) which in turn helps different stakeholders to make better decisions during the time period that the set of technologies is relevant. It is a best-practice model for applying a particular technological revolution in the most effective way and when it is adopted by the majority it becomes a common-sense or new normal base to organize activities and institutions.

Social and financial aspects of techno-economic paradigm shifts 

In order for the techno-economic paradigm to take effect, changes have to happen within the society. The new technology that comes with the technological revolution has to be accepted by society. The new products, the new services have to have consumers and users, without them the innovative technology would not take over and become a technological revolution that needs a new set of rules and common sense bases to organize the activities. The changes in technology will eventually bring changes in governance, society, ideologies, and culture, they will include changes in regulatory frameworks affecting markets and economic activities, they will redesign a whole lot of institutions (government organizations, companies), there will be a need for new financial regulations and education. Society is opposed to the new set of rules and ways of doing things, even though they were received as a bright new set of opportunities because it is recognized as a threat to the established way of doing things in society, firms, and institutions The changes are faster in the economy because there the profits and growth are driving the change, it is not the case within the society. The blockage is caused by routine, ideology, and vested interests and that takes time to change. The social tensions are even multiplied by great social costs in the form of lost jobs and skills as well as moving operations from one place to another.

One big part for the technological revolution to happen and the new techno-economic paradigm to set in is finance. Technological revolutions happen when something can be done in a more simple and cost-efficient way with the goal of making more money. Someone has to have enough available money to invest in new technologies that break the routine and make radical changes. That someone has to see this as an opportunity to make a huge profit and put up the money to test the process, launch a product or expand production. Big and established companies are more willing to invest in their own processes and innovation, which does not have that big of an impact or radical change in how we do things.

<text>The Prodi Commission was the European Commission in office between 1999 and 2004. The administration was led by former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi.

==History==
The commission took office on 16 September 1999 following the scandal and subsequent resignation of the Santer Commission which had damaged the reputation of the institution. The college consisted of 20 Commissioners which grew to 30 following the Enlargement of the European Union in 2004. It was the last commission to see two members allocated to the larger member states.

This commission (the 10th) saw in increase in power and influence following the Amsterdam Treaty. Some in the media described president Prodi as being the first &quot;Prime Minister of the European Union&quot;.

As well as the enlargement and Amsterdam Treaty, the Prodi Commission also saw the signing and enforcement of the Nice Treaty as well as the conclusion and signing of the European Constitution: in which he introduced the &quot;Convention method&quot; of negotiation. From 1999 Prodi saw in the euro and by 2002 it came into cash form and the single currency for 12 of the EU&#x27;s 15 member states. The body was however criticised for being lacklustre, with poor communication and failing to make an impact despite major events such as enlargement and the euro.

The commission was due to leave office on 31 October 2004, but due to opposition from the European Parliament to the proposed Barroso Commission which would succeed it, it was extended and finally left office on 21 November 2004.

==Commissioners==

When the Commission took office in 1999, there were 20 Commissioners, one from each member state and two from the largest 5 states (Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom).

2004 saw 15 new Commissioners, 5 replacing existing Commissioners who had resigned before the end of their mandate and 10 from the new member states who joined in that year. Most of these Commissioners continued to serve in the following Barroso Commission.

The members from the new states shared a portfolio with an existing member, rather than creating new posts or having Commissioners (old or new) without a portfolio.

The following table indicates the number of Commissioners according to their political alignment at the start of the commission, those who joined from the new member states and the number when the Commission left office. The colours reflect those used in the table of Commissioners below.

<text>William Hendricks (November 12, 1782 – May 16, 1850) was a Democratic-Republican member of the House of Representatives from 1816 to 1822, the third governor of Indiana from 1822 to 1825, and an Anti-Jacksonian member of the U.S. Senate from 1825 to 1837. He led much of his family into politics and founded one of the largest political families in Indiana. He was the uncle of Thomas Andrews Hendricks, who was also Governor of Indiana and Vice President of the United States. Hendricks County was named in his honor. His term as governor was spent repairing the state&#x27;s finances to later enable large scale internal improvements. The establishment of the basic framework of the state&#x27;s public school system and the transfer of the capital from Corydon to Indianapolis also occurred during his term.

==Early life==

===Family and background===
Hendricks was born in Ligonier Valley, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania on November 12, 1782, the son of Abraham and Ann Jamison Hendricks. His father was a prominent man in the community and a state legislator. He was the brother of Thomas Hendricks and John Hendricks, the uncle of Vice President Thomas Andrews Hendricks, and the father of William Hendricks Jr.

He attended a common school in Ligonier Valley where he was a classmate of Jonathan Jennings and William W. Wick, who later became his close political allies. After completion of the lower grades Hendricks attended Jefferson College (now Washington &amp; Jefferson College) until 1810. After completing college he moved west to Ohio where his older brother Obadiah operated a law practice, and briefly lived in his home. He studied law with him a short time and was admitted to the bar. From 1810 to 1812 he made a living as a school teacher while he studied law in Cincinnati and lived in the home of his sister, Ann. He remained there until he was admitted to the bar.

===Move to Indiana Territory===

After 1813 he moved to Madison in the Indiana Territory. Madison remained his home for the rest of his life. During his early days in there, he set up a printing press he brought with him from Cincinnati, and became the proprietor of the Western Eagle, the second newspaper to be printed in the territory. His paper and the positions he supported helped him to quickly gain popularity in the local community. The anti-slavery eastern part of the territory was at that time locked in a struggle with the pro-slavery western party for control of the territorial government. The Western Eagle combated the pro-slavery Vincennes Sun, and garnered considerable support from the eastern settlers. He later used his printing press to print the first codification of Indiana state laws during his term as governor.

Hendricks married Ann Parker Paul of Hardin County, Kentucky. She was the daughter of Colonel John Paul, who was the founder of Madison. The couple had nine children. William Hendricks Jr became a state legislator. Two sons were killed during the American Civil War and two other children died in infancy. Ann outlived her husband by some thirty-seven years, and died at Madison on September 12, 1887.

==Public office==

===Territorial legislator===
In February 1813 Hendricks was elected clerk of the territorial legislature in Vincennes. In May the capital was moved to Corydon following the outbreak of the War of 1812 and the reorganization of the territory. The legislature, which was then dominated by the anti-slavery and pro-statehood faction, appointed Hendricks as printer and charged with publishing the assembly&#x27;s records. The following year he was elected as a representative of Jefferson County, of which Madison was the county seat. In the legislature he fell into party with speaker Dennis Pennington and the anti-slavery faction. In 1814 Hendricks was chosen to succeed Pennington and became speaker of the legislative assembly. The same year he opened his own law practice and stopped printing his newspaper for lack of time for the enterprise. He received several lucrative positions from the territorial government, including being appointed prosecutor of several eastern counties. He was also appointed by President James Madison as U.S. Attorney for the entire territory.

In 1816 he attended the state Constitutional Convention held in Corydon as an unofficial delegate. Although only two years since he entered the territory, he had become so well known and popularized that he served as the convention&#x27;s secretary. He was again in party with Jonathan Jennings, Dennis Pennington, and others seeking to institute a constitutional ban on slavery. His actions at the convention further strengthened his reputation for business aptitude and political skills.

===Congressman===
Jennings was elected Governor of Indiana in the first election leaving his congressional seat vacant. That same year Hendricks was elected as the only Indiana representative, defeating former territorial governor Thomas Posey. His election occurred shortly before Indiana&#x27;s statehood had been approved by Congress and there was a brief debate about the legality of seating him when he arrived in Washington, D.C., but the situation was resolved in his favor. He served in the 14th Congress, succeeding Jennings. Hendricks was reelected three times, serving from December 11, 1816, until the 17th Congress when he resigned July 25, 1822. In Congress he was a member of the Select Committee on Roads and Canals. He supported legislation to fund the construction of the National Road, which would connect Indiana with the eastern states. He also supported several measures to fund other minor road and canal projects, but was unsuccessful. He was a proponent of rapidly granting statehood to the western states, and delivered several speeches urging the statehood of Illinois and Missouri. In his final reelection bid, he won by a margin of ten to one, and was recognized as one of the most popular political figures in the state.

===Governor===
In 1822 Hendricks ran unopposed for the position of Governor of Indiana and succeeded Jonathan Jennings; Jennings in turn succeeded Hendricks in his congressional seat. Hendricks won 100% of the 18,340 votes, the only governor in Indiana history to win by that margin. He assumed the office on December 5, 1822. While governor he occupied the Governor&#x27;s Headquarters in Corydon, which he purchased from Davis Floyd. He served as governor from 1822 until 1825. He was the last governor to serve while the capital remained in Corydon.

When he came to office, the state was still in a poor financial condition because the state&#x27;s bank failures caused by the Panic of 1819 and the ensuing collapse of the modest internal improvement programs. The state&#x27;s bonds had been depreciated in 1821 and severely hurt the state&#x27;s credit and ability to borrow funds. The state budget was still in deficit, and the state&#x27;s sparse population was producing very little revenue. The situation was resolved by selling public land to raise money to pay off a significant portion of the outstanding debt, and government accounts were moved to the Second Bank of the United States since there were no banks operating in Indiana.

The foundation of state&#x27;s school system—the first state-funded system in the nation—also began to be laid during Hendricks&#x27;s administration. During his tenure as governor each township was granted land on which a public school could be established. The value of these improvements totaled over $1.25 million, making it the highest dollar item on the budget to that date. Construction of the State Seminary, later to become Indiana University, also began during his term. Hendricks also contributed personally to Hanover College. As the state&#x27;s finances would not allow the large-scale improvements Hendricks envisioned, he focused efforts on creating critical routes and approved legislation that required state residents to spend allotted amounts of time helping to build the state roads. Existing roads and rivers were improved by clearing obstacles.

Hendricks codified Indiana&#x27;s laws for the first time in 1822, creating the Indiana Code. In 1824 a Seneca family was murdered by a group of men near Pendleton, Indiana, and tension between the natives in northern Indiana and the settlements in central Indiana moved quickly toward conflict. Governor Hendricks, hoping to maintain peace and enforce justice for the tribe, ordered the murderers to be captured and tried. While one of the murderers escaped, the others where captured and all were sentenced to death. One of the murderers was a minor and was later pardoned by Governor James B. Ray. Governor Hendricks had denied his appeal for clemency and used the execution to show the natives his goodwill. This was the first time a white man was executed for killing a Native American in the United States.

One of his final acts as governor was to approve a move of the capitol from Corydon to Indianapolis. There had been an intense debate to keep the capitol in the south where almost all of the state&#x27;s population resided. Indianapolis was north of the nearest settlement and on the edge of the frontier. Despite considerable pressure, Hendricks signed the measure in late 1824.

===Senator===

On February 14, 1825, Hendricks resigned his position as Governor to become a United States senator after being elected to that position by the legislature, defeating Chief Justice Isaac Blackford. Lieutenant Governor Ratliff Boon had resigned earlier and the governorship devolved to James B. Ray, the Senate president pro tempore. Back in Congress in 1825, Hendricks was an Anti-Jacksonian, supporting federal funding for western internal improvements. He chaired the committee on roads and canals from 1831 until 1837 and joined fellow Indiana congressman Ratliff Boon in support of federal funding for the Wabash and Erie Canal in the Senate. He failed in his attempt to be reelected to his seat in the Senate in 1836. He served in the Senate from March 4, 1825, to March 3, 1837, after having lost the election in 1836 to Whig Oliver H. Smith. Hendricks also served as a trustee on the Indiana University Board from 1829 to 1840.

In 1834, he was one of only two Anti-Jacksonian senators to vote against the censure of President Andrew Jackson.

==Later life==

Having served in public office for twenty-nine years continually, Hendricks returned to private life in Madison in 1839.

During his life he had gathered a large estate which he returned to manage and to also practice law. Being a large landholder in the Madison area, he built many homes and leased them to individuals. In his later years he was criticized for not wanting to sell them, and was accused of behaving in an aristocratic fashion in that regard.

On May 16, 1850, while he was overseeing the construction of his family vault, he suddenly became ill. He died the same day and was buried in the Fairmount Cemetery.

In his obituary the Indiana Gazetteer said: 
&quot;Governor Hendricks was for many years by far the most popular man in the State. He had been its sole representative in Congress for six years, elected on each occasion by large majorities, and no member of that body, probably, was more attentive to the interests of the State he represented, or more industrious in arranging all the private or local business entrusted to him. He left no letter unanswered, no public office or document did he fail to visit or examine on request; with personal manners very engaging, he long retained his popularity.&quot;

Ngatea is the &#x27;service centre&#x27; for the farming area of the Hauraki Plains. It was established in the 1900s as a result of a unique series of canals and stop banks which drained the land and produced rich farmlands for dairy production.

The town also acts as a service town for motorists travelling from Auckland to the Coromandel Peninsula and Bay of Plenty via State Highway 2.

<doc id="1175600" wikidata="Q6972258" url="?curid=1175600" title="National Democrats (United Kingdom)">
<text>The National Democrats (ND) was a British nationalist party in the United Kingdom (UK). The former party chairman, Ian Anderson, died on 2 February 2011, and the party was de-registered with the Electoral Commission on 10 March 2011.

==Formation==
The party evolved out of the Flag Group wing of the British National Front (NF), which gained control of the NF during the early 1990s. Party leader Ian Anderson sought to change the name of the NF to the National Democrats. 72% of the membership voted for the change in a postal ballot; by changing the name it was hoped to avoid the connotations associated with the NF name. However, the move was resisted by other NF members and so the National Democrats came into existence as a new party.

==History==
The party contested two parliamentary by-elections in 1996. In Hemsworth, Mike Cooper received 111 votes (0.5%) and, in South East Staffordshire, Sharron Edwards received 358 votes (0.8%). Although the NDs never took part in regularly scheduled European elections, it did contest the Merseyside West by-election in which Simon Darby stood but only gained 718 votes (1.2%).

In the 1997 general election, the party contested 21 seats and received a total of 10,829 votes, compared to 35,832 for its rivals in the British National Party (BNP), and 2,719 votes for the NF. The party&#x27;s best result was in West Bromwich West, where Steven Edwards received 11.4% of the vote. However, this was not a normal constituency, since this was the constituency of then House Speaker Betty Boothroyd, which major parties by convention do not contest. The party was severely damaged immediately before the 1997 election when it was revealed by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that leading member Andy Carmichael was working for MI5. Where the West Midlands had been a stronghold, it now began to fall apart, and in 1998, the local branch, which included leading ND activist Simon Darby, defected to the BNP, leaving only a small number of party loyalists behind. The party did not nominate candidates in the 2001 general election.

In the early 1990s, the National Front was left a legacy of almost one hundred thousand pounds by a party supporter. Following the 1995 name change to the National Democrats the legacy remained with the National Democrats under the control of Ian Anderson. The money was spent on the purchase of Britannia House – the building doubled as party HQ and the site of Anderson&#x27;s printing business.

The National Democrats attempted to give the impression of attracting a mass membership. It never did; most people who left the NF joined the BNP instead, resulting in the legacy being used for election work and costly deposits, all of which were lost. The party printed a glossy monthly magazine called &quot;Vanguard&quot; that was edited by Blackburn-based Stephen Ebbs which lost money on every print and was subsidised by legacy cash. Publication of the former NF paper, &quot;The Flag&quot;, continued, now in support of the new party.

==Anti-paedophile campaign==
In January 1998, Ian Anderson accompanied members of the anti-paedophile campaign People Power when they delivered a letter to Downing Street demanding tougher action against child abusers. Also in attendance were other extreme right wingers, including Paul Ballard of the BNP and Bill Binding, exposed by &quot;Searchlight&quot; as a leader of the British branch of the Ku Klux Klan and a former BNP parliamentary candidate. A plan to hand out extreme right-wing literature was abandoned when Curtis Sliwa, leader of the Guardian Angels vigilante group, turned up with members, some of whom were non-white. People Power&#x27;s literature was produced by Ian Anderson, from his printing business in Dagenham.

Following this, the National Democrats set up a website called Paedophile Watch to &quot;out&quot; suspected child abusers with leaflets and demonstrations. The site also listed newspaper reports containing the names and addresses of convicted sex offenders. Reporters from the &quot;News of the World&quot; sought information from Ian Anderson for their &quot;name and shame&quot; stunt.

==Change in activities==

By 2000, the National Democrats had ceased to exist with only the &quot;Flag&quot; newspaper being published as an independent publication, without reference to the National Democrats or the Campaign for National Democracy.

By the beginning of 2002, the party continued as a pressure group under the name Campaign for National Democracy; until 2008. The party officially ceased to exist after the death of its leader at the beginning of 2011.

==Leading members==
*Simon Darby, parliamentary candidate, left the party in 1998 for the BNP and became its press officer and deputy leader.
*Martin Wingfield, co-editor of &quot;The Flag&quot;, left the party in 2001 and joined the BNP and became editor of its &quot;Voice of Freedom&quot; paper.
*Sharron Edwards, parliamentary candidate, left the party in 1999, stood as first candidate on the West Midlands list for the BNP in the 1999 European elections and later became deputy chairwoman of the BNP before helping to form the Freedom Party.

==Parliamentary election results==
===1996-1997 by-elections ===
===1997 general election===
The party contested 21 seats, receiving a total of 10,829 votes (less than 0.1% of the total). No candidates were elected, and the party lost all but one of its deposits.

<text>The Kaknäs tower () is a telecommunications tower located at Ladugårdsgärdet in Stockholm, Sweden. The tower is a major hub of Swedish television, radio and satellite broadcasts. It was finished in 1967, designed by architect Bengt Lindroos, and the height is or with the top antenna included. For a few years Kaknästornet was the tallest building in the Nordic countries until Näsinneula was opened in Tampere, Finland in 1971. It was surpassed in 2005 by the Turning Torso in Malmö. The tower is owned by the national Swedish broadcasting company Teracom. Its name comes from the ancient name of the area, Kaknäs.

The tower used to be open to the public, with an information centre and gift shop, indoor and outdoor observation decks as well as a restaurant, but has now been permanently closed to the public since 2018 on the grounds that the security repairs would have become too expensive. It was later revealed that the real cause is the threat of foreign intelligence. The fear is that a foreign power would seek to take control of important communication lines and systems of society. According to Swedish television, the Swedish security police have stated in a report in 2017 that the number of foreign intelligence companies has increased, and the tower will be closed due to the report.

Since December 2019, it is forbidden to photograph, copy, measure or describe the tower without permission.

<doc id="1175609" wikidata="Q1502241" url="?curid=1175609" title="Genital tubercle">
<text>A genital tubercle, phallic tubercle, or clitorophallic structure is a body of tissue present in the development of the reproductive system of amniotes. It forms in the ventral, caudal region of mammalian embryos of both sexes, and eventually develops into a primordial phallus. In the human fetus, the genital tubercle develops around week four of gestation, and by week nine, becomes recognizably either a clitoris or penis. This should not be confused with the sinus tubercle which is a proliferation of endoderm induced by paramesonephric ducts. Even after the phallus is developed (either a penile shaft or clitoral shaft), the term genital tubercle remains, but only as the terminal end of it, which develops into either the glans penis or the glans clitoridis.

In the development of the male fetus, the two sides of the tubercle approach ventrally forming a hollow tube that encloses the male urethra. The two glans wings merge in the midline forming the septum glandis. In the female fetus, the tubercle is attached to the vestibular folds that remain unfused forming the labia minora and the vaginal vestibule in between. The genital tubercle is sensitive to dihydrotestosterone and rich in 5-alpha-reductase, so that the amount of fetal testosterone present after the second month is a major determinant of phallus size at birth.

<text>Victor Hasselblad (8 March 1906 – 5 August 1978) was a Swedish inventor and photographer, known for inventing the Hasselblad 6x6 cm medium format camera.

==Life and work==
Hasselblad was born in Gothenburg. In 1940 Swedish Air Force officers requested Hasselblad to construct a camera that rivaled the one found in a German reconnaissance aircraft shot down over Sweden. Hasselblad founded the Victor Hasselblad AB company in 1941 to produce cameras for the Swedish Air Force.

Hasselblad was famous for always trying out Hasselblad AB&#x27;s new camera models by photographing birds. For example, Hasselblad 2000 was tried a week at Nidingen, the only place in Sweden where the black-legged kittiwake nests.

By 1948, the company introduced the first civilian Hasselblad camera, the 1600F, in New York City. Over time, Hasselblad has become a standard camera for many professional photographers.

On his death, Hasselblad willed SEK 78 million (US$8 million) to the Erna and Victor Hasselblad Foundation.

In 1980 Hasselblad was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

<doc id="1175634" wikidata="Q5599991" url="?curid=1175634" title="Great South Road, New Zealand">
<text>The Great South Road is a major arterial road on the Auckland isthmus and South Auckland. Originally the northern section of the earliest highway between Auckland and Wellington, in the North Island of New Zealand, the road was the main route connecting Auckland to Hamilton. Many former sections of the road have been integrated into the Waikato Expressway. Currently four sections of the road remain: Epsom to Bombay in Auckland, the main street in Pōkeno, the former route of State Highway 1 that links the towns of Huntly, Taupiri, Ngāruawāhia and Horotiu, and the main road in Ōhaupō.

== History ==

Many sections of Great South Road were constructed on &quot;ara hīkoi&quot;; traditional walking paths used by Tāmaki Māori. The first sections of Great South Road were constructed in 1843. In 1851, the Tāmaki Bridge was constructed between Ōtāhuhu and Papatoetoe, opening up the south for greater development. By 1855, the road had reached as far south as Drury, from which a track led towards the Waikato River. In 1861, Governor George Grey ordered the construction of the Great South Road further into the Waikato, to improve supply lines through swampy and thickly forested country, prior to the Invasion of the Waikato. The road was constructed by British Army troops, including Dominic Jacotin Gamble, and provided a flow of supplies for the Waikato campaign. Queen&#x27;s Redoubt at Pōkeno was a major base of operations for soldiers working on constructing the road. Approximately 12,000 soldiers were involved in the construction over two years.

Redoubts were constructed along the road for protection. St John&#x27;s Redoubt was constructed in 1863 but never saw any engagement and the redoubt was abandoned shortly after in 1864.

Toll booths were set up along the road in 1866 at Newmarket, Ōtāhuhu and Drury in order to pay for upkeep costs of the Great South Road. Travellers along the Great South Road complained about the excessive cost of these tolls, which were abolished in 1875. After the wars, more peaceful uses predominated, and the road became the main social and commercial link to the growing agricultural areas south of Auckland.

Much of the road between Newmarket and Drury was laid in concrete in the 1920s, up to one foot thick. The road was later covered with asphalt. Originally, the road was marked by milestones, but these are now all believed lost, although there is a ‘22 mile’ milestone marker outside Drury School, in Drury. The Auckland Southern Motorway has largely superseded Great South Road as a through route, but many parts of the road are still in use, particularly the urban sections.

== Route ==
The road begins in the central Auckland suburb of Epsom, then passes through the suburbs of Greenlane, Penrose, Ōtāhuhu, Papatoetoe, Manukau, Manurewa and Papakura. Leaving the urban sprawl, it heads south through Drury before terminating at Mill Road in Bombay and merging with the Waikato Expressway. Historically it continued, over the Bombay Hills, and followed the east bank of the Waikato River until crossing it at Ngāruawāhia. A section of State Highway 3 through Ōhaupō retains the road&#x27;s southernmost extension.

== Duplicate addresses ==
Along the 42 km of road, there are many instances of duplicate addresses. The address numbering restarts six times, being differentiated in Google Maps by suburb. For example there are five &quot;1 Great South Road&quot; addresses.

<doc id="1175637" wikidata="Q673514" url="?curid=1175637" title="Renaissance fair">
<text>A Renaissance Festival (medieval fair or ren faire) is an outdoor gathering that aims to entertain its guests by recreating a historical setting, most often the English Renaissance.

Renaissance festivals generally include costumed entertainers or fair-goers, musical and theatrical acts, art and handicrafts for sale, and festival food. These fairs are open to the public and typically commercial. Some are permanent theme parks, while others are short-term events in a fairground, winery, or other large spaces. Some Renaissance fairs offer campgrounds for those who wish to stay more than one day.

Many Renaissance fairs are set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Some are set earlier, during the reign of Henry VIII, or in other countries, such as France. Others are set outside the era of the Renaissance; these may include earlier medieval periods such as the Viking Age or later periods such as the Golden Age of Piracy. Some engage in deliberate &#x27;time travel&#x27; by encouraging participants to wear costumes representing several eras in a broad time period. Renaissance fairs encourage visitors to engage with costumes and audience participation, often renting outfits to fairgoers. Many welcome fantasy elements like wizards and elves.

==Characteristics==


Most Renaissance fairs are arranged to represent an imagined English village during the reign of Elizabeth I, often thought of as the height of the English Renaissance.

Within a modern Renaissance festival, there are stages or performance areas set up for scheduled shows, such as plays in Shakespearean or commedia dell&#x27;arte traditions, as well as anachronistic audience participation in comedy routines. Other performances include dancers, magicians, musicians, jugglers, and singers. Between the stages, the streets (&#x27;lanes&#x27;) are lined with stores (&#x27;shoppes&#x27;) and stalls where independent vendors sell themed handcrafts, clothing, books, and artwork.

Renaissance fairs typically feature a wide variety of foods inspired by both medieval cuisine and typical American fair foods like corn dogs. Some foods, like turkey legs, steak on a stick, and bread bowls have become iconic of Renaissance festivals. Beer, mead, and wine are also common.

Games include typical fair events, such as archery, axe-throwing, and dunk tanks. Rides are typically not machine-powered; various animal rides and human-powered swings are common, as are live animal displays and falconry exhibitions. Larger Renaissance fairs often include a joust as a main attraction. PETA and Born Free USA have protested the use of elephants and camels at the Maryland Renaissance Festival and Arizona Renaissance Festival.

In addition to staged performances, a major attraction of Renaissance fairs are professional and amateur crowds of actors who play historical figures, roaming the fairgrounds and interacting with visitors. Some allow visitors to bring peace-bonded weapons, while others only allow fair employees to wear them. The Renaissance fair subculture&#x27;s word for costumed guests is &#x27;playtrons,&#x27; a portmanteau of the words player and patron. This adds enjoyment to guests&#x27; experience by &#x27;getting into the act&#x27; as Renaissance Lords and Ladies, peasants, pirates, belly dancers, or fantasy characters. However, many Renaissance fairs discourage interaction between the official cast and so-called &#x27;playtrons.&#x27;

Most fairs have an end-of-the-day ritual parade, dance, or concert where all employees gather and bid farewell to the patrons.

Renaissance fairs are staged around the world at different times of the year. Fair vendors, actors, and crew often work by going from event to event as one fair ends and another begins.

==History in the United States==
In post-World War II America, there was a resurgence of interest in medieval and Renaissance culture. Folk musician and traditionalist John Langstaff gained popularity in the 1950s as part of an early music revival trend. In 1957, Langstaff hosted &quot;A Christmas Masque of Traditional Revels&quot; in New York City, and another the following year in Washington, D.C. A televised version was broadcast on the &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot; in 1966 which included Dustin Hoffman playing the part of the dragon slain by Saint George. In 1971, Langstaff established a permanent Christmas Revels in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1963, Los Angeles schoolteacher Phyllis Patterson held a small Renaissance fair as a class activity, using the backyard of her Laurel Canyon home in the Hollywood Hills as the fairgrounds. On May 11 and 12 in the same year, Patterson and her husband, Ron Patterson, presented the first &quot;Renaissance Pleasure Faire&quot; as a one-weekend fundraiser for a radio station KPFK, drawing some eight thousand people. The Living History Center designed the fair to resemble a springtime market fair of the period.

Many original booths were free-of-charge reenactments of historical activities, including printing presses and blacksmiths. The first commercial vendors were artisans and food merchants, and had to demonstrate historical accuracy or plausibility for their wares. Volunteers were organized into &quot;guilds&quot; to focus on specific reenactment roles (musicians, military, Celtic clans, peasants, etc.). Both actors and vendors were required to stay &quot;in character&quot; while working by speaking with period language, accents, and mannerisms.

The original Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California (RPFS) was held in the spring of 1966 at the Paramount Ranch located in Agoura, California, focusing on the practices of old English springtime markets and &quot;Maying&quot; customs. In 1967, the Pattersons created a fall Renaissance fair with a harvest festival theme at what is now China Camp State Park in San Rafael, California. The fall fair was moved in 1971 to the Black Point Forest in Novato, California. Both fairs developed into local traditions and began a movement that spread across the country.

Although historical reenactments are not exclusive to the United States, Renaissance fairs are largely an American variation on the idea of reenactments. European historical fairs, such as those held at Kentwell Hall in Suffolk, England, operate more on the living history museum model, in which an actual historic site is staffed by reenactors who explain historical life to modern visitors, rather than acting in a role.

In recent years, American-style Renaissance fairs have made inroads in other countries. Germany has seen a very similar phenomenon since the 1980s, and fairs have grown increasingly popular in Canada and Australia since the mid-1990s.
Spinoffs of Renaissance fairs also include fairs set in other time periods, such as Christmas fairs set in Charles Dickens&#x27; London.

==Names==
Renaissance fairs have several variant names, many of which use old-fashioned spellings such as &quot;faire&quot; or &quot;fayre&quot;. These spellings originate from the Middle English &quot;feire&quot; (variant spellings include &quot;feyre&quot;, &quot;faire&quot;, and &quot;fayre&quot;), which comes from the Anglo-French word &quot;feire&quot;. They can also be referred to as Elizabethan, Medieval, or Tudor fairs or festivals.

A German &quot;Mittelaltermarkt&quot; (literally &quot;medieval market&quot;) resembles a Renaissance fair. Many Catalan towns hold &quot;Mercats Medievals&quot; (literally &quot;medieval markets&quot;) as part of their annual festivities.

==Internal debates==
Within the Renaissance fair community, there are different opinions on the desirability of &#x27;authenticity&#x27; at festivals. Some believe fairs should be as authentic an experience as possible, supplemented with educational aspects similar to European living history museums. Others believe that entertainment is the primary goal. Richard Shapiro, who founded what later became the Bristol Renaissance Faire outside Chicago in 1972, favored entertainment, saying &quot;we were so authentic back then it was almost painful.&quot; Festival organizers sometimes attempt a balance between authenticity and entertainment. In 1968, Phyllis Patterson, founder of the California Renaissance Pleasure Faires, also created the Living History Centre, a California-based educational and cultural foundation. The foundation&#x27;s motto &quot;we trick into learning with a laugh&quot; reflects a belief in merging history and entertainment.

<doc id="1175638" wikidata="Q2201031" url="?curid=1175638" title="New Caledonia (Canada)">
<text>New Caledonia was a fur-trading district of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company that comprised the territory of the north-central portions of present-day British Columbia, Canada. Though not a British colony, New Caledonia was part of the British claim to North America. Its administrative centre was Fort St. James. The rest of what is now mainland British Columbia was called the Columbia Department by the British, and the Oregon Country by the Americans. Even before the partition of the Columbia Department by the Oregon Treaty in 1846, New Caledonia was often used to describe anywhere on the mainland not in the Columbia Department, such as Fort Langley in the Fraser Valley.

==Fur-trading district==
The explorations of James Cook and George Vancouver, and the concessions of Spain in 1792 established the British claim to the coast north of California. Similarly, British claims were established inland via the explorations of such men as Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Simon Fraser, Samuel Black, David Thompson, and John Finlay, and by the subsequent establishment of fur trading posts by the North West Company and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). However, until 1849, the region which now comprises British Columbia was an unorganized area of British North America. Unlike Rupert&#x27;s Land to the north and east, the departments of New Caledonia and its southern neighbour, Columbia, were not concessions to HBC. Rather, the company was simply granted a monopoly to trade with the First Nations inhabitants after its merger with the North West Company in 1821.

For all intents and purposes, New Caledonia came into being with the establishment of the first British fur trading posts west of the Rocky Mountains by Simon Fraser and his crew, during their explorations of 1805–08. These were Fort George (later Prince George) at the junction of the Fraser and Nechako rivers, Fort Fraser on Fraser Lake, Hudson&#x27;s Hope, near the Peace River Canyon, Fort McLeod on McLeod Lake, north of Fort George, and the administrative headquarters of the district, Fort St. James, on the shore of Stuart Lake. In its proper sense, New Caledonia at first thus comprised the territory of the northwestern Interior Plateau drained by the Peace, Stuart and Bulkley river systems. The origin of the name is generally attributed to Simon Fraser and his companions, to whom the hills and woodlands were reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands.

==Shifting boundaries and designations==
The boundaries of the department were vague, and changed over time. For all practical purposes, New Caledonia extended as far as the economic relationships enjoyed by its designated trading posts, which greatly expanded over the years. The eastern boundary had been considered to be the Rocky Mountains, the northern boundary the Finlay River, and the southern boundary the Cariboo or the Thompson River drainage. The region south of the Thompson River and north of the then Mexico border, the 42nd parallel north, was designated as the Columbia District. The Columbia Department was governed first from Fort Astoria, then from Fort Vancouver (present day Vancouver, Washington). Westward migration of American settlers by the Oregon Trail led to the Oregon boundary dispute. The signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846 ended disputed joint occupation of areas west of the Rocky Mountains pursuant to the Treaty of 1818. The southern boundary of the district was shifted north to the 49th parallel, and administration shifted to Fort Victoria. Nonetheless, in popular parlance, the entire British-held mainland north of the US boundary and west of the Rockies was known as New Caledonia.

In 1849, Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia were designated a crown colony in their own right, the Colony of Vancouver Island.

==From New Caledonia to British Columbia==

New Caledonia continued over the next few years to be administered by the HBC, whose regional chief executive, James Douglas, also happened to be governor of Vancouver Island. This situation was manageable, so long as the European population remained small (about 100, mostly Company employees and their families). All this changed in 1858, however, with the discovery of gold north of Yale, prompting the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and the influx of twenty to thirty thousand people, mostly American. Douglas, who had no legal authority over the region, felt compelled to exert British sovereignty by placing a gunboat at the mouth of the Fraser River in order to obtain licence fees from prospectors seeking to travel upstream. The British colonial office was prompted into action, and legislation was passed designating New Caledonia a crown colony on August 2, 1858. The name given the new entity was the Colony of British Columbia, and a new capital, New Westminster, was established on the southern reaches of the Fraser River.

The name New Caledonia is still used in official and commercial names in the region (e.g., the College of New Caledonia and the Diocese of Caledonia in Prince George; Caledonia Sr. Secondary School in Terrace).

The Greenway is a long footpath and cycleway in London, mostly in the London Borough of Newham, on the embankment containing the Joseph Bazalgette Northern Outfall Sewer.

==Route==

The western end of the Greenway is Victoria Park, London (London Borough of Tower Hamlets). The route runs alongside Wick Lane, under the East Cross Route to Fish Island. It then crosses the River Lea into Newham, continuing to Stratford and West Ham. The eastern end is at Royal Docks Road in Beckton.

The Capital Ring Walk (section 14) follows the Greenway for most of its distance, and forms part 4 of the 2012 Jubilee Greenway

The western half of the Greenway embankment is roughly at house eaves height giving a view over the surrounding flat area (see gallery pictures). Between Stratford High Street and Beckton the route is flat. There is a renewed tarmac surface along its full length, with grass kept short on either side and bushes/trees on the embankment sides. The tarmac area is the width of a narrow two way road allowing easy passing of pedestrians and cyclists, with approx the same width of grass on either side.

The Greenway and several surrounding areas have been recognised by the Mayor of London and the London boroughs as a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) since 2016.

In mid-2018, Transport for London designated the section of the Greenway between the A13 and A118 as Quietway 22.

A similar path called the Ridgeway covers the Southern Outfall Sewer.

==Renovation==

Work has taken place to resurface and renovate the route—especially around the Olympic Park.

A community group was set up in 2016 for Greenway users, and Newham Council began piloting better lighting, with a view to opening the Greenway 24 hours a day. Greenway Users have subsequently set up a Greenway Action Group to improve the recording of incidents by logging crimes on the pathway.

The renovation of the Greenway was finished in July 2019, after the completion of major water supply works by Thames Water along the western half and the opening of the bridges over the Waterworks River and the City Mill River.

In 2022, the Greenway was the site of one of 19 projects selected by the Mayor of London&#x27;s Rewild London Fund to help &#x27;rewild the city and recover nature&#x27;.

The View Tube, made from recycled shipping containers, is a viewing platform on the Greenway incorporating the Container Café.

Bow Goods yard, a large plot of land situated between the Greenway and the railway tracks between Stratford and central London is set to become a rail freight campus and last-mile logistics hub. 

==History==
The older alternative name for the route is &quot;Sewerbank&quot;, with the name Greenway introduced after a renovation in the mid-1990s.

In 1931 Mahatma Gandhi visited London for a period of 3 months for talks on the future of India, he based himself at Kingsley Hall in Bromley-by-Bow. His host there, the Christian Socialist Muriel Lester described his long early morning walks, beginning before sunrise, and which often took in the Sewerbank through Stratford to Plaistow. Gandhi enjoyed the elevated view the bank offered, and on these walks he would always gather a collection of well-wishers eager to speak to him.

<doc id="1175649" wikidata="Q902252" url="?curid=1175649" title="Complement graph">
<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, the complement or inverse of a graph is a graph on the same vertices such that two distinct vertices of are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in . That is, to generate the complement of a graph, one fills in all the missing edges required to form a complete graph, and removes all the edges that were previously there. 

The complement is not the set complement of the graph; only the edges are complemented.

==Definition==
Let be a simple graph and let consist of all 2-element subsets of . Then is the complement of , where is the relative complement of in . For directed graphs, the complement can be defined in the same way, as a directed graph on the same vertex set, using the set of all 2-element ordered pairs of in place of the set in the formula above. In terms of the adjacency matrix &quot;A&quot; of the graph, if &quot;Q&quot; is the adjacency matrix of the complete graph of the same number of vertices (i.e. all entries are unity except the diagonal entries which are zero), then the adjacency matrix of the complement of &quot;A&quot; is &quot;Q-A&quot;.

The complement is not defined for multigraphs. In graphs that allow self-loops (but not multiple adjacencies) the complement of may be defined by adding a self-loop to every vertex that does not have one in , and otherwise using the same formula as above. This operation is, however, different from the one for simple graphs, since applying it to a graph with no self-loops would result in a graph with self-loops on all vertices.

==Applications and examples==
Several graph-theoretic concepts are related to each other via complementation:
*The complement of an edgeless graph is a complete graph and vice versa.
*Any induced subgraph of the complement graph of a graph is the complement of the corresponding induced subgraph in .
*An independent set in a graph is a clique in the complement graph and vice versa. This is a special case of the previous two properties, as an independent set is an edgeless induced subgraph and a clique is a complete induced subgraph.
*The automorphism group of a graph is the automorphism group of its complement.
*The complement of every triangle-free graph is a claw-free graph, although the reverse is not true.

==Self-complementary graphs and graph classes==

A self-complementary graph is a graph that is isomorphic to its own complement. Examples include the four-vertex path graph and five-vertex cycle graph. There is no known characterization of self-complementary graphs.

Several classes of graphs are self-complementary, in the sense that the complement of any graph in one of these classes is another graph in the same class.
*Perfect graphs are the graphs in which, for every induced subgraph, the chromatic number equals the size of the maximum clique. The fact that the complement of a perfect graph is also perfect is the perfect graph theorem of László Lovász.
*Cographs are defined as the graphs that can be built up from single vertices by disjoint union and complementation operations. They form a self-complementary family of graphs: the complement of any cograph is another different cograph. For cographs of more than one vertex, exactly one graph in each complementary pair is connected, and one equivalent definition of cographs is that each of their connected induced subgraphs has a disconnected complement. Another, self-complementary definition is that they are the graphs with no induced subgraph in the form of a four-vertex path.
*Another self-complementary class of graphs is the class of split graphs, the graphs in which the vertices can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set. The same partition gives an independent set and a clique in the complement graph.
*The threshold graphs are the graphs formed by repeatedly adding either an independent vertex (one with no neighbors) or a universal vertex (adjacent to all previously-added vertices). These two operations are complementary and they generate a self-complementary class of graphs.

==Algorithmic aspects==
In the analysis of algorithms on graphs, the distinction between a graph and its complement is an important one, because a sparse graph (one with a small number of edges compared to the number of pairs of vertices) will in general not have a sparse complement, and so an algorithm that takes time proportional to the number of edges on a given graph may take a much larger amount of time if the same algorithm is run on an explicit representation of the complement graph. Therefore, researchers have studied algorithms that perform standard graph computations on the complement of an input graph, using an implicit graph representation that does not require the explicit construction of the complement graph. In particular, it is possible to simulate either depth-first search or breadth-first search on the complement graph, in an amount of time that is linear in the size of the given graph, even when the complement graph may have a much larger size. It is also possible to use these simulations to compute other properties concerning the connectivity of the complement graph.

<text>The Northern Outfall Sewer (NOS) is a major gravity sewer which runs from Wick Lane in Hackney to the Beckton Sewage Treatment Works in east London. Most of it was designed by Joseph Bazalgette, as a result of an outbreak of cholera in 1853 and the &quot;Great Stink&quot; of 1858.

Prior to the work, drains in central London were built primarily to cope with rain water, but the growing use of flush toilets frequently meant that they became overloaded, causing sewage and industrial effluent to flow into the River Thames. Bazalgette&#x27;s London sewerage system project included the construction of intercepting sewers north and south of the Thames. The Southern Outfall Sewer network diverts flows away from the Thames south of the river.

In total, five interceptor sewers were constructed north of the Thames. Three were built by Bazalgette, and two were added 30 years later:
*The northernmost (Northern High Level Sewer) begins on Hampstead Hill and is routed past Kentish Town and Stoke Newington and under Victoria Park to the start of the Northern Outfall Sewer at Wick Lane.
*Two middle level sewers serve parts of central London and also join the Northern Outfall Sewer at Wick Lane:
**One begins close to Kilburn and runs along Edgware Road, Euston Road and past King&#x27;s Cross, through Islington to Wick Lane.
**The other runs from Kensal Green, under Bayswater and along Oxford Street, then via Clerkenwell and Bethnal Green to Wick Lane.
*Two low-level sewers stretch from west London:
**One starts from near Ravenscourt Park, passes under Hammersmith and Kensington, Piccadilly, the Strand, Aldwych, the City and Aldgate to Abbey Mills Sewage Pumping Station.
**The second begins in Hammersmith, crosses under Fulham and then runs along the King&#x27;s Road and Cheyne Walk from where it becomes an integral part of the Thames Embankment. Western Sewage Pumping Station near Chelsea Bridge helps maintain the necessary gravity flow, taking sewage on along Millbank, the Victoria Embankment and Tower Hill, then north-east under Whitechapel, Stepney and Bow to Abbey Mills.

The flows from the two low-level sewers are raised by some into the Northern Outfall Sewer at Abbey Mills Pumping Station, to join the flows from the High and Middle Level sewers.

The remaining sections of the NOS carry the sewage from Abbey Mills to the treatment plant at Beckton. The creation of the NOS was a massive undertaking, and involved the construction of huge embankments and several bridges.

Today, the eastern end of the Northern Outfall Sewer, running some from Wick Lane to Beckton, has been landscaped to form a public footpath/cycleway called The Greenway, with access points along its length.

<doc id="1175660" wikidata="Q1094376" url="?curid=1175660" title="Let's Get It On">
<text>Let&#x27;s Get It On is the twelfth studio album by the American soul singer and songwriter Marvin Gaye. It was released on August 28, 1973, by the Motown subsidiary label Tamla Records on LP.

Recording sessions for the album took place during June 1970 to July 1973 at Hitsville U.S.A. and Golden World Studio in Detroit, and at Hitsville West in Los Angeles. Serving as Gaye&#x27;s first venture into the funk genre, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; also incorporates smooth soul and doo-wop styles alongside sexually suggestive lyrics, leading to one writer&#x27;s description of it as &quot;one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded&quot;. Gaye infused ideas of spiritual healing in songs about sex and romance, in part as a way of coping with childhood abuses from his father Marvin Gay Sr., which had stunted his sexuality.

Following the breakthrough success of his socially conscious album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971), &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; helped establish Gaye as a sex icon and broadened his mainstream appeal. It produced three singles—the title track, &quot;Come Get to This&quot;, and &quot;You Sure Love to Ball&quot;—that achieved &quot;Billboard&quot; chart success. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; became the most commercially successful album of Gaye&#x27;s career at Motown, resulting in more creative control being given to him by the label. Its erotic balladry, multi-tracking of Gaye&#x27;s vocals, and seductive funk sound also influenced later R&amp;B recording artists and producers, with the title track specifically helping pioneer the slow jam and quiet storm formats.

In retrospect, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; has been regarded by writers and music critics as a landmark recording in soul. It increased the popularity of funk during the 1970s, while Gaye&#x27;s smooth-soul sound marked a change from his record label&#x27;s previous success with the &quot;Motown Sound&quot; formula. Among the most acclaimed LPs in history, it frequently appears on professional rankings of the greatest albums and has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame as a historically important recording. In 2001, it was reissued by Motown as a two-CD deluxe edition release. In 2023, the album was reissued with added material for its 50th anniversary.

== Background ==
In the spring of 1972, Marvin Gaye was suffering from writer&#x27;s block. Following the release of his most commercially successful album up to that point, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; (1971), and the soundtrack album to the blaxploitation film &quot;Trouble Man&quot; (1972), Gaye had struggled to come up with new material after Motown Records had renegotiated a new contract with him. The contract provided him with more creative control over his recordings. The deal was worth $1 million, making him the highest-earning soul artist, as well as the highest-earning black artist, at the time. He was also struggling with deciding whether or not to relocate to Los Angeles, following Motown-CEO Berry Gordy&#x27;s move of the record label and replacement of the Detroit-based Hitsville U.S.A. (Motown Studio A) recording studio with the Hitsville West studio in Los Angeles. Amid relocation and his lack of material, Gaye was struggling with his conscience, as well as dealing with expectations from his wife, Gordy&#x27;s sister Anna. Gaye&#x27;s separation from Gordy pressured him emotionally. During this time, he had also been attempting to cope with past issues that had stemmed from his childhood.

During his childhood, Gaye had been physically abused by his preacher father Marvin Gay Sr., who disciplined his son under extremely moralistic and fundamentalist Christian teachings. As a result, the meaning and practice of sex had later become a disturbing question for Gaye. As an adult, he suffered from impotence and became plagued by sadomasochistic fantasies, which haunted him in his dreams and provoked intense feelings of guilt. Gaye learned to cope with his personal issues with a newly found spirituality. He began incorporating his new outlook into his music, as initially expressed through the socially conscious album &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, along with promotional photos of him wearing a kufi in honor of African traditional religions and his faith.

By winning over record executives with the success of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, Gaye attained more creative control, which he would use, following his brief separation from wife Anna Gordy, to record an album that was meant to explore themes beyond sex. As with &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, Gaye wanted to have a deeper meaning than the general theme that was used to portray it; in the case of the former album, politics, and with its follow-up effort, love and romance, which would be used by Gaye as a metaphor for God&#x27;s love. In his book &quot;Divided Soul: The Life of Marvin Gaye&quot;, Gaye biographer David Ritz wrote of the singer&#x27;s inspiration behind &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;:

In the album&#x27;s liner notes, Gaye explained his views on the themes of sex and love, stating &quot;I can&#x27;t see anything wrong with sex between consenting anybodies. I think we make far too much of it. After all, one&#x27;s genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE. When combined, they work well together, if two people are of about the same mind. But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such. Time and space will not permit me to expound further, especially in the area of the psyche. I don&#x27;t believe in overly moralistic philosophies. Have your sex, it can be exciting, if you&#x27;re lucky. I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky.&quot;

== Recording ==
Gaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the Golden World Records studio, known as Motown&#x27;s Studio B, as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;. Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973. Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called The Funk Brothers, who had contributed to Gaye&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs &quot;The World is Rated X&quot; and &quot;Where Are We Going?&quot; and the single &quot;You&#x27;re the Man&quot; (1972) at Golden World. &quot;Where Are We Going?&quot; was later covered by trumpeter Donald Byrd. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled &quot;You&#x27;re the Man&quot;, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first recording, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, was composed by Gaye with friend and former Motown label mate Ed Townsend. It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life, but Motown singer-songwriter Kenneth Stover re-wrote it as a more political first draft. Upon hearing Gaye&#x27;s preliminary mix of Stover&#x27;s draft, Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones, particularly &quot;about making sweet love.&quot; Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song&#x27;s lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact. The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter, whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions. Townsend has cited Hunter&#x27;s presence during the album&#x27;s recording as an inspiration for Gaye. Gaye&#x27;s intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently became the basis for his 1976 album &quot;I Want You&quot;. While recording the title track, he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio.

Townsend assisted Gaye with producing the rest of the album, whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973. They worked on four songs together, including the ballad &quot;If I Should Die Tonight&quot;, while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. &quot;Just to Keep You Satisfied&quot; was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love. With re-recording the song, he had re-written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye, who happened to be the original song&#x27;s co-writer. The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye, with the exception of &quot;Just to Keep You Satisfied&quot;, which were done by The Originals. Most of the instrumentation for the album was done by members of The Funk Brothers, including bassist James Jamerson, guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, and percussionist Eddie &quot;Bongo&quot; Brown. Gaye also contributed on piano during the sessions.

== Music and lyrics ==
&quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; features soulful, passionate lead vocals and multi-tracked background singing, both by Gaye. It has a 1950s-styled melody and begins with three wah-wah guitar notes and centers on simple chord changes, while its arrangements are centered on an eccentric rhythm pattern. Its signature guitar line is played by session musician Don Peake. Music journalist Jon Landau dubs the song &quot;a classic Motown single, endlessly repeatable and always enjoyable&quot;. The song is reprised on the fourth track, &quot;Keep Gettin&#x27; It On&quot;. It expands on the title track&#x27;s sensual theme with political overtones: &quot;won&#x27;t you rather make love, children / as opposed to war, like you know you should.&quot;

The third track, the ballad &quot;If I Should Die Tonight&quot; originally appeared on the vinyl LP in a shortened version lasting only 3:03. For the 1986 &#x27;twofer&#x27; (with &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;) CD reissue of the album, Motown recording engineers for the first time restored the missing verse which had been omitted from the LP. The full length track, which has been used for all subsequent releases, runs to 4 full minutes.

&quot;Distant Lover&quot; has Gaye crooning over serene instrumentation, leading to soulful screams near the end; from a heartbroken croon to an impassioned wail. The song&#x27;s lyrics chronicled the yearning its narrator feels for a lover who is &quot;so many miles away&quot;, as he pleads for her return and laments the emptiness he feels without her. Music writer Donarld A. Guarisco later wrote of the song&#x27;s sound, in that &quot;Marvin Gaye&#x27;s studio recording enhances the dreamy style of the song with stately horn and strings, tumbling drum fills that gently nudge the song along, and mellow, doo wop-styled background vocals that echo &quot;love her, you love her&quot; under his romantic pleas. The song later became a concert favorite for Gaye and a live concert version, featuring female fans screaming in the background, was released as a single from his &quot;Marvin Gaye Live!&quot; album in 1974.

&quot;You Sure Love to Ball&quot; is one of Gaye&#x27;s most sexually overt and controversial singles, with its intro and outro featuring moaning sounds made by a man and woman engaged in sex. The sexually-explicit and risqué nature of the album&#x27;s content were, at the time, controversial, and the recording of such an album was deemed as a commercial risk by Motown A&amp;R&#x27;s (Artists and Repertoire) and label executives.

== Marketing and sales ==
Released on August 28, 1973, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; surpassed Gaye&#x27;s previous studio effort, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, as the best-selling record of his tenure with Motown. The album peaked at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, behind The Rolling Stones&#x27;s &quot;Goats Head Soup&quot; (1973), while it also managed to reach number one in &quot;Cash Box&quot; for one week, as well as two weeks at the top of &quot;Record World&quot;″s music charts. &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; charted for 61 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and remained at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul Albums for 11 weeks, becoming the best-selling soul album of 1973.

Two of the album&#x27;s singles reached the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;, which became Gaye&#x27;s second number-one US single, and the top-30 hit &quot;Come Get to This&quot;, which peaked at number 23 on the chart. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;You Sure Love to Ball&quot;, charted at number 50 on the Hot 100 and at number 13 on the Soul Singles chart.

Along with the album&#x27;s music and sexual content, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;″s commercial success and promotion helped establish Marvin Gaye as a sex icon, while helping further expand his artistic control during his tenure at Motown. This commercial success also led to a much publicized tour for Gaye to promote &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; and expand on his repertoire as a live performer. Successful concert performances of the album&#x27;s material helped Gaye gain an increasing popularity and fan base in the pop market, while earning him a reputation as one of the top live performers of the time. His performance at the Oakland Coliseum during the 1973-1974 tour was released on the 1974 LP &quot;Live!&quot;, which would serve as Gaye&#x27;s only release during his sabbatical period in the mid-1970s.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;fine in terms of vocal attack and material [...] touches on the excellent in terms of instrumental support&quot;, while citing the title track and &quot;Distant Lover&quot; as the album&#x27;s best recordings. Jon Landau of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found Gaye&#x27;s performance on-par with that of &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot; and wrote that &quot;he continues to transmit that same degree of intensity, sending out near cosmic overtones while eloquently phrasing the sometimes simplistic lyrics&quot;. Although he viewed that it &quot;lacks that album&#x27;s series of highpoints&quot;, Landau commented that &quot;it ebbs and flows, occasionally threatening to spend itself on an insufficiency of ideas, but always retrieved, just in time, by Gaye&#x27;s performance. From first note to last, he keeps pushing and shoving, and if he sometimes takes one step back for every two ahead, he gets there just the same — and with style and spirit to spare&quot;. In &quot;Creem&quot; magazine, Robert Christgau called the record &quot;post-Al Green &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, which means it&#x27;s about fucking rather than the human condition, thank the wholly holey&quot;.

Since its initial reception, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; has been viewed by writers as a milestone in soul music. In &quot;The Best Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Records of All Time&quot;, Jimmy Guterman writes that the album was &quot;a bit more conventional musically (soul crossing into mild funk) and much more focused lyrically than its predecessor, &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;&quot;. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writer Greg Kot commended Gaye for using &quot;the multi-tracked vocals perfected on ″&quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;″, this time to convey his most intimate desires&quot;, commenting that &quot;while the album is replete with erotic imagery, both implied and explicit, it is also as much preoccupied with distance and unfulfilled need&quot;. Jason Ankeny of Allmusic called it &quot;a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy&quot;, writing that &quot;Gaye&#x27;s passions reach their boiling point [...] With each performance laced with innuendo, each lyric a come-on, and each rhythm throbbing with lust, perhaps no other record has ever achieved the kind of sheer erotic force of &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot;&quot;. Ankeny also dubbed it &quot;one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded.&quot; Allmusic&#x27;s Lindsay Planer cites it as a &quot;hedonistic R&amp;B masterpiece.&quot; BBC Music&#x27;s Daryl Easlea found Gaye &quot;in supreme command of his material&quot;, and viewed it as &quot;much more than an album about simple lust&quot;, but an &quot;iconic, rapturous work&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
Much like &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; has been included in professional lists of the best albums. It was ranked number 58 on &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s 1993 publication of the 100 Best Albums of All Time. &quot;Blender&quot; magazine ranked the album number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time. In 2003, it was ranked number 165 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time publication; the 2020 edition of the list ranked it 422nd. Also in 2003, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; was reissued by Universal Music; the re-release was later given a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry. In 2004, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and cited by The Recording Academy as a recording of &quot;historical significance&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
Because of the album and its singles&#x27; initial sales and response, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; marked a change and transition in sound and production for Motown, which had previously enjoyed success with its trademark &quot;Motown Sound&quot;. The label&#x27;s well-known sound, however, was beginning to fade in popularity among the majority of R&amp;B and soul listeners, while experiencing commercial pressure from contemporary styles that incorporated more diverse elements, such as Philly soul and funk. The Motown sound was typified by characteristics such as the use of tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call and response singing style that originated in gospel music. In addition, pop production techniques were simpler than that of Gaye&#x27;s 1970s concept albums. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided by Motown musicians. Following his breakthrough with &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, an &quot;experiment in collating a pseudo-classical suite of free-flowing songs&quot;, Gaye used his artistic control to modify the sound and incorporate funky instrumentation, melismatic vocalization, and heavy vocal multi-tracking, in much contrast to the established production style at the label. In contrast to Motown&#x27;s previously successful process of emphasizing an artist&#x27;s single releases rather than their album, Gaye and fellow producer Ed Townsend followed a similar formula previously used on &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, in which the album&#x27;s songs flow together in a suite-form arrangement, opposing label CEO Berry Gordy&#x27;s strong emphasis on hit single success.

Gaye&#x27;s change of musical style and production with the album made an immediate impact on the subsequently successful Motown artists, including Lionel Richie and Rick James. The album&#x27;s vocal multi-tracking and instrumentation also influenced the development of contemporary R&amp;B and slow jams. Allmusic calls the album &quot;the blueprint for all of the slow jams to follow decades later — much copied, but never imitated.&quot; Renown engineer Russell Elevado&#x27;s work in the neo soul genre, including his production for D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s &quot;Voodoo&quot; (2000) and Erykah Badu&#x27;s &quot;Mama&#x27;s Gun&quot; (2000), has been influenced by Gaye&#x27;s and Townsend&#x27;s production techniques and sound.

The album&#x27;s sexual content pushed creative barriers in the recording industry and led to an increased popularity of sexual themes in contemporary music. Music writer Rob Bowman later cited &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; as &quot;one of the most erotic recordings known to mankind.&quot; The album&#x27;s success helped spark a series of similarly styled releases by such smooth soul artists as Barry White (&quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;), Smokey Robinson (&quot;A Quiet Storm&quot;) and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (&quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot;). The commercial success of such artists led to a change of trend from socially conscious aesthetics to more mainstream, sensually themed music. Gaye achieved further success with &quot;I Want You&quot; (1976), featuring more sexually explicit lyrics and expanded use of vocal multi-tracking, and with &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; (1978), which he based entirely on his tumultuous marriage to Anna Gordy. In an interview with music author Michael Eric Dyson, hip hop artist Q-Tip discussed the album&#x27;s influence and significance to its time period, stating:

Following the success of Sly and the Family Stone&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Riot Goin&#x27; On&quot; (1971) and James Brown&#x27;s late 1960s and early 1970s singles, Gaye&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; gave greater mainstream exposure to funk and broadened its influence on the music industry. Many later R&amp;B musicians, such as Prince, D&#x27;Angelo, and R. Kelly, were greatly influenced by its vintage sound and seductive themes, incorporating much of Gaye&#x27;s musical style into their music.

<text>David Mark Penney (born 17 August 1964) is an English football manager and former player. Born in Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, Penney entered professional football at the relatively late age of 21. He had been working as a bricklayer and playing for nothing at Pontefract Collieries for five years before he was spotted by Derby County scout Ron Jukes, who recommended him to manager Arthur Cox. He was offered a contract at the then Third Division club and they climbed two divisions before he left for Oxford United for £175,000. He then went on to Wales, where he played for Swansea City and Cardiff City, latterly signing for Doncaster Rovers in 1998. He played as a midfielder.

==Managerial career==
In 2002 Penney retired to pursue a career in management and he remained at Doncaster, taking the managerial job on a full-time basis. After a well-placed finish in his first season, Penney guided Doncaster back into the Football League with victory in the 2003 play-off final. Their stay in Division Three wasn&#x27;t long though as he managed Doncaster to the Division Three title. During a further two seasons of cementing Doncaster&#x27;s place in League One Penney famously masterminded victories over Premier League sides Manchester City and Aston Villa, and nearly overcame Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-finals before finally being beaten in a penalty shootout. Penney left Rovers on 30 August 2006 as he felt he had taken the club as far as he could.

He was appointed manager of Darlington on 30 October 2006. He returned to Doncaster with Darlington for a Football League Trophy tie on 9 January 2007, Doncaster winning the game 2–0, and Penney received a hero&#x27;s reception from the home fans at the new Keepmoat Stadium.

Penney was appointed manager at Oldham Athletic on 30 April 2009. He left on 6 May 2010, through mutual consent, with falling attendances one of the reasons why Penney was relieved of duty.

On 10 January 2011, Penney was appointed as manager of League One club Bristol Rovers. His tenure in charge of the west country club did not last long however, as he was sacked less than two months later having lost nine of his 13 games in charge. His last game was a 2–0 defeat against Dagenham and Redbridge. Following receiving the sack from Bristol Rovers, Stuart Campbell was put in charge for the game against Tranmere, in which a Chris Lines goal sealed a 1–0 win.

While at the Memorial Stadium, he only recorded two wins, against Swindon Town and Oldham Athletic, and also recorded a 6–1 defeat away to Walsall.
He was reported as being furious after being overlooked for the Grimsby Town managerial job when Rob Scott and Paul Hurst were appointed on 22 March 2011.

As of 13 May 2013, he is reported to be interested in a coaching role at Southend United, as newly appointed manager Phil Brown seeks to improve the quality of back-room staff at the club. He was hired as an assistant coach, leaving the position in June 2015. In September 2016, Penney was once again hired as an assistant manager, this time for Guiseley. Together with manager Adam Lockwood, Penney was fired on 30 August 2017.

On 1 October 2017, York City hired Penney as a sporting director.

On 11 August 2022, York City announced that Penney had left the club by mutual consent with immediate effect.

<doc id="1175666" wikidata="Q5141281" url="?curid=1175666" title="Cograph">
<text>In graph theory, a cograph, or complement-reducible graph, or &quot;P&quot;4-free graph, is a graph that can be generated from the single-vertex graph &quot;K&quot;1 by complementation and disjoint union. That is, the family of cographs is the smallest class of graphs that includes &quot;K&quot;1 and is closed under complementation and disjoint union.

Cographs have been discovered independently by several authors since the 1970s; early references include , , , and . They have also been called D*-graphs, hereditary Dacey graphs (after the related work of James C. Dacey Jr. on orthomodular lattices), and 2-parity graphs.
They have a simple structural decomposition involving disjoint union and complement graph operations that can be represented concisely by a labeled tree, and used algorithmically to efficiently solve many problems such as finding the maximum clique that are hard on more general graph classes.

Special cases of the cographs include the complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, cluster graphs, and threshold graphs. The cographs are, in turn, special cases of the distance-hereditary graphs, permutation graphs, comparability graphs, and perfect graphs.

== Definition ==

===Recursive construction===
Any cograph may be constructed using the following rules:
# any single-vertex graph is a cograph;
# if formula_1 is a cograph, so is its complement, formula_2;
# if formula_1 and formula_4 are cographs, so is their disjoint union, formula_5.
The cographs may be defined as the graphs that can be constructed using these operations, starting from the single-vertex graphs.
Alternatively, instead of using the complement operation, one can use the join operation, which
consists of forming the disjoint union formula_5 and then adding an edge between every pair of a vertex from formula_1 and a vertex from formula_4.

===Other characterizations===
Several alternative characterizations of cographs can be given. Among them:

* A cograph is a graph which does not contain the path &quot;P&quot;4 on 4 vertices (and hence of length 3) as an induced subgraph. That is, a graph is a cograph if and only if for any four vertices formula_9, if formula_10 and formula_11 are edges of the graph then at least one of formula_12 or formula_13 is also an edge.
* A cograph is a graph all of whose induced subgraphs have the property that any maximal clique intersects any maximal independent set in a single vertex.
* A cograph is a graph in which every nontrivial induced subgraph has at least two vertices with the same neighbourhoods.
* A cograph is a graph in which every connected induced subgraph has a disconnected complement.
* A cograph is a graph all of whose connected induced subgraphs have diameter at most 2.
* A cograph is a graph in which every connected component is a distance-hereditary graph with diameter at most 2.
* A cograph is a graph with clique-width at most 2.
* A cograph is a comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order.
* A cograph is a permutation graph of a separable permutation.
* A cograph is a graph all of whose minimal chordal completions are trivially perfect graphs.
* A cograph is a hereditarily well-colored graph, a graph such that every greedy coloring of every induced subgraph uses an optimal number of colors.
* A graph is a cograph if and only if every vertex order of the graph is a perfect order, since having no &quot;P&quot;4 means that no obstruction to a perfect order will exist in any vertex order.

== Cotrees ==

A cotree is a tree in which the internal nodes are labeled with the numbers 0 and 1. Every cotree &quot;T&quot; defines a cograph &quot;G&quot; having the leaves of &quot;T&quot; as vertices, and in which the subtree rooted at each node of &quot;T&quot; corresponds to the induced subgraph in &quot;G&quot; defined by the set of leaves descending from that node:
* A subtree consisting of a single leaf node corresponds to an induced subgraph with a single vertex.
* A subtree rooted at a node labeled 0 corresponds to the union of the subgraphs defined by the children of that node.
* A subtree rooted at a node labeled 1 corresponds to the &quot;join&quot; of the subgraphs defined by the children of that node; that is, we form the union and add an edge between every two vertices corresponding to leaves in different subtrees. Alternatively, the join of a set of graphs can be viewed as formed by complementing each graph, forming the union of the complements, and then complementing the resulting union.
An equivalent way of describing the cograph formed from a cotree is that two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if the lowest common ancestor of the corresponding leaves is labeled by 1. Conversely, every cograph can be represented in this way by a cotree. If we require the labels on any root-leaf path of this tree to alternate between 0 and 1, this representation is unique.

== Computational properties ==

Cographs may be recognized in linear time, and a cotree representation constructed, using modular decomposition, partition refinement, LexBFS , or split decomposition. Once a cotree representation has been constructed, many familiar graph problems may be solved via simple bottom-up calculations on the cotrees.

For instance, to find the maximum clique in a cograph, compute in bottom-up order the maximum clique in each subgraph represented by a subtree of the cotree. For a node labeled 0, the maximum clique is the maximum among the cliques computed for that node&#x27;s children. For a node labeled 1, the maximum clique is the union of the cliques computed for that node&#x27;s children, and has size equal to the sum of the children&#x27;s clique sizes. Thus, by alternately maximizing and summing values stored at each node of the cotree, we may compute the maximum clique size, and by alternately maximizing and taking unions, we may construct the maximum clique itself. Similar bottom-up tree computations allow the maximum independent set, vertex coloring number, maximum clique cover, and Hamiltonicity (that is the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle) to be computed in linear time from a cotree representation of a cograph. Because cographs have bounded clique-width, Courcelle&#x27;s theorem may be used to test any property in the monadic second-order logic of graphs (MSO1) on cographs in linear time.

The problem of testing whether a given graph is &quot;k&quot; vertices away and/or &quot;t&quot; edges away from a cograph is fixed-parameter tractable. Deciding if a graph can be &quot;k&quot;-edge-deleted to a cograph can be solved in O*(2.562&quot;k&quot;) time, and &quot;k&quot;-edge-edited to a cograph in O*(4.612&quot;k&quot;). If the largest induced cograph subgraph of a graph can be found by deleting &quot;k&quot; vertices from the graph, it can be found in O*(3.115&quot;k&quot;) time.

Two cographs are isomorphic if and only if their cotrees (in the canonical form with no two adjacent vertices with the same label) are isomorphic. Because of this equivalence, one can determine in linear time whether two cographs are isomorphic, by constructing their cotrees and applying a linear time isomorphism test for labeled trees.

If &quot;H&quot; is an induced subgraph of a cograph &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;H&quot; is itself a cograph; the cotree for &quot;H&quot; may be formed by removing some of the leaves from the cotree for &quot;G&quot; and then suppressing nodes that have only one child. It follows from Kruskal&#x27;s tree theorem that the relation of being an induced subgraph is a well-quasi-ordering on the cographs. Thus, if a subfamily of the cographs (such as the planar cographs) is closed under induced subgraph operations then it has a finite number of forbidden induced subgraphs. Computationally, this means that testing membership in such a subfamily may be performed in linear time, by using a bottom-up computation on the cotree of a given graph to test whether it contains any of these forbidden subgraphs. However, when the sizes of two cographs are both variable, testing whether one of them is an induced subgraph of the other is NP-complete.

Cographs play a key role in algorithms for recognizing read-once functions.

Some counting problems also become tractable when the input is restricted to be a cograph. For instance, there are polynomial-time algorithms to count the number of cliques or the number of maximum cliques in a cograph.

The number of connected cographs with &quot;n&quot; vertices, for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3, ..., is:
:1, 1, 2, 5, 12, 33, 90, 261, 766, 2312, 7068, 21965, 68954, ... 
For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1 there are the same number of disconnected cographs, because for every cograph exactly one of it or its complement graph is connected.

==Related graph families==

===Subclasses===
Every complete graph is a cograph, with a cotree consisting of a single 1-node and leaves. Similarly, every complete bipartite graph is a cograph. Its cotree is rooted at a 1-node which has two 0-node children, one with leaf children and one with leaf children.
A Turán graph may be formed by the join of a family of equal-sized independent sets; thus, it also is a cograph, with a cotree rooted at a 1-node that has a child 0-node for each independent set.

Every threshold graph is also a cograph. A threshold graph may be formed by repeatedly adding one vertex, either connected to all previous vertices or to none of them; each such operation is one of the disjoint union or join operations by which a cotree may be formed.
===Superclasses===
The characterization of cographs by the property that every clique and maximal independent set have a nonempty intersection is a stronger version of the defining property of strongly perfect graphs, in which there every induced subgraph contains an independent set that intersects all maximal cliques. In a cograph, every maximal independent set intersects all maximal cliques. Thus, every cograph is strongly perfect.

The fact that cographs are &quot;P&quot;4-free implies that they are perfectly orderable. In fact, every vertex order of a cograph is a perfect order which further implies that max clique finding and min colouring can be found in linear time with any greedy colouring and without the need for a cotree decomposition.

Every cograph is a distance-hereditary graph, meaning that every induced path in a cograph is a shortest path. The cographs may be characterized among the distance-hereditary graphs as having diameter at most two in each connected component.
Every cograph is also a comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order, obtained by replacing the disjoint union and join operations by which the cograph was constructed by disjoint union and ordinal sum operations on partial orders.
Because strongly perfect graphs, perfectly orderable graphs, distance-hereditary graphs, and comparability graphs are all perfect graphs, cographs are also perfect.

<text>Frederic Franklin (13 June 1914 – 4 May 2013), sometimes also called &quot;Freddie&quot;, was a British-American ballet dancer, choreographer and director.

==Dancer==

Born in Liverpool, England, Frederic Franklin claimed that on seeing the 1924 film &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, his only thought was to go on the stage. He began his career in 1931 at the Casino de Paris with Josephine Baker. In his time in England, Franklin performed with Wendy Toye and Anton Dolin in acts such as the cabaret, variety, concert ballet, vaudeville, and theater. After briefly dancing with the Vic-Wells Ballet, forerunner of The Royal Ballet, he joined the Markova-Dolin Ballet in 1935.

In 1938 Franklin joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo where he was premier danseur until 1952. Known as a quick study and for having an impeccable memory, Franklin also became the company&#x27;s ballet master in 1944. With the Ballet Russe, Franklin originated many indelible characters and starred in over 45 principal roles by such choreographers as Leonide Massine, Michel Fokine, Bronislava Nijinska, Frederick Ashton, George Balanchine, and Agnes de Mille.

In 1949, Franklin went on a concert tour in South Africa. Throughout his time there, he performed ballets such as the Nutcracker and the Mirage. Upon returning to the states and creating his own Ballet with Mia Slavenska, they performed programs such as Swan Lake and A Streetcar Named Desire. In addition, the Slavenska-Franklin Ballet had the opportunity to go to Japan. In Japan, Franklin was able to bring together Swan Lake with the help of Japanese children. However, the Slavenska-Franklin Ballet had begun to experience extreme financial difficulties. As a result, in 1955, Franklin returned to the city and was able to rejoin the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo&#x27;s 1957 season was extremely special because it was the 20-year anniversary as well as Franklin&#x27;s last show with them. After, Franklin briefly taught at the Ballet of Monte Carlo School on Madison Ave.

While performing internationally with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Franklin and Alexandra Danilova created one of the legendary ballet partnerships of the twentieth century. Among the other ballerinas he partnered were Alicia Markova, Yvette Chauviré, Moira Shearer, Rosella Hightower, Maria Tallchief, Tamara Toumanova, and Alicia Alonso. In addition, he performed roles such as the Baron in &quot;Gaite Parisienne&quot;, the Baron in &quot;Night Shadow (La Sonnambula)&quot;, and the Champion Roper in &quot;Rodeo.&quot;

In the 1950s, Franklin also gained experienced when he went to Puerto Rico after a call from Juan Anduze. Upon his return to the states in 1962, he went to Washington D.C, where he joined the National Ballet as founding director, and stayed with them for 12 years. On the opening night of National Ballet of Washington, D.C. following his return, there were 100 musicians of the National Symphony Orchestra, an abundance of magazine and news crews, and choreographer George Balanchine also came to watch.

==Director and choreographer==
In 1952, Franklin co-founded the Slavenska-Franklin Ballet with Mia Slavenska and a few years later he became the co-director of the Washington Ballet, and then the co-founder and artistic director of the National Ballet of Washington, D.C.

In his lifetime, Franklin choreographed three pieces. In 1958, he created his first ever piece for the Washington Ballet called Etalage. His second piece is called Homage Au Ballet which was also for the Washington Ballet in 1963. His final piece is called The Tribute which was for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1962. According to an interview Franklin had done, he best choreographs by visualizing the dancers and their movements in his head.

After a few years in Washington, D.C., Franklin began a freelance career reviving and staging works around the United States and developed artistic associations with many ballet companies including Cincinnati Ballet where he was artistic director for two years and later Director Emeritus, Dance Theatre of Harlem where he became artistic advisor in 1989, Chicago Ballet, Tulsa Ballet, the Oakland Ballet, Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, and American Ballet Theatre.

In 2005, Franklin was featured in the documentary film &quot;Ballets Russes&quot;, recounting his years with the famous company. Into his 90s, Franklin continued to perform with American Ballet Theatre, appearing in mime roles such as the Friar in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Madge in &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, and the Prince&#x27;s Tutor in &quot;Swan Lake&quot;.
Franklin died from pneumonia in New York City at the Weill Cornell Medical Center on 4 May 2013. He was survived by his partner of 48 years, William Haywood Ausman, and his brother, John Franklin.

== Awards ==
In 1984, Frederic Franklin was honored with a Laurence Olivier Award for his staging of a Creole-themed Giselle starring Virginia Johnson at Dance Theatre of Harlem. Franklin received the Dance Magazine Award in 1985 and the Capezio Dance Award in 1992. On 16 November 2004 Franklin was appointed a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. In 2011, Franklin was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame.

<text>Boris Živković (; born 15 November 1975) is a Croatian former professional footballer who played as a full-back and centre-back.

Živković began his professional career with Marsonia and Hrvatski Dragovoljac in his native country before spending six seasons with Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen. Following shorter stints at Portsmouth, VfB Stuttgart, and 1. FC Köln, he returned to Croatia to play for Hajduk Split.

At international level, Živković represented the Croatia national team making 39 appearances, 18 of which as the captain of the team.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Živković started his career at Sarajevo as a youth player, before being signed by Marsonia (from Slavonski Brod). He gained a good reputation at Marsonia, first appearing in the 1994–95 season, during which he made 13 appearances. The next season, he played a further 31 games before transferring to Hrvatski Dragovoljac (from Siget, Zagreb). He only spent one season at his new club however, before impressive performances persuaded German club Bayer Leverkusen to sign him.

===Bayer Leverkusen===
Živković went on to play six seasons for the German club, playing over 150 times, including the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final. Following his contract expiring in the summer of 2003, Živković stated his desire to play in the Premier League, and was signed later that summer by Portsmouth.

===Portsmouth and Stuttgart===
Živković started his Pompey career well, instantly claiming a regular starting place. However, in December, a public fall-out with manager Harry Redknapp led to him being released, having played only 18 times for the club. VfB Stuttgart stepped in to bring Živković back to Germany, and the Croatian joined them in January.

===Hajduk Split===
In August 2006 he moved to Hajduk Split.

==International career==
Živković was a regular for the Croatia national team, making 39 appearances and scoring twice. He was part of the squad at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but in his first game against Mexico, he caused a penalty in the 59th minute after which he was sent off and the Mexicans went on to score from the penalty mark and win the game by 1-0. He was no longer in the team for the remaining two games Croatia played on the tournament before being eliminated — Italy and Mexico progressed from the group to the playoffs instead.

He also played two games at Euro 2004. Boris was out of favour for the Zlatko Kranjčar&#x27;s World Cup 2006 campaign but many defender injuries forced Slaven Bilić to give him a call for the Euro 2008 spring qualifying games.

<text>The United Country Party was a minor political party in the United Kingdom during the late 1970s. The party was among those against immigration, inflation and the excesses of the Winter of Discontent, claiming to represent &quot;people with common sense&quot;.

The party was formed by Edmund Iremonger, a member of the Conservative Party and The Freedom Association; noted amateur astronomer and television personality Patrick Moore was party chairman.

The party arose out of the perceived weakness of James Callaghan and right wing frustration at Edward Heath&#x27;s leadership of the Conservative Party. &quot;Though expressing admiration for Mrs Thatcher, the party was wary of the rest of the Conservative Party.&quot;

For the 1979 general election, they stood two of the 2575 candidates who received 1,033 votes in total. These were for seats in adjoining southern counties of Surrey and West Sussex, R. Peel for Farnham and Iremonger for Chichester, the seat in which Moore also lived. Both lost their deposit which was a small sum of £150 and its retention required 12.5% of the vote until the reforms of a statute brought into effect in 1985.

It was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980.

<doc id="1175677" wikidata="Q914440" url="?curid=1175677" title="Here, My Dear">
<text>Here, My Dear is the fourteenth studio album by the American soul singer and songwriter Marvin Gaye, released as a double album on December 15, 1978, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place between 1977 and 1978 at Gaye&#x27;s personal studios, Marvin Gaye Studios, in Los Angeles, California. The album was notable for its subject matter focusing largely on Gaye&#x27;s acrimonious divorce from his first wife, Anna Gordy Gaye.

A commercial and critical failure upon its release, it was later hailed by music critics, in the years following Gaye&#x27;s death, as one of Gaye&#x27;s best albums. &quot;It&#x27;s taken me a while,&quot; Anna admitted in later years, &quot;but I&#x27;ve come to appreciate every form of Marvin&#x27;s music.&quot;

==Background==

Marvin Gaye was going through a personal crisis in the summer of 1976. In November 1975, Gaye&#x27;s estranged first wife, Anna Gordy Gaye, sued Gaye for divorce, claiming irreconcilable differences, and sought child support for their adopted son, Marvin Gaye III. Gaye later argued his spending habits were causing him to fall behind on payments. In September 1976, a warrant was issued for Gaye&#x27;s arrest after he failed to pay alimony; this made him feel vulnerable during the recording sessions, causing the singer to hide from the public for several days.

Several weeks later, Gaye accepted an offer to do a tour of Europe. Between October and December 1976, Gaye performed in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Germany. Following his return, he recorded &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; and released it on his album, &quot;Live at the London Palladium&quot;. The song became an international hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

After months of delays, in March 1977, the singer&#x27;s attorney, Curtis Shaw, wanted to end divorce proceedings and convinced Gaye to give up half of the percentage of album royalties he would earn from his next Motown album to Anna. The Gayes&#x27; divorce was finalized later that month.

==Recording==
When Gaye was set to start production on the record, he said he figured he would just do a &quot;quickie record - nothing heavy, nothing even good&quot;, stating, &quot;Why should I break my neck when Anna was going to wind up with the money anyway?&quot; But as Gaye lived with the notion of doing an album for his soon-to-be ex-wife, the more it fascinated him, stating he felt he &quot;owed the public my best effort.&quot; Gaye stated he did the record &quot;out of deep passion&quot;, noting he &quot;sang and sang until I drained myself of everything I&#x27;d lived through.&quot;

Shortly after the deal was made, Gaye entered his recording studio on March 24, 1977, to record the album with only engineer Art Stewart by his side. Gaye, who usually did not write his lyrics, composed on the spot, mumbling over prerecorded tracks or to his own accompaniment. The mumblings were &quot;embryonic melodies&quot;, which eventually evolved into lyrics after three or four takes. Gaye ended up playing all the keyboard parts of the album, saying later, &quot;I didn&#x27;t plan it that way. It just turned out to be a hands-on project.&quot;

==Music==
According to &quot;PopMatters&quot; journalist Mike Joseph, &quot;Here, My Dear&quot;″s music was &quot;largely midtempo funk, with elements of traditional soul, gospel, and doo-wop mixed together with a slight hint of disco&quot;. The title track opens the album, and in the album&#x27;s liner notes David Ritz describes Gaye&#x27;s tone in the song as &quot;self-serving, self-justifying [and] self-pitying&quot;. &quot;I Met a Little Girl&quot; includes doo-wop drenched harmonies with its lyrics and music producing a &quot;thick mixture&quot; of sincerity and sarcasm. Considered the central melodic motif of the album, &quot;When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You&quot; abandoned traditional song structure with a discursive mode, without a chorus, with its lyrics expressing &quot;different feelings - tenderness, fear, anger, regret&quot;. Described as &quot;straight ahead and beguiling&quot; compared to all the other songs on the album, &quot;Anger&quot; is considered as &quot;part sermon and part self-retribution&quot;, describing his movement from catharsis to escape.

&quot;Is That Enough?&quot; was recorded shortly after Gaye returned from a day in divorce court, humming the song&#x27;s melody and some lyrics. Much like some other songs, it&#x27;s told in a storyteller&#x27;s point of view. &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot; is described as an &quot;attempt to empathy&quot;. &quot;Time to Get It Together&quot; includes a confessional that was influenced by Stevie Wonder&#x27;s song, &quot;As&quot;. &quot;Anna&#x27;s Song&quot; is described as &quot;the very heart&quot; of the album. &quot;A Funky Space Reincarnation&quot; alluded to &quot;Star Wars&quot; as well as the music of George Clinton&#x27;s Parliament-Funkadelic. &quot;You Can Leave, But It&#x27;s Going to Cost You&quot; is produced under an assertive tone describing an argument between Marvin and his wife over his girlfriend, Janis. The final track, &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot;, is dedicated to Janis, in which Gaye concluded on a &quot;regenerative note&quot;.

An AllMusic reviewer later wrote of the music:

==Artwork==
The front cover featured a painting of Gaye dressed in a toga in a neo-Roman setting, created by artist Michael Bryan, who stated Gaye described how he wanted to be depicted on the cover. The back cover features a temple with the word &quot;matrimony&quot; collapsing around a mock-Rodin sculpture of a romantic couple. The fold-out illustration inside the original double album shows a man&#x27;s hand reaching across to the hand of a woman&#x27;s, about to give her a record. The hands are extended on a Monopoly board—with the legend JUDGMENT written on it. On the man&#x27;s side are tape recorders and a grand piano; on the woman&#x27;s are a house, car and ring. The scales of justice sit above the game while, from arched windows, curious observers watch. David Ritz described the juxtaposition of images reflected Gaye&#x27;s turbulent state of mind at the time.

==Release and reception==

When &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; was released in the end of 1978, it received mostly positive reviews and modest sales, with critics calling the album &quot;bizarre&quot; and &quot;un-commercial.&quot; The album&#x27;s lack of success angered Gaye to the point that he refused to promote it any further. Motown stopped promoting &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; in early 1979, by which point Gaye had gone into self-imposed exile. Around the same time, Gaye&#x27;s relationship with his second wife, Janis, had also fallen apart and the couple separated sometime in 1979. Upon hearing the album, a visibly upset Anna Gordy considered suing Gaye for invasion of privacy but, according to &quot;People&quot;, later reconsidered that decision. The album peaked at number four R&amp;B and number 26 pop, becoming Gaye&#x27;s lowest-charting studio album of the 1970s. Initial response to the album was mixed, as most critics described it as weird. However, Gaye&#x27;s lyrical honesty over the laid back disco grooves of &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; was praised by many. Robert Christgau, of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, wrote of the album:

The &quot;Bay State Banner&quot; noted that &quot;Gaye really did a fine job of arranging the horn charts, keeping them actively involved without dominating or clashing.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that much of the album &quot;is simply brilliant,&quot; and wrote that &quot;it is an inventory of the whole expressive range of black popular music at the end of the 70&#x27;s, a testing of limits, and an affirmation of musical values.&quot;

===Retrospect===
The album was re-evaluated in the years following its original release, and is today seen as a landmark in Gaye&#x27;s career.

In 1994, the album was re-released due to increased attention on Gaye&#x27;s life to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the singer&#x27;s death, and reached number-one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s R&amp;B catalog chart.

&quot;Here, My Dear&quot; was voted one of the greatest albums in music history by &quot;Mojo&quot; (1995). The album has appeared on all three editions of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, at #462 in 2003, #456 in 2012, and #493 in 2020.

On February 15, 2008, Hip-O Select reissued &quot;Here, My Dear&quot; as a two-disc &quot;Expanded Edition&quot; including a song cut from the original album, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Funny How Things Turn Around&quot;, which was remixed by funk legend Bootsy Collins. Disc two featured remastered and alternate versions of the songs from the album remixed by contemporary soul producers such as Salaam Remi, Questlove, Prince Paul, DJ Smash, Mocean Worker, and others.

&quot;It doesn&#x27;t quite get you the first time,&quot; Jay Kay told &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;And a lot of the songs are quite similarly paced. It&#x27;s almost like the same song being subtly changed ten different ways. A lot of it, lyrically, is about the break-up of his relationship. There&#x27;s a track called &#x27;Anger&#x27;, which is lyrically really brilliant; and there&#x27;s a track called &#x27;Time To Get It Together&#x27; using, I think, a marimba, and it&#x27;s just dreamy and lovely. He was a deep man at the time, but I think the charlie was eating him up. It&#x27;s all about struggling and fighting, and you can feel it.&quot;

<doc id="1175680" wikidata="Q3622449" url="?curid=1175680" title="Argo 16">
<text>Argo 16 was the codename of an Italian Air Force C-47 Dakota aircraft, registration MM61832, used by 306th Group of the &quot;Flight Department of the General Staff&quot; (RVSM, then 31st Wing) of the Italian Air Force.

== Crash ==
On November 23, 1973, Argo 16 crashed near Porto Marghera shortly after taking off from Venice Airport, killing the crew, Colonel Anano Borreo, Lieutenant Colonel Mario Grande, Engineer Aldo Schiavone and Radio Operator Francesco Bernardini. The plane crashed into a building belonging to the Data Processing Center of the Montedison oil complex, with the wreckage hitting the parking lot, the research center and the administrative offices of Montefibre, but without causing any further casualties. 

Shortly after boarding the plane and before taking off, SID lieutenant Giuseppe Cismondi received a radio communication ordering the plane to head toward the NATO base in Aviano. Cismondi was then forced to disembark from the plane. Argo 16 then took off for Aviano, but after a few minutes the latter crashed into the Montefibre factory in Porto Marghera. 

== Usage ==
Admiral Fulvio Martini declared during a hearing at the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry on terrorism in Italy that the code name of the plane &quot;Argo 16&quot;, was named for the giant mythological all-seeing Argus Panoptes. The aeroplane conducted electronic observation missions in the Adriatic Sea for the Secret Service against the Yugoslavian radar network. According to Luigi, Borreo`s father, the commander of the crew of the Argo 16, Anano Borreo, feared for his life: he was aware that his work placed him at the centre of delicate and dangerous situations. 

Some journalistic sources claimed that the plane with registration MM61832 was also used by Gladio for the transport of men to the Centro Addestramento Guastatori, a training base located in Capo Marrargiu, Sardinia, and for the transport of NASCO weapons to secret depots of the &quot;gladiators&quot;. 

The plane was also used to accompany a group of Arab terrorists back to Tripoli who were blocked on 5 September 1973 while they were preparing to launch a missile from a terrace in Ostia at an Israeli airline jet. 

=== Retaliation thesis for the &quot;lodo Moro&quot; ===
The liberation of the Arabs was requested by the PLO headed by Yasser Arafat, in exchange for that release the PLO would do its utmost not to carry out any other act of terrorism on Italian soil, with a temporary commitment made directly with the Foreign Minister in the context of the so-called &quot;patto Moro&quot; or &quot;lodo Moro.&quot;

According to information given during a hearing filed with the Italian Senate on January 20, 2009, the existence of this pact with its validity of over a decade was confirmed by Bassam Abu Sharif, the &quot;historical&quot; leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, by the lawyer Giovanni Pellegrino, by the senator Francesco Cossiga and by the judge Rosario Priore (who was the investigator of the proceedings relating to the kidnapping of Aldo Moro).

Although it is a fact that Italian foreign policy under the regency of Aldo Moro at the Farnesina followed a more pro-Arab direction, the timing of the replacement of the &quot;&quot;lodo De Gasperi&quot; &quot; with the &quot;&quot;lodo Moro&quot; &quot;, in relations with the world of Middle Eastern intelligence, does not fully match the story of the end of the Argo 16 plane. Since many sources place the commitment undertaken by Moro following the Fiumicino massacre (1973), it would not have been possible to react in November to an event that had yet to happen; therefore, other sources maintain that the commitment was decided before, and that it was only &quot;stipulated&quot; formally after the 1973 Fiumicino massacre.

== Causes ==
In 1999 the Corte d&#x27;assise of the Venice Tribunal declared that the cause had to be attributed to an accident, effectively excluding any intervention by the Mossad, but other theories on the causes of the accident have also been put forward without however providing concrete and adequate evidence.

During an episode of an Italian television program aired in 1990 and focused on the Argo 16 case, General Geraldo Serravalle, head of Gladio from 1971 to 1974, declared that although there is a widespread opinion that the cause was sabotage by the Israeli secret services, it was probable that the explosion was caused by the gladiators themselves who refused to hand over their weapons. Giovanni Pellegrino, former president of the italian commissione stragi, was of the same opinion and believed that the cause should be sought based on the use made of the plane by Gladio.

In 2000 General Gianadelio Maletti (SID) stated during an interview with a journalist of the italian newspaper &quot;la Repubblica&quot; that the plane was returning from Libya after having released five palestinians involved in a failed attack in Ostia and arrested and that an &quot;unfortunate stop&quot; in Malta officially confirmed to the israeli secret services what was happening. He also declared that he had been contacted by Asa Leven the then head of the israeli secret services station in Rome before that operation and that he was aware of the italian government&#x27;s intentions he proposed to collaborate to kidnap the five and extradite them to Jerusalem but he said &quot;nothing will be done&quot; and &quot;argo 16 crashes&quot;.

== Trial ==
In March 1997, Italian judge Carlo Mastelloni incriminated 22 Italian Air Force officers on charges of suppression, falsification and subtraction of documents concerning state security. In his opinion, in fact, &quot;those who over the years have been involved in the investigation have systematically concealed, falsified or destroyed every element that could lead to the right path&quot;. Among those accused of the massacre were Zvi Zamir, former head of the Mossad, and Asa Leven, former head of the Mossad in Italy.

Finally, 9 officers, officials and consultants of the SID and SISMI were sent to trial. The Italian Public prosecutor Remo Smitti asked for an eight-year sentence for Maletti, Viezzer and Lehmann, an acquittal for all the others and an acquittal for Zvi Zamir, considered by Mastelloni to be the instigator of the sabotage. The defense lawyers managed to dismantle all the charges and on December 16, 1999 the judges concluded the trial by establishing that the plane crashed due to a failure or pilot error.

<text>Frank Stallone Jr. (born July 30, 1950) is an American actor and musician. He is the younger brother of actor and filmmaker Sylvester Stallone and has written music for Sylvester&#x27;s movies. His song &quot;Far from Over&quot; appeared in the 1983 film &quot;Staying Alive&quot; and was included in the film&#x27;s soundtrack album. The song reached number ten on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and received a Golden Globe nomination for Stallone, while the album itself, consisting of Stallone and various other artists, received a Grammy nomination.

==Early life==
Stallone was born in Maryland and grew up in Philadelphia. He is the younger son of Jacqueline Stallone (née Labofish; 1921–2020), an astrologer, former dancer, and promoter of women&#x27;s professional wrestling, and Frank Stallone Sr. (1919–2011). His father was an Italian immigrant, and his mother&#x27;s family was French from Brittany. In his teen years, he went to Lincoln High School in Northeast Philadelphia.

==Career==

===1980s to 1990s===
Stallone has worked as a singer. He wrote and performed &quot;Far from Over&quot; for the 1983 film &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, which was written and directed by his older brother. The song peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming his only major pop hit, and it was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song from a Motion Picture. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special. Stallone also had a minor acting role in &quot;Staying Alive&quot;.

Stallone also played himself in a recurring role on the short-lived sitcom &quot;Movie Stars&quot;, alongside fellow celebrity siblings Don Swayze and Joey Travolta.

Stallone was the subject of repeated non-sequitur punchlines delivered by comedian Norm Macdonald during the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment of the television show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. On Instagram, Stallone said he enjoyed the jokes and expressed regret that they were never able to work together before Macdonald&#x27;s death from leukemia.

===2000s and 2010s===
Stallone appeared as a boxing consultant on the NBC reality television series &quot;The Contender&quot; in 2005. He appeared on the Howard Stern radio show on several occasions. During one 1992 appearance on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Stallone had a boxing match with television reporter Geraldo Rivera; Stallone won the bout. He was a contestant on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot;, a reality competition series on CMT that followed ten celebrity contestants as they trained to be professional wrestlers. He also appeared on an episode of &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;.

On August 17, 2010, the Australian comedy duo Hamish &amp; Andy flew Stallone, then aged 60, to Australia for a one-night-only gig called &quot;Hamish &amp; Andy present: Frank Stallone “Let me be Frank with you” The Fully Franked Tour&#x27;&quot;. Following a parade in Melbourne, Stallone performed &quot;Far from Over&quot; to an audience of over 2,000 people. Hamish &amp; Andy were big fans of the song, claiming it always pumped them up, and they dubbed the phenomenon &quot;The Frank Effect&quot;. Stallone said of the night, &quot;This is seriously one of the best, &quot;best&quot; times I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

A documentary directed and produced by Derek Wayne Johnson entitled &quot;Stallone: Frank, That Is&quot; about the life, career, and survival of Frank Stallone was released in 2021. The documentary features interviews with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Billy Zane, Geraldo Rivera, Joe Mantegna and many others.

<text>St. Mary of the Angels is a former Roman Catholic church in Everton, Liverpool, built in 1907. It has a magnificent altar of marble, imported to bring Rome to Liverpool. The building of the church was funded by Amy Elizabeth Imrie, a Catholic convert and nun, who became an abbess of the Poor Clare Sisters. She was the heiress to the White Star Line shipping fortune when her uncle, William Imrie, died in 1906.

The church is a Grade II Listed Building; its interiors are also listed. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool shut the church in Fox Street in 2001 and has stated that the church will never be reopened. The Archdiocese was prevented by Liverpool City Council in 2002 from stripping the church&#x27;s Italian High Renaissance-style interior fixtures and fittings.

The Church was rented out to the Whitechapel Centre (a charity supporting the homeless in Liverpool) until 2005 and since 2006 has become a rehearsal space for the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic orchestra, which rebranded the building as &quot;The Friary&quot;. It is not accessible to the public.

<text>The yellow-shouldered amazon (Amazona barbadensis), also known as the yellow-shouldered parrot, is a parrot of the genus &quot;Amazona&quot; that is found in the arid areas of northern Venezuela, the Venezuelan islands of Margarita and La Blanquilla, and the island of Bonaire (Caribbean Netherlands). It has been extirpated from and reintroduced to Aruba and introduced to Curaçao.

== Taxonomy ==
The yellow-shouldered amazon was described and illustrated in 1738 by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin in his &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot; based on live specimen. Albin believed that the parrot had come from Barbados and used the English name, the &quot;Barbadoes parrot&quot;. Using Albin&#x27;s account, both Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 and John Latham in 1781 included a description of the parrot in their books on birds. When in 1788 the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, he included the yellow-shouldered amazon, coined the binomial name &quot;Psittacus barbadensis&quot; and cited Latham&#x27;s work. Gmelin specified the type locality as Barbados but this parrot species is not found on the island and Venezuela is the type locality. The yellow-shouldered amazon is now placed with around thirty other species in the genus &quot;Amazona&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist René Lesson in 1830. The genus name is a Latinized version of the name &quot;Amazone&quot; given to these parrot in the 18th century by the Comte de Buffon, who believed they were native to Amazonian jungles. The specific &quot;barbadensis&quot; denotes Barbados. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The yellow-shouldered amazon is mainly green and about 33 cm long (~13 inches). It has a whitish forehead and lores, and a yellow crown, ocular region and - often - ear coverts and chin. The bare eye-ring is white. The thighs and the bend of the wing (&quot;shoulder&quot;) are yellow, but both can be difficult to see. The throat, cheeks and belly often have a bluish tinge. As most members of the genus &quot;Amazona&quot;, it has broad dark blue tips to the remiges and a red wing-speculum.

The yellow-shouldered amazon can be distinguished from the very similar orange-winged amazon by the latter&#x27;s lack of yellow on its shoulders and blue colouration around the eyes. Another way of distinguishing it from other &quot;Amazona&quot; species is its somewhat higher pitched vocalizations.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;A. barbadensis&quot; is endemic to northern Venezuela, Bonaire (which may have less than 400 birds), and other islands in the area. On the Venezuelan island of Margarita, it is extirpated from the east side, which is heavily commercialized and a popular tourist destination, existing only on the Macanao Peninsula. Also native to Aruba, it went locally extinct by 1947. In January of 2024, a population of over two dozen of these birds was reintroduced to the island and is doing well. An introduced population exists on Curaçao. Unlike other &quot;Amazona&quot; members, it is typically found in arid habitats, such as desert scrub and dry forests.

==Behavior==
===Food and feeding===
It feeds on fruits, seeds, and flowers, frequently consuming parts of cactus plants. The parrot is able to survive with minimal water, getting a large amount of moisture from their diet. This is especially clear on La Blanquilla, a small island with no natural bodies of water. The cacti that they so often eat are filled with liquid, in both the stems and fruits, and this keeps them alive in their arid environment.

===Breeding===
The yellow-shouldered amazon typically nests in holes in trees, cliffs, or cacti, and lays 2-5 eggs. Total clutch size and hatching success of this species on Margarita Island are among the highest documented for the genus &quot;Amazona&quot;, suggesting a high reproductive potential for the species It is highly gregarious, and can sometimes roost in communally in tall trees, forming groups of as many as 700. The population on Bonaire appears to breed slower than is typical for the species, bringing it in line with other members of the genus.

==Status==
Declines in several main land populations have been extensively documented, there are believed to be 2,500–10,000 yellow-shouldered amazons in the wild.

Due to ongoing habitat lost, small population size, limited range and overhunting for the pet trade, the yellow-shouldered amazon is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. On La Blanquilla, the main issues are predation by feral cats and hunting by local fishermen and Naval personnel. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES. Thanks to local surveillance by the Venezuelan NGO Provita, poaching has been significantly lowered in certain areas.

The population on the Caribbean island of Margarita had been as low as 750 birds in 1989, but thanks to conservation efforts, there were an estimated 2,400 by 2002, although different estimates describe just 2,000 in 2015. These efforts involved, among other things, the breeding and releasing of captive individuals, which was done with much success in the 1990s.

<text>Albert Szirmai (sometimes credited as Albert Sirmay) (2 July 1880 –15 January 1967) was a Hungarian operetta composer and music editor. Szirmai was a graduate of the Budapest Academy of Music, studying piano and composition (with Hans Koessler). Szirmai received a doctorate in music from the University of Budapest, and was devoted to creating works for the stage. He wrote music for 12 one-act plays and over 300 songs for the Budapest theater Népszínház-Vígopera, at which he was musical director. When his first operetta, &quot;The Yellow Domino&quot;, met with success, he decided to continue in the genre; it is due to the works of Szirmai, Emmerich Kálmán, and Victor Jacobi, among others, that the Hungarian operetta gained recognition internationally at the beginning of the 20th century.

Szirmai was born in Budapest. On September 3, 1923, he arrived in New York City aboard the  and took a post as music director for Chappell Music (a publishing house now owned by Warner Music Group). He was music editor for such Broadway luminaries as Jerome Kern, Cole Porter, Richard Rodgers and George Gershwin, and for a collection of the British duo Gilbert and Sullivan. Szirmai made headlines in 1965, when he discovered 100 unpublished songs Porter had written from 1924 to 1955, in Porter&#x27;s nine room apartment in the Waldorf Towers shortly after Porter&#x27;s death. &quot;I would call the material a rich musical heritage,&quot; Szirmai told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;There is enough material for one or two Broadway musical scores. There are dozens of excellent songs.&quot; Though he lived in America for most of his later years and was a good friend of Gershwin, Szirmai eschewed the jazz styles popular at the time; in addition to the folk music of his native Hungary, his music shows the influence of German Romanticism, particularly Felix Mendelssohn and Robert Schumann, whom he most admired. He died in New York.

<doc id="1175744" wikidata="Q1352401" url="?curid=1175744" title="Bombardment of Kagoshima">
<text>The Bombardment of Kagoshima, also known as the , was a military engagement fought between Britain and the Satsuma Domain in Kagoshima from 15 to 17 August 1863. The British were attempting to extract compensation and legal justice from &quot;daimyo&quot; Shimazu Tadayoshi for the 1862 Namamugi incident. 

The engagement began when a Royal Navy fleet commanded by Sir Augustus Leopold Kuper was fired on from Satsuma coastal batteries near Kagoshima. The British retaliated by bombarding the city, but were unable to gain a conclusive victory and retreated two days later. The Satsuma declared victory and, after negotiations, fulfilled some British demands regarding the Namamugi incident.

==Background==

On 14 September 1862, a confrontation occurred in Japan between a British merchant, Charles Lennox Richardson, and the entourage of Shimazu Hisamitsu, father and regent of Satsuma &quot;daimyo&quot; Shimazu Tadayoshi. After Richardson ignored warnings to stay out of the entourage&#x27;s way while travelling on a road near Kawasaki, Kanagawa, he was killed by Hisamitsu&#x27;s retainers under the traditional &quot;Kiri-sute gomen&quot; right, which allowed samurai to kill anyone in a lower social class for perceived disrespect. Richardson&#x27;s murder sparked outrage from Westerners in Japan due to its violation of the extraterritoriality they enjoyed under terms of the &quot;unequal treaties&quot;. 

Edward St. John Neale, the British chargé d&#x27;affaires, demanded from the &quot;Bakufu&quot; (the central government of the Tokugawa shogunate) an apology and indemnity of £100,000 as reparations for Richardson&#x27;s murder; the sum demanded by Neale represented roughly a third of the annual revenues of the &quot;Bakufu&quot;. Neale also threatened to the Japanese capital of Edo with a naval bombardment if the indemnity was not paid, and further demanded that the Satsuma Domain arrest and place on trial the perpetrators of Richardson&#x27;s murder, along with £25,000 compensation for the surviving victims of the incident and the relatives of Richardson. 

At the time, the &quot;Bakufu&quot; was led by Ogasawara Nagamichi, governing in the absence of &quot;Shogun&quot; Tokugawa Iemochi, who was then in Kyoto. Eager to resolve the dispute over Richardson&#x27;s murder, Ogasawara entered into a negotiation with France and Great Britain on 2 July 1863 onboard the French Navy warship &quot;Sémiramis&quot;. The European participants in the negotiations were Neale, Gustave Duchesne de Bellecourt, Benjamin Jaurès and Sir Augustus Leopold Kuper. Ogasawara issued an apology for the murder and paid the indemnity demanded by Neale. 

However, the Satsuma Domain refused to comply with Neale&#x27;s demands for an apology, £25,000 in compensation and placing the two samurai responsible for Richardson&#x27;s murder on trial, arguing that disrespect to the daimyo was typically sanctioned by the death of the offending parties. Legally, their argument was invalid, as Westerners in Japan were exempted from Japanese laws and customs due to extraterritoriality due to various treaties signed between the &quot;Bakufu&quot; and Western powers since the beginning of the &quot;Bakumatsu&quot; period.

Several violent confrontations between Westerners and the Japanese had already occurred throughout the country during this period, spurred on by Emperor Kōmei&#x27;s 1863 &quot;Order to expel barbarians&quot;. The Kanmon Straits had witnessed several attacks on American, Dutch and French merchant ships, which prompted punitive expeditions by these countries, with U.S. Navy frigate USS &quot;Wyoming&quot;, Dutch Navy warship &quot;Medusa&quot;, and French Navy warships &quot;Tancrède&quot; and &quot;Dupleix&quot; launching attacks on Japanese positions.

===Further negotiations===

Following protracted and fruitless negotiations with the Satsuma Domain that had taken over a year, Neale eventually had had enough. Under instructions from his superiors in the British government, he ordered Kuper to use military action to compel Satsuma into complying with his demands. After being informed of the British plans, the &quot;Bakufu&quot; asked for a delay in its implementation:

On the 5th, a &quot;Bakufu&quot; vice-minister from Edo visited Neale, but far from further opposing the planned British expedition against the Satsuma Domain, actually informed Neale that the Tokugawa shogunate intended to send one of its warships to join forces with Kuper&#x27;s squadron. The steamer in question, however, ultimately did not join the expedition.

===British departure===

Kuper&#x27;s Royal Navy squadron left Yokohama on August 6. It was composed of the flagship HMS &quot;Euryalus&quot; (with Neale on board), HMS &quot;Pearl&quot;, HMS &quot;Perseus&quot;, HMS &quot;Argus&quot;, HMS &quot;Coquette&quot;, HMS &quot;Racehorse&quot; and the gunboat HMS &quot;Havock&quot;. They sailed for Kagoshima and anchored in the deep waters of Kinko Bay on August 11. Satsuma Domain envoys came aboard &quot;Euryalus,&quot; and letters were exchanged, with Kuper pressing for a resolution satisfactory to his demands within 24 hours. The Satsuma Domain prevaricated, refusing to comply for various reasons.

==Bombardment==

After Kuper&#x27;s deadline expired without a satisfactory conclusion to his demands, he decided to proceed with the plans to punish the Satsuma Domain. His squadron weighed anchor and proceeded to seize three British-built merchant steamers lying at anchor in Kagoshima harbour which were owned by the Satsuma Domain: the &quot;Sir George Grey&quot;, &quot;Contest&quot; and &quot;England&quot;, with the ships having an aggregate value of £200,000. Kuper intended to use the three seized merchantmen as a bargaining chip in any future negotiations. 

In response, the Satsuma Domain&#x27;s military forces responded by waiting until a typhoon started before launching an artillery bombardment from their coastal batteries towards the British (the city had been evacuated prior to the engagement). Surprised by the hostility, Kuper&#x27;s squadron responded by confiscating as much valuable materiel as possible from the three captured steamers before setting them on fire. 

The British then spent approximately two hours readying their ships for battle (as they had not expected to enter into a military confrontation) before forming a line of battle, which sailed along the Kagoshima coast and fired a combination of shells and round shot towards the coastal batteries. Artillery fire from the &quot;Havoc&quot; set five Ryukyuan trading junks, which were not involved in the engagement, on fire. The Satsuma coastal batteries were slowly silenced by the British, though the fact that Kuper&#x27;s squadron was not expecting protracted resistance meant his ships slowly ran low on supplies and ammunition, and eventually he gave the order to retreat. The engagement resulted in 5 killed on the Satsuma side and 13 killed and 69 wounded on the British side, including Captain Josling of the &quot;Euryalus&quot; and his second-in-command Commander Wilmot, both decapitated by the same cannonball.

Additionally, roughly 500 &quot;Minka&quot; houses in Kagoshima, making up approximately 5% of the city&#x27;s urban area, was destroyed by the bombardment, along with the Ryukyuan embassy. The British retreat was face-saving for the Satsuma Domain, who claimed the engagement as a victory by taking into account the relative number of casualties. Kuper&#x27;s squadron did not land marines nor seize cannons from the coastal batteries (which would have signalled a clear British victory), Kuper having decided that the bombardment was enough.

==Aftermath==


Satsuma eventually decided to give in to Neale&#x27;s demands and paid £25,000 to the British (which they borrowed from the &quot;Bakufu&quot; and never repaid due to the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1869 and its replacement by the Meiji government). They never identified nor placed on trial Richardson&#x27;s killers, but despite this, the reparation received was enough for Britain to sign a treaty with the Satsuma Domain to supply the latter with steam warships. Ironically, the conflict became the starting point of a friendly relationship between the Satsuma Domain and Britain, which became major allies in the ensuing Boshin War. From the start, the Satsuma Province had generally been in favour of the opening and westernization of Japan.

<text>Gabbeh or gabba () carpets are a traditional variety of Persian carpet. Gabbeh is known as gava in Kurdish and Luri and is also called khersak () in Bakhtiari, literally meaning a &quot;bear&#x27;s cub&quot;. Traditionally a sleeping rug, a gabbeh is a hand-woven pile rug of coarse quality and medium size (90 x 150 cm, 3 by 5 ft, or larger) characterized by an abstract design that relies upon open fields of color and a playfulness with geometry. This type of rug is popular among the populations of the Zagros Mountains of Iran, including Kurdish, Luri and Qashqai people. The gabbeh is usually crafted by women.

Gabbeh carpets are much thicker and coarser than other Persian carpets; sometimes they can be as much as one inch or 2.5 cm in depth. In fact, they are more a variety of kilim than carpet. The word &quot;gabbeh&quot; comes from the Persian , meaning raw, natural, uncut. This is a rough and primitive carpet.

Gabbeh patterns are of a very basic kind with only a limited number of decorative, mostly rectangular objects resembling mainly animals. In gabbeh usually bright colors, such as yellow and red, are used. Although large fields of solid color are used in gabbeh designs, the color is variegated (the color varies throughout the rug, with the appearance of differently colored zones).

Gabbehs are made of natural, handspun wool yarn and all the colors are created with natural plant dye. Due to its relative ease of production (less precise pattern, small number of knots per square centimeter, etc.) a gabbeh is one of the less expensive varieties of Persian carpet.

In the 1980s, after the Iranian artist Parviz Tanavoli had experimented with vegetally dyed gabbehs, Gholamreza Zollanvari began producing the rugs in larger quantities, employing Qashgayi and Luri weavers. Increased production by the Zollanvari family, including their introduction of new patterns, exerted considerable influence on European rug markets.

<text>Warsaw Fortress (, ) was a system of fortifications built in Warsaw, Poland during the 19th century when the city was part of the Russian Empire. The fortress belonged to a chain of fortresses built in Congress Poland and the region adjacent to it during this period. It was built in stages, with the first part, known as Warsaw Citadel, built the years 1832-1834, in the immediate aftermath of the November Uprising of 1830. This initial fortification was then continually improved by the addition of further forts in its vicinity, with the work finally completed in 1874. In 1879 the government of the Russian Empire decided to carry out a major expansion of the fortress, which would incorporate a system of large forts surrounding the whole city. 20 forts forming this new system were constructed between 1883 and 1890. There were plans to combine the Warsaw fortress with the nearby Modlin Fortress by building a chain of connecting forts, but this work was carried out only partially. The rapid progress in the power of siege artillery required the forts to be continually strengthened. In the final period of its existence the fortress consisted of 29 forts and major works, including the older forts of the original Citadel, which were reinforced by numerous smaller fieldworks.

As a result of the defeat in the war with Japan in 1904-1905, the Russian Empire carried out a major rethinking of its military strategy. As part of this reevaluation and the resulting changes in strategic deployments, it was decided that maintaining the Warsaw Fortress was no longer cost-effective. In 1909 the decision was made to abolish the fortress. Work started out to demolish its works but it proceeded slowly. In 1913, with the worsening international situation immediately before the outbreak of the First World War, the decision was reversed, and hasty work started to return the fortress to combat readiness. These defenses were never put to the test, as Warsaw was evacuated by the Russian army without a fight in August, 1915, during its general retreat that summer.

After Poland regained its independence in 1918 the dismantling of some fortifications resumed, others were taken over by the Polish Army and used as storage sites or barracks, though over the years these were gradually abandoned. Some forts were briefly prepared for defense during the Battle of Warsaw in 1920, others saw heavy fighting during the siege of the city in September, 1939 though their defensive strength was vastly reduced due to advances in military technology. Today many of the forts are still in existence, but some were built over and no trace of them remains. At present the city lacks a unified concept for their use, though their historical value is recognized. They are mostly not maintained and hence not open to the public for sightseeing. Only the Citadel and some of its adjacent forts are well maintained and open to tourists.

<text>Sambo is a combat sport, and a recognized style of amateur wrestling governed by the UWW in the World Wrestling Championships along with Greco-Roman wrestling and freestyle wrestling. Practiced worldwide, sambo is a martial art with Soviet origins. Many of its moves have been incorporated in other forms of combat sport such as mixed martial arts.

== Etymology ==
It originated in the Russian SFSR of the Soviet Union during the 1920s. The word &quot;sambo&quot; is an acronym of (), which literally translates to &#x27;self-defence without weapons&#x27;.

SAMBO is a martial art and combat sport developed and used by the Soviet Red Army in the early 1920s to improve their hand-to-hand combat abilities. The sport incorporates various styles of wrestling and other self-defence systems such as kick-boxing and fencing.

Soviet martial arts expert Vasili Oshchepkov is credited as one of the founding fathers. Viktor Spiridonov, a military officer with background in several different styles of wrestling spanning across Soviet Union, is also considered an important founding member of SAMBO. 

Spiridonov and Oshchepkov independently developed two different styles, which eventually cross-pollinated and became what is known as SAMBO.

== Origins ==
Sambo is relatively modern since its development began in the early 1920s by the Red Army and other forces to improve hand-to-hand combat abilities of their servicemen. It was intended to merge the most effective techniques of other martial arts.

The pioneers of sambo were Viktor Spiridonov and Vasili Oshchepkov. Both were trained military men with access to frequent state sponsored travels opportunities where they were able to experience various local wrestling styles and add new techniques to their arsenal. Oshchepkov even spent several years living in Japan and training in Judo under its founder Kano Jigoro. Oshchepkov died in prison as a result of the Great Purge after being accused of being a Japanese spy, and judo was banned in the USSR for decades until the 1964 Olympics, where Sambists won four bronze medals.

Spiridonov and Oshchepkov independently developed two different styles, which eventually cross-pollinated and became what is known as sambo. Both men were trained military officers with backgrounds in several styles of combat wrestling that were prevalent in different regions of Russian Empire (later Soviet Union) and abroad. Combining these styles together the popular international style of Catch As Catch Can wrestling (known as &quot;Free wrestling&quot; in Russian at the time) and Japanese Judo wrestling, their respective styles gradually morphed into a new style of wrestling that was more suitable for the Soviet military&#x27;s hand-to-hand combat needs.

Compared to Oshchepkov&#x27;s system of &quot;free wrestling&quot; in Russia, Spiridonov&#x27;s style was softer, less brutal, and less strength-dependent, which in large part was due to injuries Spiridonov sustained during World War I.

Anatoly Kharlampiev, a student of Vasili Oshchepkov, is also considered a founder of sambo. On 16th of November 1938, it was recognized as an official sport when the USSR All-Union Sports Committee issued resolution no. 633.

== Styles ==
There are multiple competitive sport variations of sambo (though sambo techniques and principles can be applied to many other combat sports). Below are the main formats that are recognized by FIAS.
=== Sport Sambo ===
Sport sambo or Sambo wrestling () is stylistically similar to pre-WW1 Catch wrestling and Judo; and in a lot of ways influenced by them in rules and protocols. The competition uniforms (called &quot;kurtka&quot;) mimic clothing that was used wrestling tournaments popular amongst peasantry of Caucasus region in the Soviet Union, with few added elements from Judo wrestling outfits prevalent at the time. The competition colors (red and blue), shoes and circular ring have direct lineages from internationally popular style of Catch wrestling. Sambo also allows various types of leg locks while not allowing chokeholds, akin to rulesets that were widely used in pre-WW1 Catch wrestling tournaments. Similarly to its parent styles, it also places emphasis on throwing, ground control, riding, pinning and escapes as well as submissions, with very few restrictions on gripping and holds. 

Sambo is an international style of amateur wrestling recognized by the FILA (now UWW) Congress in 1966.

=== Combat Sambo ===

Combat sambo (). Used and developed for the military, combat sambo resembles modern mixed martial arts, including forms of striking and wrestling. Combat sambo allows regular punches, kicks, elbows, and knees, as well as soccer kicks, headbutts and groin strikes, in addition to throws, holds, chokes and locks, except for a standing or flying wristbar. The chief distinction from Sambo wrestling is that striking techniques are fully allowed. In terms of aliveness, combat sambo surpasses ARB by design, though both were designed for combat situations only. 

Competitors wear jackets as in sport sambo, but also hand protection and sometimes shin protection and headgear. 

The first FIAS World Combat Sambo Championships were held in 2001. The World Combat Sambo Federation, based in Russia, also sanctions international combat sambo events. Combat sambo is designed to tackle certain tasks. The effectiveness of this martial art determined by its structure, namely by three components: boxing, sambo, and adapters. Adapters of combat sambo were developed by the academician G. S. Popov. The task of adapters is to ensure the safe transition from middle distance to close one, as well as the consistent usage of sambo and boxing techniques. The given configuration provides the fusion of two martial arts into a single system.

Women participated in Combat Sambo for the first time in an official tournament in the Paris Grand Prix 2015. The first recognized instance of women competing in an international combat Sambo tournament was in the 2022 Asian and Oceania Sambo Championships. In 2022, Australia and New Zealand competed for the first time in the Asian sambo championship.

=== Freestyle Sambo ===

This type of Sambo was introduced by the American Sambo Association in 2004. Its purpose was to encourage non-Sambo practitioners such as Judo and Jiu-Jitsu to participate in Sambo. Freestyle Sambo allows the use of chokeholds and other submission techniques that are not used in Sambo wrestling.

=== FCF-MMA ===

This was developed in 2003 as a form of Sambo without competing in the traditional uniform of Kurtka (jacket), shorts and boots. Competitors just wear fight shorts and gloves. One competitor wears blue and the other red, the same as traditional Sambo. Matches are held on a traditional wrestling mat, not in a cage or ring like normal MMA fights. Techniques from all martial arts are used to defeat an opponent by knock out, submission or point victory.

=== Self-Defence Sambo ===

This kind of Sambo is about defending oneself. In it, practitioners are taught to guard against weapons. Most of the moves that are taught include using the attacker&#x27;s aggression against them, which is similar to what is done in both Jiu-Jitsu and Aikido. Spiridonov&#x27;s influence is strong in this style of Sambo.

=== Concrete Sambo ===

This type of Sambo was made for the Argentinian Army during the military dictatorship. It is similar to special sambo in terms of origin and uses.

=== Special Sambo ===

This type of Sambo was made for Army Special Forces and other rapid response forces. It is only designed for the particular group that uses it. In that sense, it&#x27;s similar to sambo combat, which is also designed for a specific purpose.

=== Beach Sambo ===

Sambo beach, as the name suggests, is held on soft beaches or strips of sand.

== History ==

=== Origins and influences ===
Vasili Oschepkov was one of the first foreigners to learn Judo in Japan and had earned his Nidan (second-degree black belt, out of then five) from judo&#x27;s founder, Kano Jigoro. Spiridonov&#x27;s background involved indigenous martial arts from various Soviet regions as well as an interest in Japanese jujutsu (though he never formally trained it). His reliance on movement over strength was in part because during World War I, he received a bayonet wound which would leave his left arm lame. Both Oschepkov and Spiridonov independently hoped that Soviet military hand-to-hand combat techniques could be improved with an infusion of the techniques distilled from other foreign martial arts. Contrary to common lore, Oschepkov and Spiridonov did not cooperate on the development of their hand-to-hand systems. Rather, their independent notions of hand-to-hand combat merged through cross-training between students and formulating efforts by their students and military staff. While Oschepkov and Spiridonov did have occasion to collaborate, their efforts were not completely united.

Each technique was carefully dissected and considered for its merits, and if found acceptable in unarmed combat, refined to reach sambo&#x27;s ultimate goal: to stop an armed or unarmed adversary in the least time possible. Thus, many techniques from jujutsu, judo, and other martial systems joined with the indigenous fighting styles to form the sambo repertoire. When the techniques were perfected, they were woven into sambo applications for personal self-defence, police, crowd control, border guards, secret police, dignitary protection, psychiatric hospital staff, military, and commandos.

=== Development ===

In 1918, Lenin created Vsevobuch (General Military Training) under the leadership of N. I. Podvoyskiy to train the Red Army. The task of developing and organizing Red Army military hand-to-hand combat training fell to K. Voroshilov, who in turn, created the NKVD physical training centre, Dynamo Sports Society.

Spiridonov was a combat veteran of World War I and one of the first wrestling and self-defence instructors hired for Dynamo. His background included Free wrestling (i.e. Catch wrestling), Graeco-Roman wrestling, many Turkic folk wrestling styles, and Japanese jujutsu. As a combative investigator for Dynamo, he travelled to Mongolia and China to observe their native fighting styles.

In 1923, Oschepkov and Spiridinov collaborated (independently) with a team of other experts on a grant from the Soviet government to improve the Red Army&#x27;s hand-to-hand combat system. Spiridonov had envisioned integrating the most practical aspects of the world&#x27;s fighting systems into one comprehensive style that could adapt to any threat. Oschepkov had observed Kano Jigoro&#x27;s distillation of Tenjin Shinyo Ryu, Kito Ryu and Fusen-ryū jujutsu into judo, and he had developed the insight required to evaluate and integrate combative techniques into a new system. Their developments were supplemented by Anatoly Kharlampiyev and I. V. Vasiliev who also travelled the globe to study the native fighting arts of the world. Ten years in the making, their catalogue of techniques was instrumental in formulating the early framework of the art to be eventually referred to as sambo.

Kharlampiyev is often called the &quot;father of sambo&quot;. This may be more legend than fact, since only he had the longevity and political connections to remain with the art while the new system was named &quot;sambo&quot;. However, Kharlampiyev&#x27;s political manoeuvring is single-handedly responsible for the USSR Committee of Sport&#x27;s accepting sambo as the official combat sport of the Soviet Union in 1938 – decidedly the &quot;birth&quot; of sambo. So, more accurately, Kharlampiyev could be considered the father of &quot;sport&quot; sambo.

Spiridonov was the first to begin referring to the new system with a name similar to &#x27;sambo&#x27;. He eventually developed a softer style called Samoz that could be used by smaller, weaker practitioners or even wounded soldiers and secret agents. Spiridonov&#x27;s inspiration to develop &#x27;Samoz&#x27; stemmed from his World War I bayonet injury, which greatly restricted his left arm and thus his ability to practise wrestling. Refined versions of sambo are still used today or fused with specific sambo applications to meet the needs of Russian commandos.

=== Running up to an Olympic sport status ===

After being recognized by FILA (known since September 2014 as United World Wrestling) in 1968, by the U.S. National Amateur Athletic Union in 1972, and after being included to the programme of the 1973 World Wrestling Championships along with Graeco-Roman and Freestyle wrestling (which are indeed Olympic sports,) Sambo was rapidly making its way to become an Olympic sport.

The first World Cup was contested in 1969. Don Curtis, a member of the U.S. Olympic Wrestling Committee, had predicted in 1975, that the Russians would introduce Sambo wrestling in the 1980 Olympics programme in Moscow. In 1975 the first United States National Sambo Championships were held in Mesa, Arizona, in 1977. It was contested along with G.R. and Freestyle at the first Pan American Wrestling Championships in Mexico City, and included in the schedule of the upcoming 1983 U.S. Olympic Festival and the 1983 Pan American Games (the 1983 Pan American event in Caracas became the first and subsequently the last edition of Sambo at the Pan Am Games.) In 1979 the National AAU Sambo Committee established several annual awards to honour outstanding persons in the sport of Sambo wrestling. By the 1980s it has been included to Pan American Games, National Sports Festival and AAU Junior Olympics programme.

But as a result of political complications of the 1980 Olympic boycott which arose after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Sambo was at first reduced to a demonstration sport at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, USSR. But later, because of the sport&#x27;s strong association with the Soviet Union, it was removed from demonstration sport status. It is true that youth sambo was demonstrated in the Games&#x27; opening ceremonies; however, sambo was never formally recognized as a demonstration sport. This common error in history books is noted in several sources including &quot;From SAMOZ to SAMBO&quot; by Anatoly Makovetskii and Lukashev&#x27;s &quot;History of Hand-to-Hand Combat in the First Half of the 20th Century: Founders and Authors&quot;. Furthermore, the official documents of the 1980 Olympic Organizing Committee do not mention sambo as a participating sport in the Games. Nevertheless, Jerry Matsumoto, Head of the U.S. Sambo Association, saw in 1990 Sambo becoming an Olympic sport, at least at the demonstration level, within the next eight years.

=== Today ===

In 1968, FILA accepted sambo as the third style of international wrestling. In 1985, the sambo community formed its own organization, Federation International Amateur Sambo (FIAS). In 1993, FIAS split into two organizations, both of which used the same name and logo, and the two groups were often referred to as FIAS &quot;East&quot; (under Russian control) and FIAS &quot;West&quot; (under US and Western European control). This split mirrored the last days of Cold War politics of the time as well as the recent break-up of the Soviet Union. In the U.S., disagreements between the sport&#x27;s organizers and the rise of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in the 1990s slowed down the growth of sambo before the success of several sambo fighters increased its popularity a decade later. In 2005, FILA reached an agreement with FIAS &quot;West&quot; and re-assumed sanctioning over sport sambo. However, in 2008, FILA again discontinued sanctioning sambo and sambo is now notably missing from the UWW website. At present, only FIAS sanctions international competition in sport sambo. In 2014 FIAS and FILA signed a cooperative agreement. While this does not place sambo back on UWW&#x27;s recognized list, it does move towards unity and prevents future &#x27;turf wars&#x27; regarding the sport&#x27;s promotion. A similar agreement was signed by FIAS and the International Judo Federation in 2014 as well. Both FIAS and the World Combat Sambo Federation host international combat sambo competition. The American Sambo Association has continued to host freestyle sambo tournaments in the US and Canada since 2004. These events are unrecognized by UWW.
Rumours rising in 2012 stating that sambo will be included as a demonstration sport in the 2016 Olympics are therefore not supported by any facts, and thus sambo is still a very long way from maturing into an Olympic sport, notwithstanding the effort that is being put into the matter. Indeed, given the intention of the Olympic Committee to remove classic wrestling from the Olympic roster, there are rumours that sambo is highly unlikely to ever make it to the Olympics. However, sambo has been included in the 27th Annual Summer Universiade for the first time in history. FIAS submitted an application to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to consider sambo for the 2020 Games and has devoted 2010–2013 to creating a sambo commission in the International Sports Press Association (AIPS). As of 30 November 2018, sambo has indeed received temporary recognition by the IOC. This close relationship is reestablishing the global popularity and media emphasis on sambo.

== Uniform and ranking ==
Similar to wrestling, a sambo practitioner normally wears either a red or a blue competition outfit. The kurtka (), also called a sambovka (), similar to the keikogi in style and function, although it is tighter fitting and has epaulettes and belt loops. as well as shoulder straps, wrestling-style shorts, and special protective shoes called Bortsovki and match the uniform&#x27;s colour. The sambo uniform does not reflect rank or competitive rating. Sport rules require an athlete to have both red and blue sets to visually distinguish competitors on the mat.

Also similar to the wrestling ranking system used in Russia, a competitive rating system is used (rather than the belt colour ranking system used in judo and gendai jujutsu). Various sport organizations distribute these ranks for high levels of competition achievement or in some cases coaching merits. People who have earned these ranks are known as &#x27;Masters of Sport.&#x27; Institutions that grant a sambo &#x27;Master of Sport&#x27; in Russia include FIAS, FKE, and the International Combat Sambo Federation. Other nations have governing bodies that award &#x27;Masters of Sport&#x27; as well, including the American Sambo Association in the United States. 

== Competitions ==

=== FIAS World SAMBO Championships ===


=== FIAS World Cup ===
Sambo World Cup and Supercup have been contested since 1969, initially held by FILA, and since 1985 by FIAS.

=== United States National Sambo Championships ===
United States National Sambo Championships known initially as the National AAU Sambo Wrestling Championships are the annual championships held in the United States. American enthusiasts of martial arts took up Sambo shortly before it was contested at the 1973 World Wrestling Championships and was rapidly making its way to become an Olympic sport in 1980.


=== Sambo at the National Wrestling Championships ===

The national Sambo competition also was held along with Graeco-Roman and Freestyle events at the 1987 and 1988 AAU/USA Grand National Wrestling Championships on July 1, 1987, and July 6, 1988, respectively, both held at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana. The next year it was contested at the 1989 AAU/Carrier Grand National Wrestling Championships on July 5 at Metra in Billings, Montana. 1990 AAU Grand National Wrestling Championships also hosted a national Sambo competition at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana, on July 10. 1992 AAU Grand National edition hosted a national Sambo competition in July in Amarillo, Texas. 1994 AAU Grand National Wrestling Championships also hosted a national Sambo competition at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek, Michigan, on July 13. 1995 AAU Grand National edition hosted a national Sambo competition in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The 1999 AAU Grand National Wrestling Championships also offered Sambo to competitors on June 30 at Metra in Billings, Montana. The 2002 AAU Grand National Wrestling Championships saw Sambo competition on June 19 at Hirsch Coliseum in Shreveport, Louisiana.

USA Wrestling has added Sambo as a style since the 2007 U.S. National Wrestling Championships in Las Vegas, Nevada.

== Notable practitioners ==
== Name controversy ==

Although sambo is a Russian acronym, exponents of the sport in the English-speaking world have faced problems concerning the linguistically unrelated racist term. Sambo representatives worldwide have opted to use the alternative spelling &quot;Sombo&quot; to avoid offence. However, FIAS still references the sport with its acronym spelling: SAMBO.

<doc id="1175761" wikidata="Q626225" url="?curid=1175761" title="Teamwork">
<text>Teamwork is the collaborative effort of a group to achieve a common goal or to complete a task in an effective and efficient way. Teamwork is seen within the framework of a team, which is a group of interdependent individuals who work together towards a common goal.

The key characteristics of a team include a shared goal, interdependence, boundedness, stability, the ability to manage their own work and internal process, and operate in a bigger social system.

Teams need to be able to leverage resources to be productive (i.e. playing fields or meeting spaces, scheduled times for planning, guidance from coaches or supervisors, support from the organization, etc.), and clearly defined roles within the team in order for everyone to have a clear purpose. Teamwork is present in contexts including an industrial organization (formal work teams), athletics (sports teams), a school (classmates working on a project), and the healthcare system (operating room teams). In each of these settings, the level of teamwork and interdependence can vary from low (e.g. golf, track and field), to intermediate (e.g. baseball, football), to high (e.g. basketball, soccer), depending on the amount of communication, interaction, and collaboration present between team members.

Among the requirements for effective teamwork are an adequate team size. The context is important, and team sizes can vary depending upon the objective. A team must include at least two members, and most teams range in size from two to 100. Sports teams generally have fixed sizes based upon set rules, and work teams may change in size depending upon the phase and complexity of the objective.

== History ==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the use of &quot;team-work&quot; in the context of a team of draught animals as early as 1800.

Even though collaborative work among groups of individuals is very prominent today, that was not the case over half a century ago. The shift from the typical assembly line to organizational models that contained increasing amounts of teamwork first came about during World War I and World War II, in an effort for countries to unite their people. The movement towards teamwork was mostly due to the Hawthorne studies, a set of studies conducted in the 1920s and 1930s that suggested positive aspects of teamwork in an organizational setting. After organizations recognized the value of teamwork and the positive effects it had on companies, entire fields of work shifted from the typical assembly line to the contemporary High Performance Organizational Model.

==Effective teamwork characteristics==
A team must have certain interrelated characteristics to work effectively.

Among these is strong group cohesion. There is a positive relationship between group cohesion and performance.

Communication is another vital characteristic for effective teamwork. Members must be able to effectively communicate with each other to overcome obstacles, resolve conflict, and avoid confusion. Communication increases cohesion.

Communication helps to clearly define the team&#x27;s purpose so that there is a common goal. Having a common goal increases cohesion because all members are striving for the same objective and will help each other achieve their goals.

Commitment occurs when members are focused on achieving the team&#x27;s common goal.

Accountability is necessary to ensure milestones are reached and that all members are participating. Holding members accountable increases commitment within team relations.

==Basic team dynamics==
Basic team dynamics include:
* Open communication to avoid conflicts.
* Effective coordination to avoid confusion and the overstepping of boundaries.
* Efficient cooperation to perform the tasks in a timely manner and produce the required results, especially in the form of workload sharing.
* High levels of interdependence to maintain trust, risk-taking, and performance.
These teamwork conditions lead to the team turning in a finished product. To measure if the teamwork was effective, the organization must examine the quality of the output, the process, and the members&#x27; experience. The teamwork can be deemed efficient if the output met or exceeded the organization&#x27;s standard, the process the team chose to take helped them reach their goals, and the members report high levels of satisfaction with the team members as well as the processes that the team followed.

== Processes ==

Teams perform various processes during different periods of time. The processes can be performed when the team is undertaking specific activities, when the team is changing from one activity to the next, and during both periods of change and action when addressing relationships between the team members. Teamwork processes fall into three categories:

===Transition processes===
These processes occur between periods of action. Team members can evaluate their overall performance as a team and on an individual level, give feedback to each other, make clarifications about the upcoming tasks, and make any changes that would improve the process of collaborating.
* Task Analysis
* Goal Specification
* Strategy Formulation
* Result oriented group

===Action processes===
These processes take place when the team takes steps to accomplish its goals and objectives. Team members keep each other informed about their progress and their responsibilities, while helping one another with tasks. Feedback and collaborative work continues in high levels throughout this process.
* Monitoring progress toward goals
* Systems Monitoring
* Team Monitoring and Backup Behavior
* Coordination

===Interpersonal processes===
These processes are present in both action periods and transition periods, and occur between team members. This is a continuous process, in which team members communicate thoughts and/or feelings concerning either another team member or a manner in which a task is being performed. Furthermore, team members encourage and support each other on their individual tasks.
* Conflict management
* Motivation and Confidence building
* Affect Management
Teamwork performance generally improves when a team passes through these processes, since processes like these enhance coordination and communication between the team members and therefore increase teamwork and collaborative work.

== Training to improve teamwork ==
Teamwork and performance can be enhanced through specific training that targets individual team members and the team as a whole. Bruce Tuckman proposed a team developmental model that separated the stages of a team&#x27;s lifespan and the level of teamwork for each stage:
# Forming
#* This stage is described by approach/avoidance issues, as well as internal conflicts about being independent vs. wanting to be a part of the team.
#* Team members usually tend to &#x27;play it safe&#x27; and minimize their risk-taking in case something goes wrong.
#* Teamwork in this stage is at its lowest levels.
# Storming
#* The second stage is characterized by a competition for power and authority, which is the source of most of the conflicts and doubts about the success of the team.
#* If teamwork is low in this stage, it is very unlikely that the team will get past their conflicts. If there is a high degree of teamwork and willingness to collaborate, then the team might have a brighter future.
# Norming
#* The third stage is characterized by increasing levels of solidarity, interdependence, and cohesiveness, while simultaneously making an effort to adjust to the team environment.
#* This stage shows much higher levels of teamwork that make it easier for the above characteristics to occur.
# Performing
#* This final stage of team development includes a comfortable environment in which team members are effectively completing tasks in an interdependent and cohesive manner.
#* This stage is characterized by the highest levels of comfort, success, interdependence, and maturity, and therefore includes the highest levels of teamwork.

===Enhancing teamwork===
One way organizational psychologists measure teamwork is through the Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) Teamwork Test. This test was developed by Michael Stevens and Michael Campion in 1994. It assesses people who want to join a team by measuring 14 KSA requirements for teamwork, especially within formal teams. The test has two main categories: Interpersonal KSAs that contain items such as Conflict Resolution and Communication, and Self-Management KSAs that include items such as Goal Setting and Task Coordination.

Teamwork can be enhanced through team development interventions (TDIs) such as leadership training, team training, team debriefing, and team building. These TDIs improve communication, coordination, cooperation, and conflict management within teams. Promoting a sense of community among the team members through efforts such as group events also contributes to the enhancement of teamwork.

=== Leadership and teamwork ===
Leaders should establish trust with their teams and provide mutual encouragement to support the success of teams. Leaders can model collaborative behavior to demonstrate effective teamwork to their teams. Team leaders should be both task- and relationship-oriented to facilitate relationships that enhance teamwork. Leaders should ensure that the team member identify and understand their roles and responsibilities within the team. A successful team aligns it objectives with the organization’s vision and goals. Leaders are responsible for inspiring and motivating teams to facilitate the alignment of their objectives with those of the organization.

== Drawbacks and benefits ==
Utilizing teamwork is sometimes unnecessary and can lead to teams not reaching their performance peak. Some of those disadvantages include:
* Social loafing: This phenomenon appears when a person working in a group puts in less effort than they can towards a task. If other members of the team are exerting comparatively more effort, this can create conflict and lead to lower levels of performance.
* Behavioral conflicts or ingrained individualism: Employees at higher organizational levels have adapted to positions that require more individual initiative, and therefore have trouble engaging in collaborative work. This creates a more competitive environment with less communication and more conflict. This disadvantage is mostly seen in organizations that utilize teamwork in an extremely hierarchical environment.
* Individual tasks: Certain tasks do not require teamwork, and are more appropriate for individual work. By assigning a team to complete an &#x27;individual task&#x27;, there can be high levels of conflict between members which can damage the team&#x27;s dynamic and weaken their overall performance.
* Groupthink: This is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people when, from a desire for conflict-avoidance, the desire for cohesiveness is greater than the desire for the best decisions. When a team experiences groupthink, alternative solutions will not be suggested due to fear of rejection or disagreement within the group. Group members will measure success based on the harmony of their group and not by the outcome of their decisions. One way to counteract groupthink is to have members of a group be from diverse backgrounds and have different characteristics (gender, age, nationality). Another way to avoid groupthink is to require each member to suggest different ideas.

Working in teams has also shown to be very beneficial. Some advantages of teamwork include:
* Problem solving: A group of people can bring together various perspectives and combine views and opinions to rapidly and effectively solve an issue. Due to the team&#x27;s culture, each team member has a responsibility to contribute equally and offer their unique perspective on a problem to arrive at the best possible solution. Teamwork can lead to better decisions, products, or services. The effectiveness of teamwork depends on the following six components of collaboration among team members: communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion.
* Healthy competition: This can motivate people and help the team excel.
* Relationship development: A team that continues to work together will eventually develop an increased level of bonding. This can help members avoid unnecessary conflicts since they have become well acquainted with each other through teamwork. By building strong relationships between members, team members&#x27; satisfaction with their team increases, therefore improving both teamwork and performance.
* Individual qualities: Every team member can offer their unique knowledge and ability to help improve other team members. Through teamwork the sharing of these qualities allows team members to be more productive in the future.
* Motivation: Working collaboratively can lead to increased motivation levels within a team due to increasing accountability for individual performance. When groups are being compared, members tend to become more ambitious to perform better. Providing groups with a comparison standard increases their performance level thus encouraging members to work collaboratively.

Paulus describes additional benefits of teamwork:
* shared workload
* opportunity to achieve leadership and social satisfaction
* sense of belonging to a successful team
* ability to accomplish more than if team members worked individually

<text>Hero (released in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Australia as Accidental Hero) is a 1992 American comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Frears. It was written by David Webb Peoples, from a story written by Peoples, Laura Ziskin and Alvin Sargent, and stars Dustin Hoffman, Geena Davis, Andy García and Joan Cusack. Following &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990), it was the second American feature film by British filmmaker Frears.

==Plot==

Bernie LaPlante is a pickpocket and petty criminal who anonymously rescues survivors, including TV reporter Gale Gayley, at an airplane crash. At the same time, he also steals her purse, losing a shoe in the process. After his car breaks down, he flags down John Bubber, a homeless Vietnam War veteran, and tells him about the rescue at the crash site, giving him his remaining shoe. When Deke, Gale&#x27;s television station news director, offers $1 million to the &quot;Angel of Flight 104&quot;, Bernie realizes he can&#x27;t claim the reward, due to his arrest while fencing credit cards he stole from the people he rescued. John contacts Gale, recounting Bernie&#x27;s tale of the rescue, and provides the single shoe to take credit for the selfless act.

When Bernie tries to tell people that John is a fake, the media, after sensationalizing his heroic image, will not believe Bernie. Bernie is released from jail, and his lawyer informs him that he will be heading to prison soon because of the stolen goods he carried in his apartment. Gale, as one of the crash survivors, considers herself to be in John&#x27;s debt, and soon grooms his public image. She finds herself falling in love with him, even though she has questions about his authenticity. Despite his reluctant acceptance of his fame, he turns out to be a decent person, using his fame and reward money to help sick children and the homeless.

John finds himself in an ethical dilemma, as his persona is inspirational to countless people. Meanwhile, Bernie continues to aggravate his ex-wife Evelyn, and fails to bond with his son Joey, who is now enamored with John. He begins to feel that if Joey is going to idolize anyone, perhaps John is the better choice.

A police detective tells Gale her credit cards were recovered during Bernie&#x27;s arrest. She and her cameraman Chucky break into Bernie&#x27;s apartment with the help of Winston, the landlord. While searching for evidence to incriminate Bernie, Gale finds a stolen Silver Microphone Award she won in New York City, the night before the crash. Bernie arrives, only to be confronted by her, as she speculates that John stole her purse in a moment of weakness during the rescue, sold it to Bernie, and accuses him of attempting to now blackmail John. They are interrupted by Winston, who says John is on television, about to commit suicide by jumping from the ledge of a high-rise skyscraper.

Gale rushes to the scene and brings Bernie along, threatening to have him prosecuted if John leaps to his death. She demands Bernie apologize for the attempted blackmail. Evelyn and Joey rush there as well, with Evelyn reminiscing how Bernie is selfish and cynical, but always becomes a great person in a crisis. Bernie goes out on the ledge, hatching a scheme to milk the media attention for all its worth. He convinces John that the world needs a hero, and that he is clearly the right one for the job, although he does negotiate a discreet share of the $1 million to pay for his son&#x27;s college tuition, as well as a letter to the judge to put in a good word for him to suspend his prison sentence. When Bernie slips off the ledge, John grabs him and pulls him to safety, a (true) hero once more. When Gale sees Bernie&#x27;s face covered with dirt, as on the night of the crash, she realizes it was he who saved her. She confronts him &quot;off the record&quot; with her supposition, but he insists that John was the hero.

As Gale leaves, she thanks Bernie for saving her life. He reflexively replies, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome.&quot; She tells him to tell Joey the truth. John agrees to continue playing the part of public hero. While on an excursion to the zoo, Bernie decides to tell Joey the true story of the crash. After he does so, a lady cries out that her daughter has fallen into the lion&#x27;s cage. Joey pleads with him to help, to which he sighs, slips off his shoes, and heads off to see what he can do.

Principal photography on the film began shooting October 30, 1991, in Chicago with studio work at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California, and Los Angeles, California, along with the crash scene on-location in Piru, California. Filming wrapped March 20, 1992.

The colossal staging of a crashed Boeing 727 airplane in December 1991 involved creating a complete location set in Piru, California. The derelict fuselage was blown up over a bridge and a recreated river and river bed. After the failure of the first explosion, a second rigged explosive realistically recreated the crash scene in which the plane is torn apart.

==Influences==
&quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; is a film with a similar theme by Preston Sturges. Many reviewers referred to the obvious similarities between &quot;Hero&quot; and Sturges&#x27;s screwball comedies. The classic Frank Capra film &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; was also cited as a model for Laura Ziskin, who both produced and supplied the story for &quot;Hero&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $19.5 million. Internationally, it grossed $47 million, for a worldwide total of $67 million. Columbia lost $25.6 million on the film.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 67% rating, based on 21 reviews. On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Haphazard and erratic, involving only in fits and starts, Hero&#x27;s core is nevertheless so shrewdly and gleefully cynical about public heroism and the cult of celebrity it is impossible not to be at least sporadically amused and entertained.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; noted, &quot;It has all the ingredients for a terrific entertainment, but it lingers over the kinds of details that belong in a different kind of movie. It comes out of the tradition of those rat-a-tat Preston Sturges comedies of the 1940s, and when Chevy Chase, as a wise-guy TV boss, barks orders into a phone, it finds the right note.&quot;

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said, &quot;If a hero is one who perseveres and never gives up, this is one &#x27;Hero&#x27; that should have quit when it was ahead.&quot;

==Home media==
The film debuted at number 3 in the U.S. home media market. It was released on VHS April 15, 1993. Another version presented in widescreen was also released on VHS.

A DVD was released May 25, 1999, and was re-released in 2004 by Sony Pictures. Special features for the 1999 DVD (but not the 2004 release) included liner notes and theatrical trailers. The 1999 DVD was also a double-sided disc, presented in widescreen (side A) and fullscreen (side B). The only special feature for the 2004 DVD includes theatrical trailers, and was presented only in fullscreen. Mill Creek Entertainment had recently picked up the DVD distribution rights for the film.

The DVD was released again in 2012. Unlike the first two DVD releases by Sony, this one includes no special features, and is presented in widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1:85.

<text>Ahn Jae-wook (; born October 30, 1971) is a South Korean actor and singer.

==Career==
Ahn Jae-wook spent most of his childhood in his hometown, the district of Donam-dong in Seoul, before graduating from Seoul Institute of the Arts, where he majored in theater. After graduating in 1994, Ahn made his acting debut in &quot;Song of a Blind Bird&quot;, which was based on a real-life story, followed by supporting roles in several 1995–96 television series such as &quot;Hotel&quot; and &quot;Their Embrace&quot;. In 1997 he and costar Choi Jin-sil shot to stardom in the highly popular trendy drama &quot;Star in My Heart&quot;, which reached ratings of over 49%. It not only ignited trends in hairstyle, fashion and products featured in the series, Ahn also became a Korean Wave star, extending his popularity to China, Japan and Southeast Asian countries.

&quot;Star in My Heart&quot; likewise kick-started Ahn&#x27;s music career. &quot;Forever&quot;, which was featured in the series&#x27; ending during the concert of his character Kang Min, sold over 700,000 copies, and became the title song of his debut album. He continued to compose and sing over the years, holding numerous concerts in Japan and China, and releasing albums such as &quot;Memories&quot; and &quot;Reds in Ahn Jae-wook&quot;.

In 1998, he played lead roles in three films – &quot;Rub Love&quot; with Lee Ji-eun, &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon&quot; with Kim Hye-soo, and &quot;First Kiss&quot; with Choi Ji-woo—but did not meet with box office success despite his popularity at the time. He also starred in &quot;Garden of Heaven&quot; with Lee Eun-ju in 2003, and the Korea-Japan telecinema project &quot;Triangle&quot; in 2009.

Instead, Ahn focused on the small screen, appearing in over 10 television series from the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s. Among these were &quot;Goodbye My Love&quot; with Kim Hee-sun, &quot;Oh Pil-seung and Bong Soon-young&quot; (also known as &quot;Oh Feel Young&quot;) with Chae Rim, and &quot;I Love You&quot; (also known as &quot;Saranghae&quot;) with Seo Ji-hye.

As he entered his forties and his matinee idol status gave way to younger actors, Ahn returned to his stage roots. He played Daniel in &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; (a Korean adaptation of the Czech musical &quot;&quot;) from 2009 to 2011, then reprised the role in the musical&#x27;s run in Tokyo, Japan in 2012.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of broadcaster MBC, Ahn headlined &quot;Lights and Shadows&quot; in 2011. The sprawling drama, which spotlights Korean show business against the backdrop of history in the 1960s to the 1980s, was number one in its timeslot for 20 consecutive weeks.

Ahn then played the title role in the 2012 Korean staging of &quot;Rudolf&quot;, a musical about the 1889 Mayerling Incident involving the Crown Prince of Austria.

In February 2013 Ahn underwent brain surgery in the U.S. for a subarachnoid hemorrhage. After resting for a year, Ahn returned to work in April 2014 via the musical &quot;Le Roi Soleil&quot;. He celebrated his 20th anniversary in entertainment by holding a concert titled &quot;One Fine Day&quot; in October 2014.

In September 2017, It was confirmed that Ahn will be a fixed cast member in Netflix&#x27;s variety show &quot;Busted!&quot;. Ahn&#x27;s involvement in a drunk driving incident in February 2019 caused him to be omitted in the promotions of Busted&#x27;s second season - including removal from the opening credits and promotional posters, as well as to skip the already-scheduled musical &quot;Hero&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ahn married musical theatre actress Choi Hyun-joo on June 1, 2015. The couple met in 2014 when they were cast as lovers in the stage musical &quot;Rudolf&quot;. The couple have a daughter and a son.

<doc id="1175766" wikidata="Q275760" url="?curid=1175766" title="Henry Armetta">
<text>Henry Armetta (born Enrico Armetta; July 4, 1888 – October 21, 1945) was an American character actor who appeared in at least 150 American films, beginning in silent movies. His last film was released posthumously in 1946, the year after his death.

==Biography==
Armetta was born in Palermo, Sicily, Italy. At the age of 14, he stowed away on a boat to America. The immigration authorities were prepared to send him back, but he found an Italian family to act as his sponsor. He settled in New York City where he delivered groceries, sold sandwiches and pizzas and performed other menial tasks to get by. He eventually ended up working as a pants presser at a well known club where he was befriended by actor/producer Raymond Hitchcock. Hitchcock got him a chorus part in his play &quot;A Yankee Consul&quot;.

After a friend told him about southern California&#x27;s mushrooming film industry, Armetta hitchhiked to Hollywood in 1920 and soon found work in films as a stereotypical Italian, often playing a barber, grocer or restaurant owner. He went on to appear in over 152 films (at least 24 films in 1934 alone), often uncredited. Armetta appeared in several films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer including &quot;Romance&quot; (1930) starring Greta Garbo, &quot;What! No Beer?&quot; (1933) with Buster Keaton and Jimmy Durante, &quot;Everybody Sing&quot; (1938) featuring Judy Garland, Allan Jones, and Fanny Brice, &quot;The Big Store&quot; (1941) opposite the Marx Brothers, and a much thinner Armetta was briefly glimpsed in one of his last appearances in the MGM Technicolor musical &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; (1945) with Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly. 

==Death==
Armetta died in 1945 of a heart attack in San Diego, California, aged 57. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Sambo is a derogatory label for a person of African descent in the Spanish language. Historically, it is a name in American English derived from a Spanish term for a person of African and Native American ancestry. After the Civil War, during and after the Jim Crow era the term was used in conversation, print advertising and household items as a pejorative descriptor for black people. The term is now considered offensive in American and British English.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sambo&quot; came into the English language from , the Spanish word in Latin America for a person of South American negro, mixed European, and native descent. This in turn may have come from one of three African language sources. &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third International Dictionary&quot; holds that it may have come from the Kongo word (&#x27;monkey&#x27;). The Royal Spanish Academy gives the origin from a Latin word, possibly the adjective or another modern Spanish term (), both of which translate to &#x27;bow-legged&#x27;.

The equivalent term in Brazil is . However, in Portugal and Portuguese-speaking Africa, &quot;cafuzo&quot; is used to refer to someone born of an African person and a person of mixed African and European ancestry.

Another possibility is that Sambo may be a corruption of the name Samba (meaning &quot;second son&quot; in the language of the Fulbe, an ethnicity spread throughout West Africa). Michael A. Gomez has argued that Sambo is actually a Muslim name and that men named Sambo in the South were likely to have been slaves who practiced Islam.

== Literature ==
Examples of &quot;Sambo&quot; as a common name can be found as far back as the 19th century. In &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (serialised from 1847) by William M. Thackeray, the black-skinned Indian servant of the Sedley family from Chapter One is called Sambo. Similarly, in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe, one of Simon Legree&#x27;s overseers is named Sambo. Instances of it being used as a stereotypical name for African Americans can be found as early as the Civil War.

The name &quot;Sambo&quot; became especially associated with the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Story of Little Black Sambo&quot; by Helen Bannerman, published in 1899. It was the story of a southern Indian boy named &quot;Sambo&quot; who outwitted a group of hungry tigers. Bannerman also wrote &quot;Little Black Mingo&quot;, &quot;Little Black Quasha&quot;, and &quot;Little Black Quibba&quot;.

== Places ==
===Sambo&#x27;s Grave===

Sambo&#x27;s Grave is the 1736 burial site of a young Indian cabin boy or slave, on unconsecrated ground in a field near the small village of Sunderland Point, near Heysham and Overton, Lancashire, England. Sunderland Point used to be a port, serving cotton, sugar and slave ships from the West Indies and North America.

===Sambo&#x27;s restaurant chain===
The once-popular Sambo&#x27;s restaurant chain used the Helen Bannerman images to promote and decorate their restaurants, although the restaurants were originally claimed to have been named after the chain&#x27;s co-owners, Samuel Battistone and Newell Bohnett.

<doc id="1175768" wikidata="Q6208160" url="?curid=1175768" title="John Thomas (Christadelphian)">
<text>Dr. John Thomas (12 April 1805 – 5 March 1871) was a British religious leader and founder of the Christadelphians. He was a dedicated Bible expositor, and author of Elpis Israel, the first major writing to bring to light the subject of &quot;God Manifestation&quot; and the hope of Israel for future generations. In this work, he was able to draw upon his understanding of Biblical Prophecy to predict the return of Israel in the near future, which came to pass in 1948, with the establishment of the state of Israel. Thomas has often been branded as a false teacher and a heretic by Christians due to his denial of the Christian doctrines regarding the Trinity, the personhood of the Devil, the existence of demons.

==Early life==
John Thomas was born in Hoxton Square, Hackney, London, on 12 April 1805, the son of a dissenting minister, also named John Thomas. His family is reputed to be descended from French Huguenot refugees. His family moved frequently, as his father took up various pastorates, including that of a congregation in London, a brief stay in northern Scotland, back to London, and then to Chorley, Lancashire. At the age of 16, in Chorley, he began studying medicine. His family moved back to London, but John Thomas stayed in Chorley. After two years, he returned to London to continue his studies at the Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27;s hospitals for a further three years. He trained as a surgeon and had an interest in chemistry and biology, publishing several medical articles in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, one of which argued in favour of the importance of the use of corpses for the study of medicine (it was illegal in England to dissect them at this time).

==Association with Alexander Campbell==
Thomas emigrated to North America in 1832, travelling on board the &quot;Marquis of Wellesley&quot;. Following a near shipwreck he vowed to find out the truth about life and God through personal Biblical study. Initially he sought to avoid the kind of sectarianism he had seen in England. In this he found sympathy with the rapidly emerging Restoration Movement in the United States at the time. This movement sought a reform based upon the Bible alone as a sufficient guide and rejected all creeds. He became convinced by the Restoration Movement of the need for baptism and joined them in October 1832. He soon came to know a prominent leader in the movement, Alexander Campbell, who encouraged him to become an evangelist. He spent his time travelling around the eastern States of America preaching, until eventually settling down as a preacher in Philadelphia. It was here on 1 January 1834 that he married Ellen Hunt.

Thomas also wrote for and was editor of the &quot;Apostolic Advocate&quot; which first appeared in May 1834. His studies during this period of his life generated the foundation for many of the beliefs he came to espouse as a Christadelphian and he began to believe that the basis of knowledge before baptism was greater than the Restoration Movement believed and also that widely held orthodox Christian beliefs were wrong. While his freedom to believe his unique beliefs was accepted, many objected to the preaching of these beliefs as necessary for salvation. This difference led to a series of debates particularly between Thomas and Alexander Campbell. Because Thomas eventually rebaptised himself and rejected his former beliefs and associations, he was formally disfellowshipped in 1837. Some people, nonetheless, associated with him and accepted his views.

At this time the Millerite or Adventist movement was growing, and in 1843 Thomas was introduced to William Miller, the leader of the Millerites. He admired their willingness to question orthodox beliefs and agreed with their belief in the second coming of Christ and the founding of a millennial age upon His return. Thomas continued his studies of the Bible and in 1846 travelled to New York, where he gave a series of lectures covering 30 doctrinal subjects that later formed part of his book &quot;Elpis Israel&quot; (The Hope of Israel).

==Christadelphians==
Based upon his newfound understanding of the Bible, Thomas was rebaptised (a third and final time) in 1847 and the groups of and individuals who shared his beliefs continued to grow. In 1848 the movement became international when he travelled to England in order to preach what he now saw as the true gospel message. Upon his return to America, Thomas moved from Richmond, Virginia to New York City and began to preach there. He made a point of speaking to the Jewish community because Dr Thomas had come to believe that Christianity did not replace the Law of Moses but rather fulfilled it. He believed that Christians must, though faith and baptism, become the &quot;seed&quot; (or, &quot;descendant&quot;) of Abraham.

It was at this time that Thomas and those who shared similar beliefs became known as the Royal Association of Believers. This group of believers used the term &quot;ecclesia&quot;, a Greek word meaning &quot;assembly&quot;, to describe them. However, the movement did not have an ‘official’ name until 1864, when a name was chosen during the American Civil War (see below). Instead of having a system of clergy, all the brethren took equal responsibility on a rota to take on the role of presiding and speaking during their meetings.

When in 1861 the American Civil War broke out, Thomas travelled to the South and became concerned that the war had placed believers upon opposing sides. The movement as a whole considered that the war required them to make a stand for what they believed in as conscientious objectors. In order to be exempted from military service, it was required that believers had to belong to a recognised religious group that did not agree with participation in war. Thus in 1864, Thomas coined the name &quot;Christadelphian&quot; to identify members of the movement. The term &quot;Christadelphian&quot; comes from Greek and means &quot;Brethren in Christ&quot;. It was during the war that Thomas worked on the three volumes of &quot;Eureka&quot;, which discusses the meaning of the Book of Revelation.

On 5 May 1868, Thomas returned to England, where he travelled extensively giving lecturers about the Gospel message and meeting with Christadelphians in England. During this period of his life he found extensive support and help from Robert Roberts who had been converted during a previous visit to England by Thomas. Following his return to America, he made one final tour of the Christadelphian congregations prior to his death on 5 March 1871 in Jersey City. He was buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

==Legacy==
Thomas did not claim to be any kind of prophet, or in any way inspired, but through study and borrowing from the work of others he believed that many traditional church teachings were incorrect and that from the Bible he could prove that position.
:The Lecturer [John Thomas] commenced by denying a statement which had appeared in many of the London and county newspapers, and amongst them, one made by a religious Editor in this town, to the effect that he assumed to himself the true, infallible, prophetic character, as one sent from God, &quot;verbatim&quot;. He would appeal to his writings -- and he had written a great deal in twelve years -- and to his speeches, whether he had ever claimed to be such, in the remotest degree whatever. He believed truth as it was taught in the scriptures of truth...

Modern Christadelphians generally believe Thomas was right and adhere to the positions he established as defined within the Christadelphian statements of faith; Christadelphians feel, too, that Thomas&#x27; example of an inquiring attitude is also an important legacy.

Thomas wrote several books, one of which, &quot;Elpis Israel&quot; (1848), in its first section, sets out many of the fundamental scriptural principles believed by Christadelphians to this day.

Thomas&#x27; exposition of Bible prophecy led to him making various detailed predictions about then current-day events of which some did not come to pass, as was noted in the foreword to subsequent editions of &quot;Elpis Israel&quot; after his death, a point that Thomas himself accepted could happen.

<doc id="1175776" wikidata="Q5630622" url="?curid=1175776" title="HMAS Tobruk (D37)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Tobruk&quot; (D37) was a of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, the destroyer was completed in 1950. &quot;Tobruk&quot; was deployed to the Korean War twice, and served with the Far East Strategic Reserve on three occasions during the late 1950s. In 1960, she was damaged beyond economical repair by sister ship during a gunnery exercise, which led to the destroyer&#x27;s decommissioning that year, and sale for scrap in 1971.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Tobruk&quot; was a Battle-class destroyer. The ship had a standard load displacement of 2,436 tons and a full load displacement of 3,400 tons. She was long overall and long between perpendiculars, had a beam of , and a draught of . Propulsion machinery consisted of Admiralty 3-drum boilers connected to Parsons geared turbines, which supplied to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Although designed with a maximum speed of , &quot;Tobruk&quot; achieved during full-power trials. Maximum range was at , or at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 19 officers and 301 sailors.
&quot;Tobruk&quot;″s primary armament consisted of four Mark III guns, fitted forward in two twin turrets. For anti-aircraft defence, the ship carried twelve 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft guns: three twin mountings on the aft half of the ship, and six single mountings. Two five-tube Pentad torpedo tube sets were carried. &quot;Tobruk&quot; was also fitted with a Squid anti-submarine mortar.

The ship was laid down by the Cockatoo Docks and Engineering Company at their shipyard on Cockatoo Island, New South Wales on 5 August 1946. &quot;Tobruk&quot; was launched on 20 December 1947 by the wife of Bill Riordan, Minister for the Navy. The destroyer was commissioned into the RAN on 8 May 1950, although she was not completed until 17 May. The ship&#x27;s name comes from the Siege of Tobruk.

==Operational history==
After completing trials and workups, &quot;Tobruk&quot; was deployed to the Korean War in August 1951. Between October 1951 and January 1952, the destroyer carried out six patrols, primarily serving as an aircraft carrier escort, or performing shore bombardments. &quot;Tobruk&quot; returned to Australia in February 1952. In October, she was part of the security patrol around the Montebello Islands during Operation Hurricane, the first British nuclear weapons test. In June 1953, &quot;Tobruk&quot; returned to Korea for a second deployment. Although a ceasefire was signed in July 1953, &quot;Tobruk&quot; remained in the area until January 1954, then returned to Australia for a refit. &quot;Tobruk&quot; received the battle honour &quot;Korea 1951–53&quot; for these deployments.
After completing refit, &quot;Tobruk&quot; operated in the waters of Australia and New Guinea until mid 1955, when she joined several RAN ships in a deployment to South East Asia. In 1956, she was assigned to the Far East Strategic Reserve. A further deployment was made in 1957, during which &quot;Tobruk&quot; was involved in the Malayan Emergency; this was later recognised with a second battle honour: &quot;Malaya 1957&quot;. On 26 April, during night exercises, a star shell fired by landed in one of &quot;Tobruk&quot;″s gun bays, killing one sailor and severely wounding another. The destroyer&#x27;s third and final assignment to the Strategic Reserve occurred during 1959. After a refit during early 1960, &quot;Tobruk&quot; and several other RAN ships made port visits to Nouméa and New Guinea.

==Fate==
In September 1960, &quot;Tobruk&quot; was performing gunnery exercises with sister ship off Jervis Bay. A malfunction in &quot;Anzac&quot;″s gun direction equipment negated the deliberate 6° mis-aiming of her guns, with the resulting shell hitting &quot;Tobruk&quot; and doing enough damage to the destroyer to require lengthy repairs. Temporary repairs were made to &quot;Tobruk&quot; in Jervis Bay before the ship limped back to Sydney, where she was placed into reserve on 29 October 1960. Two of &quot;Anzac&quot;″s crew were charged over the incident.

Repairing the destroyer was considered uneconomical, and she remained moored until the ship was marked for disposal on 14 May 1971. &quot;Tobruk&quot; was sold for scrap to Fujita Salvage Company Limited of Osaka, Japan on 15 February 1972, and departed Sydney under tow on 10 April 1972.

<text>BBC TV Europe was a BBC subscription-funded television service established in 1987, serving continental Europe, initially Scandinavia. It was available on satellite and cable.

The channel was branded as &quot;BBC 1/2 Mix&quot; when it launched on 4 June 1987, but was rebranded &quot;BBC TV Europe&quot; on 1 April 1989.

Initially, two regional telecommunications companies in Denmark, KTAS (Københavns Telefon A/S) and JTAS (Jydsk Telefon A/S) contacted the BBC with a view to retransmit both BBC1 and 2 on their cable networks in Denmark, offering the BBC payment to cover the costs of the satellite slots. The BBC&#x27;s commercial division, BBC Enterprises, looked into the proposal but found it would be impossible to secure rights for this. This led the BBC to instead create a separate new channel for Denmark, known as BBC 1/2 Mix. This later expanded to Norway in late 1987 and Sweden in early 1988.
The channel broadcast a mix of the programmes shown on BBC1 and BBC2 in the United Kingdom, as well as the BBC&#x27;s domestic &quot;BBC Six O&#x27;Clock News&quot; bulletin, together with the regional news service from London. BBC1 programming took priority: when a programme on BBC1 could not be shown on the channel for rights reasons, it was replaced with a programme shown on BBC2.

The channel made its formal launch in Portugal at the facilities of the British Council in Lisbon on 20 April 1989. The channel&#x27;s schedule averaged seventeen hours a day, from 7am to midnight. Piracy was a recurring issue, as such the BBC had to hire sales agents by country for the sale of authorised BBC TV Europe decoders and subscriptions.

The channel was managed and operated by the BBC, but jointly marketed by the two Danish telecommunications companies. However, they were not able to make a profit from the channel, and sold their interest in it to the BBC, which renamed it &quot;BBC TV Europe&quot; and took full control of its operations and commercialisation, making it available to the whole of Western and Northern Europe (excluding the UK), and also making it officially available for individual viewers who wished to receive it directly via satellite by means of subscription. In 1990, a second service for non-UK viewers entitled &quot;Enterprise Channel&quot; was launched to complement the main BBC TV Europe service, but by the end of that year it had been folded back into the existing network.

The channel also carried the English team&#x27;s matches in the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

On 11 March 1991 the channel was replaced by BBC World Service Television.

<text>Suzuki GSX-R is a series of sports motorcycles made by Japanese automotive manufacturer Suzuki since 1984.

== First generation: 1984 ==

In 1984, Suzuki released the first GSX-R (GSX-R400, internal model number GK71b), on sale only in Japan, taking advantage of licensing laws there which were prohibitive of bikes over 400cc. Then in 1985 a 750cc GSX-R was introduced and followed by an 1100cc version in 1986. If the 750cc bike was a fast and capable race-bike for the street, the 1100 was an exercise in raw power and excess. A bit heavier than the 750, at a claimed 435 lbs for the 750 and about 480 lbs for the 1100, but with considerably more power (130 hp stock) and torque. Previous to both of these models.

The first GSX-R of 1984 was a breakthrough model and the closest that any Japanese manufacturer had yet come to building a &quot;race bike with lights&quot;. Throughout the 1970s the big four Japanese manufacturers had built bikes with a similar architecture: steel double loop frames, air-cooled transverse fours with either SOHC or DOHC configurations.

At the start of the 1970s two-valve-per-cylinder heads were ubiquitous, by the end of the decade four valve heads were available on the high end bikes. The similarity of the designs across brands and years led to the coining of the term &quot;UJM&quot; for Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which began with Honda&#x27;s CB-750 of 1969.

These bikes were available in a variety of sizes from 350cc to 1200cc from all four of the Japanese manufacturers, and beginning in 1976 served as the basis for production-based race bikes in the American Motorcycle Association (AMA) Superbike Series. As a result of the experience on the race track it became obvious that the big UJMs were not ideal for racing. Weight was high, frames lacked stiffness and flexed in disturbing ways, power from the big motors overwhelmed the tire technology of the day.

Beginning around 1980 all four manufacturers began to modify the UJM formula in different ways to achieve performance advantages on the track and product differentiation in the market. In 1982 Honda introduced the VF series, which used a V4 rather than transverse-four motor configuration. The first model year only cruiser style bikes were offered, but in 1983 the first sport bike based on the V4 became available:the Honda VFR-750 Interceptor. AMA rules for Superbike racing were changed in 1983 to decrease maximum engine size from 1025cc to 750cc. The Honda Interceptor was ready to compete in this new category. In addition to the innovative V4 engine configuration, it was liquid cooled, and it sported a rectangular tube steel frame, to increase stiffness, as opposed to the more traditional round tubes of the UJM era. The Interceptor was a breakthrough for Honda, and it won many races, including Daytona, and was the second-place finisher in the series. A year later, in 1984 the entire front row at Daytona were Interceptors and Freddie Spencer repeated his win on the V4 Honda.

In 1985, both Yamaha and Suzuki answered the challenge with their own innovations. Yamaha offered the FZ750 which was the first in a series of bikes with 5 valves per cylinder. While it was still a transverse 4, the cylinders were set at a 45 degree angle, unlike the more typical nearly vertical placement common to UJMs. The frame was rectangular section steel like the Honda.

It was into this competitive environment that Suzuki dropped the first 750cc GSX-R model ready to race in the new size mandated by AMA Superbike rules. The GSX-R had the most conventional engine of the three: a four valve per cylinder, inline four - it was a clear descendant of the previous GS series of motors. Cooling was provided by what Suzuki described as an air-oil mix. Oil temps were kept low by a large oil cooler, and engine internals were designed to push the oil at pressure as a spray where it was most needed, notably the underside of the pistons. The principal designer for the bike was Hiroshi Fujiwara, a Suzuki engineer.

The frame was the most innovative aspect of the bike. Suzuki abandoned steel altogether and built the frame from welded square section aluminium tubing. To gain the rigidity they wanted, the tubes were quite large, giving the bike a unique appearance. Whereas the Honda and Yamaha were fast street bikes that could be easily raced, the Suzuki was clearly a race bike that could be ridden on the street. The seating position was the racer&#x27;s crouch, not the street rider&#x27;s semi-upright one. It shipped stock with the motor tuned to deliver 100HP, but could be easily boosted to 135 with the race tuning kit. It was the lightest of the superbikes by a good margin, weighing only 388 lbs(176 kg). Styling too was aggressive and unique, with a signature full fairing holding two round headlights, starting a trend that continues on supersport motorcycles to this day.

Despite the excellence of the bike it was not able to immediately dethrone the Honda team, who won the AMA Superbike series with the VFR Interceptor from 1984 to 1988. In 1989 Suzuki did accomplish this goal. By then the Suzuki had already become the favorite of privateers, racers not backed by a factory. Its relative simplicity (compared to the V4), cost and reliability made it the obvious choice for individuals competing on their own dime. Over time it has also established an excellent record in endurance racing winning the Bol&#x27;d&#x27;Or 12 times between 1993 and 2011.

== Second generation: 1988 ==

The second generation of GSX-Rs, by then available in 250cc sizes too (primarily for Japan), was released in 1988, again initially on the flagship 750cc, the 1100cc version as well as the smaller siblings following a year later. The new generation GSX-R kept the same basic layout of the previous generation, but the frame was now made of large cast and formed parts, as opposed to the welded from basic rectangular tubes as in the previous generation. New &quot;slingshot&quot; carbs were another new feature, one that gave the model its nickname and were announced on the body with decals proclaiming this innovation.

Between major revisions all models received updates annually, sometimes quite significant, and the model name was incremented with the next letter in the alphabet beginning with F for the 1985 model. The generations are marked by major changes in the frame and/or engine.

The second generation grew in power (and weight) as suspension components were continually upgraded to deal with the increased power and traction of the improving tires of the era. By 1991 the 750cc machine was up to 458 lbs. 1991 was the first year where the dual round headlights were replaced with a more aerodynamic shape.

== Third generation: 1992 ==

In 1992 the GSX-R 750 was given the model designation GSX-R 750WN - the &quot;W&quot; signifying the first water-cooled engine. The innovative air-oil design of 1985 was simply no longer able to provide enough cooling for the power the engine was putting out, now a claimed 118 hp. The weight of the previous year, 458 lbs (207 kg), was maintained while adding the water cooling.
Also to be noted this was the last year of the &quot;Power Jet&quot; which came stock on the carburetors since 1989. These were noticeable by the short fuel line to the left of the carburetor, running the length from the fuel bowl to the top of the bell housing. Basic function of the power jet was the smooth out fuel delivery from 9.5k- 10k rpm all the way to the rev limiter. However, these jets were blanked out on the US models but were fully functional for Canadian buyers and other countries. The water cooled bikes would not be available to the US until 1993.

== Fourth generation: 1994 ==

A comprehensive redesign, still using the same basic frame and engine architecture, resulted in a bike 22 lb (10 kg) lighter, down to 436 lb (198 kg). The following year would be the last for the double downtube / angled top tube frame design that had originated on the 1985 GSX-R.

== Fifth generation: 1996 ==

The old frame design, a unique signature of the GSX-R was dated. By 1996 all of the manufacturers were using aluminum frames, and most of them were stiffer and lighter than the Suzuki frame, and featured large beams running in a straight line from the steerer tube to the swingarm pivot. The 1996 followed this principle, and along with the new frame a completely revised engine was used. As a result of this comprehensive redesign the GSX-R began its return to the front of the production racer pack, finally beginning to achieve the AMA Superbike domination it had been designed for a decade previously. The new architecture allowed the GSX-R to win an impressive 10 of 11 consecutive AMA Superbike championships beginning in 1999.

The 1996 GSX-R was a return to the original formula, with an emphasis on light weight, not just power. Weight was back down to an impressive 394 lb (178 kg).

Even though later models also used the Suzuki Ram Air Direct system, GSX-R&#x27;s from 1996 to 1999 became known as the &quot;SRAD&quot; models.

An update in 1998 saw fuel injection added, increasing power to 135 hp, but other than that the GSX-R750 SRAD remained largely unaltered until its replacement arrived in 2000.

== Sixth generation: 2000 ==

The year 2000 again saw a total redesign of the engine, now with dual throttle valve electronic fuel injection. A new frame was also introduced in this model that was lighter, and had a longer swingarm than the previous model. Performance was improved, and the 2000 model became one of the most appreciated of all GSX-Rs. More than a decade later, in 2011, Cycle World magazine would describe it as &quot;one of the greatest sportbikes of all time&quot;. Suzuki marketed the bike as &quot;the most advanced GSX-R ever&quot;.

== GSX-R1000: 2001 ==

After a several year break a new big-bore GSX-R was offered. In place of the unique 1100cc displacement of the old model a more standard displacement of 1000cc was produced. (This aligned better with some racing series.)

The new 1000 was built with the &quot;modern style&quot; architecture and it resulted in an even larger weight loss for the litre-bike: from 487 lb to 374 lb.

=== GSX-R1000R: 2017 ===
Suzuki has released an up spec model GSX-R1000R; this R model comes with a Motion Track Brake System, Bi-directional quick shifter and launch control. Also on the R model, as reported by Sport Rider, are the same Showa Balance Free Front (BFF) fork and Balance Free Rear Cushion (BFRC Lite) shock that come standard on the 2016 Kawasaki ZX-10R.

== GSX-R125 and GSX-R150: 2017 ==

The first single-cylinder GSX-R motorcycle, the &#x27; GSX-R125 was introduced at the 2016 Intermot. The stroked-up &#x27; GSX-R150 was officially unveiled in Indonesia at the 2016 Indonesia Motorcycle Show. The engine construction, which is fuel-injected, is the same as the 2016–present Satria F/Raider underbone sold in Southeast Asia, albeit with few differences, such as gear ratio tuning, injector hole tuning (8 in Satria F, 10 in GSX-R125/150), and ECU tuning.

<doc id="1175802" wikidata="Q1798276" url="?curid=1175802" title="Stays (nautical)">
<text>Stays are ropes, wires, or rods on sailing vessels that run fore-and-aft along the centerline from the masts to the hull, deck, bowsprit, or to other masts which serve to stabilize the masts.

A stay is part of the standing rigging and is used to hold a mast upright.

It is a large strong rope, wire or rod extending from the upper end of each mast and running down towards the deck of the vessel in a midships -and- direction.

The [[Shroud (sailing)|shrouds]] serve a similar function but extend on each side of the mast and provide support in the athwartships direction. The object of both is to prevent the masts from falling down but the stays also prevent springing, when the ship is pitching deep.

Thus stays are fore and aft. Those led aft towards the vessel&#x27;s stern are [[backstay]]s while those that lead forward towards the bow are [[forestay]]s.

&quot;To stay&quot; is also a verb: to bring the ship&#x27;s head up to the wind (to point the bow upwind). This is done in order to go about (to tack; tacking is sometimes also called &quot;staying the vessel&quot;); the bow of the ship turns upwind, then continues turning until the wind comes over the other side. To miss stays is to fail in the attempt to go about; if the vessel fails to go about, she is said to . In stays, or hove in stays, is the situation of a vessel when she is staying, or in the act of going about. A vessel in bad trim, or lubberly-handled, is sure to be or : she may fairly often. A suitable vessel well handled can usually be stayed swiftly, without losing noticeable way (without slowing down), and the sails will go over gently and without fuss or overshooting.

== Types of stays ==
; forestay or headstay 
: reaches from the foremast-head towards the bowsprit end
; mainstay
: extends to the ship&#x27;s stem. The mizzenstay stretches to a collar on the main-mast, immediately above the quarterdeck.
; fore-topmast stay
: goes to the end of the bowsprit, a little beyond the forestay, on which the fore-topmast staysail runs on hanks. 
; main-topmast stay
: attaches to the hounds of the foremast, or comes on deck. 
; mizzen-topmast stay
: goes to the hounds of the main-mast. 
; top-gallant, royal, or any other masts
: have each a stay, named after their respective masts
; springstay
: is a kind of substitute nearly parallel to the principal stay, and intended to help the principal stay to support its mast
; triatic stay
: is a stay that runs between masts. On a ketch it runs between the main mast and the head of the mizzen mast and is used to stop the upper section of the mizzen mast being pulled backwards. On a steamer, an iron bar between the two knees secures the paddle-beams. (See funnel stays).

<text>Colombier () is a former municipality in the Boudry District in the canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. The municipalities of Auvernier, Bôle and Colombier merged on 1 January 2013 into the new municipality of Milvignes.

==History==
Colombier is first mentioned in 1228 as &quot;Columbier&quot;.

Four lakeside settlements from the neolithic and the Bronze Age have been discovered in Colombier. One of the largest Roman era villas in Switzerland was excavated from under the castle in 1840–42 by Frédéric Dubois de Montperreux. It was built in multiple stages between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD into a palatial mansion with a peristyle, at least two baths with mosaics and frescoes and terraced gardens. A Merovingian graveyard was found near Colombier.

In the 11th or 12th century a fortified tower was built over the ruins of the Roman villa. It expanded in the 13th century and by the 16th century had reached its present appearance.

During the Middle Ages, the &quot;Seigneurie&quot; of Colombier included the villages of Colombier and Areuse, a part of Bôle and a third of the Vogtei of Bevaix. They also had rights in Fretereules and Val-de-Ruz. The noble Colombier family were vassals of the count of Neuchâtel. During the Middle Ages, they also acquired, by marriage, the fiefs of Savagnier, Cormondrèche and the fief of the Pressoir of Colombeir in Thielle. In 1488 the Colombier lands were acquired by marriage by the de Chauvirey family of Franche-Comté. In 1513, they were acquired by Johann Jakob von Watteville of Bern. Under von Watteville, the territory expanded further into Bevaix. In 1564, the land was purchased by the Counts of Neuchâtel, for 60,000 crowns. Under Johann Jakob von Watteville, the Protestant Reformation was successfully introduced in town. When portions of the Armée de l&#x27;Est were interred in Colombier in 1871, the Catholic mass began to be read once again in the church.

The boundaries of the village are first documented in 1346. In 1357 it received, along with Bôle and Areuse, a forest which the three municipalities jointly managed until the 18th century. During the 16th and 17th centuries, much of the population was exempted from many of the feudal taxes and fees that they had paid to their feudal overlords. The last feudal tax, however, was finally abolished in the 19th century. In the middle of the 17th century, the town was saved from bankruptcy through a loan given by the bankers Abraham Mouchet and his son. Henri II d&#x27;Orléans, the Prince of Neuchatel, freed the municipality from its debts in 1657. In exchange, the municipality pledged to plant trees along the road from the lake to the castle.

A chapel is first mentioned in Colombier in 1177. It became a parish before 1228, which included Montézillon in the Middle Ages, Areuse until 1832 and Auvernier until 1879. The right to appoint the priest at St. Stefan&#x27;s church in Colombier was held by the cathedral chapter of Lausanne Cathedral. A Catholic parish was founded in 1884.

In 1734, the first spinning factory in the Lower Areuse was built in Colombier by Jean-Jacques Deluz Bied. By 1739 it had about 80 workers. The factory brought a degree of prosperity and enabled the construction stately country houses in the vicinity of the village (Le Bied, Vaudijon, La Mairesse, Cottendart, Sombacour).

In 1806, Colombier Castle was converted into a military hospital. Starting in 1824, it was used by the Federal militias as a parade ground and was converted into a barracks and given an expanded arsenal. In 1877 it became the official barracks of the 2. Division, which later became Field Division 2. In 2003, the Army XXI reforms dissolved the Division and in 2004 the barracks became an infantry training center.

In the 19th century, Colombier was a regional center, with a gas plant and a bank. The first train station was built in 1859–60. In 1892 it became part of the tram line Neuchâtel-Boudry and in 1927 an airfield was built in the municipality. The regional secondary school was built in the 1969 and teaches students from Colombier, Cortaillod, Boudry, Bôle, Rochefort and Auvernier. It is now a residential community, with few industries. Many of the jobs in town support the barracks.

<doc id="1175814" wikidata="Q258851" url="?curid=1175814" title="World Golf Hall of Fame">
<text>The World Golf Hall of Fame was, until recently, located at World Golf Village between Jacksonville, Florida and St. Augustine, Florida, in the United States. It is unusual amongst sports halls of fame in that a single site honored both men and women. It is supported by a consortium of 26 golf organizations from all over the world. It was moved back to Pinehurst, North Carolina, with the new campus opening in 2024.

The Hall of Fame Museum Building was designed by the specialist museum architecture firm E. Verner Johnson and Associates of Boston. They also produced the museum master plan that established the size, mission and qualities of the museum and the surrounding facilities and site.

The Hall of Fame Museum features a permanent exhibition and a rolling program of temporary exhibitions. Designed by museum design firm Ralph Appelbaum Associates, the Hall of Fame and exhibition area contains exhibits on the game&#x27;s history, heritage, and techniques; major players and organizations; golf course design, equipment, and dress.

==History==
The World Golf Hall of Fame is located in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and was originally privately operated by Diamondhead Corp., then owners of the Pinehurst Resort. It opened in September 1974 with an initial class of 13 members. Initially it was a local project, but the PGA of America took over management in 1983 and acquired full ownership in 1986.

Two other halls of fame have been merged into the World Golf Hall of Fame. The PGA of America established one in 1940, which was merged into the Pinehurst Hall in the 1980s. The Hall of Fame of Women&#x27;s Golf was established by the LPGA in 1951, with four charter members: Patty Berg, Betty Jameson, Louise Suggs, and Babe Zaharias. It was inactive for some years, but in 1967 it moved into its first physical premises, which were in Augusta, Georgia and was renamed the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame. In 1998 it merged into the World Golf Hall of Fame.

In 1994 the global golf industry established a non-profit making body called the World Golf Foundation to promote the sport, with the creation of an enhanced Hall of Fame as one of its main objectives. Construction at the new site in St. Johns County, Florida began in 1996 and the new facility opened on May 19, 1998, and closed in September, 2023.

The new USGA Pinehurst Golf House, now housing the hall of fame is scheduled to open in 2024.

==Membership categories==
In October 2013, the Hall announced that it was reviewing its selection process and that there would be no induction ceremony in 2014. A new process was announced in March 2014.

Starting in 2014, members were inducted into the Hall of Fame in one of four categories: Male Competitor, Female Competitor, Veterans, and Lifetime Achievement categories. Elections are held every other year with induction ceremonies in odd number years beginning in 2015. The process has changed from that used from 1996 to 2013. The minimum qualifications for male and female competitors are: minimum of 40 years old, or five years removed from &quot;active competition&quot; and 15 or more wins on &quot;approved tours&quot; or two &quot;major wins&quot;. The veterans category is primarily for those golfers whose careers ended before 1980 and includes both amateurs and professionals. The lifetime achievement category remains from the old system.

The Hall again revised the criteria in 2020 and now recognize two categories: Competitor and Contributor.

A 30-member nominating sub-committee composed of Hall of Fame members, World Golf Foundation Board organizations and members of the media will choose from among the eligible candidates and nominate a total of 10 individuals (four male competitors, four female competitors, and two contributors). A separate 20-member selection committee will then vote on all four ballots. Election to the Hall of Fame will require 75% of the vote and each year&#x27;s election class is limited to two from each ballot and five total.

In 2016, the Hall announced that the age requirement would be raised to 50 from 40 years old. In 2020, the age went from 50 to 45.

===Categories from 1996 to 2013===
From 1996 to 2013, members were inducted into the Hall of Fame in one of five categories: PGA Tour/Champions Tour, LPGA Tour, International, Lifetime Achievement, and Veterans.

====PGA Tour/Champions Tour ballot====
Current and former PGA Tour and Champions Tour players were eligible for this ballot if they met the following requirements (beginning with 1996 election):

*PGA Tour
**Minimum of 40 years old
**PGA Tour member for 10 years
**10 PGA Tour wins or two wins in the majors or Players Championship
*Champions Tour
**Champions Tour member for five years
**20 wins between PGA Tour and Champions Tour or five wins in the majors (regular or senior) or Players Championship

Election requirements:
Voters voted for up to 30% of the players on the ballot. If a player was named on less than 5% of the ballots for two consecutive years, they were dropped from the ballot. Players not elected could remain on the ballot indefinitely (prior to 2007 the limit was 10 years, from 2007 to 2009 the limit was 15 years).

====LPGA point system====
LPGA Tour golfers were eligible through a point system. Since 1999, LPGA members automatically qualified for World Golf Hall of Fame membership when they meet these three criteria:

#Must be/have been an &quot;active&quot; LPGA Tour member for 10 years.
#Must have won/been awarded at least one of the following – an LPGA major championship, the Vare Trophy or Player of the Year honors; and
#Must have accumulated a total of 27 points, which are awarded as follows – one point for each LPGA official tournament win, two points for each LPGA major tournament win and one point for each Vare Trophy or Rolex Player of the Year honor earned.

Before 1999, players had to win 30 tournaments, including two majors; 35 tournaments with one major; or 40 tournaments in all to automatically qualify. At one time, players had to win two &quot;different&quot; majors to qualify with 30 wins, but this was changed earlier in the 1990s.

This point system is still used for selection to the LPGA Hall of Fame. However, in March 2022, the ten-year requirement was scrapped, and a point for winning an Olympic gold medal was added to the criteria.

====International ballot====
Men and women golfers not fully eligible for PGA/Champions Tour ballot or the LPGA Tour point system were eligible for the International ballot if they met the following requirements (beginning with the 1996 election):

*Minimum of 40 years old
*Cumulative 50 points earned as follows:
**Men
***6 points – Major victories
***4 points – Players Championship win
***3 points – Other PGA Tour win, European Tour win
***2 points – Japan Golf Tour, Sunshine Tour, PGA Tour of Australasia, Champions Tour win
***1 point – Other national championship win; Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup participation
**Women
***6 points – Major victories
***4 points – Other LPGA Tour win, Women&#x27;s British Open win prior to 2001
***2 points – LPGA of Japan Tour win, Ladies European Tour win
***1 point – Other national championship win, Solheim Cup participation

Election requirements: same as PGA Tour ballot.

====Lifetime Achievement category====
There was also a &quot;lifetime achievement&quot; category through which anyone who had made a major contribution to the organization or promotion of the sport may be selected, for example, Bob Hope. These members were chosen by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Board of Directors. Most played golf, in some cases with some competitive success, but it was not their play alone which won them a place in the Hall of Fame.

====Veteran&#x27;s category====
The last category was created to honor professional or amateur players whose career concluded at least 30 years ago. These members were also chosen by the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Board of Directors.

==Membership==
New members are inducted each year on the Monday before The Players Championship (previous to 2010 in October or November), and by May 2013 there were 146 members. Beginning in 2010, the ballots are due in July with the results announced later in the year. New entrants in the Lifetime Achievement and Veteran&#x27;s categories are announced at irregular intervals. For example, Frank Chirkinian was elected in the Lifetime Achievement category in an emergency election in February 2011, with the vote presumably held because he was then terminally ill with lung cancer; when it became clear he would not live to attend his induction, he videotaped his acceptance speech in late February, less than two weeks before his death.

=== Men ===
Unless stated otherwise these men were inducted mainly for their on-course success. The exceptions mostly correspond with the lifetime achievement category, but not quite. For example, Charlie Sifford was notable as a player but was inducted for lifetime achievement.

<text>Richard Cassels (1690 – 1751), also known as Richard Castle, was an architect who ranks with Edward Lovett Pearce as one of the greatest architects working in Ireland in the 18th century. Cassels was born in 1690 in Kassel, Germany. Although German, his family were of French origin and descended from the French-Netherlandish &#x27;Du Ry&#x27; family, famous for the many architects among their number. A cousin Simon Louis du Ry designed Schloss Wilhelmshöhe in Kassel.

== Early work ==
Richard Cassels, who originally trained as an engineer, came to Ireland in 1728 at the behest of Sir Gustavus Hume of County Fermanagh to design for Hume a mansion on the shores of Lower Lough Erne. Hume had probably discovered Cassels working in London where he was influenced by the circle of architects influenced by Lord Burlington. Cassels, soon after arrival in Ireland, established a thriving architectural practice in Dublin. Architecturally at the time Dublin was an exciting place to be – Edward Lovett Pearce, also newly established in the city, was working on Castletown House, the great mansion of Speaker William Conolly, and the new Irish Houses of Parliament simultaneously. Both of these buildings were designed in the newly introduced Palladian style. Palladian architecture was currently enjoying a revival that was to sweep across Europe and be adopted with fervour in Ireland. Cassels was well versed in the concepts of Palladio and Vitruvius, but was also sympathetic to the more Baroque style of architecture.

In Dublin itself, Cassels worked on the Houses of Parliament with Pearce, his mentor and friend. Cassels&#x27; first solo commission was The Printing House of Trinity College, designed to resemble a temple complete with a doric portico. This portico was an interesting feature symbolising Cassels&#x27; early work – a portico is an almost essential feature of Palladian architecture. But as Cassels&#x27; work matured he tended to merely hint at a portico by placing semi-engaged columns supporting a pediment as the focal point of a facade. Perhaps he felt the huge Italian porticos that provided shelter from the sun were not requisite for houses in the less clement Ireland. This blind, merely suggested, portico is a feature of his final Dublin masterpiece Kildare House (later renamed Leinster House), built for The 20th Earl of Kildare (later created The 1st Duke of Leinster) between 1745 and 1751. In 1741 he designed the Bishop&#x27;s Palace which is now part of Waterford Treasures - Three Museums in the Viking Triangle, Waterford, Ireland. A comparison of the Printing House and Leinster House shows the evolution from the true Palladian style to the, commonly referred, Georgian style in Ireland during the quarter-century that Dublin was to be almost rebuilt.

The untimely death of Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, aged 34, in 1733, made Cassels Ireland&#x27;s leading architect working in the sought-after Palladian style. He immediately assumed all of Pearce&#x27;s commissions and thus began designing a series of lavish country houses. Following the completion of the Houses of Parliament, there seemed to have been a rush by the aristocracy to build a series of new townhouses in the same style and Cassels was often the first choice for architect. This led to the creation of what came to be known as Georgian Dublin.

For his exteriors, he used a Palladian style that was distinctive for its strength and sobriety. In this, he seems to have been influenced by Pearce and also James Gibbs. However, when it came to interiors, Cassels gave full rein to his love of the more continental Baroque. Walls were covered in stucco reliefs, ceilings medallions and motifs of plaster, segmental mouldings, and carvings, in an almost rococo style peculiar to Ireland.

== Notable works ==
Some of the finest of Cassels works in order of commencement are listed below.
(&quot;Dates often vary from one source to the other&quot;)

===Summerhill House (1731)===
Summerhill House was a vast Palladian mansion in County Meath originally designed by Pearce, who died before the project was commenced. Cassels took over the project and was responsible for the rococo interiors. The building was damaged by fire in the 1920s and finally demolished in the 1970s.

=== Westport House, Mayo (1731) ===
Built for Browne in 1730, Westport House is a beautifully sited two-storey over basement ashlar stone house overlooking Clew Bay in County Mayo. Cassels decided to relocate the village of Westport to improve the outlook from the house to the east. The original house was quite small and was later extended by others.

=== Trinity College, The Printing House (1734) ===

This perfect small doric temple, was completed in 1734 and is thought to be Cassels&#x27; first major solo work. A four-columned portico of Doric columns projected from the rusticated severe building and the entirety is only the width of the portico. (&quot;This building is sometimes attributed to Edward Lovett Pearce&quot;).

=== Carton House (1739) ===
Cassels made large alterations to the Carton house in County Kildare between 1739 and 1745 for the Earl of Kildare. The resultant facades were in his usual restrained and symmetrical style. The great garden facade is terminated by Venetian windows at each end, while in the centre, a single-storey portico is so unostentatious as to be almost a porch. The roofline is hidden by a balustrade, broken by an unsupported pediment over the central bay. The interiors are a riot of plaster-work ornamentation. The Lafranchini brothers, famous for their plaster work, executed some of their finest work here, and would work again with Cassels at Russborough.

=== The Conolly Folly (1740) ===
The Conolly Folly was designed by him, and built in 1740 as a park ornament for Castletown House.

=== Tyrone House, Dublin (1740) ===

Cassels designed this Dublin townhouse for Marcus Beresford, Earl of Tyrone, in Marlborough Street between 1740 and 1745. Smaller than Powerscourt House it is said to be the first substantial aristocratic house to be built in the north of the city. It is a fine example of Cassels&#x27; robust sober style. The central Venetian window above the principal entrance is the sole example of decoration or flamboyance in this dramatically severe facade.

=== Russborough House (1742) ===
Russborough was designed by Cassels for Joseph Leeson, 1st Earl of Milltown. It was built between 1741 and 1755. A central block containing the principal rooms is flanked by curved and segmented colonnades leading to two symmetrical service blocks. The main entrance, at the centre of one of Cassels&#x27;s trademark &#x27;suggested&#x27; porticoes, is on a raised piano nobile. It is reached by a broad flight of steps. The principal feature of the interiors are the rococo plaster-work and the ceilings, again by the master stuccoists Paul and Philip Lanfrachini; and ornate carved marble fireplaces, all contrasting with the austerity of the exterior.

=== Powerscourt House (1741) ===
Powerscourt House, Wicklow, was a large country house, originally a 13th-century castle, which was completely rebuilt by Cassels, starting in 1730 and finishing in 1741. The demesne was approximately . The three-story house had at least 68 rooms. The entrance hall was long and wide where family heirlooms were displayed. The main reception rooms were on the first floor rather than more typically on the ground floor. King George IV was the guest of Richard Wingfield, 5th Viscount Powerscourt in August 1821. Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt inherited the title and the Powerscourt estate, which comprised of land in Ireland, at the age of 8 in 1844. When he reached the age of 21 he embarked on an extensive renovation of the house and created new gardens. Inspiration for the garden design followed visits by Powerscourt to ornamental gardens at the Palace of Versailles, Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna and Schwetzingen Palace near uHeidelberg. The garden development took 20 years to complete in 1880. On a commanding hilltop position, Cassels deviated slightly from his usual sombre style, to give the house something of what John Vanbrugh would have called the &#x27;castle air&#x27; – a severe Palladian facade terminated by two circular domed towers. The house was destroyed by fire in 1974 when it was owned by the Slazenger family and renovated in 1996. In the 1830s, the house was the venue for a number of conferences on unfulfilled Bible prophecies, which were attended by men such as John Nelson Darby and Edward Irving. These conferences were held under the auspices of Theodosia Wingfield Powerscourt, then the widow Lady Powerscourt.

=== Leinster House (1745) ===
The house was originally known as Kildare House after James Fitzgerald, the Earl of Kildare, who commissioned Cassels to build it between 1745 and 1747. Intended to be Dublin&#x27;s grandest mansion, the result could not have disappointed Kildare. It is said that another Irish architect, James Hoban, later copied the facade of Leinster house for his design of the White House in Washington (although Castlecoole designed by James Wyatt bears a closer resemblance). Cassels name appears on the foundation stone of Leinster House, showing the esteem in which he was held. 

=== Rotunda Hospital (1757) ===
Originally the main maternity hospital for Dublin, it was redesigned by Cassels who transformed it into a Palladian palace, complete with a rotunda which gives the hospital its name.

=== Waterstown House, Westmeath ===
Built for Gustavus Handcock-Temple in the 1740s, the house which was three stories over the basement and 7 bays wide, was built of brick with stone facing. Cassels work includes a pigeon house (which is almost identical to the Killiney Hill obelisk), walled gardens, a farmyard, and a grotto. The front facade was 7 bays wide and 3 storeys high over a basement. The house was abandoned in 1923. It was sold for scrap in 1928 at which time most of the house was dismantled.

== Legacy to Ireland ==
Richard Cassels died suddenly in 1751 while at Carton House. He gave Ireland a distinctive type of Palladianism, to appreciate which one has to consider the buildings both externally and internally: the restrained, even severe, but nevertheless, grand external façades, which do not jar the eye in the Irish landscape, give no hint of the flamboyant rococo exuberance within.

<text>USS &quot;Stromboli&quot; was a bomb brig of the United States Navy used in the Mexican–American War.

In 1846, the United States Navy purchased the brig &quot;Howard&quot; at Boston, Massachusetts to strengthen its forces for the Mexican–American War. Commissioned on 18 March 1847 &quot;Stromboli&quot;, named for the island of Stromboli in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the ship sailed for the Gulf of Mexico under the command of Commander William S. Walker.

&quot;Stromboli&quot; performed blockade duty in the Bay of Campeche, especially off the mouth of the Coatzacoalcos River. In mid-June, she sailed to the mouth of the Tabasco River. On 14 June, she and were towed across the bar into the river as Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry&#x27;s squadron occupied Frontera. The force then moved upstream and took Tabasco the following day.

&quot;Stromboli&quot; later returned to blockade duty off the mouth of the Coatzacoalcos. That summer, the ship&#x27;s crew was stricken by yellow fever, but she continued to help guard the U.S. Army water communications through the winter and spring.

In July 1848, &quot;Stromboli&quot; sailed home, and she was decommissioned on 6 September 1848. She was sold later that year.

<text>János Bihari (21 October 1764 – 26 April 1827) was an influential Hungarian Romani violinist. He is one of the founders of Romani academic music and the musical genre verbunkos.

By the middle of the nineteenth century, &quot;Gypsy music&quot; was elevated to high fashion, the first great was that of János Bihari, the pianist Franz Liszt described: &quot;The tones sung by his magic violin flow on our enchanted ears like the tears...&quot;.

==Biography==
Bihari was born into a Romani family in Nagyabony, Hungary (today Veľké Blahovo, Slovakia); his father was a violinist. In 1801, living in Pest, Bihari created an orchestra of 1 cimbalomist and 4 violinists. This orchestra became popular soon and visited with Bihari many towns in Hungary and abroad. In every country Bihari learnt local folk and academic music and arranged it to play during his performances. Bihari was so popular that he could live like a noble man: he had expensive clothes and a servant who held Bihari&#x27;s violin, he stayed in luxurious hotels, etc. He was also invited to play for the Emperor of Austria.

Bihari&#x27;s melodies were used by such composers as Franz Liszt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Pablo de Sarasate and others.

In 1824 Bihari injured his left hand, thus impairing his ability to perform. Subsequently, his popularity declined, and he died in poverty in Pest.

Bihari left 84 musical compositions that are considered to be classic.

<text>Illapel () is a Chilean city, which is the capital of the Choapa Province, Coquimbo Region. It lies along the Illapel River and marks the country&#x27;s narrowest point along a parallel (94 km). It is located to the east of Los Vilos.

==Administration==
As a commune, Illapel is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008–2012 alcalde was Denis Cortés Vargas (IND/JPM).

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Illapel is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Adriana Muñoz (PDC) and Luis Lemus (Ind.) as part of the 9th electoral district, (together with Combarbalá, Punitaqui, Monte Patria, Salamanca, Los Vilos, Canela). The commune is represented in the Senate by Evelyn Matthei Fornet (UDI) and Jorge Pizarro Soto (PDC) as part of the 4th senatorial constituency (Coquimbo Region).

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Illapel spans an area of and has 30,355 inhabitants (14,940 men and 15,415 women). Of these, 21,826 (71.9%) lived in urban areas and 8,529 (28.1%) in rural areas. The population grew by 4.6% (1,348 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

==Earthquake of September 16, 2015==

On September 16, 2015, at 22:54:33 UTC (19:54:33 local time), a great earthquake of magnitude 8.3 hit the area, with an epicenter west of Illapel. The earthquake caused physical damage, the loss of human lives, forced the evacuation of one million people from the coast (some sources mistakenly claimed a million people evacuated from Santiago), and a tsunami warning was issued for parts of South America, Hawaii, California and French Polynesia. Copper prices spiked in early trading, on fears of supply disruption.

<doc id="1175839" wikidata="Q1641400" url="?curid=1175839" title="Lichen sclerosus">
<text>Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment.

==Signs and symptoms==

LS can occur without symptoms. White patches on the LS body area, itching, pain, dyspareunia (in genital LS), easier bruising, cracking, tearing and peeling, as well as hyperkeratosis, are common symptoms in both men and women. In women, the condition most commonly occurs on the vulva and around the anus with ivory-white elevations that may be flat and glistening.

In males, the disease may take the form of whitish patches on the foreskin and its narrowing (preputial stenosis), forming an &quot;indurated ring&quot;, which can make retraction more difficult or impossible (phimosis). In addition there can be lesions, white patches or reddening on the glans. In contrast to women, anal involvement is less frequent. Meatal stenosis, making it more difficult or even impossible to urinate, may also occur.

On the non-genital skin, the disease may manifest as porcelain-white spots with small visible plugs inside the orifices of hair follicles or sweat glands on the surface. Thinning of the skin may also occur.

===Psychological effect===
Distress due to the discomfort and pain of lichen sclerosus is normal, as are concerns with self-esteem and sex. Counseling can help.

According to the US National Vulvodynia Association, which also supports women with lichen sclerosus, vulvo-vaginal conditions can cause feelings of isolation, hopelessness, low self-image, and much more. Some women are unable to continue working or have sexual relations, and may be limited in other physical activities. Depression, anxiety, and even anger are all normal responses to the ongoing pain LS sufferers experience.

==Pathophysiology==
Although it is not clear what causes LS, several theories have been postulated. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious and cannot be caught from another person.

Several risk factors have been proposed, including exposure to the irritant effects of urine, autoimmune diseases, infections and genetic predisposition. There is evidence that LS can be associated with thyroid disease.

=== Exposure to urine ===
There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that prolonged exposure of susceptible tissues to the irritant effects of urine may contribute to the development of lichen sclerosus.

Urine droplets that leak after urination can become trapped in the external genitalia (e.g., beneath the foreskin), creating an occluded environment that exacerbates irritation and inflammation.

Several observations support the &quot;urine occlusion hypothesis,&quot; including:

* Rare incidence in circumcised individuals: Lichen sclerosus is extremely rare in individuals circumcised during childhood.
* Resolution through circumcision: In affected men, lichen sclerosus can be effectively treated or cured by circumcision.
* Recurrence with neo-foreskin formation: In circumcised men who later develop a neo-foreskin over time, the disease can reappear. 
* Pattern of distribution: The typical distribution of lichen sclerosus corresponds to areas exposed to urine. In men, the condition is usually confined beneath the foreskin, while in women, it can involve the perianal region.
* Lichen sclerosus in urine-diverted sites: When urine is diverted to other areas of the body, the skin in those regions can also develop lichen sclerosus.

===Genetic===
Lichen sclerosus may have a genetic component. A high correlation of lichen sclerosus has been reported between twins and between family members.

===Autoimmunity===
Autoimmunity is a process in which the body fails to recognize itself and therefore attacks its own cells and tissue. Specific antibodies have been found in LS sufferers. Furthermore, there seems to be a higher prevalence of other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus type 1, vitiligo, alopecia areata, and thyroid disease.

===Infection===
Both bacterial and viral pathogens have been implicated in the etiology of LS. A disease that is similar to LS, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is caused by the spirochete &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;. Viral involvement of HPV and hepatitis C are also suspected.

A link with Lyme disease is shown by the presence of &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot; in LSA biopsy tissue.

===Hormones===
Since LS in females is primarily found in women with a low estrogen state (prepubertal and postmenopausal women), hormonal influences have been postulated. To date though, very little evidence has been found to support that theory.

===Local skin changes===
Some findings suggest that LS can be initiated through scarring or radiation, although those findings were sporadic and very uncommon.

==Diagnosis==
The disease often goes undiagnosed for several years, because it is sometimes not recognized, and misdiagnosed as thrush or other problems, and not correctly diagnosed until the patient is referred to a specialist after the problem does not clear up.

A biopsy of the affected skin can be done to confirm a diagnosis. When a biopsy is done, hyperkeratosis, atrophic epidermis, sclerosis of dermis and lymphocyte activity in dermis are histological findings associated with LS. The biopsies are also checked for signs of dysplasia.

It has been noted that clinical diagnosis of balanitis xerotica obliterans can be &quot;almost unmistakable,&quot; though there are other dermatologic conditions such as lichen planus, localized scleroderma, leukoplakia, vitiligo, and the cutaneous rash of Lyme disease can have a similar appearance.

==Treatment==
===Main treatment===
There is no definitive cure for LS. Behavior change is part of treatment. The patient should minimize or, preferably, stop scratching LS-affected skin. Any scratching, stress or damage to the skin can worsen the disease. Scratching has been theorized to increase cancer risks. Furthermore, the patient should wear comfortable clothes and avoid tight clothing, as it is a major factor in the severity of symptoms in some cases.

Corticosteroids applied topically to the LS-affected skin are the first-line treatment for lichen sclerosus in both women and men, with strong evidence showing that they are &quot;safe and effective&quot; when appropriately applied, even over long courses of treatment, rarely causing serious adverse effects. They improve or suppress all symptoms for some time, with high variance across patients, until it is required to use them again. Methylprednisolone aceponate has been used as a safe and effective corticosteroid for mild and moderate cases. For severe cases, it has been theorized that mometasone furoate might be safer and more effective than clobetasol. Recent studies have shown that topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus can have an effect similar to corticosteroids, but its effects on cancer risks with LS are not conclusively known. Based on limited evidence, a 2011 Cochrane review concluded that clobetasol propionate, mometasone furoate, and pimecrolimus (calcineurin inhibitor) all are effective therapies in treating genital lichen sclerosus. However, randomized-controlled trials are needed to further identify the optimal potency and regimen of topical corticosteroids, and assess the duration of remission and/or the prevention of flares patients experience with these topical therapies.

Continuous use of appropriate doses of topical corticosteroids is required to ensure symptoms remain relieved over the patient&#x27;s life time. If continuously used, corticosteroids have been suggested to minimize the risk of cancer in various studies. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 507 women throughout six years, cancer occurred for 4.7% of patients who were only &quot;partially compliant&quot; with corticosteroid treatment, while it occurred in 0% of cases where they were &quot;fully compliant&quot;. In a second study, of 129 patients, cancer occurred in 11% of patients, none of whom were fully compliant with corticosteroid treatment. Both those studies, however, also said that a corticosteroid as powerful as clobetasol is not necessary in most cases. In a prospective study of 83 patients, throughout 20 years, eight developed cancer. Six already had cancer at presentation and had not had treatment, while the other two were not taking corticosteroids often enough. In all three studies, every single cancer case observed occurred in patients who were not taking corticosteroids as often as the study recommended.

Continuous, abundant usage of emollients topically applied to the LS-affected skin is recommended to improve symptoms. They can supplement, but not replace, corticosteroid therapy. They can be used much more frequently than corticosteroids due to the extreme rarity of serious adverse effects. With genital LS, appropriate lubrication should always be used before and during sex in order to avoid pain and the worsening the disease. Some oils, such as olive oil and coconut oil, can be used to accomplish both the emollient and sexual lubrication function.

In males, it has been reported that circumcision can have positive effects, but does not necessarily prevent further flare-ups of the disease and does not protect against the possibility of cancer. Circumcision does not prevent or cure LS. In fact, &quot;balanitis xerotica obliterans&quot; in men was first reported by Stühmer in 1928. as a condition affecting a set of circumcised men.

===Other treatments===
Carbon dioxide laser treatment is safe and effective, and improves symptoms over the long term, but it does not lower cancer risks.

Platelet-rich plasma was reported to be effective in one study, producing large improvements in the patients&#x27; quality of life, with an average IGA improvement of 2.04 and DLQI improvement of 7.73.

==Prognosis==
The disease can last for a considerably long time. Occasionally, &quot;spontaneous cure&quot; may occur, particularly in young girls.

Lichen sclerosus is associated with a higher risk of cancer. Skin that has been scarred as a result of lichen sclerosus is more likely to develop skin cancer. Women with lichen sclerosus may develop vulvar carcinoma. Lichen sclerosus is associated with from 3 to 7% of all cases of vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. In women, it has been reported that 33.6 times higher vulvar cancer risk is associated with LS. A study in men noted that: &quot;the reported incidence of penile carcinoma in patients with balanitis xerotica obliterans is 2.6–5.8%&quot;.

==Epidemiology==
There is a bimodal age distribution in the incidence of LS in women. It occurs in females with an average age of diagnosis of 7.6 years in girls and 60 years old in women. The average age of diagnosis in boys is from 9 to 11 years old.

In men, the most common age of incidence is 21 to 30.

==History==
In 1875, Weir reported what was possible vulvar or oral LS was &quot;ichthyosis.&quot; In 1885, Breisky described kraurosis vulvae. In 1887, Hallopeau described a series of extragenital cases of LS. In 1892, Darier formally described the classic histopathology of LS. In 1900, the concept was formed that scleroderma and LS were closely related, which continues to this day. In 1901, pediatric LS was described. From 1913 to present, the concept that scleroderma is not closely related to LS also was formed. In 1920, Taussig established vulvectomy as the treatment of choice for kraurosis vulvae, a premalignant condition. In 1927, Kyrle defined LS (&quot;white spot disease&quot;) as an entity sui generis. In 1928, Stühmer described balanitis xerotica obliterans as a postcircumcision phenomenon. In 1936, retinoids (vitamin A) were used to treat LS. In 1945, testosterone was used in genital LS. In 1961, the use of corticosteroids started. Jeffcoate presented an argument against vulvectomy for simple LS. In 1971, progesterone was used in LS. Wallace defined clinical factors and the epidemiology of LS. In 1976, Friedrich defined LS as a dystrophic and not an atrophic condition, and &quot;et atrophicus&quot; was dropped. The International Society for Study of Vulvar Disease classification system established that &quot;kraurosis&quot; and &quot;leukoplakia&quot; were no longer to be used. In 1980, fluorinated and superpotent steroids were first used to treat LS. In 1981, studies into HLA serotypes and LS were published. In 1984, etretinate and acetretin were used in LS. In 1987, LS was linked with Borrelia infection.

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus was first described in 1887 by François Henri Hallopeau. Since not all cases of lichen sclerosus exhibit atrophic tissue, the use of &quot;et atrophicus&quot; was dropped in 1976 by the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD), officially proclaiming the name &quot;lichen sclerosus&quot;.

<doc id="1175842" wikidata="Q681339" url="?curid=1175842" title="HMAS Perth (D 38)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; (D 38) was the lead ship of the guided missile destroyers operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built in the United States to a modified version of the &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot; design, &quot;Perth&quot; entered service with the RAN in 1965.

The destroyer made three deployments to the Vietnam War, earning a RAN battle honour and two United States Navy commendations for her service. The majority of the ship&#x27;s career was spent on training exercises and goodwill visits to other nations, with one deployment as far as the Mediterranean. &quot;Perth&quot; was decommissioned in 1999, and sunk as a dive wreck off the coast of Western Australia in 2001.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Perth&quot; was the lead ship of three guided missile destroyers built for the RAN. Based on the United States Navy&#x27;s , &quot;Perth&quot; had a displacement of 3,370 tons at standard load, and 4,618 tons at full load, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion was provided by four Foster Wheeler boilers feeding two General Electric turbines, which provided to the destroyer&#x27;s two propeller shafts. &quot;Perth&quot; could achieve speeds of . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 22 officers and 311 sailors.

As a guided missile destroyer, &quot;Perth&quot;″s main armament consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher firing Tartar missiles. This was supplemented by two 5&quot;/54 caliber Mark 42 guns and two Mark 32 triple torpedo tube sets. Over the course of the ship&#x27;s career, two Ikara anti-submarine missile launchers were installed during a refit in 1966–67, then removed in 1991, the Mark 13 launcher was modified to fire Standard missiles, and two Phalanx CIWS units were installed.

&quot;Perth&quot; was laid down at the Defoe Shipbuilding Company shipyard in Bay City, Michigan, on 21 September 1962. She was launched on 26 September 1963 by the wife of Howard Beale, the Australian Ambassador to the United States. &quot;Perth&quot; was completed on 22 May 1965, having cost $45 million to construct, and was commissioned into the RAN on 17 July. During the month leading up to the commissioning, the ship&#x27;s company volunteered to help create hiking trails in the forests of Rhode Island&#x27;s George Washington Management Area. The destroyer spent eight months in American waters on trials and exercises before sailing for her namesake city, via Pearl Harbor and Suva, on 12 February 1966. During construction, the ship was assigned the United States Navy hull number DDG-25.

==Operational history==
In April 1967, &quot;Perth&quot; was ordered to Macquarie Island to rescue a seriously ill researcher. The ship arrived without incident, but conditions at the island were so adverse to boat handling that instead, the ship&#x27;s diver swam ashore and back towing a liferaft.

===Vietnam deployments===

During the mid-1960s, the United States government pressured Australia to increase the resources it was committing to the Vietnam War; one of the requests was for a combat vessel to help the USN meet the demand for naval gunfire support operations. The idea of deploying a RAN combat ship to the Vietnam War was initially hampered by the number of ships available, particularly with commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve and involvement in the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, along with the difficulty of operating and maintaining British-designed ships with USN resources. On 14 December 1966, the Australian Cabinet approved the deployment of &quot;Hobart&quot; as part of increases to Australian military commitment to the conflict. Destroyers deployed to the Vietnam theatre generally operated in one of four roles:
* Patrols along the coast of North Vietnam as part of Operation Sea Dragon to interdict coastal shipping, with secondary attacks on inland supply lines and military targets, along with coastal defence sites that had fired on American and Australian ships. Ships assigned to Sea Dragon were normally split into a northern and southern unit (although during 1967 up to four units were operating at any time), with each unit made up of two to three ships. However, the Australian government forbade RAN vessels from operating in the northern area.
* Naval gunfire support operations to assist ground forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps units operating closest to the North Vietnam border. Seven ships were usually stationed on the &#x27;gunline&#x27;, and attacks fell into two categories: &#x27;unspotted&#x27; shelling of areas where North Vietnamese or Viet Cong forces and facilities were known or believed to be, and &#x27;spotted&#x27; fire missions in direct support of ground troops. In this role, &quot;Perth&quot; operated under the callsign &quot;Gunpowder&quot;.
* Anti-infiltration operations under Operation Market Time, which aimed to stop the logistic supply and reinforcement of Viet Cong units operating in South Vietnam by tracking, intercepting, and searching coastal shipping. RAN destroyers were never formally assigned to Market Time, but the overlap of the gunline and Market Time operational areas meant the ships were often called on to assist by tracking suspicious ships or participating in raids.
* Escort of USN aircraft carriers involved in Operation Rolling Thunder airstrikes.
Although RAN ships on deployment were expected to fulfil all duties of an equivalent American destroyer, they were forbidden by the Australian government from operating outside the Vietnam theatre on unrelated Seventh Fleet duties (such as the Taiwan Patrol Force, guard ship duties at Hong Kong, or the Space Recovery Program). After the invasion of Cambodia in 1970, RAN ships were also prohibited from entering Cambodian waters.

While deployed to Vietnam, the destroyers were placed under the administrative control of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam in addition to that of the Flag Officer Commanding Australian Fleet. Operationally, the RAN vessels were under the command of the United States Seventh Fleet. Arrangements were made to provide logistic support through the United States Pacific Fleet. A USN lieutenant was assigned to each ship during deployments to act as a liaison with the Seventh Fleet. The deployment of in March 1967 began a pattern of six-month deployments for RAN destroyers, with a constant RAN presence with the Seventh Fleet. Australia was the only allied nation to provide naval support to the United States Navy during the Vietnam War.

====First deployment====
On 14 September 1967, Vietnam duties were handed to &quot;Perth&quot; by &quot;Hobart&quot;. The destroyer&#x27;s first assignment was the gunline off the II Corps operating area, where &quot;Perth&quot; rendezvoused with on 26 September. The ship was specifically tasked with providing gunfire support for the 1st Cavalry Division of the United States Army, which was involved in Operation Pershing. Three days later, &quot;Perth&quot; was reassigned to the northern part of South Vietnam, in response to increased North Vietnamese activity. On 2 October, both turrets broke down; both were repaired by 23:00, but the aft turret failed again the next evening, with the new problem beyond repair until replacement parts were air-dropped on 5 October. &quot;Perth&quot; was redeployed to Sea Dragon operations on 16 October, joining American cruiser . On the morning of 18 October, the destroyer was fired on by coastal artillery while investigating a group of fishing junks; &quot;Perth&quot; was hit once, with the shell deflecting off the aft gun turret and penetrating the superstructure to start a fire in the confidential books vault. The gun turret captain was later awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his actions in response to the attack, while the officer of the watch was mentioned in despatches for courage and calmness under fire. Six days later, &quot;Perth&quot; and fired on six small supply craft, sinking five.

&quot;Perth&quot; sailed to Subic for emergency maintenance and rebarrelling on 26 October, and returned to Sea Dragon duties on 1 November. Another maintenance period occurred between 7 and 16 November, after which &quot;Perth&quot; sailed to Singapore for shore leave, returning to operations on 27 November. This gunline deployment lasted until 20 December, with &quot;Perth&quot; coming under shore battery fire on two occasions, but receiving no hits or damage. After maintenance at Subic, the destroyer returned Sea Dragon operations on 9 January. Problems with the forward gun turret and the starboard propeller saw &quot;Perth&quot; withdraw to Subic for repairs on 2 February. These were completed by 14 February, with the destroyer returning to the Sea Dragon force that day. The commanding officer of &quot;Perth&quot; was appointed overall commander of both the northern and southern task units; the northern unit was normally led by the commander of the assigned cruiser, but &quot;Newport News&quot; was in dock for maintenance. In mid-February, the forward gun mount malfunctioned again, which left the turret operational but unable to rotate. On 1 March, the destroyer withdrew for maintenance, returning to operations ten days later. On 23 March, &quot;Perth&quot; withdrew to Subic to conclude her tour of duty, and was replaced on 31 March by &quot;Hobart&quot;.

The destroyer was awarded the United States Navy Unit Commendation for her service during the deployment. In addition to the two personnel awards for actions in response to the 18 October hit, &quot;Perth&quot;″s commanding officer was Mentioned in Despatches, and 22 personnel received Naval Board commendations.

====Second deployment====
On 19 September 1968, &quot;Perth&quot; departed from Sydney to replace &quot;Hobart&quot; in the Vietnam warzone. En route, a training exercise with RAAF aircraft revealed that one of the radars and both identification-friend-or-foe units had defects, which were repaired in Subic. &quot;Perth&quot; relieved her sister ship on 29 September, and after exercising with the Seventh Fleet, deployed to the gunline on 5 October. Four days later, the destroyer sailed north to relieve as leader of the northern Sea Dragon unit, as that destroyer was experiencing faults with her gun turrets and targeting computer. The next day, &quot;Perth&quot; and were joined by the battleship , with the battleship taking command of the unit and the Australian destroyer was reassigned back to the southern force. On 21 October, a day after rejoining the northern Sea Dragon unit, the destroyer observed the return of 14 North Vietnamese prisoners-of-war.

Two days later, a failure of the counter-recoil mechanism in the forward turret forced &quot;Perth&quot; to withdraw from Sea Dragon and sail south to less-demanding gunline duties of Danang. She remained on station until November, when she sailed to Hong Kong for personnel leave. Operation Sea Dragon was cancelled completely on 1 November. The ship was assigned to the II Corps area on 12 November, providing gunfire support for a battalion of the Korean 26th Regiment, then later relocated south to the IV Corps area to provide similar services for the South Vietnamese 7th and 9th Divisions. &quot;Perth&quot; returned to the gunline off Danang on 12 December, sailed back to the IV Corps area four days later, then effectively turned around on arrival as the ship was ordered to sail to the II Corps area and provide gunfire support for Operation McLain; firing 511 rounds in one day. On 19 December, &quot;Perth&quot; sailed back to IV Corps, where, apart from a brief deployment to Taiwan at the start of 1969, she remained until 20 January. The destroyer was assigned to the destroyer screen of the aircraft carrier for ten days, sailed to Subic for maintenance on 7 February, then returned to naval gunfire support duties on 22 February. From 25 to 28 February, the ship operated in support of Operation Victory Dragon VIII, and fired 690 shells at a variety of targets. &quot;Perth&quot; continued on fire support operations until 16 March, when she sailed to Hong Kong.

&quot;Perth&quot; was awarded the United States Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation for the second deployment. An appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, two Mentions in Despatches, and 25 Naval Board commendations recognised the achievements of individual personnel during the tour of duty.

====Third deployment====
&quot;Perth&quot;″s third and final tour of duty in Vietnamese waters began on the ship&#x27;s arrival in Subic on 26 September 1970. After relieving &quot;Hobart&quot; and completing work-up trials, the destroyer arrived off Danang on 3 October and took up gunline duties in Military Region 1. On 23 October, the ship supported a United States Navy SEALs; although two commando teams were able to infiltrate the Cua Viet River, the operation was inconclusive. On 26 October, &quot;Perth&quot; sailed to Subic for maintenance and rebarrelling, and returned to gunline operations on 4 November. On 14 November, both gun turrets became unusable, although the aft turret was restored later that day. Two days later, the ship sailed south to Military Region 3. On 2 December, the destroyer moved further south to Military Region 4. &quot;Perth&quot; sailed to Hong Kong for shore leave on 22 December.

The Australian warship returned to duties on 10 January with a five-day stint at Yankee Station, escorting the carrier during Rolling Thunder operations. &quot;Perth&quot; was then assigned to the gunline at Military Region 4. The forward gun turret became unusable again during the latter part of January, and the destroyer sailed to Bangkok for leave on 2 February, then Subic for maintenance and repairs. The ship returned to service on 22 February, operating across Military Regions 2 and 3. There was minimal activity when operating off Military Region 3, as the presence of a gunfire support vessel was unexpected, thus no pre-planned fire missions had been made. &quot;Perth&quot; left the gunline for the final time on 7 March, and was attached to the escort group of . Five days later, she sailed to Hong Kong, then Subic, to conclude her Vietnam deployment. The destroyer was relieved by on 29 March. Personnel awards for the deployment included one appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire, two instances of Mentioned in Despatches, and 26 Naval Board commendations.

During 1971, the Australian government decided to withdraw all forces from Vietnam by the end of the year; &quot;Brisbane&quot; was the last ship to make a combat deployment to Vietnam, and was not replaced when this deployment ended in September. &quot;Perth&quot; was awarded the battle honour &quot;Vietnam 1967–71&quot; for her three deployments.

===1970s===
In February 1973, &quot;Perth&quot;, , and sailed on a goodwill cruise to ports in Africa. On 31 July 1974, the destroyer sailed to Long Beach, California, for a modernisation and refit. Returning to Sydney on 25 September 1975, &quot;Perth&quot; spent most of the next two years on training exercises. At the end of March 1980, the destroyer undertook a two-month Pacific deployment to train with the United States Navy and other navies. From late September to early October, &quot;Perth&quot; was involved in Tuvalu&#x27;s independence celebrations, before sailing to Hawaii for naval exercises.

===1980s===

During early 1980, the destroyer&#x27;s propulsion system was modified to operate on diesel fuel instead of furnace oil. The upgrade was finished in May, and during July, &quot;Perth&quot; was involved in a disaster relief exercise at Jervis Bay. On 8 September 1980, &quot;Perth&quot; joined five other RAN vessels to form the Australia Squadron. The Squadron, a carrier group formed around the RAN flagship , also included , , &quot;Supply&quot;, and , and spent two months in the Indian Ocean as part of a flag-showing cruise; the largest RAN deployment since World War II.

At the start of 1981, after returning to Sydney for a five-week break, &quot;Perth&quot; returned to the Indian Ocean for another, four-and-a-half-month-long deployment. The cruise included numerous port visits and three crossing the line ceremonies. Later in the year, she participated in Exercise Kangaroo 81. In March 1982, the destroyer was deployed to the Indian Ocean for the third time, this time for five months. &quot;Perth&quot; was docked in Sydney for refit between April 1983 and July 1984, and spent the rest of the year on training exercises. In 1985, following the cancellation of ANZUS exercises after New Zealand withdrew from the treaty, &quot;Perth&quot; participated in their replacement, Exercise Flying Fish. Later in the year, she was deployed to South-east Asia, before returning to Sydney for maintenance and leave.

In early 1986, &quot;Perth&quot;, along with several other ships, visited Hobart prior to participation in Exercise Tasman Sea as part of celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the Australian Navy&#x27;s foundation. On arriving in Hobart on 7 February, the destroyer accidentally rammed a wharf with her bow, damaging it and the two-storey waterfront building, while narrowly missing a &quot;Welcome&quot; sign. Damage to the ship was not so significant as to prevent participation in the exercise, after which, &quot;Perth&quot; visited Melbourne. This was the start of a series of port visits by the ship, up the western coast of Australia, to Darwin, then into South-east Asia and the Indian Ocean, before returning via Australia&#x27;s eastern coast. She spent almost all of 1989 docked for maintenance and upgrades.

===1990s===
In February 1990, after completing post-refit trials, the destroyer sailed to Hobart to act as flagship for the Royal Hobart Regatta. She then sailed to South-east Asia in May, participating in several naval exercises and making port visits throughout the region before returning to Sydney in October.
During mid-1991, &quot;Perth&quot; sailed to the Mediterranean via South-east Asia and eastern Africa. She returned to Sydney in August, then spent the rest of the year on training exercises and visits to New Zealand. Early 1990 saw her return to South-east Asia, then operate off the coast of Western Australia before a stint in the South China Sea, returning to Australia in November. The ship spent the early part of 1994 making port visits to western Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand before docking for refit in June. This did not conclude until the end of March 1995, with the ship sailing to the South China Sea for multinational naval exercises later in the year. In 1996, &quot;Perth&quot; participated in RIMPAC, before visiting Melbourne for the Melbourne Cup. She returned to Hawaii for another RIMPAC exercise in 1998. 1999 was spent primarily on exercises, along with a deployment to South East Asia, including port visits to Vietnam (for the first time since the war), Guam, Manila, Hong Kong and Singapore. &quot;Perth&quot; completed a round-Australia voyage during July and August prior to de-commissioning.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Perth&quot; was decommissioned on 15 October 1999. The destroyer was gifted to the Western Australian government in December 1999. She was scuttled as a dive wreck off the coast of Albany, Western Australia, on 24 November 2001.

The original ships&#x27; bells of the destroyer &quot;Perth&quot; and her World War II-era predecessor, the cruiser , are displayed at the Perth Town Hall.

<text>Wishart Flett Spence (March 9, 1904 – April 16, 1998) was a puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of James Houston Spence and Margaret Hackland, Spence graduated from the University of Toronto Schools. He then received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the University of Toronto in 1925, studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School, where he received the gold medal for finishing first in his class, and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1928. In 1929, Spence received his Masters of Law from Harvard Law School. Spence practised law in Toronto and was a part-time lecturer at Osgoode Hall. In 1950, he was appointed to the High Court of Justice of Ontario.

On May 30, 1963, Spence was appointed to the Supreme Court.

In 1966, he chaired the royal commission investigating the Munsinger Affair, which involved allegations that an East German spy had been sleeping with Canadian Cabinet ministers. Spence criticised the way the Diefenbaker government had handled the matter, but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or security breaches.

In the 1970s, Spence frequently joined with Chief Justice Bora Laskin and Justice Brian Dickson on cases involving civil liberties, often in dissent. The grouping was colloquially referred to as &quot;LSD.&quot;

Spence retired from the Court on December 29, 1978. In 1979, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

Spence died on April 16, 1998, at the age of 94.
