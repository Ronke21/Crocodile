It is bounded by the Krishna district and Bay of Bengal to the south, East Godavari district to the east, and Eluru district, Kolleru Lake and Upputeru Drain to the northwest.

== History ==
The Eastern Chalukyas ruled coastal Andhra Pradesh from 700 to 1200 CE, with their capital in Vengi. Historical evidence of their rule has been found in the nearby villages of Pedavegi and Guntupalli (Jilakarragudem). Eluru then became a part of the Kalinga Empire until 1471 CE before conquest by the Gajapati Empire. In 1515 CE, Sri Krishna Deva Raya captured it. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Kingdom, it was ruled by the Qutb Shahi Dynasty&#x27;s Sultans of Golkonda. On 15 April 1925, the West Godavari District was formed with Bhimavaram as its headquarters, and all of the district offices and regional offices were centralised in Eluru.

During the Madras Presidency in 1823, the District of Rajahmundry was created. It was reorganised in 1859 and bifurcated into the Godavari and Krishna districts. Kakinada became the headquarters of the Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into the East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was divided, Eluru became the headquarters of West Godavari. After the 4 April 2022 bifurcation for a separate Eluru district, Bhimavaram became the new headquarters of the West Godavari district.

<text>Modi&#x27;in Illit (; , lit. &quot;Upper Modi&#x27;in&quot;) is a Haredi Jewish-Israeli settlement organized as a city council in the West Bank, situated midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.

Built on the land of five Palestinian villages–Ni&#x27;lin, Kharbata, Saffa, Bil&#x27;in, and Dir Qadis–Modi&#x27;in Illit was granted city status by the Israeli government in 2008. The international community has largely viewed Israeli settlements in the West Bank, referred to by Israel as Judea and Samaria, as illegal under international law. However, Israel disputes this interpretation and maintains that settlements are legal and consistent with international law, citing historical, legal, and security reasons. This position has been upheld by successive Israeli governments.

It is located six kilometres () northeast of Modi&#x27;in-Maccabim-Re&#x27;ut and is often referred to as Kiryat Sefer (lit. &quot;Book Town&quot;), the name of its first neighborhood, established in 1994. Modi&#x27;in Illit also encompasses the neighborhood of Achuzat Brachfeld (Brachfeld Estates). In , it had a total population of , making it the largest Jewish settlement in the area.

==History==
A place named Kiryat Sefer (also called Dvir) is mentioned several times in the Book of Joshua and in the Book of Judges. However, this place is situated south of Hebron, and the Israeli Governmental names committee rejected calling the town Kiryat Sefer as was proposed initially, electing the name Modi&#x27;in Illit.

According to ARIJ the settlement was built on the land confiscated from several Palestinian villages:

*1,818 dunams from Deir Qaddis,
*891 dunams from Bil&#x27;in,
*833 dunams from Kharbatha Bani Harith,
*384 dunams from Ni&#x27;lin.

The barrier surrounding the city divides the nearby village of Bil&#x27;in from most of its olive groves and other agricultural land and is the subject of the documentary &quot;5 Broken Cameras&quot;. The homes in Kiryat Sefer were completed in 1994, and the local council of Modi&#x27;in Illit was given city status on March 7, 2008. In keeping with its name, which means &quot;Book Town,&quot; most of Kiryat Sefer&#x27;s streets are named after a landmark &quot;sefer&quot; (book) written by &quot;Gedolei Yisrael&quot;. These include: &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;, &quot;Noda BiYehuda&quot;, &quot;Meshech Chochma&quot;, &quot;Avnei Nezer&quot;, and &quot;Sdei Chemed&quot;.

==Geography and climate==
Situated in the West Bank, north of Modi&#x27;in, Modi&#x27;in Illit lies from the Green Line, and from the 443 highway. Located in the foothills of the Judean Mountains 286 meters (938 feet) above sea level, Modi&#x27;in Illit has mild winters and hot, dry summers with temperatures averaging during the day. Modi&#x27;in Illit&#x27;s immediate neighbors are moshav Matityahu, Lapid, and Hashmonaim.

==Archaeology==

=== Khirbet Badd ‘Isa ===
An archaeological site now known as Khirbet Badd ‘Isa was discovered during a salvage dig by the archaeology department of the Civil Administration in Modi&#x27;in Illit in 1994. The excavations eventually revealed what is believed to have been a large Jewish village from the Second Temple period with a public structure in the center, which probably served as a synagogue, at least three ritual baths, private homes (some built with Herodian blocks), an oil press, warehouses, and a collection of 145 Roman coins from the first century CE. Archaeological data indicate that the village was established during the Hellenistic period and existed up until the First Jewish–Roman War ( CE). It was resettled by Jews who later took part in the Bar Kokhba revolt ( CE). The site was destroyed during the revolt and remained uninhabited up until the third century. This settlement gap may mark the end of the Jewish settlement and the arrival of a new population at the area.

The excavations at the site were first protested by the Haredi community, but after the discovery Khirbet Badd ‘Isa was designated &quot;a heritage site for the Haredi public&quot; in 2011, and the Israeli government contributed NIS 3 million to develop the site, with another NIS 1 million reportedly coming from the Civil Administration. According to Mod&#x27;in Illit&#x27;s Mayor Yaakov Gutterman of the Degel HaTorah party, the site &quot;will operate according to the doctrines of our forefathers, according to the Jewish historical sources presented by the Bible, the Gemara and ancient Jewish sages only [and] will be open only to the Haredi public, which will keep it a proper place for them to visit and connect to their Jewish roots, without the distortions and disruptions of other places, where there is fear of hearing false opinions.&quot;

=== Ḥorvat Abu a-Danin ===
Another archeological site called Hurvat Abu a-Danin is located on the northern slope of Nahal Modi&#x27;im, directly south of the city&#x27;s built-up area. Finkelstein surveyed the site in the 1980s, and suggested that a public building might be located in the middle of the site. In 2004 and 2005, excavations were conducted, and uncovered the ruins of a rural Jewish village from the late Second Temple period. Archeological findingsi indicate that the community was founded in the second century BCE, had its apex in the first centuries BCE and CE, and ceased to exist following the Bar Kohkba revolt. The site underwent some minor resettlement in the late Roman and Byzantine eras.

==Demographics==
According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), as of the end of 2009, the city had a total population of 46,200, making it the largest Israeli settlement in the West Bank. The city had an annual growth rate of 13.2 percent in 2009, due to new home construction and natural population growth. An estimated 80 percent of the population is under age 30, and in 2006 the city&#x27;s median age stood at 10, the lowest of all Israeli municipalities.

==Education==
Modi&#x27;in Illit has 30 elementary schools and 20 secondary schools (seminaries and yeshivas). Achuzat Brachfeld (Brachfeld Estates) is home to the Mir Brachfeld branch of the famous Mir Yeshiva.

The city is home to many commercial enterprises. Because of its sizable English-speaking immigrant population, it has become a center for outsourcing by American companies. There are approximately 80 synagogues. A significant number of men study the Torah full-time.

==Local government==
Yaakov Gutterman of the Degel HaTorah party, a rabbi, is the town&#x27;s mayor. The first head of council of Modi&#x27;in Illit was Yosef Schwinger, appointed by the Ministry of the Interior. Yaakov Gutterman replaced him in 2002, and has been reinstated twice when he ran for election uncontested.

The Chief Rabbi and head of Rabbinical Court of Modi&#x27;in Illit is Rabbi Meir Kessler.

==Israeli–Palestinian conflict==

===Legal status of the settlement===
The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention&#x27;s prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power&#x27;s civilian population into occupied territory and are as such illegal under customary international law. Israel disputes that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies to the Palestinian territories as they had not been legally held by a sovereign prior to Israel taking control of them. This view has been rejected by the International Court of Justice and the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Modi&#x27;in Illit was granted city status in 2008, by Aluf Gadi Shamni. The Israeli NGO B&#x27;Tselem appealed the decision to the Ministry of Interior. B&#x27;Tselem claimed that the upgrading of Modi&#x27;in Illit&#x27;s status to that of a municipality was of concern because the land on which Mod&#x27;in Illit was built was declared state land through a manipulative application of Ottoman Law, resulting in the confiscation of lands belonging to neighbouring Palestinian villages. B&#x27;Tselem also stated that the upgraded status would lead to an increase of the settler population of Modi&#x27;in Illit, and thus the change in status would be illegal. For these reasons, B&#x27;Tselem expressed &quot;vehement opposition&quot; to the change of status. In connection with separate allegations that the city has allowed illegal construction to take place, the Israel Defense Forces told Israel&#x27;s Interior Ministry in May 2008 that Modi&#x27;in Illit was &quot;in a state of lawlessness.&quot;

Israel&#x27;s West Bank Barrier passes just east of Modi&#x27;in Illit. The barrier&#x27;s section in this area was built to separate the Modi&#x27;in bloc settlements of Mattityahu, Modi&#x27;in Illit and Hashmona&#x27;im from the Palestinian villages of Bil&#x27;in and others. The Israeli government believes that Modi&#x27;in Illit would remain within Israeli jurisdiction in a final-status agreement with the Palestinians.

=== Attack on residents ===
On the morning of 29 December 2008, a Palestinian worker who had worked in the settlement of Modi&#x27;in Illit for more than a decade attacked four Israelis, leaving one victim seriously and three others lightly wounded. He first stabbed two people for whom he was carrying out renovations in a private home on Rehov Yehuda Hanassi, wounding them lightly, and then stabbed and seriously wounded his Israeli employer who was overseeing the work. After stabbing a fourth person at a different location, he was shot and seriously wounded by a settlement security official and Magen David Adom volunteer as he attempted to flee out of the settlement. Reportedly, the assailant had been very friendly with Israelis for years. According to an Israel Police spokesperson, the stabbing was a &quot;spontaneous&quot; act in response to the aerial offensive on the Gaza Strip that Israel had started two days earlier.

<text>Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev () is an urban Israeli settlement in the West Bank, five kilometers northwest of Jerusalem. The settlement was founded in 1977 on the site of the abandoned Jordanian military camp, adjacent to the site of ancient Gibeon. While it lies within the borders of the Matte Binyamin Regional Council, it is a separate municipal entity. In it had a population of .

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.

==Description==
According to the Applied Research Institute–Jerusalem, Israel has confiscated land from three nearby Palestinian villages to construct Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev: 
*2,246 dunams from Al Jib,
*30 dunams from Beit Duqqu,
*9 dunums from Beit Ijza,
*1,036 dunams from Beitunia, for Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev and Beit Horon.

It was named after Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky, and declared a local council in 1983. Palestinians contend that under the expropriation maps contained in military orders, the road connecting it to Jerusalem, though ostensibly designed to &quot;facilitate Palestinian movement&quot;, actually would confiscate 15 square kilometers of prime agricultural land, on which the livelihoods of 24,000 Palestinians depend to enable the programmed development of this settlement bloc.

In 1996 a program of expansion with new housing units and an envisaged 20,000 new settlers was approved, to be constructed on land confiscated from the Palestinian villages of Beitunia, Biddu, and Jib, in what Palestinians call Wadi Salman, but which the Israelis have renamed Ha&#x27;ayalot valley. Twice in successive years further areas amounting to 250 acres were confiscated from Beitunia and Jib to build an additional 11,550 units. On March 9, 2008, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert approved the construction of 750 new homes in Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev under the Agan Ha&#x27;ayalot project. This approval stands in contrast to Olmert&#x27;s policy of freezing new permits for expansion within existing settlements. Olmert argued that the project was first approved in 1999, but stopped in 2000, as a result of the Second Intifada. The approval was criticized by the Palestinian Authority, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and the European Union. On the political right, the Shas party took credit for pressuring Olmert to approve the project.

Both the Ayelet HaShahar synagogue and yeshiva built on private Palestinian land owned by the Allatif family of the nearby Palestinian township of Jib, are slated to be demolished by March 2014, after the prosecutor&#x27;s office determined that the putative documents of land purchase were forgeries.

Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev has four elementary schools and one junior high school. There are two youth movement branches: the Israeli Scouts (Arava tribe) and Bnei Akiva.

==Location==
It is located just off Highway 443, affording easy access to both Jerusalem and the Tel Aviv area. It is connected to Jerusalem by Egged Ta&#x27;avura bus routes 131, 132, 133, 134 and to Tel Aviv by Egged bus number 471.
The loop circling Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev effectively annexes over 18 square miles of Palestinian land. The town is patrolled by Mishmeret Ha&#x27;gvul and a local security force, and is secured by a security fence. Plans are underway to set a guard post near the entrance to route 443 (currently, the road is closed off by a security fence).

==Religious life==
The religious population in mixed and includes Chardal, Dati Leumi, Charedi and Secular. There are about 20 orthodox synagogues in the town, with more expected to be built as the community expands.

Giv&#x27;at Ze&#x27;ev is the center of the Karlin-Stolin Chasidim and one of the town&#x27;s most notable residents is the Stoliner Rebbe Boruch Yaakov Meir Shochet. There is also a Chabad Lubavitch community there as well.

==Ramat Givat Zeev==
Ramat Givat Zeev is a new section that was being developed in 2013. The 400 housing units include both single-family houses and multi-family apartment buildings. The development is being marketed towards English-speaking religious Jews making Aliyah to Israel.

<text>Paget Valerie Brewster ( ; born March 10, 1969) is an American actress. She first received recognition for her recurring role as Kathy on the fourth season of &quot;Friends&quot;. She gained wider recognition in the late 2000s for portraying the FBI Supervisory Special Agent Emily Prentiss on the CBS crime drama series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. Brewster was a regular cast member of the show from 2006 to 2012, then made two guest appearances before returning as a regular in 2016.

==Early life==
Brewster was born March 10, 1969, in Concord, Massachusetts. Both her mother, Hathaway Brewster ( Tew), and father, Galen Brewster, worked as school administrators at Middlesex School.

Brewster grew up in Massachusetts and moved to New York City to attend Parsons School of Design. During her first year, she made her acting debut and eventually dropped out of design school to pursue her acting career. In the mid-1990s, Brewster moved to San Francisco and enrolled in acting classes.

==Career==
In 1995, Brewster hosted a late-night talk show in the San Francisco Bay Area called &quot;The Paget Show&quot; for 65 episodes at KPIX-TV. She first came to prominent attention in her recurring role as Kathy in the fourth season of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Friends&quot;. She appeared in &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; and &quot;Huff&quot;. On film she played Ms. Indestructible, the female lead in James Gunn&#x27;s low-budget superhero comedy &quot;The Specials&quot; (2000). She played Amy Pierson, a calculus teacher afraid of the water, in the independent film &quot;The Big Bad Swim&quot;, which premiered at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival.

In 2005, she began voice work as Judy Ken Sebben / Birdgirl, a recurring character on the animated series &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; (and later played a similar guest character on &quot;American Dad!&quot;).
Brewster had a long run with the show &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, playing multilingual Supervisory Special Agent Emily Prentiss until the show&#x27;s sixth season, when she and A. J. Cook were released from their contracts by CBS in a cost-cutting move. Owing to complaints from fans, both she and Cook were rehired and kept for the following season. In February 2012, Brewster announced via Deadline that she was leaving &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; at the end of the season to return to her comedic and sitcom roots. Brewster reprised her role as Emily Prentiss in season nine for the 200th episode, and season 11 as a special guest star. In 2016, Brewster returned to &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; once again as a series regular with Thomas Gibson&#x27;s replacement.

Brewster subsequently portrayed bureau chief PDA Paula Foster in the Public Integrity Unit of the District Attorney&#x27;s office on NBC&#x27;s long-running police drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. Her character handled the case against SVU commanding officer Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), suspected of murder after awakening next to a dead woman in the 13th-season finale.

Brewster was a regular on &quot;The Thrilling Adventure Hour&quot;, a staged production in the style of old-time radio that was recorded monthly at Largo in Los Angeles. She played the recurring character of Sadie Doyle, the alcoholic socialite who can communicate with the supernatural alongside her husband, Frank (Paul F. Tompkins), in the &quot;Beyond Belief&quot; segments. In early April 2013, Brewster appeared in &quot;Modern Family&quot; as Trish in episode 20, &quot;Flip Flop&quot;, playing an art expert who is dating Gloria&#x27;s ex-husband, Javier. In August 2013, Brewster appeared in episode 106 of the &quot;Drunk History&quot; television series on Comedy Central. In January 2015, Brewster began appearing on &quot;Community&quot;. In February 2014, it was announced that she had been cast in a new ABC comedy called &quot;St. Francis&quot;. In August 2016, it was announced that she would be reprising her role as Emily Prentiss on &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and would once again be a series regular after co-star Thomas Gibson was fired by CBS over an on-set altercation. Brewster also regularly appears on &quot;Will You Accept This Rose&quot;, a podcast hosted by Arden Myrin about &quot;The Bachelor&quot; franchise.

==Personal life==
On the March 30, 2006, episode of &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, Brewster revealed that she had received a handwritten note indicating Hugh Hefner would like her to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot;. She seriously considered the offer, but even though she said that she admired &quot;Playboy&quot; more than magazines such as &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;FHM&quot;, and her parents gave her their blessing, she eventually turned it down.

She has volunteered as an actress with the Los Angeles Young Storytellers Program.

On March 17, 2013, Brewster became engaged to Steve Damstra, a member of the bands Folded Light and Whirlwind Heat. Brewster and Damstra married on November 28, 2014, in Los Angeles, in a ceremony officiated by Matthew Gray Gubler, their close friend and Brewster&#x27;s &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; co-star. , the couple resides in Los Angeles.

<text>Disneyland Park, originally Euro Disneyland Park, is a theme park found at Disneyland Paris in Marne-la-Vallée, France. The park opened on 12 April 1992 as the first of the two parks built at the resort. Designed and built by Walt Disney Imagineering, its layout is similar to Disneyland Park in California and Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Florida. Spanning —the second largest Disney park based on the original, after Shanghai Disneyland—it is dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters.

The park is represented by Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant (Sleeping Beauty Castle), a replica of the fairy tale castle seen in Disney&#x27;s 1959 animated film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. In 2023 the park hosted 10.4 million visitors, making it the ninth-most visited theme park in the world and the most-visited theme park in Europe.

== History ==
In order to make things more distinct and not be a mere copy of the original, modifications were made to the park&#x27;s concepts and designs. Among the changes was the change of Tomorrowland to Discoveryland, giving the area a retrofuturistic theme. Other altered elements include the Haunted Mansion, which was redesigned as Phantom Manor and a retro, more intense version of Space Mountain (now Hyperspace Mountain). The park&#x27;s location brought forth its own challenges. Sleeping Beauty Castle (Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant) is said by its designers to have been necessarily reevaluated for a continent on which authentic castles stand. Modifications to the park were made to protect against changes in weather in the Parisian climate. Covered walkways referred to as &quot;arcades&quot; were added, and Michael Eisner ordered the installation of 35 fireplaces in hotels and restaurants.

The park, as well as its surrounding complex, initially failed to meet financial expectations, resulting in an image change in which the word &quot;Euro&quot; was phased out of several names, including Euro Disney. The park was known as Euro Disney until May 1994, Euro Disneyland Paris until September 1994, Disneyland Paris until February 2002, and Disneyland Park (English) and Parc Disneyland (French) since March 2002.

Michael Eisner noted, &quot;As Americans, the word &#x27;Euro&#x27; is believed to mean glamorous or exciting. For Europeans it turned out to be a term they associated with business, currency, and commerce. Renaming the park &#x27;Disneyland Paris&#x27; was a way of identifying it with one of the most romantic and exciting cities in the world.&quot;

On 14 March 2020, Disneyland Park, alongside the Walt Disney Studios Park, was temporarily closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Both parks remained closed for four months, resuming operations on 15 July with strict rules such as limited guest attendance, social distancing, and mandatory wearing of face masks. The park closed again on 29 October 2020 following a second nationwide lockdown. The park reopened on 17 June 2021.

== Park layout and attractions ==
Disneyland Park is divided into five themed &quot;lands&quot;, which house 49 attractions. Designed like a wheel with the hub on Central Plaza before Sleeping Beauty Castle, pathways spoke out across the of the park and lead to the lands. The narrow gauge Disneyland Railroad runs along the perimeter of the park and stops in Main Street, U.S.A., Frontierland, Fantasyland and Discoveryland.

<doc id="1162522" wikidata="Q905871" url="?curid=1162522" title="Blame Canada">
<text>&quot;Blame Canada&quot; is a satirical song from the 1999 animated film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, written by Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman. The song satirizes scapegoating and parents who fail to control &quot;their children&#x27;s consumption of popular culture&quot;, with the fictional &quot;South Park&quot; parents, led by Sheila Broflovski (Mary Kay Bergman), blaming the nation for children imitating the Terrance and Phillip film &quot;Asses of Fire&quot;. 

&quot;Blame Canada&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 72nd Academy Awards. Parker and Matt Stone arrived at the ceremony in dresses previously worn by Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow, and later claimed to be under the influence of LSD while on the red carpet.

An 8-bit remix of the song appears in the 2014 game &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, included as one of the overworld themes for the Canada level. The song appears again in the game&#x27;s 2017 sequel, &quot;South Park: The Fractured but Whole,&quot; near the Canadian wall. 

Shaiman wrote new lyrics for the song in 2023 reflecting conspiracy theories about the Canadian wildfires that year.

==Reception==
The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 72nd Academy Awards (1999). This created controversy because all nominated songs are traditionally performed during the Oscar broadcast, but the song contained the word &quot;fuck&quot;, which the FCC prohibits using in prime time broadcasts. At the awards ceremony, comedian Robin Williams performed the song with a chorus that gasped when the word was to be sung (Williams turned around at the crucial moment and did not actually sing it). He included digs at Margaret Trudeau and Bryan Adams, partially taken from lyrics of Sheila Broflovski&#x27;s reprise of the song in &quot;La Resistance&quot;. He referenced Celine Dion as well. Mary Kay Bergman, the voice actress who sang the female parts in the song, died months before the performance, forcing the organizers to search for a replacement for her and Trey Parker, who did the male voices. Williams introduced the song by speaking with duct tape over his mouth so that his speech resembled that of Kenny McCormick, then tearing it off and finally saying Stan Marsh&#x27;s trademark line, &quot;Oh my god! They killed Kenny!&quot;

There was also some concern about the fact the song referred to well-known Canadian singer Anne Murray as a &quot;bitch&quot;, but Murray indicated that she was not offended by the tongue-in-cheek lyric (Murray was invited to sing the song herself on the Oscar telecast but had to decline due to a prior commitment). When asked, the Canadian Consul General (and former prime minister) Kim Campbell said that she was not offended by the song since it was clearly a silly satirical piece and not intended to insult her country. This is made clear in the final line of the song:
We must blame them and cause a fuss.Before somebody thinks of blaming us!

Coincidentally, the Canadian Oscar telecast in which Williams sang the song included the premiere of the Molson Canadian &quot;I Am Canadian&quot; rant advertisement, which counters many perceived Canadian stereotypes.

The song lost to Phil Collins&#x27; song &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in My Heart&quot; from &quot;Tarzan&quot;, which was parodied on an episode of &quot;South Park&quot; released the following year, &quot;Timmy 2000&quot;, as &quot;You&#x27;ll Be in Me&quot;.

<text>Closer is a 2004 American romantic drama directed and produced by Mike Nichols and written by Patrick Marber, based on his award-winning 1997 play. It stars Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen. The film, like the play on which it is based, has been seen by some as a modern and tragic version of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s 1790 opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, with references to the opera in both the plot and the soundtrack. Owen starred in the play as Dan, the role played by Law in the film.

&quot;Closer&quot; received favorable reviews and grossed $115 million at the box office. It was recognized with a number of awards and nominations, including Academy Award nominations and Golden Globe wins for both Portman and Owen for their performances.

==Plot==
During a busy morning in London, writer Dan Woolf meets a beautiful American woman after she is hit by a car, not used to the direction of traffic in England. On their walk back from the hospital, they stop by Postman&#x27;s Park. Dan asks her name, which she gives as Alice Ayres. They soon become lovers.

One year later, Dan has written a novel based on Alice&#x27;s life. While being photographed to publicise it, he flirts with the American photographer Anna Cameron. They share a kiss before Alice arrives. While she uses the bathroom, Dan tries to persuade Anna to have an affair with him but their conversation is cut short by Alice&#x27;s return. Alice then asks Anna if she can have her portrait taken as well. She agrees, so Alice asks Dan to leave them alone during the photoshoot. While being photographed, she reveals to Anna that she overheard them, and she is photographed while crying. Alice does not tell Dan what she heard and their relationship continues, but he spends a year brooding over Anna.

Another year later, Dan enters a cybersex chat room and converses with Larry Gray, a British dermatologist. Still obsessed with Anna, Dan pretends to be her and invites Larry to meet at the aquarium, where he knows Anna often goes. Larry goes to the rendezvous, where he happens to meet her, and learns that he is the victim of a prank. Anna tells Larry that Dan was most likely to blame for the setup. Soon, Anna and Larry become a couple.

Four months later at Anna&#x27;s photo exhibition, Larry meets Alice, whom he recognises from the photograph of her in tears on display. Anna told him that Alice and Dan are a couple. Dan persuades Anna to become involved with him, and they cheat on their respective lovers for a year, even though Anna and Larry marry halfway through the year. Eventually, Dan confesses the affair to Alice and Anna to Larry, who admitted to her that he had cheated on her with a prostitute. Dan and Anna leave their relationships for one another.

Heartbroken, Alice again becomes a stripper. One day, Larry runs into her by surprise at the strip club. When he asks her real name, she tells him it is Jane Jones. He asks her to have sex with him, but she refuses.

Later, Larry and Anna meet for coffee so he can sign their divorce papers. He bargains with her – if she sleeps with him, he will sign the documents and thereafter leave her alone. Anna and Dan later meet and, once she reveals the divorce papers have been signed, he realizes she has had sex with Larry. She did it so he would leave them alone, but Dan is furious and does not trust her.

A distraught Dan later confronts Larry to get Anna back. Larry tells him Anna never filed the signed divorce papers and suggests he return to Alice. Alice takes Dan back and they plan a visit to the United States for a vacation. While in a hotel room at Gatwick Airport celebrating being back together, they talk about how they met. Bringing up Larry, Dan then asks if she had sex with him. She initially denies it but a short while later, she says she does not love him anymore and that she did sleep with Larry. Dan forgives her, but Alice insists it is over and tells him to leave. The argument culminates in Dan slapping Alice.
At the film&#x27;s end, Larry and Anna are together, and Alice returns to New York City alone. As she passes through the immigration checkpoint on her way back into the States, a shot of her passport shows her real name is Jane Jones, revealing she had lied about her name during her entire four-year relationship with Dan but had told the truth to Larry, even though he did not believe her. Back in London, Dan returns to Postman&#x27;s Park and notices the name Alice Ayres on the tiles of the Memorial to Heroic Self-Sacrifice. The Ayres dedication is to a young woman, &quot;who by intrepid conduct&quot; and &quot;at the cost of her own young life,&quot; rescued three children from a fire.

The final scene, which resembles the first, shows Jane walking on a New York street alone being stared at by several of the men around her. She crosses a crosswalk that appears to have a &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk&quot; signal up.

==Production==

===Filming===
Cate Blanchett was originally cast in the role of Anna, but had to drop out of the film in September 2003, before filming had begun, when she became pregnant with her second son, Roman.

&quot;Closer&quot; was filmed at Elstree Film and Television Studios and on location in London.

===Music===
The main theme of the film follows Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, with references to that opera in both the plot and the soundtrack. One of the pivotal scenes develops to the background of the overture to Rossini&#x27;s opera &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; (&quot;Cinderella&quot;). The soundtrack also contains songs from Jem, Damien Rice and Lisa Hannigan, Bebel Gilberto, the Devlins, the Prodigy and the Smiths.

The music of Irish folk singer Damien Rice is featured in the film, most notably the song &quot;The Blower&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; whose lyrics have parallels to many of the themes in the film. The opening notes from Rice&#x27;s song &quot;Cold Water&quot; are also used repeatedly, notably in the memorial park scenes. Rice wrote a song titled &quot;Closer&quot; which was intended for use in the film but was not completed in time.

==Reception==

===Critical reaction===
The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval score of 68% based on 212 reviews, and an average rating of 6.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;&quot;Closer&quot;&#x27;s talented cast and Mike Nichols&#x27; typically assured direction help smooth a bumpy journey from stage to screen.&quot; Another review aggregator, Metacritic, shows a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 42 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert, writing for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, said of the people involved with the film, &quot;[t]hey are all so very articulate, which is refreshing in a time when literate and evocative speech has been devalued in the movies.&quot; Peter Travers, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, said, &quot;Mike Nichols&#x27; haunting, hypnotic &quot;Closer&quot; vibrates with eroticism, bruising laughs and dynamite performances from four attractive actors doing decidedly unattractive things.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;[d]espite involved acting and Nichols&#x27; impeccable professionalism as a director, the end result is, to quote one of the characters, &#x27;a bunch of sad strangers photographed beautifully&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″ A. O. Scott wrote, &quot;[u]nlike most movie love stories, &quot;Closer&quot; does have the virtue of unpredictability. The problem is that, while parts are provocative and forceful, the film as a whole collapses into a welter of misplaced intensity.&quot; In a review on &quot;The Atlantic&quot; website, Christoper Orr described the film as &quot;flamboyantly bad&quot; and &quot;irretrievably silly, a potty-mouthed fantasy that somehow mistakes itself for a fearless excavation of the dark recesses of the human soul&quot;, suggesting that what might have worked on stage came across as &quot;ostentatious melodrama&quot; on film.

In a review from &quot;Allmovie&quot;, Perry Seibert praised the acting, the direction and the screenwriting, stating that Clive Owen &quot;finds every dimension in his alpha-male character&quot;, Julia Roberts &quot;shows not an ounce of movie-star self-consciousness&quot;, Natalie Portman &quot;understands [her character] inside and out&quot; and affirming that &quot;[w]ith his superior timing, Nichols allows each of these actors to hit every funny, cruel, and intimate moment in the script&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Peter Bradshaw gave &quot;Closer&quot; a one-star review and stated that Clive Owen was the only actor that portrayed &quot;real emotions&quot; in the film, saying that the other three lead actors could have just been &quot;advertising perfume&quot;.

===Box office===
&quot;Closer&quot; was released on December 3, 2004 in North America. &quot;Closer&quot; opened in 476 theaters, but the theater count was increased after the film was released. The film was domestically a moderate financial success, grossing $33,987,757. Huge success followed in the international market, where the film grossed an additional $81,517,270; over 70% of its $115,505,027 worldwide gross. The film was produced on a budget of US$27 million.

===Awards and nominations=== 
==Home media==
&quot;Closer&quot; was first released on VHS and DVD on March 29, 2005 and on Blu-ray on May 22, 2007.

<doc id="1162529" wikidata="Q715266" url="?curid=1162529" title="Mikado pheasant">
<text>The Mikado pheasant (Syrmaticus mikado) is a species of gamebird in the pheasant family Phasianidae of the order Galliformes, gallinaceous birds. Sometimes considered an unofficial &quot;national bird&quot; of Taiwan (along with the Swinhoe&#x27;s pheasant and Taiwan blue magpie), a pair of Mikado pheasants and Yushan National Park, one of the areas it is known to inhabit, is depicted in the 1000 dollar bill of the New Taiwan dollar.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Mikado pheasant is endemic to mountainous regions of Taiwan. The species occupies dense shrubs, bamboo growth and grassy terrain with conifer overstory in central and southern Taiwan, from 2000 to 3200 meters above sea level.

==Description==

With the tail included, males of this species get to be up to 70 cm in body length, while the smaller females measure up to 47 cm. The male is dark with plumage that refracts with blue or violet iridescence, with white stripes on its wings and tail. The female is brown and speckled with brown and white quills. The long and striped tail feathers of the male were used by the Taiwanese aborigines as a head-dress decoration. The type specimen of the pheasant comprises two such tail feathers obtained in 1906 by collector Walter Goodfellow from the head-dress of one of his porters. It was named in honor of the Emperor of Japan, of which Taiwan was occupied by.

==Behavior==
The pheasants will often come out into the open either in light rain or after heavy rain, where the mist conceals them. They tend to be solitary or found in pairs, often quiet, yet alert. They can usually tolerate the presence of humans and it is possible to observe them up close, especially in areas where they have become habituated to humans feeding them. When disturbed, they will slowly and cautiously seek out shelter within surrounding vegetation, rather than fluttering away in panic. If desperate, they will fly short distances, gliding down the mountainside. The males are territorial, with a range of 200–400 metres in radius. Both sexes make soft clucking sounds when feeding, and the males make &quot;ke, ke, ke&quot; calls when fighting for their mate or territory. Both sexes may perform a wing-whirring display, and during the breeding season the male performs a lateral running display with his body expanded and tail fanned.

The Mikado pheasant is crepuscular, and tends to explore open areas while foraging for food. The optimal times for observing this species are 5–6 a.m. and 6–7 p.m. However, the specific times for best observation may vary, depending on seasonal differences in sunrise and sunset times.

==Feeding==
The pheasants will often walk and forage for food (a diet of various fruit, leaves, vegetation, seeds and invertebrates) at the same time, in a manner similar to chickens, on the forest floor and mountain trails, especially on rainy and foggy days.

==Vocalizations==
There are five commonly heard vocalizations of the Mikado pheasant: a deep &quot;gu, gu, gu&quot; sound, which is the most frequently heard and often heard continuously when they are in a relaxed state, while walking or pecking the ground. Another vocalization is a higher-pitched &quot;ko, ko, ko,&quot; typically produced during the mating season or when they sense nearby threat. The &quot;ji, ji&quot; vocalization occurs slightly less frequently than the previous two and is often heard when they perceive immediate danger from intruders. The &quot;cu, cu&quot; sound is the highest-pitched vocalization made by the Mikado pheasant and is usually heard when they are startled and take flight. It is similar to the aforementioned &quot;ji&quot; sound. Another vocalization, &quot;hu, hu,&quot; is produced when launching an attack using their beak and claws. This vocalization is distinct from the previous four and appears to be generated by expelling air from their beaks, whereas the first four are produced by the vocal muscles in the syrinx.

==Breeding==

The breeding season of Mikado pheasants lasts from March to June. Mikado pheasants build their nests mainly with dead branches, fallen leaves, dry grass and feathers in tree holes or depressions under rocks. Females usually lay three to eight creamy-colored eggs at one time and it is they who are solely responsible for the incubation of the eggs (which take about 26–28 days to hatch) and the nurture of fledglings, once they are born. The young are usually independent by six months the latest.

== Conservation status ==
There are some Mikado pheasants bred in captivity, but there are only about 10,000 individuals in the wild, particularly in the Yushan National Park. Heavy hunting pressure was a problem in the past, but is not a serious threat today. The Mikado pheasant is evaluated as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

Under protection numbers have increased with numbers within Yushan National Park increasing from 5,000 in 1986 to more than 10,000 in 2020. There are also significant recovered populations in Shei-Pa National Park and Taroko National Park.

<text>John Devereaux Wrather Jr. (May 24, 1918 – November 12, 1984), was an entrepreneur and petroleum businessman who became a television producer and later diversified by investing in broadcast stations and resort properties. He is best known for producing &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot;, and &quot;Lassie&quot; television series in the 1950s as well as marrying actress Bonita Granville. His daughter, Linda Wrather appeared in one of the last episodes of the Lone Ranger, The Angel and the Outlaw.

==Biography==
Wrather was born in Amarillo, Texas on to Mazie (Cogdell) and John Devereaux Wrather. They moved to Tyler, where he grew up and graduated from the local high school in 1935. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Bachelor of Arts degree from The University of Texas at Austin in 1939. He worked in the oilfields of East Texas as a wildcatter and pipeline walker as his college summer job. When his father became ill in the early 1940s, he took over as president of his father&#x27;s oil company, Overton Refining Company.

===First marriage and military service===
On , he married Molly O&#x27;Daniel, the daughter of Democratic Governor and later U.S. Senator Wilbert Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel. They had two children before divorcing in 1945. Wrather served in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve during World War II (1942–1945) in three campaigns, had the rank of Captain, and commanded a Marine air group in the Philippines.

=== Film business ===
After the war, he met his old roommate, actor Don Castle, who was struggling in Hollywood, and bought the film rights to Cornell Woolrich&#x27;s short story &quot;Two Men in a Furnished Room&quot; and set up Jack Wrather Pictures Inc. to film it (as &quot;The Guilty&quot; (1947)), starring Castle and Wrather&#x27;s new wife Bonita Granville. He bought a home in Hollywood and by 1955, he had produced six more movies, including &quot;High Tide&quot;, &quot;Perilous Waters&quot;, &quot;Strike It Rich&quot; and &quot;Guilty of Treason&quot;. The films were produced for Eagle-Lion Films, Warner Bros., Monogram/Allied Artists and United Artists.

He and Granville had two children.

Wrather purchased 70% of television station KOTV in Tulsa, Oklahoma from fellow oil millionaire George Cameron. The other 30% was owned by station manager Maria Helen Alvarez and commercial manager John Hill. Wrather knew nothing about the management of a station and offered to increase Alvarez and Hill to 50% of the stock in exchange for their services.

Hill wanted to move on to real estate, so Wrather agreed to purchase his shares and increase Alvarez to 50% owner in the new Wrather-Alvarez Television and Wrather-Alvarez Broadcasting companies.

Wrather-Alvarez went on to purchase the San Diego television and radio stations KFMB-TV and KFMB in 1953 and New York City radio station WNEW in 1955. Television station KOTV was sold in 1954 when Alvarez relocated to the San Diego station. Wrather-Alvarez also owned WJDW-TV in Boston, and donated it in 1965 to the WGBH Educational Foundation, which operates it as the PBS station WGBX-TV.

Wrather-Alvarez also financed and owned the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim. Walt Disney asked Wrather to build the hotel when Disney exhausted his credit line building the Disneyland theme park. The hotel was completed in 1955, and immediately shared the success of Disneyland. When Disney later attempted to buy the hotel, Wrather refused to sell.

In 1954, Wrather-Alvarez purchased the complete rights to the Lone Ranger character and took over production of the television series (1954–1957). The corporation also purchased the &quot;Lassie&quot; television series in 1956 and the &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot; television series in 1957.

The Wrather-Alvarez relationship did not end well. Wrather discovered that &quot;Miss&quot; Alvarez had married former partner John Hill when he had been &quot;bought out&quot; and his shares given to Alvarez. Wrather unsuccessfully sued Alvarez and Hill for fraud. In 1958, Wrather bought Alvarez&#x27;s shares of Wrather-Alvarez and became sole owner of its television and hotel assets. The Wrather-Alvarez holdings were distributed into the separate companies Wrather Hotels, Lone Ranger Inc., Lone Ranger Television, Lone Ranger Pictures, and Lassie Television.

The Independent Television Corporation was formed as a joint venture between Jack Wrather and the British Incorporated Television Company in 1958. In September 1958, Independent Television Corporation purchased TPA for $11,350,000. The company operated primarily as a distribution service for syndicating television shows produced by Wrather or the British ITC company. Wrather later (about 1959–60) sold his shares of Independent Television Corporation to ITC. He was also the founder of Los Angeles public television station KCET.

Wrather is known as the man that &quot;sued the mask off the Lone Ranger&quot;. When a new theatrical movie version of the Lone Ranger was being produced during the late 1970s, Wrather obtained a court order requiring Clayton Moore to quit making public appearances as the Lone Ranger. This resulted in a great deal of negative publicity, and &quot;The Legend of the Lone Ranger,&quot; released in 1981, was not well received. Before Wrather died, he gave Moore permission to resume making public appearances in costume.

=== Other investments ===
Wrather further diversified his holdings by building or buying resort hotels and other properties throughout the United States.

In addition to the Disneyland Hotel, he owned the Twin Lakes Lodge in Las Vegas, the L&#x27;Horizon Hotel in Palm Springs, California, the Balboa Bay Club &amp; Resort in Newport Beach, and the Inn at the Park in Anaheim. In the 1970s, there was talk of the Disneyland-Alweg monorail being expanded to stop at the Inn at the Park, but it never came to fruition. The Inn at the Park has changed ownership frequently, and is currently operated as the Sheraton Park Hotel at the Anaheim Resort.

In 1957, Wrather purchased the Muzak corporation, a company providing &quot;elevator music&quot; for business environments. The company owned an extensive library of easy listening music and one of the world&#x27;s largest recording plants. Wrather sold the company in 1972.

In the early 1980s, Wrather purchased, restored and made tourist attractions of the &quot;Spruce Goose&quot; and the in Long Beach, California.

Over the years, he created or purchased many companies for his businesses and investments, including Evansville Refining Co., Overton Refining Co., Jack Wrather Pictures, Inc., Freedom Productions Corporation, Western States Investment Corporation, Wrather-Alvarez Broadcasting, Inc., General Television Corporation, Jack Wrather Productions, Wrather Hotels, Lone Ranger Inc., Lone Ranger Television, Lone Ranger Pictures, Lassie Television, the Muzak Corporation, and the A.C. Gilbert Company. In 1961, he combined his various holdings into the Wrather Corporation.

===Death and aftermath===

Wrather died of cancer at age 66 on November 12, 1984, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, California. His funeral was held at the Roman Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills and he was buried at the Holy Cross Cemetery, in Culver City, California.

Disney finally acquired the Disneyland Hotel in 1987, when it purchased half share ownership in the Wrather Corporation and the other half in 1988. Disney has retained the hotel but sold off most of the other assets. Most of the Wrather franchises are now owned by DreamWorks Classics. 

Various documents related to Wrather, Bonita Granville, and the Wrather company are archived at Loyola Marymount University as part of its Center for the Study of Los Angeles collection, and at the Harry Ransom Center.

<doc id="1162536" wikidata="Q7436936" url="?curid=1162536" title="Scott Mutter">
<text>Charles Scott Mutter (January 14, 1944 – March 5, 2008) was an American photographer best known for his photomontages. His photos were shown in galleries and printed on a wide variety of media, from posters to mouse pads.

==Early life==
Mutter was the second of three children of Charles and Lucille Mutter, who lived in the Woodlawn area of South Side, Chicago. The family moved to suburban Park Ridge, Illinois, where he graduated from Maine East High School in Park Ridge in 1961. Mutter received a B.A. in history from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1966 and two master&#x27;s degrees, in fine arts and Chinese studies. While at university he was part of the counter culture, or hippie culture. He protested against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. He lived in Champaign into the early 1980s where he ran an antiques shop and showed classic and foreign movies in rented halls such as the McKinley Foundation or the Red Herring.

He had no formal art training.

==Career==
Most of Mutter&#x27;s work was done with images of and around the Chicago area, with some of his earlier pieces incorporating scenes from Urbana-Champaign and the University of Illinois. Mutter was never comfortable with being considered a surrealist, and coined the term &quot;surrational images&quot; to describe his work.

His first show was at the downtown Chicago bookstore Brentano&#x27;s in the mid-1970s. He then published calendars and posters through several publishing houses, including Avalanche Publishing. His best known work, &quot;Surrational Images&quot;, was published by the University of Illinois Press in 1992.

Some of his most famous works include a montage of fans using flashlights to illuminate Wrigley Field, which was then known for not having lights or night games; a photo of Michigan Avenue skyscrapers superimposed upon an image of the card catalogue at the University of Illinois Library; and a forest growing out of a parquet floor.

Mutter never transitioned to the cut and paste technique afforded by Photoshop and similar software but recreated every original print in the darkroom as he thought this was the only way that they were truly &quot;originals&quot;. From the few existing originals of each piece he would select the one he considered the most appropriate for reproduction as posters.

He was found dead in his home in March 2008, age 64; his death was ruled a suicide. He experienced depression for much of his adult life, and had cardiovascular problems.

==Artistic philosophy==
Sergei Eisenstein, a Russian filmmaker (1898–1948) and author of two books, &quot;The Film Sense&quot; and &quot;Film Form: Essays in Film Theory&quot;, greatly influenced Mutter&#x27;s ideas about photographic &quot;montage&quot;, a technique of combining and superimposing images into a single picture. Mutter believed &quot;there are theoretical reasons why a montage works or is something. But you have to also understand and keep your mind open to the fact that what works, works. That&#x27;s the bottom line.&quot; His images were an attempt to represent something that is reality, not physical but rather a representation through metaphor.

==Exhibitions==
His work has been exhibited at the San Francisco International Airport and at the opening of the Beam Performing Arts Center in Tokyo. His photographs have appeared in magazines and newspapers including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Herbert&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Japanese Avenue&quot;, and &quot;Print Magazine&quot;. His photos have been critiqued and viewed in many public schools across the country.

<text>The Jeep Comanche (designated MJ) is a pickup truck variant of the Cherokee compact SUV (1984–1992) manufactured and marketed by Jeep for model years 1986-1992 in rear wheel (RWD) and four-wheel drive (4WD) models as well as two cargo bed lengths: six-foot (1.83 meters) and seven-foot (2.13 meters).

==Introduction==
During the mid-1980s, according to AMC chairman W. Paul Tippett Jr. &quot;People are finding trucks a reasonable and sophisticated alternative to cars.&quot; To satisfy the demand and to compete with Japanese competitors, both AMC and Chrysler were preparing compact pickups for the 1986 and 1987 model years (respectively). Also at this time the financial health of AMC was poor and the automaker was in need of cash as it was preparing a new line of midsize sedans (the Eagle Premier) scheduled to be produced at a factory being built in Canada (Brampton Assembly), but the best thing the company had going for it was its popular line of Jeeps and introducing a compact Jeep pickup truck in the fall of 1985 was expected to help.

The Jeep Comanche was introduced in mid-August 1985, at a lavish event staged at the ballroom of the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (currently Bally&#x27;s Las Vegas) for AMC&#x27;s over 1,500 North American dealers. American Motors included Chinese officials as part of the negotiations establishing Beijing Jeep (now Beijing Benz). The goal was to produce and sell Comanches in China through this joint venture.

The new trucks were unveiled by Jose Dedeurwaerder, an engineer and international business executive with 23 years of experience with Renault, who had just been appointed as AMC&#x27;s new president. The base price of the two-wheel drive model was $7,049 (adjusted only for inflation equal to US$ in dollars), making it the lowest priced Jeep model for the 1986 model year.

==Design==
American Motors&#x27; Jeep designers based the Comanche MJ body, styling, engineering, and powertrain on the XJ Cherokee, which had been introduced for the 1984 model year. The Comanche had a somewhat more conventional body-on-frame design behind the cab and a removable cargo box, but retained the unibody construction of the Cherokee in the front half of the vehicle. In the United States where the Comanche and Dodge Rampage were sold they are both considered pickup trucks. By contrast, in other markets the Volkswagen Rabbit Pickup was called the Volkswagen Caddy and considered a coupe utility, not a truck because the cargo bed is an integral part of the body structure and not removable. However this is not the legal definition of truck in the United States where the Comanche, Rampage and Rabbit were all sold.

Two cargo bed lengths were used; one for the seven-foot long-bed model, which appeared first in 1986, and a second, shorter version for the six-foot cargo bed, which debuted for the 1987 model year. Unlike other pickups of the time that used C-channel frames, the Comanche&#x27;s frame design (called a &quot;Uniframe&quot; by Jeep) under the cargo bed was fully boxed, with a large X structure centered over the rear axle. For strength, the rails were over eight inches deep (top to bottom), much deeper than conventional midsize truck frames (1983 Jeep J-10 full-size truck frame is 6.75 inches at the deepest point). This structure was pioneered by AMC for the 1971 &quot;Cowboy&quot; compact pickup prototype.

From 1986 to 1987, the Jeep Comanche grille had ten slots in a similar configuration to the 1984-1987 Cherokee XJ, while from 1988 to 1992, this configuration changed to eight slots to match with the SUV. A new &quot;4x4&quot; badge, similar to those found on the Cherokee and Wagoneer models, was affixed to the upper rear of the cargo box on all the four-wheel drive models.

After the Chrysler buyout of American Motors for $1.5 billion on March 9, 1987, designed to capture &quot;the highly profitable Jeep vehicles ... and 1,400 additional dealers&quot;, the Jeep Comanche, like the similar Cherokee, received only minor changes. These were primarily to improve reliability and parts interchangeability with other Chrysler-built vehicles.

==Suspension==
The Comanche used the XJ Cherokee&#x27;s &quot;Quadralink&quot; front suspension, with coil springs and upper/lower control arms on a solid axle. It was argued that the coil springs allowed for greater ride comfort and axle articulation during off-road excursions. A track bar (Panhard rod) is used to keep the axle centered under the truck. Modified versions of this same basic suspension system were later used on the 1993–2004 Grand Cherokee, 1997 and newer TJ Wranglers and 1994 and newer Dodge Rams.

For the rear suspension, the truck used leaf springs that are considerably longer than the Cherokee&#x27;s, which give Comanches good load-carrying capacity without creating a hard ride. The standard rear axle was the same Dana 35 used in the Cherokee, except that the Comanche mounted the leaf springs underneath the axle, as do most other trucks, and the Cherokee mounted them on top of the axle. There was also a heavy duty Metric Ton package for the long-bed models. The package included heavier-duty leaf springs and wheels, larger tires, and upgraded the rear axle to a Dana 44, which increased the stock payload (cargo) capacity from , well above that of any other mid-size truck. The Metric Ton Comanche&#x27;s payload rating was higher than that of many full-size pickups.

==Powertrain==
The inaugural 1986 model year Comanches could be equipped with one of three engines: AMC&#x27;s 2.5 L four-cylinder as standard, with General Motors&#x27; 2.8 L V6 or Renault&#x27;s 2.1 L I4 turbo diesel available as options. In base trim the four-cylinder engine was backed by a four-speed manual transmission, with either a five-speed manual or three-speed TorqueFlite A904 automatic built by Chrysler as an option. The V6 engine was available with either the five-speed manual or the automatic, while the turbodiesel was only available with the five-speed.

The V6 was the same engine used in the competing Chevrolet S-10, and equipped with a two-barrel Rochester carburetor instead of the four-cylinder&#x27;s electronic throttle-body fuel injection system the optional six-cylinder was slightly less powerful than the standard four. The V6 thus offered little performance advantage over the base engine while penalizing the owner with poorer fuel economy. In the truck&#x27;s second year on the market the V6 was replaced by AMC&#x27;s new fuel-injected 4.0 L straight-six that developed and : 50% more power and 47% more torque than the previous V6. The new six-cylinder was also more fuel-efficient. The performance of the base 2.5 L engine was also improved with a new air intake, raising peak output to 121 hp and 141 lb⋅ft. The slow-selling turbodiesel option was dropped during the model year.

Concurrent with introduction of the new straight-six a new four-speed automatic built by Aisin-Warner replaced the former Chrysler three-speed. The 30-40LE featured electronic controls with a switch on the dashboard allowing the driver to choose between two performance modes: &quot;Power&quot;, in which the transmission downshifts more quickly and upshifts at higher rpm during hard acceleration, and &quot;Comfort&quot;, in which the upshifts are made at lower engine speeds to conserve fuel and reduce engine noise and vibration.

In 1988 output of the 4.0 L engine was improved slightly to 177 hp and 224 lb⋅ft.

Chrysler purchased AMC in 1987, and by the 1991 model year adapted their own engine control electronics to replace the original Renix systems used with the 2.5 L and 4.0 L engines. Power and torque in both engines improved as a result, with the four-cylinder having an additional 9 hp and 8 lb⋅ft and the six-cylinder improving by 1 lb⋅ft and 13 hp. The 4.0 L was badged &quot;High Output&quot; thereafter. As a result of the power improvements the Aisin-Warner automatic transmission&#x27;s output shaft was changed from 21 splines to 23, and the &quot;Power-Comfort&quot; switch was deleted. The four-cylinder was no longer available with the automatic in 1991 and 1992.

During the production life of the Comanche six different transmissions were offered, manufactured by Aisin, Chrysler, and Peugeot. Chrysler provided the aforementioned TorqueFlite 904 three-speed automatic in 1986 models. In addition to the aforementioned 30-40LE four-speed automatic Aisin also provided the AX-4 (four-speed), AX-5 and AX-15 (five-speed overdrive) manual transmissions. The AX-15 was phased in midway through the 1989 model year to replace the Peugeot BA10/5 five-speed that had been used behind the 4.0 L engine from its introduction in 1987.

Comanches were available in either two or four-wheel-drive, with solid axles front and rear (two-wheel-drive Comanches used a simple beam axle with otherwise the same front suspension as four-wheel-drive models). Transfer cases were built by New Process Gear, and the Comanche was available with either part-time &quot;Command-Trac&quot; or full-time &quot;Selec-Trac&quot; systems. In 1986 Command-Trac transfer cases were model NP207 and Selec-Trac were NP228, both with a 2.61:1 low gear ratios. In 1987 the NP207 was replaced with the NP231 and NP228 was replaced with the NP242, both with 2.72:1 low gears. These remained the same through the rest of the Comanche&#x27;s production.

==Phaseout and aborted name revival==
The decision to phase out the Jeep Comanche &quot;came from a combination of two factors— low sales and Chrysler&#x27;s attempts to make the Jeep brand fit into the Chrysler hierarchy of Plymouth, Dodge, and Chrysler models&quot; with Jeep housing SUVs and Dodge making trucks.

As sales dropped, the Comanche was planned for discontinuation. In 1990, the National Council of Jeep-Eagle dealers asked Chrysler to discontinue the Comanche, and allow them to sell a version of the Dodge Dakota pickup.

The company decided to cease production of the Comanche on June 12, 1992, after only a few thousand more trucks rolled off the Toledo, Ohio, assembly line. A total of 190,446 Comanches were made during its production run.

Following the discontinuation of the Comanche, the Dodge Ramcharger would be dropped outside of Mexico shortly afterwards as part of Chrysler&#x27;s plans to have Dodge sell pickup trucks and Jeep sell SUVs. Despite that, Dodge would later re-enter the SUV field with the Dodge Durango in 1998 at the height of the initial SUV boom and at one point would offer three SUVs or crossovers (Durango, Journey and Nitro, the latter being a rebadged version of the Jeep Liberty (KK)) while Jeep didn&#x27;t offer any pickup trucks. Dodge itself would stop offering pickup trucks in 2011 when the Ram Trucks brand was spun-off from Dodge, taking the Dodge Ram and Dakota with it.

Jeep re-entered the pickup truck market in early 2019 with the Wrangler-based Jeep Gladiator. Jeep actually considered reviving the Comanche name alongside Gladiator and most commonly Scrambler, as well as simply using a new name, before deciding on Gladiator, feeling it fits that truck the best; sensitivity to the Native Americans (specifically the Comanche tribe) and much less brand recognition compared to Jeep&#x27;s decades-long use of &quot;Cherokee&quot; for the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee also likely played factors. The new Gladiator will serve as a 27-year later replacement for the Comanche.

<text>Emperor Xiaozong of Song (27 November 1127 – 28 June 1194), personal name Zhao Shen, courtesy name Yuanyong, was the 11th emperor of the Song dynasty of China and the second emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He started his reign in 1162 when his adoptive father and predecessor, Emperor Gaozong, abdicated and passed the throne to him. Even though Emperor Gaozong became a &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (&quot;Retired Emperor&quot;) after his abdication, he remained the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler, so Emperor Xiaozong only took full power in 1187 after Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s death. After ruling for about a year, Emperor Xiaozong followed in his predecessor&#x27;s footsteps and abdicated in favour of his third son Zhao Dun (Emperor Guangzong), while he became &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; and still remained in power until his death in 1194.

He was the first descendant of Emperor Taizu to become emperor and remembered as an effective ruler as the Song enjoyed prosperity during his reign.

Zhao Shen&#x27;s birth name was Zhao Bocong (趙伯琮). In March 1133, after Zhao Bocong entered the imperial palace, his name was changed to Zhao Yuan (趙瑗). In April 1160, after Zhao Yuan was adopted by Emperor Gaozong, his name was changed to Zhao Wei (趙瑋). In July 1162, when Zhao Wei became crown prince, his name was changed again to Zhao Shen (趙眘).

Zhao Shen was given the courtesy name Yuangui (元瑰) in May 1160. In July 1162, when he became crown prince, his courtesy name was changed to Yuanyong (元永).

== Early life ==
Zhao Shen was a seventh-generation descendant of Emperor Taizu, the founder and first emperor of the Song dynasty. He was the second son of Zhao Zicheng (趙子偁; died 1143), a sixth cousin of Emperor Gaozong, the 10th Song emperor. After the Jingkang Incident in 1127, Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s father, eldest brother and most of his close relatives were taken prisoner by the Jurchen-led Jin Empire. As Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s only son, Zhao Fu (趙旉), died prematurely around the age of two, the emperor ordered his officials to start searching for other living descendants of the imperial family. Zhao Shen was discovered and adopted by Emperor Gaozong in April 1160 as a son. Another relative, Zhao Qu was also adopted. In July 1162, Emperor Gaozong officially designated Zhao Shen as his crown prince and heir apparent. One of the main reasons Gaozong chose Shen over Qu was of Shen&#x27;s virtue. It is said that Gaozong gave ten maids to Shen and Qu. In the end, Qu had touched every maid but Shen had not even touched one winning Gaozong&#x27;s favor over Qu.

In 24 July 1162, Emperor Gaozong abdicated in favor of Emperor Xiaozong who became emperor although Emperor Gaozong retained power as &quot;Taishang Huang&quot;.

== Reign ==
During the reign of Emperor Xiaozong, the Chinese increased the number of trade missions that would dock at ports throughout the Indian Ocean, where Arab and Hindu influence was once predominant. Xiaozong also was responsible for Yue Fei&#x27;s posthumous rehabilitation, clearing out the remnants of Qin Hui&#x27;s faction in court, and stabilizing the economy making his reign the most powerful era of the Southern Song Dynasty and it&#x27;s said he was the best ruler of the Southern Song dynasty.

Xiaozong&#x27;s reign was one of the few times in Southern Song that was not dominated by powerful officials, as he held power supreme and unchallenged. He was also a demanding emperor who frequently dismissed ministers without hesitation if they failed to meet his expectations. This led to many criticisms of the emperors personnel policy. In 1166, the lesser lord of agricultural supervision, Mo Chi remonstrated to the emperor, criticizing him for dismissing councilors and other officials only having served for a few months. The emperor commended Mo Chi for his criticism, but ignored it. One of the reasons behind Xiaozongs policy could have been to avoid the amassing of great power in the person of individual officials, such as the great power wielded by Qin Gui in Gaozong&#x27;s era, with a convenient way in achieving this to limit ministerial tenure of office so they could not build a base in court.

The Emperor also controlled his ministers by curtailing their authority. Early in 1167 the Emperor finally filled every vacancy in the Council of State by appointing chief councilors of the left and right and two assistant councilors. The bureaucracy was generally pleased with the appointments, but the remarks of the vice-minister for war, Chen Yanxiao, contained both jubilations over the appointments but skepticism over the reduced powers of the councilors. Although Xiaozong is said to have listened to Chen, he never put his advice into practice. Throughout the Xiaozong reign the chief complaint of officials was his is tendency to infringe on their authority. Xiaozong in principle realized the importance of treating his councilors with dignity and granting them executive authority, however in reality his participation in all major decisions greatly limited their authority. In 1163 chief councilors were appointed to positions of Commissioners of military affairs, and in 1167 they were also granted financial authority with the titles of controller of national finance (&quot;Zhi Guoyongshi&quot;). Later in Southern Song this contributed to the power of the chief councilors, however during Xiaozongs reign this was not the case. Xiaozong intended for his ministers to exercise their powers in ordinary administrative affairs, however the emperor was in the habit of guarding his imperial prerogatives and frequently exercised them especially in military matters. As in 1167 when Imperial orders issued to the Bureau of Military affairs bypassed the Secretariat and Imperial Councilors and went straight to the Imperial Chancellery. After requests to the Emperor that orders go through regular bureaucratic streams he promised to rectify this, but instead to continued to issue direct dispatches as &quot;confidential orders&quot; (&quot;mi-pai&quot;). Xiaozong began to directly issue palace orders (&quot;nei-pi&quot;) and imperial decrees (&quot;yu-pi&quot;) without prior consultation with councilors to enhance his power in other areas.

According to Dieter Kuhn, Emperor Xiaozong &quot;is said to have spent ten sleepless years after issuing huizi&quot; and was the main driving power behind attempts to stabilize the monetary system. In 1166 the Emperor bought back two million silver ounces worth of circulating &quot;huizi&quot; and had them burned, as well as decreeing that paper notes could be accepted for payment of taxes and fees. Xiaozong in these policies tried to regulate the market value of paper currency by limiting the quantity in circulation. These policies to curb inflation proved effective, and in 1175 he managed to stabilize the value of &quot;huizi&quot;. In 1178 Huang Chouruo stated in a report to the throne: “If [huizi] are few, they are expensive, if there are many, they are cheap.” In 1186 there were around 20 million strings of cash in issue. He closely supervised the court and central government to make sure power remained balance among high officials and tried in earnest to live up to Confucian standards of moral behavior.

Archery and equestrianism were required for non-military officials at the Military College in 1162 during Emperor Xiaozong&#x27;s reign.

In 1165, he reached peace with the Jin Dynasty.

In the Southern Song years, revenue from state monopolies on tea, salt, and &quot;jiu&quot;, along with commercial taxes, was crucial to the state&#x27;s finances and was increasing. During Emperor Xiaozong&#x27;s late Chunxi period, summer and autumn agricultural land taxes dropped to 20.4 percent and 15.3 percent of total revenue of the government compared from the reign of Emperor Shenzong.

In 1187, the retired Emperor Gaozong died. Xiaozong was stricken with grief and retreated from governing, insisting on mourning Gaozong and stating that he would only rule for two more years. Xiaozong turned all government affairs to his son Zhao Dun.

In 1189, Emperor Xiaozong abdicated in favour of his son, Zhao Dun who took the throne as Emperor Guangzong. He then granted himself the title &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; and remained as the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler. Xiaozong is also said to have been suffering from mental illness in the last two years of his reign, which encouraged him to follow the example of his stepfather Gaozong and retire.

== As Retired Emperor ==
His daughter-in-law Empress Li reportedly attempted to keep Emperor Guangzong and his father (Xiaozong) separate, and often stopped the emperor from seeing his father. On one occasion, at the sickbed of the emperor, her father-in-law threatened to have her executed for not taking proper care of the monarch.

Retired Emperor Xiaozong fell ill in 1194 and was made worse when Emperor Guangzong refused to visit him. Xiaozong soon died. Emperor Guangzong refused to attend his funeral and as a result, was forced to give his throne to the deceased retired emperor&#x27;s grandson Emperor Ningzong.

<doc id="1162543" wikidata="Q900625" url="?curid=1162543" title="Quantum efficiency">
<text>The term quantum efficiency (QE) may apply to incident photon to converted electron (IPCE) ratio of a photosensitive device, or it may refer to the TMR effect of a magnetic tunnel junction.

This article deals with the term as a measurement of a device&#x27;s electrical sensitivity to light. In a charge-coupled device (CCD) or other photodetector, it is the ratio between the number of charge carriers collected at either terminal and the number of photons hitting the device&#x27;s photoreactive surface. As a ratio, QE is dimensionless, but it is closely related to the responsivity, which is expressed in amps per watt. Since the energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength, QE is often measured over a range of different wavelengths to characterize a device&#x27;s efficiency at each photon energy level. For typical semiconductor photodetectors, QE drops to zero for photons whose energy is below the band gap. A photographic film typically has a QE of much less than 10%, while CCDs can have a QE of well over 90% at some wavelengths.

==QE of solar cells==
A solar cell&#x27;s quantum efficiency value indicates the amount of current that the cell will produce when irradiated by photons of a particular wavelength. If the cell&#x27;s quantum efficiency is integrated over the whole solar electromagnetic spectrum, one can evaluate the amount of current that the cell will produce when exposed to sunlight. The ratio between this energy-production value and the highest possible energy-production value for the cell (i.e., if the QE were 100% over the whole spectrum) gives the cell&#x27;s overall energy conversion efficiency value. Note that in the event of multiple exciton generation (MEG), quantum efficiencies of greater than 100% may be achieved since the incident photons have more than twice the band gap energy and can create two or more electron-hole pairs per incident photon.

===Types===
Two types of quantum efficiency of a solar cell are often considered:

*External quantum efficiency (EQE) is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy &quot;shining on the solar cell from outside&quot; (incident photons).
*Internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons of a given energy that shine on the solar cell from outside &quot;and&quot; are absorbed by the cell.

The IQE is always larger than the EQE in the visible spectrum. A low IQE indicates that the active layer of the solar cell is unable to make good use of the photons, most likely due to poor carrier collection efficiency. To measure the IQE, one first measures the EQE of the solar device, then measures its transmission and reflection, and combines these data to infer the IQE.
formula_1
formula_2

The external quantum efficiency therefore depends on both the absorption of light and the collection of charges. Once a photon has been absorbed and has generated an electron-hole pair, these charges must be separated and collected at the junction. A &quot;good&quot; material avoids charge recombination. Charge recombination causes a drop in the external quantum efficiency.

The ideal quantum efficiency graph has a square shape, where the QE value is fairly constant across the entire spectrum of wavelengths measured. However, the QE for most solar cells is reduced because of the effects of recombination, where charge carriers are not able to move into an external circuit. The same mechanisms that affect the collection probability also affect the QE. For example, modifying the front surface can affect carriers generated near the surface. Highly doped front surface layers can also cause &#x27;free carrier absorption&#x27; which reduces QE in the longer wavelengths. And because high-energy (blue) light is absorbed very close to the surface, considerable recombination at the front surface will affect the &quot;blue&quot; portion of the QE. Similarly, lower energy (green) light is absorbed in the bulk of a solar cell, and a low diffusion length will affect the collection probability from the solar cell bulk, reducing the QE in the green portion of the spectrum. Generally, solar cells on the market today do not produce much electricity from ultraviolet and infrared light (&lt;400 nm and &gt;1100 nm wavelengths, respectively); these wavelengths of light are either filtered out or are absorbed by the cell, thus heating the cell. That heat is wasted energy, and could damage the cell.

==QE of image sensors==
Quantum efficiency (QE) is the fraction of photon flux that contributes to the photocurrent in a photodetector or
a pixel. Quantum efficiency is one of the most important parameters used to evaluate the quality of a detector and is often called the spectral response to reflect its wavelength dependence. It is defined as the number of signal electrons created per incident photon. In some cases it can exceed 100% (i.e. when more than one electron is created per incident photon).

===EQE mapping===
Conventional measurement of the EQE will give the efficiency of the overall device. However it is often useful to have a map of the EQE over large area of the device. This mapping provides an efficient way to visualize the homogeneity and/or the defects in the sample. It was realized by researchers from the Institute of Researcher and Development on Photovoltaic Energy (IRDEP) who calculated the EQE mapping from electroluminescence measurements taken with a hyperspectral imager.

==Spectral responsivity==
Spectral responsivity is a similar measurement, but it has different units: amperes per watt (A/W); (i.e. how much current comes out of the device per unit of incident light power). Responsivity is ordinarily specified for monochromatic light (i.e. light of a single wavelength). Both the quantum efficiency and the responsivity are functions of the photons&#x27; wavelength (indicated by the subscript λ).

To convert from responsivity (, in A/W) to QEλ (on a scale 0 to 1):
formula_3
where is the wavelength in nm, &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &quot;e&quot; is the elementary charge. Note that the unit W/A (watts per ampere) is equivalent to V (volts).

===Determination===
formula_4
where formula_5 = number of electrons produced, formula_6 = number of photons absorbed.
formula_7

Assuming each photon absorbed in the depletion layer produces a viable electron-hole pair, and all other photons do not,
formula_8
where &quot;t&quot; is the measurement time (in seconds), 
formula_9 = incident optical power in watts, 
formula_10 = optical power absorbed in depletion layer, also in watts.

<doc id="1162557" wikidata="Q2410433" url="?curid=1162557" title="Chinley">
<text>Chinley is a rural village in the High Peak Borough of Derbyshire, England, with a population of 2,796 at the 2011 Census. Most of the civil parish (called Chinley, Buxworth and Brownside) is within the Peak District National Park. Historically, before the coming of the railway, the area was economically dominated by agriculture. Nowadays most inhabitants commute out of the village to work; accessible centres of work include Stockport, Sheffield and Manchester.

==Location==

Chinley lies in the Blackbrook Valley. To the north is Cracken Edge, a once-quarried promontory of Chinley Churn, a large, prominent hill with a pass followed by the A624 named Chinley Head. Brown Knoll commands the skyline on the eastern border of the civil parish, with South Head and Mount Famine to the north-east. An old winding engine can still be seen atop an incline on the north-eastern face of Cracken Edge. Immediately south of the village, brook and parish border is Eccles Pike, an almost-conical hill, partly owned by the National Trust.

Filling the upper end of the valley to the southeast is Chapel-en-le-Frith, more than twice the size of Chinley in area and in population. Other nearby towns include Whaley Bridge ( west), New Mills ( northwest), Glossop ( north) and Buxton ( south). Buxworth in the same civil parish is the location of Bugsworth Basin on the Peak Forest Canal. Buxton Road to the east (bypassed here by the A6 through Whitehough) leads to the small settlement of New Smithy, beyond which the road turns south to Chapel Milton before crossing the Black Brook and continuing south into Chapel-en-le-Frith.

The boundary of the Peak District National Park runs up the middle of Stubbins Lane and part of Maynestone Road, before crossing down into the valley and over Otter Brook, towards Wash.

==Transport==

Chinley railway station has a single island platform on the trans-Pennine Hope Valley Line between Sheffield and Manchester Piccadilly. The typical service is one train every hour each way to Sheffield and to Manchester Piccadilly, operated by Northern Trains. It is one of only two stations between Stockport and Sheffield where East Midlands Railway express trains stop in peak hours. 

The coming of the railways was the reason Chinley grew from the tiny hamlet it had been and the village is actually named after its railway station. Previously, the names &quot;Maynestonefield&quot; or &quot;Four Lanes End&quot; were used. Chinley station was once an important railway junction on the Midland Railway&#x27;s Dore and Chinley (or Hope Valley) line; it had a London-bound extension through Millers Dale and it was common to have to change trains in Chinley en route to Manchester, London or Sheffield. 

==Amenities==

Chinley has a primary school; a small residential special school; an active village community centre and a Women&#x27;s Institute hall; two village greens (one was formerly the bowling green); two parks, one of which is a local nature reserve; and a small collection of shops, including an Indian restaurant, tea shop, cheese shop, pizzeria and a fish and chip shop.

Chinley Juniors Football Club plays its games at Chinley Community Centre. Chinley Churners cycling club is officially affiliated to British Cycling and boasts members of all ages.

==Notable buildings and constructions==

Chinley Independent Chapel, on the southeastern edge of Chinley adjacent to Chapel Milton, was built in 1711. The chapel was established by William Bagshaw as a nonconformist church in 1662, and is still the home of the local Congregational church. It has simple furnishings and a pulpit near the centre of the building.

The route of the Peak Forest Tramway (in use from 1796–1923), an early horse-and-gravity-powered railway, runs along the southern edge of Chinley near the Black Brook. The one remaining entrance to the Stodhart Tunnel, one of the oldest railway tunnels in Britain, is just inside the entrance to Chapel Lodge nursing home, on the road between Chapel Milton and Chapel-en-le-Frith (in the latter parish). Part of the route is used as a road for testing car brakes by Ferodo, a local manufacturer of brakes and car parts. There are ruins or conversions of a few mills — one still in use as a plastics factory — and one or two large manor-style homes near the route.

The fine stone building of Chinley railway station was dismantled in 1902 and re-erected as a private house on Maynestone Road on the northeast edge of Chinley.

The Old Hall in the nearby hamlet of Whitehough, across the Black Brook to the south, dates from Elizabethan times and, with the adjacent 400-year-old licensed premises, forms part of the Old Hall Inn. A King&#x27;s Mill stood alongside the Black Brook in Chapel Milton for around 700 years, but was destroyed in 1946 to allow construction of a water treatment facility for Ferodo.

A small cattle market was developed on the south side of the railway, near the station, in the early 19th century by a local farmers&#x27; co-operative society. It was conducted by Brady &amp; Son of Stockport, who could access it conveniently from Tiviot Dale station on the Midland Railway. It closed before the Second World War.

==Notable people==
John Bennet (1714–1759), described as &quot;one of John Wesley&#x27;s most outstanding young preachers&quot;, was born at Chinley and lived at Lee End. Bennet and his wife Grace Murray are buried in the graveyard of nearby Chinley Chapel.

Charles Wesley visited Chinley regularly; it is said he was in love with Grace Murray.

George Kirk of the Old Hall, Whitehough was groom to the Royal Bedchamber of King Charles I, and was present when the king was beheaded in 1649.

Edwina Currie, former Conservative minister, winner of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; and author, moved to Whitehough in 2010, but moved to nearby Whaley Bridge in 2012.

Constance Felicity Goddard (1881–1954), novelist and poet. Daughter of Mary Ann and James Goddard, dairy farmer, of Heatherlea, Maynestone Road. Novels included &quot;Dear Charity&quot; (1922), &quot;Silver Woods&quot; (1939), &quot;Come Wind Come Weather&quot; (1945), &quot;Three at Cherry-Go-Gay&quot; (1949). A review in &quot;The Spectator&quot; compared her work to that of Alison Uttley and Flora Thompson. Her &quot;Poems&quot; were published in 1929.

Eric Hollies (1912–1981), cricketer. A Warwickshire and England leg-break bowler who dismissed Don Bradman in his final Test innings, he died in Chinley aged 68.

<doc id="1162559" wikidata="Q4910053" url="?curid=1162559" title="Bill Mauro">
<text>William Joseph Mauro (born ) is a Canadian politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as the 9th mayor of Thunder Bay from 2018 to 2022. He was previously a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2018, representing the riding of Thunder Bay—Atikokan and serving as a cabinet minister in the government of Kathleen Wynne.

== Background ==
Mauro was educated at Lakehead University teacher&#x27;s college in Thunder Bay, and worked as a property manager for fourteen years before entering provincial politics. He served as a city councillor on the Thunder Bay City Council from 1997 to 2003, and was a member of the Thunder Bay Hydro board and the Thunder Bay Regional Hospital.

== Politics ==
In the provincial election of 2003, Mauro was elected as a Liberal in Thunder Bay—Atikokan. He defeated his New Democrat candidate John Rafferty by over 11,000 votes. In the 2007 election he faced Rafferty again this time by a narrow margin of 50 votes. He was easily re-elected in the 2011, and 2014 elections. In the 2018 election, he lost his seat to New Democrat Judith Monteith-Farrell by just 81 votes.

During his time in government he has served in several Parliamentary Assistant roles assisting ministers including the Minister of Northern Development and Mines (2003–2007, 2011–2013) and the Minister of Natural Resources (2007–2009). On March 25, 2014, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed Mauro as Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. On June 24 after the election she appointed Mauro as the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. After fellow cabinet minister Michael Gravelle temporarily stepped aside in February 2017, Mauro also took over his duties as Ministry of Northern Development and Mines on a temporary basis.

In 2004, he announced that the provincial government would be spending almost $1 million to improve Thunder Bay&#x27;s transportation service. He is also known to favour a return of the spring bear hunt.

Following his defeat in the 2018 provincial election, he announced his candidacy for mayor in the 2018 municipal election. He won that election, and became mayor of the city on December 1, 2018. Mauro did not seek re-election as Mayor in the 2022 municipal elections.

<doc id="1162568" wikidata="Q364584" url="?curid=1162568" title="Gunter rig">
<text>Gunter rig is a configuration of sail and spars used in sailing. It is a fore and aft sail set abaft (behind) the mast. The lower half of the luff (front) of the sail is attached to the mast, and the upper half is fastened to a spar which is approximately vertical and reaches above the top of the mast. This spar is called a &quot;yard&quot;, but it is common for some to confuse it with a &quot;gaff&quot; (as in gaff rig). The overall shape of a gunter sail is roughly triangular, so having a superficial resemblance to Bermuda rig.

A gunter sail may also be called a &quot;gunter lug&quot; - a name which suggests developmental origins from increasing the angle of a high peaked standing lug. Gunter sails are sometimes described as &quot;sliding gunter&quot;.

Gunter rig is generally used in small sailing craft. One important advantage is that the shorter mast used with this rig usually fits within the hull when unstepped, together with the boom and yard. This is helpful for a dinghy that is towed behind a car, stored in a garage, or used as a tender for a larger boat. The performance to windward comes close to that of Bermuda rig. Gunter rig can be found in a few working craft, but the majority of uses are in pleasure craft.

There are many variations of gunter rig: the most fundamental of which include whether the sail is hoisted with one or two halyards, and the ease with which reefs can be taken in.

==General characteristics==
Gunter rig exists in several forms. In all of them, the un-reefed sail is extended above the top of the mast by the yard, giving a sail shape that is close to three sided. When the boat is not in use, this allows the mast and yard to be stored within the hull of the majority of gunter-rigged boats. Afloat, the centre of gravity of the masts and spars is lowered as the sail is reefed, unlike Bermuda rig. This is helpful to sea-worthiness in rougher conditions.

The earliest form was the sliding gunter. The yard is connected to the mast by two &quot;gunter irons&quot;. The top iron is attached to the yard just below where the single halyard turns over the sheave at the mast-head; the lower iron is at the lower end of the yard. This arrangement keeps the yard parallel to the mast and able to slide up and down as the sail is hoisted, lowered or reefed. The benefit of this is that the yard is under better control as sail is lowered (thereby avoiding a hazard to the crew). The disadvantage is that lowering sail is a two stage process, as the yard has to be disconnected from the top gunter iron to get all the sail off the boat. There is also a risk of the gunter irons jamming. Some of these problems are resolved if the sail is boomless or loose-footed and can be taken in with brails.

A two halyard system does away with the gunter irons. The peak halyard goes to a wire span on the yard and holds the yard close to the mast. A throat halyard moves the yard up and down the mast. The lower end of the yard is usually attached to the mast with jaws and a parrel. This allows the rig to be put together with more readily available components. In use, the sail can be lowered completely quite quickly. Reefing is carried out by lowering away solely on the throat halyard. Unlike gaff rig, this two halyard system is easier for a single-hander, as only one halyard is used at a time.

A simpler and more minimalist arrangement is to have a single halyard that is tied to the yard at a mid-point.This attachment point has to be varied if the sail is reefed, so reefing can only be done by completely lowering the sail, moving position of the halyard and re-hoisting once the reef points are tied.

<doc id="1162573" wikidata="Q4346887" url="?curid=1162573" title="Thirty-two-bar form">
<text>The 32-[[Bar (music)|bar]] form, also known as the AABA song form, American popular song form and the ballad form, is a song structure commonly found in Tin Pan Alley songs and other American popular music, especially in the first half of the 20th century.

As its alternative name &quot;AABA&quot; implies, this song form consists of four sections: an eight-bar A section; a second eight-bar A section (which may have slight changes from the first A section); an eight-bar B section, often with contrasting harmony or &quot;feel&quot;; and a final eight-bar A section. The core melody line is generally retained in each A section, although variations may be added, particularly for the last A section.

Examples of 32-bar AABA form songs include &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do&quot;, &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot;, &quot;The Man I Love&quot;, &quot;Dream River&quot;, &quot;Primrose Lane&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Away From It All&quot;, and &quot;Blue Skies&quot;. Many show tunes that have become jazz standards are 32-bar song forms.

== Basic song form ==
At its core, the basic AABA 32-bar song form consists of four sections, each section being eight bars in length, totaling 32 bars. Each of these eight-bar sections is assigned a letter name (&quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;), based on its melodic and harmonic content. The A sections all share the same melody (possibly with slight variations), and the recurring title lyric typically falls on either the first or last line of each A section. The &quot;B&quot; section musically and lyrically contrasts the A sections, and may or may not contain the title lyric. The &quot;B&quot; section may use a different harmony that contrasts with the harmony of the A sections. For example in the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Rhythm&quot;, the A sections are in the key of B, but the B section involves a circle of fifths series of dominant seventh chords going from D7, G7, C7, to F7. Song form terminology is not standardized, and the B section is also referred to as the &quot;middle eight&quot;, &quot;bridge&quot;, or &quot;primary bridge&quot;.

The song form of &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do&quot; by Irving Berlin is as follows:

== Terminology ==

=== Sectional verse ===
Some Tin Pan Alley songs composed as numbers for musicals precede the main tune with what was called a &quot;sectional verse&quot; or &quot;introductory verse&quot; in the terminology of the early 20th century. This introductory section is usually 16 bars long and establishes the background and mood of the number, with a free musical structure, speech-like rhythms, and rubato delivery, in order to highlight the attractions of the main tune. Some verses contained a second set of lyrics intended to be sung between repeated performances of the main chorus. The sectional verse is often omitted from modern performances. It is not assigned a letter in the &quot;AABA&quot; naming scheme.

The introductory verse from &quot;What&#x27;ll I Do&quot; by Irving Berlin is as follows:

Gone is the romance that was so divine,&lt;br&gt;&#x27;tis broken and cannot be mended&lt;br&gt;You must go your way, and I must go mine,&lt;br&gt;but now that our love dreams have ended...
=== Bridge ===

In music theory, the middle eight or bridge is the B section of a 32-bar form. This section has a significantly different melody from the rest of the song and usually occurs after the second &quot;A&quot; section in the AABA song form. It is also called a middle eight because it happens in the middle of the song and the length is generally eight bars.

=== Terminological confusion ===
In early-20th-century terminology, the main 32-bar AABA section, in its entirety, was called the &quot;refrain&quot; or &quot;chorus&quot;. Accordingly, jazz players improvising on the 32-bar sections may still speak today of &quot;blowing for a couple of choruses&quot;. This is in contrast to the modern usage of the term &quot;chorus&quot;, which refers to a repeating musical and lyrical section in verse–chorus form. Additionally, &quot;verse&quot;, &quot;chorus&quot;, and &quot;refrain&quot; all have different meanings in modern musical terminology. See the below chart for clarification:

== History ==

Though the 32-bar form resembles the ternary form of the operatic da capo aria, it did not become common until the late 1910s. It became &quot;the principal form&quot; of American popular song around 1925–1926, with the AABA form consisting of the chorus or the entirety of many songs in the early 20th century. It was commonly used by composers George Gershwin (for example, in &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot; from 1930), Cole Porter, and Jerome Kern, and it dominated American popular music into the 1950s.

The 32-bar form was often used in rock in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, after which verse–chorus form became more prevalent. Examples include:
*Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; (1957)
*The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot; (1958)
*The Shirelles&#x27; &quot;Will You Love Me Tomorrow&quot; (1960)
*The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Surfer Girl&quot; (1963)

Though more prevalent in the first half of the 20th century, many contemporary songs show similarity to the form, such as &quot;Memory&quot; from &quot;Cats&quot;, which features expanded form through the B and A sections repeated in new keys. Songwriters such as Lennon–McCartney and those working in the Brill Building also used modified or extended 32-bar forms, often modifying the number of measures in individual or all sections. The Beatles (&quot;From Me to You&quot; [1963] and &quot;Yesterday&quot; [1965]), like many others, would extend the form with an instrumental section, second bridge, break or reprise of the introduction, etc., and another return to the main theme. Introductions and codas also extended the form. In &quot;South of the Border Down Mexico Way&quot; by Gene Autry, &quot;the A sections… are doubled in length, to sixteen bars—but this affects the overall scheme only marginally&quot;. The theme tune of the long-running British TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; has, in some incarnations, followed 32-bar form.

<doc id="1162583" wikidata="Q4773314" url="?curid=1162583" title="Anthony Pulis">
<text>Anthony James Pulis (born 21 July 1984) is a Welsh football coach and former player. He is currently an assistant coach for Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake.

A journeyman for much of his career Pulis represented Portsmouth, Stoke City, Torquay United, Plymouth Argyle, Grimsby Town, Bristol Rovers, Southampton, Lincoln City, Stockport County, Barnet and Aldershot Town during 10 years spent playing in England before moving abroad and establishing himself in the USL Pro with Orlando City. He made four appearances for the Wales under-21 team, but did not represent his country at senior level.

==Club career==
===Portsmouth===
Bristol-born Pulis began his career in 2000 as a trainee with Portsmouth whilst his father Tony managed the club. Despite his father&#x27;s sacking after only 10 months in charge, Anthony stayed at Fratton Park, turning professional in July 2002 under Harry Redknapp. He made just one first team appearance for Pompey as a substitute in the 2–0 League Cup win away to Cardiff City on 9 November 2004.

===Stoke City===
In December 2004, after failing to make an impact on the Portsmouth first team, Anthony Pulis and teammate Lewis Buxton each signed two-and-a-half-year contracts with Stoke City.

Almost immediately after his arrival at Stoke, Anthony joined Torquay United on loan, making his league debut as a first-half substitute for Alex Russell as Torquay lost 2–1 at home to Stockport County on 1 January 2005. However his appearances were limited and his loan spell was cut short.

Pulis once again found his first team opportunities scarce after his father was dismissed and replaced by Johan Boskamp prior to the 2005–06 season. Towards the end of the 2005–06 season he was loaned to Plymouth Argyle, linking up with his father for the third time in his career.

After his loan spell, Pulis returned to the Britannia Stadium for the 2006–07 season. He moved, along with Martin Paterson, to Grimsby Town on loan on 23 November 2006. However, he made only nine appearances before his loan spell was cut short due to injury. In his second-last appearance, he was substituted at half-time as Grimsby suffered a 4–0 loss to Rochdale.

The 2007–08 season started brightly for Pulis. He gained his first assist for the club, as his corner set up a Jon Parkin header in a 3–2 defeat to Southampton, however injury problems kept him sidelined for several months thereafter. He was loaned out again, on this occasion to Bristol Rovers, however he made only one appearance for the club before his loan spell was curtailed due to another injury. In his only appearance for the club, a 14-minute cameo in a 2–0 defeat to Doncaster Rovers, Pulis conceded a penalty kick and was booked.

===Southampton===
In August 2008 Pulis moved to Southampton on a two-year contract a free transfer.

He joined League Two team Lincoln City on one-month loan in October 2009 making his debut on 10 October in a 1–0 away win against Macclesfield Town. Pulis became an instant first team regular at Lincoln but left the club when his loan contract expired on 7 January 2010. He had spent the previous six weeks on the injured list.

In October 2010, he joined Stockport County on loan for a month and made his debut for the club on 9 October 2010 in a match against Gillingham, a club his father managed, in which he scored a consolation goal for Stockport. The loan was extended into a second and third month.

Pulis joined Barnet on loan in February 2011 but was sent off 29 minutes into his debut, a 3–0 defeat at home to Torquay United.

Anthony Pulis was released by Southampton on 21 May 2011, without making an first team appearances.

<text>Asaphus kowalewskii () is one of the 35 species of trilobites of the genus &quot;Asaphus&quot; (this particular species is sometimes placed in its own genus, &quot;Neoasaphus&quot;). Fossils of this species are popular among collectors because of their prominent stalked eyes (termed &quot;peduncles&quot;), many an inch or more in length.

In the Ordovician period, an inland sea formed in what is now Eastern Europe. The sea contained a remarkably diverse trilobite fauna. Over a dozen species of &quot;Asaphus&quot; developed in this sea, with many species, including unrelated species, developing long eyestalks in various lengths. That so many species of trilobite developed eyestalks suggests that they were trying to overcome increased turbidity, or there was some sort of massive selective pressure leading these trilobites to bury themselves in the substrate up to their eyes. This species may have lain in wait buried in a benthic layer of loose debris or sediment with only its periscope eyestalks protruding above, looking out for danger or prey.
The fossils of this species are found only in the middle Ordovician deposits of the Volkhov River region near Saint Petersburg, Russia.

<doc id="1162592" wikidata="Q313740" url="?curid=1162592" title="Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet">
<text>The Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet is a light attack jet and advanced jet trainer co-manufactured by Dassault Aviation of France and Dornier Flugzeugwerke of Germany. It was developed specifically to perform trainer and light attack missions, as well as to perform these duties more ideally than the first generation of jet trainers that preceded it. Following a competition, a design submitted by a team comprising Breguet Aviation, Dassault Aviation, and Dornier Flugzeugwerke, initially designated as the &quot;TA501&quot;, was selected and subsequently produced as the Alpha Jet.

Both the French Air and Space Force and West German Air Force procured the Alpha Jet in large numbers, the former principally as a trainer aircraft and the latter choosing to use it as a light attack platform. As a result of post-Cold War military cutbacks, Germany elected to retire its own fleet of Alpha Jets in the 1990s and has re-sold many of these aircraft to both military and civilian operators. The Alpha Jet has been adopted by a number of air forces across the world and has also seen active combat use by some of these operators.

==Development==
===Origins===
In the early 1960s, European air forces began to consider their requirements for the coming decades. One such area of consideration was the requirement for a new generation of jet-powered trainer aircraft to replace such aircraft as the US-built Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star and French-built Fouga Magister. Britain and France established a collaborative program to pursue development of what was initially intended to become a supersonic jet aircraft. This aircraft was to be produced in two distinct variants for different roles: trainer and light attack aircraft. The result of this collaboration, the SEPECAT Jaguar, proved to be an excellent aircraft, but its definition had changed in the interim, and the type emerged as a full-sized, nuclear-capable strike fighter, whose two-seat variants were used for operational conversion to the type. As such, the Jaguar was not well suited for the general training mission.

This left the original requirement unfulfilled. As a result of this outcome, in 1967, France entered into a series of discussions with West Germany on the topic of a prospective collaboration effort to meet this demand. West Germany was keen to participate in such talks, having long held an interest in conducting joint training operations with France along with a desire for strengthening positive political relations between the two nations. France also valued military cooperation with West Germany, wanting to break a perceived German ideological preference for American aircraft. 

In 1968, a joint specification was produced out of these talks. One substantial change to the requirements was that the sought trainer was now specified to be subsonic, supersonic trainer aircraft having proven to be superfluous to practical requirements. In July 1969, a joint development and production agreement was signed between West Germany and France. Under the terms of this agreement, the two nations committed to purchasing 200 aircraft, these being domestically assembled in each of their own countries.

At one point, both the German government and the German Air Force had been keen to relocate pilot training activities from the United States to France as part of the project. In 1971, this was abandoned over fears of a hostile US reaction and West Germany&#x27;s offset obligations to the United States making such a move unpalatable. While the joint Franco-German training proposal was abandoned, the German government felt obligated to proceed with the aircraft program. At the time, Germany did not require a new trainer aircraft, but needed a replacement for its fleet of Fiat G.91 attack aircraft. 

Germany proposed that the aircraft be built in two distinct versions, as an inexpensive trainer for the French requirement, and as a close air support platform for the German requirement. This position was accepted by France. An initial point of contention whether to use a French or American powerplant for the aircraft was settled, with France agreeing to solely finance the development of the French-built Larzac engine while Germany agreed to adopt the same powerplant.

Three groups of manufacturers produced proposals in response to the requirement. These were Dassault, Breguet and Dornier submitted the &quot;TA501&quot;, which had been developed through a merger of the Breguet 126 and Dornier P.375 concepts. VFW-Fokker submitted their &quot;VFT-291&quot; aircraft, while SNIAS/MBB submitted the &quot;E.650 Eurotrainer&quot;. Each of these proposals were to be powered by twin SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac turbofan engines. The German Air Force insisted that the trainer have two engines after having suffered from severe aircraft attrition rates due to the high accident rate of the single-engine Lockheed F-104 Starfighter.

===Into production===

On 23 July 1970, the Breguet-Dassault-Dornier TA501 was declared the winner of the competition. In February 1971, the project definition phase was completed and the integrated design team was set up at Saint-Cloud, Paris, France. That same month, a join Franco-German protocol was signed, launching the construction of four prototypes. In February 1972, the approval to proceed with full development was issued. In May 1972, the first project meeting was held in Bordeaux, at which the order for the four prototypes was placed. In November 1972, the project passed its first mock-up review. Dassault was designated as the &#x27;pilot&#x27; company for the project and possessed final authority on design and management decisions. This approach to project management has been claimed to have been a mostly efficient manner of running the program.
Two prototypes were to be built by Dassault in France, Dassault having bought out Breguet in the meantime, and a further two were to be built by Dornier in Germany. In October 1973, the first French prototype performed its first flight at Istres, Marseille. In January 1974, the first German prototype conducted its maiden flight from Oberpfaffenhofen, Bavaria. The remaining two prototypes were in the air before the end of 1974. The first and second prototypes were used to explore the aircraft&#x27;s flight envelope, the third prototype was fitted with the French trainer equipment fit and the fourth with the German close air support equipment. The prototypes were equipped with recording and telemetry equipment packages, allowing for instrumentation readings and other useful data to be received on the ground in real time during test flights.

Manufacture of Alpha Jet sub-assemblies was divided between France (Dassault), Germany (Dornier) and Belgium (SABCA), each country performing final assembly and checkout of the type in separate facilities. Dassault hosted the largest of these three assembly lines, typically producing 13 aircraft per month to meet the needs of French and export customers. It was reportedly capable of a maximum output of 15 Alpha Jets per month. The Dornier final assembly line typically maintained a maximum rate of six aircraft per month. In contrast to the final assembly arrangements, none of the three sources duplicated the manufacture of any component: Dassault-Breguet produced the front and center fuselage, Dornier constructed the wing, tail and rear fuselage, while SABCA manufactured the nose and flaps of the aircraft. A total of 4,500 people were employed in the manufacturing of the Alpha Jet in Germany, an equal number in France also worked on the programme.

Both Belgium and Egypt, who were early export customers for the Alpha Jet, domestically performed the final assembly of their French-configuration Alpha Jet E aircraft. In September 1978, Dassault and the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) signed a license manufacturing agreement for the Alpha Jet. Egyptian assembly work was carried out in a facility in Helwan, Egypt. In July 1978, Dassault signed an agreement with American aircraft manufacture Lockheed to market the Alpha Jet in the US market. The arrangement included provisions for Lockheed to manufacture the Alpha Jet under license. It was considered as a candidate for the US Navy&#x27;s VTXTS advanced trainer program, eventually won by the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, a modified version of the Hawker Siddeley Hawk. Proposed modifications included undercarriage changes for nose-tow catapults and a stronger arrestor hook, as well as various US-sourced avionics and other equipment.

On 4 November 1977, the first production aircraft made its first flight. In September 1978, deliveries of production Alpha Jets began. The four prototypes remained in service as flying testbeds, being used for further development of the type such as to evaluate a composite graphite-epoxy wing and improved versions of the Larzac engine. Prototype 01 was specifically used early on to support the development of the Larzac engine. The different avionics fit makes French and German Alpha Jets relatively easy to visually distinguish the two, with French planes featuring a rounded-off nose and German ones featuring a sharp, pointed nose.

===Further development===
In 1980, work began on an &quot;Alternate Close Support&quot; version of the Alpha Jet, featuring a SAGEM ULISS 81 INS, a Thomson-CSF VE-110 HUD, a TMV630 laser rangefinder in a modified nose and a TRT AHV 9 radio altimeter, with all avionics linked through a digital databus. The initial flight was in April 1982. Cameroon obtained seven, some sources claim 6, and Egypt obtained 15. As with the original Egyptian order for MS1 machines, Dassault provided four such machines under the designation of &quot;MS2&quot;, and AOI of Egypt assembled the other eleven from knockdown kits.

The &quot;Alpha Jet 2&quot;, originally the &quot;Alpha Jet NGEA&quot; (&quot;Nouvelle Generation Appui/Ecole&quot; or &quot;New Generation Attack/Training&quot;) was a proposed development of the Alpha Jet. It featured the basic avionics of the MS2 plus compatibility with the advanced French Matra Magic 2 AAMs and the more powerful Larzac 04-C20 turbofans refitted to Luftwaffe Alpha Jet A aircraft. Some of the aircraft&#x27;s new avionics were derived from the Dassault Mirage 2000 fighter. In 1982, it was claimed that the Alpha Jet NGEA was the &quot;only existing aircraft in its category featuring a completely integrated digital navigation and attack system&quot;. While no new-build aircraft were produced of this variant, existing Egyptian Alpha Jets were reportedly upgraded to a similar standard. A single prototype was flown, presumably a modification of one of the original Alpha Jet prototypes. In September 1982, this aircraft made its first public appearance at the Farnborough Airshow.
Another proposed variant was the &quot;Alpha Jet 3 Advanced Training System&quot;, at one point given the title of &quot;Lancier&quot;. This proposal was intended to perform all-weather ground attack operations, as well as to perform anti-shipping and anti-helicopter missions. Featured many of the same systems as the &quot;Alpha Jet 2&quot;, it was to be equipped with twin cockpit multifunction displays (MFDs) and potential carriage of AGAVE or Anemone radar, a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) imager, a laser targeting system and a modern countermeasures suite. A prototype was flown, again presumably an upgrade of an original Alpha Jet prototype.

In June 1985, Dornier announced that it was studying its own third generation Alpha Jet upgrade program, independent of Dassault. This proposed upgrade involved substantial avionics upgrades and man-machine interface alterations, such as the addition of multiple head-up displays (HUDs) to allow instructors to view what students are viewing, with the aim of being more suited for the sophisticated requirements of modern and impending fighter aircraft. Dornier judged the Alpha Jet&#x27;s airframe to have been suitable without modification for future market needs.

In September 1988, Dassault revealed that it had proposed a navalised variant of the Alpha Jet, as a carrier-based trainer to the French Naval Aviation to replace their Fouga CM.175 Zéphyr and Dassault Étendard IV fleets. Designated &quot;Alpha Jet Maritime 3&quot;, it was promoted as having been fully navalised and fitted with the avionics intended for the &quot;Alpha Jet 3 Advanced Training System&quot; to give it compatibility with the upcoming next generation of carrier fighter aircraft. Carrier adaptions included the addition of an arrestor hook and a strengthened landing gear and undercarriage.

==Design==

The Alpha Jet is a light twin-engine aircraft equipped with an intentionally simple airframe despite the performance delivered. Both the leading edges and air intakes are fixed; while the aerodynamic shape of the aircraft, which was developed with the aid of computer aided design (CAD), conforms with the area rule. Fully powered controls are used, comprising a dual-hydraulic systems and load-factor limited dynamic feel system arrangement attached to conventional flight control surfaces. The cockpit is pressurised for greater comfort during training. The Alpha Jet is designed to accommodate ten-minute turn around times with minimal ground equipment, using features such as pressurised single-point refueling, ladder-less entry/exit of the cockpit, and a ten-hour endurance of the liquid oxygen system.

The Alpha Jet was designed to perform a diverse range of roles. The principal users of the type, Germany and France, operated their Alpha Jets in different capacities, the German as a ground attack platform and the French as a trainer aircraft. Beyond performing different roles, the Alpha Jet fleets of France and Germany noticeably differed in their specification and equipment. German aircraft were fitted with a more extensive weapon-aiming system, a different fuel system, a yaw damper, different brakes, nosewheel steering, an arrester hook, and Stencel ejector seats in place of Martin-Baker. The majority of the specialised equipment used on the ground attack-orientated variant of the Alpha Jet was provided by German firms. In addition to the ground attack role, the Luftwaffe employed the Alpha Jet in the electronic countermeasures (ECM) and aerial reconnaissance roles; for the latter purpose, a reconnaissance pod could be fitted upon the port hardpoint.

The Alpha Jet is powered by a pair of SNECMA Turbomeca Larzac turbofan engines. It is a low bypass-ratio, twin-spool engine that uses modular construction methods. The Larzac was a new engine at the time, having only performed its first run a year prior to being selected to power the Alpha Jet. The need for greater thrust to power the aircraft than the original model of the engine could generate led to the development and adoption of the 2,970 lb &quot;Larzac 04&quot; in February 1972. This version of the engine initially powered the Alpha Jet. 

West Germany was interested in powering the type with the General Electric J85, but France objected to the use of an American engine which would result in US export restrictions upon the overall aircraft and agreed to assume the cost of developing the French-built Larzac. During the 1980s, an upgraded model of the Larzac engine which increased the thrust by 10 per cent was developed.

The avionics of the original version of the Alpha Jet were of an austere nature, partly to make it a simple and easily exportable aircraft. The basic type lacked features such as an autopilot, inertial navigation, or a radar. Later upgrade programs typically focused on the addition of a glass cockpit and other avionics systems. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s Alpha Jets were equipped with additional avionics for the attack role, such as a Doppler radar and additional hardpoints. During the 1970s, Dornier claimed that the Alpha Jet outperformed aircraft used as the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, LTV A-7 Corsair II, and Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in the close air support role. The firms stated that the Alpha Jet was smaller, faster, less vulnerable, more maneuverable, cheaper and had higher all-round performance than the A-10.

The Alpha Jet was more complex than competing second generation trainer aircraft, requiring seven man hours of maintenance for every flight hour. Nearly 5,000lb of munitions and equipment can be carried on five hardpoints, four on the wings and one at the centerline on the lower fuselage. In an armed configuration, a gun pod containing a 30 mm DEFA cannon, as installed on French aircraft, or 27 mm Mauser BK-27 cannon, as installed on German aircraft, would typically be installed upon the centerline hard point.

==Operational history==
===France===

The French Air Force decided to use the Alpha Jet primarily as a trainer. On 4 November 1977, the first production Alpha Jet intended for French service conducted its first flight. The French variant was known as the &quot;Alpha Jet E&quot; (the &quot;E&quot; standing for &quot;École&quot;, French for &quot;School&quot;) or &quot;Alpha Jet Advanced Trainer/Light Attack&quot; aircraft. The initial deliveries to France for service trials took place in 1978, lead to the type being introduced to line service in May 1979. The Alpha Jet E quickly replaced the Canadair T-33 and Fouga Magister in jet trainer role, as well as the Dassault Mystère IVA in its weapons training capacity.
The &quot;Patrouille de France&quot;, air demonstration team of the French Air Force, fly the Alpha Jet. A total of 176 production Alpha Jet E machines were delivered up to 1985, not the 200 that had been planned. While an excellent aircraft, French air force commanders of combat units had one complaint against the Alpha Jet, that it was a very forgiving aircraft to fly, resulting in a lengthier and steeper learning curve when assigned to fly combat aircraft which were not so forgiving.

During the early 1990s, the French Air Force investigated the &quot;Alpha Jet 3&quot; program, which involved installing a fully digital cockpit, modernised communications suite, and a full navigation/attack and sensor training system. It was ultimately abandoned as being too expensive. In 1998, France&#x27;s defence ministry examined prospective upgrades focused on the Alpha Jet&#x27;s cockpit, such as the installation of a new Head-Up Display (HUD) and multifunction displays. 

In June 2003, Dassault revealed its plans for an Alpha Jet upgrade to potentially meet the French Air Force&#x27;s long term training requirements. This upgrade was similar to that which was performed for the Belgian Air Force&#x27;s Alpha Jet fleet, involving the installation of a glass cockpit, increasing cockpit compatibility with frontline aircraft such as the Dassault Rafale and Dassault Mirage 2000, as well as a structural overhaul.

In September 2014, Direction générale de l&#x27;armement (DGA) and French Air Force officials were reportedly investigating the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master as a replacement for the Alpha Jet. Alenia Aermacchi claimed that France was interested in procuring 35 M-346s in this capacity. In April 2015, the DGA issued an initial pre-solicitation request for a replacement trainer aircraft. Likely candidates for this requirement reportedly include the M-346 Master, Aero L-39 Albatros, Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and Pilatus PC-21. The PC-21 was introduced in 2018.

===West Germany / Germany===

The Luftwaffe decided to use the Alpha Jet mainly in the light strike role, preferring to continue flight training in the southwestern United States on American trainer types instead of performing training in Germany, although Germany also used Alpha Jets based at Beja, Portugal for weapons training. On 12 April 1978, the first production German Alpha Jet performed its maiden flight, deliveries commenced in March 1979. It was designated the &quot;Alpha Jet A&quot; (the &quot;A&quot; standing for &quot;Appui Tactique&quot; or &quot;Tactical Support&quot;) or &quot;Alpha Jet Close Support&quot; variant. The Luftwaffe obtained a total of 175 aircraft up to 1983, the type was used to replace the Fiat G91R/3 fleet.

In 1985, West Germany began a comprehensive upgrade program, known as the &quot;Improved Combat Efficiency&quot; (ICE) program, for their Alpha Jet fleet; these upgrades were to involve the installation of a Mil Spec 1553B databus, new sensors integrated with the navigation/attack systems, modernized electronic countermeasures suite, measures to minimize the aircraft&#x27;s radar and infrared signatures, protection measures around the fuel system, and new armaments such as the AGM-65 Maverick. In 1988, it was announced that the ICE program has been cancelled. A more austere upgrade program did proceed in its place, which integrated the AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile and navigation computer upgrades, along with several minor airframe and equipment refinements, such as the addition of a jettisonable gun pod.

During the 1991 Gulf War, 18 German Alpha Jets were deployed to Turkey alongside 6 Italian F-104s and Belgian Mirage 5s under a NATO-based operation to protect Turkey against potential Iraqi attacks.

In 1992, the Luftwaffe began to phase out their Alpha Jet A aircraft, reserving 45 for lead-in fighter training. In 1993, a total of 50 were passed on to Portugal to replace the Northrop T-38 Talon and Fiat G.91 fleets, with five of these used for spares. The rest of the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Alpha Jets were gradually phased out, the last leaving service in 1998, and customers were sought to buy them. In October 1995, the German military offered 42 Alpha Jets to Poland for 143 million PLN. In 1999, 25 Alpha Jets were sold to Thailand at 1 million baht ($27,000) each, replacing the North American OV-10 Bronco in the border patrol role; while the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency obtained 12 as chase aircraft and flight test platforms due to a shortage in available BAE Systems Hawk aircraft for the role.

Germany was keen to sell the retired Alpha Jets quickly since they were reported as costing around DM100,000 ($55,000) to keep in storage each month. Fairchild-Dornier received a US$43 million contract to refurbish a number of the aircraft and provide support to the end users. Apparently 32 more, including two spares hulks, were sold to the United Arab Emirates, though details are unclear. Several were also sold to private owners, such as those used by the Austrian-based &quot;Flying Bulls&quot; flight demonstration team, which flies a range of classic aircraft.

===Nigeria===

In 1990, four Alpha Jets of the Nigerian Air Force were deployed in support of Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) forces stationed in Liberia, which were engaged in combat with the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) following an international intervention in the Liberian Civil War. In a series of strikes, these aircraft targeted and launched successful attacks upon Charles Taylor&#x27;s HQ, rebel convoys and shipping, and gun emplacements at Roberts International Airport; the results of their intervention was judged by &quot;The New York Times&quot; to have given ECOMOG forces a decisive advantage in fire power.

In 1992, six Nigerian Alpha Jets were placed directly under ECOMOG command, and employed against the NPLF in an extensive campaign of air strikes, road interdictions missions, anti-shipping sorties, and night raids (a task which the Alpha Jet was not normally equipped to perform). They were even employed to deny access to key bridges in order to give ECOMOG ground forces time to capture them before they were sabotaged. In total, Alpha Jets flew approximately 3,000 combat missions in support of ECOMOG, sustaining no losses but incurring some damage from anti-aircraft artillery.

In 2013, Nigeria began taking steps to bring its Alpha Jet fleet back into service, upgrading 13 of the original 24 into serviceable condition, due to an urgent need for strike aircraft to participate in air support missions for counterinsurgency operations against Boko Haram. In March 2016, Nigerian car manufacturer Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) signed a supply agreement with the Nigerian Air Force to produce components and various spare parts for the Alpha Jet. In 2015, Nigeria ordered four additional aircraft from the United States; these aircraft had been de-militarized and prepared for civilian operations, however Nigeria had reportedly returned two of these to an unspecified armed configuration by early 2016.

The restored Alpha Jet force has been routinely employed in combat air patrols, and has conducted multiple air strikes against Boko Haram militants over a number of years. In September 2014, multiple Alpha Jets conducted a large number of aerial bombardment missions over and around the area of Bama, Borno State, during the fight to regain the city following the withdrawal of friendly ground forces. In early October 2014, Boko Haram released a video containing the decapitation of who they claimed was a captured Nigerian Air Force pilot of a downed Alpha Jet. In March 2016, attacks performed by Nigerian Alpha Jets had reportedly dislodged Boko Haram fighters from Sambisa Forest, Borno State.

On 31 March 2021, a Nigerian Air Force Alpha jet (NAF475) went missing near Borno State in northeastern Nigeria while carrying out air support for Nigerian troops fighting against Boko Haram, both pilots were missing, presumed dead. A video was released claiming to show the jet being shot down, however the video was evidently doctored including previous clips from Syria. The Nigerian Air Force attributed the crash to an accident, pending further investigation. However the video showed Boko Haram fighters at the crash site and remains of the pilots.

On 18 July 2021, in a rare occurrence of a military jet downed by a criminal organization, an Alpha jet was shot down after conducting an interdiction mission on the border of the states of Zamfara and Kaduna against criminal gangs. The military blamed intense fire from armed gangs for the shoot down. The pilot ejected and returned to an Army base, after evading capture.

===Belgium===

On 13 September 1973, the Belgian defence minister announced that 33 Alpha Jets had been ordered in two batches of 16 and 17 aircraft. These aircraft were given the designation &quot;Alpha Jet 1B&quot;, the assembly work being performed by Belgian aircraft manufacturer SABCA. Deliveries took place between 1978 and 1980. By April 1981, the Belgian Air Force had reportedly accumulated 10,000 flight hours on their 33 Alpha Jets during training operations. The introduction of the Alpha Jet led to the retirement of Belgium&#x27;s Fouga CM.170 Magister fleet; changes to the training syllabus included the adoption of a new discipline, &quot;combined flight&quot;, as well as a greater use of flight simulators.

During the late 1990s and 2000s, SABCA performed a number of upgrades on the Belgian aircraft to the &quot;Alpha Jet 1B+&quot; configuration; improvements made included the addition of a laser-gyro inertial navigation system, a GPS receiver, a HUD in the front cockpit and a HUD repeater in the rear, a video recorder and other more minor improvements. In 2000, the initial Alpha Jet 1B+ was re-delivered to the Belgian Air Force.

The Alpha Jet was phased out in 2019. The next year 25 airframes and several spare parts were sold to the Canadian company Top Aces which provides adversary air combat training.Top Aces acquires 25 Belgian Air Force Alpha Jets

===Egypt===
On 17 September 1978, Dassault and the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) signed a license manufacturing agreement for the Alpha Jet; at the time, it was projected that up to 160 Alpha Jets would be domestically produced in Helwan, Egypt. Shortly thereafter, Egypt placed an initial order for 30 aircraft, designated &quot;Alpha Jet MS1&quot;, which were to a standard trainer configuration. Four complete aircraft were directly supplied from Dassault&#x27;s facility in France, while the remaining 26 of the order were domestically assembled in Egypt using knockdown kits by AOI.

During the early 1980s, an additional 15 aircraft, designated &quot;Alpha Jet MS2&quot;, were ordered. The Alpha Jet MS2 bore high levels of similarity to Dassault&#x27;s proposed &quot;Alpha Jet NGEA&quot;, featuring a Sagem-built Uliss 81 nav/attack system, a Thomson-CSF-built laser rangefinder and HUD, along with a digital multiplex databus. The Egyptian Air Force Alpha Jets were based at As Salahiya airbase in 308 (Close Air Support) Tactical Wing with 57 Squadron and 58 Squadron. In 2015 the 308 CAS Tactical Wing moved with both squadrons to El Mansoura airbase for ground attack training. The Egyptian Air Force used the Alpha Jet MS1 fleet to replace the Aero L-29 Delfín and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 in the trainer role, while the later-built MS2 standard aircraft served to replace the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 in the ground-attack role. In February 2000, Egypt was reportedly seeking to replace their Alpha Jet fleet, and was investigating several options, including the BAE Systems Hawk.

===Civilian service===

Swiss firm RUAG Aviation offers full support services for the Alpha Jet in cooperation with Dassault Aviation; services provided includes recommissioning, servicing, inspections, system upgrades integration work, along with technical and logistic support. Abbatare Inc. of Arlington, Washington, under the name of &quot;Alpha Jets USA&quot;, has imported a number of Alpha Jets into the United States, the firm modifies and sells individual aircraft in the civilian market.

Canadian aviation specialist Top Aces operates a fleet of Douglas A-4 Skyhawks and Alpha Jets as adversary aircraft in air combat training exercises; these are often operated under contract for various military clients. Multiple civil aerial display teams have procured Alpha Jets, such as the &quot;Flying Bulls&quot; and &quot;Mustang High Flight Aerobatics&quot; teams. H211, a private company which manages the planes owned and leased by Google execs Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt, operates a single Alpha Jet, based at NASA&#x27;s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. It is reportedly equipped with scientific instrumentation and used for research purposes.

Commencing in the third quarter of 2017, Air Affairs Australia and Discovery Air will provide three Alpha Jets to the Australian Defence Force for Australian Army attack controller training and anti-surface training (simulating sea-skimming missiles) for the Royal Australian Navy. They will be based at RAAF Base Williamtown.

===Others===
Considerable foreign sales were expected for the Alpha Jet, with the type becoming available before its main rival, the United Kingdom&#x27;s BAE Systems Hawk. The two types, being relatively similar in role and specifications, ended up competing for many of the same contracts. This competition led to an aviation commentator stating of the two aircraft:
Several other nations also obtained the Alpha Jet E, including the Ivory Coast (seven aircraft), Morocco (24), Nigeria (24), Qatar (six) and Togo (five). All of these machines were from French production except for the 24 Nigerian aircraft, which were from German production.

Between 1979 and 1981, the Royal Moroccan Air Force received 24 Alpha Jets which were organized into a training squadron and a COIN squadron both based in Meknes. Alpha Jets were employed in strike missions against the Polisario Front during the Western Sahara War, one of their number being shot down in December, 1985.

<text>The Deutsche Reichsbahn (), also known as the German National Railway, the German State Railway, German Reich Railway, and the German Imperial Railway, was the German national railway system created after the end of World War I from the regional railways of the individual states of the German Empire. The &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; has been described as &quot;the largest enterprise in the capitalist world in the years between 1920 and 1932&quot;; nevertheless, its importance &quot;arises primarily from the fact that the Reichsbahn was at the center of events in a period of great turmoil in German history&quot;.

== Overview ==
The company was founded on 1 April 1920 as the (&quot;German Imperial Railways&quot;) when the Weimar Republic, which still used the nation-state term of the previous monarchy, (German Reich, hence the usage of the in the name of the railway; the monarchical term was ), took national control of the German railways, which had previously been run by the German states (&quot;Länderbahnen&quot;). In 1924 it was reorganised under the aegis of the (&quot;German Imperial Railway Company&quot;, DRG), a nominally private railway company, which was 100% owned by the German state. In 1937 the railway was reorganised again as a state authority and given the name (&quot;German Imperial Railway&quot;, DRB). After the in 1938 the DR also took over the (&quot;Federal Railway of Austria&quot;, BBÖ).

The East and West German states were founded in 1949. East Germany took over the control of the DR on its territory and continued to use the traditional name , while the railway in West Germany became the (&quot;German Federal Railway&quot;, DB). The Austrian (&quot;Austrian Federal Railways&quot;, ÖBB) was founded in 1945, and was given its present name in 1947.

In January 1994, following German reunification, the East German merged with the West German to form Germany&#x27;s new national carrier, (&quot;German Rail&quot;, DBAG), technically no longer a government agency but still a 100% state-owned joint stock company.

== Deutsche Reichseisenbahnen (1920–1924) ==
The first railways to be owned by the German Empire, which was founded in 1871, were the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine, whose Imperial General Division of Railways in Alsace-Lorraine () had its headquarters in Straßburg (now Strasbourg). It was formed after France had ceded the territory of Alsace-Lorraine in 1871 to the German Empire and the newly created Third French Republic had formally purchased the French Eastern Railway Company ( or ) and then sold it again to the German Empire. After the end of the First World War this national &quot;imperial railway&quot; was taken back by France.

In the remaining German states, by contrast, the existing state railways continued to be subject to their respective sovereigns, despite the fact that Otto von Bismarck had tried in vain to purchase the main railway lines for the Empire. A similar attempt failed in 1875 as a result of opposition from the middle powers when Albert von Maybach presented a draft Reich Railway Act to the Bundesrat.

In the wake of the stipulations of the Weimar Constitution of 11 August 1919, the state treaty on the foundation of the (&quot;German Reich Railways&quot;) came into force on 1 April 1920. This resulted in the merger of the existing state railways () of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Württemberg, Baden, Mecklenburg and Oldenburg under the newly formed German Reich. The state railways that merged were the:

* Baden state railways
* Mecklenburg state railways
* Oldenburg state railways
* Bavarian state railways
* Saxon state railways
* Württemberg state railways
* Prussian-Hessian state railways

Initially called the or , the company was formally given the name &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; by decree of the Reich Minister of Transport, Wilhelm Groener, on 27 June 1921. In 1922 the old railway divisions () were renamed as Reich railway divisions ().

== Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (1924–1937) ==

Among the provisions of the 1924 Dawes Plan was a plan to utilize the state railway completely for the payment of war reparations. Following the plan&#x27;s publication, on 12 February 1924, the Reich government announced the creation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn as a state enterprise under the Reich Ministry of Transport ().

As this was not enough to satisfy the reparations creditors, on 30 August 1924 a law was enacted providing for the establishment of a state-owned (&quot;German Imperial Railway Company&quot;, DRG) as a public holding company to operate the national railways. The aim was to earn profits which, under the Dawes Plan, were to be used to contribute to Germany&#x27;s war reparations.

At the same time as the Reichsbahn law was enacted, the company was handed a bill of eleven billion Goldmarks to be paid to the Allied powers, while its original capital was valued at fifteen billion Goldmarks. These terms were later amended in the Young Plan. Nevertheless, the Great Depression and the regular payment of war reparations (about 660 million Reichsmarks annually) put a considerable strain on the Reichsbahn. Not until the Lausanne Conference of 1932 was the Reichsbahn released from its financial obligations. In total, about 3.87 billion Goldmarks was paid in reparations to the Allied powers.

During the DRG period the following milestones occurred:

* 1 October 1930: the DRG took over the Bremen Port Railway ()
* 27 June 1933: the DRG&#x27;s sister company the was founded
* 1 March 1935: the railways of the Saar were incorporated

The beginning of the DRG was characterised by the acquisition of new rolling stock built to standard types, such as the standard steam locomotives (). The stock already in use had been inherited from the various state railways and comprised a great number of designs, many of them quite old. In fact, the DRG was unable to procure new stock in the numbers it wanted to both for financial reasons and due to delays in upgrading the lines to carry higher axle loads. The locomotive classes taken over from the old state railways, especially those from the Prussia, continued to dominate the scene until the end of the 1930s. They included, for example, the Prussian P 8 (BR 38.10-40), Prussian P 10 (BR 39), Prussian G 12 (BR 58.10) and the Prussian T 20 (BR 95). The Bavarian S 3/6 (BR 18.5) express locomotive even continued in production until 1930.

Not until the procurement programme for the wartime were new goods locomotives built in large numbers, but of course now for a very different purpose.

Taking lead from the German Labor Front, the Deutsche Reichsbahn took part in the conflict of intermarriage in Germany. In August 1933 Robert Ley, leader of Reich Labor, demanded that those administrators working for the German Labor Front be married only to German individuals. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took the lead in discriminating against intermarried workers, firing German employees married to Jews and forbidding intermarried Germans from working there in the future, starting in November 1933.

In 1935 the railway network had a total of of line, of which was main line railway, were branch lines and were light railways.

In the latter part of the 1930s, the development of high-speed trains like the &quot;Flying Hamburger&quot; was accelerated. Before that streamlined steam engines had been built, but they were not as economical as the high-speed diesel and electric railcars. Although the Borsig streamlined steam engine, the no. 05 002 reached a speed of during a demonstration run, the Reichsbahn preferred fast railcars on its high speed network. The potential of these express trains was demonstrated by the in its record run on 21 June 1931 when it reached a top speed of .

Before the Second World War the most important railway lines ran in an east–west direction. The high-speed lines at that time were on the Prussian Eastern Railway which ran through the Polish corridor (albeit slower there due to the poor state of the tracks), the lines from Berlin to Hamburg, via Hanover to the Ruhrgebiet, via Frankfurt am Main to southwest Germany, on which the diesel express trains ran, and the Silesian Railway from Berlin to Breslau (now Wrocław).

=== Bavarian Group Administration ===
Within the state of Bavaria, the Bavarian Group Administration () had its head office () and was largely independent by § III 14 of the DRG&#x27;s company regulations. It was responsible for the electrification of many lines, following the commencement of electric power generation to the railways at the Walchensee Power Plant, and for the independent trialling and procurement of locomotives and passenger coaches. The Group Administration introduced, for example, the Class E 32 locomotive and Class ET 85 railcar into service.

Bavaria also continued to use its own signalling system for many years after the merger.

In 1933 the Group Administration was disbanded and administration of the railways in Bavaria was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn.

=== Leadership of the Reichsbahn ===
At the head of the Reichsbahn was a director general (). The office holders were:

* 1924–1926 Rudolf Oeser
* 1926–1945 Julius Dorpmüller

From 1925, the director general had a permanent deputy. These were:
* 1925–1926 Julius Dorpmüller
* 1926–1933 Wilhelm Weirauch
* 1933–1942 Wilhelm Kleinmann
* 1942–1945 Albert Ganzenmüller

As a result of the Reichsbahn Act of 11 July 1939, the Reich Transport Minister became the director general of the Reichsbahn by his office. Dorpmüller, who since 1937 was also in charge of the Reich Ministry of Transport, continued in office as the director general after 1939 under this new legal framework.

== Deutsche Reichsbahn (1937–1945) ==
With the Act for the New Regulation of the Conditions of the Reichsbank and the Deutsche Reichsbahn () of 10 February 1937 the was placed under Reich sovereignty and was given the name .

=== World War II and military use ===
The had an important logistic role in supporting the rapid movement of the troops of the Wehrmacht, for example:
* March 1938: the annexation of Austria (Anschluss) and
* October 1938: the annexation of the Sudetenland after the Munich Agreement
* March 1939: the German occupation of Czechoslovakia
* September/October 1939: the invasion of Poland
* April 1940: Operation Weserübung (the invasions of Denmark and Norway)
* May/June 1940: the Battle of France
* 1941: Operation Barbarossa and the Balkan Campaign.

In all the occupied lands the Reichsbahn endeavoured to incorporate the captured railways (rolling stock and infrastructure) into their system. Even towards the end of the war the Reichsbahn continued to move military formations. For example, in the last great offensive, the Battle of the Bulge (from 16 December 1944), tank formations were transported from Hungary to the Ardennes.

The railways managed by the &quot;Eastern Railway Division&quot; () were initially run from that part of the Polish State Railways within the so-called General Government-assigned part of the (PKP), but from November 1939 by the Ostbahn (Generalgouvernement).
In the campaigns against Poland, Denmark, France, Yugoslavia, Greece etc. the newly acquired standard gauge networks could be used without difficulty. By contrast, after the start of the invasion of Russia on 22 June 1941, the problem arose of transferring troops and materiel to Soviet broad gauge lines or converting them to German standard gauge. Confounding German plans, the Red Army and Soviet railways managed to withdraw or destroy the majority of its rolling stock during its retreat. As a result, German standard gauge rolling stock had to be used for an additional logistic role within Russia; this required the laying of standard gauge track. The price was high: Reichsbahn railway staff and the railway troops of the Wehrmacht had to convert a total of of Soviet trackage to German standard gauge track between 22 June and 8 October 1941.

During the war, locomotives in the war zones were sometimes given camouflage livery. In addition, locomotives were painted with the symbol (the eagle, Germany&#x27;s traditional symbol of national sovereignty) holding a swastika. On goods wagons the name &quot;&quot; was replaced by the letters &quot;DR&quot;. Postal coaches continued to bear the name &quot;&quot;.

The logistics of the were crucial to the conduct of Germany&#x27;s military offensives. The preparations for the invasion of Russia saw the greatest troop deployment by rail in history.

=== Expansion ===
Characteristic of the first six and a half years of this period was the exponential growth of the , which was almost exclusively due to the takeover of other national railways. This affected both parts of foreign state railways (in Austria the entire state railway) in the countries annexed by the Deutsche Reich, as well as private railways in Germany and in other countries:


=== Holocaust ===

The logistics of the Reichsbahn were also an important factor during the Holocaust. Jews were transported like cattle to the concentration and extermination camps by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in trains of covered goods wagons, now known as Holocaust trains. These movements using cattle wagons from the goods station of the great Frankfurt Market Hall, for example, thus played a significant role in the genocide within the extermination machinery of the Holocaust. In 1997, the market erected a memorial plaque in recognition of this dark period of history.

The following is an excerpt from the testimony of Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg:

Conditions in the wagons were inhumane because no water or food was provided, and sanitary arrangements were minimal, usually a bucket in a corner of the wagon. Although each wagon was intended to hold about 50 people, they were frequently overcrowded and holding 100 to 150 people. No heating was provided, so people could freeze in winter and overheat in summer. Deaths in the wagons were frequent among the young, old, sick, and disabled, especially as travel was slow and often lasted many days since the trains had low priority on the tracks. Their small amount of luggage was stored separately, sometimes at the station and never left with the train, but examined for valuables which were stolen or resold for profit.

Beginning in November 2007, a museum train, the &quot;Train of Commemoration&quot; (), began a tour of Germany as a rolling memorial to the thousands of youth and children who were deported from all over Europe, many via the , to the camps. A certain amount of controversy has surrounded the train&#x27;s tour through Germany, in part because of the apparent lack of cooperation on the part of AG (DB AG) concerning such matters as compensation for the use of the DB AG&#x27;s right of way (during the tour) and the stationing of the train, during its visit to Berlin, at the station instead of the more centrally located main railway station. The tour was scheduled to end on 8 May 2008 (the 63rd anniversary of the end of the European portion of World War II) when the train arrived at Auschwitz. However, it continued to make appearances through 2009, and as of January 2010 the website requests visitors to look for further travel plans at the end of February.

==Rebuilding after 1945==
German railways were heavily bombed by Allied RAF and USAAF bombers. Marshalling yards, bridges, repair shops, and service facilities were all destroyed. Fighter-bombers targeted locomotives and bombed them. As a result, trains were at a standstill in the spring of 1945. The cities of Hamburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and others were affected. Stations were completely destroyed and wagons and carriage set on fire and destroyed. Bomb craters and blast seriously damaged the permanent way or rail track. The Allied forces of Occupation were put in charge and instantly had myriad problems regarding food, lack of housing, fuel, displaced persons and people on the move. 

The Engineering Corps of British and American forces oversaw the partial rebuilding of the lines and cars with local labour from prisoners of war, rubble women, and de-mobilized soldiers. Temporary wooden bridges were put up over destroyed spans. Multiple tracks were disassembled into one smaller working line, equipment assessed and rebuilt. In three months, the railway was working again in a rudimentary form. The Armies of Occupation needed the railways to move coal and the soon to be gathered agricultural harvest. Deutschebahn had a critical shortage of wagons, carriages and locomotives, so much so that the US gave war surplus engines to ensure the movement of freight.

=== Breakup of the Reichsbahn ===
With the end of the Second World War in 1945 those parts of the Deutsche Reichsbahn that were outside the new German borders laid down in the Potsdam Agreement were transferred to the ownership and administration of the states in whose territory they were situated. For example, on 27 April 1945, the Austrian railways became independent again as the Austrian State Railway ( or ÖStB), later renamed as the Austrian Federal Railways ( or ÖBB) on 5 August 1947.

=== Railways in the occupation zones ===
Operational control of the rest of the DR was devolved to the respective zones of occupation so that the legally existed in four parts until 1949.

==== US Zone ====
In the American Zone the Reichsbahn divisions of Augsburg, Frankfurt am Main, Kassel, Munich, Regensburg and Stuttgart (for the railways in Württemberg-Baden) were subordinated to the Senior Control Office US Zone () in Frankfurt.

==== British Zone ====
The Reichsbahn divisions of Essen, Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne, Münster (Westfalen) and Wuppertal were grouped into the &quot; in the British Zone&quot; under Director General Max Leibbrand in Bielefeld.

==== French Zone ====
In the French Occupation Zone, the railways were grouped into the Operating Association of the Southwest German Railways () with its headquarters in Speyer. The Operating Association included the railway divisions of Karlsruhe (in the US Zone), Mainz and Saarbrücken. After the Saarland was transferred from the French Zone and was given its own state railway – the Railways of the Saarland () – the rest of the network of the Saarbrücken division went into the new Trier division. After the Deutsche Bundesbahn was formed this Operating Association was merged with it.

==== Soviet Zone ====
The Soviet zone of occupation became a self-declared socialist state, the German Democratic Republic (commonly known as East Germany), on 7 October 1949. One month prior, on 7 September 1949, the railway systems in the three western zones (the Federal Republic of Germany), were reunified and renamed the (DB – German Federal Railways).

On the formation of East Germany on 7 October 1949, the railway system in the Soviet Zone retained the name (DR), despite the connotations of the word &quot;Reich&quot;. This was due to the designation of the in postwar treaties and military protocols as the railway operator in West Berlin, a role it retained until the creation of the unified DBAG at the beginning of 1994.

==== Bizone and creation of the DB ====
To conform to the formation of the Bizone in 1946 the Head Office of the Railways of the American and British Occupation Regions () was created. In 1947 it moved its headquarters to Offenbach am Main and called itself the in the United Economic Region (). Following the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany, it was renamed Deutsche Bundesbahn.

=== East German Deutsche Reichsbahn ===

In the post-war years, the DR in East Germany continued to develop independently of the DB, but very much in parallel. The locomotive classification scheme, based on that of the DRG, was extended. The production, conversion and development of steam locomotives initially continued in earnest; older, especially ex- classes being rationalised and withdrawn from service. A major conversion () programme to update steam locomotives and rectify flawed, mainly wartime austerity, classes was carried out in the 1950s. Gradually, however, they were replaced by the more economical and easier-to-maintain diesel and electric classes. In general this happened rather later than in the West. In 1970, the DR renumbered its locomotives in order to conform to new computerised data standards.

On 3 October 1990, the GDR states acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany. Initially the two railway administrations continued to operate separately, albeit with increasing cooperation, and in 1994 they were merged to form the new Deutsche Bahn.

<doc id="1162603" wikidata="Q924037" url="?curid=1162603" title="Friday prayer">
<text>In Islam, Friday prayer, or Congregational prayer () is a community prayer service held once a week on Fridays. All Muslim men are expected to participate at a mosque with certain exceptions due to distance and situation. Women and children can also participate but do not fall under the same obligation that men do. The service consists of several parts including ritual washing, chants, recitation of scripture and prayer, and sermons.

&quot;Youm Jumu&#x27;ah&quot; (&quot;day of congregation&quot;), or simply &quot;Jumu&#x27;ah&quot; means Friday in Arabic. In many Muslim countries, the weekend is inclusive of Fridays, and in others, Fridays are half-days for schools and some workplaces. It is one of the most exalted Islamic rituals and one of its confirmed obligatory acts.

==Service==
The service consists of several parts including ritual washing, chants, recitation of scripture and prayer, and sermons.

===Ritual washing===

When entering the mosque, all worshippers practise wudu.

===Adhan and Iqama (call to prayer)===

A Muezzin will recite a specific chant called an Adhan to call the congregation to the mosque, then to line up to begin the service. The imam will then get up and recite The Sermon for Necessities. The first call summons Muslims to enter the mosque and then a second call, known as the &quot;iqama&quot;, summons those already in the mosque to line up for prayer.

===Khutbah sermon===

The imam will then get up and give a sermon called a Khutbah and recite prayer and verses from the Quran in Arabic. The sermon is given in the local language and Arabic or completely in Arabic depending on the context.

The imam performs the following:

# Stands and welcomes the congregation with a formal greeting in Arabic, then sits while the Adhan is recited.
# Stands up and recites The Sermon for Necessities.
# Recites verses from the Quran to invoke a sense of taqwa
# Recites a supplication called a dua.
# Starts the khutbah and then at a certain point stops and asks Allah for forgiveness.
# Sits down to leave space for the congregation to seek forgiveness from Allah.
# Stands, praises Allah and sends blessings upon Muhammed and then finishes the last part of the sermon.
# Recites additional dua and Salawat.
# Invites the congregation to line up for Jumu&#x27;ah prayer.

According to the majority of Shiite and Sunni doctrine, the sermon must contain praise and glorification of Allah, invoke blessings on Muhammad and his progeny, and have a short quotation from the Quran in Arabic called a surah. It must also give the participants a sense of taqwa, admonition and exhortation.

=== Jumu&#x27;ah prayer ===

Juum&#x27;ah prayer consists of two rak&#x27;ats or prayer segments. Shia and Sunni sects of Islam prescribe slight differences in this pattern but the following is a general outline of the steps of the prayer cycle.

# A raka&#x27;ah begins when the worshipper begins by saying the Takbir or Glorification of God and pronounces the words &quot;Allah is Greater&quot;, (Allah-Hu-Akbar).
# In the second part of the raka&#x27;ah, the worshipper makes another Takbir and bows to a 90-degree angle, placing their hands on their knees with their feet kept shoulder-width apart, with their eyes focused in between their feet or around the area and bowing in humble submission as if awaiting God&#x27;s command. During this position the words, &quot;Glory be to Allah the most Magnificent&quot; are uttered silently as a form of ritual praise.
# The third movement of the raka&#x27;ah is to return from bowing to the standing position before, while saying the Takbir, then descending into full prostration on the ground. In prostration, the worshipper&#x27;s forehead and nose is flatly placed on the floor with the palm of their hands placed shoulder-width apart to the right and left of their ears. During this position the words, &quot;Glory be to Allah the Almighty&quot; are repeated with contemplation as a form of ritual praise.
# The fourth movement is for the worshipper to return from prostration into a sitting position with their legs folded flatly under their body.
According to Shi&#x27;ite doctrine, two qunut (raising one&#x27;s hands for supplication during salat) is especially recommended during salatul Jum&#x27;ah. The first Qunut is offered in the 1st rak&#x27;at before ruku&#x27; and the second is offered in the 2nd rak&#x27;at after rising from ruku&#x27;. According to Shiite doctrine, it is advisable (Sunnat) to recite Surah al-Jum&#x27;ah in the first rak&#x27;at and Surah al-Munafiqun in the second rak&#x27;at, after Surah al-Hamd.

== Religious significance ==
=== Of the day Friday ===
Although Friday is not a sabbath in Islam it is recognized as a superior and holy day. According to the Islamic scholar Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya there are 32 reasons that Friday is special. Some of the reasons include a belief that Friday was the day when Adam was created, entered into, and expelled from Jannah. It is also the day of the week when the Day of Judgment will occur and the world will end. There is also a belief that Allah is more likely to forgive and bless on Fridays. It is also believed to be the day that Islam was revealed to be perfected.

=== Obligation ===
There is consensus among Muslims regarding the Friday prayer (&quot;salat al-jum&#x27;ah&quot;) being &quot;wajib&quot; – required – in accordance with the Quranic verse, as well as the many traditions narrated both by Shi&#x27;i and Sunni sources. According to the majority of Sunni schools and some Shiite jurists, Friday prayer is a religious obligation, but their differences were based on whether its obligation is conditional to the presence of the ruler or his deputy in it or if it is &quot;wajib&quot; unconditionally. The Hanafis and the Twelver Imamis believe that the presence of the ruler or his deputy is necessary; the Friday prayer is not obligatory if neither of them is present. The Imamis require the ruler to be just (&quot;&#x27;adil&quot;); otherwise his presence is equal to his absence. To the Hanafis, his presence is sufficient even if he is not just. The Shafi&#x27;is, Malikis and Hanbalis attach no significance to the presence of the ruler.

Moreover, it has been stated that Jum&#x27;ah is not obligatory for old men, children, women, slaves, travellers, the sick, blind and disabled, as well as those who are outside the limit of two &quot;farsakhs&quot;.

=== In Islamic texts ===

==== Quran ====
It is mentioned in the Quran:
==== Hadith ====
Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj an-Naysaburi relates that Muhammad used to read Surah 87 (Al-Ala) and Surah 88, (Al-Ghashiya), in Eid Prayers and also in Friday prayers. If one of the festivals fell on a Friday, Muhammad would have made sure to read these two Surahs in the prayers.

Muhammad is quoted as saying &quot;The best day the sun rises over is Friday; on it Allah created Adam. On it, he was made to enter paradise, on it he was expelled from it, and the Last Hour will take place on no other day than Friday.&quot; [Ahmad and at-Tirmithi].

Aws ibn Aws, narrated that Muhammad said: &quot;Whoever performs Ghusl on Friday and causes (his wife) to do ghusl, then goes early to the mosque and attends from the beginning of the Khutbah and draws near to the Imam and listens to him attentively, Allah will give him the full reward of fasting all the days of a year and observing night-vigil on each of its nights for every step that he took towards the mosque.&quot; [Ibn Khuzaymah, Ahmad].

There are many hadiths reported on the significance of Jum&#x27;ah. The Muhammad has been reported saying:
*&quot;The Jum&#x27;ah is the pilgrimage of the poor&quot;.
*&quot;Whoever misses three Jum&#x27;ah, being indifferent to them, Allah seals his heart&quot;.
*&quot;Any Muslim who dies during the day or night of Friday will be protected by Allah from the trial of the grave.&quot; [At-Tirmithi and Ahmad].
* Also, hadith related by Al-Bukhari, quoted the Prophet saying that: &quot;In the day of Friday, there exists an hour that if a worshipper asks from Allah, anything he wishes in this hour, Allah will grant it and does not reject it, as long as he or she did not wish for bad&quot;.
*&quot;Friday has 12 hours, one of which is hour where dua are granted for Muslim believers. This hour is thought to be in the afternoon, after asr prayer&quot;.

=== In Sunni Islam ===

The &quot;Jum&#x27;ah&quot; prayer is half the &quot;Zuhr&quot; (dhuhr) prayer, for convenience, preceded by a &quot;khutbah&quot; (a sermon as a technical replacement of the two reduced &quot;rakaʿāt&quot; of the ordinary &quot;Zuhr&quot; (dhuhr) prayer), and followed by a congregational prayer, led by the imām. In most cases the khaṭīb also serves as the imam. Attendance is strictly incumbent upon all adult males who are legal residents of the locality.

The muezzin &quot;(muʾadhdhin)&quot; makes the call to prayer, called the adhan, usually 15–20 minutes prior to the start of Jum&#x27;ah. When the khaṭīb takes his place on the minbar, a second adhan is made. The khaṭīb is supposed to deliver two sermons, stopping and sitting briefly between them. In practice, the first sermon is longer and contains most of the content. The second sermon is very brief and concludes with a dua, after which the muezzin calls the iqāmah. This signals the start of the main two rak&#x27;at prayer of Jum&#x27;ah.

=== In Shia Islam ===

In Shia Islam, Salat al-Jum&#x27;ah is Wajib Takhyiri (at the time of Occultation), which means that there is an option to offer Jum&#x27;ah prayers, if its necessary, conditions are fulfilled, or to offer Zuhr prayers. Hence, if Salat al-Jum&#x27;ah is offered then it is not necessary to offer Zuhr prayer. It is also recommended by Shiite Scholars to attend Jum&#x27;ah as it will become Wajib after the appearance of Imam al-Mahdi and Jesus Christ (Isa).

Shiite (Imamite) attach high significance to the presence of a just ruler or his representative or Faqih and in the absence of a just ruler or his representative and a just faqih, there exists an option between performing either the Friday or the zuhr prayer, although preference lies with the performance of Friday prayer.

== History of the practice ==
According to the history of Islam and the report from Abdullah bn &#x27;Abbas narrated from the Prophet saying that: the permission to perform the Friday prayer was given by Allah before hijrah, but the people were unable to congregate and perform it. The Prophet wrote a note to Mus&#x27;ab ibn Umayr, who represented the Prophet in Madinah to pray two raka&#x27;at in congregation on Friday (that is, Jumu&#x27;ah). Then, after the migration of the Prophet to Medina, the &quot;Jumu&#x27;ah&quot; was held by him.

For Shiites, historically, their clergy discouraged Shiites from attending Friday prayers. According to them, communal Friday prayers with a sermon were wrong and had lapsed (along with several other religious practices) until the return of their 12th Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi. However, among others, Shiite modernist Muhammad ibn Muhammad Mahdi al-Khalisi (1890–1963) demanded that Shiites should more carefully observe Friday prayers in a step to bridge the gap with Sunnis. Later, the practice of communal Friday prayers was developed, and became standard there-afterwards, by Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran and later by Mohammad Mohammad Sadeq al-Sadr in Iraq. They justified the practice under the newly promoted &quot;Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists&quot; doctrine. When al-Sadr installed Friday prayer imams in Shia-majority areas—a practice not traditional in Iraqi Shiism and considered &quot;revolutionary, if not heretical&quot;—it put him at odds with the Shia religious establishment in Najaf. Under both Khomeini and al-Sadr, political sermons would be heard.

==Attendance rates==
The world&#x27;s largest Muslim population can be found in Indonesia, where over 240 million Muslims live making up nearly 90% of Indonesia&#x27;s total population. In the country, according to the World Values Survey conducted in the country in 2018, 62.0% of Indonesians attend religious services at least once a week (including 54.0% of the population under the age of 30 and 66.1% of men). Most of these presumably would fall under the category of attending jumuah prayers. These numbers are stable from the same survey conducted in 2006, where 64.5% of Indonesians attended religious services at least once a week (including 56.0% of the population under 30 and 64.3% of men).
The number of regular attendees is somewhat lower in the next largest Muslim-majority country, Pakistan, which has over 210 million Muslims making up over 95% of the population. The 2018 World Values Survey conducted there found that 46.1% of Pakistanis attended religious services at least once a week (including 47.0% of Pakistanis under the age of 30 and 52.7% of men). However, this was a large increase from the same survey conducted in 2012, where it was reported that only 28.9% of Pakistanis attended religious services at least once a week (including 21.5% of Pakistanis under the age of 30 and 31.4% of men). This is a testament to increasing religiosity in Pakistan, especially among the youth, who have gone from attending jumuah at rates far below that of the total population to attending at rates higher than the total population.

A different pattern is seen in the Muslim-majority country of Bangladesh (which has over 150 million Muslims making up over 90% of the population). There the 2002 World Values Survey found that 56.1% of Bangladeshis attended religious services at least once a week (including 50.6% of Bangladeshis below the age of 30 and 61.7% of men), whereas sixteen years later in 2018, the survey found that the number had dropped to 44.4% (including 41.3% of those under 30 and 48.8% of men).

Meanwhile, in the Arab country of Egypt, jumuah attendance has risen massively in recent years. The 2012 World Values Survey found that 45.2% of Egyptians attended at least once a week (including 44.9% of Egyptians under the age of 30 and 60.1% of Egyptian men), but six years later the 2018 World Values Survey found that the number of Egyptians attended at least once a week had risen to 57.0% (including 52.9% of those under 30 and 89.4% of men).

However, different patterns are found in the non-Arab Middle Eastern countries of Iran and Turkey. In these two countries, jumuah attendance is among the lowest in the world. The 2005 World Values Survey in Iran found 33.8% of the population attending (including 27.3% of Iranians under 30 and 38.9% of Iranian men). By 2020, all these numbers had fallen, as only 26.1% of the population attended at least once a week (including 19.1% of Iranians under 30 and 29.3% of men). In Turkey, the 2012 World Values Survey found 33.2% of the population attending (including 28.6% of Turks under 30 and 54.0% of men). Similarly, According to a 2012 survey by Pew Research Center, 19% of Turkish Muslims say that they attend Friday prayer once a week and 23% say they never visit their local mosque. However, six years later in 2018, the World Values Survey reported that 33.8% of Turks attended (including 29.0% of those under 30 and 56.4% of men). This shows that even though both countries have relatively low religious attendance, religiosity is stronger in Turkey than in Iran, especially among the youth.

In several countries, such as in Central Asia and Balkans, self-reported Muslims practice the religion at low levels. According to a 2012 survey by Pew Research Center, about 1% of the Muslims in Azerbaijan, 5% in Albania, 9% in Uzbekistan, 10% in Kazakhstan, 19% in Russia and 22% in Kosovo said that they attend mosque once a week or more. This was largely due to the religious restriction of Islam under communist rule, and attendance levels have been rising rapidly since the fall of the Soviet Union.

Mosque attendance rates in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have seen precipitous increases over the last decade. According to the World Values Survey, weekly attendance in Kazakhstan went from 9.0% in 2011 (including 8.7% among those under 30 and 9.6% among men) to 15.3% in 2018 (including 14.6% of those under 30 and 17.1% among men), while weekly attendance in Tajikistan climbed from 29.3% in 2011 (including 35.1% of those under 30 and 58.1% of men) to 33.2% in 2020 (including 35.1% of those under 30 and 58.1% of men). Generational replacement is in effect here as a more religious youthful contingent replaced a less religious contingent that grew up under the Soviet Union.

In the Middle East and North Africa, mosque attendance at least once a week ranges from 35% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan. Sub-Saharan African Muslim communities tend to have a high rates of mosque attendance, and ranges from 65% in Senegal to nearly 100% in Ghana. In South Asia, home to the largest Muslim communities in the world, mosque attendance at least once a week ranges from 53% in Bangladesh to 61% in Afghanistan.

Surveys conducted in 1994 and in 1996 observed a decrease in religiosity among Muslims in Belgium based on lowering mosque participation, less frequent prayer, dropping importance attached to a religious education, etc. This decrease in religiosity was more visible in younger Muslims. A study published in 2006, found that 35% of the Muslim youth in Germany attend religious services regularly. In 2009, 24% of Muslims in the Netherlands said they attended mosque once a week according to a survey. According to a survey published in 2010, 20% of the French Muslims claimed to go regularly to the mosque for the Friday service. Data from 2017 shows that American Muslim women and American Muslim men attend the mosque at similar rates (45% for men and 35% for women).

==Conditions==
A valid Jum&#x27;ah is said to fulfill certain conditions:
* Friday prayer must be prayed in congregation.
* There are at least two persons present. This is based on the Hadith of Tariq Ibn Shihab who reported that Muhammad said, &quot;Al-Jumuah is an obligation (wajib) upon every Muslim in the community.&quot; (An-Nasai). Scholars differ on how many people are required for performing Jumuah Prayer. The view believed to be the most correct is that Jumuah Prayer is valid if there are at least two people present. This is based on the hadith in which the Prophet is reported to have said, &quot;Two or more constitute a congregation.&quot; (Ibn Majah). Imam Ash-Shawkani states, &quot;The other prayers are considered to be made in congregation if there are two people present. The same applies to Friday prayer, unless there is a reason for it to be different. There is no evidence to show that [for the purpose of the congregation] its number should be larger than that for the other prayers.&quot;
* According to a Shiite law, only one Friday prayer may be prayed in a radius of 5.5 km. If two prayers are held within this distance, the latter is made null and void.
* There must be two sermons delivered by the imam before the prayer and attentively listened to by at least four (or six) persons.

==Format==
===Khutbah Jum&#x27;ah===
*A talk or sermon delivered in mosques before the Friday prayer. The sermon consists of two distinct parts, between which the Khatib (speaker) must sit down for a short time of rest.
*There should not be an undue interval or irrelevant action intervening between the sermon and the prayer. &quot; It should preferably be in Arabic, especially the Qur&#x27;anic passage which has to be recited in the sermon. Otherwise, it should be given in the language understood by the majority of the faithful who are there. In this case, the preacher should first recite in Arabic Qurʾānic verses praising God and Muhammad. &quot;
*According to the majority of Shiite and Sunni doctrine, the contents must contain the following: &quot;
# The praise and glorification of Allah
# Invocation of blessings on Muhammad and his progeny
# Enjoining the participants piety, admonition and exhortations
# A short surah from the Quran
* In addition to the above issues, the following are advised to be addressed in the second sermon:
# Content that will be useful for all Muslims in this world and in the world thereafter
# Important events all over the world in favor of or in disfavor of Muslims
# Issues in the Muslim world
# Political and economical aspects of society and worldwide 
* Attendants must listen attentively to the sermon and avoid any action that might distract their attentions.
* The Prophet Muhammad &quot;has forbidden a person with his knees drawn up touching his abdomen while the imam is delivering the Friday sermon.&quot;

===Jumu&#x27;ah prayer===
* Juum&#x27;ah prayer consists of two rak&#x27;ats prayers, as with morning prayer (fajr), offered immediately after Khutbah (the sermon). It is a replacement of Zuhr prayer.

===Qunut===
*According to Shi&#x27;ite doctrine, two qunut (raising one&#x27;s hands for supplication during salat) is especially recommended during salatul Jum&#x27;ah. The first Qunut is offered in the 1st rak&#x27;at before ruku&#x27; and the second is offered in the 2nd rak&#x27;at after rising from ruku&#x27;.

<text>is a six-volume manga series written and illustrated by Yuuichi Hasegawa based on notes and information by Yoshiyuki Tomino, serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; magazine from December 1994 to March 1997 issues. A sequel to the animated theatrical film &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam F91&quot;, &quot;Crossbone&quot; has been officially distributed only in Japan and Italy. Numerous sequels written and illustrated by Hasegawa without Tomino&#x27;s involvement have been published in &quot;Gundam Ace&quot;.

==Plot==

In Universal Century (UC) 0133, ten years after the events of &quot;F91&quot;, Crossbone Vanguard forces attack a transport ship called the Smashion as it heads to the space colonies run by the Jupiter Empire. Tobia Arronax, a 13-year-old boy aboard the ship, flies out in a Batara mobile suit to fight the Crossbone Vanguard, who have long been derided as space pirates. Unfortunately, he is captured by Crossbone Vanguard ace pilot Seabook Arno, who now goes by the name Kincade Nau and brought before their leader, Berah Ronah, who offers him to join the Vanguard or go to Jupiter and forget the attack.

Tobia decides to be with the Vanguard, who reveal to him that the Jupiter Empire has spent several years building up its military strength to destroy the Earth Federation, with whom it has a partnership. Now armed with this information, Tobia is trained in mobile suit piloting by Kincaid and to discover his own Newtype abilities. He flies into action as pilot of the XM-X3 Crossbone Gundam X-3 mobile suit.

==Characters==

*: The series&#x27; main protagonist, Tobia is a young student from Earth sent to live in the Jupiter Empire colonies. As soon as he arrives on Jupiter, he becomes wrapped up in the Jupiter War after the new Crossbone Vanguard attacks his ship, causing him to hijack a Bataras mobile suit before encountering Kincaide Nau in the Crossbone X-1. The truth becomes harder to swallow after Tobia learns that his teacher, Prof. Karas, is a Jupiter Empire agent. Determined to end the war, Tobia is often short-tempered, letting his emotions get the best of him in battle, while Kincaide continues to help him. As Tobia joins the Crossbone Vanguard, he gets behind the controls of the Crossbone Gundam X-3.
* / Seabook Arno: The Gundam F91&#x27;s former pilot and Tobia&#x27;s mentor, Seabook was presumed dead in the wake of a terrorist attack on a Crossbone Vanguard ship five years after the events of &quot;F91&quot;. By the time of Crossbone Gundam, he and Berah Ronah are running a new Crossbone Vanguard as a pirate force attacking Jupiter Empire ships.
* / Cecily Fairchild : Another character from F91, Berah comes from the Ronah family who founded the Crossbone Vanguard. After the collapse of the original Crossbone Vanguard, she and Seabook were presumed dead during an incident in UC 0128. The two spend the next five years assembling a new Crossbone Vanguard to attack the Jupiter Empire, with Berah leading the group from aboard the &quot;Mother Vanguard 2&quot;. Kind, calm and a skilled commander, Berah still cares deeply for Seabook.
*: A young girl who, after arriving on Jupiter at the same time as Tobia, later stows away on board the Mother Vanguard. Kind, quiet, and highly concerned for Tobia&#x27;s safety, Briett wishies to visit Earth, her mother&#x27;s birthplace. The Crossbone Vanguard discovers she is , daughter of Jupiter Empire leader Crux Dogatie.
*: The third returning character from &quot;F91&quot;, Zabine serves with Berah&#x27;s Crossbone Vanguard as the pilot of the Crossbone Gundam X-2. However, he still carries a grudge against Seabook. Unknown to everyone else, he is working for the revival of the original Crossbone Vanguard&#x27;s plans for &quot;Cosmo Babylonia&quot;, out of disillusionment with the ideals espoused by Berah&#x27;s Vanguard.
*: The Jupiter Empire&#x27;s supreme leader, Dogatie is maintaining a peaceful alliance with the Earth Federation while covertly assembling his army for a strike against the Earth Sphere.

<text>The meaning of maintenance mode depends on the context.

In the world of software development, it refers to a point in a computer program&#x27;s life when it has reached all of its goals and is generally considered to be &quot;complete&quot; and bug-free. The term can also refer to the point in a software product&#x27;s evolution when it is no longer competitive with other products or current with regard to the technology environment it operates within. In both cases, continued development is deemed unnecessary or ill-advised, but occasional bug fixes and security patches are still issued, hence the term maintenance mode. Maintenance mode often transitions to abandonware.

In the world of software maintenance, it refers to the operational mode a device or service may enter when it is being maintained. For example, while diagnosing, reconfiguring, repairing, upgrading or testing it may be necessary for the device or service to drop to maintenance mode until its fitness for operational mode is verified. Another use case is deliberately putting the device or service into maintenance mode so that it cannot be used operationally while being maintained.

Sometimes, when a popular free software project undergoes a major overhaul, the pre-overhaul version is kept active and put into maintenance mode because it will still be widely used in production for the foreseeable future. Project forks can also spawn from programs that go into maintenance mode too soon or have enough developer support for a more advanced version. A good example of this is the vi editor, which was in maintenance mode and forked into Vi IMproved. The Vim fork has many useful features that vi does not, such as syntax highlighting and the ability to have multiple open buffers.

<doc id="1162633" wikidata="Q595737" url="?curid=1162633" title="Josh Mathews">
<text>Joshua Matthew Lomberger (born November 25, 1980), better known by the ring name Josh Mathews, is an American professional wrestling producer, former play by play commentator, and former professional wrestler. He is best known for his time in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and WWE.

==Professional wrestling career==

=== World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE (2001–2014) ===

====Tough Enough and backstage interviewer (2001–2006)====
Lomberger was a runner-up to Maven and Nidia in the first &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot; in 2001.

Lomberger was eventually hired by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and began using the name Josh Mathews. In December 2002, he began appearing as the backstage interviewer for the SmackDown! brand and as an announcer on &quot;Velocity&quot;. He also hosted the WWE webcast &quot;Byte This!&quot; after Kevin Kelly was released. He later hosted several shows on WWE&#x27;s official website, including &quot;Weekly Top 5&quot;, &quot;The WWE Experience&quot;, and &quot;After Burn&quot;. In 2003, Mathews also stood in for Tony Chimel as ring announcer for &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

In 2004, Mathews was given some limited ring time on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; when John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) slapped Mathews for not showing respect to JBL&#x27;s chief of staff Orlando Jordan when he was interviewing him. He later offered and was accepted to be Booker T&#x27;s temporary partner for a tag team match on an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He and Booker T ultimately won the match. He was later assaulted by Jordan and requested from General Manager Theodore Long that he be given a one-on-one match against him. Booker T wanted to be at ringside during the Mathews-Jordan match, as JBL would no doubt be present, and would give Booker T an excuse to beat down JBL before their match at Survivor Series. Mathews once again emerged victorious against Jordan, with some considerable help from Booker T. He also tried to help Booker T in his WWE Championship match at the Survivor Series, but was given a Clothesline From Hell by JBL for his efforts. On the March 31, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Mathews was attacked by Kurt Angle. Mathews was then possessed by The Undertaker on the December 9, 2005 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; while interviewing Randy Orton.

====Commentator (2006–2014)====
Mathews filled in for an absent Todd Grisham on a summer 2006 episode of &quot;Raw.&quot; He also hosted pre-shows for WWE pay-per-view events, and he provided color commentary on &quot;Heat&quot; from time to time before the show was cancelled in May 2008. He was the host of WWE.com&#x27;s Weekly Top Five when it started and hosted it until April 2009 when he was replaced by Jack Korpela. During Todd Grisham&#x27;s stint as ECW commentator, Mathews replaced him as Raw&#x27;s backstage interviewer. Mathews, along with WWE Diva Candice Michelle were WWE&#x27;s correspondents at both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in an effort to encourage WWE fans to register to vote for the 2008 Presidential election.

On the April 7, 2009, episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Mathews was announced as the new play-by-play commentator, as the previous commentator, Todd Grisham was moved to &quot;SmackDown&quot; after Tazz departed WWE. In addition to commentating on ECW and ECW pay-per-view matches, Mathews along with Matt Striker represented the ECW brand on &quot;Superstars&quot; every week starting with the inaugural episode on April 16, 2009. After ECW&#x27;s closure, Mathews became the color commentator of &quot;NXT&quot;. On the April 9, 2010 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Mathews was attacked with a sleeper hold by Dolph Ziggler when he was interviewing him. On December 10, Mathews officially replaced Todd Grisham as the play-by-play commentator for &quot;SmackDown&quot;, commentating alongside Michael Cole and Striker. On the February 4, 2011, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Mathews and Cole were joined by Booker T, forming a three-man announce team. Mathews was replaced by William Regal as a commentator on season five of &quot;NXT&quot; in 2011.

In late 2010, Mathews often worked as the color commentator on &quot;Raw&quot; due to Jerry Lawler&#x27;s increased in-ring competition. On April 3, 2011, Mathews commentated the majority of WrestleMania XXVII, though he received a &#x27;Stone Cold Stunner&#x27; from an angered Stone Cold Steve Austin, cutting his night short. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Mathews found himself aligned with Jerry Lawler, and against Michael Cole. He then became the alternate spokesman for the Anonymous Raw General Manager, when Michael Cole was not commentating. He then using the new catchphrase &quot;The Anonymous &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager says...&quot;, before reading each e-mail. On the April 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mathews announced that the Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler vs. Michael Cole and Jack Swagger match at Extreme Rules will be a Country Whipping match, which Cole and Swagger won. At the following pay-per-view, Over the Limit, Mathews supported Lawler, Bret Hart and Eve Torres in having Michael Cole kiss Lawler&#x27;s foot. The following night, again as the spokesman for the anonymous Raw General Manager, Mathews read the e-mail that denied The Miz&#x27;s request for another title shot, seemingly done with John Cena. He left the &quot;Raw&quot; broadcasting table the following week, after Cole and Lawler reconciled, though he remained on the show as a backstage interviewer and backup commentator.

Mathews reunited with his former &quot;ECW&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; broadcast partner Matt Striker on the November 10, 2011 episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, becoming the full-time broadcasting team. He and Striker also called the November 9, 2011 broadcast of &quot;NXT&quot;, marking his second return to the show since his original run ended after season four. On the April 23, 2012 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Mathews was throttled by Brock Lesnar after Lesnar believed Mathews had made a smart-aleck comment towards him. Later in the year, he was attacked at SummerSlam, this time by Kane, who was angry over being defeated by Daniel Bryan. Mathews was again attacked by Kane on August 31, 2012 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; after he lost his match against Alberto Del Rio.

Mathews was the play-by-play commentator of &quot;Saturday Morning Slam&quot; throughout the show&#x27;s 2012–2013 run. He was also a commentator of &quot;Main Event&quot;. On September 27, 2013, he started as commentator of &quot;Superstars&quot; with Tom Phillips. On October 18, 2013 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Alberto Del Rio attacked Mathews while threatening John Cena about what he was going to do to him in Hell in a Cell. On June 25, 2014, Mathews was released from WWE.

=== Total Nonstop Action Impact Wrestling (2014–2025)===

After being released from WWE, it was reported that Lomberger had signed with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) to work in their offices in Nashville. Throughout November and December, Mathews appeared in episodes of &quot;#ImWithSpud&quot; on TNA&#x27;s YouTube channel. In December 2014, TNA confirmed that Mathews would take Mike Tenay&#x27;s place. In January 2015, Mathews was the lead announcer of &quot;Impact! (TV series)&quot; alongside Taz. On June 3, 2015, D&#x27;Angelo Dinero officially joined Mathews as his broadcast partner for &quot;TNA Wrestling&quot;.

On the March 2, 2017 episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Mathews turned heel that night when he began favoring heel wrestlers over face wrestlers. He continuously praised himself, and he argued with D&#x27;Angelo Dinero throughout the broadcast. In April, Mathews had a series of arguments with Jeremy Borash and the two started a heated rivalry, which seemed to culminate in a match where Mathews and Borash formed teams of four wrestlers to compete against each other, with the team Mathews created ending up on the losing side, meaning he would no longer be lead-commentator. However, on April 21, Mathews returned to ringside accompanying Ethan Carter III, and joined Borash and Dinero, providing commentary, again belittling the wrestlers who the fans cheered for. At Slammiversary XV, Mathews teamed with Scott Steiner against Jeremy Borash and Joseph Park in a losing effort. On January 13, 2018, Matt Sydal turned heel and gifted his Impact Grand Championship to Mathews, only for Sydal to drop the belt to Austin Aries while defending it on Mathews&#x27; behalf. Following this, Mathews&#x27; heel commentator status was phased out.

Mathews ceased to be TNA&#x27;s main play-by-play announcer following 2021 Hard To Kill, though he still occasionally filled in at shows when new lead Matt Striker was unavailable.

On February 12, 2025, it was reported that Mathews had parted ways with TNA ending his decade tenure with the company.

==Personal life==
Lomberger was previously married to Rue DeBona from November 2006 until their divorce in 2008. In August 2015, Lomberger married Ashley Simmons, best known by her ring name Madison Rayne.

Mathews, along with Batista, Shelton Benjamin and Candice Michelle, represented WWE at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in an effort to persuade fans to register to vote in the 2008 presidential election.

<text>WBLS (107.5 MHz) is an urban adult contemporary formatted FM radio station, licensed to New York, New York. It is currently owned and operated by Mediaco Holding, along with sister station WQHT (97.1 FM). The stations share studios in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, and WBLS&#x27; transmitter is located at the Empire State Building. It was previously owned by YMF Media LLC, owned jointly by investor Ronald Burkle and Magic Johnson, which had assumed control of WBLS and WLIB&#x27;s former parent company, Inner City Broadcasting Corporation, on October 19, 2012, at a purchase price of $180 million.

==History==
===Early years===
The 107.5 frequency in New York City signed on in July 1951 as WEVD-FM, simulcasting its sister station at 1330 AM. Within a few years, WEVD-FM moved to 97.9, and 107.5 went off the air.

Several years later the New Broadcasting Company, then-owners of WLIB, was awarded a construction permit for the dormant frequency and on September 15, 1965, WLIB-FM signed on. As the Federal Communications Commission had recently instituted a rule prohibiting full-time AM/FM simulcasting in large markets, WLIB-FM was programmed with a Jazz format. The stations were split up in 1972, when Inner City Broadcasting purchased WLIB (AM); WLIB-FM was then renamed WBLS. Inner City reunited the pair with its purchase of WBLS in 1974.

From 1972 to 1978, WBLS was the flagship station of the Mutual Black Network (now the American Urban Radio Networks).

As part of the Inner City Broadcasting Corporation stations, program director Frankie Crocker held 5% of the radio market in the northeast from 1975 to 1978, only ceding the title of top R&amp;B station to upstart WKTU when that station broke out playing disco and club music in 1979. By 1982 it had fallen to number 3 in the market.

In 1993, Calvin O. Butts, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, led a threat to boycott the station if they played any form of gangsta rap. Butts&#x27; protests culminated in his bulldozing a pile of hip-hop recordings during a rally. In response to the protests, WBLS excised most hip hop music from its air and carefully screened what it did play for content and language.

In 1995, after WRKS was purchased by Emmis Communications and dropped all hip-hop music in favor of a similar adult R&amp;B format, WBLS countered with a controversial advertising campaign labeling WRKS as a &quot;plantation station.&quot; WBLS shortly reverted to urban contemporary, only to exit again in 2004 when WBLS switched to urban adult contemporary.

===2010–present===

From 2010 to 2015, former Nation of Islam minister and &quot;Hip Hop Minister&quot; Conrad Tillard served as a radio talk show host on WBLS, which broadcast his hour-long &quot;Sunday Night Live&quot; community-issues program for five years.

WBLS acquired WRKS&#x27;s intellectual property in a merger of the two outlets announced on April 26, with a joint statement on both stations&#x27; respective websites. In addition to acquiring WRKS&#x27;s intellectual property, WBLS and WLIB also moved into Emmis&#x27;s New York production facility in the West Village section of Manhattan, into studio space vacated by WRKS during the week of May 21, 2012.

During the 2012-13 NBA season, WBLS broadcast selected New York Knicks games in an agreement with WEPN-FM. These games conflicted with WEPN-FM&#x27;s coverage of the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets when both teams were scheduled to play on Sunday afternoons.

On February 11, 2014, Emmis Communications announced it would purchase WBLS and WLIB from YMF Media LLC for $131 million, pending FCC approval. The purchase was consummated on June 10, 2014. On July 1, 2019, Emmis announced that it would sell WBLS and WQHT to the public company Mediaco Holding—an affiliate of Standard General—for $91.5 million and a $5 million promissory note. Emmis will be a shareholder in Mediaco Holding and continue to operate the stations. The sale was consummated on November 25, 2019.

== Online ==
In 2000 WBLS launched its interactive sister site WBLSi with radio internet convergence company FMITV in Burbank, California, WBLSi.com featured live original music streams to cater to a variety of tastes – The Jamz, Slow Jamz, Hip-Hop and WBLS Classics with on-demand access to concerts and music videos. Wendy Williams, Egypt Sherrod, and &quot;Rap City&quot;&#x27;s Big Lez doubled on the online platform as IJ&#x27;s or WBLS&#x27; the first internet jockeys. The first internet program director of WBLSi was Hakeem Khaaliq.

<text>James Forbes (September 2, 1871 – May 26, 1938) was a Canadian playwright who worked as a Hollywood film screenwriter. &quot;The Chorus Lady&quot; and &quot;The Famous Mrs. Fair&quot; were his best known plays.

==Biography==
Of Scottish ancestry, Forbes was born September 2, 1871, in Salem, Centre Wellington, Ontario, and he received his education from the College Institute of Galt, Ontario. Becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1892, he had already begun his career as an actor in Chicago in 1891. Early in 1897 he accepted the position of drama critic for the &quot;Pittsburgh Dispatch&quot;. In 1897 he became the assistant drama editor of the &quot;New York World&quot; and in 1898 he accepted the position of business manager for Henry W. Savage&#x27;s Castle Square Opera Company. In 1901 he became the assistant manager of the newly established Henry B. Harris theatrical enterprises.
Before turning to play-writing, Forbes published several short stories, which were written entirely in dialogue. In 1904 he adapted one of his stories into a one-act vaudeville sketch entitled &quot;The Chorus Lady&quot;. Created for Rose Stahl, an actress with whom Forbes had worked, the sketch was very successful in New York, and it then had a successful tour in the United States and England. Forbes expanded the sketch into a full-length comedy, and the 1906 production, again with Rose Stahl, had such great success that Forbes&#x27;s entree into play-writing was insured. He continued to write plays, including several social comedies, and during the next twenty years he carved himself a niche as a highly acclaimed and popular playwright.

Forbes achieved his greatest success in 1919 with &quot;The Famous Mrs. Fair&quot;, a social comedy dealing with the adjustments a woman faces upon returning home from her work in the war effort in France during World War I. He scored other successes commercially and critically, but his interest and abilities in other aspects of theatre kept him from devoting all his time to writing. He also directed plays, mostly his own, but others as well, and tried his hand at producing. In the 1920s and early 1930s his two main interests, writing and directing, led him to Hollywood, where he either wrote the screenplays for or directed the dialogue for a number of MGM films. Five of his own plays were made into movies. Forbes also combined latent administrative talent with his theatrical interests in aiding in the formulation of the Over There Theatre League during World War I to entertain American forces overseas and organizing and directing a stock acting company under the auspices of the League which toured bases in France. He subsequently aided in the founding of the Dramatists&#x27; Guild of the Authors&#x27; League of America and joined with fellow playwrights to form a producing organization called the Dramatists&#x27; Theatre, Inc.

In the 1920s he was lured to Hollywood as a screenwriter for Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle and Norma Shearer, for whom he also served as a voice coach. Even though he was Canadian-born and -educated, his plays were based on themes and characters wholly indigenous to the United States. He was keenly observant of issues and trends between 1905 and 1929. Interested in the continued movement toward urbanization, he often contrasted small-town and city life and satirized concurrent social climbing. Reflecting the fomentation in the area of women&#x27;s rights, he wrote several plays dealing with this issue.

Forbes married Ada Eugenie Fischer (1876–1938) on September 21, 1901. They had a son, Anthony Henry Forbes (1910–1999). Forbes worked with theatrical producer Henry B. Harris and occasionally travelled to Europe with him on business. On July 3, 1908, Forbes, Harris and their wives, Ada and Irene, arrived in New York on the ocean liner, the RMS &quot;Baltic&quot;, after one such trip.

Forbes died while in Germany in 1938.

<text>James Ricardo Forbes (July 18, 1952 – January 21, 2022) was an American basketball player. His college career at the University of Texas at El Paso was crowned by his participation at the 1972 Olympics as a member of the youngest-ever U.S. team. Forbes played in the highly controversial 1972 Olympic Men&#x27;s Basketball Final, which ended in a loss for his team. Protesting refereeing in that match, he and the rest of the team have never accepted the silver medal.

==Life and career==
Forbes was born in Fort Rucker, Alabama, on July 18, 1952. He attended Bel Air High School in El Paso, Texas. He was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the fourth round of the 1974 NBA draft, but he never played professionally. Forbes was later an assistant coach for the UTEP Miners before going to coach high school basketball in El Paso. As a high school coach, he guided the Riverside Rangers to the Texas 5A Final Four in 1995 and the Andress Eagles to the Texas 5A Sweet Sixteen in 2009. Forbes has more than 700 career high school coaching victories.

Forbes died from complications of COVID-19 in El Paso, on January 21, 2022, at the age of 69.

<text>The Tyne-Tees Regiment was a regiment of the British Territorial Army. The regiment was part of 15 (North East) Brigade and was the Territorial unit of infantry in the area stretching from Scarborough in North Yorkshire, to Alnwick in Northumberland.

==History==
The regiment was formed in 1999 by the amalgamation of the 6th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, 4th/5th Battalion The Green Howards (Yorkshire Volunteers) and 7th Battalion, The Light Infantry due to the implementation of the reforms of the Territorial Army envisaged in the Strategic Defence Review. The HQ was at Durham, and the regiment was composed of a headquarters company and five companies:
*HQ Company, at Gilesgate Armoury, Durham
*A (Green Howards) Company, at Scarborough and Northallerton
*B (Green Howards) Company, at Middlesbrough, and Coulby Newham
*C (Durham Light Infantry) Company, at Bishop Auckland, Consett, and Washington
*X (Fusilier) Company, at Newcastle upon Tyne and Alnwick
*Z (Fusilier) Company, at Ashington and Tynemouth

No new cap badge was created for this regiment, soldiers wore their former regimental cap badge or were badged according to the company they joined. On 4 July 2003, a composite company was dispatched to Iraq and was the first TA Infantry unit to be compulsorily mobilised since the Suez Crisis in 1956. The three platoons deployed served at Basra Palace, Basra Airport and Shaibah Logistics Base and were rotated around at intervals during this difficult and unstable period in Iraq&#x27;s history.

In 2004, a platoon was deployed to Iraq as part of Normandy Company of The East and West Riding Regiment. During this tour, Normandy Company suffered one fatality, Private Mark Stephen Dobson of the Tyne-Tees Regiment, who was found dead in his accommodation at Basrah Air Station on 28 March 2005.

As part of the restructuring of the infantry announced in 2004, the Tyne-Tees Regiment was broken up, with its constituent companies going to their parent regiments:
*A &amp; B Companies merged to form B Company, 4th Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment on 6 June 2006.
*X, Z and C Companies formed the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers
*Minden (Light Infantry) Company, formerly of The East and West Riding Regiment, was broken up with the Doncaster detachment joining C (Durham Light Infantry) Company as the (Yorkshire Light Infantry) Platoon. The rest of the Wakefield-based Company formed the nucleus of the newly created 299 Parachute Squadron, Royal Engineers.

<doc id="1162661" wikidata="Q12314999" url="?curid=1162661" title="Hagbard and Signy">
<text>Hagbard and Signe (Signy) (the Viking Age) or Habor and Sign(h)ild (the Middle Ages and later) were a pair of lovers in Scandinavian mythology and folklore whose legend was widely popular. The heroes&#x27; connections with other legendary characters place the events in the 5th century AD. Hagbard and his brother Haki were famous sea-kings (see Haki for his battles over the throne of Sweden). Like the name Hagbard (&quot;Hagbarðr&quot;), the legend is believed to have continental Germanic origins.

==Storyline==
During the centuries of popularity the story changed. This is the most comprehensive version from &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (book 7).

Hagbard was the son of Haamund while Signy was the daughter of Sigar. Once, when Hagbard and his brothers were pillaging, they started to fight with Signy&#x27;s brothers. The battle was even and they finally decided to have peace. Hagbard followed Signy&#x27;s brothers and managed to be alone with Signy in secret. She promised him her love, in spite of being more interested in Haki, the more famous brother.

When a German nobleman proposed to Signy, it became apparent that she was more interested in Hagbard. The German, then, started intriguing and created an animosity between the two groups of brothers. There was a battle and Hagbard&#x27;s brothers were killed, after which honour obliged Hagbard to slay Signy&#x27;s brothers and the German suitor.

In order to meet Signy, Hagbard dressed up as a woman and claimed to be his brother Haki&#x27;s shieldmaiden. Haki had not been involved in the battles with Signy&#x27;s brothers, and he was the one whom Signy really had wanted. Hagbard, however, trusted in Signy&#x27;s promise to him.

Since he was dressed as a woman, Hagbard was offered to sleep among Signy&#x27;s handmaidens. When the handmaidens washed his legs, they asked him why they were so furry and why his hands were so calloused. Because of this, he invented a clever verse to explain his strange appearance. Signy, however, understanding that it was Hagbard who had come to see her, explained to the maidens that his verse was truthful.

During the night, they exchanged promises of eternal love and faithfulness. These promises filled Hagbard with such pleasure that he did not fear meeting her father and brothers if he were discovered leaving her chamber.

Hagbard was deceived by the handmaidens and he was arrested by Sigar&#x27;s men. He defended himself well and slew many of the men. He was, however, defeated and taken to the thing, where the people had different opinions. Some claimed that he should be killed, whereas others claimed that it would be a shame to lose such a brave warrior. It was decided that the king&#x27;s honour had to be protected and Hagbard killed.

The gallows were constructed, while the queen gave him a drink to quench his thirst. She mocked him, but Hagbard answered, &quot;I will drink a last toast, and I take the horn of death with the same hand as with the one I sent your two sons to the goddess Hel. I will not die without revenge&quot;. Then, he threw the horn onto her head so that the mead ran over her face. 

During this time, Signy was amongst her crying maidens, asking them if they were willing to follow her wherever she would go. Crying, she told them that she would die with the only man she had embraced in life. Then she asked them to set her chamber on fire as soon as the watchman signalled the execution. They all vowed to die with her. 

Hagbard was brought to a hill, which is named after him, to be hanged. In order to test his fiancée&#x27;s fidelity, he asked the hangmen to first hang his coat. He explained that it would please him to get an impression of how he would look when dead.

His last wish was granted, and the watchman, who thought it was Hagbard who was hanging, signalled so to the maidens who were gathered around Signy in the hill fort. The maidens set the house on fire and hanged themselves in the flames.

When Hagbard saw that the king&#x27;s hill fort was aflame, he felt more joy about his loved one&#x27;s faithfulness than sorrow about his own impending death. He exclaimed poetically his happiness, whereupon he was immediately hanged.

The song of Habor and Signhild (TSB D 430) was very popular and it was sung all over Scandinavia for centuries. It has also been subjected to scholarly analysis in many ways. It has been claimed that it was sung as early as the 13th century, and in Sweden it exists in many versions ranging from handwritten ditties from the early 17th century to eighteen chapbooks from the period 1638–1839. In the 17th century, it seems to have been Sweden&#x27;s most popular folk song. There were also many versions in Denmark and Norway.

The folk song is still known among non-scholars.

==Locations==
The Danes claimed very early that the name &quot;Sigari oppidum&quot; (Sigar&#x27;s hill fort) referred to the Swedish Sigerstad in Halland between Halmstad and Falkenberg, where there are many monuments about the legend, such as &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s gallows&quot;, &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s stones&quot;, &quot;Siger&#x27;s hill&quot;, &quot;Signy&#x27;s chamber&quot;, &quot;Signy&#x27;s well&quot; and &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s mound&quot;. These monuments are all mentioned in Tuneld, &quot;Geografie Ofver Konungariket Swerige&quot; (1793). 

A second Dane wrote in 1779 that the most likely location was in Blekinge, where there are a &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s oak&quot; and a &quot;Signy&#x27;s chamber&quot;. There is also a location in Närke named Segersjö (Sigar&#x27;s lake) which has two cairns called &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s cairn&quot; and &quot;Signy&#x27;s cairn&quot;. There are also locations in Norway.

Laurentius Petri wrote in the &quot;Svenska Krönikan&quot; (Swedish chronicle) in 1559 that there were many traditions about Habardh and Signill. According to the songs, Hagbard was not Swedish, but the son of a Norwegian king, and Signy was a Swedish princess. The songs also related that Hagbard was hanged not far from Sigtuna in Uppland, where there was a plain called &quot;Hagbard&#x27;s plain&quot; in Håtuna Parish.

This placed the events in Old Sigtuna, a version that Johannes Messenius wanted to confirm in &quot;Sveopentaprotopolis&quot; (1611). He argued that the names in the area of Old Sigtuna contradicted the Danish claims of a Danish location. Later in &quot;Scondia illustrata&quot;, he contradicted his claims and said that Signill was rather a Danish princess and Habor a Norwegian. However, in 1612, he reasserted that Signy was a Swedish princess, in Old Sigtuna.

In 1678, Old Sigtuna was renamed &quot;Sighildsberg&quot; in honour of Signy. The interest continued unabated for centuries.

<doc id="1162672" wikidata="Q259261" url="?curid=1162672" title="Eddie (Iron Maiden)">
<text>Eddie (also known as Eddie the Head) is the mascot for the English heavy metal band Iron Maiden. He is a perennial fixture of the group&#x27;s artwork, appearing in all of their album covers (as well as most of their singles) and in their merchandise, which includes T-shirts, posters and action figures. On top of this, Eddie features in all of the band&#x27;s concerts, as well as in the first-person shooter video game, &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;, the mobile game, &quot;Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast&quot; and a pinball game with the same name in 2018.

Originally a papier-mâché mask used in Iron Maiden&#x27;s stage backdrop, the band transferred the name &quot;Eddie&quot; from the mask to an illustration by Derek Riggs, which was used as the band&#x27;s debut album cover. Although he is occasionally described as &quot;zombie-like&quot; in the press, Eddie assumes a different guise relating to the themes of individual albums and their corresponding world tours, and has appeared as a cyborg, an Egyptian mummy, a lobotomised mental patient, a cloud, a samurai warrior, and a soldier.

==Background==
The first version of Eddie was a mask made by an art student who was friends with Dave &quot;Lights&quot; Beazley, then in charge of lighting, pyrotechnics and other effects for Iron Maiden&#x27;s live show. According to Beazley, the original mask was a papier-mâché mould of his own face, which was then used in the band&#x27;s backdrop, consisting of lights and the band&#x27;s logo. At the end of their live set, during the &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; song, a fish tank pump was used to squirt fake blood out of the mask&#x27;s mouth, which typically covered their then-drummer Doug Sampson. After this initial incarnation, Beazley constructed a larger mask out of fibreglass, equipped with flashing eyes and the ability to release red smoke from its mouth.

The band&#x27;s bassist and founding member Steve Harris states that the name &quot;Eddie&quot; comes from the original mask being referred to as &quot;The Head,&quot; which sounded like &quot;Ead&quot; in the band members&#x27; London accent. According to guitarist Dave Murray the name was also inspired by an old joke:
&quot;A wife had a baby, but it was born with only a head and no body. &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry,&#x27; says the doctor. &#x27;Bring him back in five years time, and we&#x27;ll probably have a body for him.&#x27; So five years go by, and there&#x27;s Eddie the &#x27;Ead, as his parents have called him, sitting on the mantelpiece, when in walks his dad. &#x27;Son,&#x27; he says, &#x27;today&#x27;s a very special day. It&#x27;s your fifth birthday, and we&#x27;ve got a very special surprise for you.&#x27; &#x27;Oh no,&#x27; says Eddie. &#x27;Not another fucking hat!

Once Iron Maiden had secured a record contract with EMI, the band&#x27;s manager Rod Smallwood decided that the band needed &quot;that one figure who utterly stamped his presence and image on the band in a way that was obvious enough to make a good album cover.&quot; After seeing some of his artwork on a Max Middleton poster, Smallwood set up a meeting with Derek Riggs and asked to see some of his other illustrations, in the midst of which was the band&#x27;s first album cover. Originally created as an idea for a punk record (which Riggs states in the &quot;12 Wasted Years&quot; documentary was based on an alleged Japanese soldier&#x27;s skull stuck to an American tank), the band had extra hair added to the illustration, making it more suitable to their style of music, and transferred the name from the original masks they used onstage. Surmising that the creature had &quot;great visual continuity,&quot; Smallwood decided it would be used for all of the band&#x27;s artwork.

Smallwood claims that Rupert Perry, EMI&#x27;s then-managing director, came up with the idea that Eddie could become a more active part of the band&#x27;s concerts, originally portrayed by Smallwood himself, wearing an Eddie mask and a leather jacket. The classic &quot;walk-on&quot; Eddie was created for The Beast on the Road tour by Dave Beazley after seeing a pantomime version of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk,&quot; which used similar giants, consisting of &quot;basically a bloke on stilts but dressed up to look about tall.&quot; As the band&#x27;s stage show expanded, an additional gigantic Eddie was also incorporated at the back of the set during &quot;Iron Maiden,&quot; which, like the &quot;walk-on&quot; Eddie, would match the theme of the current tour, such as the , mummified version used during the World Slavery Tour, which shot sparks from its eyes.

Eddie&#x27;s debut appearance was on the band&#x27;s first single cover, &quot;Running Free,&quot; in which his face was covered by a shadow to protect his identity before the release of the band&#x27;s first album. Since then, Eddie has assumed a different guise for each cover, such as a &quot;mummified Egyptian god&quot; for &quot;Powerslave,&quot; a lobotomized mental patient for &quot;Piece of Mind,&quot; emerging from a grave in &quot;Live After Death&quot;, a tree monster for &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; and a cyborg for &quot;Somewhere in Time.&quot; In addition to the band&#x27;s album covers and live shows, the character also appears in merchandise including T-shirts, posters and action figures, as well as the group&#x27;s two video games: the 1999 first-person shooter, &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;, and the 2016 role-playing game &quot;Iron Maiden: Legacy of the Beast.&quot; On top of this, Eddie is featured as an unlockable character in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; and as Legendary skins in &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;.

==Controversies==

Some of the band&#x27;s artworks have proved controversial, such as the cover of &quot;Sanctuary,&quot; in which Eddie can be seen standing over the corpse of Margaret Thatcher. It was claimed that Iron Maiden were banned from releasing the single without censoring the cover, blacking out Thatcher&#x27;s face, although Riggs has since claimed that this was fabricated by the band&#x27;s management to gain publicity in the British tabloids.

The artwork for the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, depicted Eddie controlling Satan like a marionette. Originally created by Riggs for the &quot;Purgatory&quot; single cover, but deemed too good by Smallwood and withheld for the next studio release, the image, along with the record&#x27;s title track, led to the Moral Majority labelling Iron Maiden as Satanists and organizing public burnings of their back-catalogue in the United States, which in turn gave them a large amount of publicity.

During the course of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, Eddie, specifically as he appeared on the sleeve of &quot;The Trooper&quot;, became an unofficial mascot of the Ulster Freedom Fighters loyalist paramilitary group and was the main figure on a number of the group&#x27;s murals. During The Final Frontier World Tour in 2011, after Iron Maiden did not perform &quot;The Trooper&quot; in Belfast, Blabbermouth.net reported that there had been speculation amongst fans that this was due to the artwork&#x27;s use in murals.

One last uproar that Eddie caused was when a picture representing him biting off Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s head (in response to Osbourne&#x27;s biting the head off a live bat on stage) went unappreciated by those in Osbourne&#x27;s camp; therefore, Maiden withdrew the drawing.

==Recognition==
Gibson.com described Eddie in 2008 as &quot;the most recognizable metal icon in the world and one of the most versatile too,&quot; while in 2009, &quot;Gigwise&quot; called him &quot;perhaps the most enduring band mascot of all time.&quot; Many artists who have been influenced by Iron Maiden hold their artwork in high regard, with Joey Jordison, former member of Slipknot commenting that he bought his first album &quot;on the strength of the cover alone&quot; and Corey Taylor, also of Slipknot, stating that &quot;there wasn&#x27;t a dude that I hung out with that wasn&#x27;t trying to draw Eddie on their schoolbooks.&quot; Steve-O, from Jackass, says that they have &quot;the coolest album covers in the music industry&quot; and Lars Ulrich, of Metallica, comments that &quot;they had the best packaging, the coolest T-shirts — everything.&quot; Mick Wall describes Eddie as &quot;the immortal soul of Iron Maiden, the defining symbol of the eternally youthful, blissfully uncompromising spirit of the band&#x27;s music.&quot;

In 2008, Eddie won the &quot;Icon Award&quot; at the Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards.

In 2023, Eddie was featured on a series of commemorative stamps issued by the Royal Mail.

== Other artists ==

From 1980 onwards, the band&#x27;s Eddie artwork was provided exclusively by Derek Riggs until 1992, when the band decided to accept contributions from other artists, with Smallwood explaining that they &quot;wanted to upgrade Eddie for the &#x27;90s. We wanted to take him from this sort of comic-book horror creature and turn him into something a bit more straightforward so that he became even more threatening.&quot; Since then, Riggs has contributed much less to the band&#x27;s artwork, creating part of one studio album, one single and two compilation covers, while the band have employed a number of different artists:

* Melvyn Grant first drew Eddie for the &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; sleeve, the first time anyone other than Riggs had designed a cover for Iron Maiden in which Eddie was pictured. Grant also worked on the &quot;Virtual XI&quot;, &quot;Death on the Road&quot;, &quot;The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg&quot;, &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; and &quot;From Fear to Eternity&quot; covers.

* Mark Wilkinson depicted Eddie as a bat for the poster of their 1992 Monsters of Rock appearance, which was later used for the cover of the &quot;Live at Donington&quot; remaster. Wilkinson has also contributed to &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; singles, as well as the &quot;Best of the &#x27;B&#x27; Sides&quot; compilation, the 2015 studio album, &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;, and the 2021 studio album, &quot;Senjutsu&quot;.
* Hugh Syme, noted for both his album cover work and guest musician appearances for the Canadian progressive rock band Rush, provided the modelled artwork for &quot;The X Factor&quot;.
* Tom Adams provided the artwork to &quot;Edward the Great&quot;, showing Eddie as a King on a throne.
* Director Bob Cesca of Camp Chaos created animations of various past Eddie incarnations for new versions of the &quot;Aces High&quot;, &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot;, &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;The Trooper&quot; music videos, included in the &quot;Visions of the Beast&quot; DVD.

* Although not listed on the record&#x27;s release, the &quot;From Fear to Eternity&quot; album sleeve credits David Patchett with creating the &quot;Dance of Death&quot; cover. According to MusicRadar, Patchett asked for his name to be removed from the album&#x27;s credits after the band decided to use an unfinished version of his design. The artwork was negatively received, with Sputnikmusic deeming it &quot;terrible&quot;.
* Tim Bradstreet, best known for his contributions to &quot;The Punisher&quot; comics, created the cover of &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot;.
* Anthony Dry created the &quot;El Dorado&quot; and &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; radio promo covers, featuring Melvyn Grant&#x27;s &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; Eddie in a comic book cover style.

==Various incarnations==

* Iron Maiden, the first artwork featuring Eddie, originally created for a possible punk record, based on an American&#x27;s head allegedly stuck to a Vietnamese tank.
** &quot;Running Free,&quot; the band&#x27;s first release to depict Eddie, painted after the album cover so his face was hidden to protect his identity.
** &quot;Sanctuary&quot; shows Eddie wielding a knife above Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s corpse. According to Riggs, the band&#x27;s management censored the image themselves to gain publicity.
** &quot;Women in Uniform,&quot; according to Riggs, features Margaret Thatcher about to get &quot;her own back&quot; on Eddie, as she is seen waiting around a corner with a machine gun in her hands while Eddie approaches accompanied by two women.
* Killers features Eddie with an axe and his victim clawing at his shirt. Based on a block of flats in which Riggs lived at the time, it contains several references to the band, such as &quot;Ruskin Arms&quot; and &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot;.
** &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; features Eddie&#x27;s spirit reaching toward a woman through a mirror. According to Iron Maiden manager Rod Smallwood, the band was criticized because Eddie appeared to be attacking the woman.
** &quot;Purgatory&quot; depicts the devil&#x27;s face crumbling away to reveal Eddie.
* Maiden Japan shows Eddie with a samurai sword. The cover was painted at short notice as the original, featuring Eddie decapitating Paul Di&#x27;Anno, was withdrawn because the band was considering replacing him.
* The Number of the Beast depicts Eddie controlling the devil like a puppet, who, in turn, also controls a puppet Eddie, causing controversy with American evangelists. Originally painted for the &quot;Purgatory&quot; song, Smallwood withheld the artwork for the following album, deeming it too good for a single.
** &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; shows Eddie fighting Satan with a Native American tomahawk, a reference to the song itself.
** &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; single cover shows Eddie holding the devil&#x27;s severed head, which Riggs claims was meant to look like Salvador Dalí.
* Piece of Mind depicts a lobotomized Eddie in a straitjacket chained at the neck to a padded cell.
** &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; shows a metal-winged Eddie torching Icarus with a Flamethrower, which Riggs states was meant to look like Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Swan Song logo. The painting also contains a small box meant to be Eddie&#x27;s &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; padded cell.
** &quot;The Trooper&quot; depicts Eddie in a red coat uniform during the Charge of the Light Brigade.
* Powerslave features a statue of Eddie as an Egyptian pharaoh.
** &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; shows Eddie sitting in front of an atomic explosion.
** &quot;Aces High&quot; depicts Eddie in a Spitfire cockpit.
* Live After Death shows Eddie rising from the grave.
** &quot;Run to the Hills (live)&quot; contains live versions of &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and so featured Eddie as the phantom in a hilly landscape.
* Somewhere in Time depicts Eddie as a cyborg in a &quot;Blade Runner&quot;-inspired future. The cover is notable for containing dozens of Easter eggs relating to the band and pop culture references.
** &quot;Wasted Years&quot; shows a partial reflection of Eddie in a time machine&#x27;s monitor because the single came out before the album, and the band did not want to reveal Eddie&#x27;s new cyborg guise.
** &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; depicts a Clint Eastwood-like Eddie in a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-esque bar.
* Seventh Son of a Seventh Son depicts a surreal Eddie with most of his body removed, which Riggs claims was because he was &quot;sick of painting him&quot; and this would mean there would not be as much of him to draw. Riggs also comments that he set it in a &quot;polar landscape&quot; after seeing a documentary on the North Pole, and that Eddie&#x27;s head on fire was inspired by Arthur Brown.
** &quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; shows a corkscrew that is attached to a forearm and hand piercing through Eddie&#x27;s head.
** &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; artwork was drawn in a single night, according to Riggs. In it, Eddie&#x27;s face is formed from smoke, with a man held in a prison cell in his mouth, and a devil holding a contract rising from the top of his head.
** &quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; depicts Eddie with three faces, indicating the ability to see the past, present and future.
** &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;/ &quot;Maiden England&quot; features Eddie riding a motorcycle.
* No Prayer for the Dying shows Eddie bursting out of another grave. The cover originally had Eddie strangling a gravedigger while bursting from the grave. The gravedigger was removed from the cover for the 1998 remastered release. Unlike the band&#x27;s previous artwork in which he would retain the same features gained with each release (such as the &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; lobotomy), Eddie returned to how he appeared in the first few albums.
** &quot;Holy Smoke&quot; depicts Eddie destroying a group of televisions broadcasting TV evangelists, whom the song itself attacks.
** &quot;Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter&quot; featured several different covers, such as one in which Eddie is standing outside &quot;The Paradise Club&quot; (a British TV series which Bruce Dickinson featured in) with Jessica Rabbit, and one in which Eddie appears as the Grim Reaper in a graveyard.
* Fear of the Dark is the first cover not created by Derek Riggs and features Melvyn Grant&#x27;s design of Eddie as a tree monster.
** &quot;Be Quick or Be Dead&quot; shows Eddie attacking Robert Maxwell. According to Riggs, Eddie was drawn directly onto a photo of Maxwell.
* A Real Live One depicts Eddie biting through an electrical cord.
** &quot;Fear of the Dark (live)&quot; has Eddie as Steve Harris. The artwork was also used for the &quot;Raising Hell&quot; video.
* A Real Dead One features Eddie as a radio DJ.
** &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name (live)&quot; depicts lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson being skewered with a trident by Eddie, who appears as the devil. This artwork was chosen because Dickinson was leaving the band.
* Live at Donington, a re-release, depicts Eddie with a pair of wings, originally created by Mark Wilkinson for the Monsters of Rock 1992 poster.
* The X Factor, created by Hugh Syme, shows Eddie on an operating table being vivisected by machine with most of his insides showing. Due to the cover&#x27;s graphic nature, the band had to provide a less-violent alternative consisting of a similar Eddie from a distance.
** &quot;Man on the Edge&quot; is a close-up of the model&#x27;s head.
** &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, also by Syme, has Eddie in an electric chair surrounded by two giant flies.
* Best of the Beast features a selection of Riggs&#x27; past Eddies.
** &quot;Virus&quot; features two covers, one by Syme and one by Riggs featuring Eddie on a printed circuit board.
* Virtual XI, created by Melvin Grant, shows Eddie reaching toward a child wearing a virtual reality headset.
** &quot;The Angel and the Gambler&quot; shows Eddie with wings standing outside a floating casino, created by Derek Riggs.
** &quot;Futureal&quot;, also by Riggs, depicts Eddie as a statue head with his brain exposed. Alternate covers for these two singles are renders of Eddie as he would appear in &quot;Ed Hunter&quot;.
* Ed Hunter features the version of Eddie used in the game.
* Brave New World originally showed Eddie in a cloud of smoke coming from a burning &quot;Wicker Man&quot; Eddie, artwork created by Derek Riggs, but this design was removed and placed into the album art, wherein his cloud form looms over a futuristic version of London.
** &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; shows Eddie as a Wicker Man, created by Mark Wilkinson.
** &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot; features Eddie at a press conference, also designed by Wilkinson. An alternate cover uses the same Eddie from the &quot;Brave New World&quot; cover.
* Rock in Rio, in both the CD and the DVD, shows Eddie as a cloud similar to the &quot;Brave New World&quot; cover, but looming over the Rock in Rio stage where the band played when the recording was made.
** &quot;Run to the Hills (2002 CD)&quot;, released to fund the nonprofit Clive Burr MS Trust Fund, had on its cover a Ross Halfin picture of Dickinson taken during the Rio concert digitally manipulated to turn him into Eddie.
* BBC Archives, created by Derek Riggs for &quot;Billboard,&quot; originally depicted Eddie destroying Capitol Records (with whom they had just signed) with the pole of a British flag, but the building was changed for the album cover to show him destroying the Broadcasting House instead.
* Beast over Hammersmith shows Eddie planting a British flag in the earth, adapted from The Beast on the Road tour program from 1982, drawn by Derek Riggs.
* Best of the &#x27;B&#x27; Sides depicts Eddie mooning from behind the wheel of a truck with the words &quot;Up the Irons&quot; written across his rear end, illustrated by Mark Wilkinson. Wilkinson also designed the Eddie&#x27;s Archive embossed metal case.
* Edward the Great shows Eddie on a throne in full royal regalia, created by Tom Adams.
* Dance of Death features Eddie as the Grim Reaper, created by David Patchett.

* Somewhere Back in Time shows the cyborg Eddie (from &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;) erupting from the &quot;Powerslave&quot; statue.
* The Final Frontier, drawn by Melvyn Grant, shows Eddie as an Extraterrestrial retrieving a key from a destroyed spaceship full of dead astronauts. The artwork caused confusion among the band&#x27;s fanbase, who claimed it was not Eddie. Melvyn Grant himself has distanced this new monster from previous Eddie incarnations, stating that it &quot;is not Eddie, as such,&quot; although the band members state that it is.
** The &quot;El Dorado&quot; and &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; radio promo covers, featuring Grant&#x27;s new Eddie in a comic book sleeve, were created by Anthony Dry.
* From Fear to Eternity, created by Melvyn Grant, shows three different incarnations: the Wicker Man Eddie from the &quot;Wicker Man&quot; single, the tank-riding Eddie from the &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; album cover and a cross between the &quot;Dance of Death,&quot; &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; and &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; Eddies.
* The Book of Souls was created by Mark Wilkinson. This Eddie draws inspiration from Maya civilisation, wearing facepaint and earspools similar to those of the Mesoamerican people.
* Senjutsu, also created by Mark Wilkinson, depicts Eddie as a samurai from feudal Japan based on an idea from Steve Harris. Samurai Eddie made his first appearance in the animated video for the first single from the album, &quot;The Writing on the Wall,&quot; released four days prior to the announcement of &quot;Senjutsu&quot; on 15 July 2021.

<text>Hammons Field is a minor league baseball stadium located in Springfield, Missouri, with a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating. The facility, funded entirely by local businessman, hotel mogul and benefactor John Q. Hammons, is the centerpiece of the midtown development project, Jordan Valley Park, on the corner of Sherman Avenue and Trafficway Boulevard. Completed in April 2004, it is home to the Springfield Cardinals, the Texas League affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals as well as the Missouri State University Bears.

Hammons built the ballpark before he had a minor league team secured to play in the stadium, though he steadfastly assured local residents it would be the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals. He was ultimately able to persuade the Cardinals to purchase the El Paso Diablos franchise of the Texas League from the Brett Bros. and relocate it to Springfield. They became the Springfield Cardinals soon thereafter when the parent club ended its brief two-year affiliation with the Tennessee Smokies of the Southern League.

In February 2023, the city of Springfield purchased Hammons Field and its surrounding parking lots for $12 million with plans to spend $4 million on stadium improvements.

==Features==
The stadium is unique due to its baseball specific outbuildings. The stadium currently has two large buildings just outside the right-field walls. The larger of the two serves as a fully furnished indoor practice facility complete with astroturf, batting cages, and a small diamond for drills. The smaller building serves as administration, including General Manager offices, as well as housing both home teams&#x27; clubhouses, a cardio workout facility, and the physical trainer&#x27;s office.

The stadium is also furnished with 28 luxury box suites. Only two of the Press Box level suites were initially available for public use; the largest of the three served as a personal suite for John Q. Hammons until his death in 2013 at the age of 94.

Hammons Field also boasts one of the largest high-definition video boards in Minor League Baseball.

==Events==
In 2004, 2007 and 2012, the venue hosted the Missouri Valley Conference baseball tournament.

<doc id="1162678" wikidata="Q415215" url="?curid=1162678" title="Ferredoxin">
<text>Ferredoxins (from Latin &quot;ferrum&quot;: iron + redox, often abbreviated &quot;fd&quot;) are iron–sulfur proteins that mediate electron transfer in a range of metabolic reactions. The term &quot;ferredoxin&quot; was coined by D.C. Wharton of the DuPont Co. and applied to the &quot;iron protein&quot; first purified in 1962 by Mortenson, Valentine, and Carnahan from the anaerobic bacterium &quot;Clostridium pasteurianum&quot;.

Another redox protein, isolated from spinach chloroplasts, was termed &quot;chloroplast ferredoxin&quot;. The chloroplast ferredoxin is involved in both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation reactions of photosynthesis. In non-cyclic photophosphorylation, ferredoxin is the last electron acceptor thus reducing the enzyme NADP+ reductase. It accepts electrons produced from sunlight-excited chlorophyll and transfers them to the enzyme ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase .

Ferredoxins are small proteins containing iron and sulfur atoms organized as iron–sulfur clusters. These biological &quot;capacitors&quot; can accept or discharge electrons, with the effect of a change in the oxidation state of the iron atoms between +2 and +3. In this way, ferredoxin acts as an electron transfer agent in biological redox reactions.

Other bioinorganic electron transport systems include rubredoxins, cytochromes, blue copper proteins, and the structurally related Rieske proteins.

Ferredoxins can be classified according to the nature of their iron–sulfur clusters and by sequence similarity.

== Bioenergetics of ferredoxins ==
Ferredoxins typically carry out a single electron transfer.

: + &lt;chem&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/chem&gt; 

However a few bacterial ferredoxins (of the 2[4Fe4S] type) have two iron sulfur clusters and can carry out two electron transfer reactions. Depending on the sequence of the protein, the two transfers can have nearly identical reduction potentials or they may be significantly different.

: + &lt;chem&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/chem&gt; 

: + &lt;chem&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/chem&gt; 

Ferredoxins are one of the most reducing biological electron carriers. They typically have a mid point potential of -420 mV. The reduction potential of a substance in the cell will differ from its midpoint potential depending on the concentrations of its reduced and oxidized forms. For a one electron reaction, the potential changes by around 60 mV for each power of ten change in the ratio of the concentration. For example, if the ferredoxin pool is around 95% reduced, the reduction potential will be around -500 mV. In comparison, other biological reactions mostly have less reducing potentials: for example the primary biosynthetic reductant of the cell, NADPH has a cellular redox potential of -370 mV ( = -320 mV).

Depending on the sequence of the supporting protein ferredoxins have reduction potential from around -500 mV to -340 mV. A single cell can have multiple types of ferredoxins where each type is tuned to optimally carry out different reactions.

=== Reduction of ferredoxin ===
The highly reducing ferredoxins are reduced either by using another strong reducing agent, or by using some source of energy to &quot;boost&quot; electrons from less reducing sources to the ferredoxin.

==== Direct reduction ====
Reactions that reduce Fd include the oxidation of aldehydes to acids like the glyceraldehyde to glycerate reaction (-580 mV), the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase reaction (-520 mV), and the 2-oxoacid:Fd Oxidoreductase reactions (-500 mV) like the reaction carried out by pyruvate synthase.

==== Membrane potential coupled reduction ====
Ferredoxin can also be reduced by using NADH (-320 mV) or (-414 mV), but these processes are coupled to the consumption of the membrane potential to power the &quot;boosting&quot; of electrons to the higher energy state. The Rnf complex is a widespread membrane protein in bacteria that reversibly transfers electrons between NADH and ferredoxin while pumping or ions across the cell membrane. The chemiosmotic potential of the membrane is consumed to power the unfavorable reduction of by NADH. This reaction is an essential source of in many autotrophic organisms. If the cell is growing on substrates that provide excess , the Rnf complex can transfer these electrons to and store the resultant energy in the membrane potential. The energy converting hydrogenases (Ech) are a family of enzymes that reversibly couple the transfer of electrons between and while pumping ions across the membrane to balance the energy difference.

: + + &lt;chem&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/chem&gt; + + 

: + + &lt;chem&gt;&lt;=&gt;&lt;/chem&gt; + + 

==== Electron bifurcation ====
The unfavourable reduction of Fd from a less reducing electron donor can be coupled simultaneously with the favourable reduction of an oxidizing agent through an electron bifurcation reaction. An example of the electron bifurcation reaction is the generation of for nitrogen fixation in certain aerobic diazotrophs. Typically, in oxidative phosphorylation the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (Q) is coupled to charging the proton motive force. In &quot;Azotobacter&quot; the energy released by transferring one electron from NADH to Q is used to simultaneously boost the transfer of one electron from NADH to Fd.

==== Direct reduction of high potential ferredoxins ====
Some ferredoxins have a sufficiently high redox potential that they can be directly reduced by NADPH. One such ferredoxin is adrenoxin (-274 mV) which takes part in the biosynthesis of many mammalian steroids. The ferredoxin Fd3 in the roots of plants that reduces nitrate and sulfite has a midpoint potential of -337 mV and is also reduced by NADPH.

== Fe2S2 ferredoxins ==
Members of the 2Fe–2S ferredoxin superfamily () have a general core structure consisting of beta(2)-alpha-beta(2), which includes putidaredoxin, terpredoxin, and adrenodoxin. They are proteins of around one hundred amino acids with four conserved cysteine residues to which the 2Fe–2S cluster is ligated. This conserved region is also found as a domain in various metabolic enzymes and in multidomain proteins, such as aldehyde oxidoreductase (&quot;N&quot;-terminal), xanthine oxidase (&quot;N&quot;-terminal), phthalate dioxygenase reductase (&quot;C&quot;-terminal), succinate dehydrogenase iron–sulphur protein (&quot;N&quot;-terminal), and methane monooxygenase reductase (&quot;N&quot;-terminal).

=== Plant-type ferredoxins ===
One group of ferredoxins, originally found in chloroplast membranes, has been termed &quot;chloroplast-type&quot; or &quot;plant-type&quot; (). Its active center is a [Fe2S2] cluster, where the iron atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated both by inorganic sulfur atoms and by sulfurs of four conserved cysteine (Cys) residues.

In chloroplasts, Fe2S2 ferredoxins function as electron carriers in the photosynthetic electron transport chain and as electron donors to various cellular proteins, such as glutamate synthase, nitrite reductase, sulfite reductase, and the cyclase of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Since the cyclase is a ferredoxin dependent enzyme this may provide a mechanism for coordination between photosynthesis and the chloroplasts need for chlorophyll by linking chlorophyll biosynthesis to the photosynthetic electron transport chain. In hydroxylating bacterial dioxygenase systems, they serve as intermediate electron-transfer carriers between reductase flavoproteins and oxygenase.

=== Thioredoxin-like ferredoxins ===
The Fe2S2 ferredoxin from &quot;Clostridium pasteurianum&quot; (&quot;Cp&quot;2FeFd; ) has been recognized as distinct protein family on the basis of its amino acid sequence, spectroscopic properties of its iron–sulfur cluster and the unique ligand swapping ability of two cysteine ligands to the [Fe2S2] cluster. Although the physiological role of this ferredoxin remains unclear, a strong and specific interaction of &quot;Cp&quot;2FeFd with the molybdenum-iron protein of nitrogenase has been revealed. Homologous ferredoxins from &quot;Azotobacter vinelandii&quot; (&quot;Av&quot;2FeFdI; ) and &quot;Aquifex aeolicus&quot; (&quot;Aa&quot;Fd; ) have been characterized. The crystal structure of &quot;Aa&quot;Fd has been solved. &quot;Aa&quot;Fd exists as a dimer. The structure of &quot;Aa&quot;Fd monomer is different from other Fe2S2 ferredoxins. The fold belongs to the α+β class, with first four β-strands and two α-helices adopting a variant of the thioredoxin fold. UniProt categorizes these as the &quot;2Fe2S Shethna-type ferredoxin&quot; family.

=== Adrenodoxin-type ferredoxins ===

Adrenodoxin (adrenal ferredoxin; ), putidaredoxin, and terpredoxin make up a family of soluble Fe2S2 proteins that act as single electron carriers, mainly found in eukaryotic mitochondria and Pseudomonadota. The human variant of adrenodoxin is referred to as ferredoxin-1 and ferredoxin-2. In mitochondrial monooxygenase systems, adrenodoxin transfers an electron from NADPH:adrenodoxin reductase to membrane-bound cytochrome P450. In bacteria, putidaredoxin and terpredoxin transfer electrons between corresponding NADH-dependent ferredoxin reductases and soluble P450s. The exact functions of other members of this family are not known, although &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; Fdx is shown to be involved in biogenesis of Fe–S clusters. Despite low sequence similarity between adrenodoxin-type and plant-type ferredoxins, the two classes have a similar folding topology.

Ferredoxin-1 in humans participates in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It also transfers electrons from adrenodoxin reductase to CYP11A1, a CYP450 enzyme responsible for cholesterol side chain cleavage. FDX-1 has the capability to bind to metals and proteins. Ferredoxin-2 participates in heme A and iron–sulphur protein synthesis.

== Fe4S4 and Fe3S4 ferredoxins ==

The [Fe4S4] ferredoxins may be further subdivided into low-potential (bacterial-type) and high-potential (HiPIP) ferredoxins.

Low- and high-potential ferredoxins are related by the following redox scheme:

The formal oxidation numbers of the iron ions can be [2Fe3+, 2Fe2+] or [1Fe3+, 3Fe2+] in low-potential ferredoxins. The oxidation numbers of the iron ions in high-potential ferredoxins can be [3Fe3+, 1Fe2+] or [2Fe3+, 2Fe2+].

=== Bacterial-type ferredoxins ===
A group of Fe4S4 ferredoxins, originally found in bacteria, has been termed &quot;bacterial-type&quot;. Bacterial-type ferredoxins may in turn be subdivided into further groups, based on their sequence properties. Most contain at least one conserved domain, including four cysteine residues that bind to a [Fe4S4] cluster. In &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot; Fe4S4 ferredoxin, one of the conserved Cys residues is substituted with aspartic acid.

During the evolution of bacterial-type ferredoxins, intrasequence gene duplication, transposition and fusion events occurred, resulting in the appearance of proteins with multiple iron–sulfur centers. In some bacterial ferredoxins, one of the duplicated domains has lost one or more of the four conserved Cys residues. These domains have either lost their iron–sulfur binding property or bind to a [Fe3S4] cluster instead of a [Fe4S4] cluster and dicluster-type.

3-D structures are known for a number of monocluster and dicluster bacterial-type ferredoxins. The fold belongs to the α+β class, with 2-7 α-helices and four β-strands forming a barrel-like structure, and an extruded loop containing three &quot;proximal&quot; Cys ligands of the iron–sulfur cluster.

=== High-potential iron–sulfur proteins ===
High potential iron–sulfur proteins (HiPIPs) form a unique family of Fe4S4 ferredoxins that function in anaerobic electron transport chains. Some HiPIPs have a redox potential higher than any other known iron–sulfur protein (e.g., HiPIP from &quot;Rhodopila globiformis&quot; has a redox potential of ca. -450 mV). Several HiPIPs have so far been characterized structurally, their folds belonging to the α+β class. As in other bacterial ferredoxins, the [Fe4S4] unit forms a cubane-type cluster and is ligated to the protein &quot;via&quot; four Cys residues.

<doc id="1162681" wikidata="Q5266819" url="?curid=1162681" title="Developmental roster">
<text>In Major League Soccer, in addition to the senior roster, each team can carry a developmental roster of a certain number of young players whose contracts do not count against the salary cap. The allowable size of developmental rosters has varied throughout its existence: in the 2005 season, it grew to ten from a former limit of six, but for the 2009 season, it was reduced to a limit of four players.

The developmental roster includes Generation adidas (known as &quot;Project-40&quot; before 2005) signees, Home-Grown Players, and other players (usually recent college graduates) 25 or younger, called developmental players. Except for the Generation adidas players, whose salaries have no limit and are negotiated individually with the league, developmental players are paid a salary well below the MLS minimum, currently pegged at around $32,504 per year. A player is graduated from the developmental roster to the senior roster at the team&#x27;s discretion, a decision which usually results from a player passing the age limit or becoming an important member of the squad.

Notable former developmental players include: Davy Arnaud, Nat Borchers, Alejandro Moreno, Jack Jewsbury, Chris Wondolowski and Troy Perkins.

The bill was passed on March 30, 2011.

On October 14, 2010, Martiniuk announced his decision not to run in 2011 election.

<doc id="1162683" wikidata="Q156434" url="?curid=1162683" title="Petri Pasanen">
<text>Petri Pasanen (born 24 September 1980) is a Finnish football coach, TV studio presenter and a former professional footballer who played as a defender. He was most comfortable as centre-back, but also played right-back and left-back as well. Pasanen began his senior career in his native Finland before moving to Ajax. He spent most of his career at Bundesliga club Werder Bremen which he represented in the UEFA Champions League in multiple seasons, and in the 2009 UEFA Cup Final. At international level, he made 76 appearances for the Finland national team scoring one goal.

==Club career==
===FC Lahti===
Born in Lahti, Finland, Pasanen became a regular for local club FC Lahti during the club&#x27;s promotion season in 1998. During the next two seasons he made 42 appearances for the club in Finland&#x27;s Veikkausliiga.

===Ajax===
Many of Europe&#x27;s top clubs had become interested in the promising Pasanen, and in the summer of 2000 he joined Dutch club Ajax. The transfer fee was not disclosed, but is believed to be around 6 million Finnish markka, which corresponds roughly to €1 million. He became a regular in the Ajax defense in his first season, but his progress was halted when he broke his foot in August 2001, and had to miss most of the 2001–02 season. Next season he was a regular again as Ajax reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League.

He fell out of favour at Ajax in 2003–04, and spent the second half of the season on loan at English club Portsmouth in the Premier League. Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp was interested in purchasing Pasanen at the end of the season, but claimed Ajax&#x27;s asking price was too high.

===Werder Bremen===
Pasanen was then signed by reigning German champions Werder Bremen in the summer of 2004. He became a key player for the club, helping them to a top three finish in the Bundesliga and the second round of the Champions League in each of his first two seasons at the club. Whilst at Bremen he played in the 2009 UEFA Cup Final.

===Red Bull Salzburg===
On 30 June 2011, after the end of his contract, he left Werder Bremen, and signed for Red Bull Salzburg. On 12 May 2012, Salzburg announced that they would not renew Pasanen&#x27;s contract and he would be free to look for a new club during the summer.

===AGF Aarhus===
On 28 July 2012, Pasanen signed a two-year contract with Danish topflight side AGF. He scored his first goal for AGF on 10 December 2012, in a 3−3 home draw against Silkeborg.

===Return to Lahti===
In May 2014, FC Lahti announced that Pasanen would return to Lahti and that he had signed a contract until the end of the 2016 season. On 29 September 2015, Pasanen announced that he would retire from professional football at the end of the season.

==International career==
Pasanen was also a regular for the Finland national team. He made his international debut on 15 November 2000 against the Republic of Ireland. Pasanen has mostly played at right back for Finland, and has also served as the national team&#x27;s captain, when Sami Hyypiä and Jari Litmanen have not played. He scored his only goal on 22 May 2002 in a home friendly at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium against Latvia, which Finland won 2–1.

Pasanen has also played in Finland national futsal team, where he has six caps and two goals.

==Coaching career==
After his playing career, Pasanen has worked as a youth coach for FC Lahti, and as an assistant coach of the club&#x27;s first team during 2022–2023.

==Later career==
After his professional career, Pasanen has worked as a football pundit for Yle in 2014–2018, and for MTV Oy in 2018–2020. Since 2020, Pasanen has worked for MTV and C More Finland as a football studio host in UEFA Champions League matches and international tournaments. In May 2023, Pasanen worked as a studio host in 2023 IIHF Ice Hockey World Championship tournament.

==Personal life==
His son Samuel Pasanen is also a professional footballer, playing for FC Lahti in Veikkausliiga.

<text>The Children&#x27;s Museum of Bogotá (Fundación Museo de los Niños) was a privately managed museum foundation in Bogotá, Colombia&#x27;s capital city, founded in 1986 and opened to the public in 1987. It aimed at teaching children about science, technology, culture and arts. The foundation operated the Children&#x27;s Museum in an 8,000 m2 (86,000 ft.²) building in the geographical centre of Bogotá, in which over 23 different modules and hundreds of individual exhibits were housed. The museum served approximately 150,000 visitors per year — 69% of them children under 11 years of age that come to &quot;learn by playing&quot; in the exhibits.

In addition to guided tours, the Children&#x27;s Museum conducted workshops, special vacation programs for children and highly structured events for schools.

== Programs and attractions ==
To celebrate its 15th anniversary, the museum invited the most important young Colombian artists to paint a mural on the museum walls. This resulted in a collection of 42 murals which have become a landmark for art students in Bogotá. Another highly important program of the Museum is the Computer Clubhouse – an international program promoted by the Intel Corporation and the Museum of Science, Boston. Computer Clubhouse teaches children of low-income families computer skills for computer animation, graphic design, composing and editing, as a means to close the digital divide in society. An introduction to robotics is also included in this program.

In the outer gardens of the museum, a real Boeing 720 aircraft (without actual function, fuel, electricity or engines) was present to teach children the basics of aeronautics. The airliner was donated by Avianca (the biggest airline in Colombia) in the mid-1980s.

The museum also featured a room with a small representation of a city&#x27;s roads to teach children traffic signs and behavior while driving or walking on the streets.

== Closure ==
The Museum was returned to the city in November of 2017; it was in poor condition after decades of use and did not conform to modern building standards. It was decided that a new attraction for children would replace the old Museum. In 2018, it became a park for children. Its main attractions are now bouncing houses, bicycle rides, and races for kids.

<doc id="1162701" wikidata="Q281901" url="?curid=1162701" title="Talia al Ghul">
<text>Talia al Ghul (; , ) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman. The character was created by writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Bob Brown, and first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #411 (May 1971).

Talia is most commonly known as being the daughter of the supervillain Ra&#x27;s al Ghul as well as the on-and-off lover of the superhero Batman and the mother of their son Damian Wayne (the fifth Robin). The circumstances of Damian&#x27;s conception have varied over the years, with the original story behind his conception being the result of a brief marriage between Bruce and Talia in the &quot;Elseworlds&quot; story &quot;Birth of the Demon&quot;, the second explanation being a result of a sexual assault of Bruce by Talia as seen in Grant Morrison’s works. Over the years, she has alternately been depicted as an anti-heroine who is constantly torn between being an ally and an enemy of Batman due to her loyalty to both him and her environmentalist father, with whom she shares the same vision when it comes to saving the planet and nature, but not the means he uses to achieve that goal.

Talia has been featured in various media adaptations. The character was voiced by Helen Slater and Olivia Hussey in the DC Animated Universe, which became her first appearances in media other than comic books. The character was subsequently portrayed by Marion Cotillard in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; and by Lexa Doig in the Arrowverse television series &quot;Arrow&quot;.

==Publication history==

The character was created by the writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Bob Brown as simply Talia originally. The character&#x27;s creation and depiction was inspired by other works of fiction, such as the 1969 James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, and the Fu Manchu fiction. The character first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #411 (May 1971). She is most commonly depicted as a romantic interest for Batman, a villain, or a combination of the two. Her father, the leader of a worldwide criminal and terrorist empire, considered Batman the man most worthy to marry Talia and become his successor. Absent a spouse, Talia was considered as an heir to her father and his organization. While Batman is uninterested in the criminal empire, he has often demonstrated romantic feelings for Talia.

Talia has saved the life of Batman or helped him on numerous occasions. The majority of her criminal acts have been committed at the behest of her father and motivated by loyalty to her father rather than for personal gain. She had been depicted as morally ambiguous or an antiheroic figure. In the mid to late 1990s part of her father&#x27;s name was incorporated to hers as a kind of surname to help readers associate her with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. Recent depictions have shown her to be more often an enemy of Batman and a supervillain in her own right, such as leading the League of Assassins, as part of the Secret Society of Super Villains, and as the mastermind behind Leviathan.

IGN&#x27;s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time List ranked Talia as #42. She was ranked 25th in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Sexiest Women in Comics&quot; list.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early years===
The first Talia comic story appears in &quot;Into the Den of the Death-Dealers!&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #411 (May 1971), written by Dennis O&#x27;Neil. In the story, Batman rescues her from Dr. Darrk, apparently the leader of the League of Assassins. It is eventually revealed that the League is just one part of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s organization, The Demon, and that Darrk apparently turned against Ra&#x27;s after failing in a mission (the usual punishment for this is death). At the end of the story, she shoots and kills Darrk to save Batman&#x27;s life.
Talia next appears in &quot;Daughter of the Demon&quot; in &quot;Batman&quot; #232 (June 1971). In the story, Dick Grayson (Robin) is kidnapped. Ra&#x27;s al Ghul enters the Batcave, revealing to Batman that he knows Batman&#x27;s secret identity and saying that Talia was also kidnapped along with Dick. Batman then goes with Ra&#x27;s to search for Dick and Talia; in the end, it is revealed that Talia loves Batman and that the entire kidnapping is a setup designed by Ra&#x27;s as a final test of Batman&#x27;s suitability to be Talia&#x27;s husband and his successor. Though Batman rejects Ra&#x27;s offer, he nevertheless returns Talia&#x27;s feelings. Ra&#x27;s and Talia consider Batman to be married to Talia with only their consent necessary in &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #15 (1978) in the story &quot;I Now Pronounce You Batman and Wife!&quot;.

In the years since the character met Batman, Talia is repeatedly depicted as torn between her love for the Caped Crusader and her loyalty to her father. However, she has proven an important ally in her way; most prominently, she encourages Batman to return to Gotham City when it is declared a &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1999) following an earthquake.

===&quot;Son of the Demon&quot;===
In the graphic novel &quot;&quot; (1987) by Mike W. Barr, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul successfully enlists Batman&#x27;s aid in defeating a rogue assassin who had murdered his wife and Talia&#x27;s mother, Melisande. Talia witnessed the murder as a young child. During this storyline, Batman marries Talia and the prior marriage from &quot;DC Special Series&quot; #15 (1978) is referenced. They have sex which results in her becoming pregnant. Batman is nearly killed protecting Talia from an attack by the assassin&#x27;s agents. In retrospect, Talia concludes that she could never keep Batman, as he would be continuously forced to defend her, so she fakes a miscarriage, and the marriage is dissolved.

In later continuity, after Talia gives birth the child is left at an orphanage. He is adopted and given the name &quot;Ibn al Xu&#x27;ffasch&quot; which is Arabic for &#x27;son of the bat&#x27;. The only other clue to the child&#x27;s heritage is a jewel-encrusted necklace Batman had given to Talia which Talia leaves with the child.

It is referenced in three Elseworlds storylines: &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, its sequel &quot;The Kingdom,&quot; and &quot;Brotherhood of the Bat&quot; feature two alternate versions of the child as an adult, coming to terms with his dual heritage.

===&quot;Birth of the Demon&quot;===
The graphic novel &quot;Batman: Birth of the Demon&quot; (1992) by Dennis O&#x27;Neil explains how her father met her mother at Woodstock, New York. Talia&#x27;s mother is confirmed deceased of a drug overdose in this story. This introduction of Talia&#x27;s mother in particular, (as well as Talia al Ghul&#x27;s origin) is revised and further elaborated in &quot;Batman, Incorporated&quot; #2 (2012) by Grant Morrison and Chris Burnham.

===Bane===

After Bane enters the League of Assassins, Ra&#x27;s considers Bane a potential heir to his empire instead of Batman and wants his daughter to marry him. Talia later rejects the brute, regarding him as merely a cunning animal compared to the more cultured intelligence of his predecessor. After Batman defeats Bane in the &quot;&quot; comic series (1996), Ra&#x27;s agrees that Bane was unworthy of his daughter (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #701 and &quot;Robin&quot; #33), and calls off their engagement. Following &quot;Legacy&quot;, Bane has a nightmare in &quot;Batman: Bane&quot; (1997) of Talia (presumed to be deceased) betraying him and stabbing him and then embracing Batman. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #26 (2001), written by Dixon, Bane continues to express his obsession with Talia. At the end of the story, Talia is pleased with the supposed death of Bane in one of her father&#x27;s underground sanctums.

===LexCorp===
The Talia character was written to begin a new phase of her fictional life near the turn of the century. Talia, disillusioned with her father and his plans and using the name Talia Head for herself, leaves him to run LexCorp as its new CEO when Lex Luthor becomes President of the United States. Although she seemingly supports Luthor, she secretly works to undermine him, anonymously leaking news of his underhanded dealings to Superman. In &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #6 (March 2004), when the time comes for Luthor&#x27;s downfall, she sells all of LexCorp&#x27;s assets to the Wayne Foundation, leaving Luthor penniless and his crimes exposed to all.

===&quot;Death and the Maidens&quot;===
In &quot;Batman: Death and the Maidens&quot; (2003) written by Greg Rucka, it is revealed that Ra&#x27;s al Ghul met a woman by whom he had a daughter named Nyssa during his travels in Russia in the 20th century. Ra&#x27;s abandons Nyssa at a crucial time: she is tortured, her entire family is killed in a concentration camp during the Holocaust, and she is rendered sterile when Nazi doctors pour acid into her uterus. Seeking vengeance, Nyssa plans to use her considerable wealth and resources to kill Ra&#x27;s by befriending, kidnapping, and brainwashing Talia, turning her into a weapon to kill their father. To this end, she captures Talia and kills and resurrects her in rapid succession in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Talia virtually broken from the trauma of dying again and again in so short a time as Nyssa asks Talia why her father is &#x27;letting&#x27; this happen to her. Rendered apathetic by her time in the camp, unable to feel anything, Nyssa also plans to assassinate Superman with Kryptonite bullets she stole from the Batcave, hoping that, by uniting the world in one moment of tragedy, she would manage to rouse herself once more.

While Batman is successful in preventing the assassination of Superman, he is unable to stop Nyssa from killing Ra&#x27;s. This, in turn, is actually part of a greater plan concocted by Ra&#x27;s, who wants to ensure that his daughters would accept their destinies as his heirs and take up his genocidal campaign. Realizing and accepting this, Nyssa and Talia become the heads of The Demon, with Talia disavowing her love for Bruce Wayne as another result of her torture at Nyssa&#x27;s hands (both sisters then consider Batman to be their enemy). Talia from then on became more often Batman&#x27;s enemy than an ally.

===The Society===
In &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;, it is revealed that Talia is one of the core members of the Secret Society of Super Villains (the others were Lex Luthor (secretly Alexander Luthor, Jr. in disguise), Black Adam, Doctor Psycho, Deathstroke, and Calculator). This is revealed to be part of one of half-sister Nyssa&#x27;s plans to take over the planet and bring about world peace and equality. After Nyssa is killed by Batgirl Cassandra Cain, Talia assumes leadership of the League.

===&quot;Under the Hood&quot; and &quot;Red Hood: The Lost Days&quot;===

During the &quot;&quot; (1988) storyline, Jason Todd, the second Robin, is murdered by the Joker in Ethiopia. He was later revived as a character, and in &quot;&quot; (2005), he is discovered by the League of Assassins. In &quot;Lost Days&quot;, out of her love for Batman, Talia takes Jason to her father and Jason spends months in the care of the League of Assassins. Although his body recuperates, Jason&#x27;s mind is shattered.

Seeing no other way to help him, Talia takes Jason down to the Lazarus Pit and throws his body in while her father regenerates himself. Jason is fully revived in the body and mind. Immediately afterward, to spare Jason her father&#x27;s wrath, she aids the boy&#x27;s escape.

Livid at the fact that Batman failed to avenge his (Jason&#x27;s) death by killing the Joker and that Batman had done nothing more than imprison him again, Jason pursues his own brand of justice. To stall him from killing Batman, Talia agrees to finance Jason and aid him in his training, so that he can then become the second Red Hood.

In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, this story was changed, whereby &quot;Red Hood and the Outlaws&quot; #2 (2011) shows that, shortly after Jason Todd&#x27;s return from the dead, Talia al Ghul, out of her love for Batman, takes him to a secret cult of warrior monks called the All Caste to train in becoming a skilled assassin.

===&quot;Batman and Son&quot;===

The concept of Talia and Batman having a child from &quot;Son of the Demon&quot; is reinterpreted into continuity in the story &quot;Batman and Son&quot; (2006), written by Grant Morrison. Their son is grown in an artificial womb and named Damian. He is raised and trained in the League of Assassins. Talia introduces him to Batman as part of a grand scheme involving ninja Man-Bats and the kidnapping of the British Prime Minister&#x27;s wife.

===&quot;R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;===
During the &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; storyline, Talia and Damian become aware of the Black Glove&#x27;s plot against Batman and begin devising a plan to help save him. They arrive at Wayne Manor just in time to save Commissioner James Gordon from being killed by assorted booby traps created by the Black Glove. This is referenced in issue 39 of the old 52. She offers to join forces with Gordon to save Batman. She and Gordon arrive too late, however, and are informed by Robin that Batman went missing and maybe dead following a battle with Doctor Hurt.

Furious that her love may be dead, she sends out her ninja Man-Bats to murder Jezebel Jet, who plays a major role in trying to kill Batman. Soon after it is revealed Batman did not die, but survives only to be captured by Darkseid during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; and then apparently murdered by the New God.

Following Batman&#x27;s apparent death, Talia apparently decides to leave Damian in the hands of his adoptive brother Dick Grayson, who later takes on the role of Batman, and selects Damian to succeed Tim Drake as Robin.

In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, she is placed on the new Society&#x27;s inner circle by Libra. Despite Talia&#x27;s interaction with the new Society she still behaves lovingly and almost devoted to Batman.

It is revealed in &quot;Gotham City Sirens&quot; #2 that Talia has trained Selina Kyle to resist even the most intense psychological coercion to reveal Bruce Wayne&#x27;s secret identity.

Following an operation in which Damian&#x27;s spine is replaced, it is revealed that Talia inserts an implant into his spine that allows her or anyone she chooses, including Deathstroke, to control Damian&#x27;s body remotely. She intends to use this device to force Damian to kill Dick Grayson, whom she perceives as holding her son back from his potential. After Grayson frees Damian, Talia reveals to her son that she has begun cloning him after realizing that the Boy Wonder has completely sided with his father&#x27;s circle during their confrontation. She is too much of a perfectionist to love her son after he has defied her in such a manner, and is no longer welcome in the House of al Ghul.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. In &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot;, written by Grant Morrison, Talia is revealed to be the mastermind behind the Leviathan, a shadowy organization formed to oppose Bruce&#x27;s &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; project. She places a bounty of US$500 million on Damian&#x27;s head, and declares war on Batman. In &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; Vol. 2, #2 (2012), a Talia origin issue, she puts her father, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, under house arrest for opposing her plan and takes his men away with her. She claims to Batman that her agents have infiltrated all of Gotham&#x27;s infrastructure and that she is providing the poor with purpose by arming them and giving them slogans to chant, as well as an enemy to fight. Talia says Batman must choose between saving Gotham from suicide or saving their son Damian from a death sentence. Her clone of Damian, known as the Heretic, stabs Damian through the chest and delivers the killing stroke to her son, leaving Batman devastated.

After the Heretic loses his final confrontation with Batman, Talia kills him, destroys Wayne Tower, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave. There, Talia poisons Batman. He embraces and kisses her mid-battle, not knowing that her lips were covered with poison, and he apologizes for not being able to love her the way she wants and admits defeat. Talia asks Batman to beg for the antidote but he does not respond. Jason Todd arrives at the Batcave and offers Talia the Oroboro trigger, a device that would trigger the destruction of seven cities and that she claims would provide a new source of energy for the world. When she attempts to activate the device, Jason reveals that he has double-crossed her and that the weapons the device would trigger had already been disarmed. Talia is then shot and killed by Spyral agent Kathy Kane, buried, and her body later disappears from the gravesite along with that of Damian.

Morrison&#x27;s writing of the Batman, Talia, and Damian saga drew from their own personal experience as a child of divorce. The end of &quot;Batman Incorporated&quot; marked the end of his seven-year run on the characters.

While Batman was preoccupied with a series of cases, Talia&#x27;s body is taken from the grave by her father, Ra&#x27;s, so that he may resurrect his daughter and his grandson, Damian, whose body was also taken. Batman continues his pursuit for Ra&#x27;s and to reclaim his son&#x27;s body. Ra&#x27;s attempted to resurrect Talia alongside Damian in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island of Themyscira, but instead Ra&#x27;s discovered that it was a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit&#x27;s former location, which both Wonder Woman and Batman already knew. Ra&#x27;s flees with the bodies afterwards. Batman arrives too late, after Ra&#x27;s has successfully had the bodies placed in a Lazarus Pit. The resurrections fail, leaving Ra&#x27;s to realize his arrogance in allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret for allowing Talia to clone Damian.

After defeating Ra&#x27;s in combat, as Batman intends to reclaim his son&#x27;s body, their battle is disrupted by Darkseid&#x27;s elite member Glorious Godfrey, as well as a number of Parademons. Batman is forced to team up with Ra&#x27;s to battle Godfrey (who came to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid, which Ra&#x27;s had hidden in Damian&#x27;s body) and the Parademons who had taken the bodies of Talia and Damian. Ra&#x27;s manages to get his daughter&#x27;s body from the Parademons in the sky, but falls into the gorge of Nanda Parbat along with Talia&#x27;s body, while Batman tries to retrieve his son&#x27;s body from Godfrey.

Following Damian&#x27;s resurrection, Talia had emerged on Nanda Parbat with no memory of who she was. She kills a nearby Tibetan to eat their food.

Later, Talia was approached by a shadowy figure; she is able to recognize the robed figure and feared that a faction known as the Lu&#x27;un Darga is upon release, she is then knocked unconscious. The robed figure restores Talia&#x27;s memory and attempts to influence her as a servant, but Talia resists his control and knocks him unconscious with stalagmites. She tries to escape the Lu&#x27;un Darga&#x27;s unknown lair of the inner core with the heart of the Lazarus Pit. When Talia was reunited with her son in the Lu&#x27;un Darga&#x27;s lair on al Ghul Island, Damian is aware of his quest about the Lu&#x27;un Darga. He doesn&#x27;t wish to see Talia however and attacks her.

During their battle, Talia tries, unsuccessfully, to convince Damian that Ra&#x27;s and his al Ghul family wage war against the ancient immortals of the Lu&#x27;un Darga, claiming to be guardians of the Lazarus Pit. While Ra&#x27;s sought to bring power and balance of life to Earth, the Lu&#x27;un Darga then tried to take back all life and cleanse Earth entirely, because they would bring their own destruction to Earth and the heart of the Lazarus Pit. Talia also tells him he is being used as a pawn by Ra&#x27;s to steal the Lu&#x27;un Darga&#x27;s power. The mysterious robed figure was revealed to be Den Darga, who thanked Damian for inadvertently bringing the relic and attempts to bring about the end of life on Earth.

While Den Darga destroys al Ghul Island by sinking it, he attempts to cleanse Talia and Damian&#x27;s souls. However, his clones protect Damian and sacrifice themselves to save his life. Den Darga flees, leaving Talia and Damian to the abyss; where they were rescued by Damian&#x27;s friends. Afterward, Talia is hopeful that she and Damian can move to a safe place and tells her unconscious son to rest. When Damian wakes, Talia convinces her son to calm down. She explains that she had been finding redemption for herself, for her retribution against him and inaction after Den Darga&#x27;s attack. She informs him that if he chooses vigilantism, it will corrupt him. Talia goes on to say that he, too, can choose between staying or leaving, after accepting who he is, except that his mother has been reforming herself and regrets her choices. As he chooses to leave and says goodbye to his mother, Talia rejoins the League of Assassins to prepare for war against Den Darga and the Lu&#x27;un Darga.

Talia, along with Batman, show up again later in the title to aid their son in saving all life on Earth from the threat of Den and the Lu&#x27;un Darga. They are portrayed as a bickering couple but also put things aside to help. Their mission is a success though Damian ends up giving his life to save humanity. He is later brought back to life by Suren Darga. With the world saved, and satisfied her son is safe, she goes to rejoin the League of Assassins.

===DC Rebirth===
During &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, Talia al Ghul shows up for her son, Damian Wayne&#x27;s birthday and warns him of Ra&#x27;s al Ghul plot to send the Demon&#x27;s Fist against Damian and the Teen Titans in a plan to assassinate them to prove their worth to the Demon&#x27;s Head. These targets will later become Damian&#x27;s Teen Titans teammates after he saves them and makes them aware of the Fist and their plans.

==== Shadow War ====
After observing how happy both of his daughter and grandson are while living a peaceful life without killing, the now reformed Ra&#x27;s al Ghul decides that he wants to turn himself in to the authority to atone for all the crimes he committed as well as publicly share all the secrets he kept hidden over the centuries, this decision has sparked a huge interest in both the superhero community and the villain community due the amount of knowledge the immortal Demon&#x27;s Head has about the world, so all eyes were on him during a press conference he held before his incarceration. However, as soon as the conference started, Ra&#x27;s was immediately shot by a sniper wearing a Deathstroke-looking costume, who also threw a bomb that turned his body to ashes to insure that there would be nothing left of him that can be resurrected through the Lazarus Pit.

This incident has deeply hurt both Damian and his mother, Talia, who had to watch her father get murdered even though he finally made the right choice for the first time in his life and was willing to turn a new leaf for his family&#x27;s sake. In her grief, she gathered all the members of the League of Assassins and put a hit on Deathstroke as well as all of his associates in revenge for killing her father. On the other hand, Damian has teamed-up with his father, who wasn&#x27;t fully convinced that it was the real Deathstroke that killed Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, to investigate the murder and find out who was really behind it.

This event concludes with a war between The League of Assassins and Deathstroke Inc, which ends with Talia killing Slade in a one-on-one battle, but shortly afterward the Deathstroke imposter reveals himself to be Geo-Force, who plotted this whole war in hope of having both Slade and Talia killing each other. Damian and Bruce arrive shortly soon and help Talia defeat Geo-Force, with Damian managing to convince his mother to not kill Geo-Force afterward because his grandfather believed that their family could be better than this.

==Powers and abilities==
Talia has been written to be an athlete at the peak of physical conditioning and has been trained in many forms of martial arts. Often underestimated, Talia is an excellent hand-to-hand fighter and is also quite proficient with most hand weapons. 

She was educated in the arts and sciences, and she holds advanced degrees in biology, engineering, and business as an MBA.

==Other versions==
In &quot;Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat&quot;, Earth has been decimated by a plague unleashed by Ra&#x27;s a decade or so before, prompting Ra&#x27;s to claim Wayne Manor as his new base of operations; at this point, Bruce Wayne has been dead for some time under undisclosed circumstances, but Talia has been raising his son Tallant in secret. As Ra&#x27;s transforms a group of his elite assassins into a &#x27;Brotherhood of the Bat&#x27;, using Batman&#x27;s discarded costume designs to create a group of different Batmen, Talia decides that the time has come to tell Tallant of his father&#x27;s heritage, with Tallant infiltrating the Brotherhood to dismantle it from within.

In &quot;Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&quot;, Talia is present when Bruce Wayne enters a Lazarus Pit with her father in 1979; when two men enter the Pit simultaneously, one will perish while the other will become permanently immortal with no way to determine which will be the sacrifice. When Bruce Wayne emerges restored to full youth, he spends the next two decades turning the League of Assassin&#x27;s front organizations into the true operation with Talia at his side, although the exact nature of their relationship is never explicitly confirmed.

In &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest&quot;, when Ra&#x27;s and the League are searching for the lost city of Argos, they come into contact with another group of explorers; impoverished archaeologist Bruce Wayne, reporter Clark Kent, Kent&#x27;s childhood friend Lana Lang, and newspaper-boy Jimmy Olsen. Witnessing Kent&#x27;s exceptional strength, Ra&#x27;s offers him Talia&#x27;s hand in marriage, but although Kent is tempted by the offer, he chooses to escape with his friends to continue their search for Lana&#x27;s abducted father. Later, after Ra&#x27;s is killed when he attempts to claim the power of Argos for himself and Kent is left mortally wounded in a confrontation with Lex Luthor, Talia is able to use her father&#x27;s Lazarus formula to restore Kent to life, expressing grief that she would never have the chance to see how their relationship would develop if this fails. The story concludes with an elderly Lana talking to a young woman named Kara, who is clearly intended to be the child of Clark Kent and Talia al Ghul.

In &quot;&quot;, Talia is sent by her father to corrupt Gotham on route to luring Batman to their master Iog-Sothra, before being killed by the monster.

The character first appeared in &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Keith Giffen. He starred in his own four-issue mini series and has been a regular character in the Iron Man comics as well as at one point being a member of the Avengers.

Jack of Hearts, real name Jack Hart, is the son of scientist Philip Hart (creator of &quot;Zero Fluid&quot;) and an alien woman from the Contraxian race. As a young man Jack was doused in Zero Fluid and gained super powers but was not in total control of his powers. In an attempt to control his powers, Jack of Hearts built a containment suit that resembled the Jack of Hearts playing card. The lack of control became a recurring theme with Jack of Hearts, including his stint in the Avengers where he had to spend 14 hours a day in a containment room to prevent self-destruction. When his powers became uncontrollable he chose to leave Earth, exploding in space without harming any innocent bystanders.

The return of Jack of Hearts and the explosion that killed Scott Lang was the launching point of the 2004-05 &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot;. The character was resurrected as part of one of the Marvel Zombies mini-series where Zero Energy reforms into Jack of Hearts, bringing the character back to life. The Zombies were later defeated with the help of Jack of Hearts.

==Publication history==
Jack of Hearts first appeared in the black &amp; white magazine &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; #22 (March 1976), and was created by writer Bill Mantlo and illustrator Keith Giffen. He was presented as an antagonist for the superhero White Tiger but his origin story in the following issue established him as a hero. His debut appearance in a color comic book was in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2 #214 (Aug. 1977) where he fights the Hulk. He later serves a brief stint as an ally and apprentice of Iron Man, becoming a regular cast member of the series during Mantlo&#x27;s tenure as writer.

Jack has made various guest appearances in several books over the years, including &quot;Marvel Two-In-One&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot;, (in a solo story meant to launch the character in his own series) &quot;ROM&quot;, and &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, (which served as an intro to his 1984 mini-series) among others. He starred in his own self-titled, four issue limited series from Jan. to April 1984.

He was later made a regular in &quot;The Avengers&quot; by writer Kurt Busiek, who explained, &quot;I first ran into Jack in &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot; in an issue drawn by Gil Kane and Rico Rival. That great overcomplicated costume and the energy that Gil put into the storytelling hooked me, and I’ve been a fan ever since&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==

===Early life===
Jack Hart was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the son of Philip Hart, a scientist who created an energy source called &quot;zero fluid&quot;, and Marie, an alien humanoid woman of the Contraxian race. After being exposed to a vat of zero fluid, Jack underwent a mutagenic change and gained the ability to project concussive energy from his body. After gaining these powers, Jack began his mission of vengeance against the Corporation that killed his father. This led to Jack fighting other superheroes such as the Sons of the Tiger and the Hulk. He also fought the White Tiger. Eventually, he killed Stryke, his father&#x27;s killer.

Later, Jack mistakenly fought Iron Man. Being new to super-heroics, he asked Iron Man to take him on as an apprentice, which he did, to show him the ropes. Jack teamed with Iron Man, Nick Fury, Guardsman, Jasper Sitwell, Jean DeWolff, and the Wraith, and battled Midas. Jack was briefly turned to a golden living statue by Midas, and then freed from this golden state by Iron Man and Yellowjacket. Jack then aided Iron Man in fighting the Soviet Super-Soldiers on the moon. Jack aided Iron Man against the Rigellian Commander Arcturus. Jack later went off on his own, and fought Hemlock.

===Being a Hero===
Later, Jack moved past his mission of blind vengeance and became a true hero, working with various other superheroes such as the Defenders. Jack fought the Thing, who was under mental control of the Machinesmith. Jack Hart was then reunited with a college girlfriend named Marcy Kane (who was also a fellow graduate student of Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man). Marcy, a scientist, and S.H.I.E.L.D. offered to help find a cure for Jack&#x27;s dangerous super powers. Jack fought some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, and his powers were temporarily dampened by Spider-Man. Marcy turned out to be a Contraxian agent sent to Earth to find Jack. It was at this time Jack learned of his half-Contraxian heritage. Marcy took Jack to Contraxia, where he discovered that his powers had become much stronger, and saved the home-world of his mother by reenergizing its dying sun. The Contraxians could not find a solution for Jack&#x27;s unstable powers, and he left Contraxia to wander outer space in exile.

While wandering space he was captured by the Stranger. He later escaped captivity on the Stranger&#x27;s planet. Jack fought Quasar during his return to Earth; however, Jack exploded when his containment suit was breached in battle with the Presence. Jack was retrieved from space, revived and mentally controlled by Moondragon, and he attacked Kismet. The damage to his armor led Jack to seek aid from the Silver Surfer, who found an alien armorer on Anvil who designed a new containment suit for Jack. Jack then battled Nebula and Geatar. Shortly after this adventure, Jack fell in love with the alien warrior woman known as Ganymede, though she did not return his feelings.

In an effort to save R-76, an outpost manned by the Rigellians, Jack of Hearts was injured in battle with the Servitors. Jack was rescued by a team of Avengers, and succeeded in convincing the Infinites to restore R-76. Subsequently, Jack and these Avengers were captured, first by the Shi&#x27;Ar, and then by the Ruul acting under the orders of the Supreme Intelligence. Jack and the Avengers eventually escaped to Earth and helped reverse a plan to have Earth consumed by Ego the Living Planet.

Jack&#x27;s return to Earth happened during the period known as the Kang War, and Jack of Hearts was accepted as a member of the Avengers, becoming the fifty-second superhero to join the team, though the traditional welcoming ceremony for new Avengers were deferred given the nature of the crisis they faced. During his tenure, the Avengers teamed-up with the Justice League of America, and fought the Red Skull for unleashing a biological weapon at Mount Rushmore, killing many civilians.

===Death===
When his power levels began to increase beyond the capacity for his containment suit, Jack of Hearts chose to commit suicide rather than continue living in an isolated containment room for 14 hours a day. Jack took a child murderer who had abducted Cassandra Lang, the daughter of Scott Lang (the second Ant-Man), along with him when he exploded in space. With his uniform destroyed in the blast, the naked body of Jack of Hearts drifted deeper into space.

===Avengers Disassembled===
At the onset of the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; event, Jack reappeared in uniform as what appeared to be a zombie just long enough to blow himself up, killing Scott Lang and destroying half of the Avengers Mansion. Jack&#x27;s return was caused by the reality-shifting powers of the Scarlet Witch through methods that have remained ambiguous. Unlike his prior explosion in space, Jack&#x27;s body was never recovered from the ruins.

===Afterlife===
During the adventures of Hercules in Hades, Jack can be seen playing slots to win a chance to return to the living. This is not the intended way the afterlife should operate, according to the characters. Jack wins, and excitedly declares that he is next for resurrection.

===The Children&#x27;s Crusade===
Iron Lad (the young Kang the Conqueror) transports the Young Avengers and the amnesiac Wanda, no longer the Scarlet Witch, back to the onset of the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; when Jack had been used as a weapon to destroy the Avengers. While there they discovered that he was actually the real Jack of Hearts, summoned by Scarlet Witch. Undead and quite miserable, Jack pleads with Wanda not to go through with her monstrous plan, unaware that he is facing a different Wanda. The pity of this and the horror of seeing Jack blow himself up, shocks Wanda into recovering her memory—and therefore her powers. As an unexpected side effect, the life of Scott Lang is also saved, as the Young Avengers take Scott back to the future with them when they depart, thus saving his life while preserving the timeline as everyone still &#x27;saw&#x27; him &#x27;die&#x27; in the explosion. Jack&#x27;s last words before exploding were, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;

===&quot;Marvel Zombies Supreme&quot; and resurrection===
Jack Hart returned to life once more in the second issue of the &quot;Marvel Zombies Supreme&quot; mini-series. While defending scientists at Project Pegasus, (which has been besieged by zombiefied clones of the Squadron Supreme) a team of special operatives led by Jill Harper and the superhero known as Battlestar came across a source of zero-point energy which Harper believed could help them stop the zombies. The zero-point energy unexpectedly reformed itself into corporeal form as Jack, who returned to life wearing his original suit for unexplained reasons. Harper managed to revive Jack, who was temporarily amnesiac and fainting from the stress of becoming human again. Although initially weakened, Jack quickly regained control of his powers and assessed the situation. Using his powers, Jack destroyed the zombies and saved Harper&#x27;s life after she became infected with the zombie virus. Afterwards, the two shared a romantic kiss.

Jack Hart was absent for some time, but eventually returned to a more public life when he literally crashed into the apartment of Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk), and found that he was now able to eat, drink, and sleep normally for the first time since his accident. As Jack regained his powers, he and Jen became romantically involved, Jack assisting Jen in the Reckoning War conflict as they aided the Fantastic Four.

==Powers and abilities==
Jack Hart&#x27;s superhuman powers are as a result of the mutagenic effect of his father&#x27;s &quot;Zero Fluid&quot;, combined with the alien genes from his Contraxian mother. He has superhuman stamina and durability. Jack of Hearts also has the ability to generate &quot;zero energy&quot; within his body and project it as concussive force or intense heat or as a propellant to fly. Jack is sometimes unable to exert complete control over his energies, however. For a short time after restarting Contraxia&#x27;s sun, he uncontrollably radiated enough heat to melt one of Contraxia&#x27;s polar ice caps. He can survive unprotected in space. Jack of Hearts&#x27;s brain has incorporated the artificial intelligence of a computerized device called the Scanalyzer, enabling him to think with the speed of a computer and store and retrieve information with a computer-like capacity and efficiency.

The left half of Jack of Hearts&#x27; body has turned purplish-black from direct exposure to &quot;Zero Fluid&quot;. Jack of Hearts&#x27; left eye has an opaque white membrane covering the entire pupil. These mutations were not solely caused by exposure to the &quot;Zero Fluid&quot;, but are actually aspects of his half-Contraxian genetics brought to the fore, as Contraxians naturally have such appearances.

Jack originally wore a suit of armor crafted in medieval Europe. His second suit of armor was designed by Torval, and made from alien materials designed to contain the zero energy his body generates. His original suit of armor was later restored and upgraded by Moondragon after Jack was rescued from space by the Avengers and thus leading to his connection with the team.

Jack is a fair hand-to-hand combatant, has had some S.H.I.E.L.D. combat training, and is a talented poet.

==In other media==
In the &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; TV series, Jack of Hearts is seen as part of Nebula&#x27;s crew.

<doc id="1162713" wikidata="Q823115" url="?curid=1162713" title="Jeep Wagoneer (SJ)">
<text>The Jeep Wagoneer is a luxury 4x4 produced and marketed under the Jeep brand from the 1963 to 1991 model years. Introduced as the replacement for the Jeep Station Wagon, the Wagoneer was the first Jeep model line completely distinct from the Jeep CJ. Designed as a truck-based station wagon, the model line became a progenitor of the modern sport-utility vehicle (SUV). 

Designed under contract by industrial designer Brooks Stevens, the exterior of the Wagoneer was styled by engineer Dave Nutting. Sharing the Jeep SJ chassis (full-size Jeep) with the Jeep Gladiator/J-Series, the Wagoneer also shared its underpinnings with the introductory Jeep Cherokee. 

In 1966, Jeep introduced the high-content Super Wagoneer, upgrading the model line with features from higher-priced sedans. Though the trim was short-lived, the Wagoneer became upgraded in content and features throughout the 1970s. For 1984, the Jeep Grand Wagoneer was introduced (to distinguish the SJ from the smaller XJ Wagoneer), becoming its flagship trim. 

Through its 29-year production under a single generation (the third longest in U.S. automotive history), the Wagoneer underwent only nominal changes to its body structure and appearance. The model line was produced by Jeep through its ownership by Kaiser Jeep, AMC, and Chrysler. 

For 1993, Jeep revived the Grand Wagoneer nameplate as a flagship trim of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, again using its exterior wood trim. The nameplate remained dormant for 31 years until the introduction of the WS-chassis Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer (the largest Jeep SUVs ever produced). 

==Kaiser years==
With competition from the &quot;big three&quot; automakers advancing on Jeep&#x27;s four-wheel-drive market, Willys management decided that a new and more advanced vehicle was needed. Conceived in the early 1960s while Willys-Overland Motors was owned by Kaiser Jeep Corporation, the Wagoneer replaced the original Willys Jeep Station Wagon, originally introduced in July 1946 and produced until the 1964 model year.

It was introduced in November 1962 for the 1963 model year as a successor to the Willys Jeep Station Wagon that had been built since 1946. Although sharing a pickup truck chassis (like its predecessor), the Wagoneer had a sophisticated station wagon body design, that was more carlike than any other 4×4 on the market. Compared with offerings from GM, Ford, International Harvester, Toyota, Nissan and Land Rover — which were producing utilitarian work-oriented vehicles with spartan truck-like interiors — the Wagoneer&#x27;s luxury set it apart. Together with the Gladiator, the revolutionary Wagoneer SJ platform included an advanced overhead cam straight-six engine, and offered features unheard of at the time in any other mainstream 4WD vehicle, such as independent front suspension, power steering, automatic transmission, a factory radio, and optional air conditioning.

Like its long-lived predecessor, the new 1963 Wagoneer took shape under an industrial designer Brooks Stevens, while Willys&#x27; engineering staff handled the technical development. To appeal to mainstream consumers, the Wagoneer received a relatively low stance and car-like manners. The lower entry height was accomplished with a transfer case and a compact running gear design. Suspension tuning gave it a good ride, but because it was developed as a truck, it could haul and tow as needed. Development took three years and cost around US$20 million ($ in dollars).

At its introduction, the Jeep Wagoneer had no direct competition. For comparison, it took another eight years for Land Rover&#x27;s Range Rover to start in only a two-door body style. It took until 1981 for the four-door 4×4 to be developed and Range Rover sales in the United States began in 1987.

=== 1963–1964 ===
The original Wagoneer is a full-size body-on-frame vehicle that shared its architecture with the Gladiator pickup truck. At first, it offered many body types, suspension, and drivetrain options. Available as both two- or four-door wagons, the two-door could be had as a &quot;Panel Delivery&quot; model with windowless sides behind the doors and double &quot;barn doors&quot; in the rear instead of the usual tailgate and roll-down rear window.

Early Wagoneers were powered by Willys&#x27; new &quot;Tornado&quot; SOHC six-cylinder engine, which had debuted in 1962 as an option for Jeep&#x27;s previous Station Wagons. The engine developed and was noted for being fuel-efficient for its day. Both a 3-speed manual and automatic transmission were offered, each available with either rear-wheel-drive, or part-time four-wheel-drive without a center differential, but with manually locking front hubs. The Warn hubs were utilized to engage or disengage the front wheels, to switch the drivetrain between two-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive mode.

Like on the original Willys Wagon, independent front suspension instead of a rigid front axle was again offered to give the Wagoneer a more car-like ride and handling. The original Wagoneer featured independent front suspension (IFS) as standard on the rear-wheel drive models and was optional on the four-wheel drive, for either $135 or $160. 

Instead of the Wagon&#x27;s &quot;Planadyne&quot; design, the Wagoneer&#x27;s IFS used swing axles and torsion bar springs, but they combined with short upper A-arms, tied into the torsion bars at their inner pivot points, such that the swing axles served as the lower control arms in a kind of double wishbone suspension design and the axles are located fore and aft by control links. On the four-wheel-drives, the IFS replaced the standard Dana 27AF axle with a single, center-pivot front axle that allowed the Dana 27 differential to swing with the curb-side half. Further, all Wagoneers had 11-inch drum-brakes all-around; seat belts were optional, and the 4WD came with a standard compass. Front and rear power take-offs were available for heavy-duty utility applications.

Shortly after the introduction of the Wagoneer, in early 1963, Willys Motors changed its name to &quot;Kaiser Jeep Corporation.&quot;

The 1964 models introduced factory-optional air conditioning, as well as a lower-compression Tornado engine, to remedy cooling problems and &quot;pinging&quot; at altitude the original had sometimes suffered. While it made less power, it returned greater economy, but this lower-compression version was phased out within a year.

=== 1965–1966 ===
Starting with 1965, all models came with a new standard safety package that included front and rear seat belts, a padded dashboard, a high-impact windshield, and a dual braking system.

Late-year 1965 Wagoneers and Gladiators were available with the AMC V8 engine, which proved to be a popular option. Additionally, the Tornado engine was replaced by American Motors&#x27; OHV inline-six. According to the automotive press, this engine was smooth, powerful, reliable, and easily maintained, but the most likely reason it was offered was that it was less expensive.

Although the independent front suspension was positively reviewed, the option was not popular and was dropped from production, at least for the 4WD models, in 1965.

====Super Wagoneer====
The 1966 model year also saw the introduction of the more luxurious Super Wagoneer, identified by a new more modern-looking full-width grille. It initially featured a higher-performance version of the AMC V8, fitted with a four-barrel carburetor. With comfort and convenience features not standard or even available on other vehicles of its type at the time—such as push-button radio, seven-position tilt steering wheel, ceiling courtesy lights, air conditioning, power-retracting rear window into the tailgate, power brakes, power steering, and console-shifted TH400 automatic transmission—the Super Wagoneer is now widely regarded as the precursor of today&#x27;s luxury SUVs.

Production of the Super Wagoneer ended in 1969, and in total, it is believed that 3,989 Super Wagoneers had been produced.

=== 1967–1971 ===
Between 1967 and 1969, all rear-wheel-drive-only models, which the four-wheel-drives had outsold from the beginning, were discontinued, and from then on, all Wagoneers (and Cherokees) had solid axles and leaf springs, both front and rear. At the end of 1968, the slow-selling two-door versions were also discontinued.

For 1968 through 1971, Wagoneers were powered by Buick’s Dauntless V8. The Dauntless made less horsepower than the previous AMC V8 (230 hp vs. 250), but more torque at lower rpm ( at 2400 rpm versus at 2600).

After the 1971 model year, Wagoneers were exclusively powered by AMC&#x27;s engines.

==AMC years==

=== 1970 ===
In early 1970, AMC acquired Kaiser Jeep Corporation and began refining and upgrading the range. American Motors improved manufacturing efficiency and lowered costs by incorporating shared components such as engines. Reducing noise, vibration, and harshness improved the Wagoneer driving experience. Visually, a big change was made during the 1970 model year, by replacing the metal grille with a new plastic grille having an egg crate pattern instead of vertical bars.

=== 1971 ===
The 1971 model year included a special &quot;X-coded&quot; model finished in &quot;golden lime&quot; with unique wood-grain side panels, numerous convenience features, and power assists, that was priced $1,000 more than the deluxe &quot;custom&quot; model. After 1971, the outsourced Buick 350 was replaced by the AMC V8, with the later becoming available.

=== 1972–1977 ===
The innovative Quadra-Trac full-time four-wheel-drive system, which broadened the appeal of Jeep products to people who wanted four-wheel-drive traction without the inconvenience of a manual-shift transfer case and manual locking hubs, was introduced in 1973.

In 1974, AMC redesigned the greenhouse of the defunct two-door Wagoneer, with much wider D-pillars and single, long rear side windows, and reintroduced it as the Cherokee. This replaced the Jeepster Commando, whose sales had not met expectations despite an extensive 1972 revamp. The Cherokee appealed to a younger market than the Wagoneer, which was regarded as a family SUV.

Also in 1974, front disc brakes were introduced as standard equipment. While the new Cherokees still had 4-wheel drum brakes standard, front discs could be had as an option.

From 1976, all Wagoneer and Cherokee models received strengthened frames with stronger cross-members and boxed side rail construction.

=== 1978 ===
After the introduction of the Cherokee, AMC began to move the Wagoneer upmarket, and that brought high demand from a new market segment. Midway through 1978, the &quot;Limited&quot; was introduced, more luxuriously equipped than the earlier Super Wagoneer, offering Quadra-Trac, power disk brakes, air conditioning, power-adjustable bucket seats, power door locks, power windows, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, leather upholstery, plush carpeting, AM/FM/CB radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, roof rack, forged aluminum wheels, and &quot;wood grain&quot; trim on the body sides. The two-barrel, AMC V8 engine was standard with a four-barrel, available at extra cost. Even though the US$10,500 ($ in dollars) suggested retail price was in luxury Cadillac and Lincoln territory, the Limited&#x27;s high-level specification attracted buyers and sales were strong with a total of 28,871 Wagoneers produced in 1978, and 27,437 in 1979.

=== 1979 ===
On other SJ models, there were few styling changes until 1979, when all Wagoneer, Cherokee, and J-Series pickup models received a substantial styling update with one-piece aluminum bumpers and a new one-piece chrome plastic grille with a protruding middle section shaped somewhat like a pig&#x27;s nose, horizontal slats, and square headlights. This front-end appearance was described as the &quot;pig nose grill&quot; continued on Wagoneer models through 1985.

=== 1980 ===
For the 1980 model year, AMC decided to offer the four-wheel-drive platform using a station wagon body style but on a compact platform and introduced the AMC Eagle.

With the V8s the primary choice among Wagoneer buyers, the six-cylinder engine was dropped in the 1970s, only to return as an option when Jeep sales – particularly of the high-volume Cherokee – were hit by the 1979 energy crisis. The Wagoneer continued to sell relatively well in comparison to luxurious station wagons offered by Ford, Chrysler, and GM, while production dropped to 10,481 in 1980, but increased to 13,741 in 1981, 18,709 in 1982, and 18,478 in 1983. When reintroduced, the engine came with a manual transmission as standard equipment, but in 1983, automatic transmissions with “Selec-Trac” four-wheel drive became standard. With this combination, the Wagoneer achieved EPA fuel-consumption estimates of city and highway – outstanding for a full-size SUV. This allowed the company to advertise good fuel mileage, although the more powerful 360 V8 remained popular with certain buyers despite its greater thirst for fuel.

=== 1981-1982 ===
In 1981, the Wagoneer line was expanded to three models. The Custom Wagoneer was the basic model, yet it included a four-speed transmission, free-wheeling hubs, power steering, and power front disc brakes, as well as passenger area carpeting. A new Brougham model added an upgraded interior trim that included woodgrain for the instrument cluster and horn cover, floor mats, power tailgate window, as well as the &quot;convenience&quot; and &quot;light&quot; packages. The Brougham&#x27;s exterior included a thin side body scuff molding with a narrow woodgrain insert, a roof rack, as well as bright door and quarter window frames, and a lower tailgate molding. The Wagoneer Limited was the top-of-the-line with standard Quadra-Trac, automatic transmission, air conditioning, tinted glass, power windows, and door locks, cruise control, AM/FM stereo radio, extra-quiet insulation, power six-way driver and passenger bucket seats with center armrest, upgraded door panels, leather-wrapped steering wheel, extra thick carpeting, and a retractable cargo cover.

=== 1983 ===
The basic &quot;Custom&quot; model was dropped starting with the 1983 model year, and a new Selec-Trac system became standard equipment. A dash-mounted control allowed the driver to change between two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive. The switch activated a vacuum-activated spline clutch that was built into the transfer case that engaged the front axle assembly. A shift lever mounted on the side of the transmission hump allowed the driver to shift between four-high and four-low with the vehicle moving, although the transmission had to be shifted to neutral and the vehicle had to be moving at less than five miles per hour to accomplish this.

===1984: SJ and XJ ===
For 1984, AMC replaced the SJ-body Cherokee with the all-new, compact, and more fuel-efficient unibody Jeep Cherokee (XJ), and introduced an upscale version of the (XJ) known as the Wagoneer. The compact XJ Wagoneer was available in two trim levels: the &quot;Wagoneer&quot; and the &quot;Wagoneer Limited.&quot; AMC originally intended for these vehicles to replace the SJ-body Wagoneer models, but high demand prompted the company to keep the old SJ-body Wagoneer in production alongside them even though the design, largely unchanged since 1962, was becoming increasingly antiquated.

The SJ-body Wagoneer line saw consolidation in 1984 with the end of the &quot;Brougham&quot; model, while the &quot;Limited&quot; was renamed the &quot;Grand Wagoneer&quot; to free up the &quot;Wagoneer Limited&quot; nameplate for the compact XJ Wagoneer. In mid-1984, AMC introduced a less expensive version called the Wagoneer &quot;Custom&quot;, without the simulated woodgrain exterior. The Custom had steel wheels with hubcaps, standard equipment was pared down, and it had part-time four-wheel drive. Despite its lower price (US$15,995, about $3,000 less than the &quot;Grand&quot;), sales were low, and it was dropped after 1984.

Thus, at the end of 1984, production reached 20,019 with just one fully equipped version available. The Grand Wagoneer remained &quot;the gold standard of the SUV market&quot; and from 1985 it would continue in one version using the old SJ-body until the end of the Grand Wagoneer production under Chrysler.

For the Mexican market, the Grand Wagoneer was built and distributed by Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos, and was offered with the 282 CI engine.

=== 1985 ===
An improved handling package was introduced in 1985 that incorporated a revised front sway bar, gas-filled shock absorbers, and lower friction rear springs. A total of 17,814 Grand Wagoneers were built for 1985.

=== 1986 ===
Starting in the 1986 model year, the Grand Wagoneer received a new four-part front grille and a stand-up hood ornament. An updated audio system became a standard feature and a power sunroof installed by American Sunroof Corporation became a factory option. However, the most significant change was the installation of a fully revamped interior including a new dash pad, new instrumentation, new door panel design, shorter nap cut-pile carpeting, new leather, and corduroy seat cover designs as well as front seats that now featured adjustable headrests. Changes were made to the instrument panel that now featured square gauges, and contained an improved climate control system. The metal glove box door was also replaced with a plastic door featuring a woodgrain overlay. A new two-spoke steering wheel also included new stalks for the lights and wiper and washer controls on the column. The Selec-Trac driveline gained a new Trac-Lok limited-slip differential to send power to the wheel with the best traction. There were 17,254 Grand Wagoneers built in 1986.
=== 1987 ===
The last model year developed under AMC, 1987, was also the 25th anniversary of the Wagoneer design. Standard equipment included the V8 engine and self-sealing Michelin &quot;Tru Seal&quot; P235/75R 15 radial tires. The sound system included a new AM/FM electronically-tuned stereo with a Dolby cassette player and four Jensen speakers. The exterior featured revised woodgrained sides in &quot;marine teak&quot; with new nameplates and V8 badges. On the inside were new tan or cordovan trims that replaced the honey and garnet colors, while the interior assist pulls on the door panels were removed. A combined 14,265 units were built by AMC and Chrysler for 1987.

Standard equipment for late Grand Wagoneers included:
* 15″ Michelin all-season whitewall radial tires
* 15″ alloy wheels
* AM/FM stereo with cassette player
* Four AccuSound by Jensen premium speakers
* Air conditioning and heater with manual controls
* Dual front power bucket seats
* Leather-wrapped two-spoke steering wheel
* Leather and velour seating surfaces
* Digital quartz dashboard clock
* Full-size glove box
* Roof rack with roof rails
* Chrome front grille with a hood ornament
* Front fog driving lamps
* Power windows and power door locks
* Adjustable tilt steering column
* Dual-note high-low-pitch horn
* Power rear hatch window
* Rear window defroster 
* Tinted windows 
* Faux wood body side vinyl wood appliques
* Cargo cover
* Overhead console with compass and thermometer (1989–1991)
* Keyless entry (1989–1991)
* Rear window wiper/washer (1989–1991)

Optional equipment included:
* Towing package
* Power sunroof/moonroof

==Chrysler years==

=== 1987–1991 ===
Chrysler bought out American Motors Corporation on March 2, 1987. At the time, AMC was already working on designing a replacement for the antiquated SJ platform. Chrysler had other priorities, and although the Jeep J-Series pickups that shared the SJ platform and directly competed with Chrysler&#x27;s Dodge Ram pickups were discontinued in 1988, Chrysler left the Grand Wagoneer largely untouched over its first few years overseeing Jeep production, and even continued to build the model with the carbureted AMC V8 instead of its own (arguably, more modern) fuel-injected V8. Year-to-year changes were minimal. At the time of Chrysler&#x27;s purchase, customer demand for the Grand Wagoneer continued to be steady, and it was a very profitable model generating approximately five to six thousand dollars on each unit.

The 1989–1991 model years are considered the &quot;best of the breed&quot; because of many improvements. These include upgraded wood siding and modernized aluminum alloy wheels that lost their gold-colored inlays in favor of gunmetal grey metallic. Chrysler also introduced an electrocoat primer for better rust-proofing and all exterior colors were now applied in a two-stage base-clearcoat system. In 1988, Jeep&#x27;s first full year under Chrysler, a total of 14,117 Grand Wagoneers were produced.

Many improvements were made for the 1989–1991 model year series, including a quality replacement for the earlier, leak-prone air conditioning compressor, the addition of the visually identifiable rear wiper/washer assembly, as well as a general improvement in fit and finish. An interior overhead console, taken from Chrysler&#x27;s popular minivans, was also added. This functional console featured much brighter map lights, an outside temperature sensor and compass, a storage compartment for sunglasses as well as an infrared remote-controlled keyless entry system.

The last three model years also featured several new exterior paint colors and the tan interior color was replaced with a lighter color that Jeep called &quot;sand.&quot; The &quot;new&quot; exterior colors included a hunter green metallic that was only available in the 1991 model year and is the paint color of the 1991 Grand Wagoneer in the Chrysler Museum, as well as the color of the very last Grand Wagoneer ever made.

===Discontinuation===
The Wagoneer enjoyed one of the longest production runs of any Jeep product. Despite its combined fuel economy of only 11 miles per gallon, its powerful 5.9 liter V8 engine and high towing capacity, and the fact that unlike most competitive full-size SUVs of the era it had four doors, made the Grand Wagoneer popular among its many repeat buyers through the 1960s, 70s, and 80s. By 1991, it was the longest-running domestically produced vehicle (29 years) on the same platform.

As a result of the 1990 oil price shock, gasoline prices in the United States rose 11 percent in less than a year. Sales of the gas-guzzling Grand Wagoneer plummeted from over 10,000 units in 1989 to 6,449 in 1990. Slow sales continued during the Gulf War and only 4253 Grand Wagoneers were produced in the 1991 model year. In addition to its poor fuel economy, the antiquated SJ platform would have required extensive re-engineering to comply with new Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards that would apply to all light trucks and sport utility vehicles sold in the United States by the mid-1990s. As a result, on February 27, 1991, Chrysler announced that it was ending production of the Grand Wagoneer, leaving the Jeep line without a full-size SUV. Buyers of 1991 Grand Wagoneers sold after that date had the option of having a gold &quot;Final Edition Jeep Grand Wagoneer&quot; badge on the dashboard.

The last SJ Grand Wagoneer produced rolled out of Chrysler&#x27;s Toledo Assembly Plant on June 21, 1991.

===Collectibility===

Even before Chrysler assembled the final SJ Grand Wagoneer, there were specialized companies that were refurbishing and restoring them. Grand Wagoneers that are in top condition seem not to decrease in value.

The 1989–1991 model years are considered &quot;the best of the breed and still have a loyal following among a select group.&quot; Later model, low mileage, rust-free Grand Wagoneers have become highly collectible with some pristine examples selling for more than their original sticker price over three decades after they rolled off the assembly line.

In 2013, the 1963–1991 models were in a list of eight SUVs that have become collectibles and, depending on the condition, desirable items at car auctions.

By 2019, the appraisal values of Grand Wagoneers had been increasing an average of 2–6 percent with each bi-monthly update for most of past ten years according to Hagerty. 

By 2021, the 1984 through 1991 Jeep Grand Wagoneers that &quot;created the blueprint followed by countless others&quot; were among the most sought-after cars during the COVID-19 pandemic according to Hagerty, and in the top nine of a curated list of the best vintage cars on the market.

==1993: Grand Wagoneer (ZJ)==
The Jeep Grand Wagoneer nameplate reappeared for one year as the top-of-the-line model of the new Jeep ZJ platform debuted for the Grand Cherokee for the 1993 model year. It featured a long list of standard equipment including the Magnum 5.2 L V8 engine and unique leather interior as well as the Grand Wagoneer&#x27;s traditional exterior woodgrain applique. After 6,378 were produced, the model was dropped for 1994, leaving the Grand Cherokee Limited as the top-of-the-line Jeep.

==Motor sport==
The Wagoneer was occasionally used in rallying, mainly in the United States. Wagoneers placed first and second in the first-ever running of the Sno*Drift rally in 1973.

A Grand Wagoneer also competed in the grueling 1988 Trans-Amazon Rally.

==Revival==

Chrysler Group CEO Sergio Marchionne announced at the January 2011 North American International Auto Show held in Detroit, that the Grand Wagoneer name was to be revived for an &quot;upper-scale&quot; seven-seat SUV, which he said would be introduced in 2013. In May 2014, Chrysler&#x27;s &quot;Five-Year Plan&quot; was unveiled, which included the intention to release a flagship vehicle called the Grand Wagoneer that would share a platform with the Durango and Grand Cherokee by the 2018 model year. The Grand Wagoneer would be sold alongside the Durango and the Grand Cherokee.

On June 9, 2015, Fiat Chrysler announced that it would unveil a new version of the full-sized Grand Wagoneer at its dealers&#x27; convention on August 25, 2015. In August 2015, however, Fiat announced that the production of the upcoming Grand Cherokee replacement would be delayed into 2018. It was scheduled to be built at Warren Truck Assembly while the next-generation Ram 1500 was to be built at Sterling Heights Assembly.

On September 3, 2020, Jeep revealed the concept vehicle, along with other models and their 4xe electric hybrid technology.

On March 11, 2021, Jeep officially revealed the Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer models, with both being based on the concept.

<doc id="1162721" wikidata="Q742368" url="?curid=1162721" title="Block (sailing)">
<text>In sailing, a block is a single or multiple pulley. One or a number of &quot;sheaves&quot; are enclosed in an assembly between &quot;cheeks&quot; or &quot;chocks&quot;. In use, a block is fixed to the end of a line, to a spar, or to a surface. A line (rope) is &quot;reeved&quot; through the sheaves, and maybe through one or more matching blocks at some far end, to make up a tackle.

The &quot;purchase&quot; of a tackle refers to its mechanical advantage. In general the more sheaves in the blocks that make up a tackle, the higher its mechanical advantage. The matter is slightly complicated by the fact that every tackle has a &quot;working end&quot; where the final run of rope leaves the last sheave. More mechanical advantage can be obtained if this end is attached to the moving load rather than the fixed end of the tackle.

There are various types of blocks that are used in sailing. Some blocks are used to increase mechanical advantage and others are used simply to change the direction of a line. A &quot;ratchet block&quot; turns freely when a line is pulled in one direction but does not turn the other direction, although the line may slip past the sheave. This kind of block makes a loaded line easier to hold by hand, and is sometimes used on smaller boats for lines like main and jib sheets that are frequently adjusted.

A single, large, sail-powered warship in the mid-19th century required more than 1,400 blocks of various kinds.

==Sailing terms in everyday English==
; Chock a&#x27; block : Refers literally to the situation where pulling on the working line will not raise the load any further because the cheeks of one lifting block are already against the other. Figuratively this has come to mean that something is as full or as close as it can be.

<text>Aigeira () (, or Αἴγειρα, ) is a town and a former municipality in northeastern Achaea, West Greece, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it has been a municipal unit of the Aigialeia municipality, with an area of 103.646 km2. The municipal unit stretches from the Gulf of Corinth, where the town of Aigeira is located, to the mountains in the south. The town of Aigeira is southeast of Aigio, northwest of Corinth and east of Patras.

The archaeological site of ancient Aigeira is located approximately from the modern town. It is an important site for the Mycenaean and later periods, with particularly extensive remains from the Hellenistic period. It has been excavated since 1916 by archaeologists from the Austrian Archaeological Institute at Athens.

==History==
===Prehistory===
(Location of the ancient site: )

Settlement at Aigeira is known from the Middle Neolithic and Final Neolithic, beginning around 5500 BCE. The first settlement was situated on the acropolis, and has furnished evidence of pottery, including vessels likely used in the production of cheese. A small quantity of obsidian blades, using material from Melos, have also been found from this period. Some evidence of Neolithic settlement has been found on a lower plateau, approximately 150m to the east of the acropolis.

Patterns of settlement around the Gulf of Corinth in the Final Neolithic show a few &#x27;main sites&#x27; and a much greater number of apparently transient settlements, used only briefly before abandonment. In the Early Helladic period (beginning around 3100 BCE), settlements appear to become more permanent, being used over multiple chronological phases, and to be involved in more intense contacts between each other, particularly maritime exchange. While there is a great deal of evidence for social and cultural continuity at Aigeira between the Final Neolithic and Early Helladic, particularly as concerns patterns of food production and consumption, there are also signs of technological development, particularly in higher-temperature ceramic production, the use of flax or double fibres in textiles, and possibly the addition of arsenic to copper in metallurgy.

In the EH II period, the acropolis site was abandoned, and settlement moved to a low-lying and more fertile site at Kassaneva, close to the Krios river. The acropolis was re-occupied in the Middle Helladic period: little evidence of this phase survives, though what does exist points to new cultural connections with the western Peloponnese. 

Relatively little is known of Aigeira for most of the Late Helladic period. Aigeira has been proposed as the centre of one of two putative Mycenaean states in Achaia, but no signs of palatial structures or administration have been found at the site, making it difficult to argue that Aigeira was the centre of the sort of state apparatus seen in contemporary palatial centres like Mycenae or Pylos. Indeed, the relatively low level of monumentality found in tombs and buildings at this period suggests that local elites, while undoubtedly evidenced from the use of chamber tombs, did not possess the ability to mobilise even relatively small amounts of skilled labour, unlike the contemporary palatial elites elsewhere. Furthermore, the lack of &quot;tholos&quot; tombs in the vicinity, which are closely associated with palatial elites at other Mycenaean sites, lacks a conclusive explanation: it has been argued that this situation may represent the lack of penetration of palatial social structures and ideology into Achaea, or perhaps that distant centres, such as Mycenae and Aegina, were able to inhibit the growth of Achaean elites, if not to control them directly.

Only a few pieces of pottery are known from the LH IIIB period, mostly found on the terraces below the acropolis, and it is possible that the settlement moved to another location, perhaps nearer the coast, during LH IIIB, returning to its original location early in LH IIIC.

In the LH IIIC period, the settlement appears to have been destroyed by fire, and rebuilt soon after. Of particular note in this phase is the substantial fortification wall constructed on the eastern side of the new settlement – the only such structure known from this period on the Greek mainland, and one of only two contemporary examples known in the Aegean (alongside Naxos). Unusually for Aegean sites in this period, LH IIIC appears to have been a time of sustained occupation, growth and prosperity: excavations between 2011 and 2016 found evidence of a &#x27;lower town&#x27;, approximately 12,000m2 in area, centred on the acropolis and occupied over numerous chronological phases in LH IIIC. The distributions of finds of pottery, particularly &quot;pithoi&quot;, led excavators to conclude that this was a settlement composed of households, characterised by the storage and production of goods as well as feasting. A &#x27;cult room&#x27; for religious purposes also dates to this period. Evidence of pottery practices suggests a degree of cultural continuity with the pre-destruction era, with characteristic Mycenaean shapes continuing to be manufactured.

Tombs associated with Aigeira have been found dating to the early part of Late Helladic III, including chamber tombs excavated by the Greek archaeologist Nikolaos Verdelis in 1956 at Lykovouno/Derveni, approximately 1.2 km southeast of the settlement. In LH IIIC, these tombs continued to be re-used, but some innovations in funerary practice are observed: instead of re-opening the chambers and interring new bodies, rectangular trenches, known as &#x27;dormitories&#x27;, were dug into the floors of the tombs.

===Classical and Hellenistic Periods===


Like many Aegean sites, Aigeira was abandoned at the end of the Bronze Age, following the destruction of the site at the end of LH IIIC Middle. Occupation began again in the second half of the 8th century BCE, likely associated with the sanctuary at the site, and included areas of the &#x27;lower town&#x27; previously occupied in LH IIIC. Some partial fortifications are known from the Archaic period, covering an area of around 3.5 hectares.

In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Aigeira was known as Hyperesia. In the 2nd century CE, Pausanias recorded a story of how the town came to change its name:

Pausanias relates that the old name of &#x27;Hyperesia&#x27; continued in use: indeed, he elsewhere records that Icarus of Hyperesia was proclaimed victor in the 23rd Olympiad in 688 BC; Eusebius refers his name as Icarius., while Cratinus, the winner of the Olympic prize for boys&#x27; wrestling in 260 BC, is named as a citizen of &#x27;Aigeira&#x27;.

Aigeira was a member of the Achaean League during its first period of existence in the early fourth century BCE, and again when it was re-founded in 284 BCE, after collapsing shortly after 323 BCE. During this period, probably early in the 4th century, the nearby town of Aigai appears to have been abandoned or become depopulated, and its citizens incorporated into the citizen body of Aigeira. Perhaps in commemoration of this, the coins of Aigeira began to use the symbol of a goat, previously used in the coinage of Aigai, and continued to do so throughout the Classical and Hellenistic periods.

The Hellenistic period appears to have been a time of great growth, with the size of the settlement increasing by as much as fourteen times, perhaps owing to money from the Achaean League. The city was re-fortified in this period with a circuit wall, which encompassed around 50 ha. Excavations in the later 20th century uncovered a building complex, known as the &#x27;guest house&#x27;, dating approximately to the mid-4th century BCE. This building included mosaic flooring and has been suggested to have been a residence for foreign diplomatic delegations. It was used until the 1st century BCE, by which point it had been extended and modified multiple times and occupied a surface area around 1,000 m2.

Around 280 BCE, the theatre was built, along with an adjacent &quot;naiskos&quot;. Throughout the Hellenistic period, the area of the theatre became the central point for public building, and further structures, including a temple dedicated to the goddess Tyche, were added. To this period also belong the 2nd-century-BCE fragments of a colossal statue of Zeus, sculpted by the Athenian sculptor Eucleides, now held in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens and once displayed in a temple of Zeus. Other temples in the upper town included a temple of Apollo and temples of Artemis Agrotera and of Aphrodite Urania, and of the Syrian Goddess. According to Pausanias, Serapis and Isis were also worshipped in the city, pointing to contact with Ptolemaic Egypt.

Along with the other members of the Achaean League, Aigeira fought alongside Philip V of Macedon against the Aetolian League in the Social War of 220-217 BCE. In the early stages of the war, in 219 BCE, the city was attacked and temporarily occupied by Aetolian forces, who had set sail from the opposite town of Oeantheia in Locris. A hoard of nearly 600 silver coins, found in the so-called &#x27;guest house&#x27; has been conjectured to have been hidden there in the course of this raid.

By the 2nd century CE, when Pausanias visited, the city consisted of two parts, both known as &#x27;Aigeira&#x27;: a port on the Gulf of Corinth and the upper town, 12 stadia () from the port. Between around 150 CE and 250 CE, the natural harbour was supplemented with concrete constructions, particularly two breakwaters built in &quot;opus caementicium&quot;. It is possible that earlier harbour structures existed, since obscured by the Roman construction and later seismic activity.

Aigeira continued to be occupied throughout the Roman period, and new structures were built into Late Antiquity, sometimes re-using spolia from older buildings.

In the 3rd century CE, a massive seismic uplift left the harbour structures approximately four metres above sea level, rendering the port unusable; this event may be connected with a third-century earthquake which destroyed the city itself. Aigeira underwent a period of decline in the 4th and 5th century CE, with an apparent fall in population and the conversion of many formerly public buildings and temples into workshops.

===Medieval Period===

The acropolis continued to be occupied until at least the 12th century, as attested by finds of coins and pottery; a new conduit for water was built at some point during this period. Some time in the medieval period, the site was re-fortified with a perimeter wall incorporating many ancient spolia, which likely dates to approximately the 11th-12th centuries.

===Modern Times===

Around 1900, the so-called &#x27;Houses of the Raisin-Pickers&#x27; were built, using &quot;spolia&quot; from the ancient city, which appears by this time to have been in use as a large quarry.

==Archaeology==

Early excavations at Aigeira were often partial and patchily recorded. In the late 19th century, the Greek archaeologist Valerios Stais uncovered an inscription bearing part of Diocletian&#x27;s Edict on Maximum Prices, issued in 301 CE, though he did not record either the precise circumstances or the location of the finds. During his survey of the Peloponnese in 1836, William Martin Leake discovered the remains of the harbour at a small cove then known as Mavra Litharia, but they attracted little archaeological attention until the 1990s. In 1904, Hans Schrader acquired objects from a Mycenaean grave with &#x27;Aigeira&#x27; listed as the find-spot, but the excavation that produced these has gone unrecorded.

The first formal excavations took place in 1916 and 1925 under Otto Walter and the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Vienna. Walter discovered the Hellenistic theatre, as well as three &quot;naiskoi&quot; in the area.

In 1972, excavations resumed under Wilhelm Alzinger, who led them until 1988. Alzinger&#x27;s excavations focused on the acropolis, the theatre, the ruins of the temple of Zeus and the space between the theatre and the temple of Zeus. Several further &quot;naiskoi&quot; were discovered near the theatre, including one with a pebble floor mosaic representing an eagle with a serpent, as well as the &quot;Tycheion &quot;(sanctuary of Tyche) described by Pausanias. Between 1975 and 1980, much of the &#x27;lower town&#x27; was also uncovered. During Alzinger&#x27;s tenure, Sigrid Deger-Jalkotzy worked on the excavations from 1975 to 1986, primarily analysing and publishing the late Mycenaean pottery.

Excavations between 1990 and 1997, under Anton Bammer, focused on a survey of the urban area and investigated, &quot;inter alia&quot;, the water supply and public spaces of the city. Georg Ladstätter lead the excavations from 1998, with continued focus on the water supply and on domestic buildings.

Since 2002, excavations have been under the jurisdiction of the Austrian Archaeological Institute at Athens. In 2007, the so-called &#x27;prehistoric layer&#x27; was uncovered and defined, providing the first proof of habitation at Aigeira before the Bronze Age. From 2011 until 2018, excavations took place in the theatre, under the direction of Walter Gauss.

==Subdivisions==
The municipal unit of Aigeira is subdivided into the following communities:
*Aigeira
*Aiges
*Ampelokipoi
*Chrysanthio
*Exochi
*Monastiri
*Oasi
*Perithori
*Seliana
*Sinevro
*Vella

==Historical population==
==Sport==
The town is home to the Aigeira Municipal Stadium, which features an artificial turf pitch and a gravel running track. 
Its major soccer team is A.O. Thyella Aigeiras. Since July 2018 the club merged with the local football team of the neighbour town of Akrata forming a new club under the name A.E. Aigeiras/Akratas. Aigeira is also home to non-league amateur football club Panaigeiratikos.

== Transport ==
The Greek National Road 8A (E65 Corinth - Patras) and the Corinth-Patras railway run through the town.

<text>The Moluccan eclectus (Eclectus roratus) is a parrot native to the Maluku Islands (Moluccas). It is unusual in the parrot order for its extreme sexual dimorphism of the colours of the plumage; the male having a mostly bright emerald green plumage and the female a mostly bright red and purple/blue plumage. Joseph Forshaw, in his book &quot;Parrots of the World,&quot; noted that the first European ornithologists to see eclectus parrots thought they were of two distinct species. Large populations of this parrot remain, and they are sometimes considered pests for eating fruit off trees. Some populations restricted to relatively small islands are comparably rare. Their bright feathers are also used by native tribespeople in New Guinea as decorations.

==Taxonomy==
Ornithologists usually classify the Moluccan eclectus as a member of tribe Psittaculini in the family Psittacidae of order Psittaciformes. However, some recent thoughts indicate a great deal of commonality between the eclectus parrots and the Lorini tribe.

Sir D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson noted similarities in the skull were noted between the eclectus parrots and members of the genus &quot;Geoffroyus&quot;, specifically in the auditory meatus and the prefrontal reaching but not joining the squamosal bones. The skull of members the genus &quot;Tanygnathus&quot; is also generally similar.

===Subspecies===

Three subspecies of Moluccan eclectus are known, although the species as a whole needs reviewing. Access to some regions where the species occurs is difficult due to geographical or political reasons, hence field observations have been limited. Furthermore, many skins collected in the early part of the 19th century have deteriorated in some museums. However, most eclectus skins in US museums are in good condition. In captivity in the U.S., some of the most common subspecies are Vosmaer&#x27;s, and the New Guinea red-sided.

*&quot;E. r. roratus&quot;, known as the grand eclectus, is found on Buru, Seram, Ambon, Saparua, and Haruku in the southern Maluku Islands. The subspecies begins intergrading with race &quot;vosmaeri&quot; on Seram.
*&quot;E. r. vosmaeri&quot;, known as Vosmaer&#x27;s eclectus or Vos eclectus, was originally described by Rothschild and is named after Dutch naturalist Arnout Vosmaer, who described the bird in his writings in 1769, noting it as new to science, based upon a female individual discovered in his collection. Larger in size than the nominate subspecies with more yellow in the plumage, it is found on islands in the North Maluku province. The male has more yellow-toned plumage on the head and neck. The tail is bluer and has a small pale lemon yellow border. The female is a brighter red on the head, back, and wings. Her undertail coverts are yellow and at least an inch of the tail is bright pure yellow. Vosmaer&#x27;s eclectus is the most commonly kept subspecies in aviculture.
*&quot;E. r. westermani&quot;, known as Westerman&#x27;s eclectus – many of the museum specimens have clipped wings and clipped tails, and no uniformity is seen in the coloration of the female specimens, indicating the likelihood of these specimens being crossbred aviary birds. However, Joseph Forshaw doubted it was an aberration, and its status remains unclear. If it ever existed, it is extinct today.

==Description==
The Moluccan eclectus is unusual in the parrot family for its marked visible light sexual dimorphism in the colours of the plumage. A stocky short-tailed parrot, it measures around in length. The male is mostly bright green with a yellow-tinge on the head. It has blue primaries, and red flanks and underwing coverts. Its tail is edged with a narrow band of creamy yellow and is dark grey edged with creamy yellow underneath, and the tail feathers are green centrally and bluer as they get towards the edges. The grand Eclectus female is mostly bright red with a darker hue on the back and wings. The mantle and underwing coverts darken to a more purple in colour, and the wing is edged with a mauve-blue. The tail is edged with yellowish-orange above and is more orange tipped with yellow underneath. The upper mandible of the adult male is orange at the base fading to a yellow towards the tip, and the lower mandible is black. The beak of the adult female is all black. Adults have yellow to orange irises and juveniles have dark brown to black irises. The upper mandible of both male and female juveniles are brown at the base fading to yellow towards the biting edges and the tip.
The abdomen and nape of the females are blue in most subspecies, purple abdomen and nape in the subspecies (&quot;roratus&quot;) and lavender abdomen and nape in the (&quot;vosmaeri&quot;). Females of &quot;riedeli&quot; and &quot;vosmaeri&quot; also have yellow undertail coverts. The female &quot;vosmaeri&quot; displays the brightest red of all the subspecies, both on the head and body. They don&#x27;t tend to talk in clear voices until they are 1 year old.

A blue colour mutation has appeared in avicultural eclectus populations as a result of a recessive gene. The cock bird is light blue, while the hen is a combination of dark blue, white and grey.

==Diet==
The diet of the Moluccan eclectus in the wild consists of mainly fruits, wild figs, unripe nuts, flower and leaf buds, and some seeds. In captivity, they should eat a lower sugar diet for their health as they are not flying the same mileage as a wild bird, even though they crave most fruits including mangos, figs, guavas, bananas, melons, stone fruits, grapes, citrus fruits, pears, apples, pomegranate, and papaya. The eclectus has an unusually long digestive tract, so tolerates a high-fiber diet. In captivity, the Moluccan eclectus benefits from specially formulated pellets or bird biscuit diet, backed up with daily serves of 2 to 3 fruits, and 5 vegetables (&amp; leafy greens such as endive and dandelion), and a small amount of seeds and nuts such as almonds and walnuts to be used as treats. Keeping seed and nuts to be fed by hand as treats restricts over intake of oils, which can happen if these are just put into feed bowls.

==Breeding==
In its natural habitat, the Moluccan eclectus nests within hollows in large, emergent rainforest trees. Suitable hollows are at a premium and the hen vigorously defends her chosen nesting site from other females (perhaps even fighting to the death), remaining resident at &#x27;her tree&#x27; for up to 11 months of the year, rarely straying from the entrance to her hollow and relying on multiple males to feed her via regurgitation. Males may travel up to 20 km to forage and up to five males will regularly provide food for each female, each competing with the others for her affections and the right to father her young. Unlike other parrot species, eclectus parrots are polygynandrous—females may mate with multiple male suitors and males may travel from nesting site to nesting site to mate with multiple females. This unique breeding strategy may explain the pronounced sexual dimorphism of the eclectus, as the female must remain conspicuous at the entry to the nest hole (to advertise her presence at her hollow to males and rival females), but well hidden when in the depths of the nest, because the red color hides her well in the darkness. The male is primarily a brilliant green color, which offers camouflage amongst the trees whilst foraging. However, the plumage of both sexes appears spectacular when viewed in the ultraviolet spectrum, an ability which predators such as hawks and owls lack.

Two white eggs are laid, which are incubated for 28–30 days. Young fledge at about 11 weeks.
Although eclectus parrots may reach sexual maturity earlier or later, they usually reach it between 2–3 years.

Moluccan eclectus hens have a strong maternal instinct, which is displayed in captivity, where they constantly seek possible nesting places, climbing into cupboards, drawers, and spaces beneath furniture, and becoming very possessive and defensive of these locations. An unpaired hen may go on to lay infertile eggs with little encouragement in the spring. It is often possible to place abandoned eggs from other parrot species beneath a broody eclectus hen, which she will readily accept and then incubate to the point of hatching, even rearing the hatched chick up to the point it is removed from the nest.

Adult females with poor nest hollows often commit infanticide on the male, if they produce both a male and a female chick. Inadequate nest hollows have a habit of flooding in heavy rain, drowning the chicks or eggs inside. This reported infanticide in wild pairs may be the result of other causes, since this behavior where the hen selectively kills male chicks is not observed in captive birds.

==Aviculture==
Moluccan eclectus parrots are one of the more popular birds kept in captivity, as either parent or hand reared. Unlike many other species of parrot they are relatively easy to breed yet difficult to hand feed.

Moluccan eclectus are generally calm birds in captivity, displaying a pensive affect when faced with novel items or situations, which may give rise to the mistaken impression that the species is &#x27;dull-witted&#x27;. The eclectus may also exhibit more neophobia than other species of companion bird. Eclectus parrots are prone to feather destruction (picking, pulling, cutting, and / or barbing) in captivity.

The subspecies &quot;E. r. vosmaeri&quot; is the most commonly kept in aviculture over all.

The average lifespan of the Moluccan eclectus in captivity is unknown, since these birds were not kept in captivity in great numbers until the 1980s. Some sources consider the lifespan to be 30 years. The maximum reliably recorded longevity for this species is 28.5 years, but a lifespan of 40.8 years has also been reported.

Moluccan eclectus in captivity are prone to &quot;toe tapping&quot; – characterized by involuntary extension and contractions of the muscles of the feet that cause the bird to constantly tap its toenails against a perch. It is believed to be related to bird&#x27;s diet and may be a result of providing the eclectus with food fortified with vitamins, processed food intended for humans (particularly containing man-made vitamins or preservatives) or food containing spirulina.

<text>Uriah Forrest (1756 – July 6, 1805) was an American statesman and military leader from Maryland. Forrest was born in St. Mary&#x27;s County in the Province of Maryland, near Leonardtown. In his early childhood, he received only limited schooling. Born into a family with three other brothers, he was the direct descendant of a person who came to Jamestown, Virginia, in 1608.

==Revolutionary War==
He served in varying roles within the Maryland Line. From January 14, 1776, until July 1776 he served as a 1st lieutenant in John Gunby&#x27;s Independent Maryland Company. When this ended, he became a captain in the 3rd Battalion of the Maryland Flying Camp, until December 1776 when he was promoted to major and transferred to the 3rd Maryland Regiment. As a result of the change of military positions, he did not fight at the Battle of Brooklyn, unlike the 1st Maryland Regiment commanded by William Smallwood (&quot;Smallwood&#x27;s Battalion&quot;) and other military units, which fought under the command of General George Washington. By April 1777, his unit changed yet again when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and he served in &quot;Smallwood&#x27;s Battalion&quot; until August 1779. He was injured at the Battle of Germantown where he lost a limb.

In August 1779, he left Smallwood&#x27;s unit and served as a Lieutenant Colonel as part of the 7th Maryland Regiment. He retained that position until February 23, 1781, when he resigned.

During his military service, he fought to defend St. George&#x27;s Island, in Saint Mary&#x27;s County, in July 1776 and at other major battles throughout the war, such as the Battle of Brandywine. He served in varied regiments before he resigned as Auditor General within the Continental Army on February 19, 1781.

==State politics==
In 1780, a bill was passed by both houses of the Maryland General Assembly concerning the confiscation of Loyalist property in the state. Forrest was one of the three commissioners, the others being William Paca and Clement Hollyday, to confiscate holdings of such property, which was later apportioned out and sold to certain individuals. He was qualified for that position in February 1781 and resigned by July.

After the war, he traveled to London from St. Mary&#x27;s County and stayed until 1786, when he returned to Georgetown. He returned to Maryland in 1783 to establish a tobacco export business in Georgetown, with business partners Benjamin Stoddert and John Murdock and then returned to London. He was the &quot;resident partner of Forrest, Stoddert &amp; Murdock&quot; 

In 1784, Forrest was admitted as an original member of The Society of the Cincinnati of Maryland. When he learned of its founding, he said:

I cannot express my feelings on reading today, for the first Time, the constitution of the Society of the Cincinnati... though, separated by an Ocean of 3000 Miles, and a slave to Business; there is not one among you, who feel more Affection, for that brave handful, who persevered to the last, than I do.

Forrest was elected to the Maryland State House of Delegates in numerous terms and served from 1781 to 1783, 1786 to 1787, and 1787 to 1790, as a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1796 to 1800, and a State Court Judge from 1799 to 1800.

He represented St. Mary&#x27;s County in most of the 1780s and then Montgomery County and in the Maryland Senate represented the Western Shore of Maryland.

He also served as churchwarden of St. Andrew&#x27;s Parish within St. Mary&#x27;s County (1782-1783), justice in Montgomery County (1799-1800). He owned five black slaves in 1790, which had increased to nine by 1801. In 1800, he had a bounty land warrant for his military service. However, he never occupied the land, which remained vacant.

==Federal politics==
Forrest was also active in politics by representing Maryland as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787. Thomas Jefferson would tell him in a letter from Paris on December 31 that he admired the framers of the Constitution but also was concerned about them sowing the &quot;seeds of danger&quot; by thinking that rulers after them would be &quot;as honest as themselves.&quot;

Forrest would be nominated to be a US senator the following year. All of the people nominated would be Federalists, as he was, he lost to Charles Carroll in the second and third ballot voting by a few votes.

In 1792, he ran for US House of Representatives within the third district of Maryland as a &quot;Pro-Administration candidate.&quot; The Federalist won against the Anti-Federalist William Dorsey, by 669 votes, with most of his votes coming from individuals within Montgomery County, Maryland, and almost 100 more from Frederick County, Maryland, counties that made up parts of the Third District. He would serve as a representative from March 1793 to November 1794, when he resigned. During his time in office, he missed 79.6% of the roll call votes, which is &quot;much worse than the median of 13.0% among the lifetime records of representatives serving in Jun 1794.&quot;

He stayed a &quot;friend and host to George Washington,&quot; cementing his role in the Federalist Party and national politics. However, he still hosted Thomas Jefferson, later a Democratic-Republican, for a dinner in 1790 on his trip to see &quot;the Little Falls of the Potomac River.&quot;

In 1795, Forrest was commissioned a brigadier general of Maryland Militia&#x27;s Fourth Brigade in 1795 and major general of the Maryland Militia&#x27;s First Division from 1795 to 1801. That failed to end his involvement in national politics. In December 1797, he wrote to James McHenry and remarked on his successful efforts to get James Lloyd elected to the US Senate, which filled a vacancy that had been left by John Henry&#x27;s resignation.

==Involvement in founding of Washington, DC==

On October 13, 1790, he would be one of the &quot;original proprietors&quot; of land that was taken for the Washington City. Taking the suggestions of leading Georgetown merchants, suggesting that the &quot;proposed Federal City be on the land opposite Georgetown across Rock Creek&quot; since Georgetown was already a port. Forrest, would sign a document saying the following:

We the subscribers, do hereby agree... to sell and make over by sufficient Deeds, in any manner which shall be directed by General Washington, or any person acting under him, and on such terms as he shall determine to be reasonable and just; and of the Lands which we possess in the vicinity of Georgetown, for the uses of the Federal City, provided the same shall be erected in the said vicinity.

As the historical writer Bob Arnebeck wrote, Forrest would be a major landholder who would buy up land in the area, which would be sold to another speculator, James Greenleaf, and ultimately the federal government. All of the speculators, including Benjamin Stoddert, Robert Morris, and John Nicholson, would make out handsomely from that agreement, with some conspiring with Forrest against other landholders. Ultimately, 15 landowners would negotiate with Washington to &quot;give the government land for the creation of a new federal capital, Washington,&quot; and in 1792, Forrest and James Williams would buy land that would become the National Mall from the State of Maryland and then sell it to the federal government.

Later, in 1791, Forrest would serve served as mayor of the Town of George, now Georgetown, when George Washington met with local landowners at his home to negotiate purchase of the land needed to build the new capital city. The meeting, on March 29, would be attended by landowners of Georgetown, Carollsburg, and others like Washington, agreeing to sell &quot;half of their land within the newly designated 10-mile-square Federal District thus creating a new capital city for the United States of America,&quot; and Pierre L&#x27;Enfant later laid out the plan for Washington City.

In 1796, Ninian Beall would sell a &quot;bluff overlooking the new capital to one Peter Casanave,&quot; who would sell it in two months to Uriah Forrest, &quot;who sold it the next year to Isaac Pollock.&quot; The latter would then &quot;traded it to the over-leveraged Samuel Jackson,&quot; and then Joseph Nourse, Register of the US Treasury under six presidential administrations would repurpose the &quot;modest dwelling as one of two symmetrical wings on a new Federal Palladian mansion, which he called Bellevue.&quot; Also, Forrest would be instrumental in incorporation of &quot;the Georgetown Bridge Company, the Bank of Columbia, and the Georgetown Mutual Insurance Company.&quot;

==Personal life==
On October 11, 1789, at 43, Forrest married Rebecca Plater, of a well-off family deeply involved in State politics, who was born at Sotterley Plantation. They would have seven children.

==Later life==

By 1790, the Forrest family was living next to Benjamin Stoddert, a friend of Forrest, a fellow business partner and Southern Marylander.
 In 1794 Forrest would build a home near Washington, D.C., called Rosedale. It would be closely resembling the architectural style of Mount Vernon, surrounded by stone buildings that had been constructed in the 1740s.

The large-frame house would be located in the Northwest quadrant of Washington, DC. In later years, it would be considered &quot;to be the oldest home in Washington&quot;. The home would become for the Forrest family a respite for Rebecca and their children &quot;from the bustling port city life of Georgetown&quot; and remove them from &quot;impending war.&quot; Throughout the years, the house and its grounds would serve as a &quot;center for political discussions and social entertaining&quot; with the hosting of &quot;a large dinner party for President John Adams&quot; in 1800. Overall, Forrest would exchange numerous letters to Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Alexander Hamilton between 1780 and 1804.

In 1796, Forrest would mortgage &quot;Rosedale&quot; to obtain loans from the state of Maryland to boost the district&#x27;s economy, but by 1802, he would be led into bankruptcy, with Philip Barton Key, his brother-in-law, accepting the mortgage. Key then granted Forrest lifetime use of the property. Forrest also served in a local governmental position in his late life. From 1800 until his death in 1805, he would serve as the clerk of the District of Columbia&#x27;s circuit court.

Forrest died on July 6, 1805, in the parlor of the Rosedale&#x27;s farmhouse and was buried in the Presbyterian Burying Ground in Washington, D.C. His remains were later disinterred, and he was reburied at Oak Hill Cemetery.

At the time of his death, Forrest owned, as noted by now-retired State Archivist for the Maryland State Archives, Edward C. Papenfuse, about &quot;1,680 acres in Allegany, St. Mary&#x27;s, and Montgomery counties, and the District of Columbia, plus ca. 150 lots in the District of Columbia.&quot;

==Legacy==
His estate was &quot;still plagued with debt&quot; after his death and was almost lost &quot;to debts and litigation&quot; but kept in the family for many years to come.

Before her death on September 5, 1843, at &quot;Rosedale,&quot; Rebecca would file for a widow&#x27;s pension from the federal government for her husband&#x27;s military service. In her September 1838 filing, she would be described as a resident of Georgetown who married Forrest in 1789 and it says that he had fought in the Battle of Brandywine. Apart from the pension money granted to Rebecca, $600 per year, his descendants many years later would pursue the same records and wanted to know about Forrest&#x27;s military career. The pension papers of Rebeca would later become the &quot;Rebecca Forrest (the widow of Uriah Forrest) Papers, 1838-1843,&quot; held at the Historical Society of Washington D.C.

In the early 19th century, his home overlooking the Potomac River, in which Forrest lived approximately from 1790 to 1794 would become the home of William Marbury, who is known by the &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; Supreme Court case. In December 1992, it would become the Embassy of Ukraine, in Washington, D.C.

Later, his granddaughter, Alice Green, also lived at Rosedale. She would marry Don Angel Maria de Iturbide y Huarte, an &quot;exiled prince of the Mexican imperial line and a student at Georgetown University,&quot; and have a son named Don Agustín, Prince of Iturbide, the heir of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico and prince of the First and Second Mexican Empires, making Forrest his great-grandfather. His estate would become the Rosedale Conservancy.

Recently, proponents of District of Columbia voting rights have cited Forrest&#x27;s representation of Maryland in the US House of Representatives because he lived within the borders of Washington, D.C.

In 2010, C.M. Mayo would write a novel of historical fiction, &quot;The Last Prince of the Mexican Empire&quot;, which was based upon the &quot;true story of half-American toddler Agustín de Iturbide y Green, a great-grandson of Maryland&#x27;s former governor George Plater and grandson of revolutionary war hero General Uriah Forrest.&quot;

<doc id="1162761" wikidata="Q7338104" url="?curid=1162761" title="Riverchase Galleria">
<text>Riverchase Galleria, locally known as The Galleria, is a large, super–regional shopping mall and mixed use development in Hoover, Alabama, in the Greater Birmingham metropolitan area. It is ranked 43rd on the list of largest shopping malls in the United States. It is the largest enclosed shopping center in Alabama.

Located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 31 (Montgomery Highway) and Interstate 459, the Riverchase Galleria complex includes the region&#x27;s only Costco, and also includes the 15-story, Hyatt Regency, and the 17-story, Galleria Tower office building. The tower includes the headquarters of Walter Energy, Inc. The mall&#x27;s anchor stores are JCPenney, Von Maur, Macy&#x27;s, Belk, and Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s. There are two vacant anchor stores which were once Sears and Belk Children&#x27;s and Home.

==Description==
The Galleria is anchored by 4 department stores: JCPenney, Belk, Macy&#x27;s, and Von Maur. The Galleria has two large parking decks, with several entrances, attached to the mall.

Several restaurants are located on out-parcels including Bonefish Grill, J. Alexander&#x27;s, Stix, and Olive Garden. The Home Depot, FedEx Office, and Costco are located on other out-parcels on the property. There was also a 10-screen Regal Entertainment Group movie theater was on an out-parcel of the property but it was closed in 2006 after the construction of a Rave Motion Pictures (now AMC Theatres) at neighboring Patton Creek Shopping Center. The former movie theater has since been repurposed into an Aveda Salon and Cosmetology school.

==History==
The Galleria was opened on February 19, 1986, by developer Jim Wilson &amp; Associates, initially with four anchor stores — two Birmingham-based chains, Parisian and Pizitz — along with Atlanta-based Rich&#x27;s and national retailer J. C. Penney.

In March 1987, the mall added its first Macy&#x27;s store at center court, the company&#x27;s first store in Alabama. The same year, the Pizitz chain was acquired by McRae&#x27;s and subsequently renamed. In 1995, Parisian expanded its store by almost 66%. In 1996, Sears (which relocated from a nearby location) and a new wing were added, making Riverchase Galleria a total of in size. The expansion made it the largest mixed-use project in the Southeastern United States, and one of the 10 largest mixed-use projects in the United States.

In 2003, the Macy&#x27;s anchor store closed and the Rich&#x27;s location was renamed Rich&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s. The consolidation came 9 years after Federated Department Stores (the parent of Rich&#x27;s since 1976) acquired R. H. Macy &amp; Company. Following the closure of the original Macy&#x27;s location, the store location was sold to Saks Inc., which was the parent of both McRae&#x27;s and Parisian. Saks kept the north wing anchor space vacant for more than a year before reopening the refurbished store in October 2004 under its Proffitt&#x27;s division, giving the company 3 different anchors at Riverchase. On March 6, 2005, the Rich&#x27;s-Macy&#x27;s store (as Rich&#x27;s; along with the location at Colonial Brookwood Village) was officially rebranded as Macy&#x27;s. Later in 2005, Saks sold its Proffitt&#x27;s division — including most of the McRae&#x27;s chain — to Belk. As a result, Saks closed the McRae&#x27;s store. Belk dissolved the separate Proffitt&#x27;s organization, and on March 8, 2006, the Proffitt&#x27;s store at Riverchase became the mall&#x27;s first Belk store. In late 2003, Jim Wilson &amp; Associates (JW&amp;A) sold 50% of the Galleria to General Growth Properties (GGP), which assumed management control.

In 2006, Belk acquired the Parisian store chain from Saks, Inc. The former Pizitz/McRae&#x27;s location simultaneously became available for occupancy. The store had remained vacant since the 2005 closure of McRae&#x27;s as a result of a lawsuit between the Pizitz family, which had retained ownership of the store real estate after its sale in 1987, and Saks Inc., which inherited the lease obligations of its defunct McRae&#x27;s operation. As part of its merger of the Parisian stores into its operations, Belk closed its location in the original Macy&#x27;s space and the Parisian store was renamed to Belk. The upper level of the former Pizitz/McRae&#x27;s has since been converted to a Belk Home &amp; Children&#x27;s Store.

On November 30, 2007, Nordstrom announced plans to open its first store in Alabama in the mall in 2012, in the anchor space first occupied by Macy&#x27;s in 1987, Proffitt&#x27;s in 2004, and Belk in 2006. but the store was never built after plans were canceled in May 2009.

In July 2009, LEGO opened the first LEGO Brand Retail store in Alabama in the mall. The store occupies and became one of the 32 LEGO Brand Retail stores nationwide upon its opening.

On August 6, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location as part of a plan to close 26 stores nationwide. The store closed in October 2019.

In February 2020 the LEGO store closed its location at the Riverchase Galleria. In May 2021, Belk closed its Home and Children location. In January 2022, Macy&#x27;s announced the closure of its store at Colonial Brookwood Village. Thus, the Galleria was not only the first mall in Alabama with a Macy’s but also the last remaining mall in Alabama with a Macy’s. On August 13, 2024, it was announced that Macy&#x27;s location is listed for sale.

===Renovation===
A $60 million renovation, first planned in 2011, was completed in 2013. The renovation plan, including a $25 million sales tax rebate, was approved by the Hoover City Council on October 17, 2011. As part of the renovation, the first Von Maur in Alabama opened in the space vacated by Macy&#x27;s/Proffitt&#x27;s/Belk. The Wynfrey Hotel was renovated and rebranded as a Hyatt hotel, &quot;The Hyatt Regency Birmingham—The Wynfrey Hotel&quot;.

In 2013, Belk announced plans to renovate its store at the Galleria, raising it to the level of a flagship location. Dave &amp; Buster&#x27;s and True Religion both opened at the mall in late 2018.

===2018 shooting===

In November 2018, an altercation resulted in shots being fired and two injured at the Galleria during Black Friday weekend. Following the initial shooting, two officers from the Hoover Police Department approached and shot an alleged suspect, Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., who died at the scene. Although armed during the altercation, it was later clarified that Bradford was not the shooter. Protests were organized by a Birmingham activist group called Justice League, calling for a boycott of the Galleria.

===2020 shooting===
On July 3, 2020, shots were fired near the food court of the mall at 3:18 PM EDT. An eight-year-old boy later died after being shot in the evening. Three others were treated for injuries and hospitalized. On July 5, a 22-year-old suspect was arrested.

<text>The Baule or Baoulé (Baule: &quot;Baule&quot; [ba.u.le]; [bawle]) are a Akan people and one of the largest ethnicities in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The Baoulé are traditionally farmers who live in the centre of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (Ivory Coast), in a French braid shaped region (the Baoule “V”) between the rivers Bandama and N&#x27;Zi. This area broadly encompasses the regions around the cities of Bouaké and Yamoussoukro. The Baoulé have come to play a relatively important role in the recent history of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire: the state&#x27;s first president, Félix Houphouët-Boigny, was a Baoulé; additionally, since the Ivorian cocoa boom of the 1960-1970s, the Baoulé have also become one of the most widespread ethnicities throughout the country, especially in the Southern forests (the &quot;Low Coast&quot;) where they are amongst the most numerous planters of cocoa, rubber, and coffee and sometimes seem to outnumber the local native ethnic groups.

== Kingdom ==

The Baoulé Kingdom was established c. 1730 by Queen Abla Pokou. It lasted as a tribal kingdom until 1893, with the incorporation of the Ivory Coast as a colony of France, making up a part of French West Africa. Its capital being the town of Sakassou in the center of what is now Côte D&#x27;Ivoire, it remains a subnational monarchy in the present day.
==Leisure==
One of the favourite pastimes is the game “Atté,” which is similar to the North American version of marbles: Ivorians utilize nuts, not marbles. An odd number of nuts are placed in a circular pattern in the centre of two opposing teams. The two teams, roughly 30 metres apart, take turns throwing nuts at the circle of nuts. Once a nut has been hit, it is eliminated, and the team that hit the respective nut gains a point. The game ends when all the nuts have been eliminated, and the team with the most nuts at the end of the game wins.

==Religion==

The Baoule religious world consists of three realities :
* Domain of God (&quot;)
* The earthly world: area of human beings, animals and plants, as well as supernatural beings with vast powers who reside in the mountains, rocks, rivers, forests, etc.
* The beyond (&quot;) where the spirits of the ancestors reside

==Ivorian children==

Ivorian children begin aiding their parents with the everyday chores of life at very young ages. As soon as they are old enough, they either carry water from the village pumps or heavy loads of food and firewood to the village market. The boys, when old enough, may even help their father with clearing vegetation.

Like several other groups with Akan origin, Baoulé children are often named according to the day of the week or the circumstances under which they were born. For example, a male born on a Monday would be named Kouassi. However, there are slight variations in the spelling and pronunciation specific to the Baoulé. The Baoulé have a calendar that is different from the calendar of other Akan ethnic groups. This may be due to the circumstances of their departure from Ghana and the need for them to mark a separation with the Ashanti Empire. For ethnic groups such as the Ashanti, Abron, N&#x27;zima, Koffi may be a name for a boy child born on Friday. For the Baoulé, Koffi and Affoué are names for Saturday, the day being Foué. There is, therefore, a sound common to the day and the names.

Baoulé names:

* Frida: Koffi, Affoué; the name of the day is Foue
* Saturday: Kouamé, Amoin; the name of the day is Monnin
* Sunday: Kouassi, Akissi; the name of the day is Kissie
* Monday: Kouadjo, Adjoua; the name of the day is Djole
* Tuesday: Konan, Amlan; the name of the day is Mlan
* Wednesday: Kouakou, Ahou; the name of the day is Ouwe
* Thursday: Yao, Aya; the name of the day is Yah 

Baoule name exceptions

#The third girl or boy in a row is named I&#x27;nsan (often misspelled N’Guessan), independent of the child&#x27;s gender.
#The 9th child is given the name N&#x27;Goran, independent of the child&#x27;s gender.
#The 10th child in the family is always called Brou.
#The 11th child from the same mother is called Loukou.
#The 12th child from the same mother is called N&#x27;Gbin.

===Education===

Education in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire is extremely competitive. Those families that can afford to give their children a private education to assure themselves that their children will receive a formal education. In the public schooling system, to progress beyond certain grade levels children must pass an exam regulated to allow a limited number of passing scores.

Most Ivorian children use a slate to practice their writing and other homework. Small notebooks are also widely available for doing homework and are turned in to be graded. Many homes have a wall with a large chalkboard where children are tutored or practice subjects that they have learned in class. In school, Baoulé children speak only French, but at home they speak their native language of Baoulé. French study begins in grade one.

Handwriting at Ivorian schools is always cursive, never printing.

==Baoulé economy==

With regard to the Ivorian economy, coffee and cocoa are referred to as the chief cash crop. Up until the present day conflict, the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire was the world&#x27;s largest exporter of cocoa. With respect to the local Ivorian economy, resources such as firewood and yams are transported to local markets and sold to other Ivorians or even foreigners. Within the local marketplace, one can find a wide array of goods, including tailored clothing, boiled eggs, popcorn and lingerie.

==Art==
The Baoulé people are talented in African art. Their sculptures are renowned for their refinement, form diversity and the labor they represent. The sculptures do not only include face masks and human figurines, but also include a great variety of work in gold, bronze, and ivory.

Many Baoulé art objects are restricted to be seen only by the individual for whom they were made or by a specific group of people. They are often considered to be powerful spiritual objects. The most powerful spiritual objects are the men&#x27;s sacred masks, bo nun amuin. This mask is a boxy helmet mask representing a menacing animal with bared teeth. Viewing the mask is restricted to men. If a woman or child sees the mask they risk serious injury or death. It is danced in times of trouble to protect the village and at important men&#x27;s funerals. When the bo nun amuin mask is danced it can become very wild and violent. The spirit may chase the men through the village or wreak havoc by destroying things in its path.

Another important art object in Baoulé culture is the blolo bla and blolo bian spirit spouse figures. These sculptures are private objects made for an individual to represent their spirit spouse. Each person has a spirit spouse from the other world, which they were married to before they were born into this world. People make offerings of food and money to their spirit spouse figures to keep them happy because they can influence their relationship with their earthly spouse or other earthly relationships and personal endeavors.

===Masks===

Masks amongst the Baoulé people correspond to several types of dances: the goli, the mblo, the bonu amuen, and the gba gba. The Bonu Amuen is a dance to protect the village from threats and it appears at the commemorations of the deaths of notables. The Baoulé wore a wooden helmet that stands for a buffalo. The type of masks used during the Bonu Amuen are known as &quot;gods of the bush&quot; masks which mostly sit on the forehead of the dancer. These masks depict horned animal heads such as the antelope and buffalo. They are worn with metal ankle bracelets and a raffia cosutme. The snout and/or muzzle of these masks have teeth, representing their belief that a strong animal would defend them. The gba gba is worn at the funerals of women during the harvest season. It commemorates beauty and age. Goli masks can be worn for either entertainment gatherings and/or for the funeral of the high-ranking men of the village. These masks are commonly used in rituals to ward of evil, and cleanse the village of witchcraft. Mblo is a performance category that utilizes face masks in solo dances and skits. These masks resemble refined human faces to portray notable people in the tribe. Mblo masks are one of the Baoule tribe&#x27;s oldest art forms.

==Other economic activities==

* Traditional pagne (also known as Kente cloth)
* Farming

==Baoulé cuisine==

The staple food of the Ivorian diet is the yam. The yam is boiled, and, when cooled, mashed to be eaten. Cassava is also an integral part of the Baoulé cuisine.

Yams, in addition to maize, are stored until they are needed.

Foods other than yams are obtained from the local market. The most important food of the market is fish, wrapped in palm leaves, an economic alternative to wrapping paper. 
Ivorians typically eat meat from goats (chevon), sheep (mutton and lamb), and chickens, which are shared by the entire community. They milk their goats and get eggs from their chickens.

==Baoulé tools==

One of the basic tools employed by the Baoulé populace is the machete. The machete&#x27;s uses can include clearing vegetation or the construction of a paddle or canoe from logs. Another one of the tools employed by the Baoulé populace, is the snail shell, which is used for grounding and pounding tobacco, for the manufacture of snuffs. The Baoulé people are well known for their unique hand woven textiles. The village of Sakiaré consists of 95% population of skilled hand-weavers. The two most notable tools used by the Bauolé people are the shuttle and the beater. The shuttle is a hand made wooden boat shuttle used to in hand weaving to place the weft (horizontal) yarn between the warp (vertical) yarns, interweaving them to create a fabric. The beater is also another hand crafted tool that&#x27;s made from yarn, straw, and yarn. The beater&#x27;s function is to pull the inserted weft yarn from the shuttle forward towards the weaving structure to secure the yarn tightly - creating the fabric.

==Political structure==

The Baoulé political structure is simple; several senior village leaders get together and discuss various issues affecting their village. Each village is ruled by a village-chief (for small villages) or by a queen or a king (for large villages) assisted by some notables or advisers. Queens and kings rarely speak in public, but via a spokesman. Villages were dependent on others to form a canton or a tribe. Each canton is also ruled by a queen or a king. Everyone has a say, even slaves, and everyone was friendly and social. Baoulé political organization is matriarchal and women&#x27;s rights are very sacred.

<text>Delroy Garrett is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Kurt Busiek and George Pérez, the character first appeared in &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 3 #8 (September 1998). The character has also been known as Triathlon and [[3-D Man]] at various points in his history.

==Publication history==
Delroy Garrett debuted in &quot;Avengers&quot; vol. 3 #8 (September 1998), created by writer Kurt Busiek and artist George Pérez. He appeared in the 2007 &quot;&quot; series, by writer Dan Slott and artist Stefano Caselli. He appeared in the 2010 &quot;Atlas&quot; series, by writer Jeff Parker. He appeared in the 2020 &quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot; series, by writer Greg Pak and artist Ario Anindito.

==Fictional character biography==
Delroy Garrett is an Olympic track medalist whose career was derailed when it was found he used steroids. Dejected, Delroy joined the Triune Understanding to restore his faith. Triune leader Jonathan Tremont imbued Delroy with powers stolen from the former superhero 3-D Man. Delroy had no idea of the source of his new powers, thinking that the teachings of the Triune had simply unlocked his superhuman potential. Delroy became the costumed superhero Triathlon and the Triune&#x27;s celebrity spokesman.

Garrett&#x27;s first involvement with the Avengers came while he was using the identity of Triathlon; he assisted them in defeating arms dealer Moses Magnum. Soon after, Garrett also helped the Avengers battle Lord Templar and Pagan at the dedication ceremony of a new Triune Understanding building. The battle ended with Lord Templar and Pagan escaping. Jonathan Tremont publicly blamed the Avengers for the destruction, and then covertly set up a smear campaign against the team to suggest they were religiously intolerant and racist. Tremont then had the mercenary Taskmaster frame a number of Avengers for the destruction of an important Triune building. Tremont then publicly &quot;forgave&quot; the Avengers, which the team grudgingly went along with to avoid further bad publicity. It was during Tremont&#x27;s media event at Avengers Mansion that the building was attacked by a terrorist. Triathlon aided the Avengers in defeating the terrorist. In the aftermath, the Avengers&#x27; government liaison Duane Freeman suggested that the team add Triathlon as a member to quell the bad publicity that the team had recently engendered. With some animosity on both sides, Triathlon was made a member of the Avengers when a new line-up was announced to the public.

At first, Triathlon, although a capable member, constantly complained and argued with his teammates, thinking that they were and included him on the team only because of the public image. But Warbird told him that he could either go around with a chip on his shoulder and never fit in or actually try to work with his teammates as people and take the chance they would be imperfect. Delroy saw that his teammates were good people and became an eager and willing team member, even refusing to attend Triune functions if it conflicted with his schedule with the Avengers.

During Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s war on Earth, a being of immense power entered the Solar System. This was the &quot;triple evil&quot; which Tremont had supposedly founded the Triune Understanding to defeat. Powering up the Triune&#x27;s spaceship, Tremont and the Avengers traveled to face the being. During the battle, Tremont&#x27;s true reasoning became clear: he sought the power of the &quot;triple evil&quot; for his own. In the past, he had stolen the triangle power of 3-D Man, and resurrected his two dead brothers as Lord Templar and Pagan. He then formed the Triune Understanding to enable him to find the other triangle fragments of power. The &quot;triple evil&quot; contained the final power he sought. During the battle, Tremont killed his brothers and his followers by drawing all their power and life energy into himself, intending to take the power of the Triple Evil and use it to become a god to those on Earth, but he ultimately lost control of the immense power. Triathlon, though, was able to channel the power and defeated the &quot;triple evil&quot;, realising that the power could only be controlled by one who strived for others rather than for themselves. With Triathlon now in control of the pyramid, the Avengers then returned to Earth and ultimately defeated Kang and the Scarlet Centurion in their bid to take over the planet. Following Kang&#x27;s defeat, Triathlon dissolved the pyramid&#x27;s remaining energies to prevent it being any further threat, subsequently sacrificing the last of his power to restore the 3-D Man and his brother to their independent forms. When the Avengers later reorganized under a United Nations charter, Triathlon left the team along with some other members.

During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Garrett re-emerged as a member of Captain America&#x27;s Secret Avengers, declaring his stance against the Superhuman Registration Act. He was named among the missing in the wake of the final battle.

Following the Superhuman Registration Act&#x27;s passage, Garrett was recruited in the Fifty State Initiative. Serving as a squad instructor, he assisted in the training of new recruits while training to become a team leader for one of the 50 states. Garrett took on a new alias, 3-D Man, and when his Initiative training was complete he was assigned to Hawaii.

During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Delroy arrives in Hawaii and is greeted by Point Men team members Star Sign and Paydirt. He encounters the Devil-Slayer on the way to the base, who states that he has sensed portents of doom all day. When he meets the final team member Magnitude, the goggles Delroy obtained from the original 3-D Man allow him to identify Magnitude as a Skrull impostor. The Skrull Magnitude (who has the powers of the Banshee, Havok, Polaris and Sunfire) attacks and severely wounds Star Sign and Paydirt, but Delroy kills the Skrull with a sword magically summoned by the Devil-Slayer. The Devil-Slayer uses his Shadow Cloak to teleport Delroy to Camp Hammond, where he announced to everyone assembled that the Initiative has been infiltrated by Skrulls. The Crusader, fearing that he will be exposed as a Skrull, uses the Cosmic Ring, and suddenly 3-D Man sees every non-Skrull surrounding him as a Skrull. The Crusader persuades the 3-D Man to take a Quinjet and get help, but only because it would take him out of range of his ring&#x27;s influence. Mid-flight, the Quinjet is affected by the virus the Skrulls used to infect all Starktech systems, and the 3-D Man crashes somewhere in New Mexico. There, he meets and joins the Skrull Kill Krew after they vanquish the Skrull posing as the She-Thing. He assists them when his goggles identify Blacksmith of the Desert Stars as a Skrull and kills him. Delroy&#x27;s goggles also identify Equinox as a Skrull, who is then killed by Cloud 9. While in Philadelphia, the Revolutionary is revealed as a Skrull and defeated by Gravity and Hope. When they come across a fight between Thor Girl and Ultra Girl, Delroy&#x27;s goggles identify Thor Girl as a Skrull. With help from Gravity, Delroy uses Thor Girl&#x27;s own hammer to kill the Skrull impostor. When it came to a crowd uprising dealing with Skrulls in the form of civilians, Delroy&#x27;s goggles were broken by a thrown rock, giving his allies a hard time finding out which of the civilians were Skrulls. During the struggle, Delroy discovers that he can see who is a Skrull without his goggles. This turns the tides against those Skrulls disguised as crowd members. When it came to the fight at Camp Hammond, Delroy kills a central infiltrator and his Skrull-detecting abilities detect the Crusader as a Skrull after the Crusader kills Criti Noll so Delroy shoots and apparently kills the Crusader.

Delroy leaves the Initiative, noting the hostility of Red Nine, Annex, Geiger, Batwing, and Prodigy over the Crusader&#x27;s shooting, and joins Ryder to hunt for any Skrulls still hiding out on Earth.

Delroy approached the Agents of Atlas in helping investigate strange questions regarding his history and powers. He was later asked to join the team, an offer he accepted.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Delroy is among the heroes recruited by the inverted Doctor Doom to join his team of Avengers.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Garrett is shown to be among the superheroes on the run following HYDRA&#x27;s takeover of the United States. He was apprehended by Deadpool who was working as a member of HYDRA&#x27;s Avengers at the time.

Delroy and the Agents of Atlas are sent by Atlas&#x27; leader Jimmy Woo to a temple in Thailand to rescue Avenger X from General Nurong and his forces. During the mission, the group encounters Nurong&#x27;s master, a dragon named Mr. Thong, who warns them of the upcoming &quot;Clash of Dragons&quot;.

During the &quot;Atlantis Attacks&quot; storyline, Delroy and his teammates are introduced to the New Agents of Atlas by Woo. Delroy, along with Brawn, the Uranian and M-11 are able keep the portal-city Pan&#x27;s portals stable and release the Atlantean dragon Pan had previously captured to power itself, briefly easing tensions between the two nations.

==Powers and abilities==
Delroy Garrett possesses superhuman attributes, such as superhuman strength and speed. He has the ability to identify Skrulls in disguise. He can recover from injuries faster than a regular human being.

Darren Franich of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked Delroy Garrett 53rd in their &quot;Let&#x27;s Rank Every Avenger Ever&quot; list. Rob Bricken of &quot;Gizmodo&quot; ranked Delroy Garrett 65th in their &quot;Every Member Of The Avengers&quot; list. Matthew Perpetua and Daniel Kibblesmith of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; ranked Delroy Garrett 82nd in their &quot;84 Avengers Members Ranked From Worst To Best&quot; list.

==Other versions==
===&quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;===
An alternate version of Delroy Garrett appears in &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;. Triathlon is taken over by Starro the Conqueror. He only appears around the start, where he voluntarily stays at the Mansion to monitor events as he claims Yellowjacket and the Wasp are more experienced. Triathlon is defeated by the Rhino, but being a then-current member of the Avengers, he reappears among the Avengers at the end being transported away from Krona&#x27;s base when the timestream gets realigned and the DC Universe and the Marvel Universes are separated.

<text>A chemical reactor is an enclosed volume in which a chemical reaction takes place. In chemical engineering, it is generally understood to be a process vessel used to carry out a chemical reaction, which is one of the classic unit operations in chemical process analysis. The design of a chemical reactor deals with multiple aspects of chemical engineering. Chemical engineers design reactors to maximize net present value for the given reaction. Designers ensure that the reaction proceeds with the highest efficiency towards the desired output product, producing the highest yield of product while requiring the least amount of money to purchase and operate. Normal operating expenses include energy input, energy removal, raw material costs, labor, etc. Energy changes can come in the form of heating or cooling, pumping to increase pressure, frictional pressure loss or agitation.Chemical reaction engineering is the branch of chemical engineering which deals with chemical reactors and their design, especially by application of chemical kinetics to industrial systems.

==Overview==
The most common basic types of chemical reactors are tanks (where the reactants mix in the whole volume) and pipes or tubes (for laminar flow reactors and plug flow reactors)

Both types can be used as continuous reactors or batch reactors, and either may accommodate one or more solids (reagents, catalysts, or inert materials), but the reagents and products are typically fluids (liquids or gases). Reactors in continuous processes are typically run at steady-state, whereas reactors in batch processes are necessarily operated in a transient state. When a reactor is brought into operation, either for the first time or after a shutdown, it is in a transient state, and key process variables change with time.

There are three idealised models used to estimate the most important process variables of different chemical reactors:
*Batch reactor model,
*Continuous stirred-tank reactor model (CSTR), and
*Plug flow reactor model (PFR).

Many real-world reactors can be modeled as a combination of these basic types.

Key process variables include:
*Residence time (τ, lower case Greek tau)
*Volume (V)
*Temperature (T)
*Pressure (P)
*Concentrations of chemical species (C1, C2, C3, ... Cn)
*Heat transfer coefficients (h, U)

A tubular reactor can often be a packed bed. In this case, the tube or channel contains particles or pellets, usually a solid catalyst. The reactants, in liquid or gas phase, are pumped through the catalyst bed. A chemical reactor may also be a fluidized bed; see Fluidized bed reactor.

Chemical reactions occurring in a reactor may be exothermic, meaning giving off heat, or endothermic, meaning absorbing heat. A tank reactor may have a cooling or heating jacket or cooling or heating coils (tubes) wrapped around the outside of its vessel wall to cool down or heat up the contents, while tubular reactors can be designed like heat exchangers if the reaction is strongly exothermic, or like furnaces if the reaction is strongly endothermic.

==Types==
===Batch reactor===

The simplest type of reactor is a batch reactor. Materials are loaded into a batch reactor, and the reaction proceeds with time. A batch reactor does not reach a steady state, and control of temperature, pressure and volume is often necessary. Many batch reactors therefore have ports for sensors and material input and output. Batch reactors are typically used in small-scale production and reactions with biological materials, such as in brewing, pulping, and production of enzymes. One example of a batch reactor is a pressure reactor.

===CSTR (continuous stirred-tank reactor)===
In a CSTR, one or more fluid reagents are introduced into a tank reactor which is typically stirred with an impeller to ensure proper mixing of the reagents while the reactor effluent is removed. Dividing the volume of the tank by the average volumetric flow rate through the tank gives the space time, or the time required to process one reactor volume of fluid. Using chemical kinetics, the reaction&#x27;s expected percent completion can be calculated. Some important aspects of the CSTR:
*At steady-state, the mass flow rate in must equal the mass flow rate out, otherwise the tank will overflow or go empty (transient state). While the reactor is in a transient state the model equation must be derived from the differential mass and energy balances.
*The reaction proceeds at the reaction rate associated with the final (output) concentration, since the concentration is assumed to be homogenous throughout the reactor.
*Often, it is economically beneficial to operate several CSTRs in series. This allows, for example, the first CSTR to operate at a higher reagent concentration and therefore a higher reaction rate. In these cases, the sizes of the reactors may be varied in order to minimize the total capital investment required to implement the process.
*It can be demonstrated that an infinite number of infinitely small CSTRs operating in series would be equivalent to a PFR.
The behavior of a CSTR is often approximated or modeled by that of a Continuous Ideally Stirred-Tank Reactor (CISTR). All calculations performed with CISTRs assume perfect mixing. If the residence time is 5-10 times the mixing time, this approximation is considered valid for engineering purposes. The CISTR model is often used to simplify engineering calculations and can be used to describe research reactors. In practice it can only be approached, particularly in industrial size reactors in which the mixing time may be very large.

A loop reactor is a hybrid type of catalytic reactor that physically resembles a tubular reactor, but operates like a CSTR. The reaction mixture is circulated in a loop of tube, surrounded by a jacket for cooling or heating, and there is a continuous flow of starting material in and product out.

===PFR (plug flow reactor)===
In a PFR, sometimes called continuous tubular reactor (CTR), one or more fluid reagents are pumped through a pipe or tube. The chemical reaction proceeds as the reagents travel through the PFR. In this type of reactor, the changing reaction rate creates a gradient with respect to distance traversed; at the inlet to the PFR the rate is very high, but as the concentrations of the reagents decrease and the concentration of the product(s) increases the reaction rate slows. Some important aspects of the PFR:
*The idealized PFR model assumes no axial mixing: any element of fluid traveling through the reactor doesn&#x27;t mix with fluid upstream or downstream from it, as implied by the term &quot;plug flow&quot;.
*Reagents may be introduced into the PFR at locations in the reactor other than the inlet. In this way, a higher efficiency may be obtained, or the size and cost of the PFR may be reduced.
*A PFR has a higher theoretical efficiency than a CSTR of the same volume. That is, given the same space-time (or residence time), a reaction will proceed to a higher percentage completion in a PFR than in a CSTR. This is not always true for reversible reactions.

For most chemical reactions of industrial interest, it is impossible for the reaction to proceed to 100% completion. The rate of reaction decreases as the reactants are consumed until the point where the system reaches dynamic equilibrium (no net reaction, or change in chemical species occurs). The equilibrium point for most systems is less than 100% complete. For this reason a separation process, such as distillation, often follows a chemical reactor in order to separate any remaining reagents or byproducts from the desired product. These reagents may sometimes be reused at the beginning of the process, such as in the Haber process. In some cases, very large reactors would be necessary to approach equilibrium, and chemical engineers may choose to separate the partially reacted mixture and recycle the leftover reactants.

Under laminar flow conditions, the assumption of plug flow is highly inaccurate, as the fluid traveling through the center of the tube moves much faster than the fluid at the wall. The continuous oscillatory baffled reactor (COBR) achieves thorough mixing by the combination of fluid oscillation and orifice baffles, allowing plug flow to be approximated under laminar flow conditions.

===Semibatch reactor===

A semibatch reactor is operated with both continuous and batch inputs and outputs. A fermenter, for example, is loaded with a batch of medium and microbes which constantly produces carbon dioxide that must be removed continuously. Similarly, reacting a gas with a liquid is usually difficult, because a large volume of gas is required to react with an equal mass of liquid. To overcome this problem, a continuous feed of gas can be bubbled through a batch of a liquid. In general, in semibatch operation, one chemical reactant is loaded into the reactor and a second chemical is added slowly (for instance, to prevent side reactions), or a product which results from a phase change is continuously removed, for example a gas formed by the reaction, a solid that precipitates out, or a hydrophobic product that forms in an aqueous solution.

===Catalytic reactor===
Although catalytic reactors are often implemented as plug flow reactors, their analysis requires more complicated treatment. The rate of a catalytic reaction is proportional to the amount of catalyst the reagents contact, as well as the concentration of the reactants. With a solid phase catalyst and fluid phase reagents, this is proportional to the exposed area, efficiency of diffusion of reagents in and products out, and efficacy of mixing. Perfect mixing usually cannot be assumed. Furthermore, a catalytic reaction pathway often occurs in multiple steps with intermediates that are chemically bound to the catalyst; and as the chemical binding to the catalyst is also a chemical reaction, it may affect the kinetics. Catalytic reactions often display so-called &quot;falsified kinetics&quot;, when the apparent kinetics differ from the actual chemical kinetics due to physical transport effects.

The behavior of the catalyst is also a consideration. Particularly in high-temperature petrochemical processes, catalysts are deactivated by processes such as sintering, coking, and poisoning.

A common example of a catalytic reactor is the catalytic converter that processes toxic components of automobile exhausts. However, most petrochemical reactors are catalytic, and are responsible for most industrial chemical production, with extremely high-volume examples including sulfuric acid, ammonia, reformate/BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene), and fluid catalytic cracking. Various configurations are possible, see Heterogeneous catalytic reactor.

<text>Zahra Rahnavard (; born Zohreh Kazemi; 19 August 1945) is an Iranian academic, artist and politician. Rahnavard is a university professor, artist, and intellectual who was under house arrest from February 2011 to May 2018. In 2009, Foreign Policy magazine named her one of the world&#x27;s most distinguished thinkers. She is the wife of former Iran Prime Minister Mir Hussein Musavi. In part of her work, she has underlined the need for men to respect the laws of the hijab in the same way as women, as well as a general activist for women&#x27;s rights in the Middle East.

==Early life==
Rahnavard was born in Boroojerd, Iran. Her father Haj-Fathali, was a Sh&#x27;ia and anti-Communist. After hearing of a gathering of Sh&#x27;ia clerics in Iran, Haj-Fathali emigrated to Khomein, Markazi province where Zahra was raised. Zahra Rahnavard earned her bachelor and master&#x27;s degrees in art and architecture from University of Tehran. She also has master&#x27;s and PhD degrees from Islamic Azad University in Political science.

==Career==

Rahnavard was among the early revolutionaries against the Shah. In the last years of the Shah, she was close to Ali Shariati, a dissident Islamist leader. Rahnavard along with former President Rouhani and Mr. Mir-Hossein Mousavi proposed and pioneered the mandatory Hijab, which went into effect shortly after the revolution.

Rahnavard served as the Chancellor of Alzahra University in Tehran from 1998 to 2006 and as a Political Adviser to the former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami. Rahnavard was the first Iranian woman appointed as a chancellor of a university since the Iranian revolution of 1979. She was nominated to this post by former Minister of Science, Research and Technology, Mostafa Moin. After the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 and the purging of reformist officials from the government, Rahnavard was removed (or resigned) from her position as the Chancellor of Al-zahra University in 2006, replaced by Mahboubeh Mobasheri.

As the head of the Women&#x27;s Social and Cultural Council, established in 1989 as one of seven government committees exploring various social issues, Rahnavard has called for these committees to be more equally represented by women members and has been an outspoken critic of the government&#x27;s failure to accord women what, in her opinion, are their legitimate social and civil rights under the Qu’ran.

She was an active member of her husband Mir-Hossein Mousavi&#x27;s campaign when Mousavi entered the 2009 presidential election. Now she is a member of The Green Path of Hope and one of the Opposition&#x27;s Leaders. Rahnavard is also the author of 15 books.

In February 2009 and more than a year after the protests of the Green Movement, Zahra Rahnavard and her husband Mousavi were placed under house arrest by security agents, and all their communications were cut off.

==Personal life==
Rahnavard is the wife of Mir-Hossein Mousavi, the former Prime Minister of Iran and had three daughters: Kokab, Narges and Zahra. She and Mousavi married on 18 September 1969. They are currently under house arrest.

<text>A people meter is an audience measurement tool used to measure the viewing habits of TV and cable audiences.

==Meter==
The People Meter is a &#x27;box&#x27;, about the size of a paperback book. The box is hooked up to each television set and is accompanied by a remote control unit. Each family member in a sample household is assigned a personal &#x27;viewing button&#x27;. It identifies each household member&#x27;s age and sex. If the TV is turned on and the viewer doesn&#x27;t identify themselves, the meter flashes to remind them. Additional buttons on the People Meter enable guests to participate in the sample by recording their age, sex and viewing status into the system.

Another version of the device is small, about the size of a beeper, that plugs into the wall below or near each TV set in household. It monitors anything that comes on the TV and relays the information with the small Portable People Meter to narrow down who is watching what and when.

The device, known as a &#x27;frequency-based meter&#x27;, was invented by a British company called Audits of Great Britain (AGB). The successor company to AGB is TNS, which is active in 34 countries around the globe.

Originally, these meters identified the frequency of the channels - VHF or UHF - watched on the viewer&#x27;s TV set. This system became obsolete when Direct to Home (DTH) satellite dish became popular and viewers started to get their own satellite decoders. In addition, this system doesn&#x27;t measure digital broadcasts.

Before the People Meter advances, Nielsen used the diary method, which consisted of viewers physically recording the shows they watched. However, there were setbacks with the system. Lower-rated stations claimed the diary method was inaccurate and biased. They argued that because they had lower ratings, those who depended on memory for the diary method may only remember to track their favorite shows. Stations also argued that if it wasn&#x27;t low ratings that skewed the diary method, it might also be the new variety of channels for viewers to choose from. Viewers may not be able to record everything they watch and there is no way of discovering the truth. Finally in 1986, Nielsen developed an electronic meter, People Meter, to solve the problem. The People Meter is an electronic method of television measurement that moved from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. The meter also recorded real time simultaneously viewing, reducing memory bias.

Because Audits of Great Britain (AGB) had just entered the U.S. market executing similar technology, Nielsen felt the need to compete. Nielsen made a substantial technological advance before network-era norms entered crisis with transition to the national People Meter sample in 1987. Although People Meters presented substantial improvements over the previous system, the alteration in audience measurement caused significant controversy. The method change costs stations whose audience had been overestimated. The networks firmly disagreed; they pointed out that certain demographics such as young children could not operate the people meter accurately, thus underestimating the number of children watching a particular program. The end of the multi-channel transition was in large part due to the continuous changes in technology and distribution. Nielsen was at a disadvantage as their measuring techniques required burdensome adjustments. Luckily for Nielsen, the advances in advertising strategies, distribution windows, and ways people were using television made industry sectors interested in data about viewing behavior.

==Local People Meter==
Along with changing their counting methods, Nielsen also started emphasizing their sample in 2003 in reaction to census shifts and requests from some industry sectors. Nielsen&#x27;s automated Local People Meter (LPM) technology was introduced in New York and Los Angeles. The LPM improved the method of measurement from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. More importantly, the LPM provides accurate measurements to particular local markets, verse a nationwide sample from the People meter. While diary-based surveys concentrated on quarterly “sweeps” periods, the industry has been pushed towards year-round measurement, due to the automated LPM system.

&quot;Nielsen introduced the LPM as evidence of the rupturing of the network-era business model became broadly apparent, and apprehension about the future of the industry erupted on all sectors. LPM’s more accurately reported full range of what programming viewers watched, including what was observed when channel surfing, in comparison to the diary method it replaced. It allowed Nielsen to maintain established measurement practices, but do them better”.

“While Nielsen’s LPM’s presented next-day demographic analyses on television viewership in major cities, the devices led to accusations of undercounting minorities. A lot of controversy surrounding LPM’s was driven by News Corporation-funded “Don’t Count Us Out” alliance, which exploited activists’ and legislators’ foreseeable mindless reactions to any suggestion of racism” (Lowry, 2004).

==Portable People Meter==

Today there are new systems such as the Portable People Meter and &#x27;Picture Matching&#x27; measuring the viewing habits of TV audiences.
In an effort to improve the accuracy of radio ratings, Arbitron and Nielsen Media Research are testing a &quot;portable people meter&quot; (PPM) for radio. This new device to be clipped to an individual&#x27;s clothing. Radio stations encode an inaudible, unique signal as part of their broadcasts. The PPM &quot;hears&quot; this signal and records the station and the time spent listening. Such a device requires far less effort on the part of respondents.

<text>The [[Jeep]] Gladiator, Jeep Pickup or J-series is a series of full-size pickup trucks based on the large Jeep SJ (Wagoneer) platform, which was built and sold under numerous marques from 1962 until 1988. The Jeep Gladiator/Pickup design is noteworthy for remaining in production for more than 26 years on a single automobile platform generation. The Gladiator was the basis of the first post-war U.S. Army trucks designed to be civilian vehicles and adapted to military use. Numerous versions of the Jeep pickup were built in other markets, including Mexico by Vehículos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) and Argentina by Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA).

The Gladiator nameplate was revived on a midsize pickup truck based on the fourth-generation Jeep Wrangler (JL). It was unveiled at the Los Angeles Auto Show on November 28, 2018.

==Jeep pickup truck history==
The original Jeep pickup truck was the Willys-Overland one-ton 4x4 also available in platform stake, chassis cab, or bare chassis versions manufactured from 1947 until 1965. Several sizes of Forward Control pickup trucks with a cab-over design were manufactured by Kaiser from 1957 through 1966. The first Gladiator pickup trucks were developed by Kaiser in the early 1960s and were continued with improvements through the 1970s by American Motors Corporation (AMC) and also in international markets. The Gladiator-based Jeep SJ full-sized pickup truck models, as well as the compact XJ-based Jeep Comanche pickups, were discontinued by Chrysler after acquiring AMC. Chrysler claimed capacity limitations to manufacture new Jeep pickup models. However, after over 25 years, Jeep reentered the pickup market using the Gladiator nameplate for a four-door midsize truck based on the Jeep Wrangler platform. The new Gladiator is in concept similar to the compact two-door Jeep CJ-8 (Scrambler), a long wheelbase version of the CJ-7 made from 1981 through 1986, but offering more amenities and features.

==Gladiator (1962–1971)==


The first Jeep pickup development mule was operational around May 1960, about three months after the first station wagon-type development vehicle. Introduced in 1962 for the 1963 model year, the Gladiator was a conventional body-on-frame pickup design that shared its basic frame architecture and front end with the Jeep Wagoneer four-wheel-drive station wagon.

Gladiators were available in RWD and 4WD, with optional dual rear wheels. A remarkable innovation was the available independent front suspension (IFS) instead of a solid front axle on the 4WD half-ton Gladiator trucks. It was a simple IFS design with a Dana 44 center section, that proved troublesome, did not sell well, and the option was deleted in 1965.

Gladiator trucks were also available as cab and chassis, wrecker, stake bed, and with chassis-mounted campers with extended wheelbases. The load bed options were Townside, Thriftside (a conventional bed, similar to a Ford &quot;Flareside&quot; or Chevrolet &quot;Stepside&quot;), and flat stake bed, with up to G.V.W. and almost two-ton payload capacity.

A new overhead cam Jeep Tornado engine straight-six producing was standard. It was the first production overhead cam engine in an American light truck or SUV and one of the first OHC engines offered by an American manufacturer.

Further innovations for four-wheel-drive pickups included optional automatic transmission (an industry first), as well as power brakes, power steering, and just like early post-war Jeeps a power take-off for numerous accessories that included snow plows and push plates.

In early 1963, Willys Motors changed its name to Kaiser Jeep Corporation.

During 1965 the AMC V8 engine became available. It produced and of torque at 2600 rpm. The standard Tornado engine was replaced by American Motors&#x27; OHV inline six.

In 1967 all (RWD) two-wheel drive versions, except for the J-100 panel delivery, were dropped due to poor sales.

For 1968, the flared-fender Thriftside models were dropped while a new camper option was added for the J-3600. From 1968 to 1971 Jeep pickups offered the Buick Dauntless V8 as an optional engine.

American Motors Corporation (AMC) purchased the Kaiser Jeep operations in 1970 when Kaiser Industries decided to leave the automobile business. The Jeep trucks moved to all AMC engines to improve performance and standardize production and servicing. The Buick engine was replaced by the or AMC V8s.

In 1970, the Gladiator&#x27;s front grille was changed to the same design as the Jeep Wagoneer SUV. This was the truck&#x27;s first styling change since its introduction. An AMC badge was also added to the grille after 1972.

==Jeep pickup (1971–1988)==


The Gladiator name was dropped after 1972, after which the line was known simply as the Jeep pickup or J-series. The pickups were designated as J2000 and J4000 models (the 3000 series was dropped in 1971) until 1973, then as J10 and J20 models from 1974 to 1988.

From 1971 to 1972 Jeep pickups offered the AMC V8 as an optional engine.

The AMC I6 engine was introduced in 1972 and offered through 1988. The engine produced and of torque.

The AMC 360 cu in (5.9L) was offered in 1971 and through 1988. Producing in early versions and of torque. Later 360s produced and of torque.

Throughout 1971-1972 The J10 received updates to its front-end design which &quot;modernized&quot; the vehicle.

The model designations were simplified for 1974, with the J-2000 and the J-4000, which designate wheelbase, being swapped out for the J-10 and J-20, designating payload capacity. Larger brakes were made standard and the turning radius was reduced. The Quadra-Trac system was now available with all engines.

The AMC was offered from 1974 through 1978. These engines are known for their toughness and excellent power output. The 401 engine produced and of torque.

For 1977, Jeep J-10 pickups included Dana&#x27;s manual four-wheel-drive system, a more powerful six-cylinder engine, and heavier axle tubes, while power front disc brakes became standard equipment and the considerably greater gross vehicle weight rating (GWV) capacity J-20s included AMC&#x27;s V8 engine. The engine was optional, as well as full-time Quadra-Trac and both automatic and manual transmissions.

1983 saw the new full-time four-wheel drive system, Selec-Trac, replace Quadra-Trac.

From 1981 to 1985 a re-bodied version of the J-10 was built and sold as the Jeep CJ-10, featuring a CJ-like nose and cab, as well as a very boxy redesigned rear truck-bed, somewhat resembling that of a Land-Rover.

Chrysler bought out AMC in 1987. The full-size Jeep Pickup line was not only an aging model, but also competed directly with the broader range of Dodge trucks. Chrysler discontinued the full-size Jeep trucks, but continued to build the luxurious and highly profitable Grand Wagoneer, which shared the chassis with the large pickups.

After the Chrysler buyout, the compact Jeep Comanche pickup (based on the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) platform) received only minor changes and its production continued until 1992.

==Military versions==
Military versions of the civilian Jeep pickup included the M715 and M725, built from 1967 to 1969. They were built under contract for nations in addition to the United States. The idea was to reduce costs by starting from a civilian truck and sharing parts with the normal production-line truck, like the later &quot;Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle&quot; (CUCV) for the military as a ton tactical vehicle.

The Swedish Air Force acquired 450 Gladiator vehicles in the early 1980s. They were given the local designations &quot;Klargöringsbil 9711&quot; and &quot;Klargöringsbil 9712&quot;, with the latter variant being equipped with a hard cargo bed top. The vehicles were modified to be used by aircraft groundcrew for mobile flight line operations in the Swedish Bas 90 system and could carry trailers with equipment and tow aircraft. It is often informally referred to as &quot;The Dallas Jeep&quot;.

The Lebanese Armed Forces acquired many M715 and Gladiator SJ versions in the early 1970s, which saw extensive use during the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). Many of these vehicles fell into the hands of the various competing Lebanese militias, who either used them for logistical and transport operations or modified them to be used as technicals, fitted with heavy machine guns or anti-aircraft autocannons.

==Trim packages==

From 1975, Jeep tried making their pickups more &quot;car-like&quot; and appealing to consumers, starting with the Pioneer package, featuring a fancier interior, woodgrain interior and exterior trim, chromed front bumpers, window moldings, and wheel covers, dual horns, and other “car” features.

From 1976 to 1983 the &quot;Honcho&quot; trim package was offered on the J10 pickup. It consisted of bold striping with decals and was offered with factory extras such as the Levi&#x27;s interior or a roll bar. The content of the Honcho package varied from year to year, but &quot;always included the wide-track look of the Cherokee Chief.&quot;

The Honcho was one in a series of special decal packages offered for J-Series trucks in the mid to late 1970s, which included the 1977–1979 Golden Eagle and the 1978 &quot;10-4&quot; version which offered an optional Citizens&#x27; Band radio along with the decals. The Honcho package was only available on the sportside (stepside) and short bed trucks. Between 1974 and 1983 an unknown amount of Honchos were produced, but the Sportside Honchos were made between 1980 and 1983, and only 1264 of these trucks were ever made.

Decal packages were available for many of Jeep&#x27;s vehicles in the 1970s, including a package for the Jeep Cherokee called the Cherokee Chief. The Golden Eagle package was also available for both the CJ and the Cherokee.

The 1980 (1981 model year) Laredo package was perhaps the most luxurious one, including leather bucket seats, leather-wrapped steering wheel, chrome interior trim, and a state-of-the-art Alpine sound system.

== Jeep truck concepts ==
Jeep has shown numerous concept pickup trucks, and officials at the automaker have &quot;expressed interest in putting such a vehicle into production.&quot;

===2003 small pickup truck===
A production-ready version of a Jeep Scrambler pickup was shown in 2003 at the North American Dealers Association, but was pulled after a few hours. According to &quot;Motor Trend&quot;, there might be a &quot;production Jeep pickup truck in the works&quot;.

===2005 Jeep Gladiator===

In late-2004 a new Jeep Gladiator concept was introduced. While not officially intended to be sold, it was used as a demonstration &quot;that a Jeep pickup was in the dark recesses of DaimlerChrysler&#x27;s brain trust&quot;.

The Gladiator concept features an open-air canvas roof, fold-down windshield, removable doors, and an expandable truck bed. The Gladiator has a 2.8-liter, 4-cylinder common-rail turbo diesel engine that provides and of torque. The truck has a 6-speed manual transmission. Ground clearance is , with a break-over angle of 23.2°, an approach angle of 47.6° and departure angle of 38.0°. Front and rear tires are and are mounted on 18x8-inch wheels. The Jeep Gladiator has a payload.

A &quot;midgate&quot; made the concept Gladiator truck closer to an imitation of the Chevrolet Avalanche, &quot;than an attempt to revive its namesake&#x27;s glory.&quot;

The 2005 Gladiator Concept was also a preview of the all-new 2007 Jeep Wrangler (JK) and Jeep Wrangler (JK) Unlimited. These featured nearly identical exterior and interior styling to the production model of the 2007-2017 Jeep Wrangler (JK).

===2012 Jeep J12===
In March, Jeep announced a new concept at the Easter Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah. The J-12 is based on a modified Wrangler Unlimited chassis with a frame extension allowing the use of a load bed. The styling resembles the classic 1960s-era Jeep Gladiator truck and features &quot;old-school&quot; 16-inch smooth steel wheels with 36-inch tires, as well as a full bench seat in the cab.

=== 2016 Jeep Crew Chief 715 ===
At the 2016 Jeep Safari in Moab, Utah, Jeep revealed seven new concepts including a Crew Chief 715 pickup with four-doors and a 5-foot cargo bed. The design was inspired by the Kaiser Jeep M715 military vehicle from the late 1960s that was based on the regular civilian production Jeep Gladiator pickup. The Jeep Crew Chief concept rides on 20-inch beadlock wheels, and 40-inch military tires, but is mostly based on a Wrangler Unlimited stretched to a wheelbase.

<text>The Alliance for Justice (AFJ) is a progressive judicial advocacy group in the United States. Founded in 1979 by former president Nan Aron, AFJ monitors federal judicial appointments. AFJ represents a coalition of 100 politically liberal groups that have an interest in the federal judiciary. The Alliance for Justice presents a modern liberal viewpoint on legal issues.

According to the organization, &quot;AFJ works to ensure that the federal judiciary advances core constitutional values, preserves human rights and unfettered access to the courts, and adheres to the even-handed administration of justice for all Americans.&quot;

==Judicial advocacy==
AFJ launched the Judicial Selection Project in 1985 to monitor the federal judicial appointment system. According to AFJ&#x27;s founder, Nan Aron, the organization wanted to guard against the ideological impact of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s federal judicial nominees. AFJ objects to judicial nominees who oppose abortion or who promise to exercise judicial restraint. The organization provides background on prospective nominees to the American Bar Association and the Senate Judiciary Committee.

AFJ played a role in the defeat of Ronald Reagan nominee Robert Bork&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1987. In 2001, the organization supported the nomination of Roger Gregory, a Bill Clinton nominee and the first African-American judge in the Fourth Circuit in 2001. In 2013, AFJ supported President Barack Obama&#x27;s three nominees for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

<text>Methylecgonine cinnamate is a natural tropane alkaloid found within the coca plant. Its more common name, cinnamoylcocaine, reflects its close structural similarity to cocaine. It is pharmacologically inactive, but some studies funded by anti-drug agencies imply that it is active when smoked. Furthermore, the discovery of differing impurity products yielding methylecgonine cinnamate in confiscated cocaine have led enforcing agencies to postulate that illicit manufacturers have changed their oxidation procedures when refining cocaine from a crude form. Methylecgonine cinnamate can dimerize to the truxillic acid derivative truxilline. Methylecgonine cinnamate is mentioned in patents of active cocaine analogue structures.

<text>Mesatis () was a town of ancient Achaea, in the neighbourhood of Patrae. It is said to have been founded by the Ionians, when they occupied the country. After their expulsion, the Achaean hero Patreus withdrew the inhabitants from Antheia and Mesatis to Aroë, which he enlarged and called Patrae after himself. The city&#x27;s acropolis probably continued to be called Aroë, which was often synonymous with Patrae. In the war between the Achaeans and the Romans, Patrae suffered so severely that most residents left for the surrounding villages of Mesatis, Antheia, Bolina, Argyra, and Arba.

Its site is unlocated. The modern Messatida takes its name from the ancient place.

The &quot;Pócs&quot; in Máriapócs is a derivative of the Hungarian name &quot;Pál&quot;, meaning the name Paul. The prefix &quot;Mária&quot; was added in the 18th century in reference to the shrine to the Virgin Mary in the village.

== Demographics ==
As of 2023, the village had a total population of 1888. As of 2022, the town was 91.1% Hungarian, 6.1% Gypsy, 3.1% Rusyn, and 1.8% of non-European origin. The remainder chose not to respond. The population was 44.9% Greek Catholic, and 16.9% Roman Catholic, and 6% Reformed.

<text>The Wichita Mountains are located in the southwestern portion of the U.S. state of Oklahoma. It is the principal relief system in the Southern Oklahoma Aulacogen, being the result of a failed continental rift. The mountains are a northwest-southeast trending series of rocky promontories, many capped by 500 million-year old granite. These were exposed and rounded by weathering during the Pennsylvanian and Permian Periods. The eastern end of the mountains offers of topographic relief in a region otherwise dominated by gently rolling grasslands.

The mountains are home to numerous working ranches and quarry operations, the state reformatory, recreational homes and campsites, and scenic parklands. Fort Sill, home of the U.S. Army Field Artillery School, occupies a large portion of the southeastern end of the mountains.

==Recreation==
The Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge, a favorite for hikers and rock climbers in the region, is located adjacent to Cache, Medicine Park, Indiahoma, and historic Meers, and is a short drive from Lawton and Walters. Bison, elk and deer are protected on the wildlife refuge. The refuge also manages a herd of longhorn cattle. A scenic highway [Highway 115] traversing the park permits leisurely views of these and other fauna.

Backcountry camping is available in the Charon Gardens Wilderness area. The park is home to a small number of fishing lakes. There are several trails for hiking. The Treasure Lake Job Corps site [now closed] is located here. Additional points of interest include the refuge&#x27;s visitors center, Holy City of the Wichitas, Quanah Parker Lake &amp; Dam, Lake Jed Johnson, and Lake Lawtonka.

Great Plains State Park is located near the geographic center of the Wichita Mountains, north of the town of Mountain Park.

Quartz Mountain Nature Park and Arts Center is a recreation area located north of the city of Altus.

==Geography==
At 2,464 ft (751 m) Mount Scott is the second highest mountain within the Wichita Mountains National Wildlife Refuge boundary. Mount Pinchot in the Special Use Area is taller. A paved road leads to the summit of Mount Scott, offering views of the granite promontories to the west, the wind farm on the Slick Hills to the north, the lakes to the south and east, Fort Sill, and Lawton. The highest peak in the Wichita Mountains (including areas outside the refuge) is Haley Peak, at . Haley Peak is located on private property just outside the northwest corner of the refuge.
==History==
When the area was part of Indian reservations and therefore off-limits to non-Native Americans, the Wichita Mountains were rumored to contain rich gold deposits. When the area was first opened up for settlement, many prospectors staked mining claims, and towns were laid out to serve the presumed bonanzas, but no economic deposits were found. The gold boom was prolonged by some unscrupulous assayers who found gold in every sample, but the miners eventually gave up, leaving behind ghost towns such as Wildman, Oklahoma.

===Overview===

The Wichita Mountains are rocky promontories and rounded hills made of red and black igneous rocks, light-colored sedimentary rocks, and boulder conglomerates. The Wichita Mountains were formed in four distinct geologic episodes following a failed continental rift.
# Magmatism induced by continental rifting just prior to and in the Cambrian Period produced the granites and rhyolites (the red rocks), gabbroic rocks, anorthosites, and diabases (the black rocks). 
# Subsidence resulted in burial by sandstones and carbonates (the light-colored rocks) during the early Paleozoic. 
# Uplift during the Pennsylvanian Ouachita Orogeny brought these rocks to the surface as mountains. 
# Weathering and erosion during the Permian Period flattened the mountains and produced a mantle of conglomerates.

The mountains themselves are Permian landforms covered and preserved by river-borne sediments in the Permian and partially excavated only in recent geological times. Exposure of these fossil mountains is greatest towards the southeast; much of the western part of the Permian range remains buried under sandstones and mudstones.

===Details===
The geologic history of the region began with the deposition of late Precambrian to early Cambrian sandstones collectively known as the Tillman metasedimentary group. These sediments were intruded by a coarse mafic layered complex as the region began to rift apart during breakup of the Neoproterozoic continent, Pannotia. The exposed portion of this unit, named the Glen Mountains Layered Complex, consists of gabbro, anorthosite and troctolite. Recent high-precision dating yields an age of 532.49 ± 0.15 Ma. These are the dark gray rocks found throughout the Raggedy Mountains, the central lowlands region of the wildlife refuge, and to the immediate north of the refuge.

Uplift and erosion followed, as the layered complex is unconformably overlain by the extensive lava flows of the Carlton Rhyolite Group. The rhyolites are a brown-red to orange porphyritic rock with 5–10 mm orange-colored alkali feldspar crystals. Most of the rounded hills on Fort Sill are made of this rhyolite, including Medicine Bluffs. Additional exposure of the rhyolite is found in Blue Creek Canyon, where Oklahoma Highway 58 cuts through the Slick Hills. Tabular intrusions of granite and plutons of hydrous gabbro exploited the boundary between the layered complex and the rhyolites. The granites, collectively named the Wichita Granite Group, vary slightly in composition and texture. The granites form the peaks and highlands in the eastern Wichitas and the isolated peaks of the western Wichitas. Some are equigranular, but most are porphyritic.

The Mount Scott Granite is the most extensively exposed Wichita Granite. It forms the topographic feature from which it takes its name, and it is distributed throughout the northern half of the wildlife refuge. Dark rounded alkali feldspars, typically one centimeter or less in diameter, dominate the porphyritic texture of this rock. SiO2 levels in this granite range from 72.8% to 75.8%.

Relatively small and compositionally distinct plutons, known as the Roosevelt Gabbros, are found in the eastern and central Wichita Mountains. Like the layered complex, these are dark rocks. Unlike the layered complex, they contain appreciable amounts of biotite, a mineral that forms in magmas with elevated dissolved water. One of these bodies, the Mount Sheridan Gabbro, is exposed in roadcuts at Meers and underlies the Mount Scott Granite on the north side of the wildlife refuge. Weathered gabbroic soils are thicker and support more vegetation than those generated on weathered granite, so the tree line on the north side of Mount Sheridan approximates the contact between the Mount Sheridan Gabbro and the Mount Scott Granite. Geologic relationships suggest that the granites and gabbros intruded at depths no greater than half a kilometer in the crust. Minor uplift ensued, and magmatism concluded with the intrusive emplacement of subvolcanic features: rhyolite and diabase dikes. These are poorly exposed, with the exception of a large diabase dike in the Mount Scott Granite revealed during the recent widening of Oklahoma State Highway 49, just west of Interstate 44.

Following the cessation of magmatism, the region subsided and was inundated by a shallow sea, resulting in the deposition of detrital sediments followed by carbonates. The change marks the local expression of the Sauk Unconformity. The light-colored rocks exposed in the Slick Hills are lower Paleozoic marine sediments, and are equivalent to those exposed in the Arbuckle Mountains, 100 km to the east.

During the Pennsylvanian Period (330–290 million years ago) the region was subjected to intense pressure during the continental collision or orogeny which produced the Ouachita Mountains to the east. This resulted in faulting and folding striking along a WNW direction and includes the Arbuckle and Wichita Mountains of southern Oklahoma and the Amarillo Uplift of the Texas Panhandle. Up to of local uplift occurred during this time.

This uplift locally created rugged mountains reduced by erosion to their present state largely during the Pennsylvanian and Permian Periods. Extensive weathering produced the tors of the Charon Gardens region and the &quot;river&quot; of boulders that descends the west slope of Mount Scott. Likewise, weathering produced the bowling-ball sized boulders in the Permian Post Oak Conglomerate locally found in and around the mountains. In addition to outcrops of the conglomerate, the boulders are preserved in the distinctive rock buildings of Medicine Park. As the Permian progressed, river sediments buried the Wichita Mountains, preserving them from further weathering. Recent geological erosion has removed these sediments, excavating these once buried fossil landforms.

The most common soil in the Wichita Mountains is Brico series, which has a topsoil of brown cobbly loam over a reddish brown to red cobbly clay loam or clay subsoil.

<text>Bryan Namoff (born May 28, 1979, in Carson City, Nevada) is an American former soccer player who last played for D.C. United in Major League Soccer.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
Namoff grew up in Rockford, Illinois, where he emerged as a soccer standout at Boylan High School. He played college soccer at Bradley University from 1997 to 2000, where he was a first-team All-Missouri Valley Conference selection in 1999 and 2000, and scored a total of 32 goals and 17 assists while with the team. In 2000, he played for the Rockford Raptors in the USL Premier Development League.

===Professional===
Following his graduation, Namoff was selected 15th overall by D.C. United&#x27;s then-coach Thomas Rongen in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. Namoff made a significant impact as a rookie, registering seven assists in only 15 games while playing in the midfield. However, a change of coaches in the offseason brought Ray Hudson to the team, and Namoff&#x27;s time was significantly curtailed. He appeared in only 11 games in 2002, and spent much of the season on loan with the Richmond Kickers in the USL First Division.

In 2003, Namoff began seeing more playing time for United at right back, appearing in 22 games and registering one assist. In 2004, Namoff locked down the right back position, starting 27 games for the team, scoring two assists. Namoff has continued to be first choice on the right side of United&#x27;s back line ever since. As of the 2006 season, he has also been playing as a midfielder.

In July 2010, Namoff announced he was suspending his playing career after failing to recover from serious concussion.

===International===
Along with teammates Bobby Boswell, Brian Carroll, and Joshua Gros, Namoff made his first (and, to date, only) international appearance for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team on January 20, 2007, against Denmark.

==Honors==

===D.C. United===
* Major League Soccer MLS Cup (1): 2004
* Major League Soccer Supporter&#x27;s Shield (2): 2006, 2007

<text>Interstate 459 (I-459) is a bypass highway of I-59 that is an alternate Interstate Highway around the southern sides of Birmingham, Bessemer, and several other cities and towns in Jefferson County, Alabama. I-459 lies entirely within Jefferson County. This Interstate Highway is about long, and its construction was completed in 1984. I-459 has major interchanges with I-59, I-20, and I-65.

==Route description==

I-459 begins at a trumpet interchange with I-20/I-59 near Bessemer and McCalla. Exit 1, an interchange with Eastern Valley Road, provides access to the large Colonial Promenade shopping center and McCalla community. The freeway then passes under Pocahontas Road and next to the Bent Brook Golf Club before intersecting with Morgan Road at exit 6. Morgan Road connects with Bessemer, Helena, and the western fringes of Hoover along with the Bessemer Airport. After Morgan Road, I-459 enters a much more populated and developed area, namely the large suburb of Hoover. Once interchanging with State Route 150 (SR 150) at exit 10, the highway turns northeastward and widens to 10 lanes. Exit 13 is with US 31, a major suburban route through Hoover, Vestavia Hills, and Pelham. A southbound flyover ramp at this interchange provides direct access to the Riverchase Galleria. The freeway then approaches its interchange with I-65, one of two four-level stack interchanges in the state (the other being its interchange with I-20). After the I-65 interchange, the roadway decreases to six lanes and has a minor interchange with Acton Road at exit 17. As it exits Hoover, I-459 intersects with US 280, an 8- to 10-lane suburban arterial that is one of the most congested roads in Greater Birmingham. The area around this interchange contains many hotels and office buildings. After the US 280 interchange, it turns north and enters a residential area along the Cahaba River, crossing the river twice before passing the &quot;Miss Liberty&quot; (Statue of Liberty replica) and the exit 23 interchange with Liberty Parkway and Overton Road. The highway passes east of Mountain Brook while turning northeast and interchanging with Grants Mill Road at exit 27. After this intersection, I-459 turns northward again as it approaches the suburb of Trussville. The interchange with I-20 is one of two stack interchanges in Greater Birmingham. In its last few miles, the highway intersects with Derby Parkway and US 11 in Trussville before completing its course with an interchange at I-59.

==Future==
===An additional interchange for I-459===
Negotiations between the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) and the city of Hoover are continuing regarding the prospective building of an additional interchange for I-459 at South Shades Crest Road, a heavily traveled traffic artery to help relieve congestion on SR 150. On August 31, 2023, Governor Kay Ivey announced this interchange would add a numbered exit 9, about one mile from exit 10 (SR 150). The project, which is a City of Hoover-led initiative, is expected to cost $120 million.

===Northern bypass===

There are plans to construct another Interstate Highway bypass running north of the Birmingham area to provide another Interstate Highway that would have major interchanges with I-59 (two), I-20 (one), I-65 (one), and I-22, with all of these interchanges being either north or west of Birmingham. This planned Birmingham Northern Beltline has been numbered I-422. This northern bypass of the urban area, if completed, would give Birmingham and Jefferson County a completely ringed Interstate bypass. I-65, I-59, and I-459 are expected to be widened or reconstructed to accommodate the increase in traffic that will come from the construction of I-422.

<text>The Jesusland map is an Internet meme created shortly after the 2004 U.S. presidential election that satirizes the red/blue states scheme by dividing the United States and Canada into &quot;The United States of Canada&quot; and &quot;Jesusland&quot;. The map implies the existence of a fundamental political divide between contiguous northern and southern regions of North America, the former including both the socially liberal Canada and the West Coast, Northeastern, and Upper Midwestern states, and suggests that these states are closer in spirit to Canada than to the more conservative regions of their own country, which are characterized by the influence of Christian fundamentalism in their political and popular culture. The Freakonomics blog opined that the map reflected the &quot;despair, division, and bitterness&quot; of the election campaign and results. &quot;Slate&quot; also covered the image and posited that it might be the reason the Canadian immigration website received six times its usual page views the day after the 2004 election.

==Origin==
The original image was created on November 3, 2004, by G. Webb, a poster on yakyak.org, an Internet message board for fans of the work of Jeff Minter. It quickly became an Internet meme, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as an &quot;instant Internet classic&quot;.

==Geography==
The meme is in the form of a map of the U.S. and Canada which depicts a new hypothetical national border between the two countries. The &quot;blue states&quot; from the 2004 election (New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, the Pacific coast, and the Great Lakes states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) have been merged with Canada to form a single contiguous nation of more than 170 million inhabitants, which is labeled the &quot;United States of Canada&quot;. The remaining &quot;red states&quot; are labeled &quot;Jesusland&quot;. Some versions of the map include Alberta, Canada as part of &quot;Jesusland&quot; due to the province&#x27;s predominantly conservative politics.

<doc id="1162854" wikidata="Q220621" url="?curid=1162854" title="Argentinos Juniors">
<text>Asociación Atlética Argentinos Juniors is an Argentine sports club based in La Paternal, Buenos Aires. The club is mostly known for its football team, which currently plays in the Argentine Primera División, and was recognized as one of the most important football teams of South America by FIFA. It is one of the eight Argentine first division teams that have won the Copa Libertadores. The continental trophy was won in the club&#x27;s first entry to the contest, in 1985.

Nevertheless the most remarkable sign of Argentinos Juniors has been the talented players emerged from its youth divisions, with Diego Maradona as the greatest example of all. This earned the club the nickname &quot;semillero del mundo&quot; (&quot;seedbed of the world&quot;). As a result, it has been described as &quot;one of Argentina&#x27;s most distinctive football clubs&quot;.

==History==

===Early years===

The club was founded in the Villa Crespo neighbourhood of Buenos Aires on 14 August 1904, by a group of anarchist boys that were part of club &quot;Mártires de Chicago&quot; (chosen in homage to the eight anarchists imprisoned or hanged after the 1886 Haymarket Riot in Chicago). Leandro Ravera Bianchi was named president of the recently created club.

The club immediately adopted the red and white colors as an homage to deputy Alfredo Palacios, the first congressman elected from the Socialist Party in Argentina. The club affiliated itself with the Liga Central de Football, a minor league in which small clubs and companies took part of. The first match played by Argentinos Juniors was against Club La Prensa, which Argentinos Juniors lost by a catastrophic scoreline of 12–1. Nevertheless, the squad would be crowned champion at the end of the season. Argentinos Juniors played its home matches in the field located on Gaona Avenue and Añasco Street.

After the club was evicted, Argentinos Juniors played at several fields, first renting one in Villa Ballester, returning to their neighborhood of origin in 1907. After a brief stint in Villa Urquiza, the club returned to Caballito, later moving to Fraga and Estomba streets in Villa Ortúzar. In 1909, Argentinos gained affiliation with the Argentine Football Association, but in 1912 the club was involved in the first schism in Argentine football when Argentinos joined the breakaway &quot;Federación Argentina de Football&quot; (FAF). During those years, the club re-adopted its green and white colors as there were teams in the league using red jerseys.

In 1920, the Argentinos Juniors played a promotion play-off with El Porvenir, which saw El Porvenir prevail 3–2 on aggregate. In 1921, the team secured promotion to the Argentine top division, making its debut in the 1922 season, where Argentinos finished 6th.

In 1925, the Argentinos Juniors moved to its current location in La Paternal neighborhood, acquiring land at San Martín Avenue and Punta Arenas Street and building a stadium with a capacity of 10,000. With the new stadium finished, Argentinos Juniors was runner-up in 1926 behind champions Boca Juniors. The club had also increased its membership to 1,000.

In 1927, the two separate football associations were reunified and Argentinos played in a massive 34 team league. Later, the league was expanded to 36 and Argentinos managed to keep its place until 1930.

===1931–1966===
In 1931 Argentinos joined 17 other clubs in forming a breakaway professional league, a move that marked the beginning of the professional era of Argentine football. In 1934 the amateur league was broken up and Argentina once again had a unified first division. As part of this move, Argentinos Juniors were unified with Club Atlético Atlanta, the season progressed badly, and after 25 rounds the union was dissolved due to financial irregularities in the Atlanta books. Argentinos Juniors played on but finished bottom of the league with only 2 wins from 39 games.

Argentinos was allowed to keep its place in the Primera, but succumbed to relegation in 1937 after finishing second from bottom of the table.
In 1940 Argentinos enjoyed a good campaign in a new stadium, which ended up in winning the 2nd division, but the club was not allowed promotion because their ground did not meet the requirements of the Primera División, and AFA would not make an exception for Argentinos to play at another ground, even though they had done so for several other promoted clubs in previous seasons.
In 1943 Hector Ingunza started playing for the club, and went on to become the top scorer in the club&#x27;s history with 143 goals in official games between 1943 and 1946.

In 1948 Argentinos suffered another injustice at the hands of the AFA. They had qualified to the end of season playoff for promotion to the Primera and were top of the league after 7 of the 11 rounds when a players strike interrupted the competition. AFA eventually abandoned the playoff and gave automatic promotion to the teams that had been relegated in 1946 and 1947 instead.

In 1954 Argentinos finished 2nd in the league having scored 88 goals, making it the highest scoring team by far. In 1955 the team finally secured promotion back to the Primera after 18 long years. Argentinos returned to top flight competition in 1956 and after finishing near the bottom of the table that year, the team secured comfortable mid-table finishes over the next few seasons.

In 1960 there was a complete overhaul of the Argentinos Juniors team. The new team performed well and it was only in the last game of the season that they missed out on the championship. Argentinos finished in 3rd place, only 2 points below the eventual champions Independiente. Although the team didn&#x27;t win the championship, it is fondly remembered by those old enough to have seen them play. In the following years the team did not live up to expectations, rarely finishing in the top half of the table.

===1967–1984===
1967 saw the introduction of the Metropolitano and Nacional system, Argentinos struggled to adapt and only just survived relegation from the Metropolitano in the inaugural season. Over the next few seasons Argentinos had to play in several short tournaments to earn the right to stay in the Metropolitano and were far from qualifying to play in the Nacional.

From 1971 Argentinos stabilized themselves and avoided the lower positions in the table, they also qualified to play in the expanded Nacional tournaments of the early &#x27;70s, they performed well enough, but failed to qualify for the final stages. In 1975 Argentinos Juniors finished 19th of 20 teams, but were fortunate in that no teams were relegated from the Metropolitano that season.
On Thursday 20 October 1976, fans of Argentinos Juniors and a few traveling Talleres de Córdoba fans witnessed probably the most important debut in the history of Argentine football. With Argentinos losing 1–0 the manager, Juan Carlos Montes sent on a fifteen-year-old debutant named Diego Armando Maradona making him the league&#x27;s youngest ever player until his record was broken by Sergio Agüero in 2003. Argentinos lost the game but Diego went on to propel the club forward over the next four years and to achieve great successes with other clubs and the Argentina national team. In the 1979 Metropolitano Diego became the youngest topscorer in the history of Argentine football with 14 goals, he went on to become top scorer in the following three tournaments, matching José Sanfilippo&#x27;s record of being Argentina&#x27;s topscorer on four consecutive occasions. In 1980 Argentinos finished 2nd in the Metropolitano and reached the quarter finals of the Nacional. The 2nd-place finish was their best since the beginning of the professional era in 1931.

Maradona was sold to Boca Juniors in 1981 for a fee of £1 million. Maradona never won a title with Argentinos but his massive transfer fee allowed Argentinos to strengthen their squad for the years ahead, although his departure almost cost Argentinos their place in the top flight as they needed a last day win over San Lorenzo to avoid relegation at San Lorenzo&#x27;s expense.

In 1982 Argentinos failed to progress to the latter stages of the Nacional and finished in mid table in the Metropolitano. The season of 1983 saw a distinct improvement under the leadership of Ángel Labruna, he had brought in a new group of players a new system of play and moved them to the Estadio Ricardo Etcheverry of Ferro Carril Oeste to give the team a wider pitch to play on. The team were making good progress, they had made it to the semi-finals of the Nacional and were in the middle of the Metropolitano when Labruna died suddenly on 20 September 1983, the team held themselves together under new manager Roberto Saporiti for a mid table finish. They then made it to the quarter-finals of the Nacional in 1984.

===1984–1985: First titles and Copa Libertadores===

Saporiti had kept faith with Labruna&#x27;s attacking style of play, and largely retained the same group of players. Argentinos managed to win the title by a single point over Ferro Carril Oeste on the last day of the season. This was the first major title in the club&#x27;s history and gave them automatic qualification to the Copa Libertadores in 1985.

Saporiti was replaced as manager by José Yudica who had worked wonders in previous seasons including leading unfashionable Quilmes Atlético Club to the Metropolitano championship in 1978 and rescuing San Lorenzo from the 2nd division at the first time of asking. The Nacional championship of 1985 was the last, and featured by far the most complicated structure in the history of the Argentine Primera. Once the competition reached the knockout stage, the eliminated teams got another chance to play on in the losers knockout. Argentinos won the winners group with a 4–2 penalties win against Vélez Sársfield after a 2–2 aggregate score, but Velez got another chance to play for the title after beating River Plate in the losers final. Argentinos and Velez played for the title and after a 1–1 draw, Velez won the penalty shootout, but because they had come from the losers group a new game was needed, which Argentinos won 2–1.
The 1985 edition of the Copa Libertadores saw the inclusion of three Argentine teams, Independiente as the previous years champions, Ferro Carril Oeste as the champions of the 1984 Nacional and Argentinos Juniors as the champions of the 1984 Metropolitano.

In the first round Argentinos and Ferro were put into the same group with Brazilian teams Fluminense and Vasco da Gama. The group was dominated by the two Argentine teams, who finished level on points at the top of the group. This necessitated a playoff game to determine which team would progress to the semi-final, which Argentinos won 3–1.

In the semi-final round Argentinos found themselves in a group of three with Independiete who had received a bye to the semi-finals and club Blooming of Bolivia. Argentinos progressed thanks to a 2–1 win in Independiente&#x27;s stadium in the last fixture of the group.

The final was against América de Cali of Colombia, after a 1–0 home win each, the final went to a deciding game in Asunción, Paraguay. The game finished 1–1 and Argentinos won 5–4 on penalties. It was only the second time the competition had been decided on penalties, and marked the finest achievement in the history of Argentinos Juniors.

The usual line-up was: Enrique Vidallé, Carmelo Villalba, José Luis Pavoni, Jorge Olguín, Adrián Domenech, Emilio Commisso, Sergio Batista, Mario Videla, &quot;Pepe&quot; Castro, Claudio Borghi, Carlos Ereros. The team was coached by José Yudica.

===Decline===
In 1985 Argentinos Juniors represented South America in the Intercontinental Cup against Juventus FC of Italy, the game ended in a 2–2 draw, but Argentinos lost in the penalty shootout. Argentinos went on to win another trophy in 1986. They won 1–0 in the Copa Interamericana against Defence Force of Trinidad and Tobago.

Argentinos qualified for the 1986 Copa Libertadores, receiving a bye to the second round as holders, but was eliminated in the group of three, behind River Plate of Argentina who went on to win the tournament.

1985–1986 saw the start of European-style seasons. Argentinos performed well, finishing in the top half of the table for most of the rest of the 1980s and never fearing relegation, although Argentinos also never really challenged as title contender. By 1988 the majority of the Libertadores champions had gone and Argentinos were a vastly different team.

On 20 November 1988 the club set a world record for the longest penalty shootout, which occurred in a league match against Racing Club, the shootout finished 20–19 to Argentinos after 44 penalties were taken. The rules of the time granted an extra point for the winner on penalties after a drawn match.

1990 saw the introduction of the Apertura and Clausura system in Argentina, Argentinos enjoyed a number of decent finishes, although the team finished 19th in Apertura 1992 and was saved from relegation by the points averaging system.

===Relegation and return to Primera===
Argentinos finished 20th and last in 1995 Clausura and was again saved by the points averaging system, the next year squad finished bottom of the Clausura and was relegated from the Primera División only eleven years after being champions of South America.

In the 1996–1997 season Argentinos won the second division under manager Osvaldo Sosa to bounce back into the Primera at the first attempt. The team remained in the top flight until it was relegated again after another sequence of poor finishes. The best finish Argentinos managed in that period was 4th in the 2001 Clausura.

Argentinos spent two seasons in the 2nd division before returning in 2004 through a playoff with Talleres de Córdoba who had finished the season in 3rd place in the Primera, but had to play in the relegation playoff due to effect of their poor form in the previous 2 seasons on their standings in the points averaging table.

Argentinos spent a couple of nervous seasons narrowly avoiding relegation in 2005 by beating Atlético de Rafaela in a playoff. The following season it survived a playoff against Huracán. The 2006–2007 season saw Argentinos finally claw its way clear from the relegation places after over two years of flirting with relegation.

In 2008 Argentinos earned the right to play in an international tournament for the first time in 12 years by qualifying for the Copa Sudamericana 2008. The team eventually progressed to the semi-final where it was eliminated by Estudiantes de La Plata over two legs despite beating them 5–0 in the league game which was sandwiched between the cup ties.

In June 2009, former star player Claudio Borghi took over as manager of the club following a poor performance in the 2009 Clausura tournament where the club had finished 20th and last in the table with only 2 wins from their 19 games.

At the beginning of the Clausura 2010 championship, Argentinos set itself the target of matching or improving on the 61 points from the 2007–08 season to avoid dropping further down the relegation table.

The team recorded an impressive 6–3 win against Lanús in its second fixture of the campaign, but after 5 games this would be its only victory, with two draws and two defeats. Argentinos won its 6th fixture against Estudiantes de La Plata which was the start of a 14-game unbeaten streak that saw Argentinos finish 1-point ahead of Estudiantes at the end of the season. The most significant result in this 14-game run was in the penultimate fixture against title challengers Independiente, which saw Argentinos come back from 1–3 down to win 4–3, which featured two goals in the final minutes of the game to seal the win and leave Argentinos at the top of the table with one game to play. Argentinos finally won its first domestic championship in 25 years with a 1–2 away win against Huracán in the Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó.

In April 2014, they were relegated to the Primera B Nacional.

Although the red color has been historically identified with Argentinos Juniors, the first jersey was green with white vertical stripes. Some sources state that this jersey was worn during the first years of the team because the Argentine Football Association did not allow Argentinos Juniors to register a red uniform due to it having been previously adopted by Club Atlético Independiente.

<text>Benzoylecgonine is the main metabolite of cocaine, formed by the liver and excreted in the urine. It is the compound tested for in most cocaine urine drug screens and in wastewater screenings for cocaine use.

==Biochemistry and physiology==
Chemically, benzoylecgonine is the benzoate ester of ecgonine. It is a primary metabolite of cocaine, and is pharmacologically inactive. It is the corresponding carboxylic acid of cocaine, its methyl ester. It is formed in the liver by the metabolism of cocaine by hydrolysis, catalysed by carboxylesterases, and subsequently excreted in the urine. It is readily synthesised by boiling cocaine freebase in water.

==Urinalysis==
Benzoylecgonine is the compound tested for in most substantive cocaine drug urinalyses. 

==Presence in drinking water==
Benzoylecgonine is sometimes found in drinking water supplies. In 2005, scientists found surprisingly large quantities of benzoylecgonine in Italy&#x27;s Po River and used its concentration to estimate the number of cocaine users in the region. In 2006, a similar study was performed in the Swiss ski town of Saint-Moritz using wastewater to estimate the daily cocaine consumption of the population. A study done in the United Kingdom found traces of benzoylecgonine in the country&#x27;s drinking water supply, along with carbamazepine (an anticonvulsant) and ibuprofen (a common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug), although the study noted that the amount of each compound present was several orders of magnitude lower than the therapeutic dose and therefore did not pose a risk to the population.

Preliminary studies on ecological systems show that benzoylecgonine has potential toxicity issues. Research is being conducted on degradation options such as advanced oxidation and photocatalysis for this metabolite in an effort to reduce concentrations in waste and surface waters. At environmentally relevant concentrations, benzoylecgonine has been shown to have a negative ecological impact.
