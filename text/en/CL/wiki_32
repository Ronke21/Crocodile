<text>Road Trip is a 2000 American road sex comedy film directed by Todd Phillips (in his directorial debut) and written by Scot Armstrong and Phillips. The film stars Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Paulo Costanzo, and DJ Qualls, with Amy Smart, Tom Green, Rachel Blanchard, and Fred Ward in supporting roles. The film follows Josh Parker (Meyer), who enlists three of his college friends to embark on an road trip to retrieve an illicit tape mistakenly mailed to his girlfriend, Tiffany (Blanchard).

Released theatrically on May 19, 2000, &quot;Road Trip&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing $119.8 million worldwide. The film has gathered a cult following over the years. A direct-to-video sequel, titled &quot;Beer Pong&quot;, was released on August 11, 2009, with Qualls reprising his role.

==Plot==
Josh Parker and Tiffany Henderson are childhood friends turned high-school sweethearts, and try for a long-distance relationship as he goes to the University of Ithaca and she goes to the University of Austin. Josh becomes insecure when he cannot regularly reach Tiffany by the phone. Fearing infidelity, Josh begins sending Tiffany video-taped messages.

Josh asks his friend and roommate Rubin to mail his latest tape to Tiffany before leaving for his Ancient Philosophy class. Josh&#x27;s Ancient Philosophy professor tells him he needs a B+ on his mid-term to pass the class. Josh&#x27;s best friend, E.L., convinces Josh to stop worrying about Tiffany and notice the beautiful Beth Wagner. Beth is in love with Josh, much to the chagrin of Jacob, a self-absorbed Ancient Philosophy T.A. who is obsessed with her. Later, E.L. throws a party where he auctions off several female students, including Beth. Scared of Jacob, she convinces Josh to outbid him. Josh and Beth escape to his room and record themselves having sex on his camcorder.

The next morning, Josh tells his friends that he slept with Beth and recorded it. Josh&#x27;s friends immediately play his camcorder tape expecting to see Josh and Beth having sex, only to find love letters and songs performed for Tiffany. Josh believes that Rubin mailed the sex tape to Tiffany. Josh then hears a voicemail from Tiffany saying that she has not called due to the death of her grandfather. With E.L. and Rubin, Josh asks shy loner Kyle to tag along on a road trip to Austin, as he needs his car, owned by Kyle&#x27;s strict father, Earl.

After leaving the interstate in Bedford for what they thought was a &quot;shortcut&quot;, they find a small bridge collapsed, realizing they will waste five hours backtracking. E.L. and Rubin convince them to jump the gap. Kyle objects but they proceed. They make it across, but the car is wrecked, destroying Josh&#x27;s philosophy textbooks. They continue on foot, stopping at a motel. Rubin tries to buy marijuana from the unsympathetic motel clerk, but is informed that Kyle&#x27;s credit card is maxed out. Looking for transportation, E.L. persuades a blind woman, Brenda, at a school for the blind, into letting him take a bus for &#x27;repairs&#x27;, and they resume the journey.

After a series of misadventures, the group finally gets to Austin and Tiffany&#x27;s dorm, Josh intercepts the tape, just as she arrives. Earl also bursts in, furious over the car and the credit card, threatening to drag Kyle back with him. Kyle finally stands up to him, stating that he is going back to school with his friends. Earl assaults him and a mini-riot ensues.

Josh and Tiffany retreat to talk, then Beth calls to warn him about his midterm. While Josh talks on the phone, Tiffany starts to watch the tape, which luckily is nothing but Barry mooning the camera. She and Josh amicably break up. Josh and his friends return to Ithaca just in time to take his midterm – with a little help from Beth, who called in a bomb threat.

Josh passes the philosphy course and begins a relationship with Beth (happily making videos); Jacob eventually dies as a result of leading a cult staging a mass suicide, which no one but himself carried out; Rubin becomes a successful marijuana cultivator; E.L., inspired by his sperm donation, begins dating a pre-med student; and Kyle starts dating Rhonda and reconciles with Earl.

Filming took place from October 16, 1999 to December 27, 1999 on the campuses of Woodward Academy, Georgia Tech, Emory University, and the University of Georgia. The university seen in a flyover in the opening scene is actually Harvard University; the same footage was later used in the film &quot;Old School&quot; in 2003. The diner scene was shot in Lawrenceville, Georgia at the Gwinnett Diner, as it says on the coffee mugs. One of the final scenes of the tour was filmed at Founders Park at the University of Southern California.

<doc id="1164538" wikidata="Q606467" url="?curid=1164538" title="Darkness Falls (2003 film)">
<text>Darkness Falls is a 2003 supernatural horror film written by Joe Harris, James Vanderbilt and John Fasano and directed by Jonathan Liebesman, in his feature directorial debut. The film stars Chaney Kley and Emma Caulfield. It follows Kyle Walsh (Kley), who witnesses his mother&#x27;s murder at the hands of a vengeful spirit lynched by an angry mob more than 150 years ago. Twelve years later, Kyle returns to his childhood home because Michael Greene (Lee Cormie), the young brother of his romantic interest Caitlin (Caulfield), is being stalked by the same spirit. Kyle must protect them from this powerful enemy and put an end to its killing spree. Released on January 24, 2003, it was critically panned, but was considered a commercial success, grossing $47.5 million against a $11 million budget.

==Plot==

In the middle of the 19th century, in the town of Darkness Falls, elderly widow Matilda Dixon was adored by the town&#x27;s children. She would give them a gold coin whenever they lost a tooth, earning her the nickname Tooth Fairy. One night, a fire broke out in her house and left her face disfigured and severely sensitive to light. She wore a white porcelain mask and would only leave her house at night. However, the town&#x27;s adults were suspicious of Matilda, believing her to be a witch. When two children went missing, the town quickly turned on Matilda. They tore off her mask, exposed her face to light and hanged her. Before her death, Matilda placed a curse on the town and swore revenge. &quot;What I took before in kindness, I will take forever in revenge&quot;. When the two missing children returned home unharmed, the town realized their mistake and quickly buried Matilda&#x27;s body, keeping their deed a secret. Over the next 150 years, the story of Matilda became the legend of the Tooth Fairy. Her spirit visits children on the night they lose their last baby tooth. If anyone lays eyes upon her, they will face her curse and be killed.

In 1990, Kyle Walsh, a teenager befriended by Caitlin Greene, loses his last baby tooth. That night, he wakes after a horrific nightmare and senses Matilda&#x27;s presence, discovering that the story is true. Knowing she cannot bear the light, he shines a flashlight into her face and flees. Hiding in the brightly lit bathroom. His mother tries to reassure him that there is nobody else in the house but is killed after seeing Matilda in Kyle&#x27;s room. The next morning, police arrive and Kyle is removed to a psychiatric institution after mistaken speculations that he killed his mother.

Twelve years later, Caitlin telephones Kyle to ask for his help with her younger brother Michael, who refuses to sleep in the dark. Kyle still suffers extreme paranoia from his encounter with Matilda. He has dozens of flashlights and numerous medications for anxiety, depression and sleep disorders. Kyle visits Michael at the hospital but denies any relation to his condition and walks away from Caitlin. She still believes that the legend of Matilda Dixon is just a story, one which they were all told as children but a story nonetheless.

Kyle tries to warn others of Matilda but faces ridicule and skepticism which leads to the death of many townspeople for not believing him. A lightning storm blacks out the whole town. Realizing that Michael and Caitlin are in danger, Kyle rushes to the hospital. He rescues them and gains allies along the way, as others see Matilda and realize the story is true. Kyle, Michael and Caitlin flee and hide in the lighthouse. They are helped by several medical personnel and a police officer, all of whom are killed by Matilda.

During his final confrontation with Matilda, power is restored and the lighthouse beacon is activated. The sudden exposure to light causes Matilda excruciating pain and Kyle tears off her mask. Seeing her grotesque, disfigured face, he realizes she is now vulnerable. Enraged, she resumes her attack. Kyle sets his right sleeve on fire and he strikes her face with it. As her spirit is engulfed in flame, Matilda is destroyed and her curse is finally brought to an end.

In a final scene, a young boy is being tucked into bed by his parents, having just lost his last baby tooth. As he sleeps, his mother replaces the tooth under his pillow with some gold coins.

==Production==
In September 2001, the film was announced as having entered development under the working titles of &quot;Don&#x27;t Peek&quot; and &quot;The Tooth Fairy&quot; as the first production of the Revolution Studios based Distant Corners Entertainment Group, which itself was expanded from a 2001 short film &quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; written and directed by Joe Harris. Filming was slated to begin in November of that year with production in Australia on a $6–8 million budget. Jonathan Liebesman was announced as director in what would be his debut feature. Producer John Hegeman, who was behind the marketing of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, voiced his hopes that the film would be the first in a wide reaching franchise.

===Post-production===
Initially, the film was to have established Kyle Walsh as more explicitly troubled while keeping the actual existence of the Tooth Fairy vague and undefined in order to make audiences question whether Kyle was the killer. Matilda Dixon was also established as being a younger widow with a husband who was lost at sea rather than an older woman as depicted in the final film. After completion, the producers heavily truncated the final cut removing character backstory as well as expanded details on the Darkness Falls curse and made the film much more upfront and explicit with the Tooth Fairy as the main antagonist rather than any suggestion that Kyle may be the killer.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s closing credits feature the song &quot;Gunboat&quot; by Vixtrola. Other songs featured in the film include &quot;Look Out Below&quot; by Closure, &quot;Hand of Emptiness&quot; by Brian Tichy, and &quot;Rock Nation&quot; by Scott Nickoley and Jamie Dunlap. 
==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Darkness Falls&quot; debuted at number one its opening weekend. Grossing $32,551,396 domestically and $47,488,536 worldwide, &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; was considered a commercial success at the U.S. box office, recouping its $11 million budget.

=== Critical response ===
According to review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, 10% of critics out of 132 reviews gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 3.2/10; the critical consensus is: &quot;A derivative movie where the scares are few and things don&#x27;t make much sense&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 23 out of 100, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;, based on reviews from 27 critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden called the film &quot;an efficient little horror movie that doesn&#x27;t waste its time getting down to business.&quot; Although the film had a &quot;deliberate sparseness of gore,&quot; Holden noted the &quot;demonization of a benign childhood phantom&quot; as the film&#x27;s &quot;cleverest notion.&quot; Jamie Russell of the BBC gave it 3/5 stars, writing: &quot;This is a self-consciously silly, completely disposable multiplex movie that does its best to deliver its fair share of chills while struggling to keep a straight face.&quot;

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that although &quot;the filmmakers and their cast strive mightily to work up some thrills and chills,&quot; the film ultimately was &quot;not all that scary.&quot; Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; called it &quot;a mish mash of horror-movie clichés&quot;. Alexander Walker of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; wrote: &quot;Bogey-fanciers may enjoy it; others may want to check out long before they all take refuge in the lighthouse.&quot;

==Novelization==
Joe Harris wrote &quot;Darkness Falls: The Tragic Life of Matilda Dixon&quot;, a prequel comic, which was published by Dark Horse Comics. Keith R. A. DeCandido wrote a novelization of the film, which was published by Pocket Books in December 2002.

<text>Mamphela Aletta Ramphele (; born 28 December 1947) is a South African politician, anti-apartheid activist, medical doctor and businesswoman. She was a partner of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, with whom she had two children. She is a former vice-chancellor at the University of Cape Town and a former managing director at the World Bank. Ramphele founded the political party Agang South Africa in February 2013 but withdrew from politics in July 2014. Since 2018, she has been the co-president of the Club of Rome.

== Early life ==
Ramphele, a Mopedi, was born in the Bochum District in Northern Transvaal (now Limpopo). She completed her schooling at Setotolwane High School in 1966 and subsequently enrolled for pre-medical courses at the University of the North. Her mother, Rangoato Rahab, and her father, Pitsi Eliphaz Ramphele were primary school teachers. In 1944, her father was promoted as headmaster of Stephanus Hofmeyer School. Ramphele contracted severe whooping cough at the age of three months. The wife of the local church minister, Dominee Lukas van der Merwe, gave her mother medical advice and bought medicines for the sick child that saved her life.

In 1955, Ramphele witnessed a conflict between a racist Afrikaner church minister and the people of the village of Kranspoort. This contributed to her political awakening.

== Education ==
Ramphele attended the G. H. Frantz Secondary School but in January 1962 she left for Bethesda Normal School, a boarding school which was part of the Bethesda teachers training college. In 1964, she moved to Setotolwane High School for her matriculation where she was one of only two girls in her class. On completion of her schooling in 1966, in 1967, Ramphele enrolled for pre-medical courses at the University of the North. In 1968, she was accepted into the University of Natal Medical School, then the only institution that allowed black students to enrol without prior permission from the government. Her meagre financial resources meant that she was forced to borrow money to travel to the Natal Medical School (now the Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela Medical School). Ramphele won the 1968 South African Jewish Women’s Association Scholarship and the Sir Ernest Oppenheimer Bursary worth about R150 annually for the rest of her years at Medical School.

Ramphele received her Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) from the University of Natal, a BComm in Administration from the University of South Africa as well as diplomas in tropical health &amp; hygiene and Public Health from the University of the Witwatersrand. In 1991 she received her PhD in Social Anthropology from the University of Cape Town. Ramphele has also authored and edited a number of books.

== Activism ==
While at university, Ramphele became increasingly involved in student politics and anti-apartheid activism, becoming one of the founders of the Black Consciousness Movement (BCM), where she met Steve Biko, with whom she had a relationship. As a member of the BCM, she was crucially involved in organising and working with community development programmes. Biko and Ramphele had two children during their affair; Lerato Biko, born in 1974, and Hlumelo Biko, born in 1978. Lerato contracted fatal pneumonia when she was two months old. Their son Hlumelo Biko was born after Biko&#x27;s death. Ramphele and her son would eventually work together in the Circle Group holding company for their family investments.

Ramphele worked with the South African Students&#x27; Organisation (SASO), a breakaway from the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS) that operated on English-speaking white campuses. NUSAS had black and white students as members. SASO was formed in 1969 under the leadership of Steve Biko.

From 1970 onwards Ramphele became increasingly drawn into political activism with Biko, Barney Pityana and other student activists at the Medical School. She was elected the chairperson of the local SASO branch. Ramphele received her qualification in medicine in 1972. She began her medical internship at Durban’s King Edward VIII Hospital, later transferring to Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth.

In 1974, Ramphele was charged under the Suppression of Communism Act for being in possession of banned literature. In 1975, she founded the Zanempilo Community Health Care Centre in Zinyoka, a village outside King William’s Town. It was one of the first primary healthcare initiatives outside the public sector in South Africa. During this time she was also the manager of the Eastern Cape branch of the Black Community Health Programme. She travelled extensively in the Eastern Cape, organising people to be drawn into community projects. In addition to her medical duties, Ramphele also became the director of the Black Community Programmes (BCP) in the Eastern Cape when Biko was banned. In August 1976, Ramphele was detained under Section 10 of the Terrorism Act, one of the first persons to be detained under this newly promulgated law.

In April 1977, Ramphele was issued with banning orders and banished to Tzaneen, Northern Transvaal, where she remained until 1984. A member of the local church arranged for her to live with two African nuns in a local village, Tickeyline. She later established a home for herself in Lenyenye township near Tzaneen, although she remained under police surveillance. During her stay in Tzaneen, Ramphele established the Isutheng Community Health Program, with monetary aid from the BCP. This foundation was used to empower local women and aid them in growing vegetable gardens, amongst other initiatives.

During her stay in Tzaneen, Ramphele enjoyed occasional illicit outings to escape everyday life, as well as visits from Helen Suzman, MP of the Progressive Party. Suzman assisted Ramphele in securing a passport when Ramphele travelled abroad. Ramphele also enjoyed visits from Father Timothy Stanton; an Anglican priest who visited her and celebrated Eucharist with her.

In 1983, she completed her BComm degree through UNISA (the University of South Africa), which she had registered for in 1975. She also completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Tropical Hygiene and a Diploma in Public Health at the University of Witwatersrand. This required that Ramphele apply for a special dispensation to travel to Johannesburg where she had to report at the John Vorster Square Police Station upon her arrival and departure.

Ramphele left Lenyenye in 1984 to go to Port Elizabeth where she was offered a job at Livingstone Hospital. However, she left to take up an appointment at the University of Cape Town (UCT) that Francis Wilson, a Professor of Economics, had arranged. She was to work with him at the South African Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) as a research fellow.

== Career ==
Ramphele joined the University of Cape Town as a research fellow in 1986 and was appointed as one of its deputy vice-chancellors in 1991. She was appointed to the post of vice-chancellor of the university in September 1996, thereby becoming the first black woman to hold such a position at a South African university. Part of her executive role was to take charge of the university’s Equal Opportunity Policy Portfolio, with the aim of changing the culture of the institution. In 1994, Ramphele was a visiting scholar at Harvard University&#x27;s Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US.

In 2000, Ramphele became one of the four managing directors of the World Bank. She was tasked with overseeing the strategic positioning and operations of the World Bank Institute as well as the vice-presidency of external affairs. She was the first South African to hold this position.

Ramphele serves as a trustee of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, served as the director of The Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) and as a board member of the Anglo-American Corporation, non-executive director of Medi Clinic Holdings and Transnet.

Ramphele also served as a trustee for the Link-SA trust, a charitable organisation that raises money to subsidise the tertiary education of South Africa&#x27;s brightest underprivileged students. She was on the board of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, an organisation that supports good governance and great leadership in Africa.

She was voted 55th in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

She is co-founder of ReimagineSA and in 2018 was voted co-president of The Club of Rome

== Politics ==
In 2013, Ramphele expressed interest in South African politics and resigned as the chairperson of Gold Fields. On 18 February 2013, she announced the formation of a new political party, named Agang South Africa (&quot;Agang&quot; is Northern Sotho for &quot;Build&quot;), intended to challenge the African National Congress.

Some critics have challenged Ramphele&#x27;s drawing on Steve Biko&#x27;s legacy in her political campaigns.

On 28 January 2014, Ramphele accepted an invitation from the Democratic Alliance to stand as their presidential candidate in the 2014 general election. On 31 January 2014, Ramphele issued a statement saying that she would not take up Democratic Alliance party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February 2014, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the Democratic Alliance&#x27;s presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.

Agang South Africa won two seats in the National Assembly of South Africa. Following internal conflict within the party, Ramphele announced her withdrawal from politics on 8 July 2014.

<text>Lake Rotoehu is the smallest in a chain of three lakes to the northeast of Lake Rotorua in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is located between the city of Rotorua and town of Whakatāne. The southern end of the lake occupies part of the Okataina caldera. It is fed (underground seepage) by Lake Rotoma to the east, and flows westward joining Lake Rotoiti.
The lake is one of the least visited, but offers great Kayaking and fishing (rainbow trout). It has two access points, Otautu Bay and Kennedy Bay and is well located centrally to many other places e.g. the ocean, mountain biking, hiking etc. It has very good wildlife and birdlife with several rarely seen birds. In particular the endangered kōkako is located close by.

<text>Identity is a 2003 American slasher film directed by James Mangold, written by Michael Cooney, and starring John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet with Alfred Molina, Clea DuVall, and Rebecca De Mornay.

Inspired by Agatha Christie&#x27;s 1939 whodunit &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, the film follows ten strangers in an isolated hotel, who are temporarily cut off from the rest of the world and mysteriously killed off one by one. Several events which take place in the hours before the characters&#x27; arrival are introduced at key moments in the film using reverse chronology structure and, in a parallel story, a murderer awaits a verdict at a crucial trial that will determine whether he will be executed for his crimes.

==Plot==
A convict named Malcolm Rivers awaits execution for a vicious mass murder that took place at an apartment building. Journals belonging to Malcolm are discovered misfiled in the case evidence; they were not introduced during the trial. Malcolm&#x27;s psychiatrist, Dr. Malick, and his defense attorney argue the journals prove Malcolm&#x27;s insanity.

Meanwhile, ten strangers find themselves stranded in a torrential rainstorm at a remote Nevada motel, run by Larry Washington. The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, a washed-up, irritable actress; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a sex worker; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice (who was severely injured when Ed accidentally hit her with his limo), and their nine-year-old son, Timmy.

With the group all in separate rooms, Suzanne is killed by an unknown assailant. Ed discovers Suzanne&#x27;s head in a dryer, along with the number 10 motel key. Maine is suspected to be the killer as he has escaped. Ginny locks herself in the bathroom to escape Lou during a fight, only for the unknown assailant to murder Lou out of Ginny&#x27;s sight.

At the hearing, Malcolm&#x27;s diaries indicate that Malcolm suffers from dissociative identity disorder, harboring eleven distinct personalities. His defense attorney argues that he is unaware of his crimes, which is in violation of existing Supreme Court rulings on capital punishment. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder as Malcolm is brought in.

While taking photos of Lou&#x27;s crime scene, Ed finds the number 9 key in Lou&#x27;s hands. He begins to suspect that the killer is counting down and targeting them in order. Maine fails to escape the motel area, and he is subdued by Rhodes and Ed. Larry is instructed to guard Maine, but suspicion falls on him when Maine is found dead. Rhodes and Ed find the number 8 key next to his body, and they harass Larry, who takes Paris hostage. Paris wrestles him off, causing Larry to attempt to escape in his truck, but he accidentally crushes George against a dumpster as he tries to save Timmy from being run over.

Rhodes ties Larry to a chair and orders the other guests to stay until dawn. Larry convinces Paris and Ed that he is not the perpetrator by telling them how he ended up at the motel. Alice, still in bed, is checked on and presumably has died from her injuries, but Rhodes finds the number 6 key. George&#x27;s body is recovered and the number 7 key is found in his pocket, which confuses the others.

Ed tells Ginny and Timmy to flee in a car, but it explodes upon their arrival. The last four survivors discover that the bodies of all the previous victims have disappeared. Paris has a mental breakdown, revealing her birthday is on May 10; it transpires that all eleven people were born on May 10 — which is also Malcolm&#x27;s birthday and the day he committed the murders.

Ed checks their ID cards in the office, discovering that each one of them is named after a state, and that their birthdays all match. With Dr. Malick calling out to him, Ed finds he is at the hearing, but is confused as to why he is there. Dr. Malick explains that he is one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child. Learning one of the personalities committed the murders, Ed is instructed to &quot;go back&quot; to the motel to try to eliminate them.

As Ed returns to the motel, Paris finds convict-transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car, revealing Rhodes is a criminal acting as an officer. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is shot to death by Rhodes. Finally believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him and the two men end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive.

With the homicidal personality removed, Malcolm&#x27;s execution is stayed and he is ordered to be placed in a mental institution under Dr. Malick&#x27;s care. In Malcolm&#x27;s mind, Paris settles down in her hometown of Frostproof, Florida. As she tends to her orange grove, she discovers the number 1 key buried in the dirt, and she finds Timmy behind her. It is revealed Timmy is actually the murderous personality and that he orchestrated all of the deaths at the motel, including faking his own death. Timmy kills Paris and takes over completely, causing Malcolm to strangle Malick and forcing the van that is en route to the mental institution to swerve off the road and stop before Timmy&#x27;s voice repeats the poem &quot;Antigonish&quot; by William Hughes Mearns one more time.

==Production==
Director James Mangold stated in an interview prior to the film&#x27;s release that he was attracted to a claustrophobic thriller because &quot;I don&#x27;t see this as a genre that&#x27;s tapped out at this point. You can make it sound dead end but these remain some of the most cinematic films ever made, whether you&#x27;re talking about &quot;Rear Window&quot;, &quot;The Others&quot;, Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Knife in the Water&quot;, &quot;Dead Calm&quot;, Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Thing&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, huge piles of great films that buck conventional wisdom that a movie should be cinematically broad like a &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;.&quot;

Actor John Cusack was pursued for the lead because Mangold and producer Cathy Konrad both felt like he was perfect for the role. As Mangold said in another interview, “When you think of movies like &quot;The Grifters&quot;, you don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s such a stretch. I&#x27;d met John a few times and there&#x27;s this great &#x27;Everyman&#x27; sense to him. And while there&#x27;s this great warmth to him, especially as he&#x27;s grown older, there&#x27;s also a simplicity, a gravity to him. There&#x27;s something very solid about John.&quot;

Upon being offered the role and sent the script, Cusack stated &quot;I started reading and I thought &#x27;alright well, we&#x27;ll see how this thing goes&#x27;, then on page 30 I thought I had it pegged and I didn&#x27;t. And then on page 50 I thought I had figured it out, but I didn&#x27;t … and then I kept going this way, and then by the end of it I really hadn&#x27;t seen any of those things coming. So I thought &#x27;man, that&#x27;s pretty seamless&#x27; because you know I should have figured this out.&quot; During an appearance on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot;, Cusack summarized his thoughts by saying &quot;It was one of the most clever scripts I&#x27;ve read in a long time.&quot;

90 percent of the film was shot on Stage 27 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. Stage 27 is the same sound stage that once housed the Emerald City during production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Mangold used production designer Mark Friedberg to transform the sound stage into a complex set with endless rain, featuring a motel with a swimming pool, 14 rooms, and surrounding desert. Filming also took place on location at the Four Aces Movie Ranch in Palmdale, which features the motel from which the motel built on Stage 27 was modeled, Los Angeles City Hall in Los Angeles, and other exterior locations in Palmdale and Lancaster, California.

Angelo Badalamenti was originally signed to score the film, but his music was replaced with a new score by Alan Silvestri.

==Reception==
===Box office performance===
&quot;Identity&quot; opened on April 25, 2003 in the United States and Canada in 2,733 theaters. The film ranked at #1 on its opening weekend, accumulating $16,225,263, with a per theater average of $5,936. The film&#x27;s five-day gross was $18,677,884.

The film dropped down to #3 on its second weekend, behind newly released &quot;X2&quot; and &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot;, accumulating $9,423,662 in a 41.9% drop from its first weekend, and per theater average of $3,448. By its third weekend, it dropped down to #4 and made $6,477,585, $2,474 per theater average.

&quot;Identity&quot; went on to gross $52.1 million in the United States and Canada and $38.1 million overseas. In total, the film has grossed over $90 million worldwide, making it a box office success against its $28 million budget.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 171 reviews, with an average rating of 6.40/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;Identity&quot; is a film that will divide audiences—the twists of its plot will either impress or exasperate you.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of movies that are intriguing for the first two acts and then go on autopilot with a formula ending. &quot;Identity&quot; is a rarity, a movie that seems to be on autopilot for the first two acts and then reveals that it was not, with a third act that causes us to rethink everything that has gone before. Ingenious, how simple and yet how devious the solution is.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of &quot;SFGate&quot; reported, &quot;At first, &quot;Identity&quot; seems like nothing more than a pleasing and blatant homage (i.e., rip-off) to the Agatha Christie-style thriller where marooned guests realize that a murderer is in their midst... we&#x27;ve seen it before. Yet make no mistake. &quot;Identity&quot; is more than an entertaining thriller. It&#x27;s a highly original one.&quot;

&quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Dennis Lim wrote of the film&#x27;s premise, &quot;The premise of the one-rainy-night thriller &quot;Identity&quot; seems like mothballed Agatha Christie,&quot; and of the film&#x27;s third act twist, &quot;The ultimate cliché of plot-twist implausibility, the crucial revelation is so outlandishly fatuous it might have given Donald Kaufman pause. But there&#x27;s nothing self-parodic about &quot;Identity&quot;—the viewer must not only swallow the nullifying third-act bombshell but actually re-engage with the movie on its new, extremely dubious terms.&quot;

Brian Mckay of &quot;eFilmCritic.com&quot; wrote, &quot;This film&#x27;s cardinal sin was not that it had an engrossing but extremely far-fetched setup to a lackluster resolution—a resolution that probably sounded good during the initial script pitch, but which nobody realized was going to be such a misfire until the production was already at the point of no return. No, what &quot;Identity&quot; is guilty of most is bad timing—it simply gives away too much, too soon. At about the halfway mark (if not much sooner), the film&#x27;s big &quot;twist&quot; will finally dawn on you (and if it doesn&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll end up coming right out and saying it five minutes later anyway). And once it does, you will no longer care what happens afterward.&quot;

===Director&#x27;s response and rumored connection to the film &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002)===
Since its release, the film gained a small following. In 2017, Mangold said he&#x27;s very &quot;proud&quot; of the movie: &quot;I love &quot;Identity&quot;, I love it. In fact, I think some of the filmmaking, the craftsmanship, the image making, is such that I&#x27;m very proud of it. Interestingly, when &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002) came out, and there&#x27;s a joke in the movie about someone with split personality, that came out right before &quot;Identity&quot;. You know the joke? Nic Cage is working on this crazy idea for a movie, the idea that the killer has multiple personalities, and &quot;Adaptation&quot; came out about three months before &quot;Identity&quot;. When I saw &quot;Adaptation&quot;, I realized I was dead. Half the reviews of &quot;Identity&quot; were going, like, this is the movie about the stupid joke, someone made a movie of the joke in &quot;Adaptation&quot;. And it was crushing, honestly, it was crushing because I spent a year and a half working on the movie, and it was kind of like half of the reviews were calling it silly. But part of what I loved about &quot;Identity&quot;, and maybe you too, was that it was so crazy, that it was just a completely crazy movie. And the freedom of the concept meant that you could exist in a more dreamy, fever-dream space with the film, which was very freeing to me, to be this kind of noir &quot;And Then There Were None&quot; amped up to eleven on the volume knob. It was very exciting for me, and hugely enjoyable, and I&#x27;m very proud of the movie.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film and Best DVD Special Edition Release at 30th Saturn Awards, but lost to &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, respectively.

<doc id="1164545" wikidata="Q3215166" url="?curid=1164545" title="Lake Rotomā">
<text>Lake Rotomā (also spelled Rotoma) is the fourth largest lake of the 11 lakes in the Rotorua Lakes district, or the Hot Lakes district as it was known in the early decades of the 20th century. The Rotorua lakes are located in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island in the Bay of Plenty Region. Lake Rotomā is the easternmost in the chain of three lakes to the northeast of Lake Rotorua The other two are Lake Rotoiti and Lake Rotoehu. Rotomā is located halfway between the city of Rotorua and town of Whakatāne.

Lake Rotomā has a high water quality with visibility up to around 13 metres deep. The lake has a maximum depth of 83 metres in the northern part and 73.5 metres in the southern part.

==Geography==
Lake Rotomā was formed within the Rotomā Caldera when lava flows from a large crater explosion blocked its outlet 9,500 years ago. The hills fringing the south and east of the lake are made up of rhyolite from eruptions from its own caldera, the Haroharo and Tarawera vent alignments, all in the Ōkataina Volcanic Centre, and this has meant that Lake Rotomā has no surface outlets. However, the presence of springs has suggested an underground discharge of lake waters. The water level of Rotomā reaches an excessive high or low level every 10–15 years. In times of extreme low levels, the sunken island &quot;Motutara&quot; in the lake may be exposed.

==History==

===Road===

Before the road around Lake Rotomā was constructed, there were several Māori trails over the Rotomā hill which could be used to get between Rotorua and the Eastern Bay of Plenty by foot, but these trails were too narrow and uneven to be used by horses. Travellers from Rotorua could only get as far as Tikitere on the rough track.
In May 1895 work commenced on the Tikitere to Rotoma road. By July, there were three road gangs working on different sections of the road, and work began over the difficult section over the Rotomā hill in the summer of 1895–1896. A proper road was also constructed from Te Ngae in Rotorua through to Tikitere.

Once the road was completed, horse-drawn traffic commenced and public coaching services began. The first such service was started in 1907 by the R.M. Company, who ran a service twice a week from Rotorua to Ōpōtiki carrying mail and up to three passengers. In 1910 the R.M. Company upgraded to a large coach drawn by five horses which could hold 10 passengers.
In 1916 Colletts of Rotorua started the first regular motor car service, using Cadillac service cars. The average travel time from Rotorua to Whakatāne was 5 hours, but like the horse-drawn coaches, the service cars could take up to 9 hours to travel this distance depending on the driving conditions. The road surface gradually improved, decreasing the travel time to 3 hours by the late 1920s. Today, this journey takes just one hour and 20 minutes.

In 1947, 60 men were employed on the construction of the Rotorua to Whakatāne highway, as increases in traffic had caused problems on the road which was barely 12 feet wide.
In the winter of 1956 the lake level of Rotomā rose very high, causing the road to be shifted to higher ground. More serious flooding occurred in 1962, and the famous &quot;cheese cutting&quot; landmark was destroyed and used to build up the road. The cheese cutting was a large wedge shaped rock formed during road construction in 1895–1896 when the road gangs cut the road through a hill with picks and shovels and left a portion of the hill standing.

===Establishments===

Various establishments have come and gone at Rotomā, and most were set up to service the passing traveller&#x27;s desire for rest stops, refreshments and accommodation.

====Past establishments====
* &quot;Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Kettle Store and Tearooms&quot;, then &quot;The Kettle Store and Garage&quot;.
* &quot;T &amp; K Service Station&quot;
* &quot;Stillwater Lodge &amp; Motel&quot;
* &quot;Rotoma Accommodation House&quot;
* &quot;El Toreador Dine and Dance&quot;
* &quot;Atkinson&#x27;s Fishing Lodge&quot;, later renamed &quot;Merge Lodge&quot;
* &quot;Rotoma Traders&quot;

In 1912 it could take up to 9 hours to cover the distance between Rotorua and Whakatāne, and changing stations for the horses had been set up every 14 miles from Rotorua. The changing station at the west end of Rotomā became a popular rest stop. John Baker ran a post office and tearooms here, and built up a reputation for his corned beef. Mr. Baker offered the traveller a choice of corned beef with potatoes and cabbage or corned beef sandwiches.

The Pilbrow family arrived in Rotomā in 1948 after purchasing the Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office. They expanded the business to include a general store, and renamed it The Kettle Store and Tearooms. They then built a garage for motor repairs, and the business became The Kettle Store and Garage. Petrol pumps were later installed by the Pilbrow family to create T &amp; K Filling Station. There was an extremely high level of rainfall in 1961 which caused serious flooding problems, and the business was badly affected. The floodwater raised the petrol tanks out of the ground and the road had to be built up to act as a stop-bank. A pump was in action 24 hours a day for weeks to prevent the water from completely flooding the premises.
The Pilbrow family also created Oxford Road.

The original homestead which became known as Atkinson&#x27;s Fishing Lodge was built early in the 1900s by Mr and Mrs C. Atkinson who farmed near the lake and had an orchard on the opposite side of the road. The homestead was turned into a lodge which became very popular with fishermen. The lodge was renamed Merge Lodge by Geoff and Roy Warwick, formerly of Kawerau, who took over ownership in 1960. The lodge had six bedrooms, a billiard room, two kitchens, two lounges, and a store out the front. There is now a caravan park at the site of Merge Lodge.

====Education====
* Lake Rotomā School

===&quot;Suicide Beach&quot;===

The bay at the foot of the Rotomā hill where Manawahe Road commences had the nickname &quot;Suicide Beach&quot; in the past due to the occurrence of a murder-suicide there in May 1925. The real story was lost over time, with the majority of Rotomā local residents holding the belief that it had been a young honeymoon couple who committed suicide there together. However, in actuality it was a 38-year-old man and a 14-year-old girl; understood to have been romantically attached. The man, Carl Olsen, had told the girl&#x27;s father of his love for her. In an attempt to separate the pair, the disapproving parents sent the girl, Molly Moors, to live with an aunt in Hastings. Without her aunts knowledge, Olsen picked Molly up in his car and it was assumed they were on their way to Hamilton when they met death at the shores of Rotomā. The event was well covered by newspapers of the time and was referred to as the &quot;Rotoma Tragedy&quot;. Olsen and Moors are buried next to each other in the Rotorua Cemetery, and their graves were probably originally marked with wooden crosses. The original crosses disintegrated over time leaving the two graves unmarked for many years before being remarked with new matching wooden crosses in May 2011.

===Sunken island===
Four buoys in the southern portion of Lake Rotomā mark the location of Motutara, the sunken island, which sits just under the lakes surface. Occasionally the lake level drops low enough to expose the top of the island.
There was once a Māori village on the island, and according to the legend, an old Tohunga resided there amongst the other inhabitants. His name was Te Rarau-mai-Waho, and he was very powerful and dangerous. The cloud the old Tohunga cast over the island was lifted only on the occasions where he went to visit some of his relations in Kawerau and around Putauaki, Mount Edgecumbe. One night he returned from such a visit and called out to the people of the island from the lake&#x27;s edge by Matahi lagoon, ordering them to send him a canoe. Nobody responded to his demands, and in his anger the Tohunga put a curse on the island and its inhabitants. The people of the island heard the angry Tohunga&#x27;s terrible screams, but did not realise the horrible retribution he would take. The curse caused the island to slowly sink, and by morning it was completely underwater; the only signs of the village being bodies and pieces of wreckage floating on the surface of the lake. Some people had escaped by swimming to the shore of the lake, and these people eventually settled in the South Island. The Waikato Underwater Club has examined Motutara. Two platforms or terraces were found, and some hāngī stones were found at the peak. It has been suggested that if the Pā had been palisaded it may have still been there today.

==Settlement==
Statistics New Zealand describes Rotomā as a rural settlement, which covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The settlement is part of the larger Rotoiti-Rotoehu statistical area.
Before the 2023 census, the settlement had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Rotomā had a population of 255 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 81 people (46.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 33 people (14.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 99 households, comprising 135 males and 120 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.12 males per female. The median age was 50.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 39 people (15.3%) aged under 15 years, 30 (11.8%) aged 15 to 29, 129 (50.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 60 (23.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 80.0% European/Pākehā, 30.6% Māori, 3.5% Pasifika, 1.2% Asian, and 2.4% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 57.6% had no religion, 28.2% were Christian, 3.5% had Māori religious beliefs, 1.2% were Buddhist and 2.4% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 27 (12.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 39 (18.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $23,400, compared with $31,800 nationally. 24 people (11.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 81 (37.5%) people were employed full-time, 36 (16.7%) were part-time, and 18 (8.3%) were unemployed.

===Early settlement===
The early road construction crews commented on the lack of Māori settlement in Rotomā and in the neighbouring Lake Rotoehu. However, fortified pā sites, food pits, cultivation areas and burial sites have been discovered around the shoreline of Rotomā and the surrounding hills . The tribe Ngāti Tūwharetoa may not have lived permanently at Rotomā but at least took out a temporary camping existence there to take advantage of the hunting and fishing opportunities on offer. Later, Ngāti Tūāhuriri, a sub-tribe of Ngāti Pikiao took up residence at Rotomā. Māori living at nearby Rotoiti credited the frequent conflict between Māori and Pākehā as the cause of the dispersion of this Māori population, and they had left Lake Rotomā by the time the road construction began in 1895.

A census for the years 1874 to 1891 shows nil for Rotomā. In 1896 a census shows a population of 33, understood to be the occupants of the camp set up for the road workers and their families at the east end of Oneroa beach by the lagoon.

===Oxford Road===
In 1948, Mr and Mrs T.H. Pilbrow and their children arrived at Lake Rotomā from Oxford in Canterbury. They had purchased the Rotoma Tearooms and Post Office, which was situated on 25 acres of land.
In a district of predominantly leasehold land, the Pilbrows realised the value of their 25 acres of freehold land and decided to subdivide it in 1950. Sixty-three sections were surveyed, the majority each a quarter acre, and four of these were taken by the Rotorua County Council for a reserve. Seventeen sections were along the main road, but a new road was required to access the sections to the rear. The Pilbrows named the new road &quot;Oxford Road&quot; as a reminder of their hometown.

==Education==

Lake Rotomā School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of .

The first school was opened on 2 February 1928 in the old tearooms building with Mr. E.G. Sutherland teaching the 8 students. Mr Sutherland stated that it was &quot;probably the worst building in New Zealand. However, when the weather was too bad we just declared a holiday – and nobody seemed to worry&quot;
A new school was built and opened in its present location on Soda Springs Road on 25 May 1936 with 29 students.

The roll fluctuated due to numerous residents living at Rotomā on a temporary basis. The mills in the area, Tunnicliffe&#x27;s Mill and Rendall&#x27;s Mill, helped establish a more stable population at Rotomā and caused further overcrowding at the school. In 1973 the roll reached 55 and there were appalling working conditions for staff and children. On 14 August 1973 the majority of parents kept their children at home as a protest against the lack of action to improve standards. There was widespread media coverage and in October the Minister of Education ordered that a new school be built, and it was opened on 16 November 1974.

From 1948, Mr Tam Pilbrow operated the first bus service to the school, using a Hillman car. In 1952 the service was taken over by George Graham, and Mr. Pilbrow&#x27;s son Ken, who operated a Bradford van from the Kettle Store. Mr Gavin Wyllie bought the Kettle Store and Garage, and in 1958 he commenced transporting children to the school in his V.W combie van, but when Rendall&#x27;s Mill closed at the end of that same year, there were not enough children for him to continue the service.

== Conservation ==
Due to invasive plant introduction, the native plants have been outcompeted within the lake and crayfish populations have declined considerably. The local tribe Te Arawa has been involved in efforts to remove the invasive weeds and restore the crayfish populations by attaching woven flax mats called uwhi to the bottom of the lake that limit the growth of the invasive plants while the thinner native plants are able to thrive. Burlap and rubber mats were unsuccessful as they would lift off the lake bottom from the accumulated gas from the decaying plants.

<doc id="1164547" wikidata="Q169984" url="?curid=1164547" title="Gino Severini">
<text>Gino Severini (7 April 1883 – 26 February 1966) was an Italian painter and a leading member of the Futurist movement. For much of his life he divided his time between Paris and Rome. He was associated with neo-classicism and the &quot;return to order&quot; in the decade after the First World War. During his career he worked in a variety of media, including mosaic and fresco. He showed his work at major exhibitions, including the Rome Quadrennial, and won art prizes from major institutions.

== Early life ==

Severini was born into a poor family in Cortona, Italy. His father was a junior court official and his mother a dressmaker. He studied at the Scuola Tecnica in Cortona until the age of fifteen, when he and a group of fellow-classmates were expelled from the entire Italian school system for the attempted theft of exam papers. The boys escaped a custodial sentence but Severini never again attended formal education. For a while he worked with his father; then in 1899 he moved to Rome with his mother. It was there that he first showed a serious interest in art, painting in his spare time while working as a shipping clerk. With the help of a patron of Cortonese origins he attended art classes, enrolling in the free school for nude studies (an annex of the Rome Fine Art Institute) and a private academy. His formal art education ended after two years when his patron stopped his allowance, declaring, &quot;I absolutely do not understand your lack of order.&quot;

In 1900 he met the painter Umberto Boccioni. Together they visited the studio of Giacomo Balla, where they were introduced to the technique of Divisionism, painting with adjacent rather than mixed colors and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. The ideas of Divisionism had a great influence on Severini&#x27;s early work and on Futurist painting from 1910 to 1911.

Severini settled in Paris in November 1906. The move was momentous for him. He said later, &quot;The cities to which I feel most strongly bound are Cortona and Paris: I was born physically in the first, intellectually and spiritually in the second.&quot; He lived in Montmartre and dedicated himself to painting. There he met most of the rising artists of the period, befriending Amedeo Modigliani and occupying a studio next to those of Raoul Dufy, Georges Braque and Suzanne Valadon. He knew most of the Parisian avant-garde, including Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Pablo Picasso, Lugné-Poe and his theatrical circle, the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Fort, Max Jacob, and author Jules Romains. The sale of his work did not provide enough to live on and he depended on the generosity of patrons.

==Futurism==
He was invited by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti and Boccioni to join the Futurist movement and was a co-signatory, with Balla, Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, and Luigi Russolo, of the &quot;Manifesto of the Futurist Painters&quot; in February 1910 and the &quot;Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting&quot; in April the same year. He was an important link between artists in France and Italy and came into contact with Cubism before his Futurist colleagues. Following a visit to Paris in 1911, the Italian Futurists adopted a sort of Cubism, which gave them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism. Severini helped to organize the first Futurist exhibition outside Italy at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, in February 1912 and participated in subsequent Futurist shows in Europe and the United States. In 1913, he had solo exhibitions at the Marlborough Gallery, London, and Der Sturm, Berlin; it was during the show in London when he met and befriended British artist C. R. W. Nevinson, ultimately leading to the latter&#x27;s decision to become a fellow Futurist.

In his autobiography, written many years later, he records that the Futurists were pleased with the response to the exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, but that influential critics, notably Apollinaire, mocked them for their pretensions, their ignorance of the main currents of modern art and their provincialism. Severini later came to agree with Apollinaire.

Severini was less attracted to the subject of the machine than his fellow Futurists and frequently chose the form of the dancer to express Futurist theories of dynamism in art. He was particularly adept at rendering lively urban scenes, for example in &quot;Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Boulevard&quot; (1913). During the First World War he produced some of the finest Futurist war art, notably his &quot;Italian Lancers at a Gallop&quot; (1915) and &quot;Armoured Train&quot; (1915). He spent part of the war in Barcelona, but returned to Paris by July 1915.

==Crystal Cubism and Neo-classicism==
In 1916 Severini departed from Futurism and painted several works in a naturalistic style inspired by his interest in early Renaissance art. After the First World War, Severini gradually abandoned the Futurist style and painted in a synthetic Crystal Cubist style until 1920. 
By 1920 he was applying theories of classical balance based on the Golden Section to still lifes and figurative subjects from the traditional commedia dell&#x27;arte. He became part of the &quot;return to order&quot; in the arts in the post-war era. Works such as &quot;The Two Pulchinellas&quot; (1922) exemplify Severini&#x27;s turn toward a more conservative, analytic type of painting, which nonetheless suggests metaphysical overtones.

After 1920, Severini divided his time between Paris and Rome. In 1921, he was commissioned by George Sitwell to paint murals for Montefugoni castle, which the latter had bought in 1909; the same year, Severini published &quot;Du cubisme au classicisme: Esthétique du compas et du nombre&quot;, a book summarizing his research into mathematical theories of harmony and proportion. The murals were completed in 1922.

In 1923 and 1925 he took part in the Rome Biennale. He exhibited in Milan with artists of the Novecento Italiano group in 1926 and 1929 and in their Geneva exhibition of 1929. From 1928 he began to incorporate elements of Rome&#x27;s classical landscape in his work. In 1930 he took part in the Venice Biennale, exhibited in the Rome Quadrennials of 1931 and 1935, and in 1935 won the first prize for painting, with an entire room devoted to his work. He contributed a cycle of works to the Paris Exhibition. He explored fresco and mosaic techniques and executed murals in various media in Switzerland, France, and Italy.

During this decade, he taught the Swiss printmaker Lill Tschudi, who had previously studied at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art.

==Later life==
In the 1940s Severini&#x27;s style became semi-abstract. In the 1950s he returned to his Futurist subjects: dancers, light and movement. He executed commissions for the church of Saint-Pierre in Freiburg and inaugurated the &quot;Conségna delle Chiavi&quot; (&quot;Delivery of the Keys&quot;) mosaic. His mosaics were shown at the Cahiers d&#x27;Art gallery in Paris and he participated in a conference on the history of mosaic at Ravenna. He received commissions to decorate the offices of KLM in Rome and Alitalia in Paris and took part in the exhibition &quot;The Futurists, Balla - Severini 1912–1918&quot; at the Rose Fried Gallery in New York. In Rome he reconstructed his &quot;Pan Pan Dance&quot; mosaic, which had been destroyed in the war. He was awarded the &quot;Premio Nazionale di Pittura&quot; of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, exhibited at the 9th Rome Quadrennal and was given a solo exhibition at the Accademia di San Luca.

Throughout his career he published important theoretical essays and books on art. In 1946 he published an autobiography, &quot;The Life of a Painter&quot;.

Severini died in Paris on 26 February 1966, aged 82. He was buried at Cortona.

<text>In medicine, proton therapy, or proton radiotherapy, is a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to irradiate diseased tissue, most often to treat cancer. The chief advantage of proton therapy over other types of external beam radiotherapy is that the dose of protons is deposited over a narrow range of depth; hence in minimal entry, exit, or scattered radiation dose to healthy nearby tissues.

When evaluating whether to treat a tumor with photon or proton therapy, physicians may choose proton therapy if it is important to deliver a higher radiation dose to targeted tissues while significantly decreasing radiation to nearby organs at risk. The American Society for Radiation Oncology Model Policy for Proton Beam therapy says proton therapy is considered reasonable if sparing the surrounding normal tissue &quot;cannot be adequately achieved with photon-based radiotherapy&quot; and can benefit the patient. Like photon radiation therapy, proton therapy is often used in conjunction with surgery and/or chemotherapy to most effectively treat cancer.

==Description==

Proton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy that uses ionizing radiation. In proton therapy, medical personnel use a particle accelerator to target a tumor with a beam of protons. These charged particles damage the DNA of cells, ultimately killing them by stopping their reproduction and thus eliminating the tumor. Cancerous cells are particularly vulnerable to attacks on DNA because of their high rate of division and their limited ability to repair DNA damage. Some cancers with specific defects in DNA repair may be more sensitive to proton radiation.

Proton therapy lets physicians deliver a highly conformal beam, i.e. delivering radiation that conforms to the shape and depth of the tumor and sparing much of the surrounding, normal tissue. For example, when comparing proton therapy to the most advanced types of photon therapy—intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)—proton therapy can give similar or higher radiation doses to the tumor with a 50%-60% lower total body radiation dose.

Protons can focus energy delivery to fit the tumor shape, delivering only low-dose radiation to surrounding tissue. As a result, the patient has fewer side effects. All protons of a given energy have a certain penetration range; very few protons penetrate beyond that distance. Also, the dose delivered to tissue is maximized only over the last few millimeters of the particle&#x27;s range; this maximum is called the &quot;spread out Bragg peak&quot;, often called the SOBP (see visual).

To treat tumors at greater depth, one needs a beam with higher energy, typically given in MeV (mega electron volts). Accelerators used for proton therapy typically produce protons with energies of 70 to 250 MeV. Adjusting proton energy during the treatment maximizes the cell damage within the tumor. Tissue closer to the surface of the body than the tumor gets less radiation, and thus less damage. Tissues deeper in the body get very few protons, so the dose becomes immeasurably small.

In most treatments, protons of different energies with Bragg peaks at different depths are applied to treat the entire tumor. These Bragg peaks are shown as thin blue lines in the figure in this section. While tissues behind (or deeper than) the tumor get almost no radiation, the tissues in front of (shallower than) the tumor get radiation dosage based on the SOBP.

===Equipment===

Most installed proton therapy systems use isochronous cyclotrons. Cyclotrons are considered simple to operate, reliable and can be made compact, especially with use of superconducting magnets. Synchrotrons can also be used, with the advantage of easier production at varying energies. Linear accelerators, as used for photon radiation therapy, are becoming commercially available as limitations of size and cost are resolved. Modern proton systems incorporate high-quality imaging for daily assessment of tumor contours, treatment planning software illustrating 3D dose distributions, and various system configurations, e.g. multiple treatment rooms connected to one accelerator. Partly because of these advances in technology, and partly because of the continually increasing amount of proton clinical data, the number of hospitals offering proton therapy continues to grow.

=== FLASH therapy ===
FLASH radiotherapy is a technique under development for photon and proton treatments, using very high dose rates (necessitating large beam currents). If applied clinically, it could shorten treatment time to just one to three 1-second sessions, and further reducing side effects.

==History==
The first suggestion that energetic protons could be an effective treatment was made by Robert R. Wilson in a paper published in 1946 while he was involved in the design of the Harvard Cyclotron Laboratory (HCL). The first treatments were performed with particle accelerators built for physics research, notably Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in 1954 and at Uppsala in Sweden in 1957. In 1961, a collaboration began between HCL and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to pursue proton therapy. Over the next 41 years, this program refined and expanded these techniques while treating 9,116 patients before the cyclotron was shut down in 2002. In the USSR a therapeutic proton beam with energies up to 200 MeV was obtained at the synchrocyclotron of JINR in Dubna in 1967. The ITEP center in Moscow, Russia, which began treating patients in 1969, is the oldest proton center still in operation. The Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland was the world&#x27;s first proton center to treat eye tumors beginning in 1984. In addition, they invented pencil beam scanning in 1996, which became the state-of-the art form of proton therapy.

The world&#x27;s first hospital-based proton therapy center was a low energy cyclotron centre for eye tumors at Clatterbridge Centre for Oncology in the UK, opened in 1989, followed in 1990 at the Loma Linda University Medical Center (LLUMC) in Loma Linda, California. Later, the Northeast Proton Therapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital was brought online, and the HCL treatment program was transferred to it in 2001 and 2002. At the beginning of 2023, there were 41 proton therapy centers in the United States, and a total of 89 worldwide. As of 2020, six manufacturers make proton therapy systems: Hitachi, Ion Beam Applications, Mevion Medical Systems, ProNova Solutions, ProTom International and Varian Medical Systems.

==Types==
The newest form of proton therapy, pencil beam scanning, gives therapy by sweeping a proton beam laterally over the target so that it gives the required dose while closely conforming to shape of the targeted tumor. Before the use of pencil beam scanning, oncologists used a scattering method to direct a wide beam toward the tumor.
===Passive scattering beam delivery===
The first commercially available proton delivery systems used a scattering process, or passive scattering, to deliver the therapy. With scattering proton therapy the proton beam is spread out by scattering devices, and the beam is then shaped by putting items such as collimators and compensators in the path of the protons. The collimators were custom made for the patient with milling machines. Passive scattering gives homogeneous dose along the target volume. Therefore, passive scattering gives more limited control over dose distributions proximal to target. Over time many scattering therapy systems have been upgraded to deliver pencil beam scanning. Because scattering therapy was the first type of proton therapy available, most clinical data available on proton therapy—especially long-term data as of 2020—were acquired via scattering technology.

===Pencil beam scanning beam delivery===
A newer and more flexible delivery method is pencil beam scanning, using a beam that sweeps laterally over the target so that it delivers the needed dose while closely conforming to the tumor&#x27;s shape. This conformal delivery is achieved by shaping the dose through magnetic scanning of thin beamlets of protons without needing apertures and compensators. Multiple beams are delivered from different directions, and magnets in the treatment nozzle steer the proton beam to conform to the target volume layer as the dose is painted layer by layer. This type of scanning delivery provides greater flexibility and control, letting the proton dose conform more precisely to the shape of the tumor.

Delivery of protons via pencil beam scanning, in use since 1996 at the Paul Scherrer Institute, allows for the most precise type of proton delivery: intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). IMPT is to proton therapy what IMRT is to conventional photon therapy—treatment that more closely conforms to the tumor while avoiding surrounding structures. Virtually all new proton systems provide pencil beam scanning exclusively. A study led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center suggests that IMPT can improve local control when compared to passive scattering for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies.

==Application==
It was estimated that by the end of 2019, a total of ≈200,000 patients had been treated with proton therapy. Physicians use protons to treat conditions in two broad categories:
* Disease sites that respond well to higher doses of radiation, i.e., dose escalation. Dose escalation has sometimes shown a higher probability of &quot;cure&quot; (i.e. local control) than conventional radiotherapy. These include, among others, uveal melanoma (ocular tumor), skull base and paraspinal tumor (chondrosarcoma and chordoma), and unresectable sarcoma. In all these cases proton therapy gives significant improvement in the probability of local control, over conventional radiotherapy. For eye tumors, proton therapy also has high rates of maintaining the natural eye.
* Treatment where proton therapy&#x27;s increased precision reduces unwanted side effects by lessening the dose to normal tissue. In these cases, the tumor dose is the same as in conventional therapy, so there is no expectation of increased probability of curing the disease. Instead, emphasis is on reducing the dose to normal tissue, thus reducing unwanted effects.

Two prominent examples are pediatric neoplasms (such as medulloblastoma) and prostate cancer.

===Pediatric===
Irreversible long-term side effects of conventional radiation therapy for pediatric cancers are well documented and include growth disorders, neurocognitive toxicity, ototoxicity with subsequent effects on learning and language development, and renal, endocrine and gonadal dysfunctions. Radiation-induced secondary malignancy is another very serious adverse effect that has been reported. As there is minimal exit dose when using proton radiation therapy, dose to surrounding normal tissues can be significantly limited, reducing the acute toxicity which positively impacts the risk for these long-term side effects. Cancers requiring craniospinal irradiation, for example, benefit from the absence of exit dose with proton therapy: dose to the heart, mediastinum, bowel, bladder and other tissues anterior to the vertebrae is eliminated, hence a reduction of acute thoracic, gastrointestinal and bladder side effects.

===Eye tumor===
Proton therapy for eye tumors is a special case since this treatment requires only relatively low energy protons (≈70 MeV). Owing to this low energy, some particle therapy centers only treat eye tumors. Proton, or more generally, hadron therapy of tissue close to the eye affords sophisticated methods to assess the alignment of the eye that can vary significantly from other patient position verification approaches in image guided particle therapy. Position verification and correction must ensure that the radiation spares sensitive tissue like the optic nerve to preserve the patient&#x27;s vision.

For ocular tumors, selecting the type of radiotherapy depends on tumor location and extent, tumor radioresistance (calculating the dose needed to eliminate the tumor), and the therapy&#x27;s potential toxic side effects on nearby critical structures. For example, proton therapy is an option for retinoblastoma and intraocular melanoma. The advantage of a proton beam is that it has the potential to effectively treat the tumor while sparing sensitive structures of the eye. Given its effectiveness, proton therapy has been described as the &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment for ocular melanoma. The implementation of momentum cooling technique in proton therapy for eye treatment can significantly enhance its effectiveness. This technique aids in reducing the radiation dose administered to healthy organs while ensuring that the treatment is completed within a few seconds. Consequently, patients experience improved comfort during the procedure.

===Base of skull cancer===
When receiving radiation for skull base tumors, side effects of the radiation can include pituitary hormone dysfunction and visual field deficit—after radiation for pituitary tumors—as well as cranial neuropathy (nerve damage), radiation-induced osteosarcoma (bone cancer), and osteoradionecrosis, which occurs when radiation causes part of the bone in the jaw or skull base to die. Proton therapy has been very effective for people with base of skull tumors. Unlike conventional photon radiation, protons do not penetrate beyond the tumor. Proton therapy lowers the risk of treatment-related side effects from when healthy tissue gets radiation. Clinical studies have found proton therapy to be effective for skull base tumors.

===Head and neck tumor===
Proton particles do not deposit exit dose, so proton therapy can spare normal tissues far from the tumor. This is particularly useful for head and neck tumors because of the anatomic constraints found in nearly all cancers in this region. The dosimetric advantage unique to proton therapy translates into toxicity reduction. For recurrent head and neck cancer requiring reirradiation, proton therapy is able to maximize a focused dose of radiation to the tumor while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues, hence a minimal acute toxicity profile, even in patients who got multiple prior courses of radiotherapy.

===Left-side breast cancer===
When breast cancer — especially in the left breast — is treated with conventional radiation, the lung and heart, which are near the left breast, are particularly susceptible to photon radiation damage. Such damage can eventually cause lung problems (e.g. lung cancer) or various heart problems. Depending on location of the tumor, damage can also occur to the esophagus, or to the chest wall (which can potentially lead to leukemia). One recent study showed that proton therapy has low toxicity to nearby healthy tissues and similar rates of disease control compared with conventional radiation. Other researchers found that proton pencil beam scanning techniques can reduce both the mean heart dose and the internal mammary node dose to essentially zero.

Small studies have found that, compared to conventional photon radiation, proton therapy delivers minimal toxic dose to healthy tissues and specifically decreased dose to the heart and lung. Large-scale trials are underway to examine other potential benefits of proton therapy to treat breast cancer.

===Lymphoma===
Though chemotherapy is the main treatment for lymphoma, consolidative radiation is often used in Hodgkin lymphoma and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, while definitive treatment with radiation alone is used in a small fraction of lymphoma patients. Unfortunately, treatment-related toxicities caused by chemotherapy agents and radiation exposure to healthy tissues are major concerns for lymphoma survivors. Advanced radiation therapy technologies such as proton therapy may offer significant and clinically relevant advantages such as sparing important organs at risk and decreasing the risk for late normal tissue damage while still achieving the primary goal of disease control. This is especially important for lymphoma patients who are being treated with curative intent and have long life expectancy following therapy.

===Prostate cancer===
In prostate cancer cases, the issue is less clear. Some published studies found a reduction in long term rectal and genito-urinary damage when treating with protons rather than photons (meaning X-ray or gamma ray therapy). Others showed a small difference, limited to cases where the prostate is particularly close to certain anatomical structures. The relatively small improvement found may be the result of inconsistent patient set-up and internal organ movement during treatment, which offsets most of the advantage of increased precision. One source suggests that dose errors around 20% can result from motion errors of just . and another that prostate motion is between .

The number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed each year far exceeds those of the other diseases referred to above, and this has led some, but not all, facilities to devote most of their treatment slots to prostate treatments. For example, two hospital facilities devote ≈65% and 50% of their proton treatment capacity to prostate cancer, while a third devotes only 7.1%.

Worldwide numbers are hard to compile, but one example says that in 2003 ≈26% of proton therapy treatments worldwide were for prostate cancer.

===Gastrointestinal malignancy===
A growing amount of data shows that proton therapy has great potential to increase therapeutic tolerance for patients with GI malignancy. The possibility of decreasing radiation dose to organs at risk may also help facilitate chemotherapy dose escalation or allow new chemotherapy combinations. Proton therapy will play a decisive role for ongoing intensified combined modality treatments for GI cancers. The following review presents the benefits of proton therapy in treating hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer.

===Hepatocellular carcinoma===
Post-treatment liver decompensation, and subsequent liver failure, is a risk with radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of primary liver cancer. Research shows that proton therapy gives favorable results related to local tumor control, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Other studies, which examine proton therapy compared with conventional photon therapy, show that proton therapy gives improved survival and/or fewer side effects; hence proton therapy could significantly improve clinical outcomes for some patients with liver cancer.

===Reirradiation for recurrent cancer===
For patients who get local or regional recurrences after their initial radiation therapy, physicians are limited in their treatment options due to their reluctance to give additional photon radiation therapy to tissues that have already been irradiated. Re-irradiation is a potentially curative treatment option for patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancer. In particular, pencil beam scanning may be ideally suited for reirradiation. Research shows the feasibility of using proton therapy with acceptable side effects, even in patients who have had multiple prior courses of photon radiation.

==Comparison with other treatments==
A large study on comparative effectiveness of proton therapy was published by teams of the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University in St. Louis in JAMA Oncology, assessing if proton therapy in the setting of concurrent chemoradiotherapy is associated with fewer 90-day unplanned hospitalizations and overall survival compared with concurrent photon therapy and chemoradiotherapy. The study included 1483 adult patients with nonmetastatic, locally advanced cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with curative intent and concluded, &quot;proton chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly reduced acute adverse events that caused unplanned hospitalizations, with similar disease-free and overall survival&quot;. A significant number of randomized controlled trials is recruiting, but only a limited number have been completed as of August 2020. A phase III randomized controlled trial of proton beam therapy versus radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma organized by the National Cancer Center in Korea showed better 2-year local progression-free survival for the proton arm and concluded that proton beam therapy (PBT) is &quot;not inferior to RFA in terms of local progression-free survival and safety, denoting that either RFA or PBT can be applied to recurrent small HCC patients&quot;. A phase IIB randomized controlled trial of proton beam therapy versus IMRT for locally advanced esophageal cancer organized by University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center concluded that proton beam therapy reduced the risk and severity of adverse events compared with IMRT while maintaining similar progression free survival. Another Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial comparing photons versus protons for Glioblastoma concluded that patients at risk of severe lymphopenia could benefit from proton therapy. A team from Stanford University assessed the risk of secondary cancer after primary cancer treatment with external beam radiation using data from the National Cancer Database for 9 tumor types: head and neck, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, lymphoma, lung, prostate, breast, bone/soft tissue, and brain/central nervous system. The study included a total of 450,373 patients and concluded that proton therapy was associated with a lower risk of second cancer.

The issue of when, whether, and how best to apply this technology is still under discussion by physicians and researchers. One recently introduced method, &#x27;model-based selection&#x27;, uses comparative treatment plans for IMRT and IMPT in combination with normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models to identify patients who may benefit most from proton therapy.

Clinical trials are underway to examine the comparative efficacy of proton therapy (vs photon radiation) for the following:

The figure at the right of the page shows how beams of X-rays (IMRT; left frame) and beams of protons (right frame), of different energies, penetrate human tissue. A tumor with a sizable thickness is covered by the IMRT spread out Bragg peak (SOBP) shown as the red lined distribution in the figure. The SOBP is an overlap of several pristine Bragg peaks (blue lines) at staggered depths.

Megavoltage X-ray therapy has less &quot;skin sparing potential&quot; than proton therapy: X-ray radiation at the skin, and at very small depths, is lower than for proton therapy. One study estimates that passively scattered proton fields have a slightly higher entrance dose at the skin (≈75%) compared to therapeutic megavoltage (MeV) photon beams (≈60%). X-ray radiation dose falls off gradually, needlessly harming tissue deeper in the body and damaging the skin and surface tissue opposite the beam entrance. The differences between the two methods depends on:
* Width of the SOBP
* Depth of the tumor
* Number of beams that treat the tumor
The X-ray advantage of less harm to skin at the entrance is partially counteracted by harm to skin at exit point.

Since X-ray treatments are usually done with multiple exposures from opposite sides, each section of skin is exposed to both entering and exiting X-rays. In proton therapy, skin exposure at the entrance point is higher, but tissues on the opposite side of the body to the tumor get no radiation. Thus, X-ray therapy causes slightly less damage to skin and surface tissues, and proton therapy causes less damage to deeper tissues in front of and beyond the target.

An important consideration in comparing these treatments is whether the equipment delivers protons via the scattering method (historically, the most common) or a spot scanning method. Spot scanning can adjust the width of the SOBP on a spot-by-spot basis, which reduces the volume of normal (healthy) tissue inside the high dose region. Also, spot scanning allows for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), which determines individual spot intensities using an optimization algorithm that lets the user balance the competing goals of irradiating tumors while sparing normal tissue. Spot scanning availability depends on the machine and the institution. Spot scanning is more commonly known as pencil-beam scanning and is available on IBA, Hitachi, Mevion (known as HYPERSCAN which became US FDA approved in 2017) and Varian.

===Surgery===
Physicians base the decision to use surgery or proton therapy (or any radiation therapy) on tumor type, stage, and location. Sometimes surgery is superior (such as cutaneous melanoma), sometimes radiation is superior (such as skull base chondrosarcoma), and sometimes are comparable (for example, prostate cancer). Sometimes, they are used together (e.g., rectal cancer or early stage breast cancer).

The benefit of external beam proton radiation is in the dosimetric difference from external beam X-ray radiation and brachytherapy in cases where use of radiation therapy is already indicated, rather than as a direct competition with surgery. In prostate cancer, the most common indication for proton beam therapy, no clinical study directly comparing proton therapy to surgery, brachytherapy, or other treatments has shown any clinical benefit for proton beam therapy. Indeed, the largest study to date showed that IMRT compared with proton therapy was associated with less gastrointestinal morbidity.

==Side effects and risks==
Proton therapy is a type of external beam radiotherapy, and shares risks and side effects of other forms of radiation therapy. The dose outside of the treatment region can be significantly less for deep-tissue tumors than X-ray therapy, because proton therapy takes full advantage of the Bragg peak. Proton therapy has been in use for over 40 years, and is a mature technology. As with all medical knowledge, understanding of the interaction of radiations with tumor and normal tissue is still imperfect.

==Costs==
Historically, proton therapy has been expensive. An analysis published in 2003 found that the cost of proton therapy is ≈2.4 times that of X-ray therapies. Newer, less expensive, and dozens more proton treatment centers are driving costs down and they offer more accurate three-dimensional targeting. Higher proton dosage over fewer treatments sessions (1/3 fewer or less) is also driving costs down. Thus the cost is expected to reduce as better proton technology becomes more widely available. An analysis published in 2005 determined that the cost of proton therapy is not unrealistic and should not be the reason for denying patients access to the technology. In some clinical situations, proton beam therapy is clearly superior to the alternatives.

A study in 2007 expressed concerns about the effectiveness of proton therapy for prostate cancer, but with the advent of new developments in the technology, such as improved scanning techniques and more precise dose delivery (&#x27;pencil beam scanning&#x27;), this situation may change considerably. Amitabh Chandra, a health economist at Harvard University, said, &quot;Proton-beam therapy is like the Death Star of American medical technology... It&#x27;s a metaphor for all the problems we have in American medicine.&quot; Proton therapy is cost-effective for some types of cancer, but not all. In particular, some other treatments offer better overall value for treatment of prostate cancer.

As of 2018, the cost of a single-room particle therapy system is US$40 million, with multi-room systems costing up to US$200 million.

==Treatment centers==

As of August 2020, there are over 89 particle therapy facilities worldwide, with at least 41 others under construction. As of August 2020, there are 34 operational proton therapy centers in the United States. As of the end of 2015 more than 154,203 patients had been treated worldwide.

One hindrance to universal use of the proton in cancer treatment is the size and cost of the cyclotron or synchrotron equipment necessary. Several industrial teams are working on development of comparatively small accelerator systems to deliver the proton therapy to patients. Among the technologies being investigated are superconducting synchrocyclotrons (also known as FM Cyclotrons), ultra-compact synchrotrons, dielectric wall accelerators, and linear particle accelerators.

===United States===
Proton treatment centers in the United States (in chronological order of first treatment date) include:

The Indiana University Health Proton Therapy Center in Bloomington, Indiana opened in 2004 and ceased operations in 2014.

=== Outside the US ===
====Australia====
In July 2020, construction began for &quot;SAHMRI 2&quot;, the second building for the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute. The building will house the Australian Bragg Centre for Proton Therapy &amp; Research, a addition to the largest health and biomedical precinct in the Southern Hemisphere, Adelaide&#x27;s BioMed City. The proton therapy unit is being supplied by ProTom International, which will install its Radiance 330 proton therapy system, the same system used at Massachusetts General Hospital. When in full operation, it will have the ability to treat approximately 600-700 patients per year with around half of these expected to be children and young adults. The facility is expected to be completed in late 2023, with its first patients treated in 2025. In 2024 the South Australian government expressed concerns about the delivery of the project.

====India====
Apollo Proton Cancer Centre (APCC) in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, a unit under Apollo Hospitals, is a Cancer specialty hospital. APCC is the only cancer hospital in India with Joint Commission International accreditation.

====Israel====
In January 2020, it was announced that a proton therapy center would be built in Ichilov Hospital, at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center. The project&#x27;s construction was fully funded by donations. It will have two treatment rooms. According to a newspaper report in 2023, it should be ready in three to four years. The report also mentions that &quot;Proton therapy for cancer treatment has arrived in Israel and the Middle East with a clinical trial underway that sees Hadassah Medical Center partnering with P-Cure, an Israeli company that has developed a unique system designed to fit into existing hospital settings&quot;.

====Spain====
In October 2021, the Amancio Ortega Foundation arranged with the Spanish government and several autonomous communities to donate 280 million euros to install ten proton accelerators in the public health system.

====United Kingdom====

In 2013 the British government announced that £250 million had been budgeted to establish two centers for advanced radiotherapy: The Christie NHS Foundation Trust (the Christie Hospital) in Manchester, which opened in 2018; and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which opened in 2021. These offer high-energy proton therapy, and other types of advanced radiotherapy, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). In 2014, only low-energy proton therapy was available in the UK, at Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS Foundation Trust in Merseyside. But NHS England has paid to have suitable cases treated abroad, mostly in the US. Such cases rose from 18 in 2008 to 122 in 2013, 99 of whom were children. The cost to the National Health Service averaged ~£100,000 per case.

<doc id="1164552" wikidata="Q7886813" url="?curid=1164552" title="Unionism in Scotland">
<text>Unionism in Scotland () is a political movement which favours the continuation of the political union between Scotland and the other countries of the United Kingdom (England, Wales and Northern Ireland), and hence is opposed to Scottish independence. Scotland is one of four countries of the United Kingdom which has its own devolved government and Scottish Parliament, as well as representation in the UK Parliament. There are many strands of political Unionism in Scotland, some of which have ties to Unionism and Loyalism in Northern Ireland. The two main political parties in the UK — the Conservatives and Labour — both support Scotland remaining part of the UK.

The Scottish unionism movement consists of many factions with varying political views but which are united in being politically opposed to Scottish independence, which would mean Scotland leaving the UK and becoming an independent state. Political parties which support Scottish independence include: the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Scottish Greens. The SNP have formed the devolved Scottish Government since 2007. After the SNP won an overall majority in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the UK and Scottish governments agreed to hold a referendum on Scottish independence, which was held on 18 September 2014. The three main UK political parties formed the Better Together campaign, supporting Scotland remaining part of the UK. The referendum resulted in a victory for the &quot;No&quot; (unionist) campaign, with 55.3% of votes cast for &quot;No&quot; to Scottish independence, and 44.7% cast for &quot;Yes&quot; to Scottish independence.

After the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the cross-party Better Together campaign ceased to be active. In its place now exists Scotland in Union (SIU), Scotland&#x27;s largest and most active pro-UK campaign. Scotland in Union was launched in March 2015 with the aim of promoting Scotland&#x27;s place in the UK. People who had supported Better Together in the 2014 referendum set up the campaign as a response to the continued, high-profile push for independence by Scottish nationalists after the referendum result. Initially, the organisation was led by its founder Alastair Cameron, a former Army captain. In January 2017, Scottish Labour&#x27;s former Justice spokesperson Graeme Pearson was announced as Chief Executive. In August 2017, former Labour MP Pamela Nash took over the role.

==Status of the term==
Before its merger with the Conservative and Unionist Party in England and Wales in 1965, the Unionist Party in Scotland was often known simply as &quot;Unionist&quot;. Both the Conservative and Unionist and Scottish Unionist parties were formed by the merger of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists in 1912. The union referred to is the 1800 Act of Union (between Great Britain and Ireland), not the Acts of Union 1707 (between England and Scotland).

The term may also be used to suggest an affinity with Northern Irish unionism.

The former Secretary of State for Scotland, Michael Moore, has written that he does not call himself a Unionist, despite being a supporter of the union. This he ascribes to the Liberal Democrat position in regard to Home Rule and decentralisation within the United Kingdom, noting that: &quot;for me the concept of &#x27;Unionism&#x27; does not capture the devolution journey on which we have travelled in recent years.&quot; He suggests the connotations behind Unionism are of adherence to a constitutional status quo.

==History of the Union==
===Kingdom of Scotland===

Scotland emerged as an independent polity during the Early Middle Ages, with some historians dating its foundation from the reign of Kenneth MacAlpin in 843. The independence of the Kingdom of Scotland was fought over between Scottish kings and by the Norman and Angevin rulers of England. A key period in the Kingdom of Scotland&#x27;s history was a succession crisis that started in 1290, when Edward I of England claimed the Scottish throne. The resulting wars of Scottish Independence which led to Scotland securing its independent status, with Robert the Bruce (crowned in 1306) winning a major confrontation at Bannockburn in 1314.

England, Ireland and Scotland shared the same monarch in a personal union from 1603, when King James VI of Scotland also became King James I of England and Ireland, resulting in the &quot;Union of the Crowns&quot;. A political union between the Kingdoms of Scotland, England and Ireland was temporarily formed when the crowns were overthrown as a result of the English Civil War, with Oliver Cromwell ruling over the whole of Great Britain and Ireland as Lord Protector. This period was known as the Protectorate, or to monarchists as the interregnum. The monarchies were subsequently restored in 1660, with Scotland reverting to an independent kingdom sharing the same monarch as England and Ireland.

===Union between England and Scotland (1707)===

The political union between the Kingdoms of Scotland and England (also including Wales) was created by the Acts of Union, passed in the parliaments of both kingdoms in 1707 and 1706 respectively. Causes for this included English fears that Scotland would select a different (Catholic) monarch in future, and the failure of the Scottish colony at Darien.

The Union was brought into existence under the Acts of Union on 1 May 1707, forming a single Kingdom of Great Britain. Scottish Jacobite resistance to the union, led by descendants of James VII of Scotland (II of England), continued until 1746 and the Jacobite defeat at Culloden.

===Union with Ireland (1801)===

With the Acts of Union 1800, Ireland united with Great Britain into what then formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The history of the Unions is reflected in various stages of the Union Flag, which forms the flag of the United Kingdom. Ireland was partitioned in the early 1920s: Southern Ireland, now known as the Republic of Ireland, left the United Kingdom, while Northern Ireland chose to stay within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

===Devolution (1999)===

The Liberal Democrats, and their predecessor Liberal Party, have long been supportive of Home Rule as part of a wider belief in subsidiarity and localism. In a mirror image of how the Liberal Democrat Party is itself structured, that party is generally supportive of a federal relationship between the countries of the United Kingdom. The Liberal governments of the late 19th century and early 20th century supported a &quot;home rule all round&quot; policy, which would have meant creating national parliaments in England, Ireland and Scotland with common and external matters (such as defence and foreign affairs) decided by the UK Parliament. A &quot;Government Of Scotland Bill&quot; was introduced to the UK Parliament by the Liberal government in 1913, and its second reading was passed in the House of Commons by 204 votes to 159. The bill did not become law, and home rule fell off the agenda after most of Ireland became independent in 1922.

Following the Kilbrandon Report in 1973, recommending a devolved Scottish Assembly, the Labour government led by Jim Callaghan introduced the Scotland Act 1978. A majority voted in favour of the proposed scheme in a March 1979 referendum on the proposal, but the Act stipulated that 40% of the total electorate had to vote in favour. The result of the referendum did not meet this additional test, and the Labour government decided not to press ahead with devolution. When the party returned to power in 1997, they introduced a second devolution referendum which resulted in the enactment of the Scotland Act 1998 and the creation of the Scottish Parliament.

Unionists took different sides on the debates regarding devolution. Supporters argued that it would strengthen the Union, as giving Scotland self-government would remove the contention that independence was the only way to obtain control over internal affairs. Labour politician George Robertson said that devolution &quot;will kill nationalism stone dead&quot; for this reason. John Smith, a Labour leader who supported devolution, believed it was the &quot;settled will&quot; of the Scottish people. Unionist opponents of devolution argued that granting self-government would inevitably lead to the Union breaking, as they believed it would encourage nationalist sentiment and create tensions within the Union. Labour politician Tam Dalyell said devolution would be a &quot;motorway to independence&quot;. His West Lothian question asked why MPs for Scottish constituencies should be able to decide devolved matters (such as health and education) in England, but MPs for English constituencies would have no say over those matters in Scotland.

The Conservatives, as a Britain-wide party, fielded candidates in Scotland until the creation of a separate Unionist Party in 1912. This was a separate party which accepted the Conservative whip in the UK Parliament until it was merged into the Conservative Party in 1965. The Declaration of Perth policy document of 1968 committed the Conservatives to Scottish devolution in some form, and in 1970 the Conservative government published &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Government&quot;, a document recommending the creation of a Scottish Assembly. Support for devolution within the party was rejected and was opposed by the Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major in the 1980s and 1990s. The party largely remained opposed to devolution in the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum campaign. That referendum was passed with a large majority, the Conservatives have since accepted devolution in both Scotland and Wales. The governments led by David Cameron devolved further powers to the Scottish Parliament in 2012 and 2016. Cameron also attempted to answer the &quot;West Lothian question&quot; by changing the procedures of the UK Parliament (English votes for English laws).

Notable opponents of unionism are the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Scottish Green Party. The Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and Solidarity seek to make Scotland an independent sovereign state and a republic separate from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of these parties, only the SNP currently has representation in the UK Parliament, which it has had continuously since winning the 1967 Hamilton by-election. The SNP and the Scottish Greens both have representation within the Scottish Parliament, with the SNP having formed the Scottish Government since 2007.

===Independence referendum (2014)===

The SNP won an overall majority in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. Following that election, the UK and Scottish Governments agreed that the Scottish Parliament should be given the legal authority to hold an independence referendum by the end of 2014.

The referendum was held on 18 September 2014, asking voters in Scotland the following question: &quot;Should Scotland be an independent country?&quot;. At the poll, 2,001,926 voters (55%) rejected the proposal for Scotland to become an independent state over 1,617,989 (45%), who voted in favour of Scottish independence.

The referendum result was accepted by the Scottish and British governments, leading to Scotland remaining a devolved part of the United Kingdom. Further moves have since been made towards increased devolution of power to the Scottish Parliament, which has been incorporated into UK law via the Scotland Act of 2016.

===Subsequent elections===
Following the September 2014 referendum, the pro-independence SNP benefitted from increased membership and political support. In the 2015 general election, the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats contested in Scotland, with the three main British parties winning one seat each. The pro-unionist Scottish Conservatives then also saw increased support in the 2016 Scottish Parliament and 2017 UK general elections.

Before the latter election, the Scottish Government (formed by the SNP) had proposed a second Scottish independence referendum, due to the &quot;Leave&quot; victory in the June 2016 referendum on UK membership of the European Union, which the majority of voters in Scotland voted against. The SNP won 35 seats in the 2017 UK general election, a loss of 21 from the 2015 election, with their vote dropping from 50% in 2015 to 37%.

In the 2019 UK general election, SNP support increased to 45% of the vote and they won 48 of the 59 seats contested in Scotland. The election was focused around Brexit, as the Conservative government led by Boris Johnson pledged to &quot;get Brexit done&quot;. Despite losing seats in Scotland, the Conservatives won an overall majority and the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.

The 2024 general election saw a resurgence of the Unionist Labour Party within Scotland, with the party winning 37 of the 57 Scottish seats at Westminster. The other Unionist parties, the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrats, lost 1 seat and gained 4 seats, respectively. The pro-independence Scottish National Party, meanwhile, the dominant party in Scotland since 2007, saw a collapse of support and lost 40% of its vote share and 39 seats, bringing their total from 48 seats to nine.

==Demographics==
An academic study surveying 5,000 Scots following the referendum in 2014, found that the &quot;No&quot; campaign performed strongest among elderly, Protestant and middle-income voters. The study also found that the &quot;No&quot; campaign polled ahead among young voters aged between 16 and 24, whilst the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign performed better among men, Roman Catholic voters and voters aged between 25 and 34 years old.

According to Professor John Curtice, polling evidence indicates that support for independence was highest among those aged in their late-20s and early-30s, with a higher &quot;No&quot; vote among those aged between 16 and 24. There was an age gap at the referendum, with elderly voters being the most likely to vote against independence and younger voters aged under 55, with the exception of those aged between 16 and 24, generally being more in favour of independence. Those in C2DE, or &quot;working class&quot;, occupations were slightly more likely to vote in favour of independence than those in ABC1, or &quot;middle class&quot;, occupations, however, there was a significant discrepancy in voting between those living in the most deprived areas and those living in the least deprived areas, with those in more deprived areas being significantly more likely to vote in favour of independence and those in more affluent areas being more likely to vote against independence. This has been picked up by other academics, with data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation study from 2012 indicating that the six most deprived local authorities in Scotland returned the highest &quot;Yes&quot; vote shares at the referendum.

===Geography===

At the referendum a total of 4 out of 32 council areas voted in favour of independence, these being: North Lanarkshire (51.1% Yes), Glasgow (53.5% Yes), West Dunbartonshire (54.0% Yes) and Dundee (57.3% Yes). The largest No votes were returned by Orkney (67.2% No), Scottish Borders (66.6% No), Dumfries and Galloway (65.7% No) and Shetland (63.7% No).
Generally, the Yes campaign performed strongly in deprived urban settings, such as in Greater Glasgow and Dundee, with the No campaign performing better in affluent rural and suburban areas, such as in Aberdeenshire and East Renfrewshire. The campaign saw large shifts in favour of independence in areas traditionally held by Scottish Labour at the Scottish and UK Parliaments, with the Yes campaign performing strongly in Red Clydeside. The No campaign performed better in affluent areas traditionally held by the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives such as in East Dunbartonshire and the Scottish Borders. Surprisingly, the No campaign were able to secure a set of sizeable majorities in some council areas which have traditionally voted for the SNP, such as in Moray and Angus, where the &quot;No&quot; vote was 57.6% and 56.3% respectively.

===Religion===
Public opinion polling conducted by Lord Ashcroft after the Scottish independence referendum found that approximately 70% of Scotland&#x27;s Protestant population voted against Scottish independence whereas 57% of Roman Catholics voted in favour of Scottish independence.

===National identity===

&quot;British&quot; national identity forms a significant part of the unionist movement in Scotland, with the vast majority of those identifying their national identity more as &quot;British&quot; being in favour of Scotland remaining a part of the United Kingdom, with a smaller majority of those identifying their national identity more as &quot;Scottish&quot; supporting Scottish independence. However, many independence supporters also identify as &quot;British&quot; in varying degrees, with a majority of those describing their national identity as &quot;More Scottish than British&quot; being supportive of Scottish independence.

A question on national identity was asked in the 2011 UK Census: &quot;what do you feel is your national identity?&quot;. Respondents could identify themselves as having more than one national identity.

In the 2011 UK Census:
*62% identified themselves as &#x27;Scottish only&#x27;
*18% identified themselves as &#x27;Scottish&#x27; and &#x27;British&#x27;
*8% identified themselves as &#x27;British only&#x27;
*2% identified themselves as &#x27;Scottish&#x27; together with some other identity.
*the remainder chose other national identities.

The council areas with at least 90% of the population stating some &#x27;Scottish&#x27; national identity were North Lanarkshire, Inverclyde, East Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire. The lowest proportions of people stating some &#x27;Scottish&#x27; national identity were in Edinburgh (70%) and Aberdeen (75%).

The council areas with the highest proportions of people stating &#x27;British&#x27; as their only national identity were Argyll and Bute and Shetland, each with 12%.

Below is a table of national identity sorted by council area based on the results of the 2011 census:
====Scottish Social Attitudes Survey====
Below are findings from the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, which is an annual survey of public opinion in Scotland from a representative sample of 1,200–1,500 people conducted in conjunction with organisations such as the BBC and various governmental departments, such as the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills.

=====&#x27;Moreno&#x27; national identity=====
Respondents were asked to select the &quot;National identity that best describes the way respondent thinks of themselves?&quot;


=====Forced choice=====
Respondents were asked to select the &quot;National identity that best describes the way respondent thinks of themselves?&quot;
=====Trends=====
British national identity entered a sharp decline in Scotland from 1979 until the advent of devolution in 1999, with the proportion of respondents in Scotland identifying their national identity as British falling from 39% in 1979 to just 17% in 1999, hitting an all-time-low of 13% in 2000. Since then, there has been a gradual increase in British national identity and a decline in Scottish national identity, with British national identity hitting a twenty-year high in Scotland in 2013 at 24% and Scottish national identity hitting a 35-year low the following year at 65%. Polling conducted since 2014 has indicated that British national identity has risen to between 31 and 36% in Scotland and that Scottish national identity has fallen to between 58 and 62%.

==Recent election results==
2024 United Kingdom general election

Main article: 2024 United Kingdom general election in Scotland

In the 2024 United Kingdom general election, unionist parties received 67.6% of the vote and won 48 out of 57 seats. 

===2019 United Kingdom general election===

In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the pro-independence Scottish National Party won 45% of the vote share in Scotland (an increase of 8.1% from the previous election) and 48 of the 59 seats contested in Scotland (a net increase of 13). Notable casualties for unionist parties included Jo Swinson, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, who lost her seat in the East Dunbartonshire constituency to the SNP and this resulted in her resigning the party leadership. The Conservatives won six seats (down seven from the previous election), Liberal Democrats four and Labour one (Edinburgh South).

===2016 Scottish Parliament election===

The SNP won 63 seats of 129 available in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election. This meant that they continued in government, but no longer had an overall majority (which they had won in 2011). As the pro-independence Scottish Greens won six seats, there was still a majority of members in favour of Scottish independence. The Scottish Conservatives won 31 seats, overtaking Scottish Labour as the main opposition party in the devolved Parliament. Labour won 24 seats and finished in third place, and the Scottish Liberal Democrats won 5 seats.

==Organisations who support the Union==
=== Political parties ===

* All for Unity
* Abolish the Scottish Parliament
* Britain First
* British National Party
* Democratic Unionist Party 
*Co-operative Party
* Liberal Democrats
* Liberal Party
* Progressive Unionist Party 
* Reform UK
* Conservative and Unionist Party
* Labour Party
* Scottish Unionist Party
* Social Democratic Party
* Traditional Unionist Voice 
* UK Independence Party
* Ulster Unionist Party

Of the above parties, the three largest and most significant political parties that support the Union are the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservative and Unionist Party, all of which organise and stand in elections across Great Britain and hold representation in both the Scottish and UK Parliaments. These three parties have philosophical differences about what Scotland&#x27;s status should be, particularly in their support of devolution (historically Home Rule) or federalism.

===Other groups===

The Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland also supports the continuation of the Union. In March 2007, the Lodge organised a march of 12,000 of its members through Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Mile to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the Union. The high turnout was believed to be in part due to opposition to Scottish independence. The Orange Order used the opportunity to speak out against the possibility of nationalists increasing their share of the vote in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. In the run up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the Orange Order held a Unionist march and rally in Edinburgh which involved 15,000 Orangemen, loyalist bands and no voters from across Scotland and the UK.

During the 2014 referendum campaign, a pro-Union rally by the &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together Campaign&quot; was held in London&#x27;s Trafalgar Square, where 5,000 people gathered to urge Scotland to vote &quot;No&quot; to independence. Similar events were held in other cities across the rest of the United Kingdom, including in Manchester, Belfast and Cardiff.

===Ties to Unionism in Northern Ireland===

There is some degree of social and political co-operation between some Scottish unionists and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity with the United Kingdom. For example, the Orange Order parades in Orange walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. This is largely concentrated in the Central Belt and west of Scotland. A unionist rally was held in Belfast in response to the referendum on Scottish independence. Northern Irish unionists gathered to urge Scottish voters to remain within the United Kingdom.

<text>Malmberget (&quot;The Ore Mountain&quot;, Finnish and Meänkieli: &quot;Malmivaara&quot;) is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden. It had 5,590 inhabitants in 2010, reduced to 927 by December 2020. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat of Gällivare.

The entire Malmberget town was moved in 2020/2021 due to mining activities in the area.

Malmberget is known as a major site for the extraction of iron ore from deep mines by Swedish mining company LKAB. Iron ore mining started in 1741 at Illuvaara mountain, later known as &quot;Gällivare Malmberg&quot; and eventually just &quot;Malmberget&quot;. The first train transporting iron ore was loaded in 1888 - the beginning of the great iron ore rush that would change the entire area of Northern Lapland. In Malmberget there was plentiful employment, but no dwellings - a striking resemblance to the conditions during some of the gold rushes in North America. During the first years, workers lived in shacks built from waste dynamite crates.

In the centre of Malmberget, the deep mine has reached daylight and created a large hole called &quot;Kaptensgropen&quot; (&quot;The Captain&#x27;s Pit&quot;). In March 2012, &quot;Kaptensgropen&quot; was joined with a new pit resulting from the planned sub-level caving of the Fabian deposit, and has grown southwards as the deep mining continues, dividing the town and making the old town centre uninhabitable, forcing many institutions, such as two cinemas and a church, to move to the western part of Malmberget or, even more commonly, to the neighbouring town of Gällivare.

Today &quot;Kaptensgropen&quot; is being back-filled with waste rock produced by the underground mines. &quot;Kaptensgropen&quot; will eventually be filled in, but the uninhabitable area is continually growing as underground mining undermines the area and seismic events caused by the mining regularly shake the remaining parts of Malmberget. The future of Malmberget was for a long time uncertain, but exploration by LKAB indicated that even more of Malmberget may need to be moved in the future. The moving of several large residential houses owned by the mining company, as well as private villas, has been a major issue locally for the past few years.

The iron ore extracted from Malmberget is transported by rail southeast to the port of Luleå.

==Sports==
Malmberget&#x27;s largest sports association is named Malmbergets allmänna idrottsförening (MAIF) which has an athletic tradition spanning more than a hundred years. MAIF&#x27;s colors are green and white.

The local football club is Gällivare Malmbergets FF. 

The famous Track and field athlete, Ruth Svedberg, was born here

<text>Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is a surgical procedure in which a portion of the sympathetic nerve trunk in the thoracic region is destroyed. ETS is used to treat excessive sweating in certain parts of the body (focal hyperhidrosis), facial flushing, Raynaud&#x27;s disease and reflex sympathetic dystrophy. By far the most common complaint treated with ETS is sweaty palms (palmar hyperhidrosis). The intervention is controversial and illegal in some jurisdictions. Like any surgical procedure, it has risks; the endoscopic sympathetic block (ESB) procedure and those procedures that affect fewer nerves have lower risks.

Sympathectomy physically destroys relevant nerves anywhere in either of the two sympathetic trunks, which are long chains of nerve ganglia located bilaterally along the vertebral column (a localisation which entails a low risk of injury) responsible for various important aspects of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Each nerve trunk is broadly divided into three regions: cervical (neck), thoracic (chest), and lumbar (lower back). The most common area targeted in sympathectomy is the upper thoracic region, that part of the sympathetic chain lying between the first and fifth thoracic vertebrae.

==Indications==
The most common indications for thoracic sympathectomy are focal hyperhidrosis (that specifically affects the hands and underarms), Raynaud syndrome, and facial blushing when accompanied by focal hyperhidrosis. It may also be used to treat bromhidrosis, although this usually responds to non-surgical treatments, and sometimes people with olfactory reference syndrome present to surgeons requesting sympathectomy.

There are reports of ETS being used to achieve cerebral revascularization for people with moyamoya disease, and to treat headaches, hyperactive bronchial tubes, long QT syndrome, social phobia, anxiety, and other conditions.

==Surgical procedure==

ETS involves dissection of the main sympathetic trunk in the upper thoracic region of the sympathetic nervous system, irreparably disrupting neural messages that ordinarily would travel to many different organs, glands and muscles. It is via those nerves that the brain is able to make adjustments to the body in response to changing conditions in the environment, fluctuating emotional states, level of exercise, and other factors to maintain the body in its ideal state (see homeostasis).

Because these nerves also regulate conditions like excessive blushing or sweating, which the procedure is designed to eliminate, the normative functions these physiological mechanisms perform will be disabled or significantly impaired by sympathectomy.

There is much disagreement among ETS surgeons about the best surgical method, optimal location for nerve dissection, and the nature and extent of the consequent primary effects and side effects. When performed endoscopically as is usually the case, the surgeon penetrates the chest cavity making multiple incisions about the diameter of a straw between ribs. This allows the surgeon to insert the video camera (endoscope) in one hole and a surgical instrument in another. The operation is accomplished by dissecting the nerve tissue of the main sympathetic chain.

Another technique, the clamping method, also referred to as &#x27;endoscopic sympathetic blockade&#x27; (ESB) employs titanium clamps around the nerve tissue, and was developed as an alternative to older methods in an unsuccessful attempt to make the procedure reversible. Technical reversal of the clamping procedure must be performed within a short time after clamping (estimated at a few days or weeks at most), and a recovery, evidence indicates, will not be complete.

==Physical, mental and emotional effects==

Sympathectomy works by disabling part of the autonomic nervous system (and thereby disrupting its signals from the brain), through surgical intervention, in the expectation of removing or alleviating the designated problem. Many non-ETS doctors have found this practice questionable chiefly because its purpose is to destroy functionally disordered, yet anatomically typical nerves.

Exact results of ETS are impossible to predict, because of considerable anatomic variation in nerve function from one patient to the next, and also because of variations in surgical technique. The autonomic nervous system is not anatomically exact and connections might exist which are unpredictably affected when the nerves are disabled. This problem was demonstrated by a significant number of patients who underwent sympathectomy at the same level for hand sweating, but who then presented a reduction or elimination of feet sweating, in contrast to others who were not affected in this way. No reliable operation exists for foot sweating except lumbar sympathectomy, at the opposite end of the sympathetic chain.

Thoracic sympathectomy will change many bodily functions, including sweating, vascular responses, heart rate, heart stroke volume, thyroid, baroreflex, lung volume, pupil dilation, skin temperature and other aspects of the autonomic nervous system, like the essential fight-or-flight response. It reduces the physiological responses to strong emotions, such as fear and laughter, diminishes the body&#x27;s physical reaction to both pain and pleasure, and inhibits cutaneous sensations such as goose bumps.

A large study of psychiatric patients treated with this surgery showed significant reductions in fear, alertness and arousal. Arousal is essential to consciousness, in regulating attention and information processing, memory and emotion.

ETS patients are being studied using the autonomic failure protocol headed by David Goldstein, M.D. Ph.D., senior investigator at the U.S National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He has documented loss of thermoregulatory function, cardiac denervation, and loss of vasoconstriction.
Recurrence of the original symptoms due to nerve regeneration or nerve sprouting can occur within the first year post surgery. Nerve sprouting, or abnormal nerve growth after damage or injury to the nerves can cause other further damage. Sprouting sympathetic nerves can form connections with sensory nerves, and lead to pain conditions that are mediated by the SNS. Every time the system is activated, it is translated into pain. This sprouting and its action can lead to Frey&#x27;s syndrome, a recognized after effect of sympathectomy, when the growing sympathetic nerves innervate salivary glands, leading to excessive sweating regardless of environmental temperature through olfactory or gustatory stimulation.

In addition, patients have reported lethargy, depression, weakness, limb swelling, lack of libido, decreased physical and mental reactivity, oversensitivity to sound, light and stress and weight gain (British Journal of Surgery 2004; 91: 264–269).

== Risks ==
ETS has both the normal risks of surgery, such as bleeding and infection, conversion to open chest surgery, and several specific risks, including permanent and unavoidable alteration of nerve function. It is reported that a number of patients - 9 since 2010, mostly young women - have died during this procedure due to major intrathoracic bleeding and cerebral disruption. Bleeding during and following the operation may be significant in up to 5% of patients. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) can occur (2% of patients). Compensatory hyperhidrosis (or reflex hyperhidrosis) is common over the long term. The rates of severe compensatory sweating vary widely between studies, ranging from as high as 92% of patients. Of those patients that develop this side effect, about a quarter in one study said it was a major and disabling problem. 35% of people affected have to change their clothes several times a day as a result.

A severe possible consequence of thoracic sympathectomy is corposcindosis (split-body syndrome), in which the patient feels that they are living in two separate bodies, because sympathetic nerve function has been divided into two distinct regions, one dead, and the other hyperactive.

Additionally, the following side effects have all been reported by patients: Chronic muscular pain, numbness and weakness of the limbs, Horner&#x27;s Syndrome, anhidrosis (inability to sweat), hyperthermia (exacerbated by anhidrosis and systemic thermoregulatory dysfunction), neuralgia, paraesthesia, fatigue and amotivationality, breathing difficulties, substantially diminished physiological/chemical reaction to internal and environmental stimuli, somatosensory malfunction, aberrant physiological reaction to stress and exertion, Raynaud’s disease (albeit a possible indication for surgery), reflex hyperhidrosis, altered/erratic blood pressure and circulation, defective fight or flight response system, loss of adrenaline, eczema and other skin conditions resulting from exceptionally dry skin, rhinitis, gustatory sweating (also known as Frey&#x27;s syndrome).
Other long-term adverse effects include:
* Ultrastructural changes in the cerebral artery wall induced by long-term sympathetic denervation
* Sympathectomy eliminates the psychogalvanic reflex
* Cervical sympathectomy reduces the heterogeneity of oxygen saturation in small cerebrocortical veins
* Sympathetic denervation is one of the causes of Mönckeberg&#x27;s sclerosis
* T2-3 sympathectomy suppressed baroreflex control of heart rate in the patients with palmar hyperhidrosis. The baroreflex response for maintaining cardiovascular stability is suppressed in the patients who received the ETS.
* Exertional heat stroke.
* Morphofunctional changes in the myocardium following sympathectomy.

Other side effects are the inability to raise the heart rate sufficiently during exercise with instances requiring an artificial pacemaker after developing bradycardia being reported as a consequence of the surgery.

The Finnish Office for Health Care Technology Assessment concluded more than a decade ago in a 400-page systematic review that ETS is associated with an unusually high number of significant immediate and long-term adverse effects.

Quoting the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare statement: &quot;The method can give permanent side effects that in some cases will first become obvious only after some time. One of the side effects might be increased perspiration on different places on your body. Why and how this happens is still unknown. According to the research available about 25-75% of all patients can expect more or less serious perspiration on different places on their body, such as the trunk and groin area, this is &quot;Compensatory sweating&quot;&quot;.

In 2003, ETS was banned in its birthplace, Sweden, due to inherent risks, and complaints by disabled patients. In 2004, Taiwanese health authorities banned the procedure on people under 20 years of age.

==History==
Sympathectomy developed in the mid-19th century, when it was learned that the autonomic nervous system runs to almost every organ, gland and muscle system in the body. It was surmised that these nerves play a role in how the body regulates many different body functions in response to changes in the external environment, and in emotion.

The first sympathectomy was performed by Alexander in 1889. Thoracic sympathectomy has been indicated for hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) since 1920, when Kotzareff showed it would cause anhidrosis (total inability to sweat) from the nipple line upwards.

A lumbar sympathectomy was also developed and used to treat excessive sweating of the feet and other ailments, and typically resulted in impotence and retrograde ejaculation in men. Lumbar sympathectomy is still being offered as a treatment for plantar hyperhidrosis, or as a treatment for patients who have a bad outcome (extreme &#x27;compensatory sweating&#x27;) after thoracic sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis or blushing; however, extensive sympathectomy risks hypotension.

Endoscopic sympathectomy itself is relatively easy to perform; however, accessing the nerve tissue in the chest cavity by conventional surgical methods was difficult, painful, and spawned several different approaches in the past. The posterior approach was developed in 1908, and required resection (sawing off) of ribs. A supraclavicular (above the collar-bone) approach was developed in 1935, which was less painful than the posterior, but was more prone to damaging delicate nerves and blood vessels. Because of these difficulties, and because of disabling sequelae associated with sympathetic denervation, conventional or &quot;open&quot; sympathectomy was never a popular procedure, although it continued to be practiced for hyperhidrosis, Raynaud&#x27;s disease, and various psychiatric disorders. With the brief popularization of lobotomy in the 1940s, sympathectomy fell out of favor as a form of psychosurgery.

The endoscopic version of thoracic sympathectomy was pioneered by Goren Claes and Christer Drott in Sweden in the late 1980s. The development of endoscopic &quot;minimally invasive&quot; surgical techniques has decreased the recovery time from the surgery and increased its availability. Today, ETS surgery is practiced in many countries throughout the world predominantly by vascular surgeons.

<text>Karel Jaromír Erben (; 7 November 1811 – 21 November 1870) was a Czech folklorist and poet of the mid-19th century, best known for his collection &quot;Kytice&quot;, which contains poems based on traditional and folkloric themes.

He also wrote &quot;Písně národní v Čechách&quot; (&quot;Folk Songs of Bohemia&quot;) which contains 500 songs and &quot;Prostonárodní české písně a říkadla&quot; (&quot;Czech Folk Songs and Nursery Rhymes&quot;), a five-part book that brings together most of Czech folklore.

==Biography==
He was born on 7 November 1811 in Miletín near Jičín. He went to college in Hradec Králové. Then, in 1831, he went to 
Prague where he studied philosophy and later law. He started working in the National Museum with František Palacký in 1843. He became editor of a Prague&#x27;s newspaper in 1848. Two years later, in 1850, he became archives&#x27; secretary of the National Museum. He died on 21 November 1870 of tuberculosis.

He was member of the Czech National Revival, and politically he was also a sympathizer of Illyrian movement and Russian Slavophilia for entrenched populations of Slavs in other parts of the world.

As practitioner of his ideals, he published &quot;Sto prostonárodních pohádek a pověstí slovanských v nářečích původních&quot; (&quot;One Hundred Slavic Folk Tales and Legends in Original Dialects&quot;), also known by its subtitle &quot;Čitanka slovanská&quot; (&quot;Slavic Reader&quot;), that was influenced by the Grimms&#x27; collection of fairy tales. It included such pieces as tale No. 2, &quot;Dlouhý, Široký a Bystrozraký&quot; (&quot;Long, Broad and Sharpsight&quot;, translated into English by Albert Henry Wratislaw). The entire volume was translated by W. W. Strickland, and eventually published as &quot;Panslavonic Folk-lore&quot; in 1930.

He is also considered an important poet of the Czech literary Romanticism in the mid-19th century, with his collection of a dozen literary ballads entitled &quot;Kytice z pověstí národních&quot; (&quot;A Bouquet of Folk Legends&quot;, 1853).

<doc id="1164579" wikidata="Q60016" url="?curid=1164579" title="Kiss the Girls (1997 film)">
<text>Kiss the Girls is a 1997 American neo-noir psychological thriller film directed by Gary Fleder and starring Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Cary Elwes. The screenplay by David Klass is based on James Patterson&#x27;s best-selling 1995 novel of the same name. A sequel titled &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; was released in 2001.

==Plot==
Dr. Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist and detective from Washington D.C., is devastated to learn that his niece, Naomi, a college student in Durham, North Carolina, has been missing for four days. Despite his family’s anxiety, Cross travels to Durham to investigate, determined to find her.

Upon arrival, Cross meets with local police and learns that multiple young women, including Naomi, are missing. He collaborates with Detectives Nick Ruskin and Davey Sikes, as well as FBI agents. Together, they visit a crime scene in the woods where the body of one of the missing women has been found, brutally murdered and tied to a tree, heightening Cross’s fears for Naomi&#x27;s safety.

Meanwhile, Dr. Kate McTiernan, a doctor and kickboxer, is abducted from her home by a masked man who calls himself Casanova. She wakes up in a stone-walled room, heavily sedated, and is told by Casanova that he admires her talents and promises she won&#x27;t suffer if she complies with his rules. Kate, however, is determined to escape. She discovers other women are held captive with her.

Kate eventually manages to overpower Casanova during one of his visits and escapes into the woods, jumping off a cliff into a river to ensure her freedom. She is found and taken to a hospital, where she recovers and agrees to help Cross in his investigation. She provides vital information about her captivity and describes Casanova.

Cross investigates further and discovers that a plastic surgeon in California, Dr. William Rudolph, had suspiciously ordered a large quantity of Sistol, a benzodiazepine drug, which was used to sedate the captives. Travelling together to California, Cross and Kate join forces with Sampson, Cross&#x27; partner, and Henry, an LAPD Detective, to begin surveilling Rudolph.

After staking out Rudolph&#x27;s home, they follow him to a remote cabin in the woods. The investigation intensifies when they follow Rudolph to a nightclub. Kate, upon seeing Rudolph caress a woman&#x27;s cheek, recognizes his touch and, believing he is Casanova, alerts Cross. Rudolph takes the woman from the nightclub to his cabin, where a chase ensues when the group hears her screaming, during which Rudolph escapes after shooting one of Sampson’s men and injuring Cross.

At Rudolph&#x27;s home, the police uncover the identity of a second killer, named by the press as the Gentleman Caller. This killer is also involved in the abductions and is working in conjunction to and competition with Casanova. The two operate bicoastally, abducting women within days of one another and sharing images of their captives for the other to see. The police also discover a hidden freezer which contains mutilated body parts of his victims, distinguishing the Gentleman Caller&#x27;s MO from Casanova&#x27;s.

Back in North Carolina, with the help of Naomi’s boyfriend who is familiar with the area, Cross locates the hideout where the women are being held. Concurrently, Rudolph has also travelled to North Carolina, and has broken into Casanova&#x27;s lair. He enrages Casanova when he tries to undermine his control of Naomi and the other captive women, who shoots at Rudolph, but intentionally misses. Upon hearing Cross enter the hideout, Casanova tells Rudolph to flee. In a climactic confrontation, Cross and the police rescue the captives including Naomi. Rudolph is killed by Cross in an ensuing chase, but Casanova escapes.

The FBI raid the hideout, and locate Casanova&#x27;s fingerprints. Finally feeling safe, and with the belief that Casanova will be identified within a day, Kate invites Cross to her home for dinner before he returns back to D.C. Before Cross is due to arrive, Detective Ruskin arrives at Kate&#x27;s home to check in on her. She welcomes him inside and, whilst her back is turned, he cuts her phone line.

In the meantime, Cross recognizes a similarity between Casanova’s handwriting and Ruskin’s signature. Realizing Ruskin is Casanova, Cross rushes to save Kate. Ruskin, now revealed as Casanova, attempts to rape and kill Kate. A fight ensues, breaking a gas line in the kitchen. Realising this, Ruskin takes out a lighter, threatening to ignite it. Cross arrives just in time to intervene. In the final struggle, Cross shoots Ruskin through a milk carton, preventing him from causing an explosion in Kate’s house. Casanova is finally dead, and Cross and Kate embrace as the police arrive.

==Production==

===Filming===
Principal photography began on April 16, 1996. The film was shot two weeks on location in North Carolina on the streets of Durham, in nearby county parks, and outside a Chapel Hill, North Carolina residence. The police station was constructed in a downtown Durham warehouse. The majority of filming occurred in the Los Angeles area, with locations including the Disney Ranch, The Athenaeum at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, a house in the Adams historic district of Los Angeles, and on the campus of the University of Southern California in University Park. Designed by American production designer Nelson Coates, the majority of the sets, including the tunnels and underground chambers, were constructed in sound stages on the Paramount Studios lot. Filming was completed on July 10.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Deauville Film Festival in September 1997 before opening on 2,271 screens in the US the following month. It earned $13,215,167 in its opening weekend and a total of $60,527,873 in the US, ranking #28 in domestic revenue for the year.

The film was not shown in some theaters in central Virginia at the time of release, due to the unsolved murders of three teenage girls in the area. This decision was out of respect for the families and surrounding communities. The murders were eventually solved and attributed to Richard Evonitz.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the film &quot;is cut from the same cloth as &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;, but the piece of material it uses has the uneven shape and dangling threads of a discarded remnant... [It] begins promisingly, then loses its direction as the demand for accelerated action overtakes narrative logic&quot;. Holden writes of Morgan Freeman that he &quot;projects a kindness, patience and canny intelligence that cut against the movie&#x27;s fast pace and pumped-up shock effects. His performance is so measured it makes you want to believe in the movie much more than its gimmicky jerry-rigged &quot;[sic]&quot; plot ever permits&quot;.

In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four stars and said, &quot;David Klass, the screenwriter, gives Freeman and Judd more specific dialogue than is usual in thrillers; they sound as if they might actually be talking with each other and not simply advancing plot points... [They] are so good, you almost wish they&#x27;d decided not to make a thriller at all - had simply found a way to construct a drama exploring their personalities&quot;.

Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;a tense, scary, perversely creepy thriller&quot; and added that &quot;David Klass ... blessedly deletes the graphic descriptions of torture and rape included in the novel. Unfortunately, he also neglects to include any explanation of Casanova&#x27;s behavior. Otherwise &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. A solid second film from director Gary Fleder, it&#x27;s sure to set pulses racing and spines tingling&quot;. In the same newspaper, Desson Thomson felt that &quot;the movie ... operates on the crime-movie equivalent of automatic pilot. It takes off, flies and lands without much creative intervention&quot;.

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Peter Stack thought &quot;the story ... goes on too long. It has too many confusing plot twists and keeps losing energy. Blame it on Hollywood excess, or director Gary Fleder&#x27;s uncertain hand. A cut of 15 minutes would have helped&quot;. He was more impressed by the film&#x27;s stars, calling Morgan Freeman &quot;compelling&quot; and &quot;a hero of extraordinary power that comes almost entirely from his unemotional, calculating calm&quot;, and stating that Ashley Judd &quot;gives the sometimes plodding drama a dose of intense vitality. This young actress is getting awfully good at turning potentially gelatinous characters into substantive people who spark viewer interest&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
Judd was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture Drama at the 1998 Satellite Awards.

==Sequel and reboot==
Four years after &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot;, a film adaptation of &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; was released. Morgan Freeman reprised his role. Later, the franchise was rebooted with a 2012 adaptation of the novel &quot;Cross&quot;, titled &quot;Alex Cross&quot;, starring Tyler Perry in the title role.

<text>Stewart Duckworth Headlam (12 January 1847 – 18 November 1924) was an English Anglican priest who was involved in frequent controversy in the final decades of the nineteenth century. Headlam was a pioneer and publicist of Christian socialism, on which he wrote a pamphlet for the Fabian Society, and a supporter of Georgism. He is noted for his role as the founder and warden of the Guild of St Matthew and for helping to bail Oscar Wilde from prison at the time of his trials.

==Early years and education==

Headlam was born on 12 January 1847 in Wavertree, near Liverpool, the elder son and third of four children of Thomas Duckworth Headlam, underwriter of Liverpool. His parental home was strictly evangelical, though not narrow or severe, but Headlam rejected with horror the doctrine of eternal punishment.

From 1860-65 (ages 13–18) Headlam attended Eton College. There he was influenced by a teacher, William Johnson, who was a disciple of the Christian Socialism of F. D. Maurice and Charles Kingsley.

Headlam matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1865. There he was taught by the Professor of Moral Theology, F. D. Maurice, the primary influence in his life. Headlam came to agree with Maurice that God&#x27;s Kingdom on earth would replace a &quot;competitive, unjust society with a co-operative and egalitarian social order.&quot;

Maurice&#x27;s teaching and example shaped Headlam&#x27;s life, starting with his decision to be ordained. Years later, Headlam told colleagues in the Fabian Society: that he had been delivered from &quot;the belief that a large proportion of the human race are doomed to endless misery&quot; by Maurice&#x27;s teachings. Maurice instilled a &quot;Christian humanism&quot; in Headlam. In his Fabian Society Tract on &quot;Christian Socialism,&quot; Headlam wrote, &quot;I learnt the principles and was familiar with the title of &#x27;Christian Socialism&#x27; from Maurice and Kingsley.&quot;

==Ordination and parish ministry==
After Headlam took his degree from Cambridge in 1868, his father arranged with an Evangelical cleric, Herbert James, to give further training before ordination. But Headlam was not open to the teaching. James said, it was &quot;impossible to budge&quot; Headlam from his convictions based on Maurice&#x27;s teachings.

Headlam received another years training under Charles Vaughan who recommended him for ordination as a deacon and found him a curacy at St John&#x27;s, Drury Lane, London. Headlam was ordained deacon by Bishop John Jackson in 1869 and in 1871 as priest. His ordination as a priest was delayed by Jackson because of his reservations about Headlam&#x27;s beliefs.

Headlam had five parish assignments, but he was dismissed from all of them. He was never &quot;beneficed&quot; and after being &quot;constantly dismissed&quot; with no curacy he could hold services only when friendly clergy invited him.

===St John&#x27;s Church, Drury Lane: 1869–1873===
Hedlam&#x27;s first curacy was at St John&#x27;s Church in Drury Lane. William Graham Maul was the vicar from 1855 to 1882.

Maul and Headlam had much in common. They were both friends of the Christian socialists F. D. Maurice and Charles Kingsley who had attracted them to Christian socialism.

At St John&#x27;s, Headlam&#x27;s special ministries were &quot;church catechist&quot; and making pastoral visits.
The parishioners to whom Headlam ministered included &quot;working people, actors, actresses, and artisans&quot;. Among these people, there were &quot;music-hall dancers&quot;. These parishioners, Headlam observed, were &quot;the victims of prejudice&quot; and often &quot;cold-shouldered&quot; by other parishioners. Headlam, who was &quot;notorious for his defence of the down-trodden of every sort,&quot; set out to remedy the situation by making dancing socially acceptable.

Headlam recognized that social acceptance of dance depended on &quot;an appreciation of ballet as an autonomous aesthetic form&quot;. He adopted a threefold strategy to accomplish this goal: (1) provide an &quot;authoritative exposition of the dance technique itself&quot;, (2) form the Church and Stage Guild, and (3) formulate a theology of dance.

In spite of what they had in common, Headlam fell foul of Maul who asked him to leave the parish in 1873. It was not only, or even mainly, a matter of dogma. He outraged respectable Victorian society by his public championing of the poor and his denunciations of the uncaring rich.

===St Matthew&#x27;s, Bethnal Green: 1873–1878===
In 1873, Headlam left Drury Lane for St Matthew&#x27;s, Bethnal Green. Bethnal Green was an area of extreme poverty and Headlam was assigned to the most impoverished area.

The rector of the church, Septimus Hansard, was another Christian socialist who influenced the ideas of Headlam. Working with Hansard gave added &quot;practical content&quot; to Headlam&#x27;s &quot;socialist ideas&quot;.

The clergy usually lived outside St Matthew&#x27;s parish, but Headlam &quot;rented a flat in a working-class building.&quot; Although Headlam lived &quot;&quot;among&quot; his people, he did not live &quot;like&quot;&quot; them. His &quot;independent means&quot; enabled him to furnish his rooms in an &quot;individual style.&quot;

By 1875, &quot;men and their needs now became the centre of [Headlam&#x27;s] Christianity&quot;. Living near the church Headlam saw the &quot;degradation and suffering&quot; of the workers. Having seen this, Headlam told the St Matthew&#x27;s congregation that when people are &quot;not fed so as to grow up and healthily&quot;, it is a &quot;witness against the Church&quot; that she has &quot;neglected her primary duty&quot;.

====Poor attendance at church; good attendance at theatres; Headlam&#x27;s defence====
St. Matthew&#x27;s, Bethnal Green, was noted for poor attendance. &quot;The poor of Bethnal Green spent their Sunday mornings sleeping and the remainder of the day at the dancing room, the music hall, or the beer shop.&quot; &quot;Headlam was determined to win them back for Christ, beginning with the young people.&quot; He made Sunday School more interesting and made it coeducational.

Headlam also went to see the &quot;cheap theatres&quot; his parishioners attended rather than church services. This research was documented in a pamphlet. The problem for Headlam was that his &quot;defence of the Music Hall and the ballet as being worthy occupations and uplifting pastimes&quot; was an &quot;anathema&quot; to the puritan and political climate. In the face of opposition, Headlam gave a lecture on &quot;Theatres and Music-Halls&quot; in which he expounded a positive Christian view of theatre and the theatrical profession. The speech inflamed Headlam&#x27;s opponents and led to his bishop removing him from his curacy at St Matthew&#x27;s.

====The Guild of St Matthew====

Inspired by Maurice&#x27;s Christian socialism Headlam was determined to do all he could to reduce working class suffering. Disturbed by the appalling living conditions of his parishioners Headlam used his sermons to attack the wide gap between rich and poor. He presented Jesus Christ as a revolutionary and when John Jackson, the Bishop of London who had long been concerned about Headlam&#x27;s teaching, heard about this, he threatened Headlam with dismissal. Headlam refused to change his views.

In his efforts for the working class, in 1877, Headlam founded the Guild of St Matthew and led it to national prominence. Its original purpose was to increase attendance at early Eucharist.

Headlam challenged workers to unite to strike down &quot;the customs and circumstances&quot; that make them &quot;mere hands&quot; for the production of goods. He not only issued verbal challenges, Headlam worked with the trade union movement, especially the Women&#x27;s Trade Union League. However, Headlam had no specific proposals until he read Henry George&#x27;s &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1879). From then on George replaced Maurice as the major influence in Headlam&#x27;s thinking.

====1878: Dismissal and marriage ====

Early in 1878, Headlam was dismissed from St Matthew&#x27;s. His socialism was only one of Headlam&#x27;s conflicts with authorities. The immediate cause of his dismissal was his &quot;lecture in praise of the theatre and music halls.&quot; In June, he received a testimonial of 100 guineas raised by supporters.

Given the fact that Headlam &quot;could never keep a job&quot;, it was fortunate that his father and grandfather were underwriters in Liverpool. From them, he inherited private means on which to live when unemployed.

On 24 January 1878, Headlam married Beatrice Pennington at St. Augustine&#x27;s Church, Queensgate. The marriage was dissolved in a very short time. He discovered his wife was a lesbian.

Headlam was left with no prospect for employment, but in 1879 he was offered a curacy by John Rodgers, vicar of St Thomas&#x27;s Charterhouse.

===St Thomas&#x27;s Charterhouse: 1878–1880===
In 1878, Headlam became a curate at St Thomas&#x27;s under the vicar, the Revd John Rodgers. Rodgers was &quot;the most understanding incumbent&quot; under whom Headlam would serve and even defended him in letters to Bishop Jackson. While at St Thomas&#x27;s, Headlam continued his defence of theatre and ballet by forming the Church and Stage Guild. The death of Rodgers on 25 October 1879 ended Headlam&#x27;s curacy at St Thomas&#x27;s. Rodgers had served on the London School Board as Headlam was to do later.

===St Michael&#x27;s Shoreditch: 1880–1882===
Headlam&#x27;s curacy at St Michael&#x27;s Shoreditch was brief because the parishioners strongly opposed his positions.

From 1882 until its demise in 1903, Headlam sat on the London School Board. He took an active role in the promotion of evening classes for adults, especially as chairman of the Evening Continuation Schools Committee from 1897.

===St George&#x27;s Botolph: 1884===
A trial curacy in 1884 ended when Headlam, at a rally, called for the abolition of the House of Lords.

In 1884, Headlam used own money to buy and later to finance a newspaper, &quot;The Church Reformer: An Organ of Christian Socialism and Church Reform&quot;, that became virtually the voice of the Guild of Saint Matthew. &quot;The Church Reformer&quot; was published for eleven years. It supported land reform as advocated by Henry George.

====End of parish ministry====

After leaving St. George&#x27;s Botolph in 1884, Headlam asked Bishop Jackson for a general licence to officiate in the diocese, but Jackson refused. Jackson&#x27;s successor Frederick Temple also refused. Although his licence was eventually reinstated in 1898, he was never again to hold permanent office in the Church of England. After being &quot;constantly dismissed&quot; with no curacy, Headlam was reduced to holding services only when friendly clergy invited him.

Beginning with his ordination, Headlam&#x27;s &quot;beliefs and actions&quot; led to constant conflict with his ecclesiastical superiors and removal from curacies until he finally &quot;abandoned of the idea of a parish ministry.&quot; From then on, Headlam &quot;devoted his time propagating Socialism&quot; through his Guild of St. Matthew (until its demise in 1909) and membership in the Fabian Society and membership on the London County Council.

==Politics==

In 1873, after leaving St John&#x27;s, Headlam received a curacy from Septimus Hansard, the rector of St Matthew&#x27;s Church in Bethnal Green in London&#x27;s East End, where poverty was the intrusive fact of social life. His response, in the form of a synthesis of ideas going back a generation to the Oxford Movement with socialist thinking, was startling although not entirely original. He attributed it in part to Charles Kingsley, but more especially to F. D. Maurice, whose incarnational theology he embraced while a student at Cambridge University. He added to the ideas of these early Christian Socialists a profound commitment to the creeds and to sacramental worship which he drew from the Anglo-Catholic ritualists whose work in the London slums he deeply admired. He was also a harsh critic of evangelicalism, condemning it as individualistic and otherworldly. He befriended working-class secularists and their leader, Charles Bradlaugh, even as he fought secularism itself. He also championed the arts in a broad sense, including the theatre, at a time when many clergy regarded it as morally suspect, and more scandalous still, the music hall, and ballerinas danced in flesh-coloured tights. Politically, from the time he left Cambridge, Headlam regarded himself as a socialist of sorts. While he was in Bethnal Green his politics took a more radical turn, and in the years that followed he joined his socialism to an enthusiastic support for Henry George&#x27;s &#x27;single tax&#x27;, a policy that was gaining support in the Liberal Party. Yet because of his belief in individual liberty and his hostility to political sectarianism, he remained a member of the Liberal Party. He was elected to the London County Council as a Liberal Party–backed Progressive candidate for Bethnal Green South West latterly in opposition to Labour candidates. These ideas formed a heady mixture and his preaching of it, in a form often directed frankly against &#x27;the rich&#x27;, kept open the quarrel with Bishop Jackson and would inspire yet another with Jackson&#x27;s successor, Frederick Temple.

==Guild of St Matthew==
Headlam formed the Guild of St Matthew on 29 June 1877 (St Peter&#x27;s Day). It began as a guild within St Matthew&#x27;s Church, Bethnal Green, East London. However, in addition to parishioners, the Guild included other &quot;London curates with radical views&quot;, so it soon grew to forty members.

The Guild&#x27;s initial purpose was increasing attendance at early Eucharist. Its stated objects were: (1) better observance of the &quot;rules of worship&quot; in the Book of Common Prayer, (2) removal of prejudices against the sacraments, and (3) to promote &quot;friendly intercourse, recreation and education&quot; among its members.

When Headlam was dismissed from St Matthew&#x27;s in 1878, he took the Guild with him. No longer merely a parish guild, the Guild became organised on a national basis with local branches The Guild&#x27;s aims widened to include &quot;the promulgation of those elements in Christian social doctrine that would ameliorate the conditions of the poor through the creation of a just and equal society.&quot;

As a national organisation, the Guild linked Christian Socialists and Anglo-Catholics. This combination was incorporated in the Guild&#x27;s three objectives:
# &quot;to get rid, by every possible means, of existing prejudices, especially on the part of &#x27;secularists&#x27; against the Church, her sacraments and doctrines, and to endeavor to justify God to the people.&quot;
# &quot;to promote frequent and reverend worship in the Holy Communion, and a better observance of the teaching of the Church of England as set forth in the Book of Common Prayer.&quot;
# &quot;to promote the study of social and political questions in the light of the Incarnation.&quot;

The work of the Guild got off to a slow start as an extra-parochial society. However, by 1884 its work was in &quot;full swing&quot;. The Guild published a list of 24 lecturers willing to speak on 130 subjects. At its annual meeting, the Guild adopted resolutions endorsing socialism and Henry George&#x27;s &quot;theory of Land Nationalization&quot;. Headlam and other Guild members put their words into action by working in the English Land Reclamation League.

In 1884, Headlam used his own money to buy and edit a newspaper, &quot;The Church Reformer: An Organ of Christian Socialism and Church Reform&quot;, which became &quot;virtually (though never officially) the mouthpiece of the Guild&quot;. &quot;The Church Reformer&quot; went bankrupt and published its last issue in December 1895.

In the early 1890s, the Guild reached its peak membership of 364, of whom 99 were Anglican priests. Writing on behalf of the Guild, Headlam, in 1890, appealed that the &quot;evils of poverty&quot; be not &quot;alleviated by Christian charity, but that they may be prevented by Christian justice.&quot;

In the Guild&#x27;s doctrines, the goals of Christian justice included &quot;(a) to restore to the people the value they gave to the land&quot; where they worked, &quot;(b) to bring about a better distribution of the wealth created by labour&quot;, and (c) &quot;to give to the whole body of the people a voice in their own government&quot;, and (d) &quot;to abolish false standard of worth and dignity&quot;.

The Guild&#x27;s 1892 annual report showed that the old battle against secularism ended with the death of Charles Bradlaugh in 1891. Most of the activity of the Guild was redirected toward &quot;election campaigns&quot;.

In the 1893 annual meeting, whether to characterise the Guild as &quot;socialist&quot; was discussed with a decision in the negative. As explained by Headlam, although the Guild was composed of &quot;socialists who claim that socialism is Christian&quot;, to use the name officially would be &quot;misleading and confusing both to friend and foe&quot;.

In spite of Headlam&#x27;s resistance to the term, scholars characterise the Guild of St Matthew as &quot;socialist&quot;. Kenneth Leech says that the Guild was &quot;the first explicitly socialist group in Britain&quot; and Peter d&#x27;Alroy Jones describes the Guild as &quot;the pioneer Christian socialist society of the revival period in Britain.&quot;

Before 1895, dissatisfied members usually withdrew and joined the larger Christian Social Union. In this year, increased dissatisfaction with Headlam as warden of the Guild resulted in a &quot;large defection&quot;. In spite of dissatisfaction and defections in the membership, Headlam acted as warden of the Guild throughout its existence and his beliefs were reflected in its &quot;proceedings and policies&quot;. He did not consult with others and acted as if the Guild should act according to his ideas. Headlam&#x27;s arrogating control of the Guild constituted the primary reason for the dissatisfaction and defections.

In 1909, the Guild of St Matthew ceased to exist.

Norman describes the Guild as &quot;a clerical, sacramentalist, Anglican and Socialist organization, existing largely for propagandistic purposes. Regardless of the immediate effects of its propaganda, the Guild molded &quot;the radicalism of a number of Christian Socialists&quot; who in the following decades played roles in the Anglican church&#x27;s &quot;social discourse. These people included Conrad Noel, Percy Dearmer, J. G. Adderley, P. E. T. Widdrington, F. L. Donaldson, C. W. Stubbs,
Charles Marson, and Frank Weston.

== &#x27;Church and Stage&#x27; ==

Headlam, in his lecture entitled &quot;Theatres and Music Halls&quot; and delivered on 7 October 1877 at the Commonwealth Club, Bethnal Green, said many religious people would think him wrong to speak of theatres and music halls except in condemnation; and even more would think him wrong to do so on a Sunday night. He recalled two women, members of his congregation in Drury Lane, who kept their profession as actresses a secret for many months, fearing that he, as a clergyman, would despise them. Conversely, he declared a deep respect for all those who &quot;minister to our amusements&quot; and said their work was as sacred as any other. In the introduction to the second edition of his published lecture he said, &quot;I hold as an eternal truth that the Incarnation and Real Presence of Jesus Christ sanctifies all human things, not excluding human passion, mirth, and beauty.&quot;

He also believed good theatre could teach morality. &quot;I defy anyone to see one of Shakespeare&#x27;s great tragedies fairly well acted without having most tremendous moral lessons brought home to him,&quot; Furthermore, he believed even unsophisticated entertainment could be beneficial and that theatregoing, in moderation, had &quot;a brightening, educating effect&quot;. To &quot;gloomy religious people&quot; he said, &quot;you do much more harm by a sweeping condemnation of a place than by a discriminating judgment. Recognise the good in any place or person, and then you have a right, and a power too, to go against the evil with some chance of success&quot;.

More recently, he had come to see that even music halls had value. Managers were not to blame for the faults of their clientele, be they coarse or low, or loose women; the fault lay rather with &quot;modern civilisation&quot;. He was, however, critical of the quality of music hall songs.

John Jackson, Bishop of London, responding to a summary of the lecture in &quot;The Era&quot;, wrote to Headlam, &quot;It is, of course, vain to argue with one who prefers so unhesitatingly his own judgment backed by the approval of actors and proprietors of Music Halls to that of his Incumbent and his Bishop, neither of whom can well be considered Puritan: but I do pray earnestly that you may not have lo meet before the Judgment Seat those whom your encouragement first led to places where they lost the blush of shame and took the first downward step towards vice and misery.&quot;

At St Thomas&#x27;s on 30 May 1879, Headlam continued his defence of popular theatre, and especially the ballet, by forming the &quot;Church and Stage Guild&quot;. Within a year it had more than 470 members with at least 91 clergy and 172 professional theatre people. Its mission included breaking down &quot;the prejudice against theatres, actors, music hall artists, stage singers, and dancers.&quot;

==Fabian Society==

In December 1886, Headlam joined the Fabian Society and for several years served on the society&#x27;s executive committee. In 1888, he and Annie Besant were elected to the London School Board as members of Progressive Party, a broad coalition of London liberals, radicals and socialists. In 1902 the Conservative government abolished school boards across England and transferred their responsibilities to the county councils. Although this was a reform designed in large part by his fellow Fabian, Sidney Webb, and endorsed by the Fabian Society, Headlam, like many others on the Left, denounced it as undemocratic. The new Education Act spared the London School Board, but only temporarily. It was also abolished in 1904. Despite his expectation that he would be able run as a Progressive candidate for the London County Council that year and be given a seat on the education committee, the Progressives did not nominate him, perhaps because of pressure from Webb and his allies. It was not until 1907 that he was elected to the council where he continued to be a tireless advocate for working-class children and their teachers. In the same year he published &quot;The Socialist&#x27;s Church&quot;. He continued as a political figure for the rest of his life.

==Oscar Wilde&#x27;s bailer==
On 3 April 1895 the first trial of Oscar Wilde began. This trial ended with a jury deadlocked on most of the charges. A second trial was scheduled in three weeks. During the interim, Wilde could be released if his bail requirements were met.

Bail for the three weeks of freedom &quot;on his own recognizance&quot; between criminal trials was set at a total of £5,000. Headlam, who did not know Wilde personally, put up half the £5,000 bail required for Wilde&#x27;s release. Headlam stated his motive as &quot;concern for the arts and freedom&quot;.

At his second trial, Wilde was found guilty, and sentenced to two years of hard labor. When Wilde was released after serving his sentence, Headlam was there to meet him at six o&#x27;clock in the morning on 19 May 1897.

&#x27;Homosexuals in Headlam&#x27;s life&#x27;
Headlam did not condone homosexuality. However, his willingness to help Wilde may have been connected with the fact that &quot;others close to him had been caught in similar sexual tangles&quot;. Headlam&#x27;s own short-lived marriage in 1878 had been to a lesbian, Beatrice Pennington.

Headlam&#x27;s close relations with other homosexuals included his Eton master William Johnson and his friend C. J. Vaughan.

==Post-curacy years==
Beginning with his ordination as a deacon in 1869, Headlam was repeatedly in conflict with his ecclesiastical superiors that led to removal from curacies until he finally &quot;abandoned of the idea of a parish ministry&quot; in 1884. However, he continued to be active in social reform until shortly before his death in 1924. Central to Headlam&#x27;s activity was his work within the voluntary organisations of his Guild of St Matthew (until its demise in 1909) and the Fabian Society.

Church

Headlam addressed the 3rd Lambeth Conference in 1888 arguing that Christian socialism is biblical, but the bishops gave him &quot;little heed&quot;.

In January 1898, Headlam was granted a general licence to preach by the new Bishop of London, Mandell Creighton.
From then until his dying days, Headlam celebrated Mass every Sunday at All Souls Church in Haliburton Road.

Education

Headlam became increasingly involved with &quot;educational reform&quot;.

Education was one of the two top priorities for Headlam in post-curacy years. He had long viewed education as essential for social transformation, So in 1882, he was elected to the London School Board, an activity that he continued the rest of his life. The London School Board was absorbed into the London County Council in 1903, so Headlam ran for and was elected to the London County Council for the Progressive Party in 1907 as a way of continuing his work in educational reform. He sat on the council until his death.

Land Question
The &quot;Land Question&quot; was the other issue that occupied Headlam in his mature years. The Land Question was about &quot;the use and ownership of land&quot; and &quot;landlordism&quot; and many remedies were proposed.

Lectures offered by the Guild of St Matthew emphasised &quot;the land question as fundamental&quot; for Christian socialists. After reading Henry George&#x27;s &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (1886), Headlam asserted that &quot;Land Nationalization is a necessary corollary of Christian Socialism.&quot;

In 1906, Headlam began the Anti-Puritan League, but it gained only few members.

In 1907, Headlam published &quot;The Socialist&#x27;s Church&quot;.

Vindication

After years of conflict with and dismissals by his ecclesiastical superiors, Headlam was vindicated at the end of his life.

In October 1924, during his terminal illness, Headlam received a letter from Randall Davidson the Archbishop of Canterbury.

 My dear Headlam,

 I hear a report that you are unwell. I hope that it is not serious and work can go on, for I fear that your absence in some circles, educational and other, would be bad for &#x27;affairs&#x27; in the country. You, at least, whatever be said about the rest of us, have been consistent in your devotion to the cause or causes for which you care. God keep and bless you.

 Most truly yours, Randall Cantaur

Headlam immediately replied with a &quot;heartfelt letter of thanks&quot;. He later commented, &quot;Now I feel I can say that I have won.&quot;

Death

Within a month, more heart attacks led to Headlam&#x27;s death at his home, &quot;Wavertree&quot;, Peter&#x27;s Road, St Margaret&#x27;s-on-Thames, Middlesex, on 18 November 1924.

His funeral was held at All Souls in St Margarets and he was buried at East Sheen Cemetery on 24 November.

Retrospection 

&quot;Despite Headlam&#x27;s energy, his rebellious character and his unusual combination of socialism with Christian sacramentalism deprived him of much permanent influence either in the church or in the political world. His practical achievements were limited. He was a prophetic figure, whose passion for social justice was to inspire the small group of Anglican clergy exploring the political application of Christian social concern in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&quot;

<doc id="1164582" wikidata="Q2249236" url="?curid=1164582" title="Tom Jennings">
<text>Thomas Daniel Jennings (born 1955) is a Los Angeles-based artist and computer programmer, known for his work that led to FidoNet (the first message and file networking bulletin board system, or BBS), and for his work at Phoenix Software on MS-DOS integration and interoperability.

==Work==
In 1983, Jennings created the Fido program, which spawned FidoNet, the first message and file networking bulletin board system (BBS). The FidoNet protocols were authored by Jennings in the Fido program, and they were ultimately implemented by numerous authors in other software to create the full BBS, network using a multiplicity of platforms.

Aside from creating the protocol for networking BBSes, Jennings: built &quot;Wired&quot;″s first internet presence; wrote the portable BIOS that led to Phoenix Technologies BIOS, contributing to on MS-DOS integration and interoperability; ran an early regional internet service providerThe Little Garden (later incorporated as TLGnet, Inc); and maintains an informal archive of Cold War science and technology.

From 1988 until 1991, while he lived in San Francisco, Jennings was the publisher and co-editor, with Deke Nihilson, of &quot;Homocore&quot;, one of the earliest Queercore zines. The name came from the pages of &quot;J.D.s&quot; zine, and featured musicians and writers such as The Apostles, Steve Abbott, Donna Dresch, Larry Livermore, Daniel Nicoletta and G. B. Jones. The co-editors&#x27; other activities, such as organizing &quot;Homocore&quot; shows where bands such as Fugazi and Beat Happening appeared, and writing for and creating other publications, helped popularize the Queercore movement in the United states and internationally.

==Popular culture==
In 2002, Jennings was interviewed for the series &quot;&quot;, released online (partial content) and to home video in DVD format (full content) in 2005.

==Personal life==
In a 1996 Wired article he was described as a &quot;punk activist&quot; and &quot;anarchist&quot;.

<text>The Razor Scooter is a compact folding scooter developed by Micro Mobility Systems and manufactured by JD Corporation. Over 5 million units were sold in the six months following the launch of the first Razor scooter in 2000, and it was named as &quot;Spring/Summer Toy of the Year&quot; that same year. The first electric Razor scooter was released in 2003. Today, the Razor is manufactured by RazorUSA, based in Cerritos, California, in the United States.

==Design==
The basic scooter design consists of an airplane grade aluminum frame, 98 mm polyurethane wheels, and a hinged fender over the rear wheel, which is pushed down by the foot to act as a spoon brake. The handlebar and headtube fold for carriage when a quick release latch is opened.

== Electric scooters ==

In 2003, RazorUSA introduced its first electric Razor scooter. It operates with the use of a twisting throttle. These new models reach speeds up to 15 miles per hour. Electric scooters became a popular way to travel slightly longer distances than one might with a traditional Razor scooter, yet distances short enough that using a bike would be excessive.

==Freestyle riding==
Freestyle scootering is a growing sport. Due to the rough demands of trick riding, people often reinforce the scooter to withstand impacts and high force.

== Safety ==
Razor scooters have received attention for the frequency of injuries sustained by riders. In 2014, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and other news outlets reported that Razor and other brands of scooters contributed to substantial increases in yearly numbers of emergency room visits.

Razor claims their scooters are safe to ride, and recommends adult supervision and the use of protective gear when riding. To increase the safety of younger riders, razor recommends a three wheeled scooter.

== Team Razor ==
Team Razor is an exhibition scooter team sponsored by Razor. This team of professionals travels across the U.S., wowing crowds with their tricks and talents, and appeared at X Games Los Angeles 2013. In October 2013 they completed the Team Razor Cross Country Tour, visiting 17 states as well as the District of Columbia. The team held their most recent exhibition event on August 30, 2014 at the 3rd Annual Triple Crown.

<text>USS &quot;Cusk&quot; (SS/SSG/AGSS-348) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy named for the cusk, a large food fish related to the cod.

==History==
&quot;Cusk&quot; was launched 28 July 1945 by Electric Boat, Groton, Conn.; cosponsored by Mrs. C. S. Gillette, and Mrs. W. G. Reed; and commissioned 5 February 1946.

Departing New London 24 April 1946, &quot;Cusk&quot; made an extended cruise through the Caribbean Sea, and arrived at San Diego 6 June 1946. She sailed to Alaska and northern waters between 16 July and 20 August, then carried out local operations out of San Diego. A pioneer in the missile field, &quot;Cusk&quot; was fitted with a missile hangar and launching ramp just aft of her sail in 1947. 
She was designated SSG-348, 20 January 1948 and was the first submarine to launch a guided missile (a Republic-Ford JB-2 Loon, derived from the German V-1 flying bomb) from her own deck, a forerunner of the cruise missile and ballistic missile submarines of the future.

She entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard for a &quot;Fleet Snorkel&quot; conversion and modernization in 1954, but remained in the Regulus missile program because of her special guidance equipment, although redesignated SS-348 on 1 July 1954.

&quot;Cusk&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor, her new home port, 13 May 1957. Continuing her missile guidance duties with consorts , and she operated in Hawaiian waters with a cruise to San Diego in 1957 and duty in the Far East in 1958 and 1960.

In the fall of 1961 &quot;Cusk&quot; had her Regulus missile guidance equipment removed and reverted to attack submarine profile. After successfully shooting a MK 14 Mod 3 warshot torpedo at the target cliffs on Kahoolawe Island she departed for WesPac in January 1962. Designated as the SubFlot 7 Mining platform during the deployment, &quot;Cusk&quot; offloaded all steam torpedoes at Cubi Point NAS that spring and reloaded 4 MK 27 Mobile drill mines and 18 MK 10 moored drill mines. 12 days after departure from Subic Bay, &quot;Cusk&quot; entered the shallow waters of Buckner Bay Okinawa submerged, launched the 4 MK 27 mobile mines and then planted a field of 18 MK 10 moored mines. following the successful mine plant &quot;Cusk&quot; returned to Subic Bay RP, and retrieved her MK 14 Mod 3 warshot torpedoes.

In June 1969, the Secretary of Defense ordered that 100 of the Navy&#x27;s oldest ships be decommissioned; the &quot;Cusk&quot; was on that list. Subsequently, the &quot;Cusk&quot; was redesignated AGSS-348 and she set sail for the last time in September 1969 for Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco. 
&quot;Cusk&quot; was decommissioned and simultaneously struck from the Naval Register, 24 September 1969; she was sold for scrap, 26 June 1972.

<doc id="1164602" wikidata="Q1043631" url="?curid=1164602" title="Murtala Muhammed International Airport">
<text>Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) () is an international airport located in Ikeja, Lagos State, Nigeria, and is the major airport serving the entire state. The airport was initially built during World War II and is named after Murtala Muhammed (1938–1976), the fourth military ruler of Nigeria.

==History==

The airport was built during World War II. West African Airways Corporation (WAAC) was formed in 1947 and had its main base at Ikeja. De Havilland Doves were initially operated on WAACs Nigerian internal routes then West African services. Larger Douglas Dakotas were added to the Ikeja-based fleet from 1957.

Originally known as Lagos Airport, it was renamed after the military head of state Murtala Muhammed in 1976 following his assassination in a failed coup attempt. A new international terminal modeled after Amsterdam Airport Schiphol was constructed through the decade at a cost of ₦240 million, officially opening on 15 March 1979, as part of a broader master plan to ensure sufficient capacity through the year 2000. It is the main base for Nigeria&#x27;s largest airline, Air Peace, as well as for several other Nigerian airlines.


Murtala Muhammed International Airport consists of an international and a domestic terminal, located about one kilometre from each other. Both terminals share the same runways. This domestic terminal used to be the old Ikeja Airport. International operations moved to the new international airport when it was ready while domestic operations moved to the Ikeja Airport, which became the domestic airport. The domestic operations were relocated to the old Lagos domestic terminal in 2000 after a fire. A new domestic privately funded terminal known as MMA2 has been constructed and was commissioned on 7 April 2007.

During the late 1980s and 1990s, the international terminal had a reputation for being dangerous. From 1992 through 2000, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) posted warning signs in all US international airports advising travellers that security conditions at Lagos Airport did not meet ICAO minimum standards. In 1993, the FAA suspended air service between Lagos and the United States. The decision affected Nigeria Airways and American Trans Air. 

Following Olusegun Obasanjo&#x27;s democratic election in 1999, the security situation at Lagos began to improve. Airport police instituted a &quot;shoot on sight&quot; policy for anyone found in the secure areas around runways and taxiways, stopping further airplane robberies. Police secured the inside of the terminal and the arrival areas outside. The FAA ended its suspension of direct flights to Nigeria in 2001 in recognition of these security improvements. Through its joint venture with Nigeria Airways, South African Airways (SAA) inaugurated a flight from Johannesburg to New York via Lagos in February 2001. The airline reserved roughly a third of the seats on the Boeing 747 for Nigeria Airways. SAA terminated the service the following March, stating that it was unprofitable. The company added that in an attempt to increase passenger counts, they had tried to convince Nigeria Airways to accept a smaller seat allotment, but the latter refused. One month later, Nigeria Airways began their own route to New York with a leased Boeing 747. The airline had to suspend the flight in January 2003 because creditors had seized one of their last planes. In July 2006, North American Airlines launched nonstop service to New York using Boeing 767s.

By 2010, the FAA had granted the airport its highest safety rating. That year, the airport served 6,273,545 passengers.

Recent years have seen substantial improvements at Murtala Muhammed International Airport. Malfunctioning and non-operational infrastructures such as air conditioning and luggage belts have been repaired. The entire airport has been cleaned, and many new restaurants and duty-free stores have opened. Bilateral Air Services Agreements signed between Nigeria and other countries are being revived and new ones signed. These agreements have seen the likes of Emirates, Ocean Air, Delta and China Southern Airlines express interest and receive landing rights to Nigeria&#x27;s largest international airport.

On 6 September 2012, then Minister of Aviation, Stella Oduah, announced that the Federal Government of Nigeria approved a N106 billion loan from the Exim Bank of China to construct 5 new international terminals, including a passenger terminal in Murtala Muhammed International Airport. Construction began in late 2013, and the new international terminal was commissioned by President Muhammadu Buhari on 22 March 2022. The new terminal has the capacity to process 14 million passengers annually. Initially, most airlines did not move their flights to the new terminal as the apron did not have enough space for larger planes to taxi to the gate with the terminal&#x27;s layout. In response, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria announced that it would demolish two private hangars to increase the apron space and successfully ordered all airlines to shift to the new terminal by October 2023, stating that the move was necessary to renovate the old terminal.

<text>Todd Dunivant (born December 26, 1980) is an American former soccer player who played 13 years in Major League Soccer winning 5 MLS Cup trophies. After retirement he spearheaded the San Francisco Deltas professional soccer team as the Director of Soccer Operations and Business Development —winning the NASL Championship in its expansion season. He currently serves as the general manager of Sacramento Republic FC.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
In high school, Dunivant won two Colorado state championships in 1997 and 1998 at Dakota Ridge High School. Dunivant was also an exemplary 
student, being Valedictorian for his class of 1999.
Dunivant played college soccer at Stanford University from 1999 to 2002. Dunivant appeared in 81 Games at Stanford and was the only player in the nation to be both First Team All-American and First Team Academic All-American in 2002. He led the Cardinal to back to back Final Fours in 2001 and 2002. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 3.33 years.

=== Playing career ===
Dunivant was the first college senior taken in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft and was selected sixth overall by the San Jose Earthquakes. Dunivant started all thirty of the team&#x27;s games that year, while scoring one goal and six assists, as the Quakes won its second MLS Cup. He was traded to Los Angeles Galaxy in 2005 in a four-player deal and played every minute for the Galaxy, as they won the MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup double.[1] Dunivant was eventually traded to the New York Red Bulls, where he made twenty-two appearances during the 2006–07 seasons.

Dunivant was acquired by expansion side Toronto FC on June 27, 2007, in a trade for Kevin Goldthwaite. Dunivant played 18 games for Toronto in his first season, all of them starts. Dunivant was traded back to the Los Angeles Galaxy on February 3, 2009, in exchange for allocation money. He spent seven more seasons with the Galaxy, collecting 3 more MLS Cups (2011, 2012, 2014), 2 supporter shields (2010, 2011).

Dunivant retired from soccer at the end of the 2015 MLS season with 25 MLS Playoff appearances, 5 MLS Cup Championships (second most all-time), a 2011 Best XI Selection and a 4x Humanitarian of the Year Recipient.[2] Those accomplishments suggest that Dunivant &quot;was arguably the best left fullback in the league during his career - certainly one of the most consistent players in MLS.&quot;

Dunivant got his first cap for the United States national team on January 29, 2006, against Norway where he recorded 2 assists. He then started in a 3–2 victory over Japan on February 11, 2006.

<doc id="1164606" wikidata="Q429571" url="?curid=1164606" title="Brilliant (diamond cut)">
<text>A brilliant is a diamond or other gemstone cut in a particular form with 57-58 facets so as to have exceptional brilliance. The word &#x27;brilliant&#x27; is also used for a diamond cut in this fashion. The underside is conical, a shape that provides maximal light return through the top of the diamond.
Even with modern techniques, the cutting and polishing of a diamond crystal always results in a dramatic loss of weight; rarely is this loss less than 50%. The round brilliant cut is preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly-shaped crystals such as macles are more likely to be cut in a &quot;fancy cut&quot;—that is, a cut other than the round brilliant—which the particular crystal shape lends itself to.

== Origin and etymology ==

The earliest diamond cutting techniques were simply to polish the natural shape of rough diamonds, often octahedral crystals. Around the 1500s, polishing and cutting inventions made it possible to shape diamonds better, cut facets and make the stones sparkle more. By 1750, a round cut called Old European cut had developed. It was improved into the Circular (or Transitional) brilliant around 1880, to be finalized as the modern round brilliant cut in 1950.

As brilliant cut diamonds became more popular, the term &#x27;brilliant&#x27; transitioned from being just the name of a style to cut a gemstone, to be used as a common name or abbreviation for &#x27;round brilliant cut diamonds&#x27;. Today, the words brilliant and diamond are often interchangeable in everyday language.

== Facet proportions and names ==

The modern round brilliant-cut was developed by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919. The ideal proportions are 100% diameter, 53% table, 43.1% pavilion and 16.2% crown. The girdle and culet (if anynot part of Tolkowsky&#x27;s original design) are cut from the ideal brilliant. The modern round brilliant consists of 58 facets (or 57 if the culet is excluded), ordinarily today cut in two pyramids placed base to base: 33 on the &quot;crown&quot; (the top half above the middle or &quot;girdle&quot; of the stone), truncated comparatively near its base by the table, and 25 on the &quot;pavilion&quot; (the lower half below the girdle), which has only the apex cut off to form the culet, around which 8 extra facets are sometimes added. Over time it has become usual for most girdles to be faceted. Many girdles have 32, 64, 80, or 96 facets; these facets are not counted in the total. While the facet count is standard, the actual proportions (crown height and angle, pavilion depth, etc.) are not standardised. Some gem cutters refer to an American brilliant cut or a Scandinavian brilliant cut. According to Green et al. 2001:
Figures 1 and 2 show the facets of a round brilliant diamond.

Figure 1 assumes that the &quot;thick part of the girdle&quot; is the same thickness at all 16 &quot;thick parts&quot;. It does not consider the effects of indexed upper girdle facets.

Figure 2 is adapted from Figure 37 of Marcel Tolkowsky&#x27;s &quot;Diamond Design&quot;, which was originally published in 1919. Since 1919, the lower girdle facets have become longer. As a result, the pavilion main facets have become narrower.

== Cut grading ==

The relationship between the crown angle and the pavilion angle has the greatest effect on the look of the diamond. A slightly steep pavilion angle can sometimes be complemented by a shallower crown angle and &quot;vice versa&quot;.

Other proportions also affect the look of the diamond:
* The table ratio is highly significant.
* The length of the lower girdle facets affects whether Hearts and arrows can be seen in the stone, under certain viewers.
** Most round brilliant diamonds have roughly the same girdle thickness at all 16 &quot;thick parts&quot;.
** So-called &quot;cheated&quot; girdles have thicker girdles where the main facets touch the girdle than where adjacent upper girdle facets touch the girdle. These stones weigh more for a given diameter, average girdle thickness, crown angle, pavilion angle, and table ratio, and have worse optical performance, i.e., their upper girdle facets appear dark in some lighting conditions.
** So-called &quot;painted&quot; girdles have thinner girdles where the main facets touch the girdle than where adjacent upper girdle facets touch the it. These stones (such as EightStar-brand diamonds) have less light leakage at the edge of the stone (for a given crown angle, pavilion angle, and table ratio). Some diamonds with painted girdles receive lower grades in the GIA&#x27;s cut grading system, for reasons given in a 2005 GIA article.

Several groups have developed diamond cut grading standards. These standards differ somewhat on which proportions make the best cut. There are certain proportions that are considered best by two or more groups, however.
* The AGA standards may be the strictest. David Atlas, who developed the AGA standards, has suggested that they are overly strict.
* The HCA (Holloway Cut Adviser) changed several times between 2001 and 2004. , an HCA score below two represented an excellent cut. The HCA distinguishes between brilliant, Tolkowsky, and fiery cuts.
* The American Gem Society (AGS) standards changed in 2005 in order better to match Tolkowsky&#x27;s model and Octonus&#x27; ray tracing results. The 2005 AGS standards penalize stones with &quot;cheated&quot; girdles. They grade from 0 to 10.
*The GIA began grading cut on every grading report beginning in 2006, based on their comprehensive study of 20,000 proportions with 70,000 observations of 2,000 diamonds. The single descriptive words are as follows: Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor.
The distance from the viewer&#x27;s eye to the diamond is important.
The 2005 AGS cut standards are based on a distance of 25 centimeters (about 10 inches).
The 2004 HCA cut standards are based on a distance of 40 centimeters (about 16 inches).

Polish and symmetry are two important aspects of cut. The polish grade describes the smoothness of the diamond&#x27;s facets and the symmetry grade refers to alignment of the facets. With poor polish, the surface of a facet can be dull and may create blurred or dull sparkle. The stone may look like it needs to be cleaned. Because of the lack of symmetry, light can be misdirected as it enters and exits the diamond.

== Hearts and arrows phenomenon ==

A diamond that has the top facet or &quot;table facet&quot; exactly perpendicular to the bottom of the diamond or &quot;pavilion&quot; and has its other facets precisely aligned with excellent symmetry, may show patterns that look like arrows from the top and hearts from the bottom. Generally it will need to be viewed loose under a gemscope to see the pattern very well. Although the hearts and arrows property is indicative of a top-tier cut, it does not always mean the diamond will be the most brilliant. Optimal facet placement is the key to brilliance and more important than facet patterning. Not all ideal round cuts will have the hearts and arrows effect either.

<text>Marrickville is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Marrickville is located south-west of the Sydney central business district and is the largest suburb in the Inner West Council local government area.

Marrickville sits on the northern bank of the Cooks River, opposite Earlwood and shares borders with Stanmore, Enmore, Newtown, St Peters, Sydenham, Tempe, Dulwich Hill, Hurlstone Park and Petersham. The southern part of the suburb, near the river, is known as Marrickville South and includes the historical locality called &quot;The Warren&quot;.

Marrickville is a culturally diverse suburb consisting of both low and high density residential, commercial and light industrial areas.

==History==

=== Gadigal history ===
The Gadigal or Cadigal people of the Eora Nation have lived in the Marrickville area for tens of thousands of years. Their connection continues today. The area along the Cooks River was an important area for fishing. Pemulwuy, the Aboriginal resistance leader, was based around the river and led many attacks against settlers in the 1790s until his murder by colonists in 1802. In the 1830s, Aboriginal people were seen fishing in on the river on what is now the Marrickville Golf Course. From the time the Aboriginal Protection Board in 1883, until post World War II, there are few records available of Gadigal people along the river, but post-war saw the migration of many Aboriginal people back to Marrickville. &quot;&quot;Many live close to the Cooks River and have developed a strong custodial sense for the river, its history and its heritage&quot;&quot;&quot;.&quot; According to the 2016 Census there are 415 Aboriginal people living in Marrickville.

=== History after European settlement ===
The name Marrickville comes from the 24.3 ha (60 acres) &#x27;Marrick&#x27; estate of Thomas Chalder, which was subdivided on 24 February 1855. He named it after his native village Marrick, North Yorkshire, England. The estate centred on the intersection of Victoria Road and Chapel Street. William Dean, the publican of the Marrick Hotel, in Illawarra Road (now the site of the Henson Park Hotel) is credited with adding the &quot;ville&quot; to Marrick when it was gazetted in 1861.

The first land grant in the area was to William Beckwith in 1794. Thomas Moore received in 1799 and another in 1803. Robert Wardell purchased most of this land for his estate that stretched from Petersham to the Cooks River. His estate was broken up after he was murdered by escaped convicts in September 1834.

Thomas Holt (1811–1888) was a Sydney business tycoon who built a castellated Victorian Gothic mansion named &quot;The Warren&quot; in 1857 in Marrickville South. It was designed by architect George Mansfield, and contained an impressive art gallery filled with paintings and sculptures from Europe. It had elaborate stables built into imposing stone walls, and large landscaped gardens filled with urns overlooking the Cooks River. Holt gave it that name because he bred rabbits on the estate for hunting, as well as the grounds being stocked with alpacas and other exotics. The Warren was a landmark in the district for some decades; the still-operating Warren View Hotel in Enmore as evidence of this.

Renovations were undertaken in 1866. There were also bathing sheds and a Turkish Bath built on the river. The property was south of Wardell&#x27;s and covered the area from today&#x27;s Unwins Bridge Road to Illawarra Road and Warren Road. Thomas Holt was a large land holder in Sydney with another mansion at the edge of Gwawley Bay, Sylvania Waters, New South Wales in 1881,(his last and greatest residence, the monumental forty room Sutherland House mansion which was destroyed by fire in 1918) and vast property holdings from Sutherland to Cronulla.

As Holt&#x27;s health began to be an issue, the Warren was subdivided in 1884 with the land around the immediate building&#x27;s grounds being sold off - and the family returning to Britain for the remaining years of his life. He died in 1888.
The estate stables were demolished some time between 1884 and 1886, with the nearby Ferncourt Public School being originally built as a house &quot;Prosna&quot; by Polish born artist, Gracius Joseph Broinowski, from sandstone blocks of the stable, and a cedar staircase and marble mantelpiece purchased from Holt&#x27;s estate installed in it.

It is obvious today the last block remaining where the mansion stood as it is indicated by the newer houses of the 1920s-1930s as well as, obviously the name of the road, driven down the western side of the block - &quot;Mansion Street&quot; - and &quot;Holt St&quot; adjacent to it forming the lower side of the square perimeter).

The Warren became a nunnery when the mansion and of land were purchased by a French order of Carmelite nuns. The Carmelites were evicted from The Warren in 1903 for outstanding debts. By this stage the grounds appear to be bare with a high wood fence installed on the western side of the building about this time. It then was used during WWI for an artillery training range and this fenced area also appears in photos along with smaller buildings on the grounds nearby. It was resumed in 1919 by the New South Wales government was finally demolished in around 1922 - the land subdivided to build a housing estate for returned soldiers. Sir John Sulman was engaged to build this.

Not much remains of the once imposing castle-like building except for two stone turrets from the building indicating what was once on the general spot (this was recently vandalised and the commemorative plaque stolen; noted 2010. Originally piers from the back entrance of the building, which had been stored by the council for many years - they were placed on the headland with a memorial fountain in 1967 at Richardson&#x27;s Lookout in Holt Street. Other remains are garden paths with flags and liners, one or two of the original stone blocks from the walls, and the base of what was probably a garden feature such as an urn or fountain. An area with a few cobblestones in the grass, remains under some native fig trees, and was probably a drive that led to the back of the stables. Also on the bank of the river below are the crypts that Thomas Holt built into a sandstone overhang for his family. No bodies were subsequently laid to rest except for the Mother Superior of the Carmelite order who was interred for a short time.

Marrickville became a municipality on 6 November 1861. In 1948, it merged with neighbouring municipalities of St Peters and Petersham to form Marrickville Municipal Council.

The first school opened in August 1864 and the post office opened in 1865. The railway line to Bankstown opened in 1895. The station was known as Illawarra Road during construction. Later, when it was decided that Marrickville was a more appropriate name, the original Marrickville station was renamed Sydenham.

In the first half of the 20th century, Marrickville was a centre of Catholic-dominated Labor politics and the political base of Joseph Cahill, who continued to live there throughout his term as Premier of New South Wales.

Marrickville saw notable demographic changes due to post-World War II immigration. Many new immigrants, particularly from Southern Europe, settled in the area, creating its multiculturally diverse character. This influx of migrants shaped Marrickville&#x27;s local culture, economy and infrastructure. The suburb developed a strong Italian and Greek community and many immigrants found work in nearby factories, retails and trading. Artists, young professionals and people in distance to the city centre moved into the area. An affluence of cafés, boutique shops and street art changed the character of its neighborhood.

===Mid–2000s: gentrification===
There has been a gradual change in Marrickville, with some media reports calling it &quot;the new Paddington&quot;. There has been an influx of young professionals, as well as artists and musicians. A bohemian vibe has been cultivated and some say Marrickville is &quot;the new Newtown&quot;, not Paddington . Marrickville has been referred to as the number one emerging &quot;Sydney hipster suburbs of 2017&quot;, due to its youthful population and was voted 10th Coolest Neighbourhood in the World by Timeout in 2020 with its increasing numbers of liquor licences, breweries and numerous &quot;foodie&quot; eateries. In 2022, it again made Time Out’s list, ranked at second coolest neighbourhood in Australia and thirty-third coolest in the world.

<text>A Swiss arrow (also known as a Yorkshire arrow, Dutch arrow, Scotch arrow, or Gypsy arrow) is a type of enlarged dart in the shape of an arrow that is thrown with the aid of a lanyard, which is retained by a small notch close to the fletching. It is very similar to an amentum and uses the same throwing principle as a spear-thrower.

==Design==
The arrow shaft is made from wood. A slit is cut at one end to take a pair of card flights, and the other end is given a point. An all-important notch or shallow groove is cut into or around the shaft, just below the flights. After the flights are inserted, the open end of the slit is closed with string or a rubber band to prevent the flights from falling out.

==Use==
To launch the arrow, the thrower uses a length of string that is longer than the length of the arrow itself. A knot is tied in one end of the string, and this is placed into the notch or groove in the arrow shaft. The rest of the string is then passed around the shaft once, and is made to align over and above the knot before being stretched down to the point end of the arrow. The string is tightened, ensuring that the knotted end stays within the notch, and the surplus is wound around the thrower&#x27;s throwing hand. The throwing hand with the string wound around it should be near the point end of the arrow, with the thrower able to easily grip the end.

The arrow is then held behind the thrower, with the string taut. The throwing arm should be as fully extended as possible, enabling the arrow to be thrown like a javelin, but held much closer to the tip. Following through with the throwing hand allows the string to provide additional forward force on the arrow, extending the length and reach of the thrower&#x27;s arm, in a fashion similar to a sling. A distance of about can easily be achieved.

<text>Eric Timothy Lewis (born May 29, 1982, in Houston, Texas) is an American soccer defender.

==Career==
Lewis played college soccer at Clemson University for three years from 2000 to 2002. A starter for all three years, Lewis finished his career at the school with ten goals and 12 assists in 61 games.

After his junior season, Lewis signed a Project-40 contract with MLS, and was selected 20th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the Los Angeles Galaxy. As a rookie with the Galaxy, Lewis played in 13 games for the team, a starter in seven of those. In the 2004 season, he was traded mid-season to the Colorado Rapids in exchange for a late-round draft pick. Lewis started for Colorado in 16 games in 2005. He was waived at the end of 2005. After leaving Colorado, he was invited to train with Standard Liege in Belgium for two weeks in the fall of 2005, but failed to land another regular roster spot. While showing promise coming out of college, Lewis hung up his cleats for good by 2006.

Lewis had five years of youth national team experience. He was the starting left back of the US Under-20 team which competed in the 2001 FIFA World Youth Championship. He was also a member of the US Under-23 team which competed for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. During the final qualifying tournament, he played in 6 games, starting in the final three.

==Personal life==
Lewis is married to Leslie Osborne, with whom he has three daughters.

<doc id="1164620" wikidata="Q4797605" url="?curid=1164620" title="Arthello Beck">
<text>Arthello Beck Jr. (July 17, 1941 – November 5, 2004) was an American artist. He often painted scenes of places he had visited, using a variety of mediums, including oils, watercolors, and charcoal.

Beck was born in Dallas, Texas, and attended Lincoln High School, where he received his only formal art training. Afterwards, he worked for the United States Postal Service, as well as various other jobs before becoming a professional artist.

He is possibly known best for his works from the 1960s dealing with the Civil Rights Movement, although Beck commonly featured other subjects, including children, religion, and human interaction, particularly in the African-American community in the southern regions of the United States.

A longtime resident of Oak Cliff, Beck was a firm believer in grassroots movements, and established the Arthello Beck Gallery, which became a centerpiece of the Dallas area art scene in the 1970s and 80s, and was instrumental to the careers of many black artists.

Beck was a member of the National Conference of Artists and the Southwest Alliance of African American Artists, and was one of the founders of the Southwest Black Artists Guild.

==Honors==
His paintings and sketches were among those selected for inclusion in a touring exhibition of athlete Grant Hill&#x27;s collection of African-American artists. Hill, who began collecting art in emulation of his father, Calvin Hill, particularly cited Beck&#x27;s painting &quot;Confrontation&quot; (1969) as an influence, saying, &quot;I grew up with this painting, and just as my father is attached to it because it reflects the historic struggle of the black male, so am I.&quot;

In 2007, a local campaign was organized to rename the South Dallas Cultural Center in Beck&#x27;s honor. Although a petition was signed by over 850 residents, the City Council voted unanimously to reject the proposal, choosing instead to give his name to a gallery within the center. The decision met with controversy on both sides, as proponents felt that a gallery within the building was not a sufficiently prominent honor, while others argued that the center&#x27;s current name brings honor to a section of town that is often maligned and that a majority of the petition&#x27;s signers lived outside the South Dallas area.

<text>Michael John Smith (4 January 1942 – 12 November 2004) was an English cricketer, who played most of his cricket as an opening batsman for Middlesex County Cricket Club. Together with Mike Brearley he formed a successful opening partnership. He also played five One Day Internationals for England in 1973 and 1974.

In first-class cricket Smith made 19,814 runs at an average of 31.65 in a career that lasted from 1959 to 1980, a total that included 40 centuries. His highest score was 181 against Lancashire County Cricket Club at Old Trafford in 1967. Although he batted right-handed he took 57 wickets, with a bowling average of 32.73, with slow left-arm deliveries. He also took 218 catches in the field. In 1994 he became the official scorer for Middlesex. In total Smith spent 22 seasons on the staff at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

He was educated at Enfield Grammar School. Smith was twice married and had three daughters, Debbie, Libby, Emma, and a son, Jonathan.

==Quotations==
Mike Brearley, Smith&#x27;s fellow opening batsman at Middlesex, in his book &quot;The Art of Captaincy&quot; wrote about how Smith prepared for his innings: &quot;Mike Smith would be having his last-minute &#x27;net&#x27; in front of the dressing-room mirror. He clicks his tongue on the roof of his mouth to represent ball on bat as he plays an immaculate forward defensive shot.&quot; He also recalled Smith&#x27;s approach to batting: &quot;You can never trust bowlers: they develop something new each year.&quot;

<text>Dame Rose Tremain (born 2 August 1943) is an English novelist, short story writer, and former Chancellor of the University of East Anglia.

==Life==
Rose Tremain was born Rosemary Jane Thomson on 2 August 1943 in London to Viola Mabel Thomson and Keith Nicholas Home Thomson. Her paternal great-grandfather is William Thomson, who was Archbishop of York from 1862 to 1890.

She was educated at Francis Holland School, Crofton Grange School, the Sorbonne (1961–1962) and the University of East Anglia (BA, English Literature). She later went on to teach creative writing at the University of East Anglia from 1988 to 1995, and was appointed Chancellor in 2013.

She married Jon Tremain in 1971 and they had one daughter, Eleanor, born in 1972, who became an actress. The marriage lasted about five years. Her second marriage, to theatre director Jonathan Dudley, in 1982, lasted about nine years; and she has been with Richard Holmes since 1992. She lives in Thorpe St Andrew near Norwich in Norfolk.

==Writing==
Her influences include William Golding, author of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, and Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;100 Years of Solitude&quot; and the magical realism style.

She is a historical novelist who approaches her subjects &quot;from unexpected angles, concentrating her attention on unglamorous outsiders&quot;.

In 2009, she donated the short story &quot;The Jester of Astapovo&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s &quot;Ox-Tales&quot; project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Her story was published in the &quot;Earth&quot; collection.

She became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1983. Already Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), Tremain was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to writing.

<text>Iron Jawed Angels is a 2004 American historical drama film directed by Katja von Garnier. The film stars Hilary Swank as suffragist leader Alice Paul, Frances O&#x27;Connor as activist Lucy Burns, Julia Ormond as Inez Milholland, and Anjelica Huston as Carrie Chapman Catt. It received critical acclaim after the film premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.

The film focuses on the American women&#x27;s suffrage movement during the 1910s and follows women&#x27;s suffrage leaders Alice Paul and Lucy Burns as they use peaceful and effective nonviolent strategies, tactics, and dialogues to revolutionize the American feminist movement to grant women the right to vote. The film was released in the United States on February 15, 2004.

==Plot==
Alice Paul and Lucy Burns return from England where they met while participating in the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union started by radical suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst and led by her daughter Christabel Pankhurst. The pair presents a plan to the National American Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Association (NAWSA) to campaign directly in Washington D.C. for national voting rights for women. They find that their ideas are too forceful for the established suffragist leaders in the U.S., particularly Carrie Chapman Catt, but they are allowed to lead the NAWSA Congressional Committee in D.C. They start by organizing the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession on the eve of President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s inauguration.

While soliciting donations at an art gallery, Paul convinces labor lawyer Inez Milholland to lead the parade on a white horse. Paul also meets a Washington newspaper political cartoonist, Ben Weissman (a fictional character), and there are hints of romantic overtones. In a fictional scene, Paul tries to explain to Ida B. Wells why she wants African American women to march in the back of the parade in order to not anger southern Democrats and activists, but Wells refuses, and she comes out of the crowd to join a white group during the middle of the parade. After disagreements over fundraising, Paul and Burns are forced out of the NAWSA, and they found the National Woman&#x27;s Party (NWP) to support their approach. Alice Paul briefly explores a romantic relationship with Ben Weissman.

Further conflicts within the movement are portrayed as NAWSA leaders criticize NWP tactics, such as protesting against Wilson, and their sustained picketing outside of the White House in the Silent Sentinels action. Relations between the American government and the NWP protesters also intensify, as many women are arrested for their actions and charged with &quot;obstructing traffic.&quot;

The arrested women are sent to the Occoquan Workhouse for 60-day terms. Despite abusive and terrorizing treatment, Paul and other women undertake a hunger strike, during which paid guards force-feed them milk and raw eggs. The suffragists are blocked from seeing visitors or lawyers, until (fictional) U.S. Senator Tom Leighton visits his wife Emily, one of the imprisoned women. News of their treatment leaks to the media after Emily secretly passes a letter to her husband during his visit. Paul, Burns, and the other women are released.

Pressure continues to be put on President Wilson as the NAWSA joins in the NWP call for passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Wilson finally accedes to the pressure rather than be called out in the international press for fighting for democracy in Europe while denying democracy&#x27;s benefits to half of the U.S. population. During the amendment&#x27;s ratification, Harry T. Burn, a member of the Tennessee legislature, receives a telegram from his mother at the last minute, changes his vote, and the amendment passes.

==Origin of title==
The film derives its title from Massachusetts Representative Joseph Walsh, who in 1917 opposed the creation of a committee to deal with women&#x27;s suffrage. Walsh thought the creation of a committee would be yielding to &quot;the nagging of iron-jawed angels&quot; and referred to the Silent Sentinels as &quot;bewildered, deluded creatures with short skirts and short hair.&quot; The use of iron holding open the jaws of the women being force-fed after the Silent Sentinel arrests and hunger strike is also a plot point in the film.

==Cast==
===Fictional characters===
The fictional characters in the film are Ben Weissman; his child; Emily Leighton; and Senator Tom Leighton.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;&quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot; is an important history lesson told in a fresh, and blazing fashion.&quot; Scott Faundas of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a negative review, writing, &quot;HBO&#x27;s starry suffragette drama, &quot;Iron Jawed Angels&quot;, latches on to a worthy historical subject and then hopes noble intentions will be enough to carry the day. Alas, there&#x27;s no such luck in this talky, melodramatic overview of the dawn of equal rights for women in America. Gussied up with a comically anachronistic use of period music on the soundtrack and flashy, MTV-style montage sequences, pic misguidedly strives – but ultimately fails – to belie its instincts as an assembly-line movie-of-the-week.&quot;

Robert Pardi of &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave a mixed review, &quot;All the elements for a splendid film about the early days of the women&#x27;s rights are in place, but director Katja von Garnier&#x27;s use of distracting cinematic trickery and jarringly modern music meshes poorly with the period setting... Blessed with a flawless physical production, von Garnier distorts her epic tale with music that belongs on a Lilith Fair tour; it sometimes feels as though she and her writers conceived the fight for women&#x27;s suffrage as a 1912 version of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Only when the anachronisms finally subside in the film&#x27;s final third is the moving core allowed to shine.&quot;

Historians have been critical about the movie for several reasons. Director Katja von Garnier created a 21st-century soundtrack and remade the early 20th-century suffragists into &quot;third-wave&quot; feminists that would be more familiar to modern audiences. The depiction of Alice Paul&#x27;s sexuality in the film had no basis in historic fact; Paul was single-minded in her devotion to winning suffrage for women. There is no evidence she had a sexually intimate relationship with anyone, male or female. The movie even creates a fictional character to play a love interest for Paul, cartoonist Ben Weissman. This suggests that Paul needed the assistance of a newspaperman to get publicity for her activist campaign, when in reality, Paul was a highly talented publicist in her own right.

The film also portrayed Paul welcoming Ida B. Wells-Barnett with a smile when Wells-Barnett joined the procession from the mass of spectators along the route. This never happened in reality, and was perhaps the director&#x27;s attempt to soften the event&#x27;s racist aspect. Paul marched in the college section in her cap and gown, not with the Illinois delegation that Wells-Barnett joined. Wells-Barnett marched with two white Illinois women who had supported her right to march with the state delegation: Belle Squire and Virginia Brooks.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for five awards at 56th Primetime Emmy Awards, none of which were won; three awards at the 62nd Golden Globe Awards, winning one; and two awards at the 9th Golden Satellite Awards, winning one. Anjelica Huston won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance in the film.

<text>Jules Marcel Gros (; 2 February 1890 – 25 December 1992) was a Breton linguist specializing in the Breton language. He was born in Paris.

Gros&#x27; studies began very early in the twentieth century, from his grandmother and other people in his village who were still unilingual Breton speakers. Gros authored &quot;Stylistique Trégorroise&quot; and various dictionaries of Breton. His books were used by a generation of students, and continue to be important as reference works cataloguing the speech patterns of the Breton language.

Gros died on 25 December 1992 in Trédrez-Locquémeau.

<doc id="1164653" wikidata="Q316179" url="?curid=1164653" title="Moses Malone">
<text>Moses Eugene Malone Sr. (March 23, 1955 – September 13, 2015) was an American professional basketball player who played in both the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1974 through 1995. A center, he was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times, was a 12-time NBA All-Star and an eight-time All-NBA Team selection. Malone led the Philadelphia 76ers to an NBA championship in 1983, winning both the league and Finals MVP. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2001. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport&#x27;s history, Malone is also seen as one of the most underrated players in NBA history.

Malone began his professional career out of high school after he was selected in the third round of the 1974 ABA draft by the Utah Stars. He was named an ABA All-Star as a rookie and played two seasons in the league until it merged with the NBA in 1976. He landed in the NBA with the Buffalo Braves, who traded him after two games to the Houston Rockets. Malone became a five-time All-Star in six seasons with the Rockets. After leading the NBA in rebounding in 1979, he was named league MVP for the first time. He led the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981, and won his second MVP award in 1982. Traded to Philadelphia the following season, he repeated as MVP and led the 76ers to the 1983 championship. In his first of two stints with Philadelphia, he was an All-Star in each of his four seasons. Following another trade, Malone was an All-Star in his only two seasons with the then Washington Bullets (today&#x27;s Wizards). He signed as a free agent with the Atlanta Hawks, earning his 12th straight and final NBA All-Star selection in his first season. In his later years, he played with the Milwaukee Bucks before returning to the 76ers and completing his career with the San Antonio Spurs.

Malone was a tireless and physical player who led the NBA in rebounding six times, including a then-record five straight seasons (1981–1985). Nicknamed the &quot;Chairman of the Boards&quot; for his rebounding prowess, he finished his career as the all-time leader in offensive rebounds after leading both the ABA and NBA in the category a combined nine times. Combining his ABA and NBA statistics, Malone ranks ninth all-time in career points (29,580) and third in total rebounds (17,834). He was named to the ABA All-Time Team along with the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.

==Early life==
Malone was born in Petersburg, Virginia. He was an only child, raised primarily by his mother, Mary, who had dropped out of school after finishing the fifth grade. When Malone was two years old, Mary forced her husband to move out of their home due to his alcohol use. Malone&#x27;s father then moved to Texas.

Malone attended Petersburg High School, where he played basketball for the school&#x27;s Crimson Wave. The team went undefeated in his final two years, winning 50 games and back-to-back Virginia state championships. Malone signed a letter of intent to play college basketball for the University of Maryland under head coach Lefty Driesell.

==ABA career==

===Utah Stars (1974–1975)===
After the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association (ABA) selected him in the third round of the 1974 ABA Draft, Malone decided to become a professional, becoming the first player in modern professional basketball to enter directly from high school. He began his professional career with Utah in the 1974–75 season after signing a five-year contract worth $1 million. At and a somewhat skinny at the time, Malone began his pro career playing at forward until he bulked up enough to handle the rigors at center. As a rookie, he was named an ABA All-Star and earned ABA All-Rookie honors. In the 1975 ABA Playoffs, Malone averaged 22.7 points, 17.5 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game during a first round loss to the Denver Nuggets. After Malone&#x27;s rookie season concluded, the Chicago Bulls would try and draft him in the tenth round of the 1975 NBA draft, but their selection of him was considered ineligible due to the NBA&#x27;s four-year rule at the time.

===Spirits of St. Louis (1975–1976)===
Malone had been sidelined during all of the 1975–76 season for Utah with a leg injury when the Stars folded 16 games into the season. He was sold to the ABA&#x27;s Spirits of St. Louis to help pay down the Stars&#x27; debts, alongside Utah teammates Ron Boone, Randy Denton, and Steve Green. He played for the Spirits for the remainder of the 1975–76 season, though they did not make the playoffs since they finished with a 35–49 record. In his two seasons with the ABA, Malone averaged 17.2 points and 12.9 rebounds per game.

==NBA career==
===Buffalo Braves (1976)===
The ABA–NBA merger occurred after the 1975–76 season, but the Spirits of St. Louis were not among the ABA teams chosen to join the NBA. Malone had already been selected by the NBA&#x27;s New Orleans Jazz in a December 1975 pre-merger draft for ABA players of undergraduate age. However, the NBA let them place Malone into the 1976 ABA Dispersal Draft pool in exchange for the return of their first-round draft pick in 1977, which they used to trade for Gail Goodrich. In the 1976 dispersal draft, which was held for the remaining ABA players whose teams did not join the NBA, Malone was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the fifth overall pick.

The Blazers, who had also acquired power forward Maurice Lucas in the draft, chose Malone for trading purposes. With a frontline of Lucas, Bill Walton and Lloyd Neal, Portland figured Malone would see little action. They traded him to the Buffalo Braves prior to the first game of the 1976–77 season for a first-round draft choice in the 1978 NBA draft and $232,000. Malone played in two games with Buffalo. Because they could not meet Malone&#x27;s demands for playing time, they then traded him to the Houston Rockets in exchange for first-round draft picks in the 1977 and 1978 drafts.

===Houston Rockets (1976–1982)===

==== 1976–77 season ====
With the Houston Rockets, Malone played forward opposite Rudy Tomjanovich. He appeared in 82 games overall for both Buffalo and Houston and finished the season averaging 13.2 points per game (ppg) with 13.1 rebounds per game (rpg), ranking third in rpg. Malone set a then-NBA record with 437 offensive rebounds in a season, going on to surpass the mark two years later. Malone also blocked 2.21 shots per game, the seventh-most in the league. In the second game of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Washington Bullets, Malone recorded 15 offensive rebounds in the overtime win, setting an NBA playoff record. The Rockets reached the Eastern Conference Finals, where they lost 4–2 to the Philadelphia 76ers, his future team.

==== 1977–78 season: First All-Star selection ====
During his second season in the NBA, Malone was diagnosed with a stress fracture in his right foot, which caused him to miss the final 23 games. Despite the time missed to injury, Malone led the NBA with 380 total offensive rebounds and finished second with 15.0 rpg. His scoring improved to 19.4 ppg, and he made his first appearance in an NBA All-Star Game in 1978.

==== 1978–79 season: First MVP award ====
During the 1978–79 season, Malone emerged as one of the top centers in the league after gaining in the offseason. He averaged 24.8 points with a career-best .540 shooting percentage and established another career high with a league-leading 17.6 rpg while winning the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. He again led the league in offensive rebounds, setting an all-time single-season record with 587 offensive rebounds. He was voted to the All-NBA First Team and the All-Defensive Second Team. He was also voted by fans to start for the East at center in the 1979 NBA All-Star Game. On February 9, he grabbed a career-high 37 rebounds versus the New Orleans Jazz. Although the Rockets qualified for the playoffs, they were eliminated by the Atlanta Hawks in a first-round sweep. Malone averaged 24.5 points and 20.5 rebounds in the two games.

==== 1979–80 season ====
In 1979–80, Malone averaged 25.8 points, fifth-best in the NBA, and 14.5 rebounds, second-best in the league. He was named an All-Star for a third straight season and was also named to the All-NBA Second Team. In the opening round of the playoffs, Houston defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a best-of-three series. Malone registered 37 points and 20 rebounds in the deciding third game, leading the Rockets to a 141–120 victory. In the conference semifinals, the Rockets lost in a sweep to the Boston Celtics.

==== 1980–81 season: First NBA Finals appearance ====
In the 1980–81 season, Malone led the league with 14.8 rpg in 80 games and was again an All-Star as well as a member of the All-NBA Second Team. He finished second in scoring (28.8) to Adrian Dantley (30.7). On March 11, Malone scored 51 points against the Golden State Warriors. That postseason, Malone advanced the Rockets to the 1981 NBA Finals, by scoring 36 points and grabbing 11 rebounds in a decisive Game 5 Western Conference Finals win over the Kansas City Kings. In the finals, despite Malone averaging 22.3 points, 15.7 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks a game, he and the Rockets lost in six games to the Boston Celtics.

==== 1981–82 season: Second MVP award ====
In their first season in the Midwest Division, Houston and the Kansas City Kings tied for second place with identical 40–42 records. During the 1981-82 NBA season, Malone averaged 31.1 points with 14.7 rebounds and won his second MVP award. He repeated as the NBA leader in rebounds and was the runner-up for the league&#x27;s scoring title to George Gervin (32.3). He was also the league leader in offensive rebounds (558) and minutes played (3,398, 42.0 per game). At the end of the season Malone earned his second placement on the All-NBA First Team. He set a career-high in scoring average and also set a single-game career-high with 53 points on February 2 against the San Diego Clippers. Nine days later, on February 11 against the Seattle SuperSonics, Malone eclipsed his own league record with 21 offensive rebounds. In Malone&#x27;s last season in Houston the Rockets followed their NBA Finals appearance in 1981 with a first-round exit in the 1982 playoffs. Though he averaged 24.0 points with 17.0 rebounds, Seattle defeated Houston 2–1.

===Philadelphia 76ers (1982–1986)===

==== 1982–83 season: Championship season and Finals MVP ====
Malone became a restricted free agent after the 1981–82 season. He signed an offer sheet of six-years for $13.2 million with the Philadelphia 76ers on September 2, 1982. The 76ers were coming off a 4–2 loss in the Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers, whose center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, outplayed their big-man duo of Darryl Dawkins and Caldwell Jones. The Rockets franchise was sold, and the new owners decided that Malone&#x27;s $2 million annual salary did not fit their plans. Houston matched the offer and agreed to trade Malone to the 76ers for Jones and their first-round pick in the 1983 NBA draft on September 15. With Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones, the Sixers ran away from the league en route to the NBA championship. Malone was named the league MVP for the second straight year, becoming the only NBA player ever to win the award in consecutive seasons with two different teams, a feat matched only by Barry Bonds (1992–1993) in the four major American sports leagues.

That year, Malone averaged 15.3 rebounds per game, which led the league for the third consecutive year, and also averaged 24.5 points, which was fifth-best in the NBA. He was an All-Star for the sixth consecutive season and earned first-team honors on both the All-NBA and All-Defensive teams. The 76ers lost only one game in the postseason as they won the league championship, defeating the Lakers in a 4–0 sweep in the 1983 NBA Finals. In 13 playoff games, Malone averaged 26.0 points with 15.8 rebounds. He was named the Finals MVP, having outrebounded Abdul-Jabbar 72–30 in the series. It was also around this time that Malone began to tutor Hakeem Olajuwon, passing on the torch to the future Rockets superstar.

His head coach Billy Cunningham said, &quot;Let&#x27;s not make believe. The difference from last year was Moses.&quot; Before the playoffs began, Malone predicted in Southern vernacular that Philadelphia would go &quot;fo, fo, fo&quot;, envisioning a four-game sweep in each of the playoffs&#x27; three rounds, playing the minimum 12 games. His prediction (and its formulation) became famous: &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an enduring quotation&quot; and &quot;an unforgettable line,&quot; and Comcast SportsNet called it &quot;one of the greatest rallying cries ever uttered.&quot; As it transpired, the Sixers only lost one playoff game (Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals to the Milwaukee Bucks) en route to making Malone a world champion for the first time, sweeping the Knicks in the first round and the Lakers in the finals. This led to the inside of that year&#x27;s championship ring being inscribed &quot;fo&#x27; fi&#x27; fo (four, five, four).&quot; The 76ers&#x27; 12–1 cruise through the 1983 playoffs was, at the time, the most dominant playoff run in NBA history.

==== 1983–84 season ====
In the 1983–84 season Malone led the league in rebounding with 13.4 rpg. He was limited to 71 games that season due to ankle injuries, his lowest since the 1977–78 season. Malone scored 22.7 ppg in his second season with Philadelphia and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. Malone was selected again for the All-Star Game but he was unable to play because of an ankle injury. During the season he averaged 21.4 points with 13.8 rebounds in five games in the playoffs, but Philadelphia lost in a first-round upset against the New Jersey Nets.

==== 1984–85 season ====
The Sixers selected Charles Barkley in the 1984 NBA draft. When he reported to training camp at , Malone began to mentor him, encouraging him to get in better shape. Barkley got down to and made the NBA All-Rookie Team. In the 1984–85 season, Malone recorded 13.1 rpg, leading the NBA in rebounding for a record-setting fifth straight season (since surpassed by Dennis Rodman with seven consecutive seasons). He was voted by a fan ballot to the All-Star team for the eighth time and finished the season with 24.6 ppg, which ranked ninth-best in the league. He received his fourth All-NBA First Team honor and finished third in the NBA Most Valuable Player Award balloting; the award was won by Larry Bird. Malone scored his 15,000th NBA point on November 28, and grabbed his 10,000th NBA rebound on March 29. He scored 51 points against the Detroit Pistons on November 14. The 76ers reached the Eastern Conference Finals in 1985 but were defeated 4–1 by the Celtics.

==== 1985–86 season ====
Malone&#x27;s 1985–86 season ended when he suffered an orbital fracture in his right eye in a March 28 game against the Bucks. Despite hopes that he might return during the playoffs, he was ruled out for the postseason. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Philadelphia lost 4–3 to the Bucks. Malone averaged 23.8 points with 11.8 rebounds in 74 appearances that season. He ranked seventh in the league in scoring and fourth in rebounding, ending his five-season streak as the NBA rebounding champion. Malone was named an All-Star, but he was not named to the All-NBA Team, the first time he was not selected since 1978.

===Washington Bullets (1986–1988)===
Shortly after the 1985–86 season, Philadelphia traded Malone, Terry Catledge, and two first-round draft picks to the Washington Bullets in exchange for Jeff Ruland and Clifford T. Robinson. Malone bounced back from an injury-shortened 1985–86 campaign, averaging 24.1 points with 11.3 rebounds. He was named to his 10th consecutive All-Star Game and again was named to the All-NBA Second Team. Malone was the only player to finish in the top 10 in both ppg and rpg; he placed ninth in both categories.

Malone scored his 20,000th NBA point on April 12 against the Detroit Pistons. He scored 50 points versus the New Jersey Nets on April 8, joining Earl Monroe (56) and Phil Chenier (52) as the only Bullets players ever to score 50 points in a game. Washington appeared in the postseason but was swept by the Pistons in the first round. Malone averaged 20.7 points and 12.7 rebounds in the series.

In his 12th NBA season, Malone ranked eighth in the NBA in rebounding (11.2) and 19th in scoring (20.3). Malone was named to his 11th consecutive All-Star Game in 1988. Malone scored in double figures in 76 of 79 games and recorded 55 double-doubles for the year. The Bullets reached the 1988 NBA Playoffs, but lost to Detroit 3–2 in their first-round series. Malone averaged 18.6 points with 11.2 rebounds in the series.

===Atlanta Hawks (1988–1991)===

==== 1988–89 season: Final All-Star selection ====
Before the 1988–89 season, Malone agreed to a three-year deal to play with the Atlanta Hawks. The Hawks, featuring Dominique Wilkins, had won at least 50 games in the prior three seasons, and believed the free-agent center was a missing piece to a potential championship team. During the season, Malone averaged 20.2 points with 11.8 rebounds, becoming the first and only player in professional history to average 20 points and 10 rebounds for four different teams. He was voted by a fan ballot to the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, which was his 12th straight and final appearance. Malone reached double figures in points in 75 of his 81 games and recorded double figures in rebounds 55 times. On February 4, 1989, he scored a season-high 37 points against the Phoenix Suns. The Hawks were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by Milwaukee. In the series, Malone scored 21.0 ppg and had 12.0 rpg.

==== 1989–90 season ====
The following season, Malone finished with 18.9 ppg and 10.0 rpg, ending a string of 11 consecutive 20–10 campaigns. Malone led the NBA with 364 offensive rebounds and tied for eighth in rpg. In Mike Fratello&#x27;s final year as head coach, Atlanta finished with a 41–41 record, failing to qualify for the playoffs. Malone began the 1990–91 season as the Hawks&#x27; starting center, but after 15 games, Atlanta&#x27;s new coach, Bob Weiss, made Jon Koncak the starter and Malone his backup for the final 67 contests.

==== 1990–91 season ====
Coming off the bench for the first time in his career, Malone averaged 10.6 points with 8.1 rebounds in 23.3 minutes per game while starting just 18 of 82 games played during the 1990–91 season—all career lows at that point. On November 3, against the Indiana Pacers, Malone became the NBA career leader in free throws made with 7,695, besting the previous record set by Oscar Robertson. On November 21, against the Bucks, Malone scored his 25,000th career point. On March 15, he recorded his 15,000th career rebound against the Dallas Mavericks. Malone surpassed Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s mark of consecutive games without fouling out with his 1,046th straight game against the Detroit Pistons on April 19. The Hawks returned to the playoffs but were eliminated in the first round by Detroit, 3–2. In the series, Malone averaged just 4.2 points with 6.2 rebounds.

===Milwaukee Bucks (1991–1993)===
A free agent after the 1990–91 season, Malone signed a two-year contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. Malone was reported to earn $1.6 million in the first season and $2 million for the second season. Malone once again started at center during the 1991–92 season, averaging 15.6 points with 9.1 rebounds while playing in all 82 games. He led the Bucks in rebounding and finished second on the team in scoring. He scored a season-high 30 points twice and grabbed 19 rebounds against the Seattle SuperSonics on March 27. Milwaukee finished with a 31–51 record, tied for last place of the Central Division with the Charlotte Hornets.

After one practice in training camp in October 1992, Malone was sidelined due to a herniated disc in his back. After trying to play through the pain, he decided to have surgery in November. Recovery from the surgery caused Malone to miss the majority of the 1992–93 season. He returned to the Bucks on March 27, appearing in 11 games during the remainder of the season. Struggling with the younger players on their roster, the Bucks finished 28–54 and last in the Central Division.

===Return to Philadelphia (1993–1994)===
The Philadelphia 76ers signed Malone as a free agent in August, so that he could serve as a backup and mentor to rookie Shawn Bradley. Malone appeared in 55 games as a reserve for the 76ers, averaging 5.3 points with 4.1 rebounds.

===San Antonio Spurs (1994–1995)===
In 1994, Malone signed with the San Antonio Spurs, where he was used as a back-up center to David Robinson. The 1994–95 NBA season was his last in the NBA, and at that time, he was the only remaining active former ABA player. During the final game of his NBA career, against the Charlotte Hornets, he hit a buzzer-beating three-point shot from the opposing free throw line, away from the basket. He played 17 games for the Spurs.

==Player profile==
Malone stood and weighed . Described as &quot;relentless&quot; and &quot;a force on the boards like no other,&quot; he pounded his opponents into submission with ferocious effort and physical play. Nicknamed &quot;Chairman of the Boards&quot; for his rebounding prowess, he was notable for rebounding and scoring off his own misses, possessing the strength, quickness, and zeal to recover the ball before his opponents. This led to some contending he intentionally missed shots to pad his rebounding statistics. He was not a very good passer. When Carroll Dawson, an assistant coach with the Rockets, suggested that Malone needed to improve his passing, he replied, &quot;They ain&#x27;t paying me to pass.&quot;

He finished his career with the most combined ABA and NBA offensive rebounds (7,382), 35 percent over runner-up Artis Gilmore. Nine times he led his respective league in offensive rebounds, and five other times he finished in the top three. He also holds NBA records for the most offensive rebounds in a career (6,731), season (587), and game (21). Malone was a 13-time All-Star, and earned eight All-NBA selections, ranking ninth all-time with 29,580 points, and third with 17,834 rebounds. He is one of three players to exceed 28,000 points and 17,000 rebounds. He also ranks second all-time in free throws made (9,018) and attempted (11,864). Malone is one of just eight players who have been named NBA MVP three or more times. He led the league in rebounds six times, including five straight from 1980 through 1985. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility in 2001. The Rockets retired his No. 24 jersey in 1998, and the 76ers retired his No. 2 on February 8, 2019. In addition to retiring Malone&#x27;s jersey number, the 76ers also unveiled a statue in front of the team&#x27;s training facility in Camden, New Jersey. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Malone as the 18th greatest player in NBA history.

==Personal life==
Malone and his wife, Alfreda Gill, had two sons, Moses Eugene Jr. and Michael Malone. Alfreda sued for divorce in September 1991, on the grounds of irreconcilable differences, cruelty, and adultery. She got a restraining order in June 1992, ordering Malone to refrain from contact with her during the course of the lawsuit. At that time, Malone denied allegations that he abused his wife or threatened to kill her. The divorce was granted in October 1992.

In January 1993, Malone was arrested driving in Galveston, Texas, across Galveston Bay from his former wife&#x27;s home, for having violated a peace bond Alfreda had obtained. Her affidavit for its issuance alleged that Malone had stalked her, illegally entered her home in League City, Texas, damaged her property and threatened to kill her. Malone posted bail and was released.

Malone dated Leah Nash, whom he had met in 2006, though they did not marry nor live together. They had a son, Micah Francois Malone, who was six years old at the time of Malone&#x27;s death.

===Death===
Malone died in his sleep from heart disease at the age of 60, on the morning of September 13, 2015, at a hotel in Norfolk, Virginia. He had been scheduled to play in a charity golf tournament that day and was found unresponsive in his room when he did not appear for breakfast or answer his phone. Malone had previously complained of an irregular heartbeat and was reported to have been wearing a heart monitor when he died.

<text>Chief mechanical engineer and locomotive superintendent are titles applied by British, Australian, and New Zealand railway companies to the person ultimately responsible to the board of the company for the building and maintaining of the locomotives and rolling stock. In Britain, the post of &quot;locomotive superintendent&quot; was introduced in the late 1830s, and &quot;chief mechanical engineer&quot; in 1886.

==Emerging professional roles==
In the early Victorian era, projected canal or railway schemes were prepared by groups of promoters who hired specialists such as civil engineers, surveyors, architects or contractors to survey a route; and this resulted in the issue of a prospectus setting out their proposals. Provided that adequate capital could be raised from potential investors, agreements obtained from the landowners along the proposed route and, in Britain, an Act of Parliament obtained (different terminology is used in other countries), then construction might begin either by a new company specially formed to build and run it or by an existing company.

Design, construction and day-to-day operation of the canal or railway was managed by men who might otherwise work for the promoters. Some of the pioneer railway builders were self-taught, but others had gained their engineering experience constructing canals, or in military service. In Britain, the Institution of Civil Engineers had been founded in London in 1818, with Thomas Telford as its first president and its formation pre-dated many of the railway schemes. It obtained a Royal Charter in 1828. Later, the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was formed in 1847, with George Stephenson as its first president. The Corps of Royal Engineers, a British military organisation, was older than both of these civilian engineering institutions and it had extensive experience of (military) railway operations. For this reason, for almost 150 years from its foundation by the Board of Trade in 1840, Her Majesty&#x27;s Railway Inspectorate recruited suitably qualified retired officers from the Corps into its &quot;senior&quot; arm, as &quot;railway inspecting officers&quot;. These officers retained their former military rank within the Inspectorate. It was to be 1985 before a railway inspecting officer without a previous military career was appointed: the officer transferred across from the &quot;junior&quot; arm: as a former &quot;railway employment inspector&quot;. Over the same period, of almost a century and a half, the Inspectorate was headed by a retired officer of the Corps of Royal Engineers as its &quot;chief inspecting officer&quot;. Other, former army officers, such as Charles Blacker Vignoles, were to gain new careers on the railways when they became under-employed after the Napoleonic War.

In Britain, the various railway companies appointed and employed an engineer or chief engineer, who was usually a civil engineer by profession. This was a permanent management role in the company in contrast to that of contractors, for instance, who were only hired to perform specific tasks such as construction of the line. The chief engineer had his own department (and budget) and was an important company official. The chief engineer was responsible for all engineering functions: civil, which included bridges, viaducts, tunnels and track; and, later, mechanical, which included rolling stock. In some early railways, such as the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR), which opened in 1830, there was indecision on whether to use fixed engines and ropes or moving locomotives. Cases had arisen of locomotives being too heavy and breaking the cast iron rails that they had to run on; and locomotive wheels breaking and/or falling off. Finally, the L&amp;MR&#x27;s board agreed the use of moving locomotives; and the rolling stock was selected from various specialist builders by competition, at the Rainhill Trials. Soon afterwards, many railway companies were to set up their own railway workshops, although railway companies continued to buy-in locomotives from specialist manufacturers, such as Robert Stephenson and Company which was founded by George and Robert Stephenson in 1828. Some railway companies operated their own ferries, boats, and ships and these would also be the responsibility of their Chief Engineer, but they would have been ordered from shipyards. Isambard Kingdom Brunel set an example, designing three great steamships: the SS Great Western, the SS Great Britain and the SS Great Eastern – the first two being built at Bristol shipyards and the third at Millwall, London. The Institute of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland was formed in 1857 as a professional body for these trades in Scotland.

The specialism of mechanical engineering became established on the railways, with an emphasis on moving parts; and, in terms of importance, this was concerned with designing and building of reliable locomotives, carriages and waggons. Private companies designed and built these items to order and could offer standard designs to railway companies as well as &quot;specials&quot; to meet specific customer&#x27;s requirements; otherwise railway companies could and did establish workshops to build their own locomotives and carriages. In August 1837, for example, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the Engineer responsible for the Great Western Railway, appointed Daniel Gooch locomotive superintendent to the company; and it was his responsibility to provide the locomotives, the accommodation for them and the running and the repair shops. Gooch suggested a green field site, New Swindon, and this was to lead to the building of a railway works, a railway village and eventually the town of Swindon. Swindon was not the only example of railway town or community that was created in England: Crewe being another.

==Locomotive superintendent==
Initially, when a railway company chose to build its own rolling stock in house, the mechanical engineering aspect was regarded as a subsidiary function to that of the chief engineer and this was reflected in various job titles, such as &quot;chief of locomotive department&quot;, &quot;locomotive foreman&quot; and &quot;locomotive superintendent&quot;.

Later, there was a desire to improve the prestige, and salary, of the locomotive superintendent and a means of achieving those aims was to seek to regrade the post as chief mechanical engineer (CME). John Aspinall of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was the first CME to be appointed to that post in 1886. A further six British railway companies created the post of CME between 1902 and 1914.

==Functions==
The chief mechanical engineer was responsible for all aspects of locomotives and that included their design, testing and modification of existing designs.

The early mechanical engineer was concerned with mechanical moving parts and for many years this responsibility also included railway signalling, particularly points and semaphore signals, as these were entirely mechanically operated. With the introduction of low-power electricity to the railways, various new systems such as telegraphs, telephones and electrical signalling systems were introduced; and responsibilities of these systems were transferred to the signal and telegraph (S&amp;T) department.

<text>Alpha Persei (Latinized from α Persei, abbreviated Alpha Per, α Per), formally named Mirfak (pronounced or ), is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Perseus, outshining the constellation&#x27;s best-known star, Algol (β Persei). Alpha Persei has an apparent visual magnitude of 1.8, and is a circumpolar star when viewed from mid-northern latitudes.

Alpha Persei lies in the midst of a cluster of stars named as the eponymous Alpha Persei Cluster, or &quot;Melotte 20&quot;, which is easily visible in binoculars and includes many of the fainter stars in the constellation. Determined distance using the trigonometric parallax, places the star from the Sun.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;α Persei&quot; is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation.

The star also bore the traditional names Mirfak and Algenib, which are Arabic in origin. The former, meaning &#x27;Elbow&#x27; and also written Mirphak, Marfak or Mirzac, comes from the Arabic &quot;Mirfaq al-Thurayya&quot;, while Algenib, also spelt Algeneb, Elgenab, Gęnib, Chenib or Alchemb, is derived from الجنب &quot;al-janb&quot;, or الجانب &quot;al-jānib&quot;, &#x27;the flank&#x27; or &#x27;side&#x27;. and was also the traditional name for Gamma Pegasi. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included &quot;Mirfak&quot; for this star (Gamma Pegasi was given the name &quot;Algenib&quot;).

&quot;Hinaliʻi&quot; is the name of the star in Native Hawaiian astronomy. The name of the star is meant to commemorate a great tsunami and mark the beginning of the migration of Maui. According to some Hawaiian folklore, Hinaliʻi is the point of separation between the Earth and the sky that happened during the creation of the Milky Way.

Assemani alluded to a title on the Borgian globe, &quot;Mughammid&quot; (مغمد), or &quot;Muliammir al Thurayya&quot; (ملىمرٱلطرى), the Concealer of the Pleiades, which, from its location, may be for this star.

This star, together with γ Persei, δ Persei, η Persei, σ Persei and ψ Persei, has been called &quot;the Segment of Perseus&quot;.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Celestial Boat&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of α Persei, γ Persei, δ Persei, η Persei, μ Persei, ψ Persei, 48 Persei and HD 27084. Consequently, the Chinese name for α Persei itself is (, ).

== Physical properties ==

The spectrum of Alpha Persei matches a stellar classification of F5 Ib, revealing it to be a supergiant star in the latter stages of its evolution. It has a similar spectrum to Procyon A, though the latter star is much less luminous. This difference is highlighted in their spectral designation under the Yerkes spectral classification, published in 1943, where stars are ranked on luminosity as well as spectral typing. Procyon A is thus F5 IV, a subgiant star. Since 1943, the spectrum of Alpha Persei has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

Alpha Persei has about 7.3 times the Sun&#x27;s mass and has expanded to roughly 53 times the size of the Sun. It is radiating 3,800 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of , which creates the yellow-white glow of an F-type star. In the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, Alpha Persei lies inside the region in which Cepheid variables are found. It is thus useful in the study of these stars, which are important standard candles.

== Unconfirmed exoplanet ==

In 2010 evidence was presented of a planet orbiting Mirfak. Radial velocity data from repeated observations of the star found a periodic variation with an amplitude of 70.8 ± 1.6 m/s. The proposed planet is estimated to have a minimum mass of approximately 6.6 times that of Jupiter and an orbital period of 128 days, but the claimed period may not be stable over 20 years so the exoplanet is considered doubtful. Rotational modulation due to surface activity such as starspots seem a more likely explanation of the radial velocity variations. In previous publications, periodic radial velocity variations of 87.7 or 77.7 days have been reported, but these have not been confirmed.

<text>The Glengarry bonnet is a traditional Scots cap made of thick-milled woollen material, decorated with a toorie on top, frequently a rosette cockade on the left side, and ribbons hanging behind. It is normally worn as part of Scottish military or civilian Highland dress, either formal or informal, as an alternative to the Balmoral bonnet or Tam o&#x27; Shanter.

==History==

Traditionally, the Glengarry bonnet is said to have first appeared as the head dress of the Glengarry Fencibles when they were formed in 1794 by Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. MacDonell, therefore, is sometimes said to have invented the Glengarry – but it is not clear whether early pictures of civilians or Fencible infantry show a true glengarry, capable of being folded flat, or the standard military bonnet of the period merely cocked into a more &quot;fore-and-aft&quot; shape. The first use of the classic, military glengarry may not have been until 1841, when it is said to have been introduced for the pipers of the 79th Foot by the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Lauderdale Maule.

It was only in the 1850s that the Glengarry became characteristic undress headgear of the Scottish regiments of the British Army. By 1860, the Glengarry without a diced border and usually with a feather had been adopted by pipers in all regiments except the 42nd (Black Watch), whose pipers wore the full dress feather bonnet. In 1914, all Scottish infantry regiments were wearing dark blue Glengarries in non-ceremonial orders of dress, except for the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) who wore them in rifle green, and the Scots Guards, who wore peaked forage caps or khaki service dress caps.

The diced bands on Glengarries were either in red, white and blue for royal regiments or red, white and green for others. The toories on top could be red, royal blue or black, according to regiment. The Black Watch and Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders, however, wore Glengarries without dicing and The 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders were unique in wearing a simple red and white chequer pattern. This was said to commemorate the stand of the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders at the Battle of Balaclava immortalized as the Thin Red Line.

Between 1868 and 1897, the Glengarry was also worn as an undress cap for most British soldiers until replaced by the short-lived Austrian cap, replaced in turn in 1902 by the Brodrick cap (to which a peak was added to produce the design of cap worn in regimental colours with undress and in khaki with Service Dress at the start of the First World War). When the Austrian-style side cap was revived in 1937 as the Universal Pattern Field Service Cap (used by the British Army in the Second World War), the &quot;Dress Regulations for the Army,&quot; described it as &quot;similar in shape to the Glengarry&quot;.

==Modern wear==
The Glengarry continued to be worn in dark blue by all regiments of the Scottish Division up to their final amalgamation into the Royal Regiment of Scotland in 2006. In parade dress, it was worn by all regiments except the Black Watch, who wore the blue Balmoral bonnet, and musicians of some regiments, who wore feather bonnets in full dress. The Black Watch, however, wore a plain blue Glengarry in some orders of dress with trews. The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) wore a plain rifle green Glengarry up until their disbandment in 1968. The blue Glengarry currently worn by the Royal Regiment of Scotland has red, green and white dicing, a red toorie, black silk cockade and the regimental cap badge surmounted by a blackcock (&quot;Tetrao tetrix&quot;) feather. This last is a tradition taken from the Royal Scots and King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. Other Commonwealth military forces that have Scottish and Highland regiments also make use of the Glengarry.

===Irish Army===
The headdress worn by Irish Army&#x27;s Cavalry Corps is called a Glengarry but is more similar to the caubeen in appearance, than to the Scottish headdress of the same name. It was designed in 1934 for the Cavalry Corps as a more practical headdress than the standard peaked cap in the confines of their armoured cars and tanks. The Glengarry is the same colour as the army&#x27;s service dress uniform with a black band and two black swallow-tail ribbons at the rear. The cap badge is worn over the left eye. Officers in the RDF wear a similar Glengarry but with green band and ribbons as part of their service dress uniform. Army pipers and drummers wear a black Glengarry with a saffron band and ribbons and a dark green feather hackle.

==Civilian wear==

The Glengarry is worn by male members of staff at the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the King&#x27;s Official residence in Scotland.

The Glengarry is also commonly worn by civilians, notably civilian pipe bands, but can be considered an appropriate hat worn by any man with Highland casual dress or day wear. In this context, it most often has a red toorie. In pipe bands, women often also wear the Glengarry.

The Glengarry is the headdress stipulated in Dress Regulations for Officers of the Boys&#x27; Brigade; namely Warrant Officers, Lieutenants and Brevet Captains.

==Police use of diced band==
In 1932 Percy Sillitoe, the Chief Constable of the City of Glasgow Police, abolished the traditional custodian helmet and added a new feature to the peaked caps worn by his police officers. This new feature was a black and white chequered cap band based on the dicings seen on the Glengarry headdress of the Scottish regiments. The diced band, popularly known as the Sillitoe tartan, later spread to police forces in Australia, New Zealand, and the rest of the United Kingdom, as well as to some other parts of the world, notably Chicago.

==Method of wearing==
The correct method of wearing the Glengarry has changed since the end of the Second World War. Prior to 1945, Glengarries were generally worn steeply angled, with the right side of the cap worn low, often touching the ear, and the side with the capbadge higher on the head. The trend since the end of the war has been to wear the Glengarry level on the head, with the point directly over the right eye.

<text>Henry Alfred Ivatt (16 September 1851, Wentworth, Cambridgeshire – 25 October 1923) was an English railway engineer, and was the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Great Northern Railway from 1896 to 1911.

== Career ==

===London and North Western Railway===

Educated at Liverpool College., at age 17, Ivatt was apprenticed to John Ramsbottom at the Crewe Works of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). He worked as a fireman for six months and held various positions there. He was made head of the Holyhead Locomotive Depot in 1874, before being promoted to the head of the Chester District.

===Great Southern and Western Railway===
In 1877, Ivatt moved to Ireland, and the Great Southern and Western Railway at Inchicore. In 1882, he was appointed to the post of locomotive engineer there, where he patented a design for a sprung flap for vertically-opening carriage windows that became ubiquitous.

===Great Northern Railway===
In 1895, Ivatt returned to England and was appointed Locomotive Superintendent of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), succeeding Patrick Stirling, with references from Samuel Waite Johnson, John Aspinall, Francis William Webb and William Dean.

===Locomotive designs===
At the GNR, he became associated with the GNR Class C1 (small boiler) and GNR Class C1 (large boiler) 4-4-2 (Atlantic) type, which he introduced to Britain. Ivatt was also the first to introduce Walschaerts valve gear to Britain. Ivatt retired on 2 December 1911. He was succeeded as Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the GNR by Nigel Gresley.

==Family==
He had six children, the first of whom, Campbell, died as a child in 1898. His son George Ivatt was also a locomotive engineer and post-war CME of the London Midland and Scottish Railway. His daughter Marjorie married Oliver Bulleid, CME of the Southern Railway (Great Britain).

==Death==
Ivatt died in 1923 in Haywards Heath, Sussex.

<text>Bruce Channel ( ; born November 28, 1940) is an American singer-songwriter best known for his 1962 number-one hit record &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;.

==Career==
Channel performed originally for the radio program &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot; and then joined with the harmonica player Delbert McClinton, singing country music. Channel wrote &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; with Margaret Cobb in 1959 and performed the song for two years before recording it for Fort Worth record producer Bill Smith. It was issued originally on Smith&#x27;s LeCam label, but as it started to sell well, it was acquired for distribution by Smash Records, a subsidiary of Mercury. The song went to number one in the US in March 1962 and held that position for three weeks. Besides topping the U.S. popular music charts, it also became number two in the United Kingdom. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. Channel had four more singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including &quot;Number One Man&quot; (which peaked at number 52), &quot;Come On Baby&quot; (number 98), &quot;Going Back to Louisiana&quot; (number 89), and &quot;Mr. Bus Driver&quot; (number 90, produced by Dale Hawkins in Memphis and recorded by Terry Manning), but none of them was as successful as &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;, and he is considered a one-hit wonder.

Channel toured Europe and was assisted at one gig by the Beatles, who were then little known. John Lennon, who had &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; on his jukebox, was fascinated by McClinton&#x27;s harmonica. A popular legend is that Lennon was taught to play harmonica by McClinton, but by that time Lennon had already been playing the instrument live for some time. The harmonica segment in &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; inspired Lennon&#x27;s playing on the Beatles&#x27; first single, 1962&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, as well as later Beatles records, and the harmonica break on Frank Ifield&#x27;s &quot;I Remember You.&quot;

Channel&#x27;s only other top 40 recording in the UK Singles Chart was &quot;Keep On&quot; (June 1968), which reached number 12; it was written by Wayne Carson Thompson and produced by Dale Hawkins. &quot;Keep On&quot; also charted in Australia. Channel disliked touring, so he settled as a songwriter in Nashville, scoring a number of Broadcast Music Incorporated award-winning songs during the 1970s and 1980s – &quot;As Long As I&#x27;m Rockin&#x27; with You&quot;, for John Conlee; &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry &#x27;bout Me Baby&quot;, for Janie Fricke; &quot;Party Time&quot;, for T. G. Sheppard; &quot;You&#x27;re the Best&quot;, for Kieran Kane; and &quot;Stand Up&quot;, for Mel McDaniel. In 1987, &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; was featured in the popular movie &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;.

In 1995, Channel recorded his cover of the song &quot;Stand Up&quot; for the Memphis-based record label Ice House. Delbert McClinton reprised his harmonica role on it and several other tracks, including another version of &quot;Hey! Baby&quot;. Channel then recorded a project in 2002 with the singer-songwriter Larry Henley (ex-Newbeats), billed as Original Copy.

Channel was inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He continues to perform in cruises with other 1960s musicians.

<doc id="1164672" wikidata="Q5009038" url="?curid=1164672" title="CBC Radio One local programming">
<text>Stations in Canada&#x27;s CBC Radio One network each produce some local programming in addition to the network schedule.

The amount of local programming may vary from station to station. For instance, some stations in smaller markets may produce their own morning show but air an afternoon show from another station. Some stations in major markets also preempt some regular network programming in favour of an extended local schedule.

Some regional programming is also produced which is shared by all stations in a province. This most commonly applies to daily noon-hour shows, weekend morning shows and a Saturday afternoon arts and culture magazine.
==Content==

Local programs on CBC Radio One feature news and human interest content local to the region they serve. Each program also includes both national and local news headline segments. Some general content segments, such as business news reports, science news reports and entertainment reviews, air across the network on all local programs.

Some local segments from the various morning and afternoon programs are also aired on the national network program &quot;The Story from Here&quot;.

At the top of each hour during the morning and afternoon programs, national newscasts – &quot;World Report&quot; in the mornings and &quot;The World This Hour&quot; in the afternoons – air for the first ten minutes. A shorter local newscast typically airs at the half-hour mark.

On statutory holidays, nearly all local programming is preempted in favour of network-wide special programming. In heavily populated provinces like Ontario, the various local morning shows within often rotate broadcasting for the entire province. On Christmas Day, the entire daytime broadcasting schedule, and most of the evening is preempted for holiday music programming except for news programming such as &quot;World Report&quot; and &quot;Your World Tonight&quot;.

==Weekday programming==

Local morning shows air from 5:30 am or 6 am local time, depending on the station, to 8:30 am. They are followed by a local news update, and then &quot;The Current&quot; at 8:37 am. The sole exception is &quot;Qulliq&quot;, the program from Nunavut, which begins at 6:30 am ET and airs until 9:30 am ET. As of the 2015-16 television season, the 6:00 a.m. hour of these programs outside of CBC North air on local CBC television stations.

Local afternoon shows on CBC Radio One air from 4 pm to 6 pm local time, except in Halifax, Ottawa, Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and Victoria, where they start at 3 pm. Rebroadcasters outside of those cities do not air the first hour of the extended afternoon shows; they stay with regional or conventional network programming and then rejoin their host station&#x27;s afternoon show at 4 pm.

In addition to the standard local programming blocks, the stations in Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and northern Quebec also preempt much of the network&#x27;s afternoon schedule to produce additional local programming in aboriginal languages. See CBC North for further information. (Pre-6 am morning show start times are listed in brackets in the table)

==Weekend programming==
Each province and territory also has a regional weekend morning show, which airs provincewide Saturday and Sunday mornings from 6 to 9 am, and most also have a regional arts and culture magazine which airs on Saturday afternoons scheduled around the live nationwide call-in show, &quot;Just Asking&quot;, depending on the local time zone. Stations in the Atlantic provinces air an additional regional arts and culture program on Sunday afternoons at 4 pm. AT, due in part to a hole in the schedule created by the fact that &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot; airs live across Canada at 5 pm. AT. CBI in Sydney airs the long running &quot;Island Echoes&quot;, a weekly cultural program on Saturday evenings at 8 p.m AT.

In parts of Western Canada, however, distinct Saturday afternoon arts and culture magazines are no longer aired; the stations air a repeat broadcast of the national network program &quot;Unreserved&quot;.

<doc id="1164681" wikidata="Q158628" url="?curid=1164681" title="Chromism">
<text>In chemistry, chromism is a process that induces a change, often reversible, in the colors of compounds. In most cases, chromism is based on a change in the electron states of molecules, especially the π- or d-electron state, so this phenomenon is induced by various external stimuli which can alter the electron density of substances. It is known that there are many natural compounds that have chromism, and many artificial compounds with specific chromism have been synthesized to date. It is usually synonymous with chromotropism, the (reversible) change in color of a substance due to the physical and chemical properties of its ambient surrounding medium, such as temperature and pressure, light, solvent, and presence of ions and electrons.

Chromism is classified by what kind of stimuli are used. Examples of the major kinds of chromism are as follows.

* [[thermochromism]] is chromism that is induced by heat, that is, a change of temperature. This is the most common chromism of all.
* [[photochromism]] is induced by light irradiation. This phenomenon is based on the isomerization between two different molecular structures, light-induced formation of color centers in crystals, precipitation of metal particles in a glass, or other mechanisms.
* [[electrochromism]] is induced by the gain and loss of electrons. This phenomenon occurs in compounds with redox active sites, such as metal ions or organic radicals.
*[[solvatochromism]] depends on the polarity of the solvent. Most solvatochromic compounds are metal complexes.

There are many more chromisms and these are listed below in .

The output from the chromisms described above is observed by a change in the absorption spectra of the chromic material. An increasingly important group of chromisms are those where changes are displayed in their emission spectra. Hence they are called fluorochromisms, exemplified by solvatofluorochromism, electrofluorochromism and mechanofluorochromism.

==Chromic phenomena==
Chromic phenomena are those phenomena in which color is produced when light interacts with materials, often called chromic materials in a variety of ways. These can be categorized under the following five headings:
*Stimulated (reversible) color change
*The absorption and reflection of light
*The absorption of energy followed by the emission of light
*The absorption of light and energy transfer (or conversion)
*The manipulation of light.

== Color change phenomena==
Those phenomena which involve the change in color of a chemical compound under an external stimulus fall under the generic term of chromisms. They take their individual names from the type of the external influence, which can be either chemical or physical, that is involved. Many of these phenomena are reversible. The following list includes all the classic chromisms plus many others of increasing interest in newer outlets.

There are also chromisms which involve two or more stimuli. Examples include:
*Photoelectrochromism – Photovoltachromism – Bioelectrochromism – Solvatophotochromism – Thermosolvatochromism – Halosolvatochromism – Electromechanochromism.

Color changes are also observed on the interaction of metallic nanoparticles and their attached ligands with another stimulus. Examples include plasmonic solvatochromism, plasmonic ionochromism, plasmonic chronochromism and plasmonic vapochromism.

==Commercial applications==

Color change materials have been used in several very common outlets but also in an increasing number of new ones. Commercial applications include photochromics in ophthalmics, fashion/cosmetics, security, sensors, optical memory and optical switches, thermochromics in paints, inks, plastics and textiles as indicators/sensors and in architecture, ionochromics in copy paper, direct thermal printing and textile sensors, electrochromics in car mirrors, smart windows, flexible devices and solar protection, solvatochromics in biological probes and sensors, gasochromics in windows and gas sensors.

==Dyes and pigments==
Classical dyes and pigments produce color by the absorption and reflection of light; these are the materials that make a major impact on the color of our daily lives. In 2000, world production of organic dyes was 800,000 tonnes and of organic pigments, 250,000 tonnes and the volume has grown at a steady rate throughout the early years of this century. In 2019 the value of the organic dyes/pigments market is forecast to be $19.5bn. Their value is exceeded by the very large production of inorganic pigments. Organic dyes are used mainly to color textile fibers, paper, hair, leather, while pigments are used largely in inks, paints, plastic and cosmetics. Both are used in the growth area of the digital printing of textiles, paper and other surfaces.

Dyes are also made using the properties of chromic substances: Examples being 
Photochromic dyes and
Thermochromic dyes

==Luminescence==
The absorption of energy followed by the emission of light is often described by the term &quot;luminescence&quot;. The exact term used is based on the energy source responsible for the luminescence as in color-change phenomena.
*Electrical – electroluminescence Galvanoluminescence Sonoluminescence.
*Photons (light) – Photoluminescence Fluorescence Phosphorescence Biofluorescence.
*Chemical – Chemiluminescence Bioluminescence Electrochemiluminescence.
*Thermal – Thermoluminescence Pyroluminescence Candololuminescence.
*Electron Beam – Cathodoluminescence Anodoluminescence Radioluminescence.
*Mechanical – Triboluminescence Fractoluminescence Mechanoluminescence Crystalloluminescence Lyoluminescence Elasticoluminescence.

Many of these phenomena are widely used in consumer products and other important outlets. Cathodoluminescence is used in cathode-ray tubes, photoluminescence in fluorescent lighting and plasma display panels, phosphorescence in safety signs and low energy lighting, fluorescence in pigments, inks, optical brighteners, safety clothing, and biological and medicinal analysis and diagnostics, chemoluminescence and bioluminescence in analysis, diagnostics and sensors, and electroluminescence in the burgeoning areas of light-emitting diodes (LEDs/OLEDs), displays and panel lighting. Important new developments are taking place in the areas of quantum dots and metallic nanoparticles.

==Light and energy transfer==
Absorption of light and energy transfer (or conversion) involves colored molecules that can transfer electromagnetic energy, commonly in the form of a laser light source, to other molecules in another form of energy, such as thermal or electrical. These laser addressable colorants, also called near-infrared absorbers, are used in thermal energy conversion, photosensitisation of chemical reactions and the selective absorption of light. Applications areas include optical data storage, as organic photoconductors, as sensitisers in photomedicine, such as photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy in the treatment of cancer, in photodiagnosis and phototheranostics, and in the photoinactivation of microbes, blood and insects. The absorption of natural sunlight by chromic materials/chromophores is exploited in solar cells for the production of electrical energy via solar cells, using both inorganic photovoltaics and organic materials (organic photovoltaics) and dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and also in the production of useful chemicals via artificial photosynthesis. A developing area is the conversion of light into kinetic energy, often described under the generic term of lightdriven molecular machines.

==Light manipulation==
Materials may be used to control and manipulate light via a variety of mechanisms to produce useful effects involving color. For instance, a change of orientation of molecules to produce a visual effect as in liquid crystal displays. Other materials operate by producing a physical effect, by interference and diffraction as in lustre pigments and optically variable pigments, colloidal photonic crystals and in holography. Increasingly inspiration is coming from Nature, in the form of bioinspired structural colors. Molecular materials are also used to increase the intensity of light by modifying its movement through the materials by electrical means, so increasing its intensity as in organic lasers, or in modifying the transmission of light through materials, as in opto-electronics, or by purely by all optical means as in optical limiters.

<doc id="1164683" wikidata="Q7864307" url="?curid=1164683" title="UEA Creative Writing Course">
<text>The University of East Anglia&#x27;s Creative Writing Course was founded by Sir Malcolm Bradbury and Sir Angus Wilson in 1970. The M.A. has been regarded among the most prestigious in the United Kingdom.

The course allows specialisation in the following strands: Prose, Creative Non-Fiction, Poetry, Scriptwriting (which is Skillset accredited) and Crime Fiction. In 2024, a new strand, MA Creative Writing, which allows students to work across different literary forms, was launched. Each strand results in an M.A. qualification upon successful completion of the course. Course Directors have included Andrew Cowan, Tessa McWatt, Tiffany Atkinson, Steve Waters, Kathryn Hughes, Lavinia Greenlaw, and Henry Sutton. Writers teaching on the course in recent years have included Amit Chaudhuri, Trezza Azzopardi, Giles Foden, Tobias Jones, James Lasdun, Jean McNeil and George Szirtes.

Writers such as Margaret Atwood, Angela Carter, Rose Tremain, Andrew Motion, W. G. Sebald, Michèle Roberts and Patricia Duncker have also taught on the course.

Writers-in-residence have included Alan Burns and Margaret Atwood. Ali Smith has been a Writing Fellow and Visiting Professor on the programme. From 2021 to 2022, Tsitsi Dangarembga was the inaugural International Chair of Creative Writing.

<doc id="1164691" wikidata="Q5530931" url="?curid=1164691" title="GenderPAC">
<text>GenderPAC (the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition) was an LGBT rights organization based in Washington, DC working to ensure that classrooms, communities, and workplaces were safe places for every person to learn, grow, and succeed, whether or not they conform to expectations for masculinity or femininity. It was active from 1995 to 2009.

==Activities==
Generally considered the first national political organization devoted to issues of &quot;gender identity and expression&quot; and representing the transgender community, GenderPAC aimed to promote understanding of the connection between discrimination based on gender stereotypes and gender, sexual orientation, age, race and class. GenderPAC&#x27;s major programs were Workplace Fairness, Gender Equality National Index for Universities &amp; Schools (GENIUS) Congressional Diversity Pledge, GenderYOUTH Network, and the Children As They Are parenting network.

The organization argued that violence and discrimination based on gender variance was not limited to people who identified as trans. It was often, however, categorised as a transgender rights organization.

GenderPAC&#x27;s annual budget grew to $250,000 in its first five years of existence, and topped out at $1,200,000 when it ceased operations in 2009. Most of its revenue came from LGBT funders and also from corporate sponsorships, with small amounts from individual donor contributions and events.

==History==
GenderPAC was founded in 1995 by Riki Wilchins as an association of existing transgender organizations, in response to a lack of inclusion of transgender and gender-variant issues by national gay and lesbian organizations, and grew quickly. Its areas of activism included incidents of discrimination against trans and gender-variant people, as well as youth and issues of workplace fairness.

In 1996, the group began holding National Gender Lobby Days, during which activists would meet with members of Congress to discuss discrimination and violence. One part of these events was a Congressional Diversity Pledge, which asked Members of Congress to affirm that their own office would not discriminate against employees because of their &quot;gender identity or expression.&quot; Signers included Jan Schakowsky, Jerrold Nadler, and Carolyn Maloney. Eventually almost 200 Members signed the Pledge, including two dozen Republicans and over a dozen Senators.

In 1997, GenderPAC produced &quot;The First National Study on Transviolence&quot;, a large research project on violence against transgender and gender-variant people. It was cited in the political struggle for hate crime protections for trans people.

GenderPAC was a member of the Hate Crimes Coalition that effected in 1999 the introduction of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, eventually passed in 2009. When the organization was founded, passing a trans-inclusive version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) was a priority. After GenderPAC visited Congressional offices in preparation for a Lobby Days event, with an HRC lobbyist along, allegations were offered by some transgender activists that Human Rights Campaign might have persuaded GenderPAC to shift its support to hate crime laws, saying that this would be more politically efficacious. However, GenderPAC fervently denied this, and no actual evidence for the allegations was ever provided.

The organization formally organized in 1999, with a new board of directors comprising individuals instead of groups, and received tax-exempt status as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

GenderPAC held the first National Conference on Gender in 2001, coinciding with the sixth annual Gender Lobby Days; one speaker was NOW president Patricia Ireland. The June 2001 issue of &quot;Time&quot; named Wilchins one of 100 national innovators.

In 2006 with Global Rights, GenderPAC researched and published &quot;50 Under 30: Masculinity and the War on America’s Youth&quot;. The first human rights report on fatal violence against gender-variant youth, &quot;50 Under 30&quot; documented an epidemic of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 50 young people aged 30 and under from 1996 to 2006. 82% were black or Latina/o, and virtually all were male-to-female transsexuals. Most were attacked by assailants within 5 to 10 years of their own age.

In 2008, with 17 new murders in just two years, the report was updated and reissued as &quot;70 Under 30&quot; help from the NYC Gay &amp; Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, which eventually took over the project and integrated it into its annual hate crimes report. Over 100 national and local groups endorsed the findings of &quot;50 Under 30,&quot; which was also adopted by members of the Hate Crimes Coalition on Capitol Hill, and provided by HRC to members of sub-committee that marked up the Mathew Shepherd Hate Crimes Act. The report was used by the House Hate Crimes Subcommittee, the federal-level activist Hate Crimes Coalition, the International Association of Police Chiefs, and the NYC Anti-Violence Project.

On May 28, 2009, GenderPAC closed its doors and shut down its website, citing the number of other organizations now doing the work that it was originally created for. Its GenderYOUTH network and resources were transferred to Choice USA.

==Criticism==
GenderPAC exemplified what certain feminists opposed about queer rights movements and certain elements of gender studies: Sheila Jeffreys wrote that its aims ignored women in favor of &quot;transgenders , most of whom are men, and homosexuality,&quot; and that the organization&#x27;s conception of gender as something that should be protected, and the basis for individuals rights that needed to be respected rather than eliminated, would serve to reinforce discrimination.

Conversely, other transgender rights organizations were angered by GenderPAC&#x27;s rejection of the label of a transgender organization and to focus on trans issues. These latter criticized GenderPAC&#x27;s reputed shift of focus away from a trans-inclusive ENDA at the supposed prompting of HRC, their unwillingness to engage with identity categories, and what they saw as a &quot;violation&quot; or exclusion of trans people through the use of their stories to raise money which was not spent primarily on trans issues.

In fact, GenderPAC&#x27;s Board and constituency remained heavily transgender from its founding until it ceased operations. Wilchins proposed that the focus of a gender rights struggle to be about the issue of gender discrimination, rather than identity of transgender, which might leave out many of those who suffered discrimination. This view brought the organization to crisis when it took on the case of a self-identified &quot;butch lesbian&quot; who sought help after being repeatedly harassed at work and ultimately fired for allegedly looking &quot;too masculine.&quot; Many on the Board said GenderPAC should only help transgender-identified individuals; others, including Wilchins, maintained that it was the issue of gender discrimination, rather than individual identity, that was paramount. It was a divide that GenderPAC struggled to bridge during its entire time in existence, and in many ways came to define the organization.

<doc id="1164696" wikidata="Q1509297" url="?curid=1164696" title="Pierre Palmade">
<text>Pierre Palmade (born 23 March 1968) is a French actor, comedian, stage director and playwright.

==Biography==
Pierre Palmade began his career in sketch comedy shows on stage and on television in the late 1980s, and in the 1990s he wrote and played his own stand-up acts. His signature humor was to portray unpleasant or irritating characters in his sketches. Palmade also wrote several plays with Muriel Robin, with whom they were notable in the 1990s for their play &quot;Ils s&#x27;aiment&quot; and its sequel &quot;Ils se sont aimés&quot;, both directed by Muriel Robin and played on stage by Palmade and Michèle Laroque. For his theater work, Palmade has been nominated several times for the Molière Awards.

In the late 1990s and 2000s, Palmade played in several films and TV series. In 2005, he participated in &quot;Rendez-vous en terre inconnue&quot;. He also worked as a writer for the films &quot;Pédale douce&quot; and &quot;Pédale dure&quot;. In 2007, he was the host of sketch comedy television show &quot;Made in Palmade&quot;; the following year, he wrote the play &quot;Le comique&quot;, which he played on stage with fellow actors from &quot;Made in Palmade&quot; and was followed by a sequel, &quot;Le Fils du Comique&quot; with Anne-Élisabeth Blateau at Théâtre Saint-Georges in Paris. In 2008, Palmade starred in the biographical film &quot;Sagan&quot;, a dramatization of the life of novelist Françoise Sagan directed by Diane Kurys, in which Palmade plays the role of dancer and socialite Jacques Chazot.

In 2010, after a ten-year hiatus from on-stage solo performances, Palmade came back with a new show &quot;J&#x27;ai jamais été aussi vieux&quot;. That same year, Palmade wrote the sketch comedy &quot;Le Grand Restaurant&quot;, featuring various celebrities such as Palmade, Anne-Élisabeth Blateau, Gérard Depardieu, François Berléand and Jean Rochefort. The prime-time television show was followed by three sequels, as of 2022. In 2018, Palmade wrote the play &quot;Paprika&quot;, played on stage at Théâtre de la Madeleine by Victoria Abril and Jean-Baptiste Maunier.

== Personal life ==
Palmade was married to singer Véronique Sanson from 1995 to 2004. In October 2008, Palmade came out as gay, his homosexuality was one of the topics of his 2010 autobiographical show &quot;J&#x27;ai jamais été aussi vieux&quot;.

In an interview in 2019, after being arrested for drug use, he publicly admitted he suffered from drug addiction, declaring: &quot;Cocaine has ruined my life since I was 20&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
===False rape accusation and drug charges===
On 12 April 2019, early in the morning, Palmade reportedly called the police, telling them that a nineteen-year-old man, who was in Palmade&#x27;s home in Paris, was damaging his property. When the police arrived, the young man told he was acting in self-defense, and in turn accused Palmade of raping him. Both men were put in custody.

Later that day, Palmade&#x27;s accuser admitted to making a false accusation of rape and Palmade was released from custody. However, the investigation into the incident led to Palmade being indicted for drug-related charges, to which he immediately pleaded guilty. In June, Palmade (who was previously convicted of cocaine use in 1995) was sentenced to a fine for his drug charges. His accuser was himself charged with drug use and criminal damage, and in October he was issued a three-month suspended sentence and a fine.

===Car accident, health and legal issues===
On 10 February 2023, Palmade was involved in a car accident, colliding head-on with another vehicle travelling on the other lane near Villiers-en-Bière in the south of Seine-et-Marne. Palmade was driving one of the vehicles, while the man who was driving the other vehicle was with his six-year-old son and his pregnant sister-in-law; all were seriously injured. Palmade was sent in critical condition to Bicêtre Hospital, but recovered the next day. Due to trauma of the accident, the female victim, who was more than six months pregnant, was taken to the hospital, where she had an emergency caesarean section which eventually resulted in the death of her baby.

While Palmade was hospitalized, investigation found that he was driving under the influence of cocaine at the time of the accident. The investigation also found that two other passengers were in Palmade&#x27;s car during the accident, and were wanted by the police for questioning.

On 15 February, police took Palmade into custody where he confessed to using drugs before the accident. On 17 February, it was reported that Palmade was indicted for severe bodily injury and involuntary manslaughter, and that he would be put under electronic tagging while being confined at a residential treatment center. On the same day, the two men who were in Palmade&#x27;s car during the accident were put into custody and questioned by the police. They recounted that after the accident, they got out of Palmade&#x27;s car and had walked away from the scene.

On the same day, a man contacted police and told them that Palmade was in possession of child pornography, which led to an investigation. Three days later, another man contacted police and the media, claiming he had proof that Palmade possessed child pornography. A raid made at Palmade&#x27;s home in Paris, and his house in Seine-et-Marne, found no illegal material.

On 25 February, it was reported that Palmade suffered a stroke and was transferred to Bicêtre Hospital. Two days later, Palmade was due to be put on remand while recovering from his stroke. On the same day, it was reported that the female victim&#x27;s life was no longer in danger, but her brother-in-law and his son remained in critical condition. On 14 March, the Court of Appeal of Paris declared that Palmade was no longer on remand, but would be kept under judicial supervision, and forbidden from leaving hospital.

Because of Palmade&#x27;s notoriety, the circumstances of the accident and subsequent revelations and speculation over his lifestyle, the accident received significant media coverage in France during February 2023. On 20 November 2024, Palmade was sentenced to 5 years in prison, including 2 years without remission.

<text>The Little Killers were an American rock and roll band who formed in New York City, New York, U.S. in 2001. They played punky garage rock inspired by the likes of Chuck Berry, the New York Dolls, and Johnny Burnette&#x27;s Rock &amp; Roll Trio.

The band featured vocalist and guitarist Andy Maltz, the rhythm sections of Sara Nelson (bass and backing vocals) and Kari Boden (drums and backing vocals).

After signing to Crypt Records, The Little Killers released their self-titled debut album in September 2003. It became a hit in garage punk circles, although it didn&#x27;t make the band as big as label-mates such as Jon Spencer Blues Explosion.

They also released two non-album singles, &quot;Better Be Right&quot; (2003) and &quot;You Got It Made&quot; (2004). That year also saw them play one of the final Peel Sessions broadcasts from the legendary John Peel radio show, before he died in 2004.

In 2006, they released their second and final album, &quot;A Real Good One&quot;, on the Gern Blandsten Records label.

The Little Killers toured extensively in the US, Europe, and Australia before disbanding in 2007.

<doc id="1164713" wikidata="Q5359732" url="?curid=1164713" title="Elevator surfing">
<text>Elevator surfing, also known as lift surfing, is the usually clandestine activity of riding on top of elevators, rather than inside them. More experienced surfers may attempt riskier maneuvers such as jumping between moving elevators, or riding the elevator&#x27;s counterweight. Elevator surfing is typically considered a form of urban exploration, aligned more with investigative experiences like rooftopping and tunnel hacking than with adventurous urban sports like train surfing. While elevator surfing was most prominent as a subculture in the United States and United Kingdom in the 1990s, it made a comeback in the late 2010s, with partakers often posting footage of their adventures on YouTube and similar platforms.

Access into the elevator shaft (Hoistway) is often achieved using an elevator key—like those carried by first responders and building maintenance staff—to open the outer doors. Alternatively, participants may utilize lock picking techniques or use tools like coat hangers and metallic bars to force the elevator car&#x27;s door interlock open between floors and unlatch the outer doors from the inside. Elevator surfers usually cannot use the emergency hatch in the roof of the elevator to access the shaft, as these are designed for first responder use and cannot be opened from the inside. 

Elevator surfing typically occurs in skyscrapers or on college campuses, especially those with tall buildings. Participation is often illegal, and if caught, surfers may face other charges like trespassing.

==Origins==
Although the first instances of elevator surfing are unknown, by 1990, the activity was noted for its popularity among children in New York City public housing projects. Children as young as six partook in the activity, often as a game of chicken. During the same time period, elevator surfing became popular on college campuses, especially along the East Coast.

==Hazards==
Elevator surfers can be electrocuted, crushed between the elevator and the sides of the elevator shaft, be struck by the counterweight, or slip and fall to their deaths.

==Injuries and deaths==
In November 1989, twelve-year-old Walter McMillan of Harlem, New York City, was found dead on top of an elevator car in a local housing complex where he had been playing; his legs had been crushed between the car and a beam, resulting in his death. Walter had been a member of the &quot;Little Tough Guys&quot;, a group of roughly thirty-five children known for elevator surfing, and police had tried to warn him of the dangers of the activity.

Also in November 1989, thirteen-year-old Paul Curley was found dead after he became entangled in the machinery after surfing the lifts at Divis Tower, Belfast.

In March 1990, University of Massachusetts Amherst student Joel Mangion was found dead in the bottom of an elevator shaft at his dormitory. Friends reported that he had been jumping from one car to another in the double shaft. While attempting the jump, he slipped and became wedged between the cab and the wall, falling sixteen stories to his death.

In March 1991, twenty-three-year-old Indiana State University aviation student Michael Deliduka and his peers used a coat hanger to wedge open elevator doors after a night of drinking. They gained access to the tops of the elevators and subsequently attempted to move between them. While Deliduka was attempting to fix a stuck elevator, it activated, pinning him between the carriage and another elevator part and killing him instantly.

In September 1992, Southern Methodist University student and athlete Michael Schlosser slipped while hanging onto the bottom of an elevator, falling thirty feet through the shaft and succumbing to blunt force head injuries. His companion also fell the same distance but only sustained a broken arm. The event prompted SMU to install safety locks on elevator doors so that they could not be pried open with hangers or other tools and would instead only open when an elevator is present.

In May 1997, ten-year-old Paul Illingworth was discovered dead at the bottom of an elevator shaft in his Leeds housing estate. He had been riding on the top of the elevator and fell eight floors to his death. 

In April 1999, fourteen-year-old Jason Nolan of Dublin died after becoming trapped between the elevator walls and mechanism at the top of the shaft in the elevator at his apartment complex. Another resident who had been in the elevator at the time of the accident reported a sudden shaking followed by a halt and heard Nolan&#x27;s friends screaming and a breathing sound that subsequently stopped.

In December 2006, eighteen-year-old Jonathan Figueroa was found dead at the bottom of an elevator shaft in a Bedford Stuyvesant apartment complex. He was likely in the shaft for two to three days.

<text>Riki Anne Wilchins (born 1952) is an American activist whose work has primarily focused on the impact of gender norms.

== Background ==
Wilchins founded the first national transgender advocacy group (GenderPAC). Their analysis and work broadened over time to include discrimination and violence regardless of individuals&#x27; identity. While this perspective has been widely accepted, its breadth has provoked criticism by some in the transgender community. Wilchins&#x27;s work and writing have often focused on youth, whom they not only see as uniquely vulnerable to the gender system&#x27;s pressures and harm, but whom they see as capable of &quot;looking with fresh eyes&quot;. Wilchins&#x27;s work has been instrumental in bringing transgender rights into the mainstream LGBT movement, and has helped bring awareness of the impact of gender norms to a wider audience, and they are credited with coining the term &quot;genderqueer.&quot; Riki Wilchins is Jewish.

In 1996, they starred in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;Transexual Menace&quot;. Wilchins&#x27;s early activism with the &quot;Hermaphrodites With Attitude!&quot; protest group and intersex leader Cheryl Chase led to the founding of Intersex Awareness Day. In 2001, Wilchins&#x27;s work resulted in them being selected one of just six community activists named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine among its &quot;100 Civic Innovators for the 21st Century&quot;. In 2009, Wilchins debuted The MANGina Monologues (A One Trans Show) at DC&#x27;s Busboys &amp; Poets, one of the first transgender standup shows. A founding member of Camp Trans, since the mid-1990s Wilchins has been highly active in founding a number of organizations and events focused on gender issues, including:

* The Menace, the first large direct action group for transgender rights, which was modeled along the lines of Queer Nation and which at one point boasted representatives in 40+ cities (co-founder Denise Norris).
* a 1996 demonstration held with members of Intersex Society of North America, now marked as Intersex Awareness Day.
* NYC Gay Community Center Gender Identity Project (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).
* NYC Gay Community Center Transgender Health Empowerment Conference, an annual event (co-founder Dr. Barbara Warren, Dir. of Social Services).
* Camp Trans, an annual educational event outside the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival that contested the exclusion of anyone who was not deemed a &quot;womyn-born womyn&quot; (co-founders Janice Walworth, Nancy Jean Burkholder).
* National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (co-founder Susan Wright, its first Exec. Dir.)
* National Gender Lobby Day, an annual event on Capitol Hill (co-founder Phyllis Frye).

== GenderPAC ==
In 1995, Wilchins founded the Gender Public Advocacy Coalition (GenderPAC), a tax-exempt organization focused on gender rights issues. GenderPAC originally focused on the transgender community, but gradually broadened its focus to include anyone who suffered discrimination or violence because of their gender identity or gender expression. GenderPAC described its mission as the creation of &quot;classrooms, communities, and workplaces [that] are safe for everyone to learn, grow, and succeed — whether or not they meet expectations for masculinity and femininity.&quot; In late 1999, the organization was incorporated and received tax-exempt status. In 2009, it rebranded and relaunched as a new organization, TrueChild, effectively ceasing operations as GenderPAC.

While GenderPAC&#x27;s Executive Director, Wilchins helped dozens of corporations as diverse as IBM, JP Morgan Chase, and Citigroup, as well as major funders like the Arcus and Gill Foundations to expand employment non-discrimination policies to include gender identity and gender expression. GenderPAC&#x27;s Congressional Non-Discrimination Pledge eventually had almost 200 sponsors, including both Republicans and US Senators. They helped compile and publish the GENIUS (Gender Equality National Index for Universities &amp; Schools) Index, which rated and ranked schools&#x27; adoption of gender identity protections. During their watch, GenderPAC also launched the GenderYOUTH Network, which eventually supported student groups at 100+ schools in creating safer and friendlier environments for those who were gender non-conforming on their own campuses.

== 1st National Survey of TransViolence ==
In 1995, with help from researcher Emilia Lombardi, GenderPAC compiled and published the &quot;1st National Survey of TransViolence&quot;, based on surveys provided by more than 500 respondents.

In 2006, in partnership with Global Rights, GenderPAC researched and published &quot;50 Under 30: Masculinity &amp; the War on America&#x27;s Youth&quot;, the first human rights report to document an under-reported tide of violence that had claimed the lives of more than 50 young people aged 30 and under attacked because of their gender identity or gender expression from 1994 to 2004. With a fresh round of attacks, the report was reissued just two years later as &quot;70 Under 30&quot;. More than 80 groups endorsed the reports&#x27; recommendations, including the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, National Organization for Women (NOW), National Council of La Raza (NCLR), Interfaith Alliance, and the Human Rights Campaign. The report was used by the House Sub-Committee which marked up the Matthew Shepard Hate Crime Act (the final bill included gender identity as a protected category and was eventually passed and signed into law).

Wilchins received their bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cleveland State University in 1982 and a masters in clinical psychology from the New School for Social Research in 1983. Wilchins then founded Data Tree Inc., a computer consulting company specializing in banking and brokerage on Wall Street. Wilchins is an out transsexual lesbian feminist. In a 2017 article published in The Advocate, Wilchins said their pronouns were they/them/theirs.

<doc id="1164721" wikidata="Q7374230" url="?curid=1164721" title="Royal Grammar School, Guildford">
<text>The Royal Grammar School, Guildford (originally &#x27;The Free School&#x27;), also known as the RGS, is a private selective day school for boys in Guildford, Surrey in England. The school dates its founding to the death of Robert Beckingham in 1509 who left provision in his will to &#x27;make a free scole at the Towne of Guldford&#x27;; in 1512 a governing body was set up to form the school. The school moved to the present site in the upper High Street after the granting of a royal charter from Edward VI in 1552. Around that time, its pupils were playing cricket and their activity was later documented as the earliest definite reference to the sport. The school&#x27;s Old Building, constructed between 1557 and 1586, is the home of a rare example of a chained library. It was established on the death of John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich, in 1575. Although defined as a &#x27;free&#x27; school, the first statutes of governance, approved in 1608, saw the introduction of school fees, at the rate of 4 shillings per annum, along with the school&#x27;s first admissions test. During the late 19th century the school ran into financial difficulty, which nearly resulted in its closure. A number of rescue options were explored, including amalgamation with Archbishop Abbott&#x27;s School. Funds were eventually raised, however, which allowed the school to remain open, although boarding was no longer offered.

Fee paying continued until the school adopted voluntary controlled status under the Education Act 1944; thereafter tuition was free and the common entrance examination at 11 was introduced. Soon after, in 1958, the school expanded with the construction of the New Building in the grounds of Allen House, a building used for a number of years as a boarding house and later as classrooms. Allen House was later demolished in 1964 just after the completion of the New Building. During December 1962 the historic Old Building caught fire, damaging a large part of it, including the two oldest rooms in the school. The damage was so great the reconstruction took over two years. The school became independent and fee paying in 1977, when the parents and staff raised sufficient funds to purchase the school following concerns about the abolition of grammar school status with the introduction of comprehensive education.

The school initially educated 30 of the &#x27;poorest men&#x27;s sons&#x27;, though has since grown to have approximately 900 students, about 300 of whom are in the sixth form. The majority of pupils, approximately two thirds, enter at age 11 in the first form, a few (3–5 pupils) enter in the second form at the age of 12, with the remainder entering at 13 in the third form. Admissions are based on an entrance examination set by the school, and an interview. The school partakes in a number of sporting activities, and has enjoyed some success, including finishing within the top two in the Daily Mail Cup twice. The school maintains a grammar school ethos, and as such runs a number of outreach programmes for students from local maintained schools, for which it won the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community/ Public Benefit Initiative. The Headmaster is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

== History ==

The founding of the school dates to 1509 and the death of Robert Beckingham, a wealthy grocer, a member of the Worshipful Company of Grocers and a Freeman of the City of London. In his will he requested that the parishioners of St Olave&#x27;s Church, Southwark, should obtain a licence to endow a chantry priest to say masses for his soul. If they failed to do this within two years of his death, his executors had discretion either to use the property to &#x27;make a free scole at the Towne of Guldford&#x27; or to put the income to some other good charitable use. The licence was not obtained within the required time, and so in 1512, Beckingham&#x27;s executors formally conveyed the lands in the bequest to a body of trustees consisting of the Mayor of Guildford and four &#x27;sad and discrete men&#x27; who had formerly been mayors. With the rents, they were to provide a free grammar school in Guildford with a &#x27;sufficient schoolmaster&#x27;, to teach thirty &quot;of the poorest-men&#x27;s sons&quot; to read and write English and cast accounts perfectly, so that they would be fit to become apprentices. The school was built in 1520 in Castle Ditch (now Castle Street) with financial assistance from Guildford municipal corporation.

Over the coming years the school ran into financial difficulty and so &quot;The Mayor and Approved Men&quot; of Guildford petitioned Edward VI to grant them further endowments for maintenance. One of the King&#x27;s closest advisers, William Parr, had a particular affection for the town, having himself spent a large amount of time at the King&#x27;s manor house in Guildford, and it was he who advised the King to re-appropriate some of the funds arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts to the school. Thus in January 1552 Edward VI ordered that there was to be &quot;one Grammar School in Guildford called the Free Grammar School of King Edward VI for the education, institution and instruction of boys and youths in Grammar at all future times forever to endure&quot;, along with a grant of 20 pounds per year; the school acquired therewith the right to style itself a Royal Grammar School. The high street site was purchased in 1555 with the construction of the Grade I listed Tudor Old Building starting in 1557. Construction was completed in 1586.

In the years around 1550, a pupil at the school was John Derrick who in later life became a Queen&#x27;s Coroner for the county of Surrey. In 1597, Derrick made a legal deposition that contains the earliest definite reference to cricket being played anywhere in the world. This is preserved in the &quot;Constitution Book&quot; of Guildford. In January 1597 (Old Style – 1598 New Style), he bore written testimony as to a parcel of land in the parish of Holy Trinity Church, Guildford which, originally waste, had been appropriated and enclosed by one John Parvish to serve as a timber yard. This land, said Derrick, he had known for fifty years past and:

&quot;Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford, hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies&quot;.

John Derrick was then aged 59 and his testimony confirms that cricket was being played by children in Surrey c.1550 and it is perhaps significant that cricket is the only one of the &quot;plaies&quot; referred to by name. Derrick was a coroner and so it must be assumed his deposition was accurate.

The death of John Parkhurst, the Bishop of Norwich, in 1575 resulted in the founding of the school&#x27;s chained library. In his will he gave &quot;the most parte of all my Latten bookes whereof shall be made a catalogue as shortelie as I may God sendinge me lief&quot;, although obtaining these books was not without its difficulties. Initially the executors of his will used &quot;all the cullerable shifts and practices&quot; to prevent the books from moving to the school. These continued to such an extent that the mayor was forced to complain to the Lord High Treasurer, William Cecil, who summoned the executors to London. Upon a hearing with the executors, the Lord Treasurer referred them to Sir Walter Mildmay who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time. He demanded that the executors give everything left in the Will to the school. Following the ruling, however, the books passed to Edmund Freke, the new Bishop of Norwich, who kept them for himself at his residence. This continued until the school obtained letters from Her Majesty&#x27;s Privy Council requiring the books be delivered. The books then finally arrived at the school several years late, although the Bishop kept a number of the best for himself. Since this date the library has been added to, most notably between 1600 and 1800. The library is housed within the Gallery (now the Headmaster&#x27;s Study) in the Old Building, with the present bookcases dating from 1897. The oldest book within the library was printed in Venice around 1480, with the oldest English book printed in about 1500 bearing the imprint of Wynkyn de Worde. Today the library is one of the few remaining examples of a chained library located within a school.

After the granting of the charter, it took 50 years before the first set of statutes to govern the school were completed. The Bishop of Winchester approved the statutes on 16 September 1608, and they constituted a major change in the way the school was run. Until this point the boys were instructed in English and accounting, but following the statutes lessons were in the subjects of Latin and Greek; with students required to speak in Latin unless licensed by the master to do otherwise. Admissions following the charter also changed, with &quot;none to be admitted scholar into the said school before he be brought to the schoolmaster of that school, and upon his examination shall be found to have learned the rudiments of grammar, called the Accidence.&quot; All scholars from the town of Guildford were required to pay the master 5 shillings on admission to the school, and for those from outside the town the charge was 10s. The number of pupils at the school was capped at 100, although this number was rarely reached. The statues also saw the introduction of school fees. Although defined as a &quot;free&quot; school, fees were still charged at the rate of 4s. per annum, paid as 9d. per quarter for the provision of &quot;rods and brooms&quot;, with an additional shilling due on the feast of St. Michael, which was used to pay for &quot;clean, wax candles&quot;.

On the death of Joseph Nettles (an old boy of the school) in 1691 the school&#x27;s first university scholarship was founded. Nettles left eleven acres of land in his will to his daughter Elizabeth Brindley, then following her death to Sir Richard Onslow and his heirs, with the rents from the land to be paid to the school for the maintenance of a scholar at Oxford or Cambridge. The scholar was to be a son of a freeman of the town of Guildford who &quot;should have read some Greek author&quot; and &quot;be well instructed and knowing in the Latin tongue&quot;. His fitness in these fields was tested by the master of the school, and the rectors of the parishes of Stoke next Guildford and St. Nicholas in Guildford. If admitted to any college within the universities, he would then receive the rents from the lands for six years. At the end of six years, upon the scholar&#x27;s death, or his removal from the university (whichever the sooner), another scholar was selected. If no scholar was deemed suitable and a vacancy arose, then the next scholar selected would receive the standard yearly rate, along with any rents acquired during the vacancy. The rents arising from the lands were roughly £23 per year. The scholarship ceased to be awarded at some point after 1951.

In 1866 the then headmaster Revd Henry G Merriman (headmaster 1859–75) purchased Allen House, a large house set in extensive grounds which stood opposite the school. The house took its name from Anthony Allen, Master of Chancery and Mayor of Guildford in 1740. This was initially used as a boarding house for the school between 1866 and 1874 before later being purchased by Surrey County Council in 1921 and was used by the school until its demolition in 1964. The grounds surrounding the house were purchased in 1914 by HA Powell and donated to the school as playing fields.

During the mid to late 19th century the school fell into disrepair and decay. Guildford Municipal Charities established a committee to report into the general condition of the school and the buildings. The committee reported in 1881 that the school had no funds available for repairs and that there were only nine boys &quot;instead of the former ordinary number of 100&quot;. Various suggestions were made by the Charity Commission to raise funds for the school, including a reorganisation with Archbishop Abbot&#x27;s School. The Committee for Maintaining Higher Education in Guildford was established in March 1887 to oppose the Charity Commission&#x27;s draft scheme to amalgamate the RGS, Nettle&#x27;s Charity and Archbishop Abbot&#x27;s School. The committee raised (approximately £108,000 in 2010) towards the restoration of the RGS, ensuring its survival. A new Charity Commission scheme came into effect in November 1888 which resulted in the Old Building being restored, and the school&#x27;s continuation as a day only school. Several years later under the Education Act 1944 the school adopted voluntary controlled status; tuition was therefore free and entrance was to be by common examination at the age of eleven.

The construction of the New Building started in 1958 in the grounds of Allen House and initially consisted of a gymnasium, assembly hall, dining hall and kitchens, caretaker&#x27;s flat, staff common rooms, junior library, cloakrooms and changing rooms, eight classrooms, science lecture theatre, five science laboratories, geography and art rooms, and various offices, stores and smaller rooms arranged in a J shape. The construction of the initial building was finished in 1963.

On the morning of , a fire broke out in the Old Building. It caused widespread damage to a large part of the structure, including the two oldest rooms in the school, School Room and Big School. The main concern was to prevent the books contained within the chained library from being damaged, either by fire or water from the fire brigade&#x27;s hoses. The damage to the building was so great that rebuilding took over 2 years, with the unusually cold winter of 1962–1963 delaying the restoration. Lessons, however, continued throughout on the Allen House side of the high street.

The school became independent in 1977 when the parents and staff of the school, led by the Chairman of the Governors, John Fergrieve Brown, raised sufficient funds to purchase the school. The RGS then withdrew from the government maintained system, becoming independent and fee paying. This was followed in 1978 by the purchase of Lanesborough Preparatory School which became the junior school, preparing boys for entry to the RGS at either 11 or 13.

More recently in 2003 construction finished on a new Sports Centre with Fitness Suite and All Weather Training Area with Shooting Range. Followed in 2006 with refurbishments to the Old Building site; the old gymnasium was converted into a Sixth Form Centre and the Victorian science laboratories (some of the earliest in the country) converted into the Art School.

In 2009/2010 the school celebrated the quincentennial anniversary of the founding of the school by Robert Beckingham; numerous events were organised, including a new musical work based loosely on the school hymn &quot;To be a Pilgrim&quot;. This year also saw a visit from Princess Anne, The Princess Royal.

RGS Guildford is due to open a campus in Doha, Qatar as part of Qatar&#x27;s Outstanding Schools Program. RGS Guildford in Qatar will open initially to boys and girls ages three to seven years old (pre-school to year 2) in September, with the rest of the primary school slated to open in 2017. According to Bob Ukaih the school aims to open two separate single-sex secondary schools – one for girls and one for boys – in Doha by September 2018.

Following the announcement of the formation of a partner school in Qatar, the school came under fire from current and former pupils, as well as concerned members of the public, due to the country&#x27;s poor human rights record. An online petition was started by a former pupil in April 2016 challenging the decision to open the school, however, this proved unsuccessful and &quot;The Royal Grammar School Guildford in Qatar&quot; (RGSGQ) opened for pupils on 19 September 2016. The school was also criticised for claiming to be an inclusive environment for all students, regardless of sexual orientation, while opening partner schools in countries where men involved in same-sex activities face the death penalty. The controversy spread when articles in the Times, the Daily Mail and the Guardian claimed that RGS had removed its policies on homophobic bullying from the rules in RGS Qatar. A spokesperson from RGS said the school had to abide by the rules of the country in which it operates, but many pupils, staff and members of the public have voiced their concern online.

October 2016 saw the opening of the John Brown building which was built replacing Trevone House for the Classics, Economics, History and Politics departments as well as for Design Technology. The building incorporates modern ecological design with a roof terrace and glass bridge connecting it to the first floor of the Main Building.

Lanesborough School merged with the Royal Grammar School, with the former becoming RGS Prep, in 2021. In 2023 the school was the site of an industrial dispute over plans to withdraw from the Teacher&#x27;s Pension Scheme.

In 2023 school teachers chose to strike, not attending lessons, in response to proposed moves to force lower-yielding pension options, or be subject to &#x27;fire and rehire&#x27; plans.

== School life ==

=== Terms ===
As in most schools in the UK there are three terms in the academic year:
* The &quot;Michaelmas Term&quot; from early September to mid-December. This is the normal term for new boys to be admitted into the school
* The &quot;Lent Term&quot; from early January to a time a week or two before Easter falls that year
* The &quot;Trinity Term&quot; from mid-late April to early July, during which time boys sit most public exams

=== House system ===
There are six houses at the RGS, named after various benefactors of the school:

Each pupil is assigned to one of the six houses upon joining the school, and a pupil&#x27;s house can be indicated to others by optional house-coloured ties. Any subsequent direct family members are put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then at the end of the year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Hardy Cup.

The Hardy Cup used to be called the Cock House Cup, the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup, but it was renamed by 16 June 2022. The Senior Housemaster (Karim Tayar) believed the concept of having a &#x27;cock of the school&#x27; was contradictory to RGS&#x27;s ethos of respect, teamwork, and fun. The name &#x27;Hardy&#x27; comes from the donors of the original trophy used, Bertrand and Stanley Hardy.

The school&#x27;s official livery colour is green, picked as a house-neutral colour.

=== School uniform ===
The school&#x27;s uniform up to the end of Fifth Form is a white shirt, grey trousers and a blazer. A grey or dark blue, v-neck pullover with or without sleeves may also be worn. For the lower and upper sixth, navy blue or grey suits are instead worn, and upper sixth formers are permitted to wear pastel shaded shirts. A woollen scarf in the school colours: green, red and white; the sixth form scarf has longitudinal stripes. All years are required to wear one of the approved school ties. Various ties are awarded for sporting, artistic or social achievements, along with half and full colours awarded for services to the school and house colours awarded for services to the house; Senior Prefect ties are awarded to those with the position. Recently there have also been commemorative ties celebrating 450 years since the granting of the Royal Charter, and 500 years since the founding of the school.

=== Sport ===
Sport is compulsory for all years during games periods and if selected for a team can require compulsory attendance on Saturdays.
* In the Michaelmas term rugby union is the main sport, hockey is also played.
* In the Lent term hockey is the main sport, rugby sevens is also played
* In the Trinity term cricket is the main sport, athletics is an option.
The sports of badminton, cross country running, fencing, football, golf, judo, rowing, sailing, swimming, target shooting and tennis are available, the list varies by year and term. Sixth form also have a &quot;Spectrum&quot; games option where boys are permitted to use any of the facilities at Guildford Spectrum during the games period.

The school has enjoyed some success in rugby where it has had first and second places at various levels of the Daily Mail Cup.

On 6 February 2016, Old Guildfordian Jack Clifford became a full England rugby international when he made his full debut as a replacement for Chris Robshaw during the Calcutta Cup match after 69 minutes.

Since 2003 the six Royal Grammar Schools (Colchester, High Wycombe, Guildford, Lancaster, Newcastle, Worcester) have held the &quot;RGS Cricket Festival&quot;, hosted by a different school each year. It is based on a round robin format and held over a period of five days towards the end of the Trinity term.

The school has no playing fields on the town centre site. A ground called Bradstone Brook, located a few miles away in the village of Chilworth, is the location of the rugby and cricket pitches. There is a single AstroTurf located at the main school for hockey and football. The majority of hockey takes place at Guildford Hockey Club, located at Broadwater School in Farncombe or Surrey Sports Park. Athletics and swimming both take place at Guildford Spectrum.

=== Extra-curricular activities ===
Music
Music is part of the core curriculum for first to third forms. Pupils take lessons with peripatetic music staff within different disciplines. There is a symphony orchestra composed of students, along with several other smaller classical ensembles. The RGS choir perform regularly in Guildford Cathedral, and have in the past performed at The Royal Albert Hall. In addition to classical music, there are also a number of jazz and rock bands within the school as well, and to recognise this in addition to the four main music prizes awarded each year, there is an additional contemporary music prize.

Drama
Drama is offered as an academic subject from the first form. Plays are staged for all year groups in association with local girls schools. The department has an auditorium which was converted from the old gymnasium as well as the Hansford Room studio sited in the North Building.

Period 8
Period 8 is for extra-curricular activities which include Combined Cadet Force, outdoor pursuits, Scouts, lifesaving and community service. There are five field days in the year, on which these activities take place. Before the third form, pupils have the opportunity to decide between the CCF, outdoor pursuits and the scouts. The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award scheme is &#x27;Hors Combat&#x27; for choice, being available to all students, regardless of their other options, so no longer officially constitutes part of period 8.

Clubs and societies
There are several dozen clubs and societies at the school, many of these are where pupils get together to discuss a topic of particular interest sometimes with a guest speaker.

Publications
&quot;The Register&quot; (originally &quot;Really Good Stuff&quot;) is a termly newsletter documenting achievements at the school.

== Admission and fees ==
Initially tuition at the school was free, funded by various endowments and rents obtained from lands the most significant arising from the Abolition of the Chantries Acts, and the re-appropriation of funds to the school. In 1944 under the Education Act education remained free, however the common entrance exam at eleven was introduced and the school became a selective grammar school. School fees were introduced in 1977 when the school withdrew from the maintained system and became independent. For the year 2013/2014 they are £14,670 (approximately €17,900 or US$24,500 as of March 2014) per year excluding lunches. All those wishing to be admitted now take the school&#x27;s own internal 11+ entrance examination which tests English, mathematics and verbal reasoning and attend an interview with two members of staff. If a place is awarded, entry can be deferred for two years so that boys who are at prep school may enter at thirteen. Those entering at thirteen must take the 13+ Common Entrance or the scholarship examination to confirm their place.

Numerous scholarships are available at both 11+ and 13+ for music, academic achievement, and one for art at thirteen. Music and academic scholarships range in value between 5%–10% with one Kings Scholarship available for a 10% reduction in fees. These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances, and an interview for academic or music scholarships, or the presentation of a portfolio of work for the art scholarship. Until the start of the 2009/2010 academic year, the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King&#x27;s Scholarships worth 50% of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10 and 30%.

== Charitable status and public benefit ==
The school is a registered charity and currently has three charities registered with the Charities Commission: &quot;King Edward VI&#x27;s Grammar School (The Royal Grammar School), Guildford&quot;, &quot;The Royal Grammar School Guildford&quot; (representing the governors), and &quot;The Royal Grammar School Guildford Foundation&quot; After the withdrawal of the Assisted Places Scheme in 1997 the social diversity of the school decreased, as a result the school began to offer bursaries to students whose parents could not afford the fees, with the first bursary offered in 2007.

The school also runs numerous outreach programmes for children from maintained schools in the local area, including a series of master-classes in science, mathematics, technology, languages and drama for local primary school children. Also for primary school children is the Tudor Experience Project where students can explore the Tudor past of the school through a number of activities. At the higher end of the school, numerous careers and university seminars are run for sixth form students from the local area, in addition to Oxbridge preparation classes and practice interviews for local sixth form students. The school also runs several more outreach programmes, and as a result of these initiatives was recently awarded the Independent School Award 2010 for Outstanding Community/Public Benefit Initiative.

== Headmasters ==
The post of headmaster (schoolmaster or just master as it was originally known) was created following the grant of the Royal Charter in 1552, with the first appointment made in 1554. There have been 35 appointments since the creation of the position. Until the re-organisation of the school in 1888 the post was almost exclusively filled by men from a religious background, with the first headmaster being Sir Lawson, a friar from the monastery in Guildford that was dissolved in 1538. The most notable headmaster was Roger Goad (1569–1575), who was Provost of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and three times Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge; he was headmaster during the time when George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury 1611–1633) was at the school. The current headmaster is Jon Cox.

<text>An injector is a system of ducting and nozzles used to direct the flow of a high-pressure fluid in such a way that a lower pressure fluid is entrained in the jet and carried through a duct to a region of higher pressure. It is a fluid-dynamic pump with no moving parts except a valve to control inlet flow.

Depending on the application, an injector can also take the form of an &quot;eductor-jet pump&quot;, a &quot;water eductor&quot; or an &quot;aspirator&quot;. An &quot;ejector&quot; operates on similar principles to create a vacuum feed connection for braking systems etc.

The motive fluid may be a liquid, steam or any other gas. The entrained suction fluid may be a gas, a liquid, a slurry, or a dust-laden gas stream.

== Steam injector ==
The steam injector is a common device used for delivering water to steam boilers, especially in steam locomotives. It is a typical application of the injector principle used to deliver cold water to a boiler against its own pressure, using its own live or exhaust steam, replacing any mechanical pump. When first developed, its operation was intriguing because it seemed paradoxical, almost like perpetual motion, but it was later explained using thermodynamics. Other types of injector may use other pressurised motive fluids such as air.

==History==
===Giffard===
The injector was invented by Henri Giffard in early 1850s and patented in France in 1858, for use on steam locomotives. It was patented in the United Kingdom by Sharp, Stewart and Company of Glasgow.

After some initial scepticism resulting from the unfamiliar and superficially paradoxical mode of operation, the injector became widely adopted for steam locomotives as an alternative to mechanical pumps.

===Kneass===
Strickland Landis Kneass was a civil engineer, experimenter, and author, with many accomplishments involving railroading. Kneass began publishing a mathematical model of the physics of the injector, which he had verified by experimenting with steam. A steam injector has three primary sections:

*Steam nozzle, a diverging duct, which converts high pressure steam to low pressure, high velocity wet steam
*Combining tube, a converging duct, which mixes high velocity steam and cold water
*Delivery tube, a diverging duct, where a high velocity stream of steam and cold water become a slow high pressure stream of water

====Nozzle====

Figure 15 shows four sketches Kneass drew of steam passing through a nozzle. In general, compressible flows through a diverging duct increases velocity as a gas expands. The two sketches at the bottom of figure 15 are both diverging, but the bottom one is slightly curved, and produced the highest velocity flow parallel to the axis. The area of a duct is proportional to the square of the diameter, and the curvature allows the steam to expand more linearly as it passes through the duct.

An ideal gas cools during adiabatic expansion (without adding heat), releasing less energy than the same gas would during isothermal expansion (constant temperature). Expansion of steam follows an intermediate thermodynamic process called the Rankine cycle. Steam does more work than an ideal gas, because steam remains hot during expansion.

The extra heat comes from enthalpy of vaporization, as some of the steam condenses back into droplets of water intermixed with steam.

====Combining tube====
At the end of the nozzle, the steam has very high velocity, but at less than atmospheric pressure, drawing in cold water which becomes entrained in the stream, where the steam condenses into droplets of water in a converging duct.

====Delivery tube====
The delivery tube is a diverging duct where the force of deceleration increases pressure, allowing the stream of water to enter the boiler.

==Operation==
The injector consists of a body filled with a secondary fluid, into which a motive fluid is injected. The motive fluid induces the secondary fluid to move. Injectors exist in many variations, and can have several stages, each repeating the same basic operating principle, to increase their overall effect.

It uses the Venturi effect of a converging-diverging nozzle on a steam jet to convert the pressure energy of the steam to velocity energy, reducing its pressure to below that of the atmosphere, which enables it to entrain a fluid (e.g., water). After passing through the convergent &quot;combining cone&quot;, the mixed fluid is fully condensed. The condensate mixture then enters a divergent &quot;delivery cone&quot; which slows the jet, converting kinetic energy back into static pressure energy above the pressure of the boiler enabling its feed through a non-return valve.

Most of the heat energy in the condensed steam is returned to the boiler, increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. Injectors are therefore typically over 98% energy-efficient overall; they are also simple compared to the many moving parts in a feed pump.
===Key design parameters===
Fluid feed rate and operating pressure range are the key parameters of an injector, and vacuum pressure and evacuation rate are the key parameters for an ejector.

Compression ratio and the entrainment ratio may also be defined:

The compression ratio of the injector, formula_1, is defined as ratio of the injector&#x27;s outlet pressure formula_2 to the inlet pressure of the suction fluid formula_3.

The entrainment ratio of the injector, formula_4, is defined as the amount formula_5 (in kg/h) of suction fluid that can be entrained and compressed by a given amount formula_6 (in kg/h) of motive fluid.

===Lifting properties===
Other key properties of an injector include the fluid inlet pressure requirements i.e. whether it is lifting or non-lifting.

In a non-lifting injector, positive inlet fluid pressure is needed e.g. the cold water input is fed by gravity.

The steam-cone minimal orifice diameter is kept larger than the combining cone minimal diameter. The non-lifting Nathan 4000 injector used on the Southern Pacific 4294 could push 12,000 US gallons (45,000 L) per hour at 250 psi (17 bar).

The lifting injector can operate with negative inlet fluid pressure i.e. fluid lying below the level of the injector. It differs from the non-lifting type mainly in the relative dimensions of the nozzles.

===Overflow===
An overflow is required for excess steam or water to discharge, especially during starting. If the injector cannot initially overcome boiler pressure, the overflow allows the injector to continue to draw water and steam.

===Check valve===
There is at least one check valve (called a &quot;clack valve&quot; in locomotives because of the distinctive noise it makes) between the exit of the injector and the boiler to prevent back flow, and usually a valve to prevent air being sucked in at the overflow.

===Exhaust steam injector===
Efficiency was further improved by the development of a multi-stage injector which is powered not by live steam from the boiler but by exhaust steam from the cylinders, thereby making use of the residual energy in the exhaust steam which would otherwise go to waste. However, an exhaust injector also cannot work when the locomotive is stationary; later exhaust injectors could use a supply of live steam if no exhaust steam was available.

===Problems===
Injectors can be troublesome under certain running conditions, such as when vibration causes the combined steam and water jet to &quot;knock off&quot;. Originally the injector had to be restarted by careful manipulation of the steam and water controls, and the distraction caused by a malfunctioning injector was largely responsible for the 1913 Ais Gill rail accident. Later injectors were designed to automatically restart on sensing the collapse in vacuum from the steam jet, for example with a spring-loaded delivery cone.

Another common problem occurs when the incoming water is too warm and is less effective at condensing the steam in the combining cone. That can also occur if the metal body of the injector is too hot, e.g. from prolonged use.

The internal parts of an injector are subject to erosive wear, particularly damage at the throat of the delivery cone which may be due to cavitation.

===Vacuum ejectors===
An additional use for the injector technology is in vacuum ejectors in continuous train braking systems, which were made compulsory in the UK by the Regulation of Railways Act 1889. A vacuum ejector uses steam pressure to draw air out of the vacuum pipe and reservoirs of continuous train brake. Steam locomotives, with a ready source of steam, found ejector technology ideal with its rugged simplicity and lack of moving parts. A steam locomotive usually has two ejectors: a large ejector for releasing the brakes when stationary and a small ejector for maintaining the vacuum against leaks. The exhaust from the ejectors is invariably directed to the smokebox, by which means it assists the blower in draughting the fire. The small ejector is sometimes replaced by a reciprocating pump driven from the crosshead because this is more economical of steam and is only required to operate when the train is moving.

Vacuum brakes have been superseded by air brakes in modern trains, which allow the use of smaller brake cylinders and/or higher braking force due to the greater difference from atmospheric pressure.

===Earlier application of the principle===

An empirical application of the principle was in widespread use on steam locomotives before its formal development as the injector, in the form of the arrangement of the blastpipe and chimney in the locomotive smokebox. The sketch on the right shows a cross section through a smokebox, rotated 90 degrees; it can be seen that the same components are present, albeit differently named, as in the generic diagram of an injector at the top of the article. Exhaust steam from the cylinders is directed through a nozzle on the end of the blastpipe, to reduce pressure inside the smokebox by entraining the flue gases from the boiler which are then ejected via the chimney. The effect is to increase the draught on the fire to a degree proportional to the rate of steam consumption, so that as more steam is used, more heat is generated from the fire and steam production is also increased. The effect was first noted by Richard Trevithick and subsequently developed empirically by the early locomotive engineers; Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket made use of it, and this constitutes much of the reason for its notably improved performance in comparison with contemporary machines.

==Modern uses==

The use of injectors (or ejectors) in various industrial applications has become quite common due to their relative simplicity and adaptability. For example:

* To inject chemicals into the boiler drums of small, stationary, low pressure boilers. In large, high-pressure modern boilers, usage of injectors for chemical dosing is not possible due to their limited outlet pressures.
* In thermal power stations, they are used for the removal of the boiler bottom ash, the removal of fly ash from the hoppers of the electrostatic precipitators used to remove that ash from the boiler flue gas, and for drawing a vacuum pressure in steam turbine exhaust condensers.
* Jet pumps have been used in boiling water nuclear reactors to circulate the coolant fluid.
* For use in producing a vacuum pressure in steam jet cooling systems.
* For expansion work recovery in air conditioning and refrigeration systems.
* For enhanced oil recovery processes in the oil &amp; gas Industry.
* For the bulk handling of grains or other granular or powdered materials.
* The construction industry uses them for pumping turbid water and slurries.
* Eductors are used in ships to pump residual ballast water, or cargo oil which cannot be removed using centrifugal pumps due to loss of suction head and may damage the centrifugal pump if run dry, which may be caused due to trim or list of the ship.
* Eductors are used on-board ships to pump out bilges, since using centrifugal pump would not be feasible as the suction head may be lost frequently.
* Some aircraft (mostly earlier designs) use an ejector attached to the fuselage to provide vacuum for gyroscopic instruments such as an attitude indicator (artificial horizon).
* Eductors are used in aircraft fuel systems as transfer pumps; fluid flow from an engine-mounted mechanical pump can be delivered to a fuel tank-mounted eductor to transfer fuel from that tank.
* Aspirators are vacuum pumps based on the same operating principle and are used in laboratories to create a partial vacuum and for medical use in suction of mucus or bodily fluids.
* Water eductors are water pumps used for dredging silt and panning for gold, they&#x27;re used because they can handle the highly abrasive mixtures quite well.
* To create vacuum system in vacuum distillation unit (oil refinery).
* Vacuum autoclaves use an ejector to pull a vacuum, generally powered by the cold water supply to the machine.
* Low weight jet pumps can be made out of paper mache.

==Well pumps==

Jet pumps are commonly used to extract water from water wells. The main pump, often a centrifugal pump, is powered and installed at ground level. Its discharge is split, with the greater part of the flow leaving the system, while a portion of the flow is returned to the jet pump installed below ground in the well. This recirculated part of the pumped fluid is used to power the jet. At the jet pump, the high-energy, low-mass returned flow drives more fluid from the well, becoming a low-energy, high-mass flow which is then piped to the inlet of the main pump.

Shallow well pumps are those in which the jet assembly is attached directly to the main pump and are limited to a depth of approximately 5-8m to prevent cavitation.

Deep well pumps are those in which the jet is located at the bottom of the well. The maximum depth for deep well pumps is determined by the inside diameter of and the velocity through the jet. The major advantage of jet pumps for deep well installations is the ability to situate all mechanical parts (e.g., electric/petrol motor, rotating impellers) at the ground surface for easy maintenance. The advent of the electrical submersible pump has partly replaced the need for jet type well pumps, except for driven point wells or surface water intakes.

==Multi-stage steam vacuum ejectors==
In practice, for suction pressure below 100 mbar absolute, more than one ejector is used, usually with condensers between the ejector stages. Condensing of motive steam greatly improves ejector set efficiency; both barometric and shell-and-tube surface condensers are used.

In operation a two-stage system consists of a primary high-vacuum (HV) ejector and a secondary low-vacuum (LV) ejector. Initially the LV ejector is operated to pull vacuum down from the starting pressure to an intermediate pressure. Once this pressure is reached, the HV ejector is then operated in conjunction with the LV ejector to finally pull vacuum to the required pressure.

In operation a three-stage system consists of a primary booster, a secondary high-vacuum (HV) ejector, and a tertiary low-vacuum (LV) ejector. As per the two-stage system, initially the LV ejector is operated to pull vacuum down from the starting pressure to an intermediate pressure. Once this pressure is reached, the HV ejector is then operated in conjunction with the LV ejector to pull vacuum to the lower intermediate pressure. Finally the booster is operated (in conjunction with the HV &amp; LV ejectors) to pull vacuum to the required pressure.

==Construction materials==

Injectors or ejectors are made of carbon steel, stainless steel, brass, titanium, PTFE, carbon, and other materials.

<doc id="1164725" wikidata="Q1134273" url="?curid=1164725" title="Cornouaille">
<text>Cornouaille (; , ) is a historical region on the west coast of Brittany in West France. The name is cognate with Cornwall in neighbouring Great Britain. This can be explained by the settlement of Cornouaille by migrant princes from Cornwall who created an independent principality founded by Rivelen Mor Marthou, and the founding of the Bishopric of Cornouaille by ancient saints from Cornwall. Celtic Britons and the settlers in Brittany spoke a common language, which later evolved into Breton, Welsh and Cornish.

==Etymology==
The toponym Cornouaille was established in the early Middle Ages in the southwest of the Breton peninsula. Prior to this, following the withdrawal of Rome from Britain, other British migrants from what is now modern Devon had established the region of &quot;Domnonea&quot; (in Breton) or &quot;Domnonée&quot; (in French) in the north of the peninsula, taken from the Latin &quot;Dumnonia&quot;.

The region was first mentioned in surviving records by a &quot;Cornouaille&quot;-related name between 852 and 857, when Anaweten, bishop of Saint-Corentin at Quimper Cathedral, took over &quot;Cornugallensis&quot; under the order of Nominoe, Duke of Brittany and Tad ar Vro. The names Cornwall and Cornouaille, like the surname Cornwallis, are from &quot;Corn-wealas&quot;. The first element is from the name of a Brythonic tribe Latinized as &quot;Cornovii&quot;, meaning &#x27;peninsula people&#x27;, from the Celtic &quot;kernou&quot;, &#x27;horn, headland&#x27;, from PIE &quot;*ker-&quot; &#x27;uppermost part of the body, head, horn, top, summit&#x27;. The second element is the Anglo-Saxon suffix &quot;-wealas&quot;, from &quot;walh&quot;, a word used by the Germanic speakers for &#x27;a non-Germanic foreigner&#x27;, especially Celtic speakers but also sometimes used for Romance-language speakers. &quot;Walh&quot; is an element found in the words and names walnut, Walloon, Wales, Wallasey, Waleswood, Wallachia, Wallace, Walcheren, and Walsh.

A &quot;Corn-/Kern-&quot; name was used in reference to the resettling of the new wave Celts from Great Britain in formerly Dumnonian-seized lands. This is related to the difference between &quot;Grande-Bretagne&quot; (Great Britain) and &quot;Bretagne&quot; (Brittany) in French, with Brittany having originally been thought of a British colony (and the second such in the same area). In Breton, Cornouaille is known as Kernev or &quot;Bro-Gernev&quot;, and in Latin as &quot;Cornugallia&quot; or &quot;Cornubia&quot;. In Cornish, &quot;Kernev&quot; is written &quot;Kernow&quot;, but the pronunciation is the same.

==History==
Strong contacts between Armorica (a larger region than the Duchy of Brittany or modern Brittany) and southern Britain had already been noted by Julius Caesar. Native British troops were hired to support the usurpation of Magnus Maximus, who is said to have settled them in Armorica. Settlements expanded when invading Anglo-Saxons expanded westward within Britain. Strong links existed in the 6th century between the British and Armorican territories. Legends about King Arthur and the Matter of Britain make frequent reference to the maritime connections between the peoples of Wales, southern Ireland, Cornwall in southwestern Britain and the early kingdoms of Brittany, cf. the tale of Tristan and Iseult.

The existence of an ancient district in Anjou called &quot;la Cornuaille&quot; has led to the hypothesis that &quot;Cornouaille&quot; may have been a geographical or military label for all of southern Brittany as far as the northern shore of Domnonée in the 6th or 7th century.

At the origin of this feudal county, the reigning dynasty acceded to a dukedom of the region, which then passed to the Ancient Lord-Bishop of Quimper.

==Diocese==
The name &quot;Cornouaille&quot; signifies the diocese of Quimper which persisted until the French Revolution. The diocese covered more than half of the south of Finistère, and extended over part of Morbihan and the Côtes-d&#x27;Armor. There were two archdeacons, one for Cornouaille and one for Poher. There were also a cantor, a treasurer, a theologian and twelve canons. This episcopal division was the poorest in Brittany.

After the French Revolution, the new constitution created a diocese of Finistère, erasing that of the diocese of Kerne (Cournouaille); most of the old diocese was absorbed into the new.

==Traditional districts==
==List of rulers==
*Gradlon (semi-legendary)
* Rivelen Mor Marthou (c. 430)
*Congar (c. 450)
*Daniel Drem Rud (c. 500)
*Melar (c. 500s)
*Budic II (c. 545)
*Macliau (544–577)
*Judicael (circa 857–874) – the county of Cornouaille is not yet precisely defined. Its leaders represent the interests of &quot;western Brittany&quot; and join the King of Brittany in fights against the Vikings. 
* Riwallon (circa 874)
*Gourmaëlon (early 10th century)
*Alan II (early to mid-10th century)
*Alain Canhiart
*Hoel of Cornouaille, who ruled Brittany as Duke &quot;jure uxoris&quot;.
*Alan IV

<text>Governador Lindenberg is the name of a Brazilian municipality in the southeastern state of Espírito Santo. Its population was 12,880 (2020) and its area is 360 km².

As of 2001, an official flag was adopted, and the coat of arms designed by Andreia Freitas dos Santos won a school competition to choose the city&#x27;s coat of arms, in which the prize was a television.

Located in the north of the state, roughly 200km from the capital of Vitória, this municipality gained independence from Colatina on July 29, 1997. Its colonization was made primarily through the access of the Doce River, by Italian immigrants, who settled there during the 19th century.

<text>Rhodes University () is a public research university located in Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown) in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. It is one of four universities in the province. 

Established in 1904, Rhodes University is the province&#x27;s oldest university, and it is the sixth oldest South African university in continuous operation, being preceded by the University of the Free State (1904), University of Witwatersrand (1896), University of South Africa (1873) as the University of the Cape of Good Hope, Stellenbosch University (1866) and the University of Cape Town (1829). Rhodes was founded in 1904 as Rhodes University College, named after Cecil Rhodes, through a grant from the Rhodes Trust. It became a constituent college of the University of South Africa in 1918 before becoming an independent university in 1951.

The university had an enrollment of over 8,000 students in the 2015 academic year, of whom just over 3,600 lived in 51 residences on the campus, with the rest (known as &quot;Oppidans&quot;) taking residence in digs (off-campus residences) or in their own homes in the town.

== History ==

Although a proposal to found a university in Grahamstown had been made as early as 1902, financial problems caused by the Frontier Wars in Albany prevented the proposal from being implemented. In 1904 Leander Starr Jameson issued £50 000 preferred stock to the university from the Rhodes Trust. With this funding Rhodes University College was founded by an act of parliament on 31 May 1904.

University education in the Eastern Cape began in the college departments of four schools: St. Andrew&#x27;s College; Gill College, Somerset East; Graaff-Reinet College; and the Grey Institute in Port Elizabeth. The four St Andrew&#x27;s College professors, Arthur Matthews, George Cory, Stanley Kidd and G. F. Dingemans became founding professors of Rhodes University College.

At the beginning of 1905, Rhodes moved from cramped quarters at St Andrew&#x27;s to the Drostdy building, which it bought from the British Government. Rhodes became a constituent college of the new University of South Africa in 1918 and it continued to expand in size. When the future of the University of South Africa came under review in 1947, Rhodes opted to become an independent university.

Rhodes University was inaugurated on 10 March 1951. Sir Basil Schonland, son of Selmar Schonland, became the first chancellor of his alma mater, and Dr. Thomas Alty the first vice-chancellor. In terms of the Rhodes University Private Act, the University College of Fort Hare was affiliated to Rhodes University. This mutually beneficial arrangement continued until the apartheid government decided to disaffiliate Fort Hare from Rhodes. The Rhodes Senate and Council objected strongly to this, and to the Separate University Education Bill, which they condemned as interference with academic freedom. However, the two bills were passed, and Fort Hare&#x27;s affiliation to Rhodes came to an end in 1959. Nevertheless, in 1962 an honorary doctorate was conferred on the state president, C. R. Swart, who (as Minister of Justice after 1948) had been responsible for the repression of opposition political organisations. The award caused the resignation of the chancellor, Sir Basil Schonland, although his reasons were not made public at the time.

James Hyslop succeeded Alty in 1963. In 1971, Rhodes negotiated to purchase the closed teacher training college run by the sisters of the Community of the Resurrection of our Lord including the buildings and grounds and a number of adjacent buildings, facilitating further expansion.

== Campus ==

During 2008 work began on construction of a new library building at a cost of R85 million, one of the largest infrastructure projects undertaken by the university, and was completed in 2010.

== Organisation and administration ==
=== Faculties and Schools ===

Rhodes has six faculties, listed below:
* Humanities (1952)
* Commerce
* Law
* Science
* Education
* Pharmacy

The six faculties are further subdivided into 30 academic departments, of which 11 form part of the humanities faculty. The humanities faculty, being the largest in the university, consists of 40% of the student intake of undergraduate and postgraduate studies, enrolling 2669 students as of 2009.

=== Law clinic ===

Rhodes University operates a law clinic, which operates as a firm of attorneys providing training to law students and free legal services for indigent people. The law clinic operates from two offices, one in Makhanda and one in Komani. The law clinic came to national attention in July 2013 when it represented 15 members of Nelson Mandela&#x27;s family in their litigation against Mandla Mandela (Nelson Mandela&#x27;s grandson) concerning the location of family grave sites.

== Academics ==

Rhodes is a small, highly residential university. For most undergraduates, first and second years of study are done while living in campus residences.

Rhodes&#x27; academic program operates on a semester calendar, beginning in early-February to early-June, and the second semester beginning in late-July and ending late-November.

Undergraduate tuition for the first year of study in 2011 towards a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree was R26,590 and R27,720, respectively, and the cost of board was between R35,700 and R37,600.

=== Student body ===

Rhodes admitted 1592 students in 2012.

The tables below show the racial and gender composition of the university for that year.

=== SARChi chairs ===

Rhodes holds fourteen national research chairs appointed under the South African Research Chairs Initiative. This accounts for approximately 7% of the total awarded nationally in South Africa, a significant proportion given the university&#x27;s small size.

==Name controversy==
The university&#x27;s name references Cecil Rhodes, a British businessman who heavily aided British imperial interests in South Africa, which led to controversy starting in 2015. Protests held that year by Rhodes Must Fall led to the University of Cape Town removing a statue of Rhodes, and similar protests against Rhodes&#x27; legacy occurred at Rhodes University. Some students and outlets started referring to it as &quot;The University Currently Known As Rhodes&quot;. In 2015 the university council undertook to determine whether or not the institution should change its name, as well as consider several other ways it could deal with the issues.

In 2017, the Rhodes University Council voted 15–9 in favour of keeping the existing name. While the university agreed with critics that &quot;[it] cannot be disputed that Cecil John Rhodes was an arch-imperialist and white supremacist who treated people of this region as sub-human&quot;, it also said it had long since distanced itself from the person and had distinguished itself with the name Rhodes University as one of the world&#x27;s best. The main argument against the change was financial, as such a change would cost a significant amount of money and the university was already having trouble with its budget. Furthermore, changing the university&#x27;s name could have an adverse effect on its recognition internationally.

<doc id="1164741" wikidata="Q1721805" url="?curid=1164741" title="Kaituna River">
<text>The Kaituna River is in the Bay of Plenty region of the North Island of New Zealand. It is the outflow from Lakes Rotorua and Rotoiti, and flows northwards for , emptying into the Bay of Plenty at Maketu. It was the subject of a claim concerning the effluent flowing down the river from Lake Rotorua, which resulted in movement to a land treatment system.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;eat eels&quot; for &quot;Kaituna&quot;.

The upper section of the Kaituna, also referred to as Okere River, offers some of the best whitewater kayaking and rafting in the world, with the Okere Falls area containing the highest commercially rafted waterfall, , in the world. It is also famous for its trout fishing.

==Cultural claim==
During the 1970s Lake Rotorua was becoming eutrophic under heavy nutrient loadings, leading the Ministry of Works to propose diverting some sewage flow into the Kaituna River. Local iwi objected however, and filed a claim with the Waitangi Tribunal. Their objections included the insult to other iwi (leading to loss of mana) and destruction of the rivers &quot;mauri&quot; (life force or essence) which they believed would destroy its ability to sustain aquatic life. The Ministry of Works report however stated that the mauri concept was essentially religious in nature and not scientifically verifiable, while on the other hand diluting the waste would help prevent excess pollution and keep costs at a reasonable level. In Māori culture religion and science are not treated separately as they tend to be in Western culture.

In 1990 however, the Rotorua Land Treatment Scheme saw an upgrade to treatment facilities to remove 80% of nitrogen and phosphorus from the effluent, and land application to reduce eutrophication and satisfy Māori cultural wishes. This has led to better environmental, economic and cultural outcomes for all parties.

==Power generation==
The upper reaches of the Kaituna river was the site of a small power station which was in operation from 1901 to 1936, the first generating plant built by the New Zealand government. Several proposals for a larger power station have been considered, however the high cost of these projects has meant that none have been built to date.

In 2008 there was a consultation regarding the installation of a new hydro electric power dam below the river at the end of Trout Pool Road. This would involve the creation of a man made dam and the flooding of some land, destroying a section of river known as &quot;Awesome Gorge&quot; and leaving the section known as &quot;Gnarly Gorge&quot; with a highly reduced flow. Kayaking and rafting groups and local iwi raised objections. The Department of Conservation granted a concession for the project in December 2007.

==Whitewater==
The Kaituna River is a world-famous white-water destination. The river has been run regularly by rafting and kayak since 1991. It is used for recreational kayaking, commercial tandem kayaking, rafting and sledging. It is a winter destination for paddlers from the northern hemisphere. The entrance to the upper gorge contains a slalom course that has been used by international teams for their off-season training prior to world championships and Olympic competition. The upper gorge contains a number of play features, including the famous &quot;bottom hole&quot;. The entire river has been run. The temperate rainforest, warm water, and its unusual character means the river is well known in international whitewater kayak videos.

Notable waterfalls in the upper gorge are Okere Falls, Tutea Falls (the highest commercially rafted waterfall), and Trout Pool Falls, all of which are accessible via the Okere Falls track.
== Navigation ==
In 1881 snags were removed from the river to allow river boats to run between Canaan Landing, near Te Puke, and the river port at Maketu from May 1881, until Northern Steamship closed their office on 29 September 1917.

<text>Tincomarus (a dithematic name form typical of insular and continental Celtic onomastics, analysable as &quot;tinco-&quot;, perhaps a sort of fish [cf Latin &quot;tinca&quot;, English &quot;tench&quot;] + &quot;maro-&quot;, &quot;big&quot;) was a king of the Iron Age Belgic tribe of the Atrebates who lived in southern central Britain shortly before the Roman invasion. His name was previously reconstructed as Tincommius, based on abbreviated coin legends and a damaged mention in Augustus&#x27;s &quot;Res Gestae&quot;, but since 1996 coins have been discovered which give his full name.

He was the son and heir of Commius and succeeded his father around 25-20 BC. Based on coin distribution it is possible that Tincomarus ruled in collaboration with his father for the last few years of Commius&#x27;s life. Little is known of his reign although numismatic evidence suggests that he was more sympathetic to Rome than his father was in later years: the coins he issued much more closely resemble Roman types, and are made in such a way they may have come from Roman die-cutters. GC Boon has suggested that this technical advance was not limited to coinage and represents wider industrial assistance from the Roman Empire. Tincomarus&#x27;s successors used the term &quot;rex&quot; on their coins and this indicates that Tincomarus had begun the process of achieving client kingdom status with Rome (see Roman client kingdoms in Britain).

John Creighton argues, based on the imagery used on his coins, that Tincomarus may have been brought up as an &quot;obses&quot; (diplomatic hostage) in Rome in the early years of Augustus&#x27;s reign. He compares Tincomarus&#x27;s coins to those of Juba II of Numidia, who is known to have been an &quot;obses&quot;, and identifies a coin found in Numidia which may bear the name of Tincomarus&#x27;s younger brother Verica.
By 16 BC Roman pottery and other imports appear in considerable quantities at Tincomarus&#x27;s capital of Calleva Atrebatum, today known as Silchester, and it is likely that the Atrebatic king had established trading and diplomatic links with Augustus.

Tincomarus was expelled by his subjects for unknown reasons around AD 8 and fled to Rome as a refugee and supplicant. He was replaced by his brother Eppillus whom Augustus chose to recognise as &quot;rex&quot; rather than depose and reinstate Tincomarus. Augustus may have planned to use his ally&#x27;s ejection as an excuse to invade Britain but other, more pressing foreign policy matters probably persuaded him to postpone the move.

<doc id="1164751" wikidata="Q2130963" url="?curid=1164751" title="Rangitaiki River">
<text>The Rangitaiki River is the longest river in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is long, and rises inland from northern Hawkes Bay to the east of the Kaingaroa Forest.
The Rangitaiki catchment covers an area of 3005 km.
It flows in a generally northeastward direction, passing through the town of Murupara and skirting close to the western edge of Te Urewera National Park before turning northwards, flowing past Edgecumbe and into the Bay of Plenty close to Thornton.

There are two man-made lakes on the Rangitaiki formed by hydro-electric dams, Lake Āniwaniwa (formerly Lake Aniwhenua). and Lake Matahina.

== History ==
In April 2017, remnants of Cyclone Debbie caused heavy rainfall in the region. At 8:30 am on April 6, water from the Rangitaiki River breached the College Road floodwall at Edgecumbe, causing widespread flooding across the township. A state of emergency was declared for the Whakatane District, and around 2,000 people were evacuated to Kawerau and Whakatāne.
More than 300 homes were damaged, with some becoming uninhabitable.
A review of the flood was undertaken by a panel consisting of Sir Michael Cullen (chair), Kyle Christensen, and Charlie Price.

== Course ==

The river is long, rising at an elevation of above mean sea level, east of Lake Taupo and south of the Bay of Plenty coast. From its source in the Ahimanawa Ranges it flows for across the Kaingaroa Plains towards Murupara.
Near the northern edge of the plains the river has been dammed by the Rangitāiki Dam, approximately downstream of its confluence with the Wheao River. The dam diverts all but at least 0.5 cumecs into the Wheao and Flaxy power scheme, which discharges into Wheao River which joins the Rangitaiki upstream of Murupara.

By the time it reaches the settlement at Murupara the river has a catchment of over 720 km.

Within downstream of Murupara, two major tributaries, the Whirinaki River and the Horomanga River enter the river on the eastern side. The river then continues north over the Galatea Plains before it enters the man-made Lake Āniwaniwa, the waters of which power the Aniwhenua Power Station.

Below the power station the river passes over the Aniwhenua falls and then squeezes through a narrow chasm. Downstream of the dam, the main channel passes through a gorge and then out onto the Waiohau Plains and past the settlement of Waihau. Several small tributaries arising in the Ikawhenua Ranges cross the Waiohau Plains to join the Rangitaiki.

The river travels for across the Waiohau Plains before it enters a gorge housing the man-made Lake Matahina the waters of which power the Matahina Power Station. No major tributaries enter the river downstream of the Lake Matahina. Below Matahina the Rangitaiki passes the village of Te Mahoe and through a well-defined valley before crossing the 29,000 ha Rangitaiki Plains and passing the settlements of Te Teko, Edgecumbe and Thornton. At Edgecumbe a large dairy factory owned by Fonterra discharges waste products into the river.

The river finally enters the sea at Thornton through a man made long channel.

==Watershed==
Prior to the completion of the Matahina Dam annual discharge figures for suspended and bed load sediment near the river mouth were about 201,000 and 188,000 tonne respectively, Since then the Matahina dam has acted as an effective barrier to the seaward movement of sediment by the Rangitaiki River, with equivalent post-dam values have dropped to 65,000 and 10,000 tonne.
This trapping of sediment has halted or substantially reduced the downstream historical rising river bed and coastal progradation of the Rangitaiki plains. 

Since the completion of the upstream Aniwhenua dam in 1982, it had become the principal sediment capture point though an increasing amount of sediment is being deposited in the deep portion of Lake Matahina.
The river&#x27;s condition is monitored at Murupara, Aniwhenua and Te Teko.

==River modifications==
The arrival of Europeans in the area lead to draining of wetland and low-lying areas along the river to create usable agricultural and horticultural lands. To support these activities the Rangitaiki Land Drainage Act was passed in 1910. Once the Rangitaiki plains approximately 40,000 hectares of wetland was drained and converted to farmland. At the same time the existing dual discharges of the river towards the Whakatāne River to the east and the Tarawera River estuary to the west were replaced by the cutting of a channel near Thornton to provide a new direct outlet for the Rangitaiki to the sea. Within a day of the new outlet being opened in May 1914 the level of the Rangitaiki in the lower sections of the Rangitaiki Plains area dropped by approximately. This fall of the river level encouraged further agricultural and horticultural development in this area following the end of World War I.

The hydro-electric potential of the river has been utilized by the construction of the following generation stations:
*Matahina Power Station: Commissioned in 1967 the associated 86 m high Matahina Dam has impounds the river to create Lake Matahina. Due to the lake&#x27;s limited storage capacity the power station operates as a run of the river scheme. The power station can generate up to 80 MW.
*Aniwhenua Power Station: Commissioned in 1981, above the Āniwaniwa Falls its associated 10 high dam impounds the Rangitaiki River and Pokairoa Stream at their confluence at Black Road, Galatea, approximately upstream from the river mouth to create Lake Āniwaniwa (unofficially known as Lake Aniwhenua). The lake supports a regionally significant trout fishery, as well as duck shooting and other recreation activities. Due to the lake&#x27;s limited storage capacity the power station operates as a run of the river scheme. The power station can generate up to 25 MW.
*Wheao and Flaxy Power Scheme: Located in the Kaingaroa forest this scheme was commissioned in 1980 and diverts water from the Flaxy Creek, Rangitaiki and Wheao rivers to power the 24 MW Wheao and the 2.1 MW Flaxy Power Stations. Due to the scheme&#x27;s limited storage capacity it operates as a run of the river scheme.

===Stopbanks===
The development of flood control, mitigation schemes and drainage schemes was undertaken u to the requirements of the Land Drainage Act 1908, Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941, and specificity for the Rangitaiki catchment Rangitaiki Land Drainage Act 1910 and the Rangitāiki Land Drainage Act 1956.
To assist in controlling floods settlements and productive land downstream of Te Teko is protected by a system of stopbanks (also known as floodbanks). These are designed to provide protection from a 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood (also known as the “100 year” flood).

== Tributaries ==
Heading downstream from its source the river has the following tributaries:
*Otamatea River.
*Otangimoana Stream. Also known as Dry Fly Creek
*Wheao River. This joins the Rangitaiki upstream of Murupara.
* Horomanga River. This river which joins the Rangitaiki north of Murupara has a catchment of 218 km. Like the Whirinaki this rises in the Ikawhenua Ranges and also contributes relatively large flood flows (and quantities of shingle) to the Rangitaiki. 
*Haumea Stream.
* Whirinaki River. This rivers which joins the Rangitaiki north of Murupara has a catchment of 527 km. This river rises in the steep bush–covered Ikawhenua Ranges. Being composed of greywacke rock, with little absorption ability there is a resulting high runoff and so it consequently contributes relatively large flood flows (and quantities of shingle) to the Rangitaiki.
*Mangamako Stream, 
*Waihua Stream
*Waikakopu Stream.
*Pokairoa Stream.

<text>The Gauss–Newton algorithm is used to solve non-linear least squares problems, which is equivalent to minimizing a sum of squared function values. It is an extension of Newton&#x27;s method for finding a minimum of a non-linear function. Since a sum of squares must be nonnegative, the algorithm can be viewed as using Newton&#x27;s method to iteratively approximate zeroes of the components of the sum, and thus minimizing the sum. In this sense, the algorithm is also an effective method for solving overdetermined systems of equations. It has the advantage that second derivatives, which can be challenging to compute, are not required.

Non-linear least squares problems arise, for instance, in non-linear regression, where parameters in a model are sought such that the model is in good agreement with available observations.

The method is named after the mathematicians Carl Friedrich Gauss and Isaac Newton, and first appeared in Gauss&#x27;s 1809 work &quot;Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum&quot;.

== Description ==
Given formula_1 functions formula_2 (often called residuals) of formula_3 variables formula_4 with formula_5 the Gauss–Newton algorithm iteratively finds the value of formula_6 that minimize the sum of squares
formula_7

Starting with an initial guess formula_8 for the minimum, the method proceeds by the iterations
formula_9

where, if r and β are column vectors, the entries of the Jacobian matrix are
formula_10

and the symbol formula_11 denotes the matrix transpose.

At each iteration, the update formula_12 can be found by rearranging the previous equation in the following two steps:

*formula_13
*formula_14 

With substitutions formula_15, formula_16, and formula_17, this turns into the conventional matrix equation of form formula_18, which can then be solved in a variety of methods (see Notes).

If , the iteration simplifies to

formula_19

which is a direct generalization of Newton&#x27;s method in one dimension.

In data fitting, where the goal is to find the parameters formula_20 such that a given model function formula_21 best fits some data points formula_22, the functions formula_23are the residuals:
formula_24

Then, the Gauss–Newton method can be expressed in terms of the Jacobian formula_25 of the function formula_26 as
formula_27

Note that formula_28 is the left pseudoinverse of formula_29.

==Notes==

The assumption in the algorithm statement is necessary, as otherwise the matrix formula_30 is not invertible and the normal equations cannot be solved (at least uniquely).

The Gauss–Newton algorithm can be derived by linearly approximating the vector of functions &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Using Taylor&#x27;s theorem, we can write at every iteration:
formula_31

with formula_32. The task of finding formula_33 minimizing the sum of squares of the right-hand side; i.e.,
formula_34

is a linear least-squares problem, which can be solved explicitly, yielding the normal equations in the algorithm.

The normal equations are &quot;n&quot; simultaneous linear equations in the unknown increments formula_33. They may be solved in one step, using Cholesky decomposition, or, better, the QR factorization of formula_36. For large systems, an iterative method, such as the conjugate gradient method, may be more efficient. If there is a linear dependence between columns of Jr, the iterations will fail, as formula_30 becomes singular.

When formula_38 is complex formula_39 the conjugate form should be used: formula_40.

==Example==

In this example, the Gauss–Newton algorithm will be used to fit a model to some data by minimizing the sum of squares of errors between the data and model&#x27;s predictions.

In a biology experiment studying the relation between substrate concentration and reaction rate in an enzyme-mediated reaction, the data in the following table were obtained. 
It is desired to find a curve (model function) of the form
formula_41

that fits best the data in the least-squares sense, with the parameters formula_42 and formula_43 to be determined.

Denote by formula_44 and formula_45 the values of and rate respectively, with formula_46. Let formula_47 and formula_48. We will find formula_49 and formula_50 such that the sum of squares of the residuals
formula_51

is minimized.

The Jacobian formula_52 of the vector of residuals formula_53 with respect to the unknowns formula_54 is a formula_55 matrix with the formula_56-th row having the entries
formula_57

Starting with the initial estimates of formula_58 and formula_59, after five iterations of the Gauss–Newton algorithm, the optimal values formula_60 and formula_61 are obtained. The sum of squares of residuals decreased from the initial value of 1.445 to 0.00784 after the fifth iteration. The plot in the figure on the right shows the curve determined by the model for the optimal parameters with the observed data.

==Convergence properties==

The Gauss-Newton iteration is guaranteed to converge toward a local minimum point formula_62 under 4 conditions: The functions formula_63 are twice continuously differentiable in an open convex set formula_64, the Jacobian formula_65 is of full column rank, the initial iterate formula_66 is near formula_62, and the local minimum value formula_68 is small. The convergence is quadratic if formula_69.

It can be shown that the increment Δ is a descent direction for , and, if the algorithm converges, then the limit is a stationary point of . For large minimum value formula_68, however, convergence is not guaranteed, not even local convergence as in Newton&#x27;s method, or convergence under the usual Wolfe conditions.

The rate of convergence of the Gauss–Newton algorithm can approach quadratic. The algorithm may converge slowly or not at all if the initial guess is far from the minimum or the matrix formula_71 is ill-conditioned. For example, consider the problem with formula_72 equations and formula_73 variable, given by
formula_74

For formula_75, formula_76 is a local optimum. If formula_77, then the problem is in fact linear and the method finds the optimum in one iteration. If |λ| &lt; 1, then the method converges linearly and the error decreases asymptotically with a factor |λ| at every iteration. However, if |λ| &gt; 1, then the method does not even converge locally.

==Solving overdetermined systems of equations==

The Gauss-Newton iteration
formula_78
is an effective method for solving overdetermined systems of equations in the form of formula_79 with
formula_80
and formula_81 where formula_82 is the Moore-Penrose inverse (also known as pseudoinverse) of the Jacobian matrix formula_83 of formula_84. 
It can be considered an extension of Newton&#x27;s method and enjoys the same local quadratic convergence toward isolated regular solutions. 

If the solution doesn&#x27;t exist but the initial iterate formula_85 is near a point formula_86 at which the sum of squares formula_87 reaches a small local minimum, the Gauss-Newton iteration linearly converges to formula_88. The point formula_88 is often called a least squares solution of the overdetermined system.

== Derivation from Newton&#x27;s method ==

In what follows, the Gauss–Newton algorithm will be derived from Newton&#x27;s method for function optimization via an approximation. As a consequence, the rate of convergence of the Gauss–Newton algorithm can be quadratic under certain regularity conditions. In general (under weaker conditions), the convergence rate is linear.

The recurrence relation for Newton&#x27;s method for minimizing a function &quot;S&quot; of parameters formula_90 is
formula_91

where g denotes the gradient vector of &quot;S&quot;, and H denotes the Hessian matrix of &quot;S&quot;.

Since formula_92, the gradient is given by
formula_93

Elements of the Hessian are calculated by differentiating the gradient elements, formula_94, with respect to formula_95:
formula_96

The Gauss–Newton method is obtained by ignoring the second-order derivative terms (the second term in this expression). That is, the Hessian is approximated by
formula_97

where formula_98 are entries of the Jacobian Jr. Note that when the exact hessian is evaluated near an exact fit we have near-zero formula_53, so the second term becomes near-zero as well, which justifies the approximation. The gradient and the approximate Hessian can be written in matrix notation as
formula_100

These expressions are substituted into the recurrence relation above to obtain the operational equations
formula_101

Convergence of the Gauss–Newton method is not guaranteed in all instances. The approximation
formula_102

that needs to hold to be able to ignore the second-order derivative terms may be valid in two cases, for which convergence is to be expected:
# The function values formula_53 are small in magnitude, at least around the minimum. 
# The functions are only &quot;mildly&quot; nonlinear, so that formula_104 is relatively small in magnitude.

== Improved versions ==

With the Gauss–Newton method the sum of squares of the residuals &quot;S&quot; may not decrease at every iteration. However, since Δ is a descent direction, unless formula_105 is a stationary point, it holds that formula_106 for all sufficiently small formula_107. Thus, if divergence occurs, one solution is to employ a fraction formula_108 of the increment vector Δ in the updating formula:
formula_109

In other words, the increment vector is too long, but it still points &quot;downhill&quot;, so going just a part of the way will decrease the objective function &quot;S&quot;. An optimal value for formula_108 can be found by using a line search algorithm, that is, the magnitude of formula_108 is determined by finding the value that minimizes &quot;S&quot;, usually using a direct search method in the interval formula_112 or a backtracking line search such as Armijo-line search. Typically, formula_108 should be chosen such that it satisfies the Wolfe conditions or the Goldstein conditions.

In cases where the direction of the shift vector is such that the optimal fraction α is close to zero, an alternative method for handling divergence is the use of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, a trust region method. The normal equations are modified in such a way that the increment vector is rotated towards the direction of steepest descent,
formula_114

where D is a positive diagonal matrix. Note that when D is the identity matrix I and formula_115, then formula_116, therefore the direction of Δ approaches the direction of the negative gradient formula_117.

The so-called Marquardt parameter formula_118 may also be optimized by a line search, but this is inefficient, as the shift vector must be recalculated every time formula_118 is changed. A more efficient strategy is this: When divergence occurs, increase the Marquardt parameter until there is a decrease in &quot;S&quot;. Then retain the value from one iteration to the next, but decrease it if possible until a cut-off value is reached, when the Marquardt parameter can be set to zero; the minimization of &quot;S&quot; then becomes a standard Gauss–Newton minimization.

==Large-scale optimization==

For large-scale optimization, the Gauss–Newton method is of special interest because it is often (though certainly not always) true that the matrix formula_120 is more sparse than the approximate Hessian formula_121. In such cases, the step calculation itself will typically need to be done with an approximate iterative method appropriate for large and sparse problems, such as the conjugate gradient method.

In order to make this kind of approach work, one needs at least an efficient method for computing the product
formula_122

for some vector p. With sparse matrix storage, it is in general practical to store the rows of formula_120 in a compressed form (e.g., without zero entries), making a direct computation of the above product tricky due to the transposition. However, if one defines c&quot;i&quot; as row &quot;i&quot; of the matrix formula_120, the following simple relation holds:
formula_125

so that every row contributes additively and independently to the product. In addition to respecting a practical sparse storage structure, this expression is well suited for parallel computations. Note that every row c&quot;i&quot; is the gradient of the corresponding residual &quot;r&quot;&quot;i&quot;; with this in mind, the formula above emphasizes the fact that residuals contribute to the problem independently of each other.

== Related algorithms ==

In a quasi-Newton method, such as that due to Davidon, Fletcher and Powell or Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS method) an estimate of the full Hessian formula_126 is built up numerically using first derivatives formula_127 only so that after &quot;n&quot; refinement cycles the method closely approximates to Newton&#x27;s method in performance. Note that quasi-Newton methods can minimize general real-valued functions, whereas Gauss–Newton, Levenberg–Marquardt, etc. fits only to nonlinear least-squares problems.

Another method for solving minimization problems using only first derivatives is gradient descent. However, this method does not take into account the second derivatives even approximately. Consequently, it is highly inefficient for many functions, especially if the parameters have strong interactions.

<text>A fire-tube boiler is a type of boiler invented in 1828 by Marc Seguin, in which hot gases pass from a fire through one or more tubes running through a sealed container of water. The heat of the gases is transferred through the walls of the tubes by thermal conduction, heating the water and ultimately creating steam.

The fire-tube boiler developed as the third of the four major historical types of boilers: low-pressure tank or &quot;haystack&quot; boilers, flued boilers with one or two large flues, fire-tube boilers with many small tubes, and high-pressure water-tube boilers. Their advantage over flued boilers with a single large flue is that the many small tubes offer far greater heating surface area for the same overall boiler volume. The general construction is as a tank of water penetrated by tubes that carry the hot flue gases from the fire. The tank is usually cylindrical for the most part—being the strongest practical shape for a pressurized container—and this cylindrical tank may be either horizontal or vertical.

This type of boiler was used on virtually all steam locomotives in the horizontal &quot;locomotive&quot; form. This has a cylindrical barrel containing the fire tubes, but also has an extension at one end to house the &quot;firebox&quot;. This firebox has an open base to provide a large grate area and often extends beyond the cylindrical barrel to form a rectangular or tapered enclosure. The horizontal fire-tube boiler is also typical of marine applications, using the Scotch boiler; thus, these boilers are commonly referred to as &quot;scotch-marine&quot; or &quot;marine&quot; type boilers. Vertical boilers have also been built of the multiple fire-tube type, although these are comparatively rare; most vertical boilers were either flued, or with cross water-tubes.

== Operation ==

In the locomotive-type boiler, fuel is burnt in a firebox to produce hot combustion gases. The firebox is surrounded by a cooling jacket of water connected to the long, cylindrical boiler shell. The hot gases are directed along a series of &quot;fire tubes&quot;, or &quot;flues&quot;, that penetrate the boiler and heat the water thereby generating saturated (&quot;wet&quot;) steam. The steam rises to the highest point of the boiler, the &quot;steam dome&quot;, where it is collected. The dome is the site of the &quot;regulator&quot; that controls the exit of steam from the boiler.

In the locomotive boiler, the saturated steam is very often passed into a &quot;superheater&quot;, back through the larger flues at the top of the boiler, to dry the steam and heat it to &quot;superheated steam&quot;. The superheated steam is directed to the steam engine&#x27;s cylinders or very rarely to a turbine to produce mechanical work. Exhaust gases are fed out through a chimney, and may be used to pre-heat the feed water to increase the efficiency of the boiler.

Draught for firetube boilers, particularly in marine applications, is usually provided by a tall smokestack. In all steam locomotives since Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Rocket&quot;, additional draught is supplied by directing exhaust steam from the cylinders into the smokestack through a blastpipe, to provide a partial vacuum. Modern industrial boilers use fans to provide forced or induced draughting of the boiler.

Another major advance in the &quot;Rocket&quot; was large numbers of small-diameter firetubes (a &quot;multi-tubular boiler&quot;) instead of a single large flue. This greatly increased the surface area for heat transfer, allowing steam to be produced at a much higher rate. Without this, steam locomotives could never have developed effectively as powerful prime movers.

== Types ==
&quot;For more details on the related ancestor type, see Flued boilers.&quot;

=== Cornish boiler ===

The earliest form of fire-tube boiler was Richard Trevithick&#x27;s &quot;high-pressure&quot; Cornish boiler. This is a long horizontal cylinder with a single large flue containing the fire. The fire itself was on an iron grating placed across this flue, with a shallow ashpan beneath to collect the non-combustible residue. Although considered as low-pressure (perhaps ) today, the use of a cylindrical boiler shell permitted a higher pressure than the earlier &quot;haystack&quot; boilers of Newcomen&#x27;s day. As the furnace relied on natural draught (air flow), a tall chimney was required at the far end of the flue to encourage a good supply of air (oxygen) to the fire.

For efficiency, the boiler was commonly encased beneath by a brick-built chamber. Flue gases were routed through this, outside the iron boiler shell, after passing through the fire-tube and so to a chimney that was now placed at the front face of the boiler.

=== Lancashire boiler ===

The Lancashire boiler is similar to the Cornish, but has two large flues containing the fires. It was the invention of William Fairbairn in 1844, from a theoretical consideration of the thermodynamics of more efficient boilers that led him to increase the furnace grate area relative to the volume of water.

Later developments added &quot;Galloway tubes&quot; (after their inventor, patented in 1848), crosswise water tubes across the flue, thus increasing the heated surface area. As these are short tubes of large diameter and the boiler continues to use a relatively low pressure, this is still not considered to be a water-tube boiler. The tubes are tapered, simply to make their installation through the flue easier.

=== Scotch marine boiler ===

The Scotch marine boiler differs dramatically from its predecessors in using a large number of small-diameter tubes. This gives a far greater heating surface area for the volume and weight. The furnace remains a single large-diameter tube with the many small tubes arranged above it. They are connected together through a combustion chamber – an enclosed volume contained entirely within the boiler shell – so that the flow of flue gas through the firetubes is from back to front. An enclosed smokebox covering the front of these tubes leads upwards to the chimney or funnel. Typical Scotch boilers had a pair of furnaces, larger ones had three. Above this size, such as for large steam ships, it was more usual to install multiple boilers.

=== Locomotive boiler ===

A locomotive boiler has three main components: a double-walled firebox; a horizontal, cylindrical &quot;boiler barrel&quot; containing a large number of small flue-tubes; and a smokebox with chimney, for the exhaust gases. The boiler barrel contains larger flue-tubes to carry the superheater elements, where present. Forced draught is provided in the locomotive boiler by injecting exhausted steam back into the exhaust via a blast pipe in the smokebox.

Locomotive-type boilers are also used in traction engines, steam rollers, portable engines and some other steam road vehicles. The inherent strength of the boiler means it is used as the basis for the vehicle: all the other components, including the wheels, are mounted on brackets attached to the boiler. It is rare to find superheaters designed into this type of boiler, and they are generally much smaller (and simpler) than railway locomotive types.

The locomotive-type boiler is also a characteristic of the overtype steam wagon, the steam-powered fore-runner of the truck. In this case, however, heavy girder frames make up the load-bearing chassis of the vehicle, and the boiler is attached to this.

;Taper boiler
Certain railway locomotive boilers are tapered from a larger diameter at the firebox end to a smaller diameter at the smokebox end. This reduces weight and improves water circulation. Many later Great Western Railway and London, Midland and Scottish Railway locomotives were designed or modified to take taper boilers.

=== Vertical fire-tube boiler ===

A vertical fire-tube boiler (VFT), colloquially known as the &quot;vertical boiler&quot;, has a vertical cylindrical shell, containing several vertical flue tubes.

=== Horizontal return tubular boiler ===

Horizontal return tubular boiler (HRT) has a horizontal cylindrical shell, containing several horizontal flue tubes, with the fire located directly below the boiler&#x27;s shell, usually within a brickwork setting

=== Admiralty-type direct tube boiler ===
Extensively used by Britain, before and in the early days of ironclads, the only protected place was below the waterline, sometimes under an armoured deck, so to fit below short decks, the tubes were not led back above the furnace but continued straight from it with keeping the combustion chamber in between the two. Hence the name, and considerably reduced diameter, compared to the ubiquitous Scotch or return tube boiler. It was not a great success and its use was being abandoned after the introduction of stronger side armouring – “the furnace crowns, being very near the water-level, are much more liable to over-heating. Further, on account of the length of the boiler, for an equal angle of inclination, the effect on the water-level is much greater. Finally, the unequal expansion of the various parts of the boiler is more pronounced, especially at the top and bottom, due to the increased ratio between the length and the diameter of the boiler; the local strains are also more severe on account of the comparatively feeble circulation in long and low boilers.” All these also resulted in a shorter life. Also, the same length of a combustion chamber was much less effective on a direct tube than on a return tube boiler, at least without baffling.

=== Immersion fired boiler ===
The immersion fired boiler is a single-pass fire-tube boiler that was developed by Sellers Engineering in the 1940s. It has only firetubes, functioning as a furnace and combustion chamber also, with multiple burner nozzles injecting premixed air and natural gas under pressure. It claims reduced thermal stresses, and lacks refractory brickwork completely due to its construction.

== Variations ==

=== Water tubes ===
Fire-tube boilers sometimes have water-tubes as well, to increase the heating surface. A Cornish boiler may have several water-tubes across the diameter of the flue (this is common in steam launches). A locomotive boiler with a wide firebox may have arch tubes or thermic syphons. As firebox technology developed, it was found that placing a baffle of &quot;firebricks&quot; (heat-resistant bricks) inside the firebox to direct the flow of hot flue gasses up into the top of the firebox before it flowed into the fire tubes increased efficiency by equalizing the heat between upper and lower fire tubes. To hold these in place, a metal bracket was used, but to prevent these brackets from burning and eroding away they were built as water tubes, with cool water from the bottom of the boiler moving upwards by convection as it heated, and carrying the heat away before the metal reached its failure temperature.

Another technique for increasing the heating surface is to include internal rifling inside the boiler tubes (also known as Serve tubes).

Not all shell boilers raise steam; some are designed specifically for heating pressurized water.

=== Reverse flame ===
In homage to the Lancashire design, modern shell boilers can come with a twin furnace design. A more recent development has been the reverse flame design where the burner fires into a blind furnace and the combustion gasses double back on themselves. This results in a more compact design and less pipework.

=== Package boiler ===
The term &quot;package&quot; boiler evolved in the early- to mid-20th century; it is used to describe residential heating boilers delivered to the installation site with all insulation, electrical panels, valves, gauges, and fuel burners already assembled by the manufacturer. Other delivery methods more closely resemble prior practice from the coal burning era, when other components were added on-site to either a pre-assembled pressure vessel, or to a &quot;knock-down&quot; boiler, where the pressure vessel is delivered as a set of castings to be assembled on-site. As a general rule, factory assembly is much more cost-effective and the packaged boiler is the preferred option for domestic use. Part-assembled deliveries are only used when necessary because of access limitations - e.g. when the only access to a basement installation site is down a narrow flight of stairs.

== Safety considerations ==

Because the fire-flume boiler itself is the pressure vessel, it requires a number of safety features to prevent mechanical failure. Boiler steam explosions, which are a type of BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion), can be devastating.
* Safety valves release steam before a dangerous pressure can be built up
* Fusible plugs over the firebox melt at a temperature lower than that of the firebox plates, thereby warning the operators by the noisy escape of steam if the water level is too low to cool the firebox crown safely.
* Stays, or ties, physically link the firebox and boiler casing, preventing them from warping. Since any corrosion is hidden, the stays may have longitudinal holes, called tell-tales, drilled in them which leak before they become unsafe.

The fire-tube type boiler that was used in the Stanley Steamer automobile had several hundred tubes which were weaker than the outer shell of the boiler, making an explosion virtually impossible as the tubes would fail and leak long before the boiler exploded. In nearly 100 years since Stanley boilers were first produced, not one has ever exploded.

== Economics and efficiencies ==

=== Excessive cycling ===
Each time a boiler cycles off and on, it can lose efficiency. When the fire starts combustion efficiency is usually lower until steady state conditions prevail. When the fire stops the warm chimney continues to draw additional air from the interior space until it cools.

Excessive cycling can be minimized
* Modulating boilers can run longer (at firing rates that match the loads) than the non-modulating boilers (which operate at the full firing rate).
** By using condensing modulating boilers.
** By using non-condensing modulating boiler.
** By setting the controls (thermostats or controller with temperature sensors) with greater temperature differentials between STOP and START.
* At Non-Condensing Boilers make provisions so that minimum return water temperature of to to the boiler to avoid fireside corrosion.
** By setting the MINIMUM OFF times at 8 to 15 minutes. For comfort heating loads, short time intervals do not usually trigger occupant complaints.

Common provisions are to provide a primary piping loop with pump(s) and a secondary piping loop with pump(s); and either a variable speed controlled pump to transfer water from the primary loop to the secondary loop, or a 3-way valve to divert water from the secondary loop to the primary loop.

==== Fireside corrosion in non-condensing boilers ====
A minimum return water temperature of to to the boiler, depending on the specific design, is used to avoid condensing water vapor from the flue gas and dissolving and from the flue gasses forming carbonic and sulfuric acid, a corrosive fluid that damages the heat exchanger.

=== Condensing boilers ===
Condensing boilers can be 2% or more efficient at lower firing rates by extracting the heat of vaporization from the water vapor in the flue gases. The efficiency increase depends on the fuel and the available energy to be recovered as a fraction of the total. Methane flue gas containing more available energy to recover than propane or fuel oil relatively less. The condensed water is corrosive due to dissolved carbon dioxide and sulfur oxides from the flue and must be neutralized before disposal.

Condensing boilers have a higher seasonal efficiency, typically 84% to 92%, than non-condensing boilers typically 70% to 75%. The seasonal efficiency is an overall efficiency of the boiler over the entire heating season as opposed to the combustion efficiency which is the boiler&#x27;s efficiency when actively fired, which excludes standing losses. The higher seasonal efficiency is partly because the lower boiler temperature used to condense the flue gas reduces standing losses during the off cycle. The lower boiler temperature precludes a condensing steam boiler and requires lower radiator temperatures in water systems.

The higher efficiency of operating in the condensing region isn&#x27;t always available. To produce satisfactory domestic hot water frequently requires boiler water temperature higher than allows effective condensing on the heat exchanger surface. During cold weather the building&#x27;s radiator surface area is usually not large enough to deliver enough heat at low boiler temperatures so the boiler&#x27;s control raises the boiler temperature as required to meet heating demand. These two factors account for most of the variability of the efficiency gains experienced at different installations.

== Maintenance ==
An intensive schedule of maintenance is needed to keep a high pressure railway steam boiler in safe condition.

=== Daily inspection ===
The tube plates, the fusible plug and the heads of the firebox stays should be checked for leaks. The correct operation of the boiler fittings, especially the water gauges and water feed mechanisms, should be confirmed. Steam pressure should be raised to the level at which the safety valves lift and compared with the indication of the pressure gauge.

=== Washout ===
 The working life of a locomotive boiler is considerably extended if it is spared from a constant cycle of cooling and heating. Historically, a locomotive would be kept “in steam” continuously for a period of about eight to ten days, and then allowed to cool sufficiently for a hot-water boiler washout. The schedule for express engines was based on mileage. Today&#x27;s preserved locomotives are not usually kept continuously in steam and the recommended washout interval is now fifteen to thirty days, but anything up to 180 days is possible.

The process starts with a “blowdown” while some pressure remains in the boiler, then the draining away of all the boiler water through the “mudholes” at the base of the firebox and the removal of all the “washout plugs”. Scale is then jetted or scraped from the interior surfaces using a high-pressure water jet and rods of soft metal, such as copper. Areas particularly susceptible to scale buildup, such as the firebox crown and narrow water spaces around the firebox, are given special attention. The inside of the boiler is inspected by sighting through the plug holes, with a particular check paid to the integrity of the firetubes, firebox crown and stays and absence of pitting or cracking of the boiler plates. The gauge glass cocks and tubes and fusible plug should be cleared of scale; if the core of the fusible plug shows signs of calcination the item should be replaced.

On reassembly care should be taken that the threaded plugs are replaced in their original holes: the tapers can vary as a result of rethreading. The mudhole door gaskets, if of asbestos, should be renewed but those made of lead may be reused; special instructions are in force for the disposal of these harmful materials. Many boilers today make use of high temperature synthetics for the gaskets for both working environments and in preservation service as these materials are safer than the historic options. At large maintenance facilities the boiler would have been both washed and refilled with very hot water from an external supply to bring the locomotive back to service more quickly.

=== Periodic examination ===
Typically an annual inspection, this would require the removal and check of external fittings, such as the injectors, safety valves and pressure gauge. High-pressure copper pipework can suffer from work hardening in use and become dangerously brittle: it may be necessary to treat these by annealing before refitting. A hydraulic pressure test on the boiler and pipework may also be called for.

=== General overhaul ===
In the UK the specified maximum interval between full overhauls is ten years. To enable a full inspection the boiler is lifted from the locomotive frame and the lagging removed. All firetubes are removed for checking or replacement. All fittings are removed for overhaul. Before returning to use a qualified examiner will check the boiler&#x27;s fitness for service and issue a safety certificate valid for ten years.

<doc id="1164759" wikidata="Q1358526" url="?curid=1164759" title="Water-tube boiler">
<text>A high pressure watertube boiler (also spelled water-tube and water tube) is a type of boiler in which water circulates in tubes heated externally by fire. Fuel is burned inside the furnace, creating hot gas which boils water in the steam-generating tubes. In smaller boilers, additional generating tubes are separate in the furnace, while larger utility boilers rely on the water-filled tubes that make up the walls of the furnace to generate steam.

The heated water/steam mixture then rises into the steam drum. Here, saturated steam is drawn off the top of the drum. In some services, the steam passes through tubes in the hot gas path, (a superheater) to become superheated. Superheated steam is a dry gas and therefore is typically used to drive turbines, since water droplets can severely damage turbine blades.

Saturated water at the bottom of the steam drum returns to the lower drum via large-bore &#x27;downcomer tubes&#x27;, where it pre-heats the feedwater supply. (In large utility boilers, the feedwater is supplied to the steam drum and the downcomers supply water to the bottom of the waterwalls). To increase economy of the boiler, exhaust gases are also used to pre-heat combustion air blown into the burners, and to warm the feedwater supply in an economizer. Such watertube boilers in thermal power stations are also called &quot;steam generating units&quot;.

The older fire-tube boiler design, in which the water surrounds the heat source and gases from combustion pass through tubes within the water space, is typically a much weaker structure and is rarely used for pressures above . A significant advantage of the watertube boiler is that there is less chance of a catastrophic failure: there is not a large volume of water in the boiler nor are there large mechanical elements subject to failure.

A water-tube boiler was patented by Blakey of England in 1766 and was made by Dallery of France in 1780.

== Applications ==
&quot;The ability of watertube boilers to be designed without the use of excessively large and thick-walled pressure vessels makes these boilers particularly attractive in applications that require dry, high-pressure, high-energy steam, including steam turbine power generation&quot;.

Owing to their superb working properties, the use of watertube boilers is highly preferred in the following major areas:
* Variety of process applications in industries
* Chemical processing divisions
* Pulp and Paper manufacturing plants
* Refining units
Besides, they are frequently employed in power generation plants where large quantities of steam (ranging up to 500 kg/s) having high pressures i.e. approximately and high temperatures reaching up to 550 °C are generally required. For example, the Ivanpah solar-power station uses two Rentech Type-D watertube boilers for plant warmup, and when operating as a fossil-fueled power station.

=== Stationary ===
Modern boilers for power generation are almost entirely water-tube designs, owing to their ability to operate at higher pressures. Where process steam is required for heating or as a chemical component, then there is still a small niche for fire-tube boilers. One notable exception is in typical nuclear-power stations (Pressurized Water Reactors), where the steam generators are generally configured similar to firetube boiler designs. In these applications the hot gas path through the &quot;Firetubes&quot; actually carries the very hot/high pressure primary coolant from the reactor, and steam is generated on the external surface of the tubes.

=== Marine ===
Their ability to work at higher pressures has led to marine boilers being almost entirely watertube. This change began around 1900, and traced the adoption of turbines for propulsion rather than reciprocating (i.e. piston) engines – although watertube boilers were also used with reciprocating engines, and firetube boilers were also used in many marine turbine applications.

=== Railway ===
There has been no significant adoption of water-tube boilers for railway locomotives. A handful of experimental designs were produced, but none of them were successful or led to their widespread use. Most water-tube railway locomotives, especially in Europe, used the Schmidt system. Most were compounds, and a few uniflows. The Norfolk and Western Railway&#x27;s &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; was an exception, because it used a steam turbine combined with an electric transmission.
* LMS 6399 Fury
: Rebuilt completely after a fatal accident
* LNER 10000 &quot;Hush hush&quot;
: Using a Yarrow boiler, rather than Schmidt. Not successful and re-boilered with a conventional boiler.

==== Hybrids ====

A slightly more successful adoption was the use of hybrid water-tube / fire-tube systems. As the hottest part of a locomotive boiler is the firebox, it was an effective design to use a water-tube design here and a conventional fire-tube boiler as an economiser (i.e. pre-heater) in the usual position. One famous example of this was the USA Baldwin 4-10-2 No. 60000, built in 1926. Operating as a compound at a boiler pressure of it covered over successfully. After a year though, it became clear that any economies were overwhelmed by the extra costs, and it was retired to a museum display at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A series of twelve experimental locomotives were constructed at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Mt. Clare shops under the supervision of George H. Emerson, but none of them was replicated in any numbers.

The only railway use of water-tube boilers in any numbers was the Brotan boiler, invented by Johann Brotan in Austria in 1902, and found in rare examples throughout Europe, although Hungary was a keen user and had around 1,000 of them. Like the Baldwin, it combined a water-tube firebox with a fire-tube barrel. The original characteristic of the Brotan was a long steam drum running &quot;above&quot; the main barrel, making it resemble a Flaman boiler in appearance.

=== Road ===
While the traction engine was usually built using its locomotive boiler as its frame, other types of steam road vehicles such as lorries and cars have used a wide range of different boiler types. Road transport pioneers Goldsworthy Gurney and Walter Hancock both used water-tube boilers in their steam carriages around 1830.

Most undertype wagons used water-tube boilers. Many manufacturers used variants of the vertical cross-tube boiler, including Atkinson, Clayton, Garrett and Sentinel. Other types include the Clarkson &#x27;thimble tube&#x27; and the Foden O-type wagon&#x27;s pistol-shaped boiler.

Steam fire-engine makers such as Merryweather usually used water-tube boilers for their rapid steam-raising capacity.

Many steam cars used water-tube boilers, and the Bolsover Express company even made a water-tube replacement for the Stanley Steamer fire-tube boiler.

== Design variations ==
=== D-type boiler ===
The &#x27;D-type&#x27; is the most common type of small- to medium-sized boilers, similar to the one shown in the schematic diagram. It is used in both stationary and marine applications. It consists of a large steam drum vertically connected to a smaller water drum (a.k.a. &quot;mud drum&quot;) via multiple steam-generating tubes. These drums and tubes as well as the oil-fired burner are enclosed by water-walls - additional water-filled tubes spaced close together so as to prevent gas flow between them. These water wall tubes are connected to both the steam and water drums, so that they act as a combination of preheaters and downcomers as well as decreasing heat loss to the boiler shell.

===M-type boilers===
The M-type boilers were used in many US World War II warships including hundreds of &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyers. Three sets of tubes form the shape of an M, and create a separately fired superheater that allows better superheat temperature control. In addition to the mud drum shown on a D-type boiler, an M-type has a water-screen header and a waterwall header at the bottom of the two additional rows of vertical tubes and downcomers.

=== Low water content ===
The &quot;low water content&quot; boiler has a lower and upper header connected by watertubes that are directly impinged upon from the burner. This is a &quot;furnace-less&quot; boiler that can generate steam and react quickly to changes in load.

=== Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler ===

Designed by the American firm of Babcock &amp; Wilcox, this type has a single drum, with feedwater drawn from the bottom of the drum into a header that supplies inclined water-tubes. The watertubes supply steam back into the top of the drum. Furnaces are located below the tubes and drum.

This type of boiler was used by the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates and in United States Navy New Orleans-class cruisers.

=== Stirling boiler ===

The Stirling boiler has near-vertical, almost-straight watertubes that zig-zag between a number of steam and water drums. Usually there are three banks of tubes in a &quot;four drum&quot; layout, but certain applications use variations designed with a different number of drums and banks. They are mainly used as stationary boilers, owing to their large size, although the large grate area does also encourage their ability to burn a wide range of fuels. Originally coal-fired in power stations, they also became widespread in industries that produced combustible waste and required process steam. Paper pulp mills could burn waste bark, sugar refineries their bagasse waste. It is a horizontal drum type of boiler.

=== Yarrow ===
Named after its designers, the then Poplar-based Yarrow Shipbuilders, this type of three-drum boiler has three drums in a delta formation connected by watertubes. The drums are linked by straight watertubes, allowing easy tube-cleaning. This does, however, mean that the tubes enter the drums at varying angles, a more difficult joint to caulk. Outside the firebox, a pair of cold-leg pipes between each drum act as downcomers.

Due to its three drums, the Yarrow boiler has a greater water capacity. Hence, this type is usually used in older marine boiler applications. Its compact size made it attractive for use in transportable power generation units during World War II. In order to make it transportable, the boiler and its auxiliary equipment (fuel oil heating, pumping units, fans etc.), turbines, and condensers were mounted on wagons to be transported by rail.

=== White-Forster ===
The White-Forster type is similar to the Yarrow, but with tubes that are gradually curved. This makes their entry into the drums perpendicular, thus simpler to make a reliable seal.

=== Thornycroft ===

Designed by the shipbuilder John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company, the Thornycroft type features a single steam drum with two sets of watertubes either side of the furnace. These tubes, especially the central set, have sharp curves. Apart from obvious difficulties in cleaning them, this may also give rise to bending forces as the tubes warm up, tending to pull them loose from the tubeplate and creating a leak. There are two furnaces, venting into a common exhaust, giving the boiler a wide base tapering profile.

=== Forced circulation boiler ===
In a forced circulation boiler, a pump is added to speed up the flow of water through the tubes.

=== Other types ===
* O-type boiler
* A-type boiler
* Flex-tube boiler
* M-type control superheater

* Corner tube boiler

<doc id="1164768" wikidata="Q1131303" url="?curid=1164768" title="Loam">
<text>Loam (in geology and soil science) is soil composed mostly of sand (particle size &gt; ), silt (particle size &gt; ), and a smaller amount of clay (particle size &lt; ). By weight, its mineral composition is about 40–40–20% concentration of sand–silt–clay, respectively. These proportions can vary to a degree, however, and result in different types of loam soils: sandy loam, silty loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, and loam.

In the United States Department of Agriculture, textural classification triangle, the only soil that is not predominantly sand, silt, or clay is called &quot;loam&quot;. Loam soils generally contain more nutrients, moisture, and humus than sandy soils, have better drainage and infiltration of water and air than silt- and clay-rich soils, and are easier to till than clay soils. In fact, the primary definition of loam in most dictionaries is soils containing humus (organic content) with no mention of particle size or texture, and this definition is used by many gardeners. The different types of loam soils each have slightly different characteristics, with some draining liquids more efficiently than others. The soil&#x27;s texture, especially its ability to retain nutrients and water, are crucial. Loam soil is suitable for growing most plant varieties.

Bricks made of loam, mud, sand, and water, with an added binding material such as rice husks or straw, have been used in construction since ancient times.

==Classifications==
Loam soils can be classified into more specific subtypes. Some examples are sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam. Different soil phases have some variation in characteristics like stoniness and erosion that are too minor to affect native vegetative growth but can be significant for crop cultivation.

==Use in farming==

Loam is considered ideal for gardening and agricultural uses because it retains nutrients well and retains water while still allowing excess water to drain away. A soil dominated by one or two of the three particle size groups can behave like loam if it has a strong granular structure, promoted by a high content of organic matter. However, a soil that meets the textural (geological) definition of loam can lose its characteristic desirable qualities when it is compacted, depleted of organic matter, or has clay dispersed throughout its fine-earth fraction.

For example, pea can be cultivated in sandy loam and clay loam soils, but not more compacted sandy soils.

==Use in house construction==

Loam (the high-humus definition, not the soil texture definition) may be used for the construction of houses, for example in loam post and beam construction. Building crews can build a layer of loam on the inside of walls, which can help to control air humidity. Loam, combined with straw, can be used as rough construction material to build walls. This is one of the oldest technologies for house construction in the world. Within this there are two broad methods: the use of rammed earth, or unfired bricks (adobe).

<doc id="1164769" wikidata="Q7762773" url="?curid=1164769" title="The Sea Shall Not Have Them">
<text>The Sea Shall Not Have Them is a 1954 British war film starring Michael Redgrave, Dirk Bogarde and Anthony Steel. It was directed by Lewis Gilbert and is based on the 1953 novel by John Harris, about a North Sea rescue during the Second World War. The musical soundtrack is by composer Malcolm Arnold.

The film title is the motto of the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Air Sea Rescue Service. Gilbert called it &quot;standard fare&quot; but it &quot;did very well.&quot;

==Plot==
It is the autumn of 1944. Allied armies are sweeping through France towards Germany. A British Lockheed Hudson has been damaged in aerial combat with a German Messerschmitt, with both aircraft ditching in the North Sea, twenty miles off the Dutch coast. The four crew from the British aircraft are unable to send a complete mayday alert, although a signal fragment reaches England. Among them is Air Commodore Waltby who has a briefcase containing secret German plans for the successor to the V1 and V2. Flight Sergeant Mackay assumes a leading role in the rescue dinghy, tying everyone together to prevent anyone falling overboard, and sharing his boots with the pilot despite the cold. As the weather closes in and a freezing cold night descends, aircraft suspend their search, leaving the now waterlogged dinghy to face the sea alone. Waltby orders the others that if he dies, they must get the briefcase to London or throw it overboard should they face capture.

An RAF Air Sea Rescue sea launch joins the search. Commanded by Flying Officer Treherne, Launch 2561, or &quot;Sixty One&quot; in radio signals, struggles against the bad weather, mechanical problems and a fire in the galley. Second in command, Flight Sergeant Singsby dominates the crew, playing a benevolent but demanding hand with the questionable seamanship of the junior ranks. On the second day, updated intelligence about the dinghy&#x27;s likely location is received from the downed German Messerschmitt pilot, whom the RAF has rescued. RAF Air Sea Rescue is now aware the dinghy has drifted inshore, far from its ditching point. As the weather clears, &quot;Sixty One&quot; sights the dinghy and approaches it under fire from enemy shore batteries and through a mine field. Launch 2561 safely returns to England where the briefcase with secret documents is delivered. An injured Flying Officer Treherne and Flight Sergeant Mackay are applauded by senior officers.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was based on a 1953 book by Max Hennessy, which became a best seller.

In August 1953, it was announced that both Rank and ABPC were competing for the film rights, which were expected to go for $20,000.

Producer Dan Angel arranged one of the strongest male casts of the era. It was one of a number of sea-related themes made in Britain following the success of &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;. It was one of a number of war movies Anthony Steel made in which he was supporting of an older British star.

There were six weeks filming on location in Felixstowe, followed by studio work at Riverside.

Referring to the film&#x27;s title, Noël Coward said of the film&#x27;s two male stars, &quot;I don&#x27;t see why not. Everyone else has.&quot; Redgrave was reportedly bisexual, while Bogarde was homosexual.

The film was shot at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith and Felixstowe in Suffolk. Filming had finished by June 1954.

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;Variety&quot; said the film &quot;has several basic ingredients of a boxoffice success; 
tough but believable plot, a cast too big for the average theatre marquee and exciting action sequences in the climax when the missing air crew is picked up within range of enemy shore batteries.&quot;

===Box office===
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; it was a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office in 1955. The film performed poorly at the US box office, like most British war movies of this era. Gilbert says every one of the films he made with Danny Angel - six in all - were successful financially.

<text>The St George region of Sydney is part of the southern suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The area includes all the suburbs in the local government area of Georges River Council and the part of Bayside Council which was Rockdale City prior to 2016. This is everything within the boundaries of Salt Pan Creek to the west, The Georges River to the south, Botany Bay to the east and the M5 Motorway and Wolli Creek to the north. This area corresponds to the southern portion of the cadastral Parish of St George, from which the region derives its name and the area was later covered by the St George County Council, the electricity supplier for the councils in this region. This southern portion of the parish below The M5 and Wolli Creek is the more contemporary definition of The St George Region that is considered part of Southern Sydney.

The northern portion of the Parish of St George that&#x27;s north of The M5 and Wolli Creek but south of the Cooks River is considered South-Western Sydney rather than Southern Sydney. This northern portion of the cadastral parish was formerly in the City of Canterbury but now within the amalgamated City of Canterbury-Bankstown. In some instances, the whole cadastral Parish of St George (both north and south) is grouped together and considered the inner south-west due to its geographical location from Sydney CBD.

== History ==
=== Indigenous Australians ===
The first inhabitants of the St George area were Australian Aboriginals. At the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, the Eora tribe inhabited land from Port Jackson to Botany Bay and the Georges River. There is evidence to suggest that these people belonged to the Gweagal, Bidjigal and Cadigal clans.

=== European settlement ===


James Cook sailed HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; into Botany Bay in 1770 for his first landing on the continent of Australia. Captain Arthur Phillip led the First Fleet into the bay on 18 January 1788 to found a penal colony there but found the sandy infertile soil disappointing and moved the site of the settlement north to the natural harbour of Port Jackson. The ridge between the Cooks River and Georges River was covered in a dense forest which first attracted timber cutters to the area. Wood gatherers, bark collectors, sawyers and charcoal burners moved into the area to work the forests of Simeon Lord and supply Sydney&#x27;s timber needs. By the 1840s, Major Mitchell was building the Illawarra Road (now Forest Road) on the ridge through ‘Lord’s Bush’, which required enormous amounts of trees and bush to be cleared. Irishman Michael Gannon was innkeeper at Cooks River in the 1840s. He acquired land in the area, part of which became known as ‘Gannons Forest’ which later was the centre of Hurstville. By 1851, it was estimated that 50 to 100 carts of timber and lime crossed the Cooks River daily.

St George Parish was one of the original parishes within Cumberland County. It is one of nine parishes named after saints, of which only St George and St James are still commonly used as place names. A map of the parish revealed that the land was cut into areas ranging from 30 to and a few large land grants of . The recipients were William Packer, Josh Thorp, James Oatley, Hannah Laycock, F. W. Unwin, Reuben and David Hannam, Patrick Moore, J. Beehag, John Porter and the larger grants were James Chandler and John and Robert Townson. The parish also covers the former City of Canterbury, now the eastern part of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, although most customary references to the &quot;St George area&quot; today do not include that part of the parish.

In 1920, the local councils in the St George area constituted St George County Council, to deal with distribution of electricity in the region. St George County Council was merged with Sydney County Council (another inter-council electricity supplier) to form &quot;Sydney Electricity&quot; in 1989.

The regional identity was reinforced by the creation in 1949 of a federal electorate, the Division of St George, in the area. The Division was abolished in 1993. The area&#x27;s identity is reflected in the name of the St George Illawarra Dragons team who play in the National Rugby League, and the St. George Bank.

== Suburbs in St George Area ==


==Culture and sport==
The St George area is a culturally diverse region. Major centres feature a substantial number of Southern European and Asian migrants and their families.

In terms of sport, the area is known as the home of the St George Illawarra Dragons and the St George District Cricket Club.

==Commercial areas==
The biggest commercial areas in the St George area are located at Hurstville, Kogarah and Rockdale. Hurstville is the largest central business district in southern Sydney and features a large shopping centre called Westfield Hurstville. Additionally Rockdale features another large shopping centre, Rockdale Plaza.

==Transport==
The St. George area is serviced very well by public transport. The Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line, South Coast Line and Airport Line have frequent services to the city directly or via Wolli Creek.

There are also abundant bus routes serving the region operated by Transit Systems and U-Go Mobility.

==Population==
The population of the St George region, as estimated in 2020, was 285,214.

<doc id="1164786" wikidata="Q559615" url="?curid=1164786" title="Shadowboxing">
<text>Shadowboxing is a combat sport exercise in which a person throws punches at the air as though there is an opponent. Practised primarily in boxing, it is used mainly to prepare the muscles before the person training engages in stronger physical activity. Muhammad Ali once performed a now famous shadowboxing routine next to Howard Cosell for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; television cameras. Black Nova Scotian boxer George Dixon is widely credited for developing the technique.

== Details ==
Most boxing trainers prefer that their fighters do their shadow boxing before engaging in any other daily exercise routines. The main purpose of this exercise, apart from getting the muscles ready for another activity, is usually to maintain a fighter&#x27;s rhythm and show the fighter how they would look at that stage of training against a certain opponent. This could be important as fighters envision themselves facing their immediate future opponents: it usually gives fighters an idea of what is, and what is not, to be fixed. It is also beneficial to sometimes incorporate dumbbells&#x27; as you shadow box so punches can flow quicker without them. It is also good to look in a mirror as you shadowbox so you can catch slight errors in your rhythm.

Fighters may want to do some shadowboxing of their own after their daily routines are over, either inside a boxing gym&#x27;s ring, or wherever they please to at home without having to look directly at a mirror.

Each boxing round is 3 minutes and you should not really stop during this workout/routine. Shadowboxing is all about flowing offensively and defensively and it is also important to not throw full punches all the time, it can drain you out before the actual training starts. Once you get the rhythm down then you picture yourself in the fight and react to your invisible opponent.

Shadowboxing is not limited to boxers and fighters. Many fighters from other striking-based martial arts also use the exercise as part of their daily routines and aside from punches and perhaps dependent upon fighting style they will use kicks, knees, elbows, or even throws. Bruce Lee was often seen practicing his kicks in front of a mirror in his films, and he incorporated other concepts from boxing into his Jeet Kune Do style such as footwork and live sparring. Shadowboxing with swords and other weapons, referred to as a floryshe, is a major training tool among Historical European Martial Arts groups such as the Association for Renaissance Martial Arts and the HEMA Alliance.

Fighters of other more grappling-based martial arts also shadowbox as part of their daily training regimen. Freestyle wrestlers also practice many drills simulating specific wrestling moves without the aid of a partner such as shooting, sprawling, hip switches and bridging.

===Styles===
The &quot;long&quot; method involves a shuffle of the feet that rocks the body back and forth. This is a style favored by fighters with long reach, who use more jabs and straight shots.
The &quot;short&quot; method sees the fighter move his head and body to the left and right, constantly slipping punches and moving in for closer body shots. Joe Frazier and Mike Tyson are among the best examples of fighters who use this method.

==In popular culture==
In 2024, baseball player Tommy Pham of the Chicago White Sox shadowboxed after an altercation with William Contreras of the Milwaukee Brewers.

<text>Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) is part of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, a Neolithic culture centered in upper Mesopotamia and the Levant, dating to years ago, that is, 8800–6500 BC. It was typed by British archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon during her archaeological excavations at Jericho in the West Bank, territory of Palestine.

Like the earlier PPNA people, the PPNB culture developed from the Mesolithic Natufian culture. However, it shows evidence of having more northerly origins, possibly indicating an influx from the region of northeastern Anatolia.

== Lifestyle ==
Cultural tendencies of this period differ from that of the earlier Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), in that people living during this phase began to depend more heavily upon domesticated animals to supplement their earlier mixed agrarian and hunter-gatherer diet. In addition, the flint tool kit of the period is new and quite disparate from that of the earlier period. One of its major elements is the core. This is the first period in which architectural styles of the southern Levant became primarily rectilinear; earlier typical dwellings were circular, elliptical and occasionally even octagonal. Pyrotechnology, the expanding capability to control fire, was highly developed in this period. During this period, one of the main features of houses is a thick layer of white clay plaster flooring, highly polished and made of lime produced from limestone.
It is believed that the use of clay plaster for floor and wall coverings during PPNB led to the discovery of pottery. The earliest proto-pottery was White Ware vessels, made from lime and gray ash, built up around baskets before firing, for several centuries around 7000 BC at sites such as Tell Neba&#x27;a Faour (Beqaa Valley). Sites from this period found in the Levant utilizing rectangular floor plans and plastered floor techniques were found at Ain Ghazal, Yiftahel (western Galilee), and Abu Hureyra (Upper Euphrates). The period is dated to between c. 10,700 and c. 8,000 BP or 8,700–6,000 BC.

Plastered human skulls were reconstructed human skulls that were made in the ancient Levant between 9000 and 6000 BC in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period. They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the Middle East and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their ancestors below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of portraiture in the history of art.

== Society ==

Danielle Stordeur&#x27;s recent work at Tell Aswad, a large agricultural village between Mount Hermon and Damascus could not validate Henri de Contenson&#x27;s earlier suggestion of a PPNA &quot;Aswadian&quot; culture. Instead, they found evidence of a fully established PPNB culture at 8700 BC at Aswad, pushing back the period&#x27;s generally accepted start date by 1,200 years. Similar sites to Tell Aswad in the Damascus Basin of the same age were found at Tell Ramad and Tell Ghoraifé. How a PPNB culture could spring up in this location, practicing domesticated farming from 8700 BC has been the subject of speculation. Whether it created its own culture or imported traditions from the North East or Southern Levant has been considered an important question for a site that poses a problem for the scientific community.

== Extent ==
Work at the site of &#x27;Ain Ghazal in Jordan has indicated a later Pre-Pottery Neolithic C period, which existed between 8,200 and 7,900 BP. Juris Zarins has proposed that a Circum Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex developed in the period from the climatic crisis of 6200 BC, partly as a result of an increasing emphasis in PPNB cultures upon animal domesticates, and a fusion with Harifian hunter gatherers in Southern Palestine, with affiliate connections with the cultures of Fayyum and the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Cultures practicing this lifestyle spread down the Red Sea shoreline and moved east from Syria into southern Iraq.

The culture disappeared during the 8.2 kiloyear event, a term that climatologists have adopted for a sudden decrease in global temperatures that occurred approximately 8,200 years before the present, or c. 6200 BC, and which lasted for the next two to four centuries. In the following Munhatta and Yarmukian post-pottery Neolithic cultures that succeeded it, rapid cultural development continues, although PPNB culture continued in the Amuq valley, where it influenced the later development of the Ghassulian culture.

== Artifacts ==
Around 8000 BC, before the invention of pottery, several early settlements became experts in crafting beautiful and highly sophisticated containers from stone, using materials such as alabaster or granite, and employing sand to shape and polish. Artisans used the veins in the material to maximum visual effect. Such objects have been found in abundance on the upper Euphrates river, in what is today eastern Syria, especially at the site of Bouqras. These form the early stages of the development of the art of Mesopotamia.
== Genetics ==

Pre-Pottery Neolithic B fossils that were analysed for uniparentals via ancient DNA, were found to carry the Y-DNA (paternal) haplogroups E1b1b (2/7; ~29%), CT (2/7; ~29%), E(xE2,E1a,E1b1a1a1c2c3b1,E1b1b1b1a1,E1b1b1b2b) (1/7; ~14%), T(xT1a1,T1a2a) (1/7; ~14%), and H2 (1/7; ~14%). The CT clade was also observed in a Pre-Pottery Neolithic C specimen (1/1; 100%). Maternally, the rare basal haplogroup N* has been found among skeletal remains belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, as have the mtDNA clades L3 and K.

DNA analysis has also confirmed ancestral ties between the Pre-Pottery Neolithic culture bearers and the makers of the Epipaleolithic Iberomaurusian culture of North Africa, the Mesolithic Natufian culture of the Levant, the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic culture of East Africa, the Early Neolithic Cardium culture of Morocco, and the Ancient Egyptian culture of the Nile Valley, with fossils associated with these early cultures all sharing a common genomic West Eurasian/Near-Eastern component. A paper from 2021 would find that the Mesolithic Natufians cluster the closest with modern Saudi Arabians, Desert Bedouins and Yemenis. The Natufians were also close to, and ancestral to the ancient Levant PPNB/C and the later Levantine Bronze Age samples.

Mathieson et al. (2015) &amp; Lazardis et al. (2016), discovered that the Levant Neolithic samples from PPNB to PPNC were a mix of a component related to Natufians, and another lineage related to Anatolian farmers from Barcin and Mentese. In another study from 2021, the populations of the PPNB Levant were modelled as having 60.5% Israel Natufian Epipaleolithic related ancestry, and 39.5% Turkey Barcin Neolithic ancestry. Later, geneticists in 2022 using 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), discovered that the ancient DNA of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic of Mesopotamia and Anatolia, showed that these populations were formed through admixture of pre-Neolithic sources related to Anatolian, Caucasus, and Levantine hunter-gatherers.

Altınışık, N Ezgi et al. (2022) studied 13 genomes from the PPNB at Cayonu, Turkey, and found they were formed by an admixture event between western and eastern populations of early Holocene Southwest Asia. 

In 2023, Xiaoran Wang and team found that their six genetically analyzed PPNB individuals, were having ancestry from Levantine Epipaleolithic, Anatolian Neolithic, Iranian Neolithic, and Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers. The PPNB in general exhibited strong evidence of gene flow from populations related to Anatolia compared to the earlier Natufian hunter-gatherers. PPN individuals from Ain Ghazal further to the north in Jordan had a stronger genetic affinity with Anatolia than the PPN of Ba&#x27;ja, although not significantly so.

== Diffusion ==
=== Carbon-14 dating ===
The spread of the Neolithic in Europe was first studied quantitatively in the 1970s, when a sufficient number of 14C age determinations for early Neolithic sites had become available. Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza discovered a linear relationship between the age of an Early Neolithic site and its distance from the conventional source in the Near East (Jericho), thus demonstrating that, on average, the Neolithic spread at a constant speed of about 1 km/yr. More recent studies confirm these results and yield the speed of 0.6–1.3 km/yr at 95% confidence level.

=== Analysis of mitochondrial DNA ===
Since the original human expansions out of Africa 200,000 years ago, different prehistoric and historic migration events have taken place in Europe. Considering that the movement of the people implies a consequent movement of their genes, it is possible to estimate the impact of these migrations through the genetic analysis of human populations. Agricultural and husbandry practices originated 10,000 years ago in a region of the Near East known as the Fertile Crescent. According to the archaeological record this phenomenon, known as &quot;Neolithic&quot;, rapidly expanded from these territories into Europe. However, whether this diffusion was accompanied or not by human migrations is greatly debated. Mitochondrial DNA – a type of maternally inherited DNA located in the cell cytoplasm- was recovered from the remains of Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farmers in the Near East and then compared to available data from other Neolithic populations in Europe and also to modern populations from South Eastern Europe and the Near East. The obtained results show that substantial human migrations were involved in the Neolithic spread and suggest that the first Neolithic farmers entered Europe following a maritime route through Cyprus and the Aegean Islands.

<text>Moscow Time (MSK, ) is the time zone for the city of Moscow, Russia, and most of western Russia, including Saint Petersburg. It is the second-westernmost of the eleven time zones of Russia. It has been set to UTC+03:00 without DST since 26 October 2014; before that date it had been set to UTC+04:00 year-round on 27 March 2011.

Moscow Time is used to schedule trains, ships, etc. throughout Russia, but airplane travel is scheduled using local time. Times in Russia are often announced throughout the country on radio stations as Moscow Time, which is also registered in telegrams, etc. Descriptions of time zones in Russia are often based on Moscow Time rather than UTC. For example, Yakutsk (UTC+09:00) is said to be MSK+6 in Russia.

== History ==
Until the October Revolution, the official time in Moscow corresponded to GMT+02:30:17 (according to the longitude of the Astronomical Observatory of Moscow State University). In 1919 the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the RSFSR introduced the system of time zones in the country, and Moscow was assigned to the second administrative time zone, which was equal to GMT+02:00. Other zones east of the 37.5° meridian to Arkhangelsk, Vologda, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Vladimir, Ryazan, Tula, Lipetsk, Voronezh and Rostov-on-Don were also included in the second belt.

In accordance with the 16 June 1930 Decree of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars, the Decree Time was introduced by adding one hour to the time in each time zone of the USSR, so that Moscow Time became three hours ahead of Universal Time.

Until 2011, during the winter, between the last Sunday of October and the last Sunday of March, &quot;Moscow Standard Time (MSK, МСК)&quot; was three hours ahead of UTC, or UTC+03:00. In the summer, Moscow Time shifted forward an additional hour ahead of Moscow Standard Time to become &quot;Moscow Summer Time (MSD)&quot;, making it UTC+04:00.

In 2011, the Russian government proclaimed that daylight saving time would in future be observed all year round, thus effectively displacing standard time—an action which the government claimed emerged from health concerns attributed to the annual shift back-and-forth between standard time and daylight saving time. On 27 March 2011, Muscovites set their clocks forward for a final time, effectively observing MSD, or UTC+04:00, permanently.

On 29 March 2014, after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol—two federal subjects established by Russia on the Crimean Peninsula—switched their time to MSK on 30 March 2014 (from UTC+02:00 with DST to UTC+04:00 with permanent DST) and then when permanent DST in Russia was removed on 26 October 2014 the time became UTC+03:00 without DST all year.

On 1 July 2014, the State Duma passed a bill partially repealing the 2011 change, putting Moscow Time on permanent UTC+03:00 and thus back to standard time.

== Usage ==
Most of the European part of Russia (west of the Ural Mountains) uses Moscow Time. In Kaliningrad Oblast, Kaliningrad time (UTC+02:00) is used. Samara Oblast and Udmurtia use Samara time (UTC+04:00) and Perm Krai, Bashkortostan and Orenburg Oblast use Yekaterinburg time (UTC+05:00). Since 2014, Moscow Time has been observed in Crimea after it was annexed and in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, including after their declared annexation in 2022.

=== Past usage ===
Prior to 26 October 2014, Moscow Time was UTC+03:00. Daylight saving time was used in the summer, advancing it to UTC+04:00.

UTC+03:00 was also formerly used in European parts of what was then the USSR:

* between 1989 and 1991 and in 2010 in Samara Oblast.

In 1922–1930 and 1991–1992, Moscow observed Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00). Daylight saving time (UTC+03:00) was observed in the summer of 1991, and the city and region reverted to UTC+03:00 by the summer of 1992.

The time in Moscow has been as follows (the following list of DST usage may not be accurate):
== Anomalies ==
Since political, in addition to purely geographical, criteria are used in the drawing of time zones, it follows that time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines. The MSK (UTC+03:00) time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 37°30&#x27; E and 52°30&#x27; E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a &quot;physical&quot; UTC+03:00 time, are in another time zone; likewise, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+03:00, even though their &quot;physical&quot; time zone is different from that. Following is a list of such anomalies:

Areas located outside UTC+03:00 longitudes using Moscow Time (UTC+03:00) time

Areas west of 37°30&#x27; E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+02:00) that use UTC+03:00
* The entirety of Belarus with 23°10&#x27; E as the westernmost point where MSK is used
* Western Russia, including Saint Petersburg, half of Moscow and Crimea

Areas between 52°30&#x27; E and 67°30&#x27; E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+04:00) that use UTC+03:00
* Russia, including most of Franz Josef Land, Yuzhny Island, most of Severny Island with an exception to the very east, and some parts of the Russian mainland (Komi Republic, Nenets Autonomous Okrug, east of Kirov Oblast and Tatarstan)

Areas east of 67°30&#x27; E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+05:00) that use UTC+03:00
* The very east of Severny Island in Russia with 69°2&#x27; E as the easternmost point where MSK is used

<doc id="1164794" wikidata="Q928521" url="?curid=1164794" title="Microburin">
<text>A microburin is a characteristic waste product from manufacture of lithic tools — sometimes confused with an authentic burin — which is characteristic of the Mesolithic, but which has been recorded from the end of the Upper Paleolithic until the Chalcolithic. This type of lithic artifact was first named by Henri Breuil who defined it as &quot;a type of angular, smooth, with a terminal retouch in the form of a small notch&quot;. Breuil initially thought that the microburins had a functional use as a type of microlithic burin. However, he later came to realize that the manufacturing technique was different from that of the burin and that they could be waste products from the manufacture of microliths, but they may have occasionally been reused for a useful purpose, which is expected for parsimonious lithic resource exploitation 

A microburin is a fragment of a lithic flake, or more precisely, of a lithic blade, that shows on its upper face the beginnings of a notch terminating in an oblique flection (whose surface can only be seen from the lower side) that ends in a very acute trihedral apex. It was thought that microburins were exclusively a class of functional microliths, but knapping experiments, along with the refitting of contiguous pieces, have demonstrated that they are a characteristic waste product of an advanced lithic reduction process known as microburin technique - or more correctly, microburin blow technique, following a study of thousands of microburins originating from a variety of 
Saharan sites. Jacques Tixier noted that none of the examples studied showed unambiguous traces of intentional use, which also validates observation of lack of use wear from analysis of European pieces.
Examples found in Europe can be seen on this page : https://web.archive.org/web/20090131231751/http://archeobase.be/page_microburins_meso.html, which are associated with Mesolithic hunters of Wallonia (Belgium) (approximately 9,000 BP).

There is also a particular type of microburin named after Krukowski that is from a &quot;carving accident&quot; and not a waste byproduct.

<doc id="1164809" wikidata="Q1542432" url="?curid=1164809" title="Greenland ice sheet">
<text>The Greenland ice sheet is an ice sheet which forms the second largest body of ice in the world. It is an average of thick and over thick at its maximum. It is almost long in a north–south direction, with a maximum width of at a latitude of 77°N, near its northern edge. The ice sheet covers , around 80% of the surface of Greenland, or about 12% of the area of the Antarctic ice sheet. The term &#x27;Greenland ice sheet&#x27; is often shortened to GIS or GrIS in scientific literature.

Greenland has had major glaciers and ice caps for at least 18 million years, but a single ice sheet first covered most of the island some 2.6 million years ago. Since then, it has both grown and contracted significantly. The oldest known ice on Greenland is about 1 million years old. Due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, the ice sheet is now the warmest it has been in the past 1000 years, and is losing ice at the fastest rate in at least the past 12,000 years.

Every summer, parts of the surface melt and ice cliffs calve into the sea. Normally the ice sheet would be replenished by winter snowfall, but due to global warming the ice sheet is melting two to five times faster than before 1850, and snowfall has not kept up since 1996. If the Paris Agreement goal of staying below is achieved, melting of Greenland ice alone would still add around to global sea level rise by the end of the century. If there are no reductions in emissions, melting would add around by 2100, with a worst-case of about . For comparison, melting has so far contributed since 1972, while sea level rise from all sources was between 1901 and 2018.

If all of the ice sheet were to melt, it would increase global sea levels by ~. Global warming between and would likely make this melting inevitable. However, would still cause ice loss equivalent to of sea level rise, and more ice will be lost if the temperatures exceed that level before declining. If global temperatures continue to rise, the ice sheet will likely disappear within 10,000 years. At very high warming, its future lifetime goes down to around 1,000 years.
Beneath the Greenland ice sheet are mountains and lake basins.

==Description ==

Ice sheets form through a process of glaciation, when the local climate is sufficiently cold that snow is able to accumulate from year to year. As the annual snow layers pile up, their weight gradually compresses the deeper levels of snow to firn and then to solid glacier ice over hundreds of years. Once the ice sheet formed in Greenland, its size remained similar to its current state. However, there have been 11 periods in Greenland&#x27;s history when the ice sheet extended up to beyond its current boundaries; with the last one around 1 million years ago.

The weight of the ice causes it to slowly &quot;flow&quot;, unless it is stopped by a sufficiently large obstacle, such as a mountain. Greenland has many mountains near its coastline, which normally prevent the ice sheet from flowing further into the Arctic Ocean. The 11 previous episodes of glaciation are notable because the ice sheet grew large enough to flow over those mountains. Nowadays, the northwest and southeast margins of the ice sheet are the main areas where there are sufficient gaps in the mountains to enable the ice sheet to flow out to the ocean through outlet glaciers. These glaciers regularly shed ice in what is known as ice calving. Sediment released from calved and melting ice sinks accumulates on the seafloor, and sediment cores from places such as the Fram Strait provide long records of glaciation at Greenland.

== Geological history ==

While there is evidence of large glaciers in Greenland for most of the past 18 million years, these ice bodies were probably similar to various smaller modern examples, such as Maniitsoq and Flade Isblink, which cover around the periphery. Conditions in Greenland were not initially suitable for a single coherent ice sheet to develop, but this began to change around 10 million years ago, during the middle Miocene, when the two passive continental margins which now form the uplands of West and East Greenland experienced uplift, and ultimately formed the upper planation surface at a height of 2000 to 3000 meter above sea level.

Later uplift, during the Pliocene, formed a lower planation surface at 500 to 1000 meters above sea level. A third stage of uplift created multiple valleys and fjords below the planation surfaces. This uplift intensified glaciation due to increased orographic precipitation and cooler surface temperatures, allowing ice to accumulate and persist. As recently as 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene warm period, Greenland&#x27;s ice was limited to the highest peaks in the east and the south. Ice cover gradually expanded since then, until the atmospheric CO2 levels dropped to between 280 and 320 ppm 2.7–2.6 million years ago, by which time temperatures had dropped sufficiently for the disparate ice caps to connect and cover most of the island.

=== Ice cores and sediment samples ===

The base of the ice sheet may be warm enough due to geothermal activity to have liquid water beneath it. This liquid water, under pressure from the weight of ice above it, may cause erosion, eventually leaving nothing but bedrock below the ice sheet. However, there are parts of the Greenland ice sheet, near the summit, where the ice sheet slides over a basal layer of ice which had frozen solid to the ground, preserving ancient soil, which can then be recovered by drilling. The oldest such soil was continuously covered by ice for around 2.7 million years, while another, deep ice core from the summit has revealed ice that is around ~1,000,000 years old.

Sediment samples from the Labrador Sea provide evidence that nearly all of the south Greenland ice had melted around 400,000 years ago, during Marine Isotope Stage 11. Other ice core samples from Camp Century in northwestern Greenland, show that the ice there melted at least once during the past 1.4 million years, during the Pleistocene, and did not return for at least 280,000 years. These findings suggest that less than 10% of the current ice sheet volume was left during those geologically recent periods, when the temperatures were less than warmer than preindustrial conditions. This contradicts how climate models typically simulate the continuous presence of solid ice under those conditions. Analysis of the ~100,000-year records obtained from long ice cores drilled between 1989 and 1993 into the summit of Greenland&#x27;s ice sheet, had provided evidence for geologically rapid changes in climate, and informed research on tipping points such as in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC).

Ice cores provide valuable information about the past states of the ice sheet, and other kinds of paleoclimate data. Subtle differences in the oxygen isotope composition of the water molecules in ice cores can reveal important information about the water cycle at the time, while air bubbles frozen within the ice core provide a snapshot of the gas and particulate composition of the atmosphere through time. When properly analyzed, ice cores provide a wealth of proxies suitable for reconstructing the past temperature record, precipitation patterns, volcanic eruptions, solar variation, ocean primary production, and even changes in soil vegetation cover and the associated wildfire frequency. The ice cores from Greenland also record human impact, such as lead production during the time of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire.

== Recent melting ==
From the 1960s to the 1980s an area in the North Atlantic which included southern Greenland was one of the few locations in the world which showed cooling rather than warming. This location was relatively warmer in the 1930s and 1940s than in the decades immediately before or after. More complete data sets have established trends of warming and ice loss starting from 1900(well after the start of the Industrial Revolution and its impact on global carbon dioxide levels) and a trend of strong warming starting around 1979, in line with concurrent observed Arctic sea ice decline. In 1995–
1999, central Greenland was already warmer than it was in the 1950s. Between 1991 and 2004, average winter temperature at one location, Swiss Camp, rose almost .

Consistent with this warming, the 1970s were the last decade when the Greenland ice sheet grew, gaining about 47 gigatonnes per year. From 1980–1990 there was an average annual mass loss of ~51 Gt/y. The period 1990–2000 showed an average annual loss of 41 Gt/y, with 1996 being the last year the Greenland ice sheet saw net mass gain. As of 2022, the Greenland ice sheet had been losing ice for 26 years in a row, and temperatures there had been the highest in the entire past last millennium – about warmer than the 20th century average.

Several factors determine the net rate of ice sheet growth or decline. These are:

* Accumulation and melting rates of snow in and around the centre
* Melting of ice along the sheet&#x27;s margins
* Ice calving into the sea from outlet glaciers also along the sheet&#x27;s edges

When the IPCC Third Assessment Report was published in 2001, the analysis of observations to date had shown that the ice accumulation of 520 ± 26 gigatonnes per year was offset by runoff and bottom melting equivalent to ice losses of 297±32 Gt/yr and 32±3 Gt/yr, and iceberg production of 235±33 Gt/yr, with a net loss of −44 ± 53 gigatonnes per year.

Annual ice losses from the Greenland ice sheet accelerated in the 2000s, reaching ~187 Gt/yr in 2000–2010, and an average mass loss during 2010–2018 of 286 Gt per year. Half of the ice sheet&#x27;s observed net loss (3,902 gigatons (Gt) of ice between 1992 and 2018, or approximately 0.13% of its total mass) happened during those 8 years. When converted to sea level rise equivalent, the Greenland ice sheet contributed about 13.7 mm since 1972.

Between 2012 and 2017, it contributed 0.68 mm per year, compared to 0.07 mm per year between 1992 and 1997. Greenland&#x27;s net contribution for the 2012–2016 period was equivalent to 37% of sea level rise from &quot;land ice&quot; sources (excluding thermal expansion). These melt rates are comparable to the largest experienced by the ice sheet over the past 12,000 years.
Currently, the Greenland ice sheet loses more mass every year than the Antarctic ice sheet, because of its position in the Arctic, where it is subject to intense regional amplification of warming. Ice losses from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet have been accelerating due to its vulnerable Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers, and the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise is expected to overtake that of Greenland later this century.

===Observed glacier retreat===
Retreat of outlet glaciers as they shed ice into the Arctic is a large factor in the decline of Greenland&#x27;s ice sheet. Estimates suggest that losses from glaciers explain between 49% and 66.8% of observed ice loss since the 1980s. Net loss of ice was already observed across 70% of the ice sheet margins by the 1990s, with thinning detected as the glaciers started to lose height. Between 1998 and 2006, thinning occurred four times faster for coastal glaciers compared to the early 1990s, falling at rates between and per year, while the landlocked glaciers experienced almost no such acceleration.

One of the most dramatic examples of thinning was in the southeast, at Kangerlussuaq Glacier. It is over long, wide and around thick, which makes it the third largest glacier in Greenland. Between 1993 and 1998, parts of the glacier within of the coast lost in height. Its observed ice flow speed went from per year in 1988–1995 to per year in 2005, which was then the fastest known flow of any glacier. The retreat of Kangerlussuaq slowed down by 2008, and showed some recovery until 2016–2018, when more rapid ice loss occurred.

Greenland&#x27;s other major outlet glaciers have also experienced rapid change in recent decades. Its single largest outlet glacier is Jacobshavn Isbræ () in west Greenland, which has been observed by glaciologists for many decades. It historically sheds ice from 6.5% of the ice sheet (compared to 4% for Kangerlussuaq), at speeds of ~ per day. While it lost enough ice to retreat around between 1850 and 1964, its mass gain increased sufficiently to keep it in balance for the next 35 years, only to switch to rapid mass loss after 1997. By 2003, the average annual ice flow speed had almost doubled since 1997, as the ice tongue in front of the glacier disintegrated, and the glacier shed of ice between 2001 and 2005. The ice flow reached per day in 2012, but slowed down substantially afterwards, and showed mass gain between 2016 and 2019.

Northern Greenland&#x27;s Petermann Glacier is smaller in absolute terms, but experienced some of the most rapid degradation in recent decades. It lost of floating ice in 2000–2001, followed by a iceberg breaking off in 2008, and then a iceberg calving from ice shelf in August 2010. This became the largest Arctic iceberg since 1962, and amounted to a quarter of the shelf&#x27;s size. In July 2012, Petermann glacier lost another major iceberg, measuring , or twice the area of Manhattan. As of 2023, the glacier&#x27;s ice shelf had lost around 40% of its pre-2010 state, and it is considered unlikely to recover from further ice loss.

In the early 2010s, some estimates suggested that tracking the largest glaciers would be sufficient to account for most of the ice loss. However, glacier dynamics can be hard to predict, as shown by the ice sheet&#x27;s second largest glacier, Helheim Glacier. Its ice loss culminated in rapid retreat in 2005, associated with a marked increase in glacial earthquakes between 1993 and 2005. Since then, it has remained comparatively stable near its 2005 position, losing relatively little mass in comparison to Jacobshavn and Kangerlussuaq, although it may have eroded sufficiently to experience another rapid retreat in the near future. Meanwhile, smaller glaciers have been consistently losing mass at an accelerating rate, and later research has concluded that total glacier retreat is underestimated unless the smaller glaciers are accounted for. By 2023, the rate of ice loss across Greenland&#x27;s coasts had doubled in the two decades since 2000, in large part due to the accelerated losses from smaller glaciers.

=== Processes accelerating glacier retreat ===

Since the early 2000s, glaciologists have concluded that glacier retreat in Greenland is accelerating too quickly to be explained by a linear increase in melting in response to greater surface temperatures alone, and that additional mechanisms must also be at work. Rapid calving events at the largest glaciers match what was first described as the &quot;Jacobshavn effect&quot; in 1986: thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing friction that would otherwise impede its retreat, and resulting in a force imbalance at the calving front, with an increase in velocity spread across the mass of the glacier. The overall acceleration of Jacobshavn Isbrae and other glaciers from 1997 onwards had been attributed to the warming of North Atlantic waters which melt the glacier fronts from underneath. While this warming had been going on since the 1950s, 1997 also saw a shift in circulation which brought relatively warmer currents from the Irminger Sea into closer contact with the glaciers of West Greenland. By 2016, waters across much of West Greenland&#x27;s coastline had warmed by relative to 1990s, and some of the smaller glaciers were losing more ice to such melting than normal calving processes, leading to rapid retreat.

Conversely, Jacobshavn Isbrae is sensitive to changes in ocean temperature as it experiences elevated exposure through a deep subglacial trench. This sensitivity meant that an influx of cooler ocean water to its location was responsible for its slowdown after 2015, in large part because the sea ice and icebergs immediately off-shore were able to survive for longer, and thus helped to stabilize the glacier. Likewise, the rapid retreat and then slowdown of Helheim and Kangerdlugssuaq has also been connected to the respective warming and cooling of nearby currents. At Petermann Glacier, the rapid rate of retreat has been linked to the topography of its grounding line, which appears to shift back and forth by around a kilometer with the tide. It has been suggested that if similar processes can occur at the other glaciers, then their eventual rate of mass loss could be doubled.

There are several ways in which increased melting at the surface of the ice sheet can accelerate lateral retreat of outlet glaciers. Firstly, the increase in meltwater at the surface causes larger amounts to flow through the ice sheet down to bedrock via moulins. There, it lubricates the base of the glaciers and generates higher basal pressure, which collectively reduces friction and accelerates glacial motion, including the rate of ice calving. This mechanism was observed at Sermeq Kujalleq in 1998 and 1999, where flow increased by up to 20% for two to three months. However, some research suggests that this mechanism only applies to certain small glaciers, rather than to the largest outlet glaciers, and may have only a marginal impact on ice loss trends.

Secondly, once meltwater flows into the ocean, it can still impact the glaciers by interacting with ocean water and altering its local circulation - even in the absence of any ocean warming. In certain fjords, large meltwater flows from beneath the ice may mix with ocean water to create turbulent plumes that can be damaging to the calving front. While the models generally consider the impact from meltwater run-off as secondary to ocean warming, observations of 13 glaciers found that meltwater plumes play a greater role for glaciers with shallow grounding lines. Further, 2022 research suggests that the warming from plumes had a greater impact on underwater melting across northwest Greenland.

Finally, it has been shown that meltwater can also flow through cracks that are too small to be picked up by most research tools - only wide. Such cracks do not connect to bedrock through the entire ice sheet but may still reach several hundred meters down from the surface. Their presence is important, as it weakens the ice sheet, conducts more heat directly through the ice, and allows it to flow faster. This recent research is not currently captured in models. One of the scientists behind these findings, Alun Hubbard, described finding moulins where &quot;current scientific understanding doesn’t accommodate&quot; their presence, because it disregards how they may develop from hairline cracks in the absence of existing large crevasses that are normally thought to be necessary for their formation.

===Observed surface melting===

Currently, the total accumulation of ice on the surface of Greenland ice sheet is larger than either outlet glacier losses individually or surface melting during the summer, and it is the combination of both which causes net annual loss. For instance, the ice sheet&#x27;s interior thickened by an average of each year between 1994 and 2005, in part due to a phase of North Atlantic oscillation increasing snowfall. Every summer, a so-called snow line separates the ice sheet&#x27;s surface into areas above it, where snow continues to accumulate even then, with the areas below the line where summer melting occurs. The exact position of the snow line moves around every summer, and if it moves away from some areas it covered the previous year, then those tend to experience substantially greater melt as their darker ice is exposed. Uncertainty about the snow line is one of the factors making it hard to predict each melting season in advance.

A notable example of ice accumulation rates above the snow line is provided by &quot;Glacier Girl&quot;, a Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighter plane which had crashed early in World War II and was recovered in 1992, by which point it had been buried under of ice. Another example occurred in 2017, when an Airbus A380 had to make an emergency landing in Canada after one of its jet engines exploded while it was above Greenland; the engine&#x27;s massive air intake fan was recovered from the ice sheet two years later, when it was already buried beneath of ice and snow.

While summer surface melting has been increasing, it is still expected that it will be decades before melting will consistently exceed snow accumulation on its own. It is also hypothesized that the increase in global precipitation associated with the effects of climate change on the water cycle could increase snowfall over Greenland, and thus further delay this transition. This hypothesis was difficult to test in the 2000s due to the poor state of long-term precipitation records over the ice sheet. By 2019, it was found that while there was an increase in snowfall over southwest Greenland, there had been a substantial decrease in precipitation over western Greenland as a whole. Further, more precipitation in the northwest had been falling as rain instead of snow, with a fourfold increase in rain since 1980. Rain is warmer than snow and forms darker and less thermally insulating ice layer once it does freeze on the ice sheet. It is particularly damaging when it falls due to late-summer cyclones, whose increasing occurrence has been overlooked by the earlier models. There has also been an increase in water vapor, which paradoxically increases melting by making it easier for heat to radiate downwards through moist, as opposed to dry, air.

Altogether, the melt zone below the snow line, where summer warmth turns snow and ice into slush and melt ponds, has been expanding at an accelerating rate since the beginning of detailed measurements in 1979. By 2002, its area was found to have increased by 16% since 1979, and the annual melting season broke all previous records. Another record was set in July 2012, when the melt zone extended to 97% of the ice sheet&#x27;s cover, and the ice sheet lost approximately 0.1% of its total mass (2900 Gt) during that year&#x27;s melting season, with the net loss (464 Gt) setting another record. It became the first directly observed example of a &quot;massive melting event&quot;, when the melting took place across practically the entire ice sheet surface, rather than specific areas. That event led to the counterintuitive discovery that cloud cover, which normally results in cooler temperature due to their albedo, actually interferes with meltwater refreezing in the firn layer at night, which can increase total meltwater runoff by over 30%. Thin, water-rich clouds have the worst impact, and they were the most prominent in July 2012.

Ice cores had shown that the last time a melting event of the same magnitude as in 2012 took place was in 1889, and some glaciologists had expressed hope that 2012 was part of a 150-year cycle. This was disproven in summer 2019, when a combination of high temperatures and unsuitable cloud cover led to an even larger mass melting event, which ultimately covered over at its greatest extent. Predictably, 2019 set a new record of 586 Gt net mass loss. In July 2021, another record mass melting event occurred. At its peak, it covered , and led to daily ice losses of 88 Gt across several days. High temperatures continued in August 2021, with the melt extent staying at . At that time, rain fell for 13 hours at Greenland&#x27;s Summit Station, located at elevation. Researchers had no rain gauges to measure the rainfall, because temperatures at the summit have risen above freezing only three times since 1989 and it had never rained there before.

Due to the enormous thickness of the central Greenland ice sheet, even the most extensive melting event can only affect a small fraction of it before the start of the freezing season, and so they are considered &quot;short-term variability&quot; in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, their existence is important: the fact that the current models underestimate the extent and frequency of such events is considered to be one of the main reasons why the observed ice sheet decline in Greenland and Antarctica tracks the worst-case rather than the moderate scenarios of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report&#x27;s sea-level rise projections. Some of the most recent scientific projections of Greenland melt now include an extreme scenario where a massive melting event occurs every year across the studied period (i.e. every year between now and 2100 or between now and 2300), to illustrate that such a hypothetical future would greatly increase ice loss, but still wouldn&#x27;t melt the entire ice sheet within the study period.

=== Changes in albedo ===
On the ice sheet, annual temperatures are generally substantially lower than elsewhere in Greenland: about at the south dome (latitudes 63°–65°N) and near the center of the north dome (latitude 72°N (the fourth highest &quot;summit&quot; of Greenland). On 22 December 1991, a temperature of was recorded at an automatic weather station near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, making it the lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere. The record went unnoticed for more than 28 years and was finally recognized in 2020. These low temperatures are in part caused by the high albedo of the ice sheet, as its bright white surface is very effective at reflecting sunlight. Ice-albedo feedback means that as the temperatures increase, this causes more ice to melt and either reveal bare ground or even just to form darker melt ponds, both of which act to reduce albedo, which accelerates the warming and contributes to further melting. This is taken into account by the climate models, which estimate that a total loss of the ice sheet would increase global temperature by , while Greenland&#x27;s local temperatures would increase by between and .

Even incomplete melting already has some impact on the ice-albedo feedback. Besides the formation of darker melt ponds, warmer temperatures enable increasing growth of algae on the ice sheet&#x27;s surface. Mats of algae are darker in colour than the surface of the ice, so they absorb more thermal radiation and increase the rate of ice melt. In 2018, it was found that the regions covered in dust, soot, and living microbes and algae altogether grew by 12% between 2000 and 2012. In 2020, it was demonstrated that the presence of algae, which is not accounted for by ice sheet models unlike soot and dust, had already been increasing annual melting by 10–13%. Additionally, as the ice sheet slowly gets lower due to melting, surface temperatures begin to increase and it becomes harder for snow to accumulate and turn to ice, in what is known as surface-elevation feedback.
=== Geophysical and biochemical role of Greenland&#x27;s meltwater ===

Even in 1993, Greenland&#x27;s melt resulted in 300 cubic kilometers of fresh meltwater entering the seas annually, which was substantially larger than the liquid meltwater input from the Antarctic ice sheet, and equivalent to 0.7% of freshwater entering the oceans from all of the world&#x27;s rivers. This meltwater is not pure, and contains a range of elements - most notably iron, about half of which (around 0.3 million tons every year) is bioavailable as a nutrient for phytoplankton. Thus, meltwater from Greenland enhances ocean primary production, both in the local fjords, and further out in the Labrador Sea, where 40% of the total primary production had been attributed to nutrients from meltwater.

Since the 1950s, the acceleration of Greenland melt caused by climate change has already been increasing productivity in waters off the North Icelandic Shelf, while productivity in Greenland&#x27;s fjords is also higher than it had been at any point in the historical record, which spans from late 19th century to present. Some research suggests that Greenland&#x27;s meltwater mainly benefits marine productivity not by adding carbon and iron, but through stirring up lower water layers that are rich in nitrates and thus bringing more of those nutrients to phytoplankton on the surface. As the outlet glaciers retreat inland, the meltwater will be less able to impact the lower layers, which implies that benefit from the meltwater will diminish even as its volume grows.

The impact of meltwater from Greenland goes beyond nutrient transport. For instance, meltwater also contains dissolved organic carbon, which comes from the microbial activity on the ice sheet&#x27;s surface, and, to a lesser extent, from the remnants of ancient soil and vegetation beneath the ice. There is about 0.5-27 billion tonnes of pure carbon underneath the entire ice sheet, and much less within it. This is much less than the 1400–1650 billion tonnes contained within the Arctic permafrost, or the annual anthropogenic emissions of around 40 billion tonnes of .) Yet, the release of this carbon through meltwater can still act as a climate change feedback if it increases overall carbon dioxide emissions.

There is one known area, at Russell Glacier, where meltwater carbon is released into the atmosphere in the form of methane (see arctic methane emissions), which has a much larger global warming potential than carbon dioxide. However, the area also harbours large numbers of methanotrophic bacteria, which limit those methane emissions.

In 2021, research claimed that there must be mineral deposits of mercury (a highly toxic heavy metal) beneath the southwestern ice sheet, because of the exceptional concentrations in meltwater entering the local fjords. If confirmed, these concentrations would have equalled up to 10% of mercury in all of the world&#x27;s rivers. In 2024, a follow-up study found only &quot;very low&quot; concentrations in meltwater from 21 locations. It concluded that the 2021 findings were best explained by accidental sample contamination with mercury(II) chloride, used by the first team of researchers as a reagent. However, there is still a risk of toxic waste being released from Camp Century, formerly a United States military site built to carry nuclear weapons for the Project Iceworm. The project was cancelled, but the site was never cleaned up, and it now threatens to pollute the meltwater with nuclear waste, 20,000 liters of chemical waste and 24 million liters of untreated sewage as the melt progresses. 

Finally, increased quantities of fresh meltwater can affect ocean circulation. Some scientists have connected this increased discharge from Greenland with the so-called cold blob in the North Atlantic, which is in turn connected to Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, and its apparent slowdown. In 2016, a study attempted to improve forecasts of future AMOC changes by incorporating better simulation of Greenland trends into projections from eight state-of-the-art climate models. That research found that by 2090–2100, the AMOC would weaken by around 18% (with a range of potential weakening between 3% and 34%) under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, which is most akin to the current trajectory, while it would weaken by 37% (with a range between 15% and 65%) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, which assumes continually increasing emissions. If the two scenarios are extended past 2100, then the AMOC ultimately stabilizes under RCP 4.5, but it continues to decline under RCP 8.5: the average decline by 2290–2300 is 74%, and there is 44% likelihood of an outright collapse in that scenario, with a wide range of adverse effects.

== Future ice loss ==
=== Near-term ===

In 2021, the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report estimated that under SSP5-8.5, the scenario associated with the highest global warming, Greenland ice sheet melt would add around to the global sea levels (with a likely (17%–83%) range of and a very likely range (5–95% confidence level) of ), while the &quot;moderate&quot; SSP2-4.5 scenario adds with a likely and very likely range of and , respectively. The optimistic scenario which assumes that the Paris Agreement goals are largely fulfilled, SSP1-2.6, adds around and no more than , with a small chance of the ice sheet gaining mass and thus reducing the sea levels by around .

Some scientists, led by James Hansen, have claimed that the ice sheets can disintegrate substantially faster than estimated by the ice sheet models, but even their projections also have much of Greenland, whose total size amounts to of sea level rise, survive the 21st century. A 2016 paper from Hansen claimed that Greenland ice loss could add around by 2060, in addition to double that figure from the Antarctic ice sheet, if the concentration exceeded 600 parts per million, which was immediately controversial amongst the scientific community, while 2019 research from different scientists claimed a maximum of by 2100 under the worst-case climate change scenario.

As with the present losses, not all parts of the ice sheet would contribute to them equally. For instance, it is estimated that on its own, the Northeast Greenland ice stream would contribute 1.3–1.5 cm by 2100 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. On the other hand, the three largest glaciers - Jacobshavn, Helheim, and Kangerlussuaq - are all located in the southern half of the ice sheet, and just the three of them are expected to add 9.1–14.9 mm under RCP 8.5. Similarly, 2013 estimates suggested that by 2200, they and another large glacier would add
29 to 49 millimetres by 2200 under RCP 8.5, or 19 to 30 millimetres under RCP 4.5. Altogether, the single largest contribution to 21st century ice loss in Greenland is expected to be from the northwest and central west streams (the latter including Jacobshavn), and glacier retreat will be responsible for at least half of the total ice loss, as opposed to earlier studies which suggested that surface melting would become dominant later this century. If Greenland were to lose all of its coastal glaciers, though, then whether or not it will continue to shrink will be entirely determined by whether its surface melting in the summer consistently outweighs ice accumulation during winter. Under the highest-emission scenario, this could happen around 2055, well before the coastal glaciers are lost.

Sea level rise from Greenland does not affect every coast equally. The south of the ice sheet is much more vulnerable than the other parts, and the quantities of ice involved mean that there is an impact on the deformation of Earth&#x27;s crust and on Earth&#x27;s rotation. While this effect is subtle, it already causes East Coast of the United States to experience faster sea level rise than the global average. At the same time, Greenland itself would experience isostatic rebound as its ice sheet shrinks and its ground pressure becomes lighter. Similarly, a reduced mass of ice would exert a lower gravitational pull on the coastal waters relative to the other land masses. These two processes would cause sea level around Greenland&#x27;s own coasts to fall, even as it rises elsewhere. The opposite of this phenomenon happened when the ice sheet gained mass during the Little Ice Age: increased weight attracted more water and flooded certain Viking settlements, likely playing a large role in the Viking abandonment soon afterwards.

=== Long-term ===
Notably, the ice sheet&#x27;s massive size simultaneously makes it insensitive to temperature changes in the short run, yet also commits it to enormous changes down the line, as demonstrated by paleoclimate evidence. Polar amplification causes the Arctic, including Greenland, to warm three to four times more than the global average: thus, while a period like the Eemian interglacial 130,000–115,000 years ago was not much warmer than today globally, the ice sheet was warmer, and its northwest part was 130 ± 300 meters lower than it is at present. Some estimates suggest that the most vulnerable and fastest-receding parts of the ice sheet have already passed &quot;a point of no return&quot; around 1997, and will be committed to disappearance even if the temperature stops rising.

A 2022 paper found that the 2000–2019 climate would already result in the loss of ~3.3% volume of the entire ice sheet in the future, committing it to an eventual of SLR, independent of any future temperature change. They have additionally estimated that if the then-record melting seen on the ice sheet in 2012 were to become its new normal, then the ice sheet would be committed to around SLR. Another paper suggested that paleoclimate evidence from 400,000 years ago is consistent with ice losses from Greenland equivalent to at least of sea level rise in a climate with temperatures close to , which are now inevitable at least in the near future.

It is also known that at a certain level of global warming, effectively the entirety of the Greenland Ice Sheet will eventually melt. Its volume was initially estimated to amount to ~, which would increase the global sea levels by , but later estimates increased its size to ~, leading to ~ of sea level rise.

=== Thresholds for total ice sheet loss ===

In 2006, it was estimated that the ice sheet is most likely to be committed to disappearance at , with a plausible range between and . However, these estimates were drastically reduced in 2012, with the suggestion that the threshold may lie anywhere between and , with the most plausible global temperature for the ice sheet&#x27;s disappearance. That lowered temperature range had been widely used in the subsequent literature, and in the year 2015, prominent NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot claimed that &quot;even the most conservative people in our community&quot; will agree that &quot;Greenland’s ice is gone&quot; after or of global warming.

In 2022, a major review of scientific literature on tipping points in the climate system barely modified these values: it suggested that the threshold would be most likely be at , with the upper level at and the worst-case threshold of remained unchanged. At the same time, it noted that the fastest plausible timeline for the ice sheet disintegration is 1000 years, which is based on research assuming the worst-case scenario of global temperatures exceeding by 2500, while its ice loss otherwise takes place over around 10,000 years after the threshold is crossed; the longest possible estimate is 15,000 years.

Model-based projections published in the year 2023 had indicated that the Greenland ice sheet could be a little more stable than suggested by the earlier estimates. One paper found that the threshold for ice sheet disintegration is more likely to lie between and . It also indicated that the ice sheet could still be saved, and its sustained collapse averted, if the warming were reduced to below , up to a few centuries after the threshold was first breached. However, while that would avert the loss of the entire ice sheet, it would increase the overall sea level rise by up to several meters, as opposed to a scenario where the warming threshold was not breached in the first place.

Another paper using a more complex ice sheet model has found that since the warming passed degrees, ~ of sea level rise became inevitable, closely matching the estimate derived from direct observation in 2022. However, it had also found that would likely only commit the ice sheet to of long-term sea level rise, while near-complete melting of worth of sea level rise would occur if the temperatures consistently stay above . The paper also suggested that ice losses from Greenland may be reversed by reducing temperature to or lower, up until the entirety of South Greenland ice melts, which would cause of sea level rise and prevent any regrowth unless concentrations is reduced to 300 ppm. If the entire ice sheet were to melt, it would not begin to regrow until temperatures fall to below the preindustrial levels.

<text>Shaun Edward Alexander (born August 30, 1977) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Seattle Seahawks and Washington Redskins. He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, earning first-team All-American honors in 1999. He was selected by the Seahawks 19th overall in the 2000 NFL draft. In 2011, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

Alexander set numerous NFL and Seahawks&#x27; franchise records and was named the NFL MVP in 2005. He was also named to the NFL&#x27;s 2000 All-Decade team, and is tied in ranking ninth all time in NFL history for rushing touchdowns (100). Alexander was the first athlete featured on the cover of both the &quot;NCAA Football&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series of video games.

==Early life==
Alexander was born and raised in Florence, Kentucky. His father, Curtis Alexander Jr., works for Morton Salt and his mother Carol works in the truancy department of the Boone County School District. He has an older brother Durran, and four older half-sisters and three older half-brothers. His parents divorced when he was 11, and he and Durran were raised by their mother in a two-bedroom apartment off of Shenandoah Drive in Florence, Kentucky.

Alexander attended Florence Elementary School and Rector A. Jones Middle School. In 1991, he entered Boone County High School. As a freshman, he played football for the junior varsity team and was voted Class President—as he was every year in high school. As well as football, Alexander excelled in basketball, baseball, and track.

In his sophomore season, Alexander made the varsity team as the second-string running back. By mid-season, he was the team&#x27;s featured running back as he rushed for 1,095 yards and 14 touchdowns. During his junior season in 1993, Alexander ran for 2,396 yards and 42 touchdowns as Boone County made it to the state semifinals. In a game versus Campbell County, Alexander rushed for seven touchdowns. He was listed in &quot;Faces in the Crowd&quot; section of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in January 1994.

During his senior season, 1994–1995, Alexander rushed for 3,166 yards and a state record 54 touchdowns and was named Kentucky&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Football&quot;. He also was selected All-American by &quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;″s 1994 All USA team, named &quot;Old Spice Athlete of the Month&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, and was known as &quot;Alexander the Great&quot; and had his high school number 37 retired a few weeks before his graduation. In three varsity seasons, Alexander rushed for 6,657 yards and 110 touchdowns—both of which are Top 10 prep all-time records.

==College career==
Alexander had narrowed his choices down to Michigan, Alabama, and Notre Dame (where his brother Durran played drums in the marching band). He ultimately chose the University of Alabama because of the warm weather and the overall students&#x27; enthusiasm.

In 1995, during his senior year in high school, Alexander accepted a scholarship from Gene Stallings, then-head coach for the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. Mike DuBose replaced Stallings in 1997. In his freshman season on campus, Alexander was redshirted.

In 1996, as a redshirt freshman, Alexander rushed for a school-record 291 yards and four touchdowns in a 26–0 victory over rivals LSU at Tiger Stadium. He finished the year with 589 rushing yards and six touchdowns, and helped the team to a 10–3 record.

The 1997 season proved to be tough for both Alexander and the Crimson Tide, as Alexander finished with 415 rushing yards and three touchdowns, while the Tide limped to four victories.

The 1998 season turned out much better for both, as Alabama improved to 7–5, and Alexander had 18 touchdowns (14 rushing and four receiving) and attained 1,178 yards. He was rewarded with an All-Southeast Conference honors at the end of the season.

Following his junior season, Alexander decided to return for his senior season rather than leaving early for the NFL. After initially being given Heisman Trophy consideration to start the season, those hopes faded as the season progressed and he ended with a sprained ankle versus Tennessee. Alexander still played a key role in leading the Tide to the SEC Championship in 1999, as Alabama trampled #3 Florida with a 34–7 victory. In the fourth quarter of the 1999 Iron Bowl versus rivals Auburn, Alexander led a comeback and scored three rushing touchdowns in the 28–17 victory, finishing the game with 199 total yards. He left the school holding 15 records, including 3,565 career rushing yards.

==Professional career==
===Seattle Seahawks===

====2000–2004====
Alexander was selected by the Seattle Seahawks on April 15 in the 2000 NFL draft in the first round as the 19th overall pick. The Seahawks acquired the pick in the draft following a trade that sent wide receiver Joey Galloway to the Dallas Cowboys. In his rookie season, Alexander saw limited action behind starter Ricky Watters, rushing 64 times for just 313 yards and two touchdowns.

In Alexander&#x27;s second season in the NFL, he became the Seahawks&#x27; featured running back, following injuries and the eventual retirement of Watters. Alexander rushed 309 times for 1,318 yards and 14 touchdowns, only behind Marshall Faulk for total touchdowns. The offensive line was led by Pro Bowler Walter Jones and rookie Steve Hutchinson. On ESPN Sunday Night Football on November 11, 2001, versus AFC West rival Oakland Raiders at Husky Stadium in Seattle, Alexander rushed for a franchise-record 266 yards on 35 carries, including an 88-yard run to the endzone. He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week after his performance against the Raiders. Following the season, Fox Sports Net hired him to do a variety show called &quot;Shaun Alexander Live&quot;, aimed to poke fun at Alexander&#x27;s lack of recognition despite his on-field accomplishments, but it was short-lived.

In 2002, Alexander started all 16 games en route to an NFC leading (and franchise record) 16 rushing touchdowns, four of which came in the first half of Seattle&#x27;s September 29, 2002 game against the Minnesota Vikings in only the second regular-season game ever at Seahawks Stadium in Seattle. He also caught an 80-yard touchdown pass in the first half. The five touchdowns in that half set an NFL record. This was another ESPN Sunday Night Football game, enhancing Alexander&#x27;s reputation for performing phenomenally well in high-profile, prime time nationally televised games.

2003 was another productive year for Alexander. He rushed his way to a career-high of 1,435 rushing yards and scored 16 touchdowns. Seattle also made its first playoff appearance since 2000. Against the Green Bay Packers in the wild card game, Alexander had only 45 yards on 20 carries, but had three rushing touchdowns. Alexander&#x27;s success in the 2003 season earned him his first trip to Honolulu for the annual Pro Bowl.

In 2004, Alexander remained one of the key components of Seattle&#x27;s offense. He finished second in the NFL in rushing yards (with 1,696) to the New York Jets&#x27; Curtis Martin by a single yard. After being passed over for a late-game rushing attempt during his team&#x27;s victory over the Atlanta Falcons, Alexander accused his coach Mike Holmgren of &quot;stabbing him in the back&quot; by denying him an opportunity to win the rushing title. Alexander retracted his comments the following day and expressed support for his coach.

====2005 season====
Alexander had a great deal of success in the 2005 season. In the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he rushed for 73 yards. Other highlights include an 88-yard touchdown run against the Arizona Cardinals on November 6, 2005, and rushing for 165 yards against the St. Louis Rams on November 13, 2005. Also, he had two 4 touchdown games, against Arizona on September 25, 2005, and against the Houston Texans on October 16, 2005. He led the NFL in rushing yards, rushing touchdowns, Pro Bowl votes, and points.

During the 2005 season, Alexander broke the franchise record for the most rushing yards in the Seattle Seahawks&#x27; history. On November 13, 2005, scoring 3 touchdowns, Alexander became the first running back in NFL history to record 15 or more touchdowns in five consecutive seasons. On November 20, 2005, in San Francisco, Alexander became the first player in NFL history to score 19 rushing or receiving touchdowns in only 10 games (Steve Van Buren had 18 in 1945). This feat eventually led to him breaking Priest Holmes record of 27 total touchdowns set in 2003, and his 27 rushing touchdowns also tied Holmes for the most in a single season (the record was broken a year later by LaDainian Tomlinson).

On December 11, 2005, in Seattle&#x27;s NFC West-clinching victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Alexander had his ninth 100–yard rushing game of the year, breaking Chris Warren&#x27;s franchise record of eight 100–yard games. In the process he also set a more significant NFL record, running for 100 yards against divisional opponents in nine straight games, a record previously held by Walter Payton. On December 18, 2005, in a game against the Tennessee Titans, Alexander passed the 1,600-yard mark for the second consecutive season, had a Seahawks franchise record 10th 100-yard rushing game, and scored his 24th rushing touchdown of the year (as well as the 86th of his career, tying him with Priest Holmes at 12th on the all-time rushing touchdown leader list). Perhaps more substantial is that his 96th career touchdown moved him into an 18th place tie with Randy Moss and Eric Dickerson on the all-time touchdown leader list, having already bumped Priest Holmes (94 TDs) into 21st. Alexander also became the first Seahawks player to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

On January 1, 2006, in a game against the Green Bay Packers, Alexander set the single-season touchdown record at 28, and tied Priest Holmes&#x27;s record of 27 rushing touchdowns in a season. Alexander also won his first NFL rushing title with 1,880 rushing yards, while leading the NFC for the second consecutive year. In 2005, he joined Emmitt Smith, Priest Holmes, and Marshall Faulk as the only running backs to record consecutive seasons of 20 or more touchdowns. Combined with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, Alexander aided the Seahawks in producing the league&#x27;s top ranked offense, and the team scoring title.

Four days later, on January 5, he was awarded the 2005 NFL MVP Award, becoming the first Seahawk to win the MVP award. He beat out New York Giants running back Tiki Barber and Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning who had won the award the previous two years. Alexander garnered 19 out of a possible 50 votes. A day after receiving the MVP award, Alexander was named Associated Press Offensive Player of the Year. He received 34 votes of a panel of 50 NFL sportswriters and broadcasters. He was also named the FedEx Ground NFL Player of the Year. At the ESPY Awards Alexander received two awards, Best Record Breaking Performance and Best NFL Player.

In the divisional round against the Washington Redskins, Alexander suffered a concussion early on and had to watch the Seahawks win. However, in the NFC Championship Game against the Carolina Panthers he had 34 carries for 132 yards and two touchdowns, which was easily the best playoff performance of his career.

The Seahawks lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL on February 5, 2006. Alexander was, however, the leading rusher of the game with 95 yards. At the end of the season, he was selected to be the cover athlete of &quot;Madden NFL 2007&quot;. Alexander was the first player to be featured on both the covers of &quot;Madden NFL&quot; and &quot;NCAA Football&quot; (the latter on &quot;2001&quot;). He was also the only one with this accomplishment up until Larry Fitzgerald was selected to appear on &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot;, though Fitzgerald was sharing a cover with the Steelers&#x27; Troy Polamalu.

Alexander&#x27;s MVP season was celebrated musically by Dustin Blatnik and the 12th Man Band in the song &quot;Sweet Shaun Alexander&quot;, a parody of Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. &quot;Sweet Shaun&quot; was widely aired in the Seattle area in the weeks leading up to Super Bowl XL, plus national play on ESPN Radio and other outlets. The song was decried in Sports &quot;Illustrated&quot; magazine, calling this parody &quot;the sacrilege with cheese&quot;.

====2006 season====
In March 2006, Alexander signed an eight-year, $62 million contract ($15.1 million of which was guaranteed and $15 million to be paid in the first year of the contract) to remain with the Seattle Seahawks organization, becoming the highest paid running back in NFL history at the time. However, the Seahawks All-Pro offensive guard Steve Hutchinson left to go to the Minnesota Vikings several weeks later in free agency, weakening an offensive line that had been a large part of Alexander&#x27;s 2005 productivity.

Alexander broke his left foot in Week 3 of the season, effectively continuing the Madden Curse. However, in the same game, Alexander set a team record while scoring his 102nd touchdown of his career, breaking Steve Largent&#x27;s record. He returned to action on November 19 against the San Francisco 49ers, rushing 17 times for 37 yards. In a November 27 game on ESPN&#x27;s Monday Night Football against the Packers, Alexander carried the ball a team record 40 times for 201 yards in a game that featured snow for the first time at Qwest Field. Alexander&#x27;s performance was a return to MVP form and yet another prime-time showcase for Alexander, who was still playing with the broken foot. In a December 10 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Alexander broke Barry Sanders&#x27; record for most consecutive games with a run of 10 or more yards.

Alexander finished the 2006 season with 252 rushing attempts for 896 yards and seven touchdowns in ten games. In the Divisional Round against the Chicago Bears, Alexander had 26 carries for 108 yards and two touchdowns in the 27–24 loss.

====2007 season====
During the Week 1 game against Tampa Bay, Alexander sustained a fractured left wrist. He indicated that the injury was not major and that he would continue to play, but his performance took a noticeable turn for the worse. During Week 5, Alexander&#x27;s lead blocker, Mack Strong, was injured with a herniated disk in his neck, forcing him to retire; he was replaced by Leonard Weaver. This left Alexander even more exposed and as a result, injuries continued to plague him. In Week 9, he sprained both his knee and ankle. Even so, in the final game of the regular season, Alexander was able to become the eighth player in NFL history to score 100 rushing touchdowns.

Alexander&#x27;s final regular season statistics for the 2007 season were 716 yards rushing on 207 attempts, a 3.5–yard per carry with four touchdowns in 10 games. He added 14 receptions for 76 yards and a touchdown to his rushing totals. After a January 12, 2008, playoff loss to the Green Bay Packers in which Alexander recorded only 20 yards on 9 carries and scored just one touchdown, the Seahawks opted to cut Alexander from the team on April 22, 2008.

===Washington Redskins===
After his release, Alexander visited several teams including the Cincinnati Bengals, Detroit Lions, and New Orleans Saints, but was not able to come to terms on a contract until he visited the Washington Redskins. On October 14, 2008, the team signed Alexander to fill the void left when back-up running back Ladell Betts went down with a knee injury. However, the Redskins released Alexander on November 25, 2008 after he logged only 11 carries in four games and averaged 2.2 yards per carry.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
== Legacy ==

Alexander is one of 25 players with 100 career touchdowns, ranking 17th as of 2024 and he is one of ten with 100 rushing touchdowns. However, he has not been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where he has not even been selected as a semifinalist since being first eligible in 2014. Two of the teammates who blocked for him on the offensive line, Walter Jones and Steve Hutchinson, are inductees.

In 2016, Alexander was inducted into The Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Alexander married Valerie Alexander (née Boyd) in April 2002 after a two-year courtship. Together, the couple have 12 living children. The couple had another child who died unexpectedly at two months of age. Alexander has an older brother by one year named Durran who serves as executive director of the Shaun Alexander Foundation.
