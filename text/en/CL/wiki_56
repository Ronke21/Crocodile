<text>Cheong Wa Dae (), also known as the Blue House in English, is a public park that formerly served as the presidential residence and the diplomatic reception halls of South Korea from 1948 to 2022. It is located at the Jongno District in the capital city of Seoul, behind Gyeongbokgung Palace.

Cheong Wa Dae is a complex of multiple buildings built largely in the traditional Korean architectural style with some modern architectural elements and facilities. Cheong Wa Dae now consists of the Main Office Hall &quot;Bon-gwan&quot;, the Presidential Residence, the State Reception House &quot;Yeongbin-gwan&quot;, the &quot;Chunchu-gwan&quot;, Press Hall, the Secretariat Buildings, and other buildings and structures. The entire complex covers approximately 250,000 square metres or 62 acres.

Cheong Wa Dae was built upon the site of the royal garden of the Joseon period (1392–1910). While the Blue House served as an executive office, it was one of the most protected official residences in Asia. Upon the inauguration of President Yoon Suk Yeol in May 2022, Cheong Wa Dae was relieved of its duties as the official residence and executive office of the president. The president&#x27;s offices and residence were moved to the Ministry of National Defense building in the Yongsan District of Seoul, and the former executive residence of Cheong Wa Dae and its grounds were fully converted into a public park.

Since the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol in December 2024, there have been calls to return the presidential office and official residence to the Blue House.

== Early history ==
=== Goryeo and Joseon eras===

The Blue House dates back to the Goryeo period of Korea. The location of Cheong Wa Dae was the site of a royal villa in Hanyang, the southern capital of the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392). It was built by King Sukjong (r. 1095–1105) in 1104. Goryeo&#x27;s principal capital was at Kaesong, and it also maintained a western capital at Pyongyang and an eastern capital at Gyeongju on opposite sides of the Korean peninsula. After the Joseon period (1392–1897) moved its capital to Hanyang, Gyeongbokgung was built in 1395, the fourth year of the reign of King Taejo (r. 1392–1398) as the main palace, and the royal villa lot became the back garden of the palace. It was used as the site for civil service examinations and military training. Feng Shui singer Kim Wi-je said, &quot;Samgaksan Mountain is a scenic view facing north and south. The mountain range that started there is three and four, and they are defending the famous place, so if you rely on Samgaksan Mountain to build a capital, the Dead Sea will come and pay tribute in nine years&quot;. After King Taejo of the Joseon Dynasty established the country, the new capital was designated in Hanseongbu. Later, in 1394, a new palace was built; the site was near the palace site of Nanjing, Goryeo. The current Cheong Wa Dae seat corresponds to the north of the former royal palace Gyeongbokgung. At that time, it was said that there were temples such as Chungsundang and Chirojeong Pavilion in this place. Here, descendants of kings and founding contributors gathered to conduct large-scale membership.

After Gyeongbokgung was burned down during the 1592–1598 Japanese invasions of Korea, it was left unattended for a long time. However, during the reign of King Gojong, Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt under the leadership of Heungseon Daewongun, and a support was built outside the Sinmumun Gate and in the current Cheong Wa Dae. Later, buildings such as Yoongmundang were built in the background, and Gyeongmudang was also renovated at this time. There were 32 buildings in Gyeongmudae, including Oungak, a resting place for the king. In Yoongmundang, a festival and military training was held.

=== 1910–1948: Foreign occupations ===
Following the neighboring Empire of Japan&#x27;s annexation of Korea in 1910, the Imperial Japanese governor of Korea used the &quot;Gyeongbokgung&quot; grounds for the Government-General Building. In 1927, many buildings in the background, including Gyeongmudae, were demolished. In July 1939, Japan built an official residence/office for the governor-general on the site of &quot;Cheong Wa Dae&quot;. Even after liberation following the Second Sino-Japanese War (1931/1937–1945) and parallel Second World War (1939/1941–1945) in September 1945, this location was used as his official residence by the occupying United States and its designated United States Army Military Government in Korea&#x27;s John Haji, during 1945-1948.

== Evolution of the Blue House ==

=== 1948–2022: Presidential residence of South Korea and attempt to relocate ===

After the establishment of South Korean government in the southern portion of the Korean peninsula in 1948, its first president Syngman Rhee (served 1948–1960) named the former Imperial Japanese Governor-General&#x27;s residence Gyeongmudae (), which was the name of one of the few old buildings for former official residence there. He used it as his office and residence. The second South Korean President, Yun Po-sun (1897–1990, served 1960–1962), changed the name to &quot;Cheong Wa Dae&quot; after he was inaugurated in 1960. The name was reportedly changed as it had ostensibly become associated with authoritarianism and dictatorship. An alternate name &quot;Hwaryeongdae&quot; was proposed alongside &quot;Cheong Wa Dae&quot; as a possible renaming candidate, but the latter was ultimately chosen.

After Park Chung Hee (served 1962–1979) came to power through a military coup as third President, some argued that the colour should be changed to yellow, saying it is a more precious color, but Park Chung Hee dismissed it. At the regime of Park Chung Hee, the Blue House structure had a president&#x27;s office on the first floor and a living space for the president&#x27;s family on the second floor. However, as the building was narrow and ageing, a major renovation was carried out during the Park administration.

In January 1968, North Korean infiltrators nearly reached the building in a bid to assassinate President Park during the Blue House raid. In the ensuing melee, 28 North Koreans, 26 South Koreans, and four Americans were killed.

On October 26, 1979, Park was assassinated by the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) Director in a safe house in the Blue House grounds.

Presidents Park, Choi Kyu-hah, and Chun Doo-hwan used the building both as their office and official residence. While President Roh Tae-woo was in office, a new office building, official residence, and press center, called &quot;Chunchu-gwan&quot;, was built. The main office building was opened in April 1991. In September 1991, an advisory committee consisting of 22 experts was formed to gather opinions and build the current main building, official residence, and Chunchugwan. In 1993, during Kim Young-sam&#x27;s presidency, the building built by Japan for the then-official residence was dismantled. Roh Moo-hyun tried to change the structure of the main building to strengthen communication with the staff, but failed. The wartime evacuation facility built by Park Chung Hee in 1975 was repaired in 2003 to create a room (underground bunker) for the National Crisis Management Centre.

Because the Cheong Wa Dae has often been regarded as a symbol of the president&#x27;s imperial power, many presidents made efforts to relocate the presidential office and residence.

Kim Young-sam was the first to push for relocation as a symbolic break from the previous military dictatorship era. Kim Young-sam pledged to move his office to the Seoul Government Complex near Gwanghwamun but was unable to achieve this. Instead, the road in front of the Blue House and the mountain Inwangsan was made open to the public. In addition, 12 safe houses located in Gungjeong-dong and Samcheong-dong were demolished, and Mugunghwa Garden, a civic park, was created.

Kim Dae Jung also pushed for a plan to set up offices at the Seoul and Gwacheon Government Complex but stopped due to security and cost problems. Instead, measures were taken to open the Chilgung Palace located in the Cheong Wa Dae precincts and expand the scope of Cheong Wa Dae viewing.

The Roh Moo-hyun administration tried to move all government departments, including Cheong Wa Dae, to Sejong City, but failed due to the Constitutional Court&#x27;s decision to confirm the unconstitutionality of the new administrative capital law. Since then, Roh Moo Hyun has opened Sinmumun Gate, the northern gate of Gyeongbokgung, and Bukaksanseong-ro.

During the Lee Myung-bak administration, the relocation of the secretary&#x27;s and security&#x27;s office was also considered, but it was suspended due to costs and approval needed by the National Assembly. Moon Jae-In made President Gwanghwamun a presidential election pledge, but after taking office, it was canceled due to security and cost issues. Instead, the road in front of Cheong Wa Dae and the fortress road of Bugaksan, which had been temporarily opened, were completely opened.

=== 2022–present: Conversion into a public park ===
On March 20, 2022, President-elect Yoon Suk Yeol announced that he would take office on May 10 in the Ministry of National Defense building in the Yongsan District of Seoul, and open the Blue House to the public as a park. In May 2022, following an order issued by Yoon after he took office, the building officially converted into a public park and opened to public visitation for the first time in its 74-year history, with a maximum of 39,000 visitors allowed daily. The visitors can witness cultural performances, tours, and hiking trails that lead to the mountain Bugaksan, Cheongwadae&#x27;s scenic backdrop.

The Government of South Korea allocated ₩36 billion (about $29.5 million) from government reserve funds for the relocation of the office. However, the Ministry of National Defense at the time faced criticism, with concerns raised regarding the potential negative impact on national security, associated costs, and other issues such as heightened nuclear activity in North Korea and challenges to post-pandemic economic recovery. A recent survey revealed that 58% of the people opposed this move.

=== 2024–present: Calls to restore Blue House as presidential office ===
In December 2024, after the impeachment of President Yoon, there have been increasing calls to restore Cheong Wa Dae as the presidential office and official residence. Rep. Kim Byung-joo of the Democratic Party, a former general, said that the Yongsan office was unsuitable as a presidential office, while conservative mayor of Daegu, Hong Joon-pyo said that Yoon&#x27;s move away from the Blue House &quot;diminished the president&#x27;s charisma from the outset and emboldened the (political) opposition&quot; and &quot;The Blue House, like the White House in the United States, is a symbol of Korea&quot;.

==Identity and amenities==

=== Logo ===
The Blue House logo was first enacted in 1995 during the Kim Young-sam administration. The logo was modified in 2005 during the Roh Moo-hyun administration. In 2008, with the inauguration of the Lee Myung-bak government, a new logo was released. In 2013, a new logo was released with the launch of Park Geun-hye&#x27;s government and was used until the end of Moon Jae-in&#x27;s government in 2022.

The Cheong Wa Dae has a land area of 253,505 m2 and a floor space of 76,685 pyeong. At the time of the Japanese colonial era, the site area of the Governor-General&#x27;s office was 644,337 m2, but after liberation, it was reduced to 230,980 m2, and then increased to the current level with the expansion of related buildings and facilities such as security. 73 parcels belong to the Blue House, including Sejong-ro 1, 157-94 Samcheong-dong, and 9 other parcels, Sejong-ro 1-91 and 17 parcels, and Gungjeong-dong 1–2, and 43 parcels.

From December 2007 to February 2008, the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation covered the leaders of the Roh Moo Hyun government who were about to retire and made the last 100 days of the regime a documentary about Cheong Wa Dae. The program captured secret stories from the main building, where the president&#x27;s office is located, to the official residence and the Yeomingwan. Lee Myung-bak also made and released his documentary video shortly before his retirement, and the interior of the Blue House, including the official residence, was also released to some extent. Moon Jae-in opened the office to commemorate the 100th day since his presidency.

===Main building===

The main building () was built in September 1991 and used for the president&#x27;s office. There was also criticism that the space was larger than necessary and that it was closer to a building for protocol than a space for work and communication, so when President Moon Jae-In took office, he decided to see only official work here. The main gate of the Blue House is called the 11th gate; it is a place where ministers and officials of higher rank enter during the Cabinet meetings. Entry is allowed only after showing a pass. The interior was partially unveiled on the day of Moon Jae-In&#x27;s inauguration.

The main building is based on traditional wooden structures and palace architecture. It has single-story annexes arranged on the left and right sides and 150,000 Korean blue tiles on the second floor. In addition to general tiles such as Sukiwa, Amkiwa, Sumaksa, and Ammaksa, decorative tiles can be seen in palaces such as miscellaneous statues, fiddles, dragon heads, and earthenware.

On the first floor of the main building, there is the First Lady&#x27;s office, the Mugunghwa Room, a reception room, and the Inwang Room used for small lunches, dinners, and refreshments. The second floor features the president&#x27;s office, reception room, and a white room where people eat. The lawn in front of the building includes a state welcome event, a military honor guard, and a traditional funeral. Sejong Room, a separate building on the west side, was the venue for Cabinet meetings and appointment award events, while Chungmu Room, a separate building on the east side, was the venue for medium-sized lunches, dinners, and meetings.

===Guest house===

The guest house () was completed in December 1978 as a building that held large-scale meetings, welcoming foreign state guests, and various official events. It is currently the oldest modern building in the &quot;Cheong Wa Dae&quot; precincts. The first floor is a reception event for foreign guests as a reception room, and the second floor is a place where large-scale luncheon and dinner events are held, decorated with Mugunghwa and laurel trees. However, it is said that the use is not strictly divided. The capacity is about 250 people, but there are no separate accommodations and not enough decorations or facilities to feel Korean style; it is close to a huge banquet hall used as a venue for luncheon.

In the past, there was no space in the Blue House to greet state guests. Therefore, the Chosun Hotel and Walkerhill Hotel were used or the Korean house (content 3) was used as a guest house. In 1958, the Syngman Rhee administration nationalized Jangchungdan Park to build a guesthouse and began construction. Construction was temporarily suspended due to the April 19 Revolution and the May 16 military coup, but the Shilla Hotel guesthouse was completed in February 1967. However, it was operated mainly by state guests suffered financial difficulties, and was eventually sold to the public in 1973 and became the current Shilla Hotel.

Since then, it has been argued that the space for events in the Blue House is not suitable for the national status, and construction of the current guesthouse on the old site of Gyeongnongjae, which was built to encourage farming during the Joseon period, began in January 1978. The guesthouse was completed at the end of that year; in October 1998, the surrounding old buildings were renovated and then re-renovated in June 2000.

===Old residence===

The old residence () was completed in 1990 as the place where the president lived with his family. Although it was not well disclosed to reporters in the past, the entrance to the official residence was disclosed in March and November 2003, when Roh Moo-hyun was in office. Lee Myung-bak had also released images related to family life, and while president, Moon Jae-in made several public appearances on his way to work at the entrance of his official residence.

Park Geun-hye&#x27;s daily life was revealed when Kim Mak-up, a contractor and butler when Park Geun-hye was in office, was investigated by the prosecution. At this time, the structure of the official residence was also known, and according to his statement, the official residence was divided into an inner room and an annex, and the annex was where the bodyguard resided. At that time, the interior had a bedroom, study, fitness room, newsroom, Korean room, powder room, etc., and the president&#x27;s bedroom was equipped with a bed, dressing table, drawer, TV, desk, laptop, and intercom. The annex had a security room, a cooking room, a dining room, and a reception room which consisted of a meeting table, a round table, and a TV.

Presidents Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo, and Roh Moo-hyun stayed at Cheong Wa Dae on the last day of their terms and left Cheong Wa Dae the next day. Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung, and Lee Myung-bak left Cheong Wa Dae on the last day of their terms and served as presidents until midnight. Meanwhile, Choi Kyu-hah and Park Geun-hye stepped down before a successor was decided, both of whom stayed at Cheong Wa Dae for a few more days after their presidential terms ended. Previous presidents moved in at the same time as they took office, but Moon Jae-In did not move in until the third day of his inauguration due to facility maintenance. This was the first time since the completion of the official residence.

Before the construction of the current main building and official residence during Roh Tae-woo&#x27;s presidency, the old main building&#x27;s first floor served as the presidential office, while the second floor functioned as the presidential residence. It is said that during this period, there were two shutters on the stairs connecting these floors. Later, under Roh Tae-woo&#x27;s reign, the current official residence building was built behind the former main building, incorporating traditional architectural styles to maximize the function of the residential space. The layout included a main building for living space, an annex for hosting events, and the creation of traditional-style gardens and men&#x27;s quarters in the front yard.

Near the official residence, there is a pavilion called Ounjeong and a building called Chimryugak. It was originally located at the current site of the official residence but was moved to its current location during the new construction. In addition to Ounjeong Pavilion, there were two to three pavilions in the Cheong Wa Dae precincts that now have been demolished. The date when both Ounjeong Pavilion and Chimryugak Pavilion were built is unknown. However, it seems that it was built afterward, considering that neither building is mentioned in the shape of the northern palace, which is believed to have been built in 1907. Some say it was built during the Rhee Syngman era, but the signboard of Oh Un-Jeong is also handwritten by Syngman Rhee.

The so-called handsome stone Buddha, the stone seated Buddha of the square pedestal of Gyeongju, is also located around the official residence. As the name suggests, it was originally located in Gyeongju, but it is said that Governor Masatake Terouchi moved to the governor&#x27;s residence during the Japanese colonial period. When the official residence was newly built in the 1930s, the Buddha statue was also moved, and in 1989, when the official residence of the Blue House was newly built, it moved back to its current position.

With the inauguration of President Yoon Suk Yeol on May 10, 2022, it lost its function as an official residence and was changed to an old residence.

===Yeomingwan===

Yeomingwan () is the place where Cheong Wa Dae aides work and is divided into three buildings. It was changed to Wiminkwan during the presidency of Lee Myung-bak. When President Moon Jae-in took office, it was returned to Yeomingwan, the name of the expansion during the Roh Moo-hyun regime. Yeomingwan is taken from Yeomin Dongrak, a phrase from Mencius, and means &quot;to share joy with the people&quot;. On the other hand, Wimin speculates that it means &#x27;politics for the people&#x27;. Shortly after its launch, the Moon Jae-in government initially considered retaining the name &quot;Women&#x27;s Hall&quot; but ultimately reverted to &quot;Yeomin Hall.&quot; It aimed to prevent any suggestion of hierarchy, ensuring the people were not perceived as subordinate to the Blue House.

The main building and Yeomingwan are about 500m away. Roh Moo-hyun envisioned a Korean-style West Wing while constructing Yeomin Hall 1, and frequently worked there. However, in the second half of his administration, he preferred the office of the main building, and Lee Myung-bak also received reports from the office of the Yeomingwan three or four times. Park Geun-hye did not visit the office of Yeomingwan during his presidency, but Moon Jae-in worked at Yeomingwan again.

The construction of Yeomin Hall 1 began in May 2004 and was completed in December. It has a floor space of 974 pyeong with one basement floor and three ground floors. The Chief of Staff&#x27;s office and the State Affairs Office are located on the second floor, and the President&#x27;s simple office, small meeting room, and conference room are located on the third floor. Before the establishment of Yeomin Hall 1, Yeomin Hall 2 was referred to as an annex, while Yeomin Hall 3 was known as Dong Annex. Completed in 1969 and 1972, respectively, both are older structures. Following a safety assessment rating them as a D-grade, the National Assembly prioritized budget allocation for repair work. The Blue House Library is located in Yeomin Hall 2, and as of January 2018, there are 18,662 books. Books can only be rented, and the library receives applications every month and purchases books after internal review.

===Sugungteo===

Sugungteo Site () was named because the former main building, the official building of the Governor-General of Joseon during the Japanese colonial period, was demolished in November 1993 and restored to its old state. In addition, information boards and commemorative stones of the old main building were made to inform visitors of the origin of the Sugung site.

===Sangchunjae===

Sangchunjae () is a traditional hanok located behind Nokjiwon, the garden of Cheong Wa Dae, and is used for foreign guests. The meaning of Sangchunjae is &quot;a house where spring always continues&quot;. The current site of Sangchunjae Pass was the site of an annex called Maehwasil, a Japanese-style wooden building during the Japanese colonial period. It was about 66 square meters in size. After the establishment of the government, it was changed to Sangchunsil, which was used as a ritual building for refreshments and dinner events. Later, in March 1978, Sangchunsil was demolished and Sangchunjae, a 73m2 natural slate roof-style wooden building, was built. In November 1982, the existing Sangchunjae Pass was demolished and a 417.96m2 hanok was completed in half a year, taking its current shape. It is the first traditional hanok built in the Cheong Wa Dae precincts, and it is said to have used Chunyangmok (Content 4), which is more than 200 years old. Inside, there is a living room made of Daecheongmaru and two ondol rooms.

Chun Doo-hwan is said to have frequently met foreign guests and held informal meetings at Sangchunjae. Successive presidents also used it as a venue for informal meetings and meetings with foreign leaders. Park Geun-hye held a New Year&#x27;s press conference at Sangchunjae for the first time in January 2017, when the impeachment trial was underway. After Moon Jae-In took office, Sangchunjae Pass underwent repair due to extensive moisture damage over time.

===Nokjiwon===

Nokjiwon () is a garden in the Cheong Wa Dae precinct that has more than 120 species of trees. During the Japanese colonial period, it was the garden of the official residence of the Governor-General of Korea. It was also used as a site for livestock farms and greenhouses. After the establishment of the government in 1968, a garden was created when a space was needed to function as an outdoor venue in the Blue House. Initially, the green area was 5,289 m2, but it was expanded to 5,620 m2 in 1985. Currently, Nokjiwon is holding various events such as Children&#x27;s Day, Parents&#x27; Day, and the Day of Persons with Disabilities.

===Chunchugwan===

Chunchugwan () was completed in September 1990 as a venue for the president&#x27;s press conference and a newsletter room for reporters. With a floor space of 1,028 pyeong, it has three stories above ground and one basement floor; the roof is covered with earthenware. The name Chunchugwan originated from the Goryeo and Joseon periods.

Until the Kim Dae-jung government, reporters could freely go to the secretariat building in Cheong Wa Dae to cover the secretary. Since the Roh Moo Hyun administration, security measures have strengthened, resulting in a complete ban on reporters accessing the Blue House grounds; it can only be covered by the Spring and Autumn Hall.

Briefings by Cheong Wa Dae officials now take place at Chunchugwan. Under a press pool system, representatives cover events and share content, imposing significant restrictions on Cheong Wa Dae coverage.

===Mugunghwa Garden===
Mugunghwa Garden () is a civic park built after demolishing the house of Gungjeong-dong in July 1993. Five safe houses were demolished and built, and it is 10,560 m2. Mugunghwa Garden faces Cheong Wa Dae, and the back gate faces Changchangmun. In the middle of the hill is a central square and a well. In addition, a stone wall 30m long and 3m high is located at the site of the grand banquet hall in Angana-dong, where Park Chung Hee was assassinated.

===Chilgung===
Chilgung () is a Joseon-era shrine located right next to the Blue House guesthouse. It is called Chilgung because it enshrines the seven concubines who could not become queens. Due to the security of the Blue House, only those who applied to visit the Blue House are allowed to watch the commentary.

In the wake of the January 21 incident, the north of Chilgung Palace was demolished to create a road; it was a habitual traffic accident area, but it was also aimed at strengthening the security of the Blue House. Due to this construction, Jeogyeonggung Palace and Daebingung Palace were moved to their current positions. Chilgung Palace has reopened to the public in connection with Cheong Wa Dae visits in 2001.

===Seobyeolgwan===
Seobyeolgwan () is a meeting-only building located on the west side of the main building of the Blue House, facing Chunchugwan with a heliport in between. Yeonpungmun Gate, located right in front of it, is a place where Cheong Wa Dae employees enter and outsiders enter.

Secret meetings known as the &quot;Seobyeolgwan Conference&quot; were frequently held within the Blue House due to its secure location and lack of access records, maintaining confidentiality. Originating in 1997 to address the IMF economic crisis, it has since been used in many governments. In October 2002, during a hearing on remittance to North Korea, Rep. Uhm Ho-sung of the Grand National Party publicly referenced the conference for the first time. During the Lee Myung-bak administration, there were weekly discussions on economic matters that occurred under the banner of a macro-policy council, involving key figures such as the deputy prime minister for economic affairs, the governor of the Bank of Korea, the chairman of the Financial Services Commission, and the senior presidential secretary for economic affairs.

However, there was often criticism that it was a closed-door agreement because no records, including the duration of the meetings, were left. Controversy escalated when during an annex meeting, 4.2 trillion won worth of funding was given by the Park Geun-hyen government as a way to the support Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering. Criticism also mounted over the decision to set economic policies and determine the fate of insolvent conglomerates and banks at secret meetings. As a result, the Seobyeolgwan Conference, which was called the &quot;hotbed of government administration&quot;, was no longer held after June 2016, but revived in December 2018 under the name of the Economic Coordination Conference after the inauguration of the Moon Jae-inn government.

In November 2019, the interior structure of the annex was remodeled while keeping its appearance intact. It was an underdeveloped and closed building, and there was a lack of conference rooms in the Cheong Wa Dae precincts. The purpose was to relocate secretive meetings from the closed-door chamber to Yangji, converting it into a meeting venue accommodating both high-level and working-level officials. During the remodeling process, a name change was considered, but this was canceled because &quot;it could be an opportunity to change the name of Seobyeolgwan, which has been disgraced&quot;.

===Sihwa and Yeonpung Gates===

Sihwamun Gate () and Yeonpungmun Gate () are the doors of the Blue House but are separated from the main gate. Yeonpungmun Gate served as a guide building for visitors to the Blue House and was completed in February 2009. It is 859m2 in size with two floors above ground and one basement floor. On the first floor, there is a visitor information room, a rest room, an entrance gate, and the Nonghyup Blue House branch, and on the second floor, there is a book cafe and an interview room. It is an eco-friendly building with a geothermal system and a solar panel system.

Yeonpungmun Gate was also controversial as a place where various official and informal meetings were held and attended by Cheong Wa Dae officials. In 2009, there were suspicions that executives of three mobile carriers, SK Telecom, LG Uplus, and KT, were invited to contribute a large amount of funds, and a secret meeting attended by policy advisers such as defense, administrative safety, unification, and foreign trade was also held at Yeonpungmun. There was also talk that an official from the Mir Foundation participated in the Yeonpungmun meeting in 2016.

It was in 1970 that an information room was established in Cheong Wa Dae. Since then, in August 2007, during the Roh Moo Hyun government, the 55-myeon meeting room and the 22 information room, which were the names of the information rooms at the time, have been changed to the Bukak information room and the fountain information room, respectively. These numbers were the numbers of the guard post where the information room was located, which was intended to be changed into soft, easy-to-understand words that could help visitors understand. After the inauguration of the Lee Myung-bak government, the existing information room, which had few convenience facilities other than two sofas, was extensively constructed to take its current shape. The names of the Bukak Information Room and the fountain Information Room were also changed to Yeonpungmun Gate and Sihwamun Gate, respectively, which was derived from Sihwa Yeonpung, meaning &quot;opening the era of harmony and growing the economy every year&quot;. It also created a bank on the premises that visitors and employees could use, and Nonghyup was finally selected.

The main gate of Cheong Wa Dae is only available to a small number of people, including the president, foreign leaders, and Cabinet members; most Cheong Wa Dae employees enter through Yeonpungmun Gate or Sihwamun Gate. Sihwamun Gate, adjacent to Gyeongho-dong, is mainly used by bodyguards, and Yeonpungmun Gate adjacent, to Yeomingwan, is mainly used by secretarial staff.

===Cheong Wa Dae Sarangchae===

Cheong Wa Dae Sarangchae is a building built for tourists visiting Cheong Wa Dae and is a space that teaches Korean history and culture. Inside the building, there are artifacts related to past presidents and an exhibition hall. The history and old photos of Cheong Wa Dae, as well as the old photos and history of Gyeongbokgung, are all displayed there. In addition, visitors can purchase Korean foods and souvenirs.

On the first floor, there is a Korea Tourism Exhibition Hall, a souvenir shop, and a shelter, and on the second floor, there is a Cheong Wa Dae Hall and a public communication experience center.

Originally, this location was the presidential chief of staff&#x27;s official residence, but when the front road of the Blue House was opened in February 1996, it was changed into a complex cultural space to provide convenience and attractions for the people. At that time, it was called Hyoja-dong Sarangbang, and the building was remodeled in January 2010 due to aging; since then, it has kept its appearance and name. On the first floor, there were the National Public Relations Center and the Seoul Public Relations Center, and on the second floor, there were the Presidential Hall, the Government Public Relations Center, and the G20 Rest Area.

To the north is the mountain Bukhansan, flanked by two mountains, Naksan, symbolizing the Azure Dragon, on the left and Inwangsan symbolizing the White tiger, on the right. To the south is Namsan, the protective mountain of the capital. In front flow the Cheonggyecheon stream and Han River.

=== Guards ===
Cheong Wa Dae security is handled by the Presidential Security Service. Three organizations belong to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency: the 101st Guards, the 202nd Guards, and the 22nd Police Guard, who are all in charge of the security and protection of the Blue House. The 101st Guards protect the interior of Cheong Wa Dae, and the 202nd Guards protect the exterior. The police guards are in charge of guarding the president at events outside Cheong Wa Dae. In the military organization, the first security team belonging to the Capital Security Command is in charge of outer security. There are two battalions, a combat support squadron, an armored squadron, and an air defense unit under its wing. It was established by integrating the 30th and 33rd guards that existed in the past. The number of troops under the wing is about 2,000.

==Feng shui==
Geomancers have long considered the area in which Cheong Wa Dae is located as an auspicious location. This view was backed up by an inscription on a stone wall that reads: &quot;The Most Blessed Place on Earth&quot;, found behind the official presidential residence during the construction of a new building in 1990. Others contend that it is cursed; an urban legend known as the &quot;Blue House Curse&quot; (). Choi Chang-jo, a former professor of geography at Seoul National University, argued in the 1990s that &quot;the Cheong Wa Dae site is a permanent residence of dead souls or a residence of God&quot; due to the misfortunes that have befallen onto former presidents.

Since the time from Japanese rule of Korea, the Blue House served as the official residence of the president until the inauguration of Yoon Suk Yeol. According to legend, when the Japanese military evacuated the Blue House, they destroyed the local feng shui, causing all subsequent South Korean presidents to be cursed and have a bad end. Excluding acting presidents, among the 13 South Korean presidents, 4 were prosecuted and jailed after leaving office (Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo, Lee Myung-bak, Park Geun-hye); 3 stepped down due to civil movements or coups (Syngman Rhee, Yun Po-sun, Choi Kyu-hah); 1 was assassinated in office (Park Chung Hee); 1 chose to commit suicide after leaving office due to investigation (Roh Moo-hyun); while two survived the presidency and are not prosecuted (Kim Young-sam, Kim Dae-jung), they were sometimes included in the list because their children were jailed for corruption; Moon Jae-in is under investigation for his former son-in-law&#x27;s bribery; Yoon Suk Yeol has moved out of the Blue House while in office, but he is being impeached by the National Assembly due to political disputes and the sudden declaration of martial law. These curses are believed to still be in effect.

Disregarding curses or feng shui, scholars believe from the perspective of political science that South Korea&#x27;s presidential system makes it easy for South Korean presidents to encounter unexpected events. These include the abuse of power due to excessive power in personnel appointments and dismissals and lack of checks and balances; South Korea&#x27;s chaebols have given rise to crony capitalism and close ties between government and business, which has easily led to corruption; the single-term presidential system often makes his government a lame duck, and when the president&#x27;s influence wanes, it is easy for prosecutors and investigative agencies to obtain evidence; serious party struggles; and even successive presidents will pursue the crimes of their predecessor.

<text>Ribeirinha is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Horta in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2011 was 427, in an area of 12.26 km2. It contains the localities Canadinha, Chã da Cruz, Espalhafatos, Lomba dos Espalhafatos and Rua da Igreja.

==History==
The parish receives its name from the small river and valley that was occupied during the period of settlement. Riberinha, in Portuguese, literally means small &quot;ribeira&quot;, or small river-valley owing to its location. New settlers constructed their village two kilometers from the coast, due to several incursions by pirates. This distance allowed the inhabitants to monitor the coast and plan traps for the invaders. One area, &quot;Poceirão dos Mouros&quot;, refers to one of these traps where the pirates (the &quot;Moors of the Canal&quot;, as they were known) were ensnared.

In 1643, as recounted by friar Diogo das Chagas, the parish consisted of 71 homes and 254 inhabitants. A quarter of a century later, the Church of São Mateus da Ribeirinha was constructed, and would remain the center of religious life in the parish until the violent earthquake of July 9, 1998.

One of the more colorful stories from Faial pertains to the end of the Iberian Union, when (in 1640) Spanish residents of Salão were expelled from their homes by their neighbors in Cedros. Many escaped by way of their frontier with Ribeirinha bringing with them their clothes and possessions, which were lost during the violent events. The area where their clothing was tossed in the ensuing scuffle was given the name &quot;Espalhafatos&quot;, which means &quot;scattered suits&quot;, referring to the ornamented clothing found scattered along the route.

On May 21, 1932, a giant hydroplane, the Dornier Wall (DO-X) with twelve motors, on a trip to Vigo, Spain made port in front of the community.

Generally, the population of this region has shown a dramatic decrease between 1890 (1,112), 1940 (1,031) and the last census 2001 (439). This primarily the consequences of immigration, economic upheavals and a shift from agricultural production (and its lower standard of living).

Overlooking the canal, the Ribeirinha lighthouse was one of the more important landmarks on the island. It was mentioned in many works of the Portuguese writer Vitorino Nemésio, who wrote the ex-libris of the lighthouse in his work &quot;Mau Tempo no Canal&quot;. The lighthouse is a square form, covered in white azulejo (tiles); a rectangular base, featuring a central tower. Construction began during the month of May, 1915m and inaugurated in the winter of 1919 (November 1). Its optic (made from crystal) and lantern (partly red) distinguish it as a unique World Heritage artifact. Following the earthquake of 1998, the building was abandoned due to major cracks and deterioration of the internal structure. Following the earthquake, which was centered 5 km off the coast of Ponta da Ribeirinha, the lighthouse was left in ruins. A preemptive demolition of the building in 2001 was abandoned following a campaign of the &quot;Liga dos Amigos do Farol&quot; (the &quot;League of Friends of the Lighthouse&quot;). Their objective to preserve and reconstruct the lighthouse has not yet materialized. Meanwhile, the older equipment has been placed in the possession of the Casa do Povo da Ribeirinha.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===

Ribeirinha lies within two morphological formations, the ancient &quot;Ribeirinha Volcanic Complex&quot;, and the more recent &quot;Pedro Miguel Graben&quot; structure. The ancient Ribeirinha Volcanic Complex includes lava flows intermixed with heavily altered pyroclastic deposits and, in the western part of the parish, covered in pumice and ash from more recent volcanic events produced by the central volcano. Although there exist no volcanic structures, the region is vulnerable to the products from any central eruption on the island and peaks, such as Tambroso.

The parish is crossed by important geological faults: &quot;Chã da Crus Fault&quot; (reactivated during the 9 July 1998 earthquake), the &quot;Ribeirinha-Espalhaftos Fault&quot; and the &quot;Carapeto Fault&quot; oriented along a north-northwest to south-southeast alignment. Gaspar et al. (1998) consider the possibility of a structural fault, aligned northeast to southwest coincident with the Ribeirinha-Espalhafatos Fault that occurred during the 1998 earthquake.

===Human geography===
The community itself is divided into areas located within the Ribeirinha river-valley, and portions that are situated on several mountains and escarpments overlooking the same: Ribeirinha and Espalhafatos. Administratively, Riberinha is divided by borders along &quot;Lomba Grande&quot; (543 metres) and &quot;Lomba da Ribeira&quot; (209 metres) oriented west to east (both covered with many endemic species of plants, shrubs and trees natural to the Azores). Towards the interior, the plateau &quot;Trás-da-Serra&quot; is a feature of volcanic origins, as well as a protected countryside comprising many farmlands and diverse natural views.

The sheltered port of Boca da Ribeira is one of the oldest fishing ports found in the northernmost point of the Faial Channel.

On 22 March 2012, a private day centre for seniors was inaugurated, to support a maximum of 30 people in the community of Espalhafatos, an area with access to both northern and eastern residents. Built in order to meet the local needs and remove seniors&#x27; dependency, the building was opened by &quot;Optimus Senium&quot;, a local company that took advantage of a vacated restaurant in order to provide meals, transport of the elderly, care and comfort, medical support, nursing and physiotherapic care, as well as stimulating activities of a socio-cultural and psycho-social nature.

==Architecture==
Through successive use and re-use Ribeirinha has maintained a small group of architecturally significant buildings. The effects from earthquakes and inundation along the &quot;Riberia da Ribeirinha&quot; has made a historical catalogue of these structures difficult.

===Civic===
* Lighthouse of Ribeirinha (), a third-order coastal lighthouse, destroyed and now in ruins after the 1980 Azores Islands earthquake;

===Religious===
* Church of São Mateus (), another historical church destroyed during the 1980 earthquake; most of the eastern facade has been carved away, revealing the complete interior of the temple;
* Império of the Holy Spirit (), or &quot;Yellow Império&quot;, is an elevated two-storey império used in the celebrations of the Cult of the Holy Spirit annually, and located alongside the &quot;Ribeira da Ribeirinha&quot;, not far from the cemetery and church.

<text>Salão is a &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) in the municipality of Horta on the island of Faial, the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 401, in an area of 10.40 km².

==History==
The settlement of Salão can be traced back to 1620, to a Castilian family that moved there from the adjacent community of Santa Bárbara (now the area of &quot;Praça&quot; in Cedros). The family originally settled there in 1589, but after an acrimonious disagreement between neighbors, the family moved farther south. They constructed a new home in the zone that would be referred to as &quot;Carapeta&quot;; &quot;Carapeta&quot; (or &quot;Carapeto&quot;) is a disused term referring to &quot;one who makes lies or liars&quot;.

The nucleus of what would develop into Salão started in Carapeta, around the river-valleys that crossed the area. A local fountain () supported the small community (of mostly Spanish settlers) in its infancy, until it was destroyed in the 1926 earthquake. They brought to the island their worship of &quot;Nossa Senhora do Perpétuo Socorro&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Perpetual Help/Aid&quot;); a statue was brought from Spain, specifically. The statue was 80 cm tall, can completely covered in gold leaf. Years later the statue was removed and placed in the hands of a local family from Canto, whom conserved the image for many years.

By 1640, with the dissolution of the Iberian Union, the Spanish were expelled by inhabitants of Cedros. As the story goes, masked and armed residents of Cedros with pitchforks, sickles, knives and hoes, ordered the local residents to collect their clothing and leave the parish. Driving them towards Horta, the Cedrenses accompanied the Spanish as far as &quot;Alto da Ribeirinha&quot; (in the neighboring parish of Ribeirinha). As they returned from the expulsion, the inhabitants discovered many of the Spanish clothing lying along the route. From there on, the area became known as &quot;Espalhafatos&quot; which literally means &quot;scattered suits&quot;, referring to the ornamented clothing found scattered along the route.

But settlers continued into the area, settling in communities such as Lomba, Barreiro, Cela and Canto: by 1730, Salão became a civil parish. A church, the &quot;Church of Nossa Senhora do Socorro&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Help/Aid&quot;) was constructed in 1780, to replace the older 1727 chapel. It was a simple sanctuary with a single nave and altar, and 24.2 meters (length) by 10.12 meters (wide) dimensions. In 1834, the church received three golden altarpieces from the destroyed Convent of São João () in Horta, a new pulpit, and extensive remodeling to include two chapels dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora do Rosário&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Rosary&quot;) and &quot;Nossa Senhora das Dores&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Stigmata&quot;). This church survived until the 9 June 1998 earthquake that destroyed many of the bridges and homes in Salão.

Cela, another neighborhood in Salão, developed because of a nun who settled in the parish after the religious orders were ended in 1834. The nun constructed a simple small home, similar to her accommodations in the convent where she continued her worship until her death; in this context, &quot;Cela&quot; refers to &quot;cell&quot;, or, basically, the simple, stark chambers used by the nun for her living quarters in the convent. The area where she would live became known as Cela, because the local peoples referred to her home as &quot;Casa da Cela&quot; then &quot;the place of Cela&quot;.

At its height (1871), the population of Salão was 1,186 inhabitants in 285 homes. Since this period, it has slowly decreased due to emigration to North America. In 1962 there were 210 families, and 750 inhabitants. In 1970, it continued to fall to 585: the neighboring parish (Riberinha) had a greater population.

Canalized water only appeared in the parish as of 28 May 1948, a second fountain was also inaugurated on 26 July 1950.

==Geography==
Salão (also referred to as Solão historically) derives its name from the term for a mixture of clay, sand and tephra derived from pyroclastic projectiles. The zone of Salão, which occupies the space between the Riberinha Graben and Cedros Plateau is an area of deposits of lapilli particulars, or tephra projectiles smaller than 64 mm. The name Salão refers to the historical local common name for these materials; in current Portuguese taxonomy, Salão, literally means &quot;large hall&quot; or &quot;living room&quot;, and the reference to volcanic ejecta is not familiar.

The parish is located on the north coast of Faial, between Riberinha and Cedros, linked to other communities by the Regional Road E.R. 1-1ª, that encircles the island and connects it to the city of Horta. The parish is composed of several &quot;communities&quot; (similar to neighborhoods) that include Canada do Arrabalde, Canada do Barão, Canada da Dona Catarina, Canada do Mestre, Carapeto de Baixo, Carapeto de Cima and Salão.

===Ecoregions/Protected areas===
One of the primary areas of environmental protection is the &quot;Parque Florestal do Cabouco Velho&quot; (&quot;Forest Park of Cabouco Velho&quot;), located in Alta, in the civil parish. An area of 5 hectares, the park provides areas for picnicking, with grills and washrooms, in an area protected to conserve the endemic plants and fauna. Today, the &quot;Parque de Campismo&quot;(&quot;camping park&quot;) adds another layer to local activities and tourist attractions of the island, providing areas to camp, grills and public washrooms for traveling hikers and tourists.

== Economy ==
Historically, Saloenses cultivated small gardens and parcels near their homes. Crops cultivated in these hortas were common and sweet potatoes, beans, peas, local yam and taro, as well as fruit trees (such as oranges, lemons, apples, figs, cherries, tangerines and apricots).

In addition to agriculture, the Saloenses dedicate their resources to the fishery. At one time two whaling boats were docked in porto of Salão, being one of the first whaling ports in the Azores. A whaling company, Companhia Baleeira Saloense, grew due to the ideal whaling waters between the islands of São Jorge and Graciosa. The ending of commercial whaling resulted in the refocusing of the community to subsistence fishing and agriculture, as well as the dairy industry.

<doc id="1173688" wikidata="Q4952089" url="?curid=1173688" title="Catherine Hall">
<text>Catherine Hall (born 1946) is a British academic. She is Emerita Professor of Modern British Social and Cultural History at University College London and chair of its digital scholarship project, the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery. Her work as a feminist historian focuses on the 18th and 19th centuries, and the themes of gender, class, race, and empire.

==Early life and education==
Catherine Barrett (later Hall) was born in 1946 in Kettering, Northamptonshire. Her father, John Barrett, was a Baptist minister, while her mother, Gladys, came from a family of millers. Her parents met at Oxford University, where Gladys was studying history. When Catherine was three years old, the family moved to Leeds, Yorkshire, and she grew up there in a non-conformist household; both parents were &quot;radical Labour&quot;. She went to grammar school, where she says she had an excellent education.

She then attended the University of Sussex at Falmer, but was living between Brighton and London, having met her future husband, Stuart Hall, who lived in London. She found herself out of place among the &quot;stylish, metropolitan types&quot; and bewildered by the emphasis on the multidisciplinary syllabus at Sussex. She moved to the University of Birmingham, where Stuart had moved to set up the Centre for Cultural Studies, and she completed a traditional history degree, developing an interest in medieval history.

==Advocacy and other interests==

Hall was involved in student politics and activism in Birmingham around 1968, but then had a baby, which changed her life. She got involved in the women&#x27;s movement, became a feminist historian, and co-wrote &quot;Family Fortunes&quot; with Leonore Davidoff in 1987.

In the early 1960s, she participated in a march for Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

In 1970, Hall attended the UK&#x27;s first National Women&#x27;s Liberation Conference at Ruskin College, Oxford. She was a member of the &quot;Feminist Review&quot; collective between 1981 and 1997.

==Academic career==
Hall is a feminist historian, known for her work on gender, class, race and empire between 1700 and 1900.

She was employed as a &quot;gender historian&quot; at the Northeast London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) in the late 1980s, which involved looking at history from a feminist perspective, creating a new discipline subsequently known as feminist history. During this time, the discipline of postcolonialism developed, and she became interested in this topic.

She was appointed Professor of Modern British Social and Cultural History University College London (UCL) in 1998, and was Principal Investigator of the &quot;Legacies of British Slave Ownership&quot; and &quot;Structure and Significance of British-Caribbean Slave Ownership, 1763–1833&quot; research projects. She retired from her professorship on 31 July 2016. 

, she is Emerita Professor of Modern British Social and Cultural History at UCL and chair of its digital scholarship project, the Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slavery, on which she has worked since 2009.

==Awards and recognition==
*2002: Morris D. Forkosch Prize in British History
*2016: Offered the Dan David Prize from the Dan David Foundation in Tel Aviv, Israel, which included a £225,000 research fund; however, in support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement in, Hall rejected the award, stating that it was &quot;an independent political choice&quot; to do so.
* 2018: elected Fellow of the British Academy (FBA)
* 2019: Honorary degree from the University of York
*2021: Leverhulme Medal, awarded by the British Academy &quot;in recognition of Professor Hall&#x27;s impact across modern and contemporary British history, particularly in the fields of class, gender, empire and postcolonial history&quot;

==Personal life==
Hall met her future husband, cultural theorist and activist Stuart Hall, on a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament march in the early 1960s, and the two would go on to marry in 1964. The couple had a daughter, Becky, and son, Jess, and the family lived in Birmingham. Stuart was Jamaican, and with mixed-race children, Catherine was aware of the legacy of British colonialism before commencing her academic work on the topic.

Stuart died in 2014. In May 2016, Hall donated 3,000 books from his library to Housmans bookshop.

<text>A stress fracture is a fatigue-induced bone fracture caused by repeated stress over time. Instead of resulting from a single severe impact, stress fractures are the result of accumulated injury from repeated submaximal loading, such as running or jumping. Because of this mechanism, stress fractures are common overuse injuries in athletes.

Stress fractures can be described as small cracks in the bone, or hairline fractures. Stress fractures of the foot are sometimes called &quot;march fractures&quot; because of the injury&#x27;s prevalence among heavily marching soldiers. Stress fractures most frequently occur in weight-bearing bones of the lower extremities, such as the tibia and fibula (bones of the lower leg), calcaneus (heel bone), metatarsal and navicular bones (bones of the foot). Less common are stress fractures to the femur, pelvis, sacrum, lumbar spine (lower back), hips, hands, and writs. Stress fractures make up about 20% of overall sports injuries. Treatment usually consists of rest followed by a gradual return to exercise over a period of months.

==Signs and symptoms==
Stress fractures are typically discovered after a rapid increase in exercise. Symptoms usually have a gradual onset, with complaints that include isolated pain along the shaft of the bone and during activity, decreased muscular strength and cramping. In cases of fibular stress fractures, pain occurs proximal to the lateral malleolus, that increases with activity and subsides with rest. If pain is constantly present it may indicate a more serious bone injury. There is usually an area of localized tenderness on or near the bone and generalized swelling in the area. Pressure applied to the bone may reproduce symptoms and reveal crepitus in well-developed stress fractures. Anterior tibial stress fractures elicit focal tenderness on the anterior tibial crest, while posterior medial stress fractures can be tender at the posterior tibial border.

==Causes==

Bones are constantly attempting to remodel and repair themselves, especially during a sport where extraordinary stress is applied to the bone. Over time, if enough stress is placed on the bone that it exhausts the capacity of the bone to remodel, a weakened site—a stress fracture—may appear on the bone. The fracture does not appear suddenly. It occurs from repeated traumas, none of which is sufficient to cause a sudden break, but which, when added together, overwhelm the osteoblasts that remodel the bone.

Potential causes include overload caused by muscle contraction, amenorrhea, an altered stress distribution in the bone accompanying muscle fatigue, a change in ground reaction force (concrete to grass) or the performance of a rhythmically repetitive stress that leads up to a vibratory summation point.

Stress fractures commonly occur in sedentary people who suddenly undertake a burst of exercise (whose bones are not used to the task). They may also occur in athletes completing high volume, high impact training, such as running or jumping sports. Stress fractures are also commonly reported in soldiers who march long distances.

Muscle fatigue can also play a role in the occurrence of stress fractures. In a runner, each stride normally exerts large forces at various points in the legs. Each shock—a rapid acceleration and energy transfer—must be absorbed. Muscles and bones serve as shock absorbers. However, the muscles, usually those in the lower leg, become fatigued after running a long distance and lose their ability to absorb shock. As the bones now experience larger stresses, this increases the risk of fracture.

Previous stress fractures have been identified as a risk factor. Along with history of stress fractures, a narrow tibial shaft, high degree of hip external rotation, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and pes cavus are common predisposing factors for stress fractures.

Common causes in sport that result in stress fractures include:
* Over training
* Going back to competition too soon after an injury or illness
* Going from one event to another without proper training for the second event
* Starting initial training too quickly
* Changing habits or the environment like training surface or shoes

==Diagnosis==
X-rays usually do not show evidence of new stress fractures, but can be used approximately three weeks after onset of pain when the bone begins to remodel. A CT scan, MRI, or 3-phase bone scan may be more effective for early diagnosis.

MRI appears to be the most accurate diagnostic test.

Tuning forks have been advocated as an inexpensive alternative for identifying the presence of stress fractures. The clinician places a vibrating tuning fork along the shaft of the suspected bone. If a stress fracture is present, the vibration would cause pain. This test has a low positive likelihood ratio and a high negative likelihood ratio meaning it should not be used as the only diagnostic method.

==Prevention==
Altering the biomechanics of training and training schedules may reduce the prevalence of stress fractures. Orthotic insoles have been found to decrease the rate of stress fractures in military recruits, but it is unclear whether this can be extrapolated to the general population or athletes. On the other hand, some athletes have argued that cushioning in shoes actually causes more stress by reducing the body&#x27;s natural shock-absorbing action, thus increasing the frequency of running injuries. During exercise that applies more stress to the bones, it may help to increase daily calcium (2,000 mg) and vitamin D (800 IU) intake, depending on the individual.

==Treatment==
For low-risk stress fractures, rest is the best management option. The amount of recovery time varies greatly depending upon the location and severity of the fracture, and the body&#x27;s healing response. Complete rest and a stirrup leg brace or walking boot are usually used for a period of four to eight weeks, although periods of rest of twelve weeks or more are not uncommon for more-severe stress fractures. After this period, activities may be gradually resumed as long as the activities do not cause pain. While the bone may feel healed and not hurt during daily activity, the process of bone remodeling may take place for many months after the injury feels healed. Instances of refracturing the bone are still a significant risk. Activities such as running or sports that place additional stress on the bone should only gradually be resumed. Rehabilitation usually includes muscle strength training to help dissipate the forces transmitted to the bones.

With severe stress fractures (see &quot;prognosis&quot;), surgery may be needed for proper healing. The procedure may involve pinning the fracture site, and rehabilitation can take up to six months.

== Prognosis ==
Anterior tibial stress fractures can have a particularly poor prognosis and can require surgery. On radiographic imaging, these stress fractures are referred to as the &quot;dreaded black line.&quot; When compared to other stress fractures, anterior tibial fractures are more likely to progress to complete fracture of the tibia and displacement. Superior femoral neck stress fractures, if left untreated, can progress to become complete fractures with avascular necrosis, and should also be managed surgically. Proximal metadiaphyseal fractures of the fifth metatarsal (middle of the outside edge of the foot) are also notorious for poor bone healing. These stress fractures heal slowly with significant risk of refracture.

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, the annual incidence of stress fractures in athletes and military recruits ranges from 5% to 30%, depending on the sport and other risk factors. Women and highly active individuals are also at a higher risk. The incidence probably also increases with age due to age-related reductions in bone mass density (BMD). Children may also be at risk because their bones have yet to reach full density and strength. The female athlete triad also can put women at risk as disordered eating and osteoporosis can cause the bones to be severely weakened.

This type of injury is mostly seen in lower extremities, due to the constant weight-bearing (WB). The bones commonly affected by stress fractures are the tibia, tarsals, metatarsals (MT), fibula, femur, pelvis and spine. Upper extremity stress fractures occur less frequently and are usually created in the upper torso by muscle forces.

The population that has the highest risk for stress fractures is athletes and military recruits who are participating in repetitive, high intensity training. Sports and activities that have excessive, repetitive ground reaction forces have the highest incidence of stress fractures. The site at which the stress fracture occurs depends on the activity/sports that the individual participates in.

Women are more at risk for stress fractures than men due to factors such as lower aerobic capacity, reduced muscle mass, lower bone mineral density, among other anatomical and hormone-related elements. Women also have a two- to four-times increased risk of stress fractures when they have amenorrhea compared to women who are eumenorrheic. Reduced bone health increases the risk of stress fractures and studies have shown an inverse relationship between bone mineral density and stress fracture occurrences. This condition is most notable and commonly seen on the femoral neck.

==Other animals==
===Dinosaurs===

In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists published a study examining evidence for stress fractures in theropod dinosaurs and analyzed the implications such injuries would have for reconstructing their behavior. Since stress fractures are due to repeated events they are probably caused by expressions of regular behavior rather than chance trauma. The researchers paid special attention to evidence of injuries to the hand since dinosaurs&#x27; hind feet would be more prone to injuries received while running or migrating. Hand injuries, meanwhile, were more likely to be caused by struggling prey. Stress fractures in dinosaur bones can be identified by looking for bulges on the shafts of bones that face toward the front of the animal. When X-rayed, these bulges often show lines of clear space where the X-rays have a harder time traveling through the bone. Rothschild and the other researchers noted that this &quot;zone of attenuation&quot; seen under the X-ray typically cannot be seen with the naked eye.

The researchers described theropod phalanges as being &quot;pathognomonic&quot; for stress fractures; this means they are &quot;characteristic and unequivocal diagnostically”. Rothschild and the other researchers examined and dismissed other kinds of injury and sickness as causes of the lesions they found on the dinosaurs&#x27; bones. Lesions left by stress fractures can be distinguished from osteomyelitis without difficulty because of a lack of bone destruction in stress fracture lesions. They can be distinguished from benign bone tumors like osteoid osteoma by the lack of a sclerotic perimeter. No disturbance of the internal bony architecture of the sort caused by malignant bone tumors was encountered among the stress fracture candidates. No evidence of metabolic disorders like hyperparathyroidism or hyperthyroidism was found in the specimens, either.

After examining the bones of many kinds of dinosaur the researchers noted that &quot;Allosaurus&quot; had a significantly greater number of bulges on the shafts of its hand and foot bones than the tyrannosaur &quot;Albertosaurus&quot;, or the ostrich dinosaurs &quot;Ornithomimus&quot; and &quot;Archaeornithomimus&quot;. Most of the stress fractures observed along the lengths of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; toe bones were confined to the ends closest to the hind foot, but were spread across all three major digits in &quot;statistically indistinguishable&quot; numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while a theropod was running it would have borne the most stress and should be most predisposed to develop stress fractures. The lack of such a bias in the examined fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey. They suggest that such injuries could occur as a result of the theropod trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The presence of stress fractures provide evidence for very active predation-based feeding rather than scavenging diets.

<doc id="1173691" wikidata="Q6275015" url="?curid=1173691" title="Jonbar hinge">
<text>In science-fiction criticism, a Jonbar hinge or Jonbar point is the fictional concept of a crucial point of divergence between two outcomes, especially in time-travel stories. It is sometimes referred to as a Jon Bar hinge or change-point.

==Origin==
The phrase is derived from the Jack Williamson novel &quot;The Legion of Time&quot; (serialized 1938, collected 1952). It refers to one action from its character John Barr, whose picking up of one of two objects (a magnet or a pebble) is a major turning point in history: choosing one will lead to a utopian civilization named Jonbar, while the other to the tyranny of the state of Gyronchi.

This crucial moment (about which other characters are forewarned and must act), is thus a &quot;Jonbar point&quot; in the novel&#x27;s timeline, a forking-place upon which hinges the rest of its history.

==Background==
Jonbar hinges often refer to small nondescript events that had an important effect on history, but time travel caused the outcome of the choice or event to be changed and to lead to a different future or to an alternate history. It can, however, refer to any kind of change in history without having to deal with time travel, as Paul Di Filippo used the term when he reviewed S. M. Stirling&#x27;s &quot;In the Courts of the Crimson Kings&quot;. In Michael Chabon&#x27;s &quot;The Yiddish Policemen&#x27;s Union&quot; the jonbar hinge was the death of the main opponent to the passing of the King-Havenner Bill, which would have allowed Jewish refugees to settle in Alaska. The jonbar hinge in &quot;Bring the Jubilee,&quot; Ward Moore&#x27;s 1953 novel of American Civil War alternate history, is the Confederate occupation of Little Round Top minutes before the Union&#x27;s attempt, which leads to Lee&#x27;s victory at the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg. 

The term is also used in describing an important upcoming event or decision, that humanity will need to make.

<doc id="1173696" wikidata="Q183088" url="?curid=1173696" title="Austro-Slavism">
<text>Austro-Slavism or Austrian Slavism was a political concept and program aimed to solve problems of Slavic peoples in the Austrian Empire. It was most influential among Czech liberals around the middle of the 19th century. First proposed by Karel Havlíček Borovský in 1846, as an opposition to the concept of pan-Slavism, it was further developed into a complete political program by Czech politician František Palacký. Austroslavism also found some support in other Slavic nations in the Austrian Empire, especially the Poles, Slovenes, Croats and Slovaks.

==Program==
Austro-Slavism envisioned peaceful cooperation between the smaller Slavic nations of Central Europe within the Habsburg monarchy not dominated by German-speaking elites. Palacký proposed a federation of eight national regions, with significant self-governance. After the suppression of the Czech revolution in Prague in June 1848, the program became irrelevant. The Austrian Empire transformed into Austria-Hungary (1867), honouring Hungarian, but not Slavic demands as part of the &quot;Ausgleich&quot;. This further weakened the position of Austro-Slavism, as did the dawn of the coercive policy of Magyarization during the 1880s.

As a political concept, however, Austro-Slavism persisted until the fall of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire in 1918. Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, who was heir presumptive to Emperor Franz Joseph, was a true believer in Austro-Slavism, which he felt was a necessary and long overdue reform if the Empire was to survive.

The Archduke&#x27;s reform plans, which were almost certainly sold to the Governments of Russia and Serbia by Colonel Alfred Redl, are believed, accordingly, to have played a major role in causing senior Pan-Slavist officers within the military intelligence service of Serbia to covertly plan the Archduke&#x27;s 1914 assassination in Sarajevo. Long before his death, however, the Archduke had passed his sympathies for Austro-Slavism and plans to return the Empire to Federalism down to his nephew, who went on to become the last Habsburg monarch: Emperor Charles I of Austria.

The 1918 collapse of Austria-Hungary owed a great deal to Emperor Charles&#x27; failure to implement Austro-Slavist reforms due to both foreign and domestic politicians and to the ongoing chaos of the First World War. Meanwhile, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, who was later to become the first President of Czechoslovakia, had successfully convinced U.S. President Woodrow Wilson during the First World War that the Slavic peoples of Austria-Hungary were oppressed and needed to be liberated. This, in turn, led directly to President Wilson&#x27;s rejection of the efforts of Emperor Charles I of Austria to return the Empire to federalism (such as the abortive United States of Greater Austria plan). President Wilson&#x27;s refusal to accept an end to the war on any other terms led directly to the collapse of the Empire in 1918.

<text>The Nueva Planta decrees (, , ) were a number of decrees signed between 1707 and 1716 by Philip V, the first Bourbon King of Spain, during and shortly after the end of the War of the Spanish Succession by the Treaty of Utrecht.

The Decrees put an end to the existence of the realms of the Crown of Aragon (Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia and Majorca) as separate entities within a composite monarchy and incorporated them into the Crown of Castile, thus abolishing the political differences of the two crowns and essentially establishing the Kingdom of Spain as a French-style absolute monarchy and a centralized state in the pre-liberal sense.

==Historical context==
Angered by what he saw as sedition by the realms of the Crown of Aragon, who had supported the claim of Charles of Austria to the Spanish thrones during the war and taking his native France as a model of a centralised state, Philip V suppressed the institutions, privileges, and the ancient charters (, ) of almost all the areas that were formerly part of the Crown of Aragon, the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Valencia, and the Kingdom of Majorca. The decrees ruled that all the territories in the Crown of Aragon except the Aran Valley were to be ruled by the laws of Castile (&quot;the most praiseworthy in all the Universe&quot; according to the 1707 decree), embedding those regions into a new and nearly uniformly administered, centralised Spain.

The other historic territories (Navarre and the other Basque territories) supported Philip V initially, whom they saw as belonging to the lineage of Henry III of Navarre, but after Philip V&#x27;s military campaign to crush the Basque uprising, he backed down on his intent to suppress home rule.

The acts abolishing the charters were promulgated in 1707 in the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon, in 1715 in the Kingdom of Majorca and in 1716 in the Principality of Catalonia.

==Effects==
The decrees effectively created a centralized Spanish state and Spanish citizenship by abolishing all legal distinctions between the Castilians and the Aragonese, Catalans, Valencians and Majorcans. One of the main goals of the decrees was the replacement of the administrative and public law of each entity of the Crown of Aragon. The consequence was the abolition of the political institutions that they developed over the previous centuries, including their representative and legislative bodies, the Courts of Aragon, the Courts of Catalonia and the Courts of Valencia. From that point on, the members of the abolished Courts were summoned to the Cortes of Castile, now operating as the unified Cortes of Spain, except in Navarra.

The decrees erased all internal borders and tariffs except for the Basque territory and granted all citizens of the newly created Spanish state the right to trade with the American and Asian colonies, which henceforth were no longer the exclusive domain of the Crown of Castile.

The top civil servants were to be appointed directly from Madrid, and most institutions in what had become subnational entities were abolished. Court cases could also be presented and argued only in Castilian, which became the sole language of government and displaced Latin, Catalan and the other languages of Spain. However, the application of Castilian as a single administrative language had one exception in the Vizcaya Chamber of the Valladolid Court, where the use of Basque was permitted.

<text>The Black Cauldron (1965) is a high fantasy novel by American writer Lloyd Alexander, the second of five volumes in &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot;. The story continues the adventures of Taran, the Assistant Pig-Keeper, as he joins in a quest to capture the eponymous Magical Cauldron from Arawn Death-Lord. It was a Newbery Honor book in 1966, runner-up for the year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;.

The book provided a title and many plot elements for the 1985 Disney animated feature &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot;.

==Origins==
The series was inspired by Welsh mythology and by the castles, scenery, and language of Wales, which the author experienced during World War II combat intelligence training.

At one stage of planning, it was a trilogy with titles &quot;The Battle of the Trees&quot;, &quot;The Lion with the Steady Hand&quot;, and &quot;Little Gwion&quot;.

==Plot summary==
More than a year after the defeat of Arawn Death-Lord&#x27;s army and death of his warlord the Horned King, Prince Gwydion calls allies to a council hosted by Dallben, one of Taran&#x27;s guardians. Men are disappearing throughout Prydain, while an increasing number of the undead Cauldron-Born have joined Arawn&#x27;s forces. At the council, Gwydion reveals an elaborate plan to steal the Black Cauldron, the magical artifact used to create the Cauldron-Born, from Arawn. King Morgant will lead the main force in an attack on Arawn&#x27;s stronghold of Annuvin, while a smaller raiding party led by Gwydion breaks off to enter by a mountain pass known only to Coll that will allow them to steal the cauldron undetected. Three men have been designated to remain behind with pack animals to serve as a rearguard and secure the retreat: Adaon, the warrior son of chief bard Taliesin; Taran; and Ellidyr, Prince of Pen-Llarcau, who is arrogant, wiry, strong, and threadbare. Ellidyr disdains Taran for his place on the farm and his unknown parentage. Taran envies Ellidyr for his noble birth, despite Dallben&#x27;s counsel that that youngest son of a minor king has only &quot;his name and his sword&quot;. Both are dismayed to share a role with no chance for glory.

In spite of the growing feud between Taran and Ellidyr, all goes smoothly until Gwydion&#x27;s raiders find that the cauldron has disappeared. The company rejoins the rearguard in haste to escape the newly-deployed Huntsmen of Annuvin. Meanwhile, the uninvited Princess Eilonwy and man/beast Gurgi have caught up with the quest from behind. Gwydion and Coll are split off from the party but, thanks to Doli of the Fair Folk, all others find refuge underground in a Fair Folk waypost maintained by Gwystyl. From Gwystyl and his pet crow, Kaw, the companions learn that the cauldron has been stolen by the three witches Orddu, Orwen and Orgoch, who reside in the bleak Marshes of Morva. When they depart the waypost, Ellidyr rides southward, determined to retrieve the cauldron single-handedly. With the Huntsmen abroad, Adaon leads Taran, Eilonwy, Gurgi, Doli, and the wandering bard Fflewddur Fflam in pursuit of Ellidyr. When they are attacked and scattered, Adaon is mortally wounded and Taran inherits his brooch, whose gift and burden is prophetic dreams and visions. With its guidance, he gathers and leads all but Doli toward the Marshes. From the fringe, Taran guides his small party through the Marshes to temporary safety and leads a pursuing band of Huntsmen to their deaths.

Orddu and her sisters refuse to give up the cauldron unless Taran and his companions offer something of, in their judgment, equivalent value. After the sisters reject the magical artifacts offered by his companions, Taran is compelled to barter Adaon&#x27;s brooch. The companions then try to destroy the cauldron, but learn from the witches that it can only be destroyed by a living person who knowingly and willingly climbs in to die. Horrified, the companions resolve to take the cauldron to Dallben to seek an alternative solution.

At the ford of the river Tevyn, the heavy and cumbersome cauldron sinks into the riverbed. Ellidyr arrives and offers to help extricate the cauldron if the others will credit him for the whole enterprise. Taran agrees, but Ellidyr reneges on their bargain and rides off with the cauldron alone when they have freed it. The companions then encounter Morgant and his army. In Morgant&#x27;s camp they see Ellidyr beaten and bound and realize Morgant has betrayed them, seeking to claim the cauldron for his own and generate his own army of Cauldron-Born to conquer Prydain. Morgant offers to spare the companions&#x27; lives if Taran will enter his personal service. Doli arrives invisibly and cuts the companions&#x27; bonds. Mortally wounded, Ellidyr rushes the cauldron while Taran and the others engage Morgant and forces himself inside, destroying the cauldron. Gwydion, King Smoit, and his army arrive and defeat Morgant in battle. As Taran, Eilonwy, and Gurgi take leave of Gwydion at the verge of Caer Dallben, Gwydion observes that Ellidyr has, in death, found the honor he so dearly sought in life.

==Analysis==
Writing in &quot;Studies in the Literary Imagination&quot;, Melody Green analyzes &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; through René Girard&#x27;s description of the trope of scapegoating: in the novel, Ellidyr&#x27;s death is like a &quot;final scapegoat&quot;, argues Girard. The black cauldron, which can reanimate corpses, can only be destroyed from the inside by someone who dies in the process. While normally the scapegoat figure is innocent, Ellidyr is not. Instead, his willingness to be a sacrifice is more important. Ellidyr is made an outsider by his own jealousy and pride when he, Taran, and others are separated from the main army attacking the dark lord. Ellidyr leaves the group while they brave danger to retrieve the black cauldron. When they reunite, he tries to get the group to tell their leader, Gwydion, that he alone retrieved the black cauldron, much to the annoyance of his companions. After they agree to this plan, they are captured by another powerful lord, who wishes to make Taran&#x27;s group the first reanimated corpses with the cauldron. During the chaos after their prison break, Ellidyr decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the cauldron. Ellidyr&#x27;s sacrifice transforms his selfishness into selflessness. Taran and Gwydion determine that through losing his life, he gained honor.

==Adaptations==

&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was loosely adapted by Walt Disney Productions and released in 1985 as an animated feature film.
&quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; film was based primarily on the first two Prydain novels with elements from the others. It was the last Disney film produced before corporate reorganization created Walt Disney Feature Animation (later Walt Disney Animation Studios) as a separate division within the company, and the first to be rated &quot;PG&quot; rather than &quot;G&quot; in the United States by the MPAA. Disney&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; was considered a commercial failure because its gross receipts did not match production cost.

Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s reaction was twofold: &quot;First, I have to say, there is no resemblance between the movie and the book. Having said that, the movie in itself, purely as a movie, I found to be very enjoyable.&quot;

The movie inspired a 1986 computer video game with the same title.

<text>Dipesh Chakrabarty (born 1948, in Kolkata, India) is an Indian historian and leading scholar of postcolonial theory and subaltern studies. He is the Lawrence A. Kimpton Distinguished Service Professor in history at the University of Chicago, and is the recipient of the 2014 Toynbee Prize, named after Professor Arnold J. Toynbee, that recognizes social scientists for significant academic and public contributions to humanity. He is the author of the seminal &quot;Provincializing Europe: Postcolonial Thought and Historical Difference&quot; (2000).

The academic Christine Fair has accused Chakrabarty of making an inappropriate sexual comment during her time as a student in 1994. Fair also alleged that Chakrabarty made similar comments to others. The University of Chicago released a statement in 2017 inviting students to formally report such allegations. In 2021, the Graduate Employee&#x27;s Organization at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign protested the university&#x27;s decision to host Chakrabarty at a roundtable on criticism and interpretive theory, in response to Fair&#x27;s allegations.

<doc id="1173744" wikidata="Q168615" url="?curid=1173744" title="1080° Snowboarding">
<text>is a snowboarding video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 in 1998. In the game, players control one of five snowboarders from a third-person perspective, using a combination of buttons to jump and perform tricks across eight levels.

&quot;1080°&quot; was announced in November 1997 and developed over nine months. It received critical acclaim and won an Interactive Achievement Award from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. The game sold over two million units. A sequel, &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot;, was released for the GameCube in November 2003. The game was re-released for the Wii in 2008 and for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2016. It was also re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2023.

== Gameplay ==

Players control snowboarders in various modes. &quot;1080°&quot; features two trick modes (Trick Attack and Contest), three race modes (Race, Time Attack, and 2 Players), a Training mode, and an Options mode. The objective of the game is either to reach a level&#x27;s finish line as quickly as possible or to achieve the highest score by executing trick combinations.

In &quot;1080°&quot;&#x27;s two trick modes, Trick Attack and Contest, players earn points by completing tricks. In Contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags to gain points. In Trick Attack mode, players must perform a series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game includes 24 tricks and 5 secret tricks, all executed through combinations of circular movements of the control stick, along with the R, Z, and B buttons. Points are awarded based on the complexity of the tricks, combos, and the time required. The two categories of tricks are grab tricks, where the snowboarder grabs the board in a specific manner, and spin tricks, where the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin, the game&#x27;s most complex trick, requires nine distinct actions to perform.

&quot;1080°&quot; features three race modes. In these modes, players can achieve victory by selecting alternate routes within a course and balancing the snowboarder after jumps to avoid losing speed. Although tricks are scored in race modes, they do not contribute to winning.

In Match Race mode, the player competes in a series of races against AI-controlled snowboarders. The game tracks the player’s time throughout the level, and the player is assigned a damage meter that fills if the snowboarder falls or is knocked over. The difficulty level in Match Races can be set to normal, hard, or expert, affecting both the complexity and the number of races. If the player fails to defeat an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the AI before the game ends.

Players can initially choose from five snowboarders: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has unique abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, as they vary in statistics such as technique, speed, and weight.

Three additional snowboarders can be unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes. Players also start with eight snowboards available for every character, with one additional snowboard unlockable later in the game. Each snowboard is tailored to different situations, as they offer varying strengths in areas such as balance and edge control.

== Development and release ==
&quot;1080°&quot; release was announced on 21 November 1997 at Nintendo&#x27;s Space World trade show, with its working title previously being &quot;Vertical Edge Snowboarding&quot;. &quot;1080°&quot; was one of several snowboarding games released for the Nintendo 64 in 1998, alongside titles like &quot;Big Mountain 2000&quot; and &quot;Snowboard Kids&quot;. Before its official release, journalists were able to play &quot;1080°&quot; at the January 1998 Nintendo Gamers&#x27; Summit.

&quot;1080°&quot; was directed by Masamachi Abe and Misthuro Tanako, programmed by English developers Giles Goddard and Colin Reed, and developed and published by Nintendo. The game was produced by Shigeru Miyamoto. Abe had previously directed &quot;Tekken 3&quot; for Namco, while Goddard had programmed the Mario face in &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;, which was released two years earlier to critical and commercial success. Reed had previously programmed &quot;Stunt Race FX&quot;. According to Miyamoto, the game &quot;came about because I like skiing. I was thinking about making a skiing game after completing &quot;Wave Race [64]&quot;. However, the current trend seems to be toward snowboarding. With snowboarding, it seems that you can go places that you can&#x27;t with skis; for example, in between trees.&quot;

Development for &quot;1080°&quot; took place at Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters in Kyoto, Japan. During development, programmers Goddard and Reed used a technique called &quot;skinning&quot; to eliminate joints between the polygons that made up the characters. They combined standard animation with inverse kinematics to create characters whose responses during collisions varied depending on the object hit, the direction of the collision, and the speed of impact. All of the characters&#x27; movements were created using motion capture.

Tommy Hilfiger outfits and Lamar snowboards appear in &quot;1080°&quot; as part of its product placement. The game&#x27;s soundtrack, composed by Kenta Nagata, features a mix of &quot;techno and beats&quot; with &quot;thrashy, vocals.&quot;

Development for &quot;1080°&quot; started around April or May 1997 and continued into early 1998. The game was released in Japan on 28 February 1998 and in North America on 1 April. Nintendo prioritized releasing &quot;1080°&quot; in Japan while there was still snow on the ground. The European release was delayed to align with the winter season, hoping to boost sales. &quot;1080°&quot; was eventually released on 9 October 1998 in Europe and the PAL regions.

== Reception ==
&quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews,&quot; according to Metacritic, falling just two points short of &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; awarded it a score of 31 out of 40. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave a favorable review of the Japanese import over a month before the game&#x27;s U.S. release. Josh Smith from &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;one of the best values in both sports and racing gaming&quot;. The game was widely recognized as a leader among snowboarding titles at the time. &quot;Edge&quot; described it as the &quot;most convincing video game emulation of the snowboarding experience so far,&quot; noting its serious tone, which contrasted with other Nintendo games.

The game&#x27;s graphics were highly praised for their quality on the Nintendo 64. Smith lauded the graphics for their crispness, smoothness, and detail, with minimal polygon dropout. Reviewers also praised the game&#x27;s camera work, realistic physics model, and its depiction of speed. The game&#x27;s snow effects were particularly highlighted, as sun reflections varied appropriately between fluffy and packed snow, which also behaved differently in-game. Minor graphical issues, such as occasional pop-up, misplaced shadows, and slight lag when racers passed through trees, were noted but considered insignificant.

Although &quot;Edge&quot; gave &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; a generally positive review, it found faults with the game&#x27;s AI, accusing it of &quot;cheating&quot; due to its tendency to allow CPU opponents to quickly catch up near the end of races. The review also criticized the AI&#x27;s simplicity, noting that the CPU followed a &quot;limited series of predetermined routes,&quot; making it possible for players to predict when the AI would fall over, which allowed them to pass with little satisfaction. &quot;Edge&quot; also criticized the delay in the game&#x27;s PAL release, calling it &quot;frankly ludicrous&quot; and suggested that, with Nintendo&#x27;s limited number of major releases at the time, any quality title was likely to top the charts easily.

Other publications were more enthusiastic. &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; set the standard for the snowboarding genre, while &quot;Hyper&quot; compared it to how &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; revolutionized water-based racing, praising its ability to capture the excitement of snowboarding. Similarly, &quot;GamePro&quot; urged gamers to &quot;snap [the game] up as soon as it&#x27;s out.&quot;

The control scheme was another point of praise. Shawn Sackenheim of &quot;AllGame&quot; considered the game&#x27;s &quot;highly technical&quot; controls to be a strength, despite their initial difficulty. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewer Alex Huhtala agreed, praising the controls and dismissing the notion of difficulty, stating they were so well-implemented that &quot;you’re able to play perfectly well with just one hand on the stick and Z button.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; also complimented the &quot;thoroughly involving&quot; controls, emphasizing the crouch move for tight turns.

The game&#x27;s music was widely appreciated, with &quot;IGN&quot; describing it as &quot;a shining example of what can be achieved on the format,&quot; while Sackenheim called it &quot;one of the best N64 soundtracks to date.&quot; Both reviewers also praised the sound effects.

In a 2006 retrospective, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; hailed &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; for having the best video game representation of snow at the time and commended its sound effects and handling. Steve Jarratt described it as a &quot;stunt-free but fast and fun&quot; experience, highlighting its multiplayer quality. The magazine ranked it as the 87th best game available on Nintendo platforms, noting its realism as a snowboarding game.

&quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; received praise for its soundtrack, particularly its use of drum and bass music. In a 2023 retrospective, NME&#x27;s Mat Ombler commended the game&#x27;s soundtrack, noting that it helped introduce underground electronic club music, including drum and bass, to a broader audience, similar to the impact of the &quot;Wipeout&quot; series.

The game also earned critical accolades, winning the AIAS&#x27; Console Sports Game of the Year award at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. It was also nominated for Best Nintendo 64 Game at the 1998 &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; Awards, but lost to &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;.

Commercially, &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; was a significant success in the United States. According to &quot;PC Data&quot;, the game sold 817,529 units and generated $40.9 million in revenue by the end of 1998, making it the seventh-best-selling Nintendo 64 game of the year. Over its lifetime, the game sold 1,230,000 units in the U.S. and over 23,000 in Japan. However, it did not surpass the commercial success of the developers&#x27; previous game, &quot;Wave Race 64&quot;, which sold 1,950,000 units in the U.S. and 154,000 in Japan.

&quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot; was later re-released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service in 2008 and on the Wii U in 2016. It was also made available on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on December 7, 2023.

== Sequel ==
&quot;1080° Avalanche&quot;, the sequel to &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot;, was released for the GameCube in 2003. Unlike its predecessor, the sequel received mixed reviews. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; provided a more critical assessment, citing &quot;frame rate issues and limited gameplay&quot; as major drawbacks that detracted from the experience. Despite its graphical improvements and new features, &quot;1080° Avalanche&quot; was unable to match the critical success of the original &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot;.

<text>Penedo is a municipality in the state of Alagoas in Brazil. The population is 63,846 (2020 est.) in an area of . Penedo lies south-west of the state capital of Maceió.

In October 2023, Penedo joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and was named a UNESCO City of Film.

==History==
Founded in 1614, Penedo has many important examples of Portuguese and Dutch colonial architectures. The history of Penedo can be found in Francisco Alberto Sales&#x27;s book &quot;Arruando para o Forte&quot;. It was reached by sea from the wide estuary of the São Francisco River.

The unclassified extinct Wakoná language was formerly spoken in Penedo. Loukotka (1968) reported that the remaining ethnic descendants who speak only Portuguese could be found in the city of Porto Real do Colégio.

==Architectural heritage==
Among its historically significant buildings are its well preserved churches, which were built through the 18th century. Some of these include:
* Convento de São Francisco e Igreja de Nossa Senhora dos Anjos&lt;br&gt;(&quot;Convent of Saint Francis and Church of Our Lady of the Angels&quot;)
* Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Corrente &lt;br&gt; (&quot;Church of Our Lady of the Chains&quot;)
* Catedral de Nossa Senhora do Rosário dos Pretos, Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Penedo. &lt;br&gt;(&quot;Cathedral of Our Lady of the Black People&#x27;s Rosary&quot;)

The Casa do Penedo, built in 1974, has as its objective the preservation of the city&#x27;s artistic and cultural patrimony. In the Casa do Penedo one can find a rich quantity of five centuries of creativity by residents of the São Francisco River Valley.

==In literature==

Penedo is the location in &quot;The Far Side of the World&quot;, a novel by Patrick O&#x27;Brian set in the era when both the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars were underway, where HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; pulls in for repairs. The ship stays longer than expected when she gets stuck in the river due to its rapidly changing tides.

<text>William Dowsing (1596–1668), also known as &quot;Smasher Dowsing&quot;, was an English puritan, and a particularly notable iconoclast at the time of the English Civil War. He was mainly active in East Anglia.

==Life==
William Dowsing was born in Laxfield, Suffolk, the son of Wollfran and Johane Dowsing of that place. In August 1643 Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester appointed Dowsing provost-marshal of the armies of the Eastern Association (Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk, Norfolk, Hertfordshire, Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire), responsible for supplies and administration.

In December 1643 the Earl, as their captain-general, appointed him &quot;Commissioner for the destruction of monuments of idolatry and superstition&quot;. He was to carry out a Parliamentary Ordinance of 28 August 1643 which stated that &quot;all Monuments of Superstition and Idolatry should be removed and abolished&quot;. These were specified as &quot;fixed altars, altar rails, chancel steps, crucifixes, crosses, images and pictures of any one of the persons of the Trinity and of the Virgin Mary, and pictures of saints or superstitious inscriptions.&quot; In May 1644 the scope of the ordinance was widened to include representations of angels (a particular obsession of Dowsing&#x27;s), rood lofts, holy water stoups, and images in stone, wood and glass and on plate.

Dowsing carried out his work in 1643–44 by visiting over 250 churches in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, including several of the college chapels in the University of Cambridge, removing or defacing items that he thought fitted the requirements outlined in the ordinance. John Barwick complained of&quot;one who calls himself Iohn Dowsing, [who] by vertue of a pretended Commission goes about the Country like a Bedlam breaking glasse windowes, having battered and beaten downe all our painted glasse, not only in our Chapples, but (contrary to Order) in our publique Schooles, Colledge Halls, Libraryes, and Chambers, mistaking perhaps the liberall Arts for Saints... and having (against an Order) defaced and digged up the floors of our Chappels, many of which had lien so for two or three hundred yeares together, not regarding the dust of our founders and predecessors, who likely were buried there; compelled us by armed Souldiers to pay forty shillings a Colledge for not mending what he had spoyled and defaced, or forthwith to go to Prison&quot;

He recruited assistants, apparently among his friends and family. Where they were unable to perform the work themselves, he left instructions for the work to be carried out by others. Sometimes the local inhabitants assisted his work, but often he was met by resistance or non-co-operation. His commission, backed up by the authority to call on military force if necessary, meant that he usually got his way. He charged each church a noble (one third of a pound) for his services. Dowsing&#x27;s commission was at the instance and under the direction of the Earl of Manchester. It therefore ceased when his patron fell out with Oliver Cromwell in late 1644.

Dowsing is unique among the iconoclasts at work during this period because he left journals recording much of what he did. They contain many detailed entries such as this one dated Haverhill, Suffolk, 6 January 1644:&quot;We broke down about a hundred superstitious Pictures; and seven Fryars hugging a Nunn; and the Picture of God and Christ; and divers others very superstitious; and 200 had been broke down before I came. We took away 2 popish Inscriptions with &quot;Ora pro nobis&quot; and we beat down a great stoneing Cross on the top of the Church.&quot; Versions of the journals are available on-line, and are collected and interpreted in the modern edition by Trevor Cooper.

A portrait of him has been identified in the collections of the Colchester and Ipswich Museums Service at Wolsey Art Gallery, Ipswich.

<doc id="1173771" wikidata="Q6971114" url="?curid=1173771" title="National Braille Association">
<text>The National Braille Association, Inc. (NBA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization headquartered in Rochester, New York. The association assists, educates, and certifies transcribers and narrators producing reading materials for the visually impaired, and provides braille materials to persons who are print handicapped at below cost. It is a member of the Braille Authority of North America. 

== History ==
The organization was founded in 1945 in New York City as the &quot;National Braille Club&quot;. At the time, there weren&#x27;t many standards or direct guidelines for someone to follow while preparing braille. In an effort to standardize the process, the National Braille Club sought to provide training so that transcribers across the country were all providing similarly formatted materials.

In 1946 the organization began publishing the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, a quarterly peer-reviewed journal of skills articles intended to provide technical instruction to those transcribing braille.

In 1957 the National Braille Club began holding conferences where braille transcribers from around North America would collect in person and receive training. Since then the conferences have been adjusted slightly in format and frequency. In 2020 it was hosted using a virtual platform for the first time ever.

In 1964 the National Braille Club was renamed to the &quot;National Braille Association&quot;. Soon after, they would form the Braille Book Bank located in New Jersey. The book bank provided transcribed reading materials for readers all over the United States.

Later in the early 2000s, the book bank and transcription service were discontinued, as there were many transcribing groups and braille publishing houses around the country, but few training organizations. Rather than attempt to manage both efforts, NBA chose to focus exclusively on training.

== Services ==

=== Professional development ===

Since 1957 the organization has been hosting in person conferences where braille transcribers attend trainings taught by experts from around North America. The frequency and format of the conferences has been adjusted over the years, but it has traditionally focused on providing classroom style training for transcribers on various topics. In recent decades, the conferences have primarily been either a three-day or two and a half day schedule, with workshop sessions in the mornings and afternoons.

Historically, conference attendance was only open to members, as some of the meal functions also serve as membership meetings. That rule was later adjusted and non-members are now invited to attend, though meal functions often still include membership votes like the installation of new officers to the board of directors.

In addition to providing trainings during Professional Development Conferences, trainers can be hired to travel directly to a site and provide customized education on an array of topics.

=== Training publications ===
Some workshops from previous conferences have been redeveloped into standalone training manuals and are available in print, and ebook.

=== Membership services ===
The organization is member-supported, with dues paying members primarily existing in the United States. There are some Canadian members and a few from other countries. Members gain access to educational tools like a peer-reviewed journal of skills articles, a technical support forum, an archive of training videos, and more.

=== Braille formats and textbook certification ===
NBA is the only organization that certifies transcribers in the &quot;Principles of Print to Braille Transcription&quot; formats guidelines published by the Braille Authority of North America. The exam process consists of a transcriber taking a mini-textbook and transcribing it using the most recent Textbook/Formats guidelines.

=== Lifetime Achievement Award ===
Since 2011 the National Braille Association has selected a single recipient each year to be awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award. Nominations for the award can be submitted by anyone who wishes to nominate a person they feel has made a significant contribution to braille through their work.

<text>Lindsey Audrey Jennifer Hughes (4 May 1949 – 26 April 2007) was a British historian who studied seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Russia, especially the reign of Peter the Great. She wrote biographies of Peter and his predecessor Sophia Alekseyevna, as well as a more general work, &quot;Russia in the Age of Peter the Great&quot;. She also wrote prolifically on art history.

==Biography==
Lindsey Hughes was born 4 May 1949. She joined the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (which later joined University College London) in 1987, became a reader in 1992 and a professor of Russian history in 1997.

Hughes wrote two books on Peter the Great. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Russia in the Age of Peter the Great&quot; (1998) &quot;a scholar&#x27;s compilation, so organized -- with its full index and bibliography, lengthy chronology of events and topical arrangement of chapters and sections -- as to facilitate ready reference, the whole attractively printed with an absolute minimum of gaffes, all as befits the leading British authority on the subject and her distinguished publisher.&quot;

In a review of her book &quot;Peter the Great: A Biography&quot; (2002), a review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said that the book &quot;will likely become a standard for scholars and students who want a short but comprehensive account of Peter the Great.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Orlando Figes says, &quot;In her splendid new biography, Lindsey Hughes... brings us closer to the true face of the Tsar. In the preface she modestly describes the book as a small companion to her panoramic social history, &quot;Russia in the Age of Peter the Great&quot; (1998); and in places where evidence about his life is thin, there is unavoidably some cut-and-paste from it. Yet the effect is always to enrich and clarify her picture of this fascinating Tsar.&quot;

Hughes died of cancer, aged 57, on 26 April 2007.

<text>The psychedelic era was the time of social, musical and artistic change influenced by psychedelic drugs, occurring from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. The era was defined by the proliferation of LSD and its following influence in the development of psychedelic music and psychedelic film in the Western world.

Writers who explored the potentials of consciousness exploration in the psychedelic era included Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Ram Dass among others; an important journal of the time was &quot;The Psychedelic Review&quot;.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Throughout the 1950s, mainstream media reported on research into LSD and its growing use in psychiatry, and undergraduate psychology students taking LSD as part of their education described the effects of the drug. &quot;Time&quot; magazine published six positive reports on LSD between 1954 and 1959.

From the second half of the 1950s, Beat Generation writers like William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg wrote about and took drugs, including cannabis and Benzedrine, raising awareness and helping to popularise their use. In the early 1960s, the use of LSD and other psychedelics was advocated by new proponents of consciousness expansion such as Timothy Leary, Alan Watts, Aldous Huxley and Arthur Koestler, and, according to Laurence Veysey, they profoundly influenced the thinking of the new generation of youth.

=== Cultural influence ===
The psychedelic lifestyle had already developed in California, particularly in San Francisco, by the mid-1960s, with the first major underground LSD factory established by Owsley Stanley. From 1964, the Merry Pranksters, a loose group that developed around novelist Ken Kesey, sponsored the Acid Tests, a series of events involving the taking of LSD (supplied by Stanley), accompanied by light shows, film projection and discordant, improvised music by the Grateful Dead (financed by Stanley), then known as the Warlocks, known as the &quot;psychedelic symphony&quot;. The Pranksters helped popularise LSD use, through their road trips across America in a psychedelically decorated converted school bus, which involved distributing the drug and meeting with major figures of the beat movement, and through publications about their activities such as Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot; (1968).

San Francisco had an emerging music scene of folk clubs, coffee houses and independent radio stations that catered to the population of students at nearby Berkeley and the free thinkers that had gravitated to the city. There was already a culture of drug use among jazz and blues musicians, and in the early 1960s use of drugs including cannabis, peyote, mescaline and LSD began to grow among folk and rock musicians. One of the first musical uses of the term &quot;psychedelic&quot; in the folk scene was by the New York-based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly&#x27;s &#x27;Hesitation Blues&#x27; in 1964. Folk/avant-garde guitarist John Fahey recorded several songs in the early 1960s experimented with unusual recording techniques, including backwards tapes, and novel instrumental accompaniment including flute and sitar. His nineteen-minute &quot;The Great San Bernardino Birthday Party&quot; &quot;anticipated elements of psychedelia with its nervy improvisations and odd guitar tunings&quot;. Similarly, folk guitarist Sandy Bull&#x27;s early work &quot;incorporated elements of folk, jazz, and Indian and Arabic-influenced dronish modes&quot;. His album &quot;Fantasias for Guitar and Banjo&quot; (1963) explores various styles and &quot;could also be accurately described as one of the very first psychedelic records&quot;.

Soon musicians began to refer (at first indirectly, and later explicitly) to the drug and attempted to recreate or reflect the experience of taking LSD in their music, just as it was reflected in psychedelic art, literature and film. This trend ran in parallel in both America and Britain and as part of the interconnected folk and rock scenes. As pop music began incorporating psychedelic sounds, the genre emerged as a mainstream and commercial force. Psychedelic rock reached its peak in the last years of the decade. From 1967 to 1968, it was the prevailing sound of rock music, either in the whimsical British variant, or the harder American West Coast acid rock. In America, the 1967 Summer of Love was prefaced by the Human Be-In event and reached its peak at the Monterey International Pop Festival. These trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock Festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts, including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jefferson Airplane and Santana.

By the end of the 1960s, the trend of exploring psychedelia in music was largely in retreat. LSD was declared illegal in the United States and the United Kingdom in 1966. The linking of the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by the Manson Family to Beatles songs such as &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; contributed to an anti-hippie backlash. The Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by The Rolling Stones and Jefferson Airplane on December 6, 1969, did not turn out to be a positive milestone in the psychedelic music scene, as was anticipated; instead, it became notorious for the fatal stabbing of a black teenager Meredith Hunter by Hells Angels security guards.

<doc id="1173799" wikidata="Q434818" url="?curid=1173799" title="Hayden White">
<text>Hayden V. White (July 12, 1928 – March 5, 2018) was an American historian in the tradition of literary criticism, perhaps most famous for his work &quot;&quot; (1973/2014).

==Career==
White received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Wayne State University (1951) and his Master of Arts (1952) and Doctor of Philosophy (1955) degrees from the University of Michigan. While an undergraduate at Wayne State, White studied history under William J. Bossenbrook alongside then-classmate Arthur Danto.

In 1998, White directed a seminar (&quot;The Theory of the Text&quot;) at the School of Criticism and Theory.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991. In 2000, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

Among White&#x27;s influences, there were two major figures who taught him &quot;how the historian interprets something.&quot; The first was William J. Bossenbrook, who taught White as an undergraduate at Wayne State University. Bossenbrook saw history as fundamentally a story of the conflict between ideas, values, and dreams. Therefore, Bossenbrook regarded history as a mystery to be constantly pondered and studied rather than a puzzle to be solved. In his last book, &quot;The Practical Past&quot; (2014), White paid tribute to the significant effect of Bossenbrook. The second was 12th-century Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides, particularly his interpretation of the Bible. Maimonides said that since the creation is vast and complex, and God&#x27;s will is beyond human&#x27;s understanding, the goal of biblical interpretation should be to maximize possible interpretations. With this influence, White enjoyed comparing historians&#x27; tasks. The influence of Maimonides helped White focus on a variety of possible interpretations of history, not limited or prescribed history, which diminishes the possibility of interpretation.

== &quot;Metahistory&quot; (1973) ==

In his seminal 1973 book &quot;Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe&quot;, White claimed that the manifest historical text is marked by strategies of explanation, which include explanation by argument, explanation by emplotment, and explanation by ideological implication. He argued that historical writing was influenced by literary writing in many ways, sharing the strong reliance on narrative for meaning. Therefore, White contradicts the view that historical writing can be objective or scientific as purely empiric.

White mentions two figures who have enabled people to ask questions about history&#x27;s objectivity: Marx and Nietzsche. According to White, these thinkers both use their philosophy to consider history which “not only makes us know something about the historical process but know how it knows it.&quot; They focus on the problem of history. Marx regards the problem of history as the problem of the mode of explanation, while, for Nietzsche, the problem is the problem of the mode of emplotment. Thus, history is recorded differently depending on which mode the historian chooses. As a result, ‘a value-free history’ cannot exist. Historiography consists of well-constructed narratives. 

He insists, in particular in chapter 7, that philosophies of history are indispensable elements in historiography, which cannot be separated from historiography. For him, history is not simply a list of chronological events. White also argued, however, that history is most successful when it uses this &quot;narrativity&quot;, since it is what allows history to be meaningful. Emphasizing history as a narrative using language, he argues that true history should contain both characteristics of synchronic and diachronic. This view is contrary to historians such as George Peabody Gooch, and Benedetto Croce, who tried to distinguish between historiography and philosophies of history. He ended his career as University Professor Emeritus at the history of consciousness department of the University of California, Santa Cruz, having previously retired from the comparative literature department of Stanford University.

==Lawsuit against the LAPD==
White figured prominently in a landmark California Supreme Court case regarding covert intelligence gathering on college campuses by police officers in the Los Angeles Police Department. &quot;White v. Davis&quot;, 13 Cal.3d 757, 533 P.2d 222, 120 Cal. Rptr. 94 (1975). During 1972, while a professor of history at UCLA and acting as sole plaintiff, White sued Chief of Police Edward M. Davis, alleging the illegal expenditure of public funds in connection with covert intelligence gathering by police at UCLA. The covert activities included police officers registering as students, taking notes of discussions occurring in classes, and making police reports on these discussions. &quot;White v. Davis&quot;, at 762. The California Supreme Court found for White in a unanimous decision. This case set the standard that determines the limits of legal police surveillance of political activity in California; police cannot engage in such surveillance in the absence of reasonable suspicion of a crime (&quot;Lockyer Manual&quot;).

<text>Scrooge (released as A Christmas Carol in the United States) is a 1951 British Christmas fantasy drama film and an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843). It stars Alastair Sim as Ebenezer Scrooge, and was produced and directed by Brian Desmond Hurst, with a screenplay by Noel Langley. It also features Michael Hordern, Kathleen Harrison, George Cole, Hermione Baddeley, Mervyn Johns, Clifford Mollison, Jack Warner, Ernest Thesiger and Patrick Macnee. Peter Bull narrates portions of Charles Dickens&#x27;s words at the beginning and end of the film, and appears on-screen as a businessman.

Initial reactions to the film were mixed, but subsequent reviews have been more positive, with general praise for the performances, particularly Sim&#x27;s portrayal of Scrooge. 

== Plot ==

On Christmas Eve, Ebenezer Scrooge tells two businessmen that he has no intention of celebrating Christmas. He refuses to donate to two men collecting for the poor. His nephew, Fred, invites him to dinner the next day, but Scrooge refuses, disparaging Fred for having married. Scrooge reluctantly gives his clerk Bob Cratchit Christmas Day off since there will be no business for Scrooge then, but Scrooge expects Cratchit back earlier the following day.

Scrooge returns home and is visited by the ghost of his seven-years-dead partner, Jacob Marley. Marley&#x27;s ghost warns Scrooge that he must change his ways, or after death forever walk the earth bound in chains, as Marley does. Marley says Scrooge will be visited by three spirits, the first to arrive at one o&#x27;clock that night. Frightened, Scrooge takes refuge in his bed.

The Ghost of Christmas Past arrives. Scrooge is shown himself alone at school, unwanted by his father after his mother died in childbirth. His beloved sister Fan arrives to take him home, telling Ebenezer that their father has had a change of heart toward him. The Spirit shows Scrooge the annual Christmas party thrown by his former benevolent employer, S. Fezziwig. Scrooge watches his younger self propose to his sweetheart Alice, who accepts. He is then shown how he is tempted to leave Fezziwig&#x27;s to join a business run by Mr. Jorkin.

Scrooge witnesses the death of Fan after she gives birth to Fred, and discovers he missed her last words asking him to look after her son. Scrooge&#x27;s younger self joins Jorkin and meets Jacob Marley. Jorkin&#x27;s firm buys Fezziwig&#x27;s business, and Alice breaks her engagement to Scrooge because of his dedication to &quot;a golden idol&quot;. When Jorkin is found to have embezzled funds from the now bankrupt company, Scrooge and Marley make good the missing funds, on condition they can control the company. One Christmas Eve, Scrooge refuses to leave work to visit a dying Marley. When Scrooge finally arrives, Marley, knowing he will be punished for his misdeeds, tries to warn Scrooge against his avarice. The Spirit reproaches Scrooge for taking Marley&#x27;s money and house, as an ashamed Scrooge finds himself back in his bed.

Scrooge is then visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present who takes him to see how &quot;men of goodwill&quot; celebrate Christmas. The spirit shows Scrooge poor miners joyfully singing Christmas carols and the Cratchits&#x27; celebration on Christmas Day. Scrooge asks whether their ailing young son, Tiny Tim, will survive his physical disabilities. The Spirit hints that he will not unless the future is changed. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Fred&#x27;s Christmas party, where Fred defends Scrooge from his guests&#x27; critical remarks.

An older Alice is working in a poorhouse, where she ministers to the sick and homeless. The Spirit shows Scrooge two emaciated children, personifying Ignorance and Want. When Scrooge shows concern for their welfare, the Spirit mocks him and scourges the miser with his own words: &quot;Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?&quot;

Finally, Scrooge encounters the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, who shows him the Cratchits mourning Tiny Tim&#x27;s death. Three people, including his charwoman Mrs. Dilber, sell off the possessions of a dead man, and two businessmen joke they will only attend the man&#x27;s funeral if lunch is provided. When shown a gravestone bearing his own name, Scrooge begs the Spirit for a second chance; he then awakens in his bed. 

Scrooge learns that it is Christmas Day, and gleefully realises he still has an opportunity to make amends. Though Mrs. Dilber is initially frightened by his transformation, Scrooge reassures her and promises to raise her salary. He anonymously purchases a prize turkey for the Cratchits and sends it to them. He delights Fred by attending his dinner party, asking his niece-in-law&#x27;s forgiveness and dancing with her. The next day, Scrooge plays a prank on Bob Cratchit and pretends to be about to fire him for lateness, but instead says he will raise Bob&#x27;s salary and assist his family. Scrooge embodies the Christmas spirit and becomes a second father to Tiny Tim, who recovers.

== Production ==
Sim was Hurst&#x27;s first choice to play Scrooge. Teresa Derrington, who played Fred&#x27;s maid who gives Scrooge quiet encouragement to see Fred, said Alastair Sim was not as encouraging to her during filming, and asked her sneeringly if it was her first film role.

===Comparison with the source material===
In the film, Mrs. Dilber is the name of the charwoman, whereas in the book the woman was unnamed and the laundress was named Mrs. Dilber. Dilber’s role is greatly expanded in the film, to the point that her actress receives second billing in the list of cast. The interactions of the two charity benefactors; Scrooge&#x27;s nephew; and his clerk Bob Cratchit in the office are not in the same orders as in the book.

Samuel Wilkins who is in debt to Scrooge was not in the original book. The film also expands on the story by detailing Scrooge&#x27;s rise as a prominent businessman. He was corrupted by an avaricious new mentor, Mr. Jorkin (played by Jack Warner), a character created for the film, who lured him away from the benevolent Mr. Fezziwig and also introduced him to Jacob Marley. When Jorkin is discovered to be an embezzler, the opportunistic Scrooge and Jacob Marley offer to compensate the company&#x27;s losses on the condition that they receive control of the company for which they work – and so, &quot;Scrooge and Marley&quot; is born.

The character of Scrooge&#x27;s fiancée, named Belle in the book, and shown at the end of the Ghost of Christmas Past chapter to have become a happily-married mother of several children, is renamed Alice and is given an extra scene during the Ghost of Christmas Present sequence, where she is not married, and working at a shelter, tending to the needs of the poor. This has led to fan speculation that Scrooge later goes to try find her.

The film rewrites the source material by explaining that Ebenezer&#x27;s mother died giving birth to him, causing his father to resent him. In the book, Fan is much younger than Ebenezer, and the cause of her death is not mentioned. In the film, Ebenezer is younger than Fan, who dies after giving birth to his nephew, Fred, thus engendering Scrooge&#x27;s estrangement from him, and causing him to resent his nephew like his father did before him.

=== Music ===

Richard Addinsell wrote several pieces for the film&#x27;s underscore, ranging from dark and moody to light and joyous. One of the more notable tunes is a polka, used in the two different versions of Fred&#x27;s dinner party: the one Scrooge observes while with the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the other with Scrooge attending the party after atoning for his past coldness to Fred and his wife. The tune is similar to a traditional Slovenian polka called &quot;Stoparjeva&quot; (&quot;hitch-hiker&quot;) or just &quot;Stopar&quot;.

The film also contains excerpts from some traditional Christmas carols and other tunes. &quot;Hark! The Herald Angels Sing&quot; is sung over part of the opening credits, and by the miners when Scrooge is with the Ghost of Christmas Present. An instrumental version of &quot;I Saw Three Ships&quot; is played when Scrooge gives a coin to Mrs. Dilber, and again just before the end of the film. &quot;Silent Night&quot; is played and sung at various times, including over the last part of the final scene and &quot;The End&quot;.

The English country dance &quot;Sir Roger de Coverley&quot; is played and danced during the scene where Scrooge visits the office of Old Fezziwig with The Ghost of Christmas Past.

The tragic folk song &quot;Barbara Allen&quot; is played as an instrumental when young Scrooge is talking with his sister Fan, and sung by a duet at Fred&#x27;s Christmas party. Scrooge turns up in the middle of the line &quot;Young man, I think you&#x27;re dying&quot;, thereby causing the singers to stop before the last two words.

== Release ==
The film was released in Great Britain under its original title, &quot;Scrooge&quot;. United Artists handled the U.S. release under the title &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. The film was originally slated to be shown at New York City&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall as part of their Christmas attraction, but the theatre management decided that the film was too grim and did not possess enough family entertainment value to warrant an engagement at the Music Hall. Instead, the film premiered at the Guild 50th Theatre, near the Music Hall, on 28 November 1951.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on Blu-ray in 2009 by VCI, in a package that also included a DVD copy of the film, cropped into a faux widescreen format. This package only contained minimal bonus features. It was issued again on Blu-ray in 2011 with a remastered transfer, and many bonus features that did not appear in the first Blu-ray edition.

== Reception ==
=== Box-office ===
The film was one of the most popular in Britain in 1952, but was a box office disappointment in the United States.

However, the film became a holiday favourite on American television where it was broadcast regularly during the 1950s and 1960s.

=== Critical reception ===
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; posted a favourable notice, writing that producer Brian Desmond Hurst &quot;has not only hewed to the line of Dickens&#x27; classic fable of a spiritual regeneration on Christmas Eve, but he has got some arresting recreations of the story&#x27;s familiar characters...The visions of Scrooge&#x27;s life story are glimpses into depressing realms, and the aspects of poverty and ignorance in nineteenth-century England are made plain. To the credit of Mr. Hurst&#x27;s production, not to its disfavor, let it be said that it does not conceal Dickens&#x27; intimations of human meanness with an artificial gloss.&quot; Crowther concluded, &quot;...what we have in this rendition of Dickens&#x27; sometimes misunderstood &quot;Carol&quot; is an accurate comprehension of the agony of a shabby soul. And this is presented not only in the tortured aspects of Mr. Sim but in the phantasmagoric creation of a somber and chilly atmosphere. These, set against the exhibition of conventional manifests of love and cheer, do right by the moral of Dickens and round a trenchant and inspiring Christmas show.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was also positive: &quot;This may not be &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; of recent tradition, but I&#x27;ve an idea it&#x27;s the way Dickens would have wanted it. It&#x27;s the way he wrote it.&quot;&quot; Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called the film &quot;delightful entertainment&quot;, finding that &quot;though it does have its somber moments, it ends on so cheerful a note that one cannot help but leave the theatre in a happy mood.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was also mostly positive, writing that &quot;there&#x27;s enough good here to warrant the attendance of all save the hardest of heart.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot;, however, called the film &quot;a grim thing that will give tender-aged kiddies viewing it the screaming-meemies, and adults will find it long, dull and greatly overdone.&quot; It also called Sim&#x27;s performance &quot;a tank-town Hamlet.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a mixed review, criticising the direction while praising the performances. In Britain, &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; was also mixed, finding that the film &quot;as a whole lacks style&quot; and that Sim resembled more a &quot;dour dyspeptic&quot; than a miser, but nevertheless concluded that &quot;the film may please in its good-natured reminder of Christmas joys, and much praise is due to Kathleen Harrison for her inimitable playing of the true Cockney.&quot;

The film gained popularity on TV. Hurst was immensely proud of the film and that it was shown on TV. Patrick Macnee, who played the young Marley, cited the film as his favourite version of the story, stating that it &quot;really seems to capture the true essence of the Dickens novel&quot;. In a 2016 review, Donald Clarke called the film &quot;the best ever committed to film (of the book)&quot;, praising the cast&#x27;s performances. In 1999, &quot;Empire&quot; film critic Monika Maurer gave the film four out of five stars, feeling that while &quot;some of the other performances have dated, Sim&#x27;s haunted Scrooge stands the test of time, even today eliciting sympathy and - you just can&#x27;t help yourself - joy at his transformation&quot;, and concluded, &quot;Lashings of festive cheer and a fair dollop of fine performances will leave you in the mood for mince pies and a renewed sense of seasonal goodwill to all men.&quot; Sim&#x27;s performance still receives praise, with some calling his version of the character the &quot;definitive&quot; Scrooge. Michael Brooke&#x27;s review is not without criticism, finding the various ghosts to be &quot;distinctly unfrightening&quot;, and the Cratchit family &quot;too healthy to be convincingly on the brink of starvation, especially a ruddy-cheeked Tiny Tim who seems barely inconvenienced by his crutches&quot;.

In 2019, Robert Keeling of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised Sim as Scrooge. He said the film captures &quot;the darkness of the story&quot;, but that the film &quot;plays pretty fast and loose with the source material in parts&quot;, noting that the death of Fan has become an artistic error in other adaptations.

<doc id="1173811" wikidata="Q724956" url="?curid=1173811" title="Jens Lekman">
<text>Jens Martin Lekman (; born 6 February 1981) is a Swedish musician. His music is guitar-based pop with heavy use of samples and strings, with lyrics that are often witty, romantic, and melancholic. His work is heavily influenced by Jonathan Richman and Belle &amp; Sebastian, and he has been likened to Stephin Merritt (of The Magnetic Fields), David Byrne, and Scott Walker.

==Early life==
Lekman was born 6 February 1981 in Angered, Gothenburg. As a child, he was not particularly interested in music, but the age of fourteen he was asked to play bass in a friend&#x27;s cover band. This sparked his own songwriting and he quickly came to write hundreds of songs.

Gradually, he adopted the pseudonym Rocky Dennis, a name he borrowed from the protagonist in the movie &quot;Mask&quot;. Under this name, he began releasing limited edition CD-R discs, the first of which was 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Budgie&quot;. In the early 2000s, he sent a collection of the songs to the American record label Secretly Canadian, who contracted him.

==Music career==
From 2000 to 2003, Lekman recorded and released much of his material privately on CD-R. Because one of his songs during this time was titled &quot;Rocky Dennis&#x27; Farewell Song to the Blind Girl&quot;, inspired by the movie &quot;Mask&quot;, Lekman was mistakenly referred to as &quot;Rocky Dennis&quot;. Lekman says that it was a &quot;mistake&quot;: &quot;someone thought that was my real name cause I had a song about him, and then radio picked up on it, and I never had a chance to change it&quot;. He put the confusion to rest with his &quot;Rocky Dennis in Heaven&quot; EP (2004).

In 2003, Lekman self-released a 7&quot; vinyl EP, &quot;Maple Leaves&quot;. When the same EP was released on CD by the Swedish independent label Service Records later that year, he was a well-known name. The songs &quot;Maple Leaves&quot; and &quot;Black Cab&quot; were heavily played on Swedish national radio and the former garnered significant attention through file-sharing platforms. His work has proven to be considerably more successful in Sweden than America. He soon signed a contract with the American label Secretly Canadian for releases outside of Sweden. Heavy touring and his debut album soon followed.

His first album &quot;When I Said I Wanted to Be Your Dog&quot; was released in 2004, and consisted of recordings made between 2000 and 2004 (some tracks had been previously released independently by Lekman). The album attracted attention among the alternative music press in both Europe and the U.S. The song &quot;You Are the Light&quot; was a successful radio hit, and a video received some rotation in the Nordic MTV and ZTV. In Sweden, the album reached No. 6 on the national chart. Lekman was nominated for three Swedish Grammies, three P3 Guld and three Manifest awards, and the album was named the album of the year by Nöjesguiden.

A concert film shot from Lekman&#x27;s sold-out show with José González at Göteborg Concert Hall in December 2003 was broadcast by Swedish national television in 2005. In June 2005, a compilation CD of Lekman&#x27;s first three EPs (plus extra tracks) was released as &quot;Oh You&#x27;re So Silent Jens&quot;. Lekman&#x27;s cover of Scout Niblett&#x27;s &quot;Your Beat Kicks Back Like Death&quot; appeared on Secretly Canadian&#x27;s &quot;SC100&quot; compilation. &quot;Night Falls Over Kortedala&quot; was released in Sweden on 5 September 2007 and worldwide on 9 October 2007. The single &quot;Friday Night at the Drive-in Bingo&quot; preceded the album&#x27;s release.

Live performances by Lekman have differed in style; at times he has performed alone with only a guitar and a CD player, sometimes doing a cappella versions of his songs, while at other times he has been accompanied by a choir and string quartet. In 2008, he toured with an all-female back-up band (dressed mostly in white) that provided basic rock instrumentation as well as horns and backing vocals. In December 2008 Jens played a short China tour organised by Split Works. In 2010, Lekman released a free song entitled &quot;The End of the World is Bigger Than Love&quot; online. This was his first release in three years.

On 19 March 2011, Lekman played a show in support of libraries during the widespread closures in the United Kingdom where he premiered a new song, &quot;Every Little Hair Knows Your Name&quot;.

Lekman&#x27;s &quot;An Argument With Myself&quot; EP was released in September 2011 to generally favorable reviews. This was followed up by &quot;I Know What Love Isn&#x27;t&quot; in September 2012, Lekman&#x27;s first full-length album since 2007, also receiving favorable reviews.

On 2 September 2014, Lekman released a 33-minute-long mixtape titled &quot;WWJD&quot;, which included three unreleased songs: &quot;WWJD&quot;, &quot;I Remember&quot;, and &quot;What&#x27;s That Perfume That You Wear?&quot; The mixtape has been described as being &quot;one cohesive experience as intimate as writing a postcard, as pleasant as receiving one.&quot;

All through 2015, Jens Lekman released a new song every week on his website for free. They are all titled &quot;Postcard&quot; with the number of the week, making 52 tracks in total. In parallel, he led a musical experiment called &quot;Ghostwriting&quot; where he translates into songs stories submitted to him by the public. The first installment was held in Stockholm and yield 5 tracks in Swedish. The second installment was held in Cincinnati and 11 English tracks came out of it. They bring the total of his 2015 output to 68 tracks and they can all be downloaded on his website.

Lekman&#x27;s 4th proper LP, &quot;Life Will See You Now&quot;, was released on 17 February 2017, on the Secretly Canadian label.

On 21 March 2022, Lekman&#x27;s most popular and successful album, &quot;Night Falls Over Kortedala&quot;, was removed from all streaming services and made unavailable to purchase. This move was met with shock by fans, with whom the album is very popular. Lekman cited legal issues as the main reason due to sampling issues.

On 27 April 2022, Lekman announced the reissue of two of his albums that had previously been made unavailable: &quot;Oh You&#x27;re So Silent Jens&quot; and &quot;Night Falls Over Kortedala&quot;. They were reissued respectively as &quot;The Cherry Trees Are Still in Blossom&quot; and &quot;The Linden Trees Are Still in Blossom&quot;. The reissued versions of the albums are composed of re-recordings of all the original tracks, as well as entirely new tracks. &quot;The Cherry Trees Are Still in Blossom&quot; was released digitally on 27 April 2022, whereas &quot;The Linden Trees Are Still in Blossom&quot; was digitally released on 4 May 2022. Both albums were released physically on 3 June 2022 via record label Secretly Canadian.

== Artistry ==
Stephen Metcalf noted that Lekman differs from his influences, among them Morrissey and Stephin Merritt, by fashioning a coyness in his songs about sex – a demeanor that is euphemistic or &quot;even aseptically unsexual&quot; – although he similarly writes of passion and longing. He has often made use of samples, comparable to that of the Avalanches, who he admits to have &quot;rip[ped] off&quot;.

<doc id="1173814" wikidata="Q2432442" url="?curid=1173814" title="Florida State Road 50">
<text>State Road 50 (SR 50) runs across the center of the U.S. state of Florida through Orlando, with its termini at SR 55 (US 19) at Weeki Wachee and SR 5 (U.S. Route 1) in Titusville.

SR 50 is signed east–west. Within various counties throughout the state, the highway is signed with various names such as Cortez Boulevard in Hernando County and Colonial Drive in Orange County. The former section includes the concurrency with US 98 between Brooksville and near Ridge Manor. US 98-SR 50 is the only interchange with Interstate 75 in Hernando County.

Several portions of SR 50 east of SR 436 follow the original Cheney Highway, which was named for John Moses Cheney and was the first road to the coast from Orlando. Full travel from Orlando to Titusville on the Old Cheney Highway, however, is not possible due to the demolition of a bridge over the Econlockhatchee River. At the eastern terminus of SR 50, NASA&#x27;s Vehicle Assembly Building is visible.

State Road 408, also known as the East-West Expressway or Toll Road 408, from its western starting point near Ocoee to its eastern terminus near the University of Central Florida near Bithlo, runs almost directly parallel to SR 50, with most exits on the 408 being within a mile to 2 miles away from SR 50. The East-West Expressway was originally designed to, and still does, relieve traffic congestion on SR 50 during rush hour.

==Route description==

===Hernando and Sumter counties===
State Road 50 begins at US 19 and County Road 550 in the former City of Weeki Wachee. The first intersection around the east side of the city limits is with Deltona Boulevard(CR 589), which can be found on the opposite side of the West Hernando County Public Library. From here the road is mostly lined with residential properties to the south and sparse commercial offices ranging from a Hernando County Firehouse, to an office for the Withlacoochee River Electric Cooperative, to random medical offices. East of Nightwalker Road and July Avenue, SR 50 enters land owned by the Southwest Florida Water Management District, and the right-of-way for a set of power lines. From there, the road becomes the official northern border between Spring Hill and unincorporated Brooksville as it approaches the Sand Hill Scout Reservation. Immediately after the entrance to the aforementioned Boy Scout Camp, the road intersects Oak Hill Hospital on the opposite side. Shortly after the hospital, SR 50 climbs a hill and intersects with the gateway to High Point.

From this point on, SR 50 is a symbol of the suburban sprawl that defines Hernando County. It also contains a series of disconnected frontage roads similar to those on US 19. Though most of the stores along these frontage roads consist of mini-malls, medical offices, and the occasional automotive repair shop, three major shopping centers can be found at the intersection with Mariner Boulevard, which is designated as CR 587 south of SR 50. East of those three major shopping centers is a Wal-Mart Supercenter and a Sam&#x27;s Club Warehouse on the same side of the street. The Sam&#x27;s Club is just west of the intersection of Sunshine Grove Road(CR 493) and Twin Dolphin Road, where SR 50 crosses the right-of-way for another set of power lines. While SR 50 climbs a hill and then descends, Twin Dolphin runs parallel to the eastbound lane as it climbs its own hill but then terminates at the same eastbound lane before SR 50 intersects CR 585(Barclay Avenue) and the entrance to Brookridge. From here the road runs along the southern edge of Brookridge until it intersects Oak Avenue, just before it passes under a pedestrian/bicycle bridge west of the interchange Suncoast Parkway, and instantly intersects CR 570(Wiscon Road), where the road curves to the northeast. Curving back to direct east, SR 50 intersects another former section at CR 484 and then serves as the northern terminus for CR 583(California Street). The right-of-way for the frontage road on the south side terminates in just east of Colorady Street, then the road descends towards Lykes Dublin Road and passes by Brooksville Regional Hospital, which moved out of the City of Brooksville in the first decade of the 21st century. The road then curves northeast towards the City of Brooksville. A right-of way for another frontage road was built on the north side of SR 50 in front of the hospital, and was assumed to be for nurses quarters for the hospital. This roadway was intended to stretch as far east as Mobley Road. Neither the road nor the nurses quarters have been built as of this writing.

At the southern end of CR 485 and the west end of State Road 50A, SR 50 takes a sharp right turn and joins US Truck Route 98 around downtown Brooksville, but never truly leaves the city limits. Curving to the southeast near the Hernando County Sheriff&#x27;s Department headquarters, the remainder of the former rural characteristics of Brooksville can still be found, until it approaches US 41 where hidden State Road 700 secretly joins the road. Climbing another hill, the road turns direct east again where it passes in front of a pair of churches before the intersection of County Road 445(Main Street) and Mitchell Road, and then an at-grade crossing with CSX&#x27;s Brooksville Subdivision. After the intersection with CR 581, the road turns northeast as it approaches the intersection of Jasmine Boulevard, but more importantly US 98 and the eastern terminus of SR 50A, as well as the eastern terminus of US Truck Route 98. From here the speed limit increases to 60 miles per hour. It moves primarily southeast through farmland and wooded swampland. US 98/SR 50 finally turns straight east again when it runs between a pair of lakebeds before the intersection with CRs 484 and 541. At this point, the road moves up and down a series of hills but first passes by communities such as Rolling Acres and Hill &#x27;n Dale, where a residential frontage road can be found on the north side. The hills continue along the road, but along more farms and sparsely populated areas, among them Wildlife Lane. One trailer park can be found just west of Lockhart Road, which is the site of numerous dog shows. Entering the unincorporated community of Ridge Manor West, the road approaches some hotels, gas stations and restaurants serving motorist and tourists on Interstate 75. US 98-SR 50 is the only interchange along I-75 in Hernando County, and until the completion of the reconstruction of the interchange in September 2019, the left-turn lanes leading to the on-ramps were notoriously short. Directly east of I-75 is a development that shares the community&#x27;s namesake as well as one shopping center.
The road takes one last drop, only to rise again and officially enter Ridge Manor at the intersection of Kettering Road and Croom-Rital Road which leads to a trailhead for the Withlacoochee State Trail US 98-SR 50 pass under a bridge for this trail. At the crossing over the Withlacoochee River, two former sections of the road exist on the east side of the river; Paul N. Steckle Lane, and Ridge Manor Boulevard. The shorter Paul N. Steckle Lane exists on the north side and contains a Hernando County Firehouse, local residences, and one entrance to the Cypress Lake Preserve. Ridge Manor Boulevard begins on the south side, and crosses over to the north side east of the firehouse and west of the Hernando County Eastside Solid Waste Convenience Station. When US 98 turns southeast toward Trilby, Dade City, and West Palm Beach, SR 50 continues east and narrows down to two lanes. The final major intersection in Hernando County is with US 301. After this, the road passes by a sand mine, and the right-of way for an abandoned segment of Ridge Manor Boulevard, before it crosses the CSX&#x27;s Wildwood Subdivision (part of the S-Line), and then serves as the northern terminus of CR 575 which becomes a State Road once it enters Pasco County. SR 50 turns northeast and enters Withlacoochee State Forest. Within the forest, the road crosses the Little Withlacoochee River, a tributary of the Withlacoochee River, where it crosses the Hernando-Sumter County Line.
As SR 50 enters Sumter County, it continues to move further north, however at the intersection of CR 478A, it turns back east before it enters Tarrytown and eventually intersects State Road 471 where one can find a clear view of a lumber mill. East of here, SR 50 runs along the north side of the former Orange Belt Railway right-of-way. Both SR 50 and the railroad bed pass through the rural unincorporated communities of Linden and then Mabel, which serves as the northern terminus for the General James A. Van Fleet State Trail. Access to the trail is available from both Sumter County Road 773 northwest of the trailhead as well as Southeast 121st Avenue northeast of the trailhead. The last intersection in Sumter County is CR 469, which takes motorists to Center Hill. SR 50 crosses the Sumter-Lake County Line in the vicinity of a series of power lines.

===Lake County and western Orange County===
Upon entering Lake County, SR 50 maintains its rural surroundings as it runs through unincorporated communities such as Sloans Ridge, but even after running through Stuckey those characteristics diminish as the road moves further east. Within the City of Mascotte, the name of SR 50 changes to West Myers Boulevard. After the former Orange Belt Railway right-of-way crosses the road, a multiplex with State Road 33 begins at CR 33(Bluff Lake Road), where SR 50 suddenly becomes a four-lane divided highway named East Myers Boulevard. After the intersection with Atlantic Avenue, SR 33-50 also acquires the name Broad Street. These two names are shared until the road enters the city limits of Groveland, and Myers Boulevard terminates. The divider is widened further at a BP gas station in a former fork in the road when SR 50 becomes a pair of one-way streets in Downtown Groveland. Eastbound SR 33-50 becomes Orange Street, while westbound SR 33-50 remains Broad Street. After passing by Lake David the road intersects State Road 19. The two streets that carry two directions of SR 50 merge again at the east end of the multiplex with State Road 33. Broad Street continues to take SR 50 further east as a four-lane divided highway. Roughly two blocks east of CR 565A, the road crosses into the City of Clermont, where it passes two developments before dipping down slightly and to the southeast to run over the Palatlakaha River between Lakes Hiawatha and Palatlakaha, the latter of which has a trailer park on the eastbound line. Motorists can see the Florida Citrus Tower well before the intersection with CR 561(12th Street), where the tower itself can be found on the north side. Three intersections later at West Avenue the road turns directly east again in front of Center Lake to the north side and two blocks north of Lake Winona on the south side. After passing by Crystal Lake to the north SR 50 runs along the north edge of Lake Sunnyside, where it then runs southeast before reaching an unnumbered interchange with US 27.
As the road crosses the Lake-Orange County Line, it instantly enters the census-designated place of Killarney. Here, SR 50 is officially named &quot;West Colonial Drive.&quot; On both sides of the border are connecting roads to Old State Road 50, as well as trailheads for the Lake Minneola Scenic Trail and West Orange Trail. The road&#x27;s time in Killarney is short-lived though as it enters Oakland where it curves briefly to the northeast to encounter Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, and the recently rebuilt Exit 272. The road evolves into a total commercial strip in Winter Garden, and serves as the terminus of County Road 545 north of Tildenville. It also intersects such roads as County Road 535 as well as State Road 537. The one and only interchange in Winter Garden is with State Road 429&#x27;s (Western Expressway&#x27;s) Exit 23, but immediately after this interchange SR 50 enters Ocoee where it intersects with Exit 267B on Florida&#x27;s Turnpike, at another connector ramp without a crossing. The next major intersection in Ocoee is State Road 439 (Bluford Avenue) in Minorville, which also doubles as the western terminus of State Road 526 and leads to Old Winter Garden Road. Right after the intersection of Blackwood Avenue and the grounds of the Health Central Hospital, the road intersects both Clarke Road and the connecting ramps to and from State Road 408, which is considered Exit 1. Past this, the road heads south of the West Oaks Mall. The final segment in Ocoee runs along more strip malls and cluster developments, then runs along a causeway over Lake Lotta before it enters Orlando proper. The first intersection in Orlando is Good Homes Road, but then SR 50 goes over another causeway over Lake Sherwood. After this, the road intersects the still incomplete County Road 435(Apopka-Vineland Road). Currently CR 435 is detoured at Hiawassee Road. Other major intersections in western Orlando include the northern terminus of State Road 435 (Kirkman Road). Briefly, SR 50 runs through Orlando Chinatown and then resumes the previous commercial strip. Important intersections include State Road 423 (John Young Parkway). East of that intersection as SR 50 meets North Tampa Avenue the road narrows down to four lanes.

===Downtown Orlando and vicinity===
US 17-US 92-US 441 (Orange Blossom Trail) serves as the western end of the U.S. Route 17/92 (SR 500/SR 600) concurrency. Here, US 17-92 (and SR 600) end their concurrency with US 441, and join SR 50, while US 441 and the Orange Blossom Trail move further northwest in Florida and beyond. A railroad line runs along the right side of this intersection, and the first feature along the US 17/92-SR 50 multiplex is a grade crossing. US 17/92 with SR 50 (and SR 600), meets the south end of Edgewater Drive and passes by Lake Dot Park and then Don Dudley Park before it crosses Interstate 4 (SR 400; Exits 83B &amp; 84) then crosses the SunRail tracks (former CSX A-Line) and State Road 527 (Orange Avenue southbound and Magnolia Avenue northbound) before meeting State Road 15(Mills Avenue), where US 17/92 turns north thereby marking the eastern end of US 17/92(SR 600) concurrency. Between Maguire Boulevard and Lake Barton, SR 50 runs along the northern border of Orlando Executive Airport, however the view of the airport is obstructed by numerous stores and shopping malls. Along this stretch, the road passes north of Colonial Plaza and south of Orlando Fashion Square. Across from Lake Barton is the western terminus of Old Cheney Highway, a former section of SR 50. East of this intersection is Little Lake Barton, and SR 50 begins to curve to the northeast, but not as sharply as the former segment. Lake Barton stretches from the vicinity of this intersection to the southwest corner of State Road 436 (Semoran Boulevard), which has had an interchange since 2010. The road continues its northeast curve into Azalea Park as it passes by the nearby Colonial High School named in honor of SR 50, it then intersects Old Cheney Highway a second time but then moves directly east again before the intersection with State Road 551(Goldenrod Road)

===East of Orlando and the Space Coast===
Though leaving Orlando, SR 50 remains in Orange County as it enters Union Park, Here the road has one interchange with State Road 417(Central Florida GreeneWay) at Exit 34, but signs also point towards State Toll Road 408. Entering University Park, SR 50 intersects such major highways as State Road 434 (Alafaya Trail), and then the eastern terminus of State Road 408 at Exit 23, which is also the southern terminus of the Challenger Parkway at the University of Central Florida. After crossing a bridge over the Econlockhatchee River, the road curves to the southeast and passes through Lockwood and then Bithlo which is near the Orange County Raceway complex, which includes the Orlando Speed World Dragstrip and the Orange Speed World Speedway. Further east within Bithlo, SR 50 serves as the western terminus of State Road 520 at an interchange with no exit numbers. East of this interchange the road turns direct east again and passes through Christmas, a rural community containing various Christmas shops, trailer parks and the Jungle Adventures Nature Animal Park which boasts of having &quot;Swampy&quot; the world&#x27;s largest alligator.
Before crossing the St. Johns River, SR 50 runs along the northern border of the Tosohatchee State Reserve. The westbound bridge over the river was built in 1967, while the eastbound bridge was built in 1971. After crossing the third bridge along the river, it enters Brevard County and the name changes from East Colonial Drive to Cheney Highway. From here it runs along the southern border of the Saint Johns National Wildlife Refuge, which terminates at the interchange with Interstate 95 at Exit 215. SR 50 officially enters Titusville after passing by the entrance to The Great Outdoors Golf and Recreational Vehicle Resort, west of the I-95 interchange. Immediately the road is lined with hotels gas stations and restaurants as it curves to the northeast to intersect State Road 405, which serves as a half-loop around Titusville to Kennedy Space Center. From here the road curves east again, and stays straight throughout most of the rest of the segment, with the exception of an area known as The Meadows between Hood Avenue and Moon Road. After the Florida East Coast Railroad crossing, NASA&#x27;s Vehicle Assembly Building is visible just before the east end of SR 50 at US Route 1.

==History==

Before the 1945 renumbering, the route that became SR 50 had the following numbers:
* SR 15 from Weeki Wachee to Brooksville
* SR 34 from Brooksville to Rolling Acres
* SR 51 from Brooksville to Tildenville
* SR 210 from east of Ridge Manor to east of Mabel
* SR 22 from east of Mabel to Tildenville
* SR 2 from Mascotte to Groveland
* SR 208 from Tildenville south 1/4 mile
* SR 434 from south of Tildenville to Minorville
* SR 22 from Minorville to Indian River City
* SR 51 from Minorville to Orlando
* SR 322 from near Gotha to Orlando

SR 50 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as:
* From Weekiwachee Springs on SR 55 Northeasterly via Wiscon and Spring Hill to a junction with SR 45 in Brooksville and East along SR 45 to intersection with Main St. then South on Main St. to a point near the South City Limits of Brooksville. Then East and Southeasterly via Rital to Richloam thence Northeasterly via Riverland - Tarrytown and Mable[sic] to a junction with SR 33 in Mascotte and along SR 33 to intersection with SR 459 at Groveland. Thence in an Easterly direction via Minneola - Oakland - Minorville and Orlovista[sic] to a junction with SR 500 in Orlando and North along SR 500 to Colonial Drive then East along Colonial Drive and Easterly via Bithlo - Ft. Christmas to junction with SR 5 at Indian River City in Brevard County.
* Also from intersection of SR 50 and Massachusetts St. in Mascotte North along Massachusetts St. to intersection with SR 33.

Since then, the following changes have been made:
* SR 50 was extended west from its west end to Bayport, on the Gulf of Mexico. Later it was given back to Hernando County (now CR 550).
* A new alignment for SR 50 was built east of Brooksville, removing the section on Main Street (which may have become SR 581) and a part east of Main Street.
* Later, SR 50 was realigned around Brooksville, and the old road through downtown became SR 50A.
* Near the Withlacoochee River a higher four-lane bridge was built on a short realigned section. The old road, which only exists on the east side of the river is now called Paul N. Steckle Lane, and can be found behind a Hernando County Firehouse.
* Three dirt roads inside Withlacoochee State Forest were once part of SR 50. They include Richloam-Clay Sink Road, Riverland Road, and Ham Road.
* The spur in Mascotte is no longer state-maintained.
* A whole new alignment was built from east of Groveland to south of Tildenville, via Clermont. The old road became, in order from west to east, SR 565A (now CR 565A), SR 561A (now CR 561), SR 561 (now partly abandoned and partly maintained by Clermont), an unknown number (now CR Old 50), and SR 438 (now CR 438). The short north–south connector at Tildenville became an extension of SR 545 (now CR 545).
* A whole new alignment was built from Minorville to west of downtown Orlando. The old road became an extension of SR 526 (now CR 526), and the concurrency with SR 500/SR 600 was removed.
* Several minor realignments were built in 1948 (at least the eastern two) at SR 436 and west of and at Bithlo. The old roads are now Old Cheney Highway.
*In Mabel, a railroad bridge that went over the right-of-way for a former railroad line once used by Seaboard Air Line Railroad spanning from Coleman to Auburndale in Polk County until the 1980s. This bridge was removed by the Florida Department of Transportation in the early-2010s.
*State Road 50 from U.S. 27 in Clermont through the turnpike to Pine Hills Road was widened from four lanes to six-lanes, a divided highway with improvements to the on and off ramps of the Florida Turnpike. The construction project for six-laning from SR 436 to Dean Road has been completed, and next phase from Dean Road to Avalon Park Boulevard was started in early 2014. Improvements include the new overpass at the State Road 436 Semoran Boulevard intersection which has access ramps to Semoran Boulevard either southbound to the Orlando International Airport or northbound. This overpass was completed in 2010.

==Plans==
State Road 50 is being widened from a two-lane undivided highway to a four-lane divided highway from U.S. 301 in Ridge Manor to east of Sumter County Road 478A near Tarrytown.

==Major intersections==























==Related routes==

===State Road 50A===

State Road 50A (SR 50A) is a former segment of SR 50 that runs primarily along West and East Jefferson Street, entirely in the city of Brooksville in the State of Florida. Like its parent route, it is signed east–west.

The road begins at the intersection of SR 50 (Cortez Boulevard, including the realigned section) and CR 485 (Cobb Road). The realigned section of SR 50 serves as Truck Route 50 as well as part of Truck US 98, while CR 485 also serves as Truck US 98. At Ponce de Leon Boulevard (US 98/SR 700), it becomes concurrent with US 98, until its eastern terminus with SR 50 and Jasmine Drive. Shortly after this new concurrence, it makes a right along North Mildred Avenue, for eastbound traffic only, and both merge with US 41. Between North Mildred Avenue and May Avenue, eastbound SR 50A, US 41, and US 98 are concurrent along Broad Street, while westbound SR 50A, US 41, and US 98 are concurrent along East Jefferson Avenue, then West Jefferson Avenue. US 41 reunites with Broad Street at North Mildred Avenue. This one-way configuration for Broad Street and Jefferson Street has been in effect since November 1993, according to the Florida Department of Transportation. While both segments go up and down steep hills in the heart of the city, the Broad Street (eastbound) section runs over an old railroad bridge built in 1936.

Turning south along East Jefferson Street near Roger&#x27;s Christmas House, SR 50A &amp; US 98 go down an easier hill where it curves to the left before the intersection with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard (formerly Summit Street/CR 581A), then zips past the northern terminus of CR 581 (Emerson Road), finally reuniting with SR 50, which US 98 becomes concurrent with until breaking away in Ridge Manor more than east.

===County Road 550===
County Road 550 is a former segment and coastal spur of SR 50. It runs from the Gulf of Mexico in Bayport to US 19 in Weeki Wachee, where it becomes SR 50. Like its parent route, it is signed east–west, and is named Cortez Boulevard.

County Road 550 begins at Bayport Park heading east, then later curves to the northeast until it approaches a seafood restaurant on the southwest corner of an intersection with CR 495, only to turn back east again over the tidal swamps of the coast, which are owned by the Chassahowitzka National Wildlife Refuge. Curving southeast, the road passes by a fishing encampment and another restaurant before intersecting with CR 597 north of Weeki Wachee Gardens. From there, a sparse residential area can be found, but after more woods, a semi-commercial area turns up. The road finally curves to the east before approaching preserved land near Weeki Wachee Springs and terminates at the intersection of US 19 and SR 50.

===County Road Old 50===

County Road Old 50 is another former segment of SR 50. Like its parent route, it is signed east–west. Though other county roads were also part of State Road 50, the only portion signed as CR Old 50 is between Minneola and the Lake-Orange County Line. The segment east of CR 455 is part of the Green Mountain Scenic Byway.

<text>The [[Provisional government|interim government]] of the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] (21 September 1981 – 29 October 1981) was established after the assassination of Mohammad-Ali Rajai (President) and Mohammad Javad Bahonar (Prime Minister) on 30 August. In accordance with the constitution, a Provisional Presidential Council formed the same day and proposed Mohammad-Reza Mahdavi Kani as prime minister to the Majlis. Majlis voted in favour of him on 2 September. His cabinet also received approval of the Majlis on 3 September. The main responsibility of this government was holding presidential elections. On 13 October, Ali Khamenei officially became president. His prime minister, Mir-Hossein Mousavi received Majlis&#x27;s approval on 29 October (after Majlis&#x27; negative vote to Khamenei&#x27;s first candidate, Ali Akbar Velayati) and then the new government replaced Mahdavi-Kani&#x27;s interim government.

<doc id="1173821" wikidata="Q1638378" url="?curid=1173821" title="Passa Quatro">
<text>Passa-Quatro is a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The population is 16,393 (2020 est.) in an area of 277.22 km2. It is part of the microregion of São Lourenço.

==History==
The origin of the name comes from the explorations of the bandeirante Fernão Dias Paes Leme who was given instructions to pass over a river four times, thus &quot;Passa Quatro&quot;. The first inhabitants settled the region in 1674. The region wasn&#x27;t populated until the second half of the 19th century when it became a district in 1854. In 1884, the Minas-Rio railway was constructed by the English and spurred its development. Emperor Dom Pedro II elevated the town to a city in 1888.

==Geography==
Mountains include the fourth tallest peak in Brazil, the Pedra da Mina (2,798 m) located within Serra Fina and the point of Serra da Mantiqueira where the boundary of São Paulo is located. The Pico dos Três Estados is another landmark located on the boundaries of São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. There are dozens of other peaks over 2,000 m.

The city was declared a hydro-mineral spa in 1941 due to its various fountains of torio-radioactive waters, which are reputedly sought out for curing liver and kidney problems. The winter is dry and the summer mild with temperatures varying between 16 and 22 degrees Celsius. In winter they can drop to 0 degrees with strong frost. This rural area has views of four of the ten highest peaks in the country. Trout fishing is possible all year. A tourist train service (narrow gauge) was inaugurated in the beginning of 2004 between the cities of Passa Quatro and Manacá.

The municipality contains the Passa Quatro National Forest, created in 1968.
The forest is controlled by IBAMA and has native forest, exotic species, lakes, and the Iporã waterfall.

===New Climber Point===
Passa Quatro has a newer point of climber at Brazil, compared to Siurana: Gruta de Passa Quatro (Cave of Four Passes).
There are a big negative and the local climbers are working to open the roads in this place. (The climbing point is in Passa Vinte, not in Passa Quarto)

<doc id="1173823" wikidata="Q1153484" url="?curid=1173823" title="Folk art">
<text>Folk art covers all forms of visual art made in the context of folk culture. Definitions vary, but generally the objects have practical utility of some kind, rather than being exclusively decorative. The makers of folk art are typically trained within a popular tradition, rather than in the fine art tradition of the culture. There is often overlap, or contested ground with &#x27;naive art&#x27;. &quot;Folk art&quot; is not used in regard to traditional societies where ethnographic art continue to be made.

The types of objects covered by the term &quot;folk art&quot; vary. The art form is categorised as &quot;divergent... of cultural production ... comprehended by its usage in Europe, where the term originated, and in the United States, where it developed for the most part along very different lines.&quot; From a European perspective, Edward Lucie-Smith described it as &quot;Unsophisticated art, both fine and applied, which is supposedly rooted in the collective awareness of simple people. The concept of folk art is a distinctly 19th-century one. Today it carries with it a tinge of nostalgia for pre-industrial society.&quot;

Folk arts, which include both performance and tangible arts, reflect the cultural life of a community associated with the fields of folklore and cultural heritage. Tangible folk art can include objects which historically are crafted and used within a traditional community. Intangible folk arts can include such forms as music and art galleries, dance and narrative structures.

== Characteristics of folk art objects ==

Objects of folk art are a subset of material culture and include objects which are experienced through the senses, by seeing and touching. Typical for material culture in art, these tangible objects can be handled, repeatedly re-experienced, and sometimes broken. They are considered works of art because of the technical execution of an existing form and design; the skill might be seen in the precision of the form, the surface decoration or in the beauty of the finished product. As a folk art, these objects share several characteristics that distinguish them from other artifacts of material culture.

=== Folk artists ===
The object is created by a The craft-person works within an established cultural framework. The folk art has a recognizable style and method in crafting its pieces, which allows products to be recognized and attributed to a single individual or workshop. This was originally articulated by Alois Riegl in his study of &quot;Volkskunst, Hausfleiss, und Hausindustrie&quot;, published in 1894. &quot;Riegl ... stressed that the individual hand and intentions of the artist were significant, even in folk creativity. To be sure, the artist may have been obliged by group expectations to work within the norms of transmitted forms and conventions, but individual creativity – which implied personal aesthetic choices and technical virtuosity – saved received or inherited traditions from stagnating and permitted them to be renewed in each generation.&quot; Individual innovation in the production process plays an important role in the continuance of these traditional forms. Many folk art traditions like quilting, ornamental picture framing, and decoy carving continue to be practiced, and new forms continue to emerge.

Contemporary outsider artists are often self-taught, and their work is usually developed in isolation or in small communities across the country. The Smithsonian American Art Museum houses over 70 folk and self-taught artists.

=== Hand crafted ===

Folk art objects are usually produced in a one-off production process. Only one object is made at a time, either by hand or in a combination of hand and machine methods, and are not mass-produced. As a result of manual production, individual pieces are considered to be unique and usually can be differentiated from other objects of the same type. In his essay on &quot;Folk Objects&quot;, folklorist Simon Bronner references preindustrial modes of production, but folk art objects continue to be made as unique crafted pieces by folk artisans. &quot;The notion of folk objects tends to emphasize the handmade over machine manufactured. Folk objects imply a mode of production common to preindustrial communal society where knowledge and skills were personal and traditional.&quot; Folk art does not need to be old; it continues to be hand-crafted today in many regions around the world.

=== Workshops and apprentices ===
The design and production of folk art is Folk art does not aim for individualistic expression. Instead, &quot;the concept of group art implies, indeed requires, that artists acquire their abilities, both manual and intellectual, at least in part from communication with others. The community has something, usually a great deal, to say about what passes for acceptable folk art.&quot; Historically, the training in a handicraft was done as apprenticeships with local craftsmen, such as the blacksmith or the stonemason. As the equipment and tools needed were no longer readily available in the community, these traditional crafts moved into technical schools or applied arts schools.

Teaching of the craft through informal means outside of institutions has opened the genre to artists who may face barrier to entry in other disciplines. Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis, for example, suffered from an undiagnosed congenital illness, making formal art schooling a challenge. Despite barriers to formal education, Lewis became one of Canada&#x27;s most famous folk artists, creating thousands of paintings of life in Nova Scotia. 

=== Owned by the community ===
The object is Similar objects can be found in the environment made by other individuals which resemble this object. Individual pieces of folk art will reference other works in the culture, even as they show exceptional individual execution in form or design. If antecedents cannot be found for this object, it might still be a piece of art but it is not folk art. &quot;While traditional society does not erase ego, it does focus and direct the choices that an individual can acceptably make… the well-socialized person will find the limits are not inhibiting but helpful… Where traditions are healthy the works of different artists are more similar than they are different; they are more uniform than personal.&quot; Tradition in folk art emerges through the passing of information from one generation to another. Through generations of family lines, family members pass down the knowledge, information, skills and tools needed to continue the creation of one&#x27;s folk art. Examples are Leon &quot;Peck&quot; Clark, a Mississippi basket maker, who learned his skills from a community member; George Lopez of Cordova, New Mexico, who is a sixth-generation santos carver whose children also carve; and the Yorok-Karok basket weavers, who explain that relatives generally taught them to weave.” 

=== Utility of the object ===
The known type of the object it was created to serve some function in the daily life of the household or the community. This is the reason the design continues to be made. Since the form itself had function and purpose, it was duplicated over time in various locations by different individuals. A book on the history of art states that &quot;every man-made thing arises from a problem as a purposeful solution.&quot; Written by George Kubler and published in 1962, &quot;The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things&quot; describes an approach to historical change which places the history of objects and images in a larger continuum of time. The purpose of folk art is not purely decorative or aimed to have duplicated handicraft. However, since the form itself was a distinct type with its function and purpose, folk art has continued to be copied over time by different individuals.

=== Aesthetics of the genre ===
The object is recognized as being Being part of the community, the craftsperson is reflecting on the community&#x27;s cultural aesthetics, and may take into consideration the community&#x27;s response to the handicraft. An object can be created to match the community&#x27;s expectations, and the artist may design the product with unspoken cultural biases to reflect this aim. While the shared form indicates a shared culture, innovation can enable the individual artisan to embody their own vision. This can be a representation of manipulating collective and individual culture, within the traditional folk art production. &quot;For art to progress, its unity must be dismantled so that certain of its aspects can be freed for exploration, while others shrink from attention.&quot; This dichotomous representation of the culture is typically visible in the final product.

== Materials, forms, and crafts ==
Folk art is designed in different shapes, sizes and forms. It traditionally uses the materials which are at hand in the locality and reproduces familiar shapes and forms. The Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage has compiled a page of storied objects that have been part of one of their annual folklife festivals. The list below includes a sampling of different materials, forms, and artisans involved in the production of everyday and folk art objects.

== Related terminology ==
Listed below are a wide-ranging assortment of labels for an eclectic group of art works. All of these genres are created outside of the institutional structures of the art world, and are not considered &quot;fine art&quot;. There is overlap between these labeled collections, such that an object might be listed under two or more labels. Many of these groupings and individual objects might also resemble &quot;folk art&quot; in its aspects, however may not align to the defining characteristics outlined above. 
==Influence on mainstream art==
Folk artworks, styles and motifs have inspired various artists. For example, Pablo Picasso was inspired by African tribal sculptures and masks. Natalia Goncharova and others were inspired by traditional Russian popular prints called luboks.

In 1951, artist, writer and curator Barbara Jones organised the exhibition &quot;Black Eyes and Lemonade&quot; at the Whitechapel Gallery in London as part of the Festival of Britain. This exhibition, along with her publication &quot;The Unsophisticated Arts&quot;, exhibited folk and mass-produced consumer objects alongside contemporary art in an early instance of the popularisation of pop art in Britain.

== Supporting organizations ==
The United Nations recognizes and supports cultural heritage around the world, in particular UNESCO in partnership with the International Organization of Folk Art (IOV). Their declared mission is to &quot;further folk art, customs and culture around the world through the organization of festivals and other cultural events, … with emphasis on dancing, folk music, folk songs and folk art.&quot; By supporting international exchanges of folk art groups as well as the organization of festivals and other cultural events, their goal is promote international understanding and world peace.

In the United States, the National Endowment for the Arts works to promote greater understanding and sustainability of cultural heritage across the United States and around the world through research, education, and community engagement. As part of this, they identify and support NEA folk art fellows in quilting, ironwork, woodcarving, pottery, embroidery, basketry, weaving, along with other related traditional arts. The NEA guidelines define as criteria for this award a display of &quot;authenticity, excellence, and significance within a particular tradition&quot; for the artists selected. (NEA guidelines) .”
In 1966, the NEA&#x27;s first year of funding, support for national and regional folk festivals was identified as a priority with the first grant made in 1967 to the National Folk Festival Association. Folklife festivals are celebrated around the world to encourage and support the education and community engagement of diverse ethnic communities.

<text>Chołodecki (variously spelled as Cholodecki, Hołodecki, Holodecki) is the Polish surname of one of the noble (&quot;szlachta&quot;) families.
It is derived from the village of Chołodec located in Wołyń, currently located in Ukraine.

According to historian Józef Białynia Chołodecki, an unknown member of the Białynia clan was given the rights to develop the land in and around Chołodec, and that individual took the last name of Chołodecki.

The Chołodecki surname first appears in the 17th century in Poland.
A Chołodecki is listed in the registers during the election of King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki in 1669. In the late 17th century Kazimierz Amor Chołodecki becomes a man of some stature in Włodzimierz Wołyński, living on the estate of Piatydnia.

The family was confirmed as Szlachta in 1783 and 1825 by the Austrian authorities in Galicia.
In Wołyń, nobility under the stricter Russian rules was confirmed in 1811 and 1827.

==Patriotic traditions==
The Białynia clan, to which the Chołodecki family belongs, was granted its coat of arms for bravery in battle under King Łokietek.
The Chołodeckis continued their clan&#x27;s tradition.

In 1675, Chołodeckis took part in the famous Defense of Trembowla under Jan Samuel Chrzanowski.
In that battle, a small group of soldiers managed to defend the town against a Turkish army.
The family had significant members involved in the November Uprising (Tomasz Chołodecki, Ferdinand Chołodecki, Celestyn Chołodecki) of 1830.
Chołodeckis played a significant role in the planning and execution of the failed Kraków Uprising of 1846.
Tomasz Chołodecki was initially sentenced to death for his part, but the sentence was later reduced.
Chołodeckis also took part in the battles of the January Uprising of 1863 (Tomasz Chołodecki, Ferdinand Chołodecki, Celestyn Chołodecki, Józef Białynia Chołodecki).

Due to the families&#x27; continued involvement in major upheavals in Poland&#x27;s fight for independence during the 19th century, the family living in Wołyń had all of its land and belongings confiscated.
The major confiscations occurred after the Kraków Uprising and the January Uprising.
Some members, such as Aleksander Chołodecki, fleeing to France.
The small but more prominent section of the family located in Galicia was left with mostly leasehold estates.

Chołodecki involvement in the fight for Poland&#x27;s independence also extended into World War I, the Polish-Ukrainian War (Józef Białynia Chołodecki), and World War II.
Witold Chołodecki, for example, was murdered by Soviet forces in Charków in 1940.
During the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia in 1943 Antoni and Wiktoria Cholodecki were murdered by UPA forces, while the largest segment managed to flee west and eventually settled around the city of Wrocław. A smaller group of Chołodeckis from Huta Stara took part in the defense of the town. Huta Stara, while consisting of around 100 homes, became a regional sanctuary for 10,000 Poles who flocked to the town seeking shelter and safety from UPA attacks. A decisive battle waged on October 16, 1943, defeated the UPA and allowed the family to stay in the town until the summer of 1945, when they were forcibly repatriated to areas around Kołobrzeg. The remaining family located in Lwów settled in Poznań.
Chołodeckis also fought for an end to communism in Poland.
Jarosław Chołodecki was the vice-chair for the Regional Board in &quot;Solidarność&quot; when it was formed in 1980, and he spent over a year in jail when Poland instituted martial law in 1981.

==Estates==
Members of the Chołodecki family owned small tracts of land and villages in Wołyń and Galicia in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.
The most significant holdings were around Żytomierz, Włodzimierz Wołyński and Łuck, namely the villages of Obłapy, Kudynowce, Ceców, Lachowa, and Nikonówka.
The family also had leaseholds in Galicia, namely Bednarów and Piatydnia.
The family also had close relationships with the Potockis for hundreds of years, administering some of the vast estates of the family, including holdings in Lwów and the Brzoza Stadnicka estate into the 20th century, while a Mikołaj Chołodecki was listed as a reiter for the Potocki&#x27;s as early as 1703.

==Coat of arms==
The Białynia coat of arms is used by the Chołodeckis from Wołyń and Galicia.

<text>The province of Varese () is a province in the Lombardy region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Varese (population of 80,857 inhabitants), but its largest city is Busto Arsizio. The headquarters of AgustaWestland, the company merged into Leonardo since 2016 and the world&#x27;s largest producer of helicopters, is based in Samarate, a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of the province. The province contains 139 &quot;comuni&quot; (: &quot;comune&quot;).

As of 2015, it has a population of 889,410 inhabitants over an area of .

==History==

In Roman times, the fortified settlements of Castelseprio and the port of Angera were of high importance in the region. The House of Visconti conquered the region in the 13th century and completely destroyed Castelseprio. The House of Visconti used the land for agricultural purposes and as part of the territories of Milan. During this Visconti rule, Varese became prosperous due to high levels of trade in the region but remained small. Prior to his appointment as Duke, Francesco III d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena lived in the region during the 18th century. While the unification of Italy was initiating, Italian general Giuseppe Garibaldi attempted to install anti-Austrians in Varese; in response to this, the Austrians attempted to invade in 1859, and a battle occurred in Varese, resulting in Garibaldi&#x27;s victory. During the second half of the 19th century, the area saw considerable economic growth with the birth of numerous factories, especially in the paper, mechanical, and textile industries. Umberto Bossi was born in 1941 near Varese, who believed that the region of Lombardy should have a degree of independence; in 1986, he founded the Lombard League which became a component of the Lega Nord (&quot;North League&quot;).

==Geography==

The province of Varese is one of twelve provinces in the region of Lombardy, northern Italy. It is the most northwesterly province in the region and its northern border forms the international boundary with Switzerland. The province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola in the Piedmont region lies to the northwest and the province of Novara, also in Piedmont, to the west. To the south lies the Metropolitan City of Milan, and to the east, the province of Monza and Brianza, and the province of Como. The provincial capital is the city of Varese, which is situated beside Lake Varese at the foot of Sacro Monte di Varese, part of the Campo dei Fiori di Varese mountain range; the city is also close to the Cinque Vette Park.

==Economy==
The agriculture of this sub-Alpine region is based on livestock farming and the economy mainly relies on the industrial sector, with many people commuting daily to Milan. Among the main companies headquartered in the province are Alenia Aermacchi (aeronautics), AgustaWestland (aeronautics), Bticino (metalworking), Cagiva (motorcycles), Birrificio Angelo Poretti (brewery), Ignis (home appliances), Vibram (footwear soles). In the past the province was famous for its textile industry, especially in the Olona Valley and the Busto Arsizio-Gallarate area, but this has gradually declined since the 1970s. Likewise, Varese was the birthplace of some of Italy&#x27;s main aircraft manufacturers; in addition to the already-mentioned Aermacchi and AgustaWestland, Savoia Marchetti was also born here.

There are local cheeses made from goat&#x27;s milk and local meat dishes, and there are freshwater fish caught in the many lakes. Other local products are a local variety of asparagus, chestnuts, berries and honey, and grapes grown locally are made into traditional red and white wines.
== Cuisine ==

Common in the whole Insubria area is &quot;bruscitti&quot; (; , ; ) an Italian single-course meal of the Lombard, Piedmontese, and Ticinese cuisines based on finely chopped beef cooked for a long time. It is a typical winter dish and is served with polenta, purée or . is originally from the (municipality) of Busto Arsizio, Lombardy, Italy. &quot;Bruscitti&quot; is widespread in northwestern Lombardy (Italy), northeastern Piedmont (Italy), and lower Ticino (Switzerland). The dish probably originated in the Middle Ages. Based on finely chopped beef and cooked for a long time (from 2 to 4 hours) on a low flame, the other ingredients of the dish are butter, garlic, fennel seeds, and lard or pancetta. At the end of cooking, it is blended with well-structured red wines such as Barbera, Barolo or Nebbiolo.

==Education==
In Gorla Minore, a municipality in the province of Varese, there is Collegio Rotondi, a Catholic charter school established in 1599.

<doc id="1173844" wikidata="Q5357499" url="?curid=1173844" title="Electric Slide">
<text>The Electric (better known as The Electric Slide) is a four wall line dance. Choreographer and dancer Richard L. &quot;Ric&quot; Silver claims to have created the dance in 1976.

Dance popularity is sometimes attributed to its setting to Marcia Griffiths and Bunny Wailer&#x27;s song &quot;Electric Boogie&quot;, which was written and recorded for the first time in December 1982.
There are several variations of the dance. The original choreography has 22 steps, but variants include the Freeze (16-step), Cowboy Motion (24-step), Cowboy Boogie (24 step), and the Electric Slide 2 (18-step). The 18-step variation became popular in 1989 and for ten years was listed by &quot;Linedancer Magazine&quot; as the number-one dance in the world.

The original dance was choreographed to be danced in two lines facing each other and in the course the opposite dancers circle each other.

== Controversy ==
In 2007, Silver filed DMCA-based take-down notices to YouTube users who posted videos of people performing the 18-step dance variation. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed suit on behalf of videographer Kyle Machulis against Silver, asking the court to protect Machulis&#x27;s free speech rights in recording a few steps of the dance in a documentary video posted to the Internet. On May 22, 2007, the EFF came to an agreement to settle the lawsuit: the settlement states that Silver will license the Electric Slide under a Creative Commons noncommercial license and to also post the new license on any of his current or future websites that mention the Electric Slide.

In recent decades, there has been some controversy regarding the creation year of the Electric Slide line dance. Silver claimed that he received a demo of the song &#x27;Electric Boogie&#x27; in 1976, which he used to create his dance steps. However according to Marcia Griffiths, the song &#x27;Electric Boogie&#x27; was written for her by Bunny Wailer in early 1980s.

<text>A Mersey flat is a type of doubled-ended barge, that were commonly used on the River Mersey.

==Construction==

Traditionally, the hull was built of oak and the deck was pitch pine. Some had a single mast, with a fore-and-aft rig, while some had an additional mizzen mast. Despite having a flat bottom and curved sides, they were quite stable. They were common from the 1730s to 1890s.

The length of a flat was from long, with a draught and a beam of 14 feet 9 inches to 17 feet (4.5 to 5.2 m). They could carry up to 80 tons of cargo, and this size allowed them to work along the Bridgewater Canal, the Sankey Canal and the northern parts of the Shropshire Union Canal. The Weaver flat was a larger version of the Mersey flat, measuring . Its draught was and when fully loaded, could carry 250 tons.

==Naming==

As the name suggests, these flats originated on the River Mersey, but they were also used on the rivers Irwell and Weaver.

==Usage==

Most Mersey flats had been converted to dumb barges by the end of the 19th century, towed by horses or by steam tugs. The larger Weaver flats were fitted with steam engines, and later with diesel engines, although there were still around 20 working by sail in 1935. Both the Liverpool Maritime Museum and the Ellesmere Port Museum have a Mersey flat in their collections, neither of which actually worked under sail.

<doc id="1173854" wikidata="Q3020425" url="?curid=1173854" title="Tourist guy">
<text>The &quot;tourist guy&quot; was an internet phenomenon that featured a photograph of a tourist on the observation deck of the World Trade Center digitally altered to show a plane about to hit the tower in the background during the September 11 attacks. The photo went viral in the days after the attacks as many manipulated pictures spread online. The man in the photograph was identified as Hungarian Péter Guzli, who took the photo in 1997. Guzli said he edited the photo as a joke for his friends and did not intend for it to spread across the internet.

He is also called numerous other names, including the &quot;accidental tourist&quot; (a reference to the novel and film &quot;The Accidental Tourist&quot;), &quot;Waldo&quot; (a reference to &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo?&quot;), the &quot;WTC Guy&quot;, and the &quot;tourist of death&quot;.

==Origin==
Shortly after 9/11, an image surfaced on the internet, purportedly from a camera found in the debris of the World Trade Center. 
=== Composition ===
The image showed a man, dressed in a wool cap, heavy jacket, and backpack, standing on the observation deck of the World Trade Center. Below him, a jet plane can be seen flying towards the building. Because of its closeness and low altitude, it seems certain to collide with the tower. The picture purported to be one taken mere moments before the attacks on the World Trade Center began.

==Inconsistencies==
Hoaxapedia from the Museum of Hoaxes&#x27; online encyclopedia listed some of the inconsistencies that ultimately confirmed that the photograph was a hoax. These include:

* The temperature in New York City was on the morning of the attacks, yet the man in the photo is wearing heavy clothing consistent with winter weather.
* The man would have been standing on the South Tower, which had an observation deck; yet the North Tower, without such a deck, was the first to be hit, thus refuting the claim that the photo was taken prior to the beginning of the attacks. It is unlikely that anyone would be posing for a photo after the North Tower was hit.
* Within seconds of the first impact, the South Tower’s rooftop was engulfed by smoke from the North Tower, which was directed southeast by prevailing winds from the northwest. Not only would this have prevented the man from standing on the observation deck for any length of time, but the forgery depicts the observation deck as being clear of smoke and debris.
* United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower from the south. However, it is evident from the fact that Midtown Manhattan is in the background behind the man that the plane in this photo is approaching from the north, consistent with American Airlines Flight 11. The plane in the picture clearly displays the American Airlines livery on its nose.
* Both planes that were flown into the towers were Boeing 767s, whereas a Boeing 757 is shown in this photo.
* The plane likely would have been blurred in the photo due to its high speed before impact.
* Both planes crashed while banking to the left. Here the plane is seen flying perfectly level, with no banking.
* The photographer was not likely to proceed with taking the picture after seeing the airplane about to crash into the building.
* If the photo was taken on a digital camera, the camera would not have likely survived such a fall.
* The observation deck on the South Tower normally opened at 9:30 a.m. but Flight 175 struck the south tower at 9:02:59 a.m.
* The white balance of the two photographs is far off. If the plane were part of the photograph, it would appear more yellow. This can be confirmed by comparison with the deck rail at the bottom of the photograph; the plane had nearly the same tint as the deck, while in the photo the two parts show obviously different color.
* The image’s timestamp appears to have been added during post editing with a paint program, rather than one created by an actual camera.
* Shadows of certain items are not cast correctly in the photo. This proves that the image was edited, as certain objects in the image do not cast shadows corresponding to the same light sources in the picture.

==Later appearances==

The picture became a widely known example of an internet meme. As its fame spread, other people started to use the same tourist for other pictures. They included the tourist present at the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, at the John F. Kennedy assassination, the destruction of Air France Flight 4590 and at the Hindenburg disaster. In one version, the aircraft has been replaced with a Melbourne tram. Other pictures show him present at disastrous events in movies, like the destruction of the White House in &quot;Independence Day&quot;, Godzilla demolishing Tokyo, or as the bus driver in &quot;Speed&quot;. There are also pictures of him together with people from other famous digitally manipulated pictures, such as Bert from &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

==Identity==
The first person who claimed to be the tourist was the Brazilian businessman José Roberto Penteado. When Penteado started to get media attention, including an offer to be in a Volkswagen commercial, a 25-year-old Hungarian man, Péter Guzli, came forward as the real tourist. Guzli says, however, that he does not want publicity and did not originally release his last name.

Guzli took the photo on November 28, 1997, and was also responsible for the initial edit. He said he edited the image for a few friends, not realizing it would spread so quickly across the Internet. He first provided the original undoctored photo and several other photos from the same series as proof to a Hungarian newspaper. Later on, the show &quot;Wired News&quot; examined the evidence and confirmed that Guzli was the real tourist guy.

<text>Vendetta Red is an American alternative rock band from Seattle, Washington, that was formed in 1998. They released an EP, &quot;6 Kisses, A Blatant Reminder of Why We Are Alive&quot;, in 1999 and two albums, &quot;Blackout Analysis&quot; in 2000 and &quot;White Knuckled Substance&quot; in 2001, before signing their first major label deal with Epic Records.

Their first release on Epic, &quot;Between the Never and the Now&quot;, charted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers and No. 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2003 with the album&#x27;s single, &quot;Shatterday&quot;, peaking at No. 16 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

The group&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Sisters of the Red Death&quot;, was released in 2005 and charted at No. 21 on the Top Heatseeker&#x27;s Chart. After a series of lineup changes, the group disbanded in 2006, but announced a reunion four years later.

==History==
===Early career (1998–2002)===
The group was formed in 1998 by Erik Chapman, Joseph Childres, Justin Cronk, Zach Davidson, Adam Garcia, and Mike Vermillion in Seattle, Washington and nearly a year later they issued their debut release, the &quot;6 Kisses, A Blatant Reminder of Why We Are Alive EP&quot; with a tour of the West Coast following after. A year later, they released their first album, &quot;Blackout Analysis&quot;, with their second album, &quot;White Knuckled Substance&quot;, being released by Loveless Records in October the next year, which was well received by local radio, with the band continuing to tour on the West Coast. During their tour, they gained the attention of a number of labels and eventually signed with Epic Records in 2002.

===Major label years (2003–2006)===
After finishing recording with the late Jerry Finn, the group&#x27;s first major label album &quot;Between the Never and the Now&quot;, which was preceded by the EP &quot;Cut Your Noose&quot;, was released in June 2003 and charted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers and No. 101 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Shatterday&quot;, peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. The album included reworked songs from their previous release, &quot;White Knuckled Substance&quot;. The band supported the album with a North American tour, which included a stint on the Warped Tour. The song &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, from the album &quot;White Knuckled Substance&quot;, was included on the &quot;Warped Tour 2002 Tour Compilation&quot;.

After opening for AC/DC at the New York Roseland Ballroom, singer Zach Davidson said that the fans during the show were acting &quot;blatantly homophobic&quot;:

They continued to tour, playing with the likes of Dashboard Confessional, Brand New and MxPx.

The group entered the studio in 2004 with the producer Howard Benson to record the follow-up to &quot;Between the Never and the Now&quot;. For the album, Childres switched to keyboards with Burke Thomas added to the group to record drums. The drummer from Street Drum Corps, Bobby Alt, contributed theremin to the album while Phil Perrone contributed backing vocals. The album, titled &quot;Sisters of the Red Death&quot;, was released in 2005 and charted at No. 21 on the Top Heatseeker&#x27;s Chart.

Late in 2004, Chapman and Childres left the group and the guitarist Leif Andersen of Common Heroes and Pris joined the band on lead guitar and keyboards. In late 2005 Vermillion left the band and bass guitarist Jeff Rouse, of Alien Crime Syndicate and Loaded was added to the group.

===Breakup (2006)===
Vendetta Red announced on MySpace on March 8, 2006, that they were going separate ways to create different styles of music. Davidson later made the following statement:

Vendetta Red played their final show at El Corazon in Seattle, Washington, on April 8, 2006. They ended their set with &quot;A Joyless Euphoria&quot;.

===Post-breakup (2006–2010)===
Following the breakup, Davidson, Andersen and Rouse formed Sirens Sister in 2006 along with the drummer Ben Libey. They signed to The Control Group and released their first album, &quot;Echoes from the Ocean Floor&quot;, in September 2006, produced by Martin Feveyear. In 2007, Rouse left the group and was replaced by Andersen&#x27;s brother, Levi Andersen, on bass guitar with the group going on to release &quot;Unspeakable Things&quot; in 2009 on The Control Group recorded by John Goodmanson and mixed by Martin Feveyear in Seattle.

Vermillion enjoyed a solo career now playing his own folk and American roots songs as well as covering many classic but perhaps lesser-known American country artists such as Townes Van Zandt, Merle Haggard and Jim Croce. He plays shows frequently in the Seattle area and also DJs under the name &quot;Sad Bastard&quot;, usually playing country, Motown, folk and soul. His first official full-length solo album was released on May 21, 2008.

Cronk is now playing drums for With Friends Like These. The band includes fellow Bakersfield native Matthew Shaw, local producer Tyler Coffey and Brian Pake. Cronk owns a recording studio with bandmate Coffey in Seattle called The Toy Box.

Chapman has been enjoying life outside of the music industry as a bar tender at a Seattle area up-scale bar. He was married in 2006 to Andrea and they currently reside in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle.

Their song &quot;Silhouette Serenade&quot; is used in the video game &quot;Saints Row&quot;.

Childres was playing for Blood Hot Beat. He was reported dead on June 3, 2020.

Thomas formed a band called Megasapien with Lian Light (formerly of Magneto). Their second album was expected to be released at the end of March 2011.

===Reunion (2010–present)===
In December 2010, it was announced that Vendetta Red would reunite for a one-off show at El Corazon in Seattle on March 5, 2011. This turned out to be an extended reunion. The band members later announced they had also begun working on new material and had enlisted the noted rock/metal producer Terry Date to produce what would be their first album in six years.

Vendetta Red performed some of this new material at Bumbershoot 2011, as well as material from their previous studio albums, a Sirens Sister song, and a solo (Davidson) acoustic version of Seconds Away. A new song called Blank Screens was released on January 15, 2012 as a single on various digital music services including iTunes, and the album title &quot;Scripture&quot; was announced.

On January 24, 2017, Vendetta Red announced on their Facebook page that they had signed with Cleopatra Records and were in the process of recording the new album. The album, titled &quot;Quinceañera&quot;, was released on April 13, 2018.

<text>Daniel Edward Lungren (born September 22, 1946) is an American lawyer, lobbyist, and former politician. A native of Long Beach, California, his career as an elected official began when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a Republican, representing the Long Beach area from 1979 to 1989. He then served as attorney general of California from 1991 to 1999, and ran unsuccessfully for governor of California in 1998, losing to Democrat Gray Davis. 

In 2005, he returned to Congress, representing , which covered most of Sacramento County, portions of Solano County, as well as all of Alpine County, Amador County and Calaveras County. In 2012, his seat was redistricted, and he sought re-election in , losing to Democrat Ami Bera.

==Early life, education and private career==
Daniel Edward Lungren was born in Long Beach, California, on September 22, 1946, to a family of Irish, Swedish and Scottish descent. From 1952, Lungren&#x27;s father, John, was the personal physician to and a close friend of former President Richard Nixon.

Lungren graduated from St. Anthony High School in 1964 and matriculated to the University of Notre Dame, where he earned an A.B. degree with honors in English in 1968. He returned to California to chair Youth for Nixon during Nixon&#x27;s first successful run for the presidency. He anticipated military service during the Vietnam War but was ruled ineligible due to a knee injury he sustained while playing football in high school.

Lungren began his legal studies at the University of Southern California Law School but transferred to Georgetown University Law Center, where he earned his J.D. degree in 1971. During his years at Georgetown, Lungren worked for Republican U.S. Senators George Murphy of California and Bill Brock of Tennessee. From 1971 to 1972, he was Special Assistant to the co-chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC); Lungren&#x27;s wife, Bobbi, worked in the Nixon White House at the time. When Lungren returned to Long Beach, he joined a law firm and practiced civil law for a short time before running unsuccessfully for Congress in 1976. He was successful in 1978.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1979–1989)==
Lungren first served in the House of Representatives from 1979 to 1989, representing portions of Long Beach and Orange County. Radley Balko wrote in 2012: &quot;Lungren rose in stature with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, and quickly became a darling of the tough-on-crime crowd and the rising moral majority movement.&quot; He was one of Newt Gingrich&#x27;s chief lieutenants during this time; he was a founding member of the Conservative Opportunity Society. He served on the House Judiciary Committee, where he pushed for &quot;tough on crime&quot; legislation. In 1984, Lungren sponsored the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, &quot;at the time one of the most sweeping pieces of anti-crime legislation in U.S. history.&quot; In addition, he supported asset forfeiture as a weapon in the War on Drugs, saying he wanted to &quot;[m]ake it illegal for a dry cleaner or a grocery store to take money from a drug dealer (...) and if they do, seize the business. Put the merchant in jail.&quot; 

Lungren also supported sanctions against employers who hired illegal immigrants, but also favored a temporary guest-worker program. He was the principal House cosponsor of the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill, which became the Immigration Reform Act of 1986. He also independently sponsored a &quot;guest worker&quot; bill, designed to allow for importation of &quot;temporary&quot; immigrant laborers.

==California statewide offices==
In late 1987, California Governor George Deukmejian attempted to appoint Lungren to fill a vacancy in the office of California State Treasurer. The state Assembly confirmed Lungren&#x27;s appointment, but the state Senate rejected it. Arguing that only one house of the Legislature needed to confirm him, Lungren took his case to the California Supreme Court; while pursuing this action, he did not seek re-election to the U.S. House. On June 23, 1988, the state Supreme Court ruled that both houses of the legislature had to confirm Lungren&#x27;s appointment; he thus found himself out of a job in both Washington, D.C. and Sacramento.

Lungren was elected Attorney General of California in 1990 and re-elected in 1994. He ran as a staunch supporter of capital punishment, and in 1992, executions resumed in California after a 25-year pause, with a total of five occurring under his tenure. He also helped pass legislation such as &quot;Megan&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;3-Strikes-and-You&#x27;re-Out&quot;, &quot;Sexual Anti-Predator Act&quot; and the &quot;California&#x27;s Safe Schools Plan&quot;. He also sponsored a law allowing minors as young as 14 who are accused of murder to be tried as adults and &quot;led a national effort to limit lawsuits filed by prisoners, which produced the federal Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996.&quot; His 1993 letter to five major video game publishers and seven major video game retailers, asking them &quot;to stop the manufacturing, licensing, distribution, or sale of any video game that portrays graphic and gratuitous violence&quot;, was called &quot;the strongest anti-violence statement yet from a top government official&quot; by the gaming press, even with Lungren&#x27;s accompanying statement that he was strictly making an appeal to the companies&#x27; sense of civic responsibility and not calling for any form of government censorship. In 1996, he was considered as a possible vice presidential candidate to run with Republican nominee Bob Dole. That same year, Lungren &quot;vigorously opposed&quot; Proposition 215, which legalized medical marijuana in California.

In 1998, Lungren was the Republican candidate for governor of California, running against Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gray Davis. During the campaign, Davis maintained that Lungren, who presented himself as the political heir to former California Governor and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, was too conservative for California. Davis also criticized Lungren&#x27;s hesitancy, as California Attorney General, to enforce laws restricting assault weapons and his waiting until the last minute to become part of a class action lawsuit against the cigarette industry. Lungren touted his crime policies and promoted the economic records of the two preceding Republican governors, George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson. On election day, Davis won with 57.9% of the vote, while Lungren got 38.4%.

==U.S. House of Representatives (2005–2013)==
In 2004 Lungren was elected to California&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, which included several rural and exurban areas east of Sacramento. He had moved to Gold River, a Sacramento suburb, in the 1990s.

Lungren was reappointed to the Judiciary Committee based on his previous five terms of seniority; he also served on the Homeland Security Committee. In 2005, Lungren supported the USA PATRIOT Act, which renewed the federal government&#x27;s ability to perform secret surveillance including wiretaps of citizens and monitoring of public and private computer packet-switched networks to prevent terrorism from hitting the United States. In 2006, Lungren and fellow U.S. Representative Jane Harman authored the SAFE Port Act, which improves security at the ports including additional requirements for maritime facilities, foreign port assessments, container security initiatives and Customs Trade Partnership against Terrorism. The bill passed the House with bipartisan support. Also in 2006, he sponsored the &quot;Streamlined Procedures Act&quot; which &quot;would strip federal courts of the power to review &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petitions in state death penalty cases.&quot; In 2007, Lungren was appointed to the House Administration Committee.

Lungren stated that he opposed &quot;any bill brought to the floor of the House that includes an amnesty provision that confers citizenship status.&quot; He cited his concern as the millions of &quot;legal immigrants who wait years in order to obtain permanent residence and citizenship.&quot; Lungren was an opponent of &quot;the huge growth of spending earmarks.&quot; Described as a &quot;maverick&quot;, he &quot;cited the need for the party to adopt more fiscally conservative policies.&quot;

On July 29, 2008, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 6295, introduced by Lungren. This legislation was to stop the use of submersible and semi-submersible vessels used to transport drugs and other contraband that pose a threat to communities and national security. Shortly after the 2008 election, a newly reelected Lungren challenged John Boehner for House Minority Leader. Although Lungren did not win the post, Boehner appointed him as Ranking Member of the House Administration Committee. To serve in this new role, he left his seat on the Budget Committee. Lungren became Chairman of the House Administration Committee when Republicans took control of the House in January 2011. &quot;The Cook Political Report&quot; by the &quot;National Journal&quot; named Lungren the Republican most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012.

Lungren lost his reelection bid for California&#x27;s 7th congressional district, reapportioned after the 2010 United States census, in the November 2012 election, won by the Democratic challenger, Ami Bera, by a margin of 5,700 votes – 51.1% to 48.9%.

==Political campaigns==
===2004===
Lungren ran for Congress again in the 3rd congressional district after six-year incumbent U.S. Representative Doug Ose announced his retirement. Lungren stated that his desire to serve in Congress again was rekindled by the September 11 attacks. He won a come from behind victory in a three-way primary against Mary Ose (sister of Doug) and State Senator Rico Oller in 2004.

===2010===

Lungren was challenged by Democratic nominee Ami Bera, a physician by occupation, American Independent Jerry Leidecker, Peace and Freedom nominee Mike Roskey and Libertarian Douglas Arthur Tuma. Lungren was reelected with 50.6% of the vote, with Bera accumulating 42.7% and 6.7% for other candidates.

===2012===

After the 2010 U.S. Census, Lungren&#x27;s district was renumbered as the 7th district. It lost all of its territory outside Sacramento County and had a more evenly divided registration of Republicans and Democrats than its predecessor. He again faced Democrat Ami Bera in the November general election. With the 7th seen as a swing district, the race was described as a potential &quot;PAC Battlefield&quot;. In one of the most-watched House races nationally, both sides poured in millions of dollars for their campaigns. Bera was ultimately elected to the seat, with 51.7% of the vote to Lungren&#x27;s 48.3%

==Later career==
After leaving Congress, Lungren co-founded the lobbying firm Lungren Lopina LLC. In 2018, he joined the law firm King &amp; Spalding, working from their offices in Washington, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

Other than his work for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Standpoint&quot; he has had articles published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, among other publications. He has also contributed book reviews mainly to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. He has contributed to a number of journals including &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; and the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;.

==Critical reviews of &quot;Kosovo: A Short History&quot;==
Malcolm&#x27;s book &quot;Kosovo: A Short History&quot; (1998) was the subject of an extended debate in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. The debate began with a review of the book by Aleksa Djilas, a former Fellow of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, who wrote that the book was &quot;marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans&quot;. Malcolm responded that Djilas had not produced any evidence to counter the evidence in the book, and had instead resorted to belittling both Malcolm and his work, including the use of personal slurs and patronising language. The debate continued with Serbian-born Professor Stevan K. Pavlowitch of the University of Southampton asserting that Malcolm&#x27;s book lacked precision, Melanie McDonagh of the Bosnian Institute claiming that Djilas&#x27;s review took a &quot;nationalistic approach&quot;, and Norman Cigar of Marine Corps University stating that Djilas was trying to create myths to legitimise Serbian actions in Kosovo.

Other reviews of &quot;Kosovo: A Short History&quot; were varied. For example, in &quot;English Historical Review&quot;, Zbyněk Zeman observed that Malcolm &quot;tries not to take sides&quot;, but in &quot;American Historical Review&quot;, Nicholas J. Miller stated that the book was &quot;conceptually flawed&quot; by Malcolm&#x27;s insistence on treating Kosovo as &quot;a place on its own; [rather than as] a scrap of &quot;irredenta&quot; that Serbs and Albanians fight over&quot;.

Later the same year, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of Gustavus Adolphus College, Minnesota, reviewed the book in the &quot;Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online&quot; and, while praising aspects of the book, also asserted that it was &quot;shaped by the author&#x27;s overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths&quot;. He claimed that Malcolm was &quot;partisan&quot; and complained that the book made a &quot;transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false&quot;. Malcolm responded in the same journal in early 2000, asserting that the book challenged both Albanian and Serbian myths about Kosovo, but that there were more Serbian myths about Kosovo than Albanian ones and this explained the greater coverage of Serbian myths in the book. He also observed that Emmert&#x27;s perspective and work were largely within the framework of Serbian historiography, and that that was the reason for Emmert&#x27;s assertion that Malcolm was &quot;partisan&quot;. Emmert also criticized Malcolm&#x27;s opposition to the Serbian claim to Kosovo as the &quot;cradle of civilization&quot;, stating that Kosovo did become the center of medieval Serbia and that such feelings among modern Serbs should not be disputed. He also noted the absence of Serbian archives. Likewise, Tim Judah and Misha Glenny criticized Malcolm for not using Serbian sources in the book. He responded that there were no proper Serbian archives for that period of history, but also noted that he had studied a large number of works by Serbian and Montenegrin authors.

A 2006 study by historian Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo such as Noel Malcolm&#x27;s book. Anscombe noted that Malcolm offered &quot;a detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo&#x27;s history&quot; and that his work marked a &quot;remarkable reversal&quot; of previous acceptance by western historians of the &quot;Serbian account&quot; regarding the migration of the Serbs (1690) from Kosovo.

Malcolm has been criticized for being &quot;anti-Serbian&quot; and selective with sources, while other critics have concluded that &quot;his arguments are unconvincing&quot;. The majority of the documents that Malcolm used were written by adversaries of the Ottoman state or by officials with limited experience of the region. Anscombe notes that Malcolm, like Serbian and Yugoslav historians who have ignored his conclusions, have not considered indigenous evidence such as that from the Ottoman archive when composing national history.

In a 2007 work, Serbian historian Dušan T. Bataković claimed that Malcolm&#x27;s book about Kosovo was &quot;notoriously pro-Albanian&quot;. Frederick Anscombe has accused Bataković of writing several works in the 1980s and 1990s which advanced a Serbian nationalist perspective regarding Kosovo.

<text>Earsdon is a village in the borough of North Tyneside in the county of Tyne and Wear, England. It sits on the border of Northumberland, which it is historically part of, and is approximately two miles from Whitley Bay. The village had a population of 613 in 2011.

== History ==
Earsdon was an urban district from 1897 to 1935, consisting of the four parishes of Earsdon, Backworth, Holywell, and Murton. Earsdon Urban District and parish was abolished on 1 April 1935, with the majority of the area going to Seaton Valley, apart from small areas which went to Tynemouth and Whitley and Monkseaton. In 1931 the parish had a population of 5965.

== Features ==
The graveyard of St Alban&#x27;s Anglican church is home to a memorial to the 204 men and boys killed in the Hartley Colliery disaster of 1862, at the nearby village of New Hartley. There is also a war memorial in the village.

A second church, Earsdon Methodist Chapel, is located within a former quarry.

There is a disused coal mine works a short distance from the village, including the Fenwick Heap. After closure, the heap spontaneously combusted underground and was burning internally until work started to reclaim the land. The reclamation work started in 2009 and was completed in September 2010.

== In fiction ==
* The children&#x27;s television series &quot;Supergran&quot; was filmed in part in the village.
* The Beehive Inn near Earsdon was used for the filming of the 1976 film The Likely Lads.

<text>Kupil (, ; ; , ) is a village (&quot;selo&quot;) in Khmelnytskyi Raion (district) of Khmelnytskyi Oblast (province) of western Ukraine. It belongs to Viitivtsi settlement hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine.

== History ==
Settlement in Kupil began in the 18th century, when it had long been part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Czartoryski family owned the estate of which Kupiel was a part and they erected a palace by the village. The forced Partitions of Poland at the end of that century incorporated the area into the Russian Empire where it stayed until the Soviet take-over after World War I. The population was made up of Ukrainians, Poles and Jews all of whom had previously been Polish citizens.

During World War II, the invading German army occupied the town on July 5, 1941, following the commencement of Operation Barbarossa. Jewish people were kept imprisoned in a local ghetto and used to perform forced labour. On September 21, 1942, about 600 Jewish inhabitants of Kupil were taken to Volochisk and executed outside the town. The remaining Jewish inhabitants were shot dead at the town&#x27;s cemetery. Kupil was liberated from German occupation by the Red Army in March 1944.

The Hebrew scholar William Chomsky was born in Kupil in 1896. He later moved to the United States. William is the father of Noam Chomsky and David.

The Yiddish writer Chaim Bejder was born in Kupil in 1920. He was an editor of the only Jewish magazine in the Soviet Union, &quot;Sovetish Heymland&quot;. He moved to the United States in 1996 and died in the state of New York in 2003.

<text>Fahrwangen is a municipality in the district of Lenzburg in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

==History==

Prehistorical finds from various Neolithic eras, Roman and Alamanni ruins all testify to a long history of human habitation around Fahrwangen. The modern municipality of Fahrwangen is first mentioned in 924 as &quot;Farnowanch&quot;. Under the Habsburgs both the high and low justice were brought together with the County of Tennwil. Between 1354 and 1380 the Lords of Hallwyl acquired all rights to the municipality. Under the Hallwyls and later under Bern, Fahrwangen was a special, independent high court.

During the second Villmergen war in 1712, Fahrwangen was used as a camp by the Reformed troops. As the Catholic troops attacked, according to legend, the women of Fahrwangen and Meisterschwanden marched out to join the soldiers. The Protestant Bernese troops were so impressed with the valor of the women, that they granted them a day when the women could command. Since then, on the second Sunday in January they have celebrated the &quot;Meitlisunntig&quot; (Girls&#x27; Sunday). On this day, women from both villages run through the streets carrying nets. Any man who is captured in a net must pay his &quot;Lösegelds&quot; or ransom (often in the form of alcoholic drinks) to get free.

Since 1920 it has had a district school.

Religiously, it was originally part of the parish of Sarmenstorf, and between 1531 and 1817 it was in the parish of Seengen. After 1817 it became its own Reformed parish, which included Meisterschwanden.

Economically, until the 18th century, it was a farming village. Agriculture was partly replaced in the 18th century by cotton weaving, and in the 19th century by straw plaiting both at home and in factories. In the 20th century other industries moved into the village. Continuously, since the early 20th century, a high proportion of the population is employed in industry (1920–70 over 60%, 2000 58%). Since 1980 more workers commute out of Fahrwangen than commute in for jobs.

<doc id="1173884" wikidata="Q1065095" url="?curid=1173884" title="Charlie Joiner">
<text>Charles Joiner Jr. (born October 14, 1947) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for 18 seasons. He played 11 seasons with the San Diego Chargers, with whom he earned all three of his Pro Bowl selections, and was named first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press in 1980. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996.

Joiner played college football with the Grambling Tigers and was a three-time, first-team all-conference selection in the Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC). He was selected as a defensive back in the fourth round of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft by the AFL&#x27;s Houston Oilers, who soon returned him to the wide receiver position. Joiner played three and a half seasons each for the Oilers (1969–1972) and Cincinnati Bengals (1972–1975), missing substantial time through injuries with both teams.

Cincinnati traded Joiner to the Chargers, with whom he played for eleven seasons (1976–1986). He made the Pro Bowl in his first year with the team, but his role was reduced in the following two seasons, nearly leading him to retire as early as 1978. Joiner&#x27;s career was revitalised once head coach Don Coryell installed his Air Coryell passing offense. He had three consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons from 1979 to 1981, making two further Pro Bowls (1979–1980) and the 1980 All-Pro team.

He retired with the most career receptions, receiving yards, and games played of any wide receiver in NFL history. He was noted for his precise route running, as well as his longevity and late-career success, with 586 of his 750 regular season catches coming after he joined the Chargers. Joiner went on to serve as a wide receivers coach for twenty-six years before retiring completely after the 2012 season.

== Early life ==
Charles Joiner Jr. was born on October 14, 1947, in Many, Louisiana, the only child in a low income family; his father, Charlie Sr., was a truck driver. Joiner attended W. O. Boston High School in Lake Charles, Louisiana. He did not play football until his junior year, preferring baseball, but excelled as an all-state receiver while doubling as a defensive back. He scored 110 points as a senior, the most in the area. Joiner also played high school basketball and was a district champion javelin thrower.

== College career==

Joiner&#x27;s parents could not afford to send him to college, but his high school coach told him football would be a good way to earn a scholarship. He was able to secure a place at Grambling College—now known as Grambling State University—to play for head coach Eddie Robinson&#x27;s Tigers. Future NFL starter James Harris was the Tigers&#x27; primary quarterback throughout Joiner&#x27;s four years at the college, each of which resulted in a Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) Championship.

After seeing some play on both offense and defense as a freshman, Joiner had a breakout sophomore year as a receiver; he caught 34 passes for 822 yards and 9 touchdowns, and his teammates voted him the Tigers&#x27; Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the season. He continued to feature heavily in the passing game for the next two years, setting a Grambling record with 42 catches as a senior, going for 733 yards and 8 touchdowns. He scored two more touchdowns in his final college game, a victory in the 1968 Pasadena Bowl. He was a three-time first-team All-SWAC selection (1966–1968), and finished with 2,066 career receiving yards.

Joiner later credited Robinson as a great inspiration who also pushed him to complete his college degree in accountancy. In 2013, Joiner was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame.

== Professional playing career ==

=== Houston Oilers (1969–1972) ===

==== 1969 season ====
Joiner graduated from Grambling in 1969 and was selected in the fourth round of the 1969 NFL/AFL draft with the 93rd overall pick by the American Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers. A &quot;Corpus Christi Times&quot; draft review described him as a having &quot;great speed (4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash) and excellent hands.&quot; The Oilers drafted Joiner with intent to use him at defensive back; this upset Robinson, who stated his former player could &quot;beat any defensive back one-on-one&quot; in a press release urging Houston to keep him on offense. Joiner&#x27;s own expectation was that he would &quot;play a few years,&quot; qualify for an NFL pension and then move on to another career.
The Oilers eventually chose to play Joiner both ways as a rookie, installing him as their fourth wide receiver for the 1969 season. He was playing on offense when his rookie season was brought to an end by injury—he was tackled after making a catch in a week 7 victory over the Denver Broncos and suffered a compound fracture of the right arm. Head coach Wally Lemm described Joiner as a &quot;fine young prospect&quot; after the injury.

==== 1970 season ====
Joiner became an NFL player in 1970 when the Oilers joined that league as part of the AFL–NFL merger. He had another injury setback when he broke an arm in the first preseason game. He missed the first five regular season games before returning to face the San Diego Chargers, producing 5 catches for 100 yards and scoring his first professional touchdown on a 46-yard pass from Jerry Rhome. He scored twice in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals later in the season, one of those on a career-long 87-yard touchdown catch.

==== 1971 season ====
Houston moved Joiner up in their depth chart by trading starting wide receiver Jerry LeVias before the 1971 season; the Oilers&#x27; general manager John W. Breen gave Joiner&#x27;s performance in a preseason scrimmage as a reason for the trade. While the Oilers struggled for much of the season, they had one of the highest ranked passing attacks in the American Football Conference (AFC) and Joiner led the team in both receiving yardage and touchdowns.

==== 1972 season: Traded midseason ====
Houston traded Joiner to Cincinnati six games into the 1972 season, on October 24; he and linebacker Ron Pritchard were sent to the Bengals in exchange for running backs Paul Robinson and Fred Willis. Joiner had been leading the Oilers in receptions with 16, covering 307 yards and 2 touchdowns; he had scored in his final game the day before the trade. He said, &quot;I really didn&#x27;t think it was me they were talking about. I was their leading pass receiver for two years and it really hurt me.&quot;

=== Cincinnati Bengals (1972–1975) ===

==== 1972 season ====
Joiner said of his new team, &quot;You come to a new situation and you may be a little scared, but everyone here has been friendly and it&#x27;s been real good,&quot; adding that he found passes from the Bengals&#x27; quarterbacks to be thrown softer and to be easier to catch.

Cincinnati and Houston were scheduled to meet the Sunday after the trade. Joiner saw limited action with a single catch for 19 yards in a 30–7 win. Overall, he struggled to make an impact with his new team in 1972, catching only eight passes in eight games—he remained on the bench for the entirety of two of these. The &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; described him as a &quot;disappointment&quot; who &quot;never quite measured up.&quot;

==== 1973 season ====
Joiner&#x27;s progress was praised by offensive assistant coach Bill Walsh in the build-up to the 1973 season, with Walsh noting a particular improvement in accurate route running. Nonetheless, he entered the 1973 season with his position in the team under threat after the Bengals selected another wide receiver, Isaac Curtis, in the first round of the NFL draft; Curtis was expected to start as a rookie. Joiner suffered another injury setback in preseason, this time to his knee, and began the regular season on the inactive list. Head coach Paul Brown was impressed by his attitude as he fought to regain fitness after the injury, saying &quot;No man ever worked harder or gave it more to get himself back in shape.&quot; Joiner returned to face the Cleveland Browns after missing three games but was immediately injured again; he caught a 26-yard pass on the Bengals&#x27; first play from scrimmage but suffered a fractured collar bone while being tackled and was believed to be out for the year.

Joiner returned sooner than expected, missing six further games before beginning a consecutive appearance streak that would last for over 13 years. Quarterback Ken Anderson praised Joiner&#x27;s impact, saying that having both he and Curtis on the field stretched the opposing defense, who could not double cover both of them. Joiner finished the season with 13 catches for 134 yards from his five appearances. The Bengals were successful as a team, winning the AFC Central division with a 10–4 record. Joiner&#x27;s first playoff game ended in a 34–16 defeat to the Miami Dolphins. The Bengals&#x27; passing attack was largely shut down, and he caught only two passes for 33 yards.

==== 1974 season ====
Cincinnati gave Joiner a new multi-year contract in the run-up to the 1974 season. He scored his first Bengals touchdown in week 5, a 65-yarder against Cleveland. He shared time with Chip Myers as Curtis&#x27; partner during the year.

==== 1975 season ====
Brown planned to use Joiner together with Myers and second-year receiver John McDaniel as a trio of partners for Curtis in 1975. He was the most successful of the three as the season progressed, posting new career bests of 37 receptions for 726 yards, an average of 19.6 yards per catch. On November 23, 1975, he set a Bengals then-single-game record with 200 receiving yards in a 35–23 loss to Cleveland; it would remain his personal career high.

Cincinnati won a wild card spot in the playoffs with an 11–3 record. They again lost in the first round, this time 31–28 to the Oakland Raiders. Joiner scored his first postseason touchdown as the Bengals came close to rallying from seventeen points behind in the final quarter—he said, &quot;We should have won the ball game, we just ran out of time.&quot; It was his final game as a Bengal.

=== San Diego Chargers (1976–1986) ===

==== 1976 season: Traded again ====

On April 1, Cincinnati traded Joiner to the San Diego Chargers for defensive end Coy Bacon. Brown acknowledged that Joiner was coming off a good year, but identified the defensive line as a stronger area of need for his team. Joiner was happy to reunite with Walsh, who had just joined the Chargers as their offensive coordinator. Chargers quarterback Dan Fouts was impressed by his new receiver in preseason: &quot;I love Charlie Joiner. He has a knack for finding the open spot.&quot;

Joiner became the Chargers&#x27; leading receiver during a successful 1976 season with the team. He had a run of four consecutive 100-yard games early in the year, and secured his first 1,000-yard receiving season with two games to spare. He finished the year with 50 receptions for 1,056 yards (the third most in the league, and 285 more than Curtis had in Cincinnati) while averaging 21.1 yards per catch, and was named second-team All-Pro by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) at season&#x27;s end.

The trade for Joiner benefited both teams in the short term, as both he and Bacon were named to the Pro Bowl and voted MVP by their respective teams that year. Beyond 1976, Bacon only played one more year in Cincinnati, while Joiner&#x27;s career with the Chargers covered a further decade.

==== 1977 season ====

Joiner gave some thought to retirement before committing to play the 1977 season. He was reunited with his Grambling quarterback James Harris on the field, as Fouts was holding out through much of the season. Joiner was often double covered as newly acquired receiver Johnny Rodgers was injured, and their No. 1 draft pick from the year before, running back Joe Washington, was recovering from knee issues. Joiner finished with 35 catches, 542 yards and 6 touchdowns, short of his 1976 performance in each statistic but still enough to lead all Chargers wide receivers.

==== 1978 season ====

Ray Perkins became the Chargers&#x27; offensive coordinator in 1978, their third in three years. He emphasized using running backs as possession receivers and rookie No. 1 pick John Jefferson as the deep threat while phasing out Joiner, who had undergone offseason knee surgery. He informed head coach Tommy Prothro before the season that he was considering retirement, but Prothro was able to persuade him to continue. Don Coryell became San Diego&#x27;s head coach in 1978, replacing Prothro midseason; Coryell had a reputation as an offensive strategist, but largely stuck with Perkins&#x27; system in 1978. Joiner struggled with post-surgery knee problems during the year and finished with 33 receptions, two fewer than in 1976 despite the regular season increasing from fourteen games to sixteen.

==== 1979 season ====

In the 1979 season, Joiner featured heavily in the pass-based offense known as Air Coryell. The Chargers bolstered their receiving corps entering the season by using their first-round draft pick to select tight end Kellen Winslow. Coryell also hired Joe Gibbs as the new offensive coordinator that season after Perkins left for the New York Giants. They noticed that Joiner had been getting open the year before, and envisioned him as a key to their offense.
It was a successful regular season for the Chargers, as they posted a 12–4 record and earned their first divisional title in 14 years. Joiner played a key role in the division-deciding game, a 17–7 win over the Denver Broncos in the regular-season finale. He was forced back to the locker room twice during the game with injuries, but returned to the field bandaged both times. He sustained a concussion during the game and finished it with stitches over one eye, as well as hip and thigh injuries. Joiner finished the game with 3 catches for 58 yards and the game-winning touchdown. It was an inspirational performance with Jefferson unable to play and John Floyd, the Chargers only other receiver, being just a rookie; Coryell later remembered it as &quot;The Charlie Joiner Game.&quot;

Joiner finished second in the AFC in receptions to Baltimore&#x27;s Joe Washington, his former Chargers teammate, with a career-high 72 catches covering 1,008 yards and four touchdowns. His reception total was the most by a Charger since Lance Alworth&#x27;s 73 in 1966, and the most by a player Joiner&#x27;s age (32) in NFL history at that time. Joiner was the third player in league history to catch 70 or more passes after age 30, joining Don Maynard and Ahmad Rashad, who were each 30. He was named to the Pro Bowl, replacing an injured Lynn Swann, who himself was a replacement for Steve Largent. Joiner was the oldest player in the all-star game.

Joiner&#x27;s third playoff game ended in another defeat; his former team, the Oilers, overcame key injuries to surprise the Chargers 17–14 in San Diego. A disappointed Joiner commented: &quot;I think we took it for granted... You got to fight in this game. We let them take it away from us. They wanted it more than we did.&quot;

==== 1980 season ====

Joiner had again expected to retire after the previous season, but returned in 1980 saying he wanted &quot;one more shot at the Super Bowl.&quot; He had a career-high 10 catches in one game in a 44–7 win over the New York Giants, accounting for 171 yards and a touchdown. Joiner finished the year with 71 receptions for 1,132 yards, and teamed with Jefferson and Winslow to become the first trio of receivers on a team to reach 1,000 yards in the same season. The three were all named first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press.

The Chargers won their division again, this time with an 11–5 record. In the divisional playoffs, Joiner&#x27;s 9-yard touchdown catch from Fouts began a comeback that saw the Chargers turn a 14–3 halftime deficit into a 20–14 victory, Joiner&#x27;s first in the playoffs. San Diego progressed to the AFC championship game, where Joiner led the team with 6 catches for 130 yards and two touchdowns, but could not prevent a 34–27 home defeat to the Raiders. Reflecting on a second consecutive season of being eliminated at home, Joiner said, &quot;We have to think about opportunities. We really missed the last two years.&quot;

==== 1981 season ====

Joiner once again considered retirement before the 1981 season, saying &quot;Frankly, I don&#x27;t know how much longer I can play. I feel my skills have diminished.&quot; Nonetheless, he continued his career, beginning the season as the Chargers&#x27; top wide receiver due to Jefferson holding out and eventually being traded. In San Diego&#x27;s opening game at Cleveland, Joiner caught 6 passes for 191 yards, which would be his best total with the Chargers. This prompted Fouts to say, &quot;I don&#x27;t why he&#x27;s so much better than he was when I first saw him, but he is. I&#x27;ve never seen him better.&quot; After another strong performance in week 2, Joiner already had 13 catches for 357 yards on the season, and felt his knees to be in better condition than past seasons. His production decreased in the following weeks as opposing defenses double covered him, but the addition of Wes Chandler to replace Jefferson relieved that pressure. Joiner finished with 70 catches, making him the first receiver with at least 70 catches in three consecutive NFL seasons. He also had a team-leading and career-high 1,188 yards receiving, and the Chargers won their third consecutive AFC West title with a 10–6 record.

In the divisional playoffs, Joiner played a key role in San Diego&#x27;s 41–38 overtime win over the Miami Dolphins, a game that became known as The Epic In Miami. He caught 7 passes for 108 yards, including a 39-yard reception on the penultimate play of the game to set up Rolf Benirschke&#x27;s game-winning 29-yard field goal. The Chargers advanced again to the conference championship, but lost 27–7 to Joiner&#x27;s former team Cincinnati in a game later known as the Freezer Bowl due to frigid gameday conditions.

==== 1982 season ====
Joiner committed to another season in July, signing a new contract. The 1982 season was reduced to nine games by a players&#x27; strike. Joiner had no touchdowns in the regular season, though he did produce three 100-yard games.

San Diego finished 6–3, making the playoffs for the last time in Joiner&#x27;s career. They won their first game 31–28 at the Pittsburgh Steelers, but lost the next 34–13 in Miami, with their powerful offense largely shut down. Joiner scored his only touchdown of the season during the Miami defeat. He said, &quot;The Chargers are human. You can&#x27;t ask everything of us, every game.&quot;

==== 1983 season ====
During the offseason, Joiner intimated that his decision on whether to continue his career might rest on whether Fouts, a free agent, negotiated a new contract with the Chargers. Fouts did eventually sign, and Joiner was back for another season.

The Chargers had a disappointing 1983 campaign; Fouts missed time through injuries, and they finished 6–10. Joiner played the full season despite cracked ribs, he caught 65 passes for 960 yards and 3 touchdowns, and was voted both the most valuable and most inspirational Charger by his teammates. His late-career surge had seen Joiner catch 314 passes in the past five seasons after only catching 282 in his first ten.

==== 1984 season: Career receptions record ====

Joiner quickly expressed an interest in returning for the 1984 season, and said that he was &quot;kind of looking forward to camp.&quot; He nonetheless did not attend his first mandatory practice, as he was holding out for a two-year contract and the Chargers were only offering him one year. Winslow said of his absence, &quot;It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a missing link, the chemistry isn&#x27;t there. It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re missing an ingredient.&quot; The holdout lasted only six days before Joiner agreed to a one-year contract. He entered the season needing 52 receptions to break Charley Taylor&#x27;s NFL record of 649 for a career.

Joiner made little impact during the early part of the season, with only eight catches during the first four games; in week 4 against the Raiders he had no catches at all, ending a streak of 85 consecutive games with a catch (78 regular season, 7 postseason). He improved enough to finish with 61 catches on the year.
Joiner passed Taylor as the career leader in receptions on November 25, 1984, breaking the mark with 6 catches for 70 yards and a touchdown in a 52–24 loss against the Steelers. The record-breaking 650th catch was a 3-yarder from backup quarterback Ed Luther late in the game. Joiner expressed disappointment that the landmark had come in an away game, in a loss, and that Fouts had not thrown the record-breaking pass.

==== 1985 season ====
During the offseason Joiner signed another one-year contract, committing to a tenth year with the Chargers. He stated in training camp that he considered himself &quot;on the bubble&quot; as a player who might struggle to maintain a place in the team at the expense of younger receivers. Joiner continued to play in every game, and passed Jackie Smith&#x27;s record of 210 appearances at a receiving position early in the season. He finished the 1985 season with 59 catches for 932 yards, and tied his career high by scoring 7 touchdowns.

==== 1986 season: Career yardage record and retirement ====

Joiner signed another one-year contract, and entered the 1986 season only 128 receiving yards behind Don Maynard&#x27;s NFL record of 11,834 for a career. He turned 39 during the course of the season and was the second-oldest active player behind Jeff Van Note of the Atlanta Falcons, as well as the oldest wide receiver in league history.

He surpassed Maynard&#x27;s record of receiving yards in a week 5 away game against the Seattle Seahawks. The record-breaking catch was a 20-yarder from Fouts during the 3rd quarter of a 33–7 defeat; the game was halted briefly and Joiner got a standing ovation from the Seattle crowd. Joiner broke his right hand late in the season. In week 15, he was available to play in what would have been his final home game, but was kept on the sidelines by new head coach Al Saunders due to his injury. It was the first game he had missed since 1973 with the Bengals, and broke a 194-game regular season appearance streak. Joiner was disappointed, but said that the younger receivers had practiced all week for the game and it would have been unfair to them if he had played. Saunders expressed regret for not using him, saying that the Joiner&#x27;s streak and potential last home game did not cross his mind. Joiner did play the following week, ending his career with 3 catches for 25 yards in a 47–17 defeat at Cleveland.

Joiner finished the year with 34 catches, his least productive season since 1978, and retired from playing after the season. He said, &quot;I&#x27;d thought about it for about eight or nine years and I finally did it. I&#x27;m 39 and that&#x27;s too old to be playing football for a wide receiver. I&#x27;ve had a great career, I think, and I&#x27;m just proud of the fact that I finished No. 1, even though it probably won&#x27;t last that long.&quot;

Joiner was the last active player from the AFL. He finished his 18 AFL/NFL seasons with 750 receptions for 12,146 yards, averaging 16.2 average per catch, and 65 touchdowns. He caught 586 passes in 11 seasons with San Diego after totaling 164 in seven seasons with Houston and Cincinnati. Joiner had 50 or more catches in seven seasons, five with 60 or more, and three with at least 70 with the Chargers. He retired as the then-NFL leader in career receptions and receiving yards. At the time, he also played the most seasons (18) and games by a wide receiver (239). At age 39, Joiner also retired as the oldest wide receiver in NFL history. He credited his success and longevity to Coryell: &quot;Thanks to Coach Coryell’s offense and his revolutionary passing game, he prolonged my career, from the day I got to the Chargers until the day I retired. I will forever be grateful to him and what he did for the game of football.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Joiner excelled despite neither being among the quickest nor most talented receivers in the NFL. Throughout his career, he was overshadowed by more glamorous receiving mates, including LeVias and Ken Burrough in Houston, Curtis in Cincinnati, and Jefferson, Chandler, and Winslow with San Diego. In addition to good health and longevity, Joiner was an intelligent player and precise pass route runner, capable of changing direction without sacrificing speed due to a short stride and low centre of gravity. He had a tendency to fumble while with the Bengals, but fixed the problem and seldom fumbled while in San Diego. Joiner rarely ran deep routes, specialising in running inside patterns and making tough catches in traffic. He became aware early in his time in San Diego that he no longer had the sprinting speed of his youth, and compensated with an improved knowledge of defenses brought on by experience. Quiet and modest as an individual, Joiner was voted the Chargers&#x27; most inspirational player seven times by his teammates.
Hall of Fame coach Walsh called Joiner &quot;the most intelligent, the smartest, the most calculating receiver the game has ever known.&quot; Gibbs, his offensive coordinator in San Diego, praised Joiner as &quot;a totally dedicated guy who was just a great producer.&quot; &quot;Without question, he is the finest technician—running routes and reading coverages—in the National Football League&quot;, said Ernie Zampese, the Chargers&#x27; receiving coach. Bengals teammate Bob Trumpy praised Joiner&#x27;s work ethic, saying, &quot;You know why he&#x27;s caught all those balls? Because he&#x27;s busted his tail in every practice, on every play in practice. Whatever quarterback he&#x27;s been with has known that Charlie will be there, every time. He trusts Charlie.&quot; Joiner was Fouts&#x27; favorite receiver on third down. &quot;All I’m trying to do out there is look for a port in a storm. He’s the port. Having Charlie is like having a fail-safe button,&quot; said Fouts.

Joiner was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. He was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996, becoming the third Grambling player to be selected. In 1999, he was ranked No. 100 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 greatest football players, while a 2019 USA Today article ranked him as the ninth-best player in Chargers history. He was inducted into the Black College Football Hall of Fame in 2013. The Chargers inducted Joiner into their hall of fame in 1993 and retired his No. 18 in 2023.

== Coaching career ==
In 1987, Saunders hired Joiner as an assistant coach working with wide receivers. He was retained by the following head coach, Dan Henning, but Henning&#x27;s entire coaching staff were dismissed following the 1991 season, ending Joiner&#x27;s sixteen-year run with the team as a player and coach. He joined Marv Levy&#x27;s Buffalo Bills shortly afterwards, again serving as a wide receiver coach, then moved on to take the same role with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2001. Joiner stayed with the Chiefs for seven seasons before losing his job with them in 2008; he re-joined the Chargers three weeks later for his final stint working with their receivers. Joiner spent five more years in San Diego, then announced his retirement at the age of 65, saying football was &quot;definitely a young man&#x27;s game.&quot;

Joiner&#x27;s retirement ended a 44-year professional career, eighteen as a player and twenty-six as a position coach. Twenty-one of those years were spent with the Chargers.

== Life outside football ==

After leaving the Oilers, Joiner continued to live in Houston throughout the rest of his playing career, only moving to Rancho Bernardo in San Diego when he joined the Chargers&#x27; coaching staff. He has an accountancy degree from his time in college, and worked part time for Gulf Oil during the offseason for ten years. Joiner was unusual in not employing a sports agent, as his knowledge of finance allowed him to manage his own contract negotiations.

Joiner is married and has two daughters.

<doc id="1173887" wikidata="Q751348" url="?curid=1173887" title="Norwegian Wood (novel)">
<text>is a 1987 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami.
The novel is a nostalgic story of loss. It is told from the first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student living in Tokyo. Through Watanabe&#x27;s reminiscences, readers see him develop relationships with two very different women—the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori.

This novel is set in late-1960s Tokyo during a period when Japanese students, like those of many other nations, were protesting against the established order. While it serves as the backdrop against which the events of the novel unfold, Murakami (through the eyes of Watanabe and Midori) portrays the student movement as largely weak-willed and hypocritical. 

Murakami adapted the first section of the novel from an earlier short story, &quot;Firefly&quot;. The story was subsequently included in the collection &quot;Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman&quot;. 

&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was hugely popular with Japanese youth and made Murakami something of a superstar in his native country (apparently much to his dismay at the time). During the height of the popularity, Murakami would even leave Japan for a time.

A film adaptation with the same title was released in 2010, directed by Tran Anh Hung.

==Title==
The original Japanese title, &quot;Noruwei no Mori&quot;, is the standard Japanese translation of the title of the Beatles song &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;. This song is often described in the novel, and is the favorite song of the character Naoko. &quot;Mori&quot; in the Japanese title translates into English as &quot;wood&quot; in the sense of &quot;forest&quot;, not the material &quot;wood&quot;, even though the song lyrics refer to the latter. Forest settings and imagery are significant in the novel.

==Characters==
* – The protagonist and narrator. He is a Tokyo college student of average ability, majoring in drama without reason or conviction for doing so. Unlike most students, he is interested in Western, and in particular, American literature. He was Kizuki&#x27;s best friend, and develops romantic relationships with Naoko and, later, Midori.
* – A beautiful but emotionally fragile woman who was Kizuki&#x27;s girlfriend, but becomes involved with Watanabe after Kizuki&#x27;s death. Naoko&#x27;s older sister took her own life at age 17, which, along with Kizuki&#x27;s suicide, has a lasting effect on Naoko&#x27;s emotional stability and she resides in a psychiatric institution for most of the story.
* – A vivacious, outgoing, and provocative classmate of Watanabe. She and her sister help their absent father run a small bookstore after her mother&#x27;s death from brain cancer. She originally had a boyfriend but develops feelings for Watanabe as she gets to know him more, putting Watanabe in a tough situation.
* – A patient of the mountain asylum to which Naoko retreats. She and Naoko room together and become close friends. An accomplished pianist and guitarist, Reiko has endured lifelong mental problems that wrecked her professional musical career and later her marriage. She attempts to advise Watanabe and Naoko in their relationship.
* – Watanabe&#x27;s best friend in high school, and Naoko&#x27;s first boyfriend. Kizuki took his own life when he was 17, which has a lasting effect on both Watanabe and Naoko.
* – A diplomacy student at the elite University of Tokyo whose friendship with Watanabe is kindled over a shared love of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Nagasawa is unusually charismatic and complex in both his ideals and personal relationships. Watanabe routinely accompanies Nagasawa on outings to bars, where they pick up girls for one-night stands. Nagasawa never seems to feel much guilt over these transgressions other than admitting that his girlfriend, Hatsumi, deserves better.
* – The long-suffering girlfriend of Nagasawa. A kind woman by nature, she tries to offer advice to Watanabe, who is reluctant to confide in her or Nagasawa. Two years after Nagasawa leaves for Germany, Hatsumi marries, only to commit suicide after another two years. News of this prompts Watanabe to end his friendship with Nagasawa.
* – Watanabe&#x27;s dormitory roommate who is obsessed with cleanliness, and who is majoring in cartography in preparation for a career at the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan. His neurotic behavior is a source of annoyance and mockery among the others in the dormitory. He later moves out without warning, leaving their room entirely to Watanabe until he moves out of the dorm altogether.
* Itoh – An art student whom Watanabe meets after moving out of the dorm he shared with Nagasawa and Storm Trooper. The two share a love of Boris Vian. He has a girlfriend in his hometown of Nagasaki, but her unease about Itoh&#x27;s chosen career leads him to worry about their relationship.
* Momoko &quot;Momo&quot; Kobayashi – Midori&#x27;s elder sister.
*Mr. Kobayashi – Midori&#x27;s widowed father. Midori had initially said that he had emigrated to Uruguay, but that later turns out to be a lie; Mr. Kobayashi was actually in a hospital in Tokyo, with brain cancer. When Midori and Watanabe visit him, Watanabe briefly stays to take care of him alone. He later dies, and his daughters sell the bookstore to move elsewhere.

==Plot synopsis==
Thirty-seven-year-old Toru Watanabe is landing in Hamburg, West Germany, when he hears an orchestral cover of the Beatles song &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;. He is suddenly overwhelmed by feelings of loss and nostalgia. He thinks back to the 1960s, when so much happened that touched his life.

Watanabe, his classmate Kizuki, and Kizuki&#x27;s girlfriend Naoko are the best of friends. Kizuki and Naoko are particularly close and feel as if they are soulmates, and Watanabe seems more than happy to be their enforcer. This idyllic existence is shattered by the unexpected suicide of Kizuki on his 17th birthday. Kizuki&#x27;s death deeply touches both surviving friends; Watanabe feels the influence of death everywhere, while Naoko feels as if some integral part of her has been permanently lost. The two of them spend more and more time together going for long walks on Sundays, although feelings for each other are never clarified in this interval. On the night of Naoko&#x27;s 20th birthday, she feels especially vulnerable and they have sex, during which Watanabe realizes that she is a virgin. Afterward, Naoko leaves Watanabe a letter saying that she needs some time apart and is quitting college to go to a sanatorium.

These events are set against a backdrop of civil unrest. The students at Watanabe&#x27;s college go on strike and call for a revolution. Inexplicably, the students end their strike and act as if nothing had happened, which enrages Watanabe as a sign of hypocrisy.

Watanabe is befriended by a fellow drama classmate, Midori Kobayashi. She is everything that Naoko is not—outgoing, vivacious, and supremely self-confident. Despite his love for Naoko, Watanabe finds himself attracted to Midori as well. Midori reciprocates his feelings, and their friendship grows during Naoko&#x27;s absence. Watanabe and Midori share a special kind of relationship where both of them understand each other.

Watanabe visits Naoko at her secluded mountain sanatorium near Kyoto. There he meets Reiko Ishida, an older patient there who has become Naoko&#x27;s confidante. During this and subsequent visits, Reiko and Naoko reveal more about their past: Reiko talks about the cause of her collapse into mental illness and details the failure of her marriage, while Naoko talks about the unexpected suicide of her older sister several years ago.

When he returns to Tokyo, Watanabe is distracted by his continuing thoughts about Naoko, and unintentionally alienates Midori by moving to a suburb without telling her. He writes a letter to Reiko, asking for her advice about his conflicted affections for both Naoko and Midori. He does not want to hurt Naoko, but he does not want to lose Midori either. Reiko counsels him to seize this chance for happiness and see how his relationship with Midori turns out.

A later letter informs Watanabe that Naoko has killed herself. Watanabe, grieving and in a daze, wanders aimlessly around Japan, while Midori—with whom he has not kept in touch—wonders what has happened to him. After about a month of wandering, he returns to the Tokyo area and gets in contact with Reiko, who leaves the sanatorium to come to visit. Reiko stays with Watanabe, and they hold an informal memorial service for Naoko on his rooftop. Afterward, Reiko and Watanabe have sex. It is through this experience and the intimate conversation that Watanabe and Reiko share that night, that he comes to realize that Midori is the most important person in his life. After he sees Reiko off, Watanabe calls Midori to declare his love for her. Midori asks, &quot;Where are you now?&quot;, and the novel ends with Watanabe pondering that question.

==English translations==
&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; has been translated into English twice. The first translation was by Alfred Birnbaum, who translated several of Murakami&#x27;s earlier novels, and was published, in Japan only, in 1989 by Kodansha as part of the Kodansha English Library series. Like other books in this pocket-sized series, the English text was intended for Japanese students of English, and the book featured an appendix listing the Japanese text for key English phrases encountered in the novel. This edition kept the two-volume division of the original Japanese version and its color scheme, the first volume having a red cover, the second green (the first UK edition in 2000 also kept this division and appearance). This earlier translation has been discontinued in Japan.

The second translation, by Jay Rubin, is the authorized version for publication outside Japan and was first published in 2000 by Harvill Press in the UK, and Vintage International in the United States.

The two translations differ somewhat. There are differences in nicknames: Watanabe&#x27;s roommate, for example, is called &quot;Kamikaze&quot; in the Birnbaum translation, and &quot;Storm Trooper&quot; in the Rubin translation.

No English trade hardcover edition of the novel was published until October 2010, when an exclusive limited edition for Waterstones was released by Vintage Classics ().
==Reception==
Upon release, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was generally well received. Globally, the work was received generally well with &quot;Complete Review&quot; saying on the consensus &quot;Almost (but not quite) all are very enthusiastic.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation directed by Tran Anh Hung was released in Japan in 2010. The film stars Kenichi Matsuyama as Watanabe, Rinko Kikuchi as Naoko, and Kiko Mizuhara as Midori. It was presented at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. Jonny Greenwood wrote the score for the film.

Locations used in the film include the Tonomine highlands, Mineyama highlands and Kasumi coast.

<text>Everything in Time (B-sides, Rarities, Remixes) is a compilation album comprising B-sides, remixes, and rare songs by the American third wave ska band No Doubt, first released on November 23, 2003 as disc three of No Doubt&#x27;s box set, &quot;Boom Box&quot;, which also contained &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, &quot;The Videos 1992–2003&quot; and &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot;. &quot;Everything in Time&quot; was later released separately on October 12, 2004.

The album&#x27;s B-sides and rarities originate in recording sessions for the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. The first six tracks were used as B-sides for three of the singles released off the album, &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and &quot;Bathwater&quot;. &quot;Everything in Time&quot; also includes a remix of the song &quot;New&quot;, also from &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, and two remixes of &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, the title track from No Doubt&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;.

The album received little coverage, not being a studio album, although the publications that did cover it gave average or good reviews, both in the box set &quot;Boom Box&quot; and it is in solo release. It charted on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart at number 182.

== Background ==
No Doubt&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; was recorded between 1998 and 1999 and released on April 11, 2000. Over 40 demo tracks were recorded for &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, but the list was whittled down to the fourteen for the album&#x27;s final composition, four of which were released as singles: &quot;New&quot;, &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and &quot;Bathwater&quot;. No Doubt released their fifth studio album, &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, in December 2001 and from it released four singles, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;, &quot;Hella Good&quot;, &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and &quot;Running&quot; between 2001 and 2003. The album sold 3 million copies and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Later, in April 2003, No Doubt went into hiatus to take a break to spend time with their families before starting to compile &quot;Everything in Time&quot;; &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, a greatest hits album featuring songs from their previous studio albums; and &quot;Boom Box&quot;, a box set compiling &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;, &quot;Everything in Time&quot;, &quot;The Videos 1992–2003&quot; and &quot;Live in the Tragic Kingdom&quot;, which would all be released on the same date. The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: &quot;Love. Angel. Music. Baby.&quot; on November 22, 2004 and &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; on December 4, 2006.

== Music ==
The first six tracks on the album are B-sides from No Doubt&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. &quot;Big Distraction&quot; is a B-side to the British CD single release of &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot; and appears on the Australian and Japanese versions of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. &quot;Leftovers&quot; is a B-side to the European enhanced and Australian CD single releases of &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot;. &quot;Full Circle&quot; is a B-side to the European, European enhanced, and Australian CD single releases of &quot;Ex-Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and appears on the Japanese version of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. &quot;Cellophane Boy&quot; is a B-side to the CD single release of &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot;. &quot;Beauty Contest&quot; is a B-side to the British and German CD single releases of &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and &quot;Bathwater&quot;. &quot;Under Construction&quot; is a B-side to the British CD single releases of &quot;Simple Kind of Life&quot; and &quot;Bathwater&quot;.

&quot;Everything in Time&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re So Foxy&quot;, and &quot;Panic&quot; are outtakes from recording sessions of &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;, while &quot;New Friend&quot; is a leftover from the &quot;Rock Steady&quot; recordings. &quot;Sailin&#x27; On&quot; is a cover of the song by Bad Brains, an American hardcore punk band, from their debut album &quot;Bad Brains&quot;. &quot;Oi to the World&quot; is a cover of the original version by The Vandals, a Californian punk rock band, from their album &quot;Oi to the World!&quot;.
&quot;I Throw My Toys Around&quot; is a song from the soundtrack of &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, performed by No Doubt and Elvis Costello.

&quot;New and Approved&quot; is a remix of the song &quot;New&quot; from &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;. It was a B-side to many of the single releases of &quot;New&quot;. &quot;A Real Love Survives&quot; and &quot;A Rock Steady Vibe&quot; are remixes of the song &quot;Rock Steady&quot; on the album &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. &quot;A Real Love Survives&quot; features British rapper Ms. Dynamite and &quot;A Rock Steady Vibe&quot; features Sweetie Irie.

== Critical reception ==

In its 2003 release as part of &quot;Boom Box&quot;, &quot;Everything in Time&quot; was described as &quot;certainly worth having&quot; by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic in a review for the box set. RockMusicReview called the song &quot;Full Circle&quot;, from &quot;Everything in Time&quot;, one of the highlights of &quot;Boom Box&quot;. In its 2004 solo release, few critics reviewed &quot;Everything in Time&quot; because it was not a studio album. However, Laura Sinagra for &quot;Blender&quot; magazine gave it three stars out of five, saying it contained &quot;endearing, younger examples of the marriage-minded tomboy [Gwen Stefani] agonizing over the task of taming restless playboys&quot;. She complimented &quot;New Friend&quot;, &quot;Under Construction&quot; and both versions of &quot;Everything in Time&quot; as &quot;satisfying laments&quot; with &quot;truth-serum lyrics&quot;, and praised Stefani&#x27;s &quot;just-a-girl sass&quot; in &quot;Oi to the World&quot;. However, she criticized &quot;Big Distraction&quot; and &quot;Leftovers&quot;, which in her opinion were &quot;pale beside the singles [&quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;]&quot;. Both Allmusic and Artistdirect gave the album three stars out of five but neither gave an actual review.

<text>ComputerLand was a widespread chain of retail computer stores during the early years of the microcomputer revolution, and was one of the outlets (along with Computer City and Sears) chosen to introduce the IBM PC in 1981. The first ComputerLand opened in 1976, and the chain eventually included about 800 stores by 1985. After this time the rapid commoditization of the PC led to the company&#x27;s downfall, with most of the retail locations closing by 1990. The company officially ended in February 1999.

==History==

ComputerLand was founded by William H. Millard. In 1974 he launched a company, IMS Associates, Inc., to build what was claimed to be the first truly integrated personal computers, sold as kits to hobbyists and the rapidly growing numbers of retailers (through small ads in &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;). The computer, the IMSAI 8080, may not have made Millard&#x27;s fortune, but his resulting experiences with the inexperienced and under‑capitalized retailers did. In 1976 (at the same time as the Byte Shop was selling its first few Apple II computers) he asked his Sales Director, Ed Faber (an ex‑IBM Manager), to start a new franchise operation, soon to become ComputerLand.

Faber first designed a pilot store, at Hayward, California, with the then-revolutionary concept of providing a &quot;full service&quot; store, offering under one roof all that the customer needed to support their PCs. The original name, Computer Shack, changed after opposition from Radio Shack. The renamed ComputerLand began franchising. The first franchisee was in Morristown, New Jersey, and was rapidly followed by a chain across the US.

It set a pattern that dominated PC retailing for the next decade. By the time IBM arrived on the scene, the network of branches, all run by franchisees, had grown to 190 in number. By the end of 1985, when Millard retired, there were some 800 branches (including some 200 outside the US) and he had become one of the computer billionaires.

Most ComputerLand stores succumbed to the predation of the &quot;box-shifters&quot; in the price wars of the latter 1980s, after the peak had passed. In 1987, Millard sold ComputerLand to E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co. for US$200 million.

In 1993, Merisel, a competitor company, announced it would purchase the ComputerLand name and all franchise holdings and its Datago aggregation division for $110 million. The new Merisel ComputerLand unit was operated by the then-president of Computerland&#x27;s franchise and distribution business, Martin Wolf. The following year, &quot;Vanstar&quot; was selected as the name for the ComputerLand corporate company-owned stores stemming from the Nynex acquisition. (Pleasanton, California) after the sale of split-off franchisor to Merisel.

In 1997 Synnex Information Technologies, a national distributor of microcomputers and communication, networking, peripheral and storage products, purchased substantially all the assets of Merisel FAB Inc., including the ComputerLand franchise. Synnex created ComputerLand Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Synnex, consisting of the ComputerLand and Datago businesses.

On October 9, 1998, Inacom purchased Vanstar for a reported $465 – $480 million. The resulting company employed nearly 12,000 and was estimated to generate $7 billion in revenue.
The acquisition of Vanstar reportedly added a large amount of debt, and it has been said that Inacom overpaid for a company of that size. Vanstar had 43.26 million shares outstanding at the time the deal was struck, and shareholders of Vanstar received .64 shares of ICO for each VST share in a stock swap deal, thus the issuance of 27.7 M shares of stock effectively more than doubled the number of outstanding shares while also being dilutive to the existing shares. This, plus debt concerns, led to a decline in the price of Inacom&#x27;s stock.

Inacom Corporation ceased operations completely in 2000.
Although the corporate ComputerLand ceased operations [VanStar], many former franchises continue to operate today as independently owned computer businesses under the ComputerLand name.

<text>Broadmead is a street in Bristol city centre in England, which has given its name to the principal shopping district of the city. It is part of Bristol Shopping Quarter.

== History ==

The name of the street was first recorded in 1383 as &quot;Brodemede&quot;. The name either means &quot;broad meadow&quot; or refers to &quot;brodemedes&quot;, a type of woollen cloth woven only in Bristol.

The area lay just to the north of the town walls of the historic Bristol. In about 1227 Blackfriars was founded as a Dominican priory in the area. After the dissolution of the monasteries the site had various secular uses, and in 1749 became the location of a Quaker meeting house, now known as Quakers Friars. In 1671 local dissenters opened the Broadmead Baptist Chapel near the junction of Broadmead and Union Street. In 1739 John Wesley built his Methodist chapel, known as the New Room, in the street. Shops were also built in the area. In 1825 a covered arcade was built between Horsefair and Broadmead, which still survives and is the second oldest building in Broadmead. Originally accompanied by another section, the Upper Arcade, but that was destroyed by 1940 bombing. St James&#x27; Priory, founded 1129, is northwest of Broadmead and Castle Park, the site of the Norman Bristol Castle, is to the south.

When the old shopping district of Castle Street and Wine Street was heavily damaged in the Bristol Blitz, it was decided to redevelop the Broadmead area as the main shopping district of the city. Rebuilding began in 1950. The existing street, which ran between Union Street and Merchant Street, was extended north to include the former Rosemary Street. Like most 1950s buildings in Britain, affordable and architecturally uninteresting utilitarian buildings form the bulk of the Broadmead area. In the 1980s some of these were removed to make way for the Galleries shopping centre, which is a three level covered street. Broadmead and several of the surrounding streets were pedestrianised.

== Broadmead today ==

A regeneration project for Broadmead finished about 2010. The shopping area has been extended over the central ring road to produce a new shopping centre, Cabot Circus, which opened in September 2008. This area had been named Merchants Quarter but in April 2006 the name was abandoned after a campaign claiming the name was offensive because it was the Bristol Merchant Venturers who dealt in the trade of African slaves.

In 1987, the shopping centre was the scene of an abduction that received national attention. On 8 October 1987, 29-year-old newly-wed Shirley Banks was abducted by serial killer John Cannan as she walked back to her car. Her body was found on Easter Day 1988. Cannan was convicted of her abduction and murder.

A business improvement district (BID) was established for Broadmead in 2005, with a current plan that extends to 2028.

In 2021, flagship shop Debenhams closed following the chain&#x27;s bankruptcy, and the closure of the Marks &amp; Spencer branch was announced for January 2022.

==Public Transport==
Broadmead is served by various bus services and is immediately south of Bristol bus station. Bristol Temple Meads station is about half a mile south east.

<text>Paul Underwood Kellogg (September 30, 1879 – November 1, 1958) was an American journalist and social reformer. He died at 79 in New York on November 1, 1958.

==Life==
He was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, in 1879. After working as a journalist he moved to New York City to study at Columbia University.

==Journalist==
After university Kellogg worked for &quot;Charities&quot; magazine before carrying out an unprecedented, in-depth study of industrial life in Pittsburgh. Published as &quot;The Pittsburgh Survey&quot; (1910–14), it became a model for sociologists wishing to employ research to aid social reform. His studies which helped to abolish the seven-day work week.

Kellogg returned to &quot;Charities&quot; magazine, now retitled &quot;Survey&quot; magazine. He became editor in 1912 and over the next few years turned into America&#x27;s leading social work journal.

==Activist==

An opponent of U.S. involvement in the First World War, Kellogg joined Jane Addams and Oswald Garrison Villard, to persuade Henry Ford, the American industrialist, to organize a peace conference in Stockholm. Ford came up with the idea of sending a boat of pacifists to Europe to determine if they could negotiate an agreement to end the war. He chartered the ship &quot;Oskar II&quot;, and it sailed from Hoboken, New Jersey, on December 4, 1915. The Ford Peace Ship reached Stockholm in January, 1916, and a conference was organized with representatives from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United States.

In 1918, Kellogg became the chairman of the Foreign Policy Association in New York. By the 1920s, Kellogg had become appalled by the way people were being persecuted for their political beliefs, particularly by President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s appointee A. Mitchell Palmer. In 1920, Kellogg joined with Roger Baldwin, Norman Thomas, Crystal Eastman, Addams, Clarence Darrow, John Dewey, Abraham Muste, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Upton Sinclair to form the American Civil Liberties Union.

In 1927, Kellogg joined with John Dos Passos, Alice Hamilton, Addams, Upton Sinclair, Dorothy Parker, Ben Shahn, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Floyd Dell, George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells in an effort to prevent the execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. Although Webster Thayer, the original judge, was officially criticized for his conduct at the trial, the execution took place on August 23, 1927.

<doc id="1173921" wikidata="Q6310824" url="?curid=1173921" title="Jumble">
<text>Jumble is a word puzzle with a clue, a drawing illustrating the clue, and a set of words, each of which is “jumbled” by scrambling its letters. A solver reconstructs the words, and then arranges letters at marked positions in the words to spell the answer phrase to the clue. The clue, and sometimes the illustration, provide hints about the answer phrase, which frequently uses a homophone or pun.

Jumble was created in 1954 by Martin Naydel, who was better known for his work on comic books. It originally appeared under the title &quot;Scramble.&quot; Henri Arnold and Bob Lee took over the feature in 1962 and continued it for at least 30 years. As of 2013, Jumble was being maintained by David L. Hoyt and Jeff Knurek. Jumble is one of the most valuable properties of its distributor, US company Tribune Content Agency, which owns the JUMBLE trademarks and copyrights. Daily and Sunday Jumble puzzles appear in over 600 newspapers in the United States and internationally.

The current syndicated version found in most daily newspapers (under the official title &quot;Jumble--That Scrambled Word Game&quot;) has four base anagrams, two of five letters and two of six, followed by a clue and a series of blank spaces into which the answer to the clue fits. The answer to the clue is generally a pun of some sort. A weekly &quot;kids version&quot; of the puzzle features a three-letter word plus three four-letter words. In order to find the letters that are in the answer to the given clue, the player must unscramble all four of the scrambled words; the letters that are in the clue will be circled. The contestant then unscrambles the circled letters to form the answer to the clue. An alternate workaround is to solve some of the scrambled words, figure out the answer to the clue without all the letters, then use the &quot;extra&quot; letters as aids to solve the remaining scrambled words.

There are many variations of puzzles from the Jumble brand including Jumble, Jumble for Kids, Jumble Crosswords, TV Jumble, Jumble BrainBusters, Jumble BrainBusters Junior, Hollywood Jumble, Jumble Jong, Jumble Word Vault, Jumpin&#x27; Jumble, Jumble Solitaire, and Jumble Word Web.

==Versions in other media==

In addition to being playable online through various interactive online platforms such as on Tribune Content Agency&#x27;s Web site in an HTML 5 implementation, Jumble is downloadable through several mobile game applications such as Apple&#x27;s iTunes, AT&amp;T and on the Amazon Kindle.

In 2010, Jumble Madness was developed by Anino Entertainment and published by Destineer for the Nintendo DS.

As of 2012, Jumble books were published by Andrews McMeel Publishing, Triumph Books, and Tyndale House Publishers.

Jumble is also available as a Bicycle playing card by United States Playing Card Company with an assortment of game titles such as &quot;3-4-5,&quot; &quot;Jumble Word Meld,&quot; and &quot;Jumble Solitaire.&quot;

A TV show based on Jumble aired in 1994. It was hosted by game show veteran Wink Martindale, and aired on The Family Channel (now called Freeform).

==Computerized solutions==
Algorithms have been designed to solve Jumbles, using a dictionary. Common algorithms work by printing all words that can be formed from a set of letters. The solver then chooses the right word. A dictionary of such anagrams may be used to solve puzzles or verify that a jumbled word is unique when creating puzzles.

First algorithm:

# Begin
# Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s)
# Sort the letters of J in alphabetical order, preserving duplicates
# Look up sorted letters in a hash table, initialised with a dictionary, that maps a sorted set of letters to unscrambled words
# Print the set of words, which is W
# End

Second algorithm:

#Begin
#Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s)
#Frame a word list Y with all permutations of J
#For each word in Y check if the word is existing in the dictionary
#If a match is found then collect it in word list W
#Print the words in W
# End

Algorithm to find the permutations of J:

#Begin 
#Initialize a string with first character of J denoted by J(1)
#Add the second character of J denoted by J(2) on either side of J(1) to get two strings
#*J(1)J(2)
#*J(2)J(1)
#Add the third character of J denoted by J(3) on either side and in between the above 2 strings to get 6 strings
#*J(1)J(2)J(3)
#*J(1)J(3)J(2)
#*J(3)J(1)J(2)
#*J(2)J(1)J(3)
#*J(2)J(3)J(1)
#*J(3)J(2)J(1)
#In the same way add J(4) to each of the above strings in either sides and between two characters to get 24 strings
#Continue this until all the characters are completed

Douglas Hofstadter developed a program called Jumbo that tries to solve Jumble problems as a human mind would.
The program does not rely on a dictionary and does not try to find real English words, but rather words that could be English, exploiting a database of plausibilities for various combinations of letters.
Letters are combined non-deterministically, following a strategy inspired by chemical reactions and free associations.

<text>Fischbach-Göslikon is a municipality in the district of Bremgarten in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.
==History==
While several, individual mesolithic items have been found in the municipality, the first evidence of a settlement are two Hallstatt era graves. The current village was founded in the Middle Ages. The medieval settlements of Fischbach and Göslikon are first mentioned in the first half of the 12th century as &quot;Visbach und Fischbach&quot;. In 1159 it was mentioned as &quot;Cohelinchon&quot;, and in 1179 as &quot;Cozlinchon&quot;. The high and low justice lay with the Habsburgs, and then after 1415 with the Swiss. The monasteries of Hermetschwil and Gnadental as well as citizens and institutions of Bremgarten held property in both villages.

The parish church was consecrated in 1048 and at least from 1159, it was in possession of Muri Abbey. In 1360 it came under the authority of the &quot;Spital Baden&quot;. Between 1529-31 the Protestant Reformation entered Fischbach-Göslikon, though today more of the population remains Roman Catholic. In 1671-72, a new church was built and in 1757-60 it was rebuilt in the Rococo style. In 1709 a new chapel was built next to the church.

In 1798 Fischbach and Göslikon were combined, though the Ortsbürger communities remained separate until 1997.

In the 19th Century a peat processing operation opened in the village. Around the same time, a significant factory for straw plaiting opened. The factory had 71 employees in 1863, and added 12 more by 1885 (at the time the combined villages only had about 500 inhabitants). A gravel plant opened along the banks of the Reuss. The Reuss River Corrections of 1811-18, 1906–15 and 1935–50 changed the landscape and settlement pattern of Fischbach-Göslikon.

<doc id="1173931" wikidata="Q1658023" url="?curid=1173931" title="Ijebu Kingdom">
<text>Ijebu (also known as Jebu, Geebu, or Xabu ) was a Yoruba kingdom in South West Nigeria. It was formed around the fifteenth century. According to legend, its ruling dynasty was founded by Obanta whose personal name was Ogborogan of Ile-Ife. Its contemporary successor is one of the country&#x27;s traditional states.

== Early history ==
The Ijebu Kingdom is estimated to be one of the earliest kingdoms founded in West Africa. Ijebu-Ode was originally a city founded by a leader from Ife, like most other early states in the Yoruba region. They began to build a series of walls and ditches around the city, construction of these walls began in 800–1000 AD. These walls would be known as Sungbo&#x27;s Eredo. The walls extended to eventually cover the entirety of the Ijebu kingdom. The walls measured an estimated 3.5 million cubic meters of moved earth and sand and they are among the largest man-made earthen structures in Africa&quot;, for reference it used one million cubic metres more than the amount of rock and earth used in the Great Pyramid at Giza. The evidence found is not linked to an isolated town but to a kingdom&#x27;s large dike, a kingdom which was once functional and had at its disposal a high level of agricultural practice, an established pottery-making tradition, and possibly an army that triggered the construction of the Eredo.

Further archeological works show the advancement of the Ijebu kingdom. The palatial grounds of the capital, Ijebu-Ode were shown to have the floors paved with ceramic like material. People at the palace also seemed to practice astronomy, with triangular pavements facing a true eastern direction; the extreme alignments to the movement of the sun from one solar solstice to the other worked as a sundial.

Europeans also had a first hand account of Ijebu and wrote about it. Portuguese sailors and traders on the West African coast encountered the Ijebu kingdom first in which they called Geebu in the 1508 writing: 

Ijebu was mentioned again, this time called Xabu by a Portuguese trader in 1620:

==Later history==
The kingdom was one of the most developed in the region with a complex and highly organized government. The capital is at Ijebu Ode where the Awujale has his palace. Counterbalancing the Awujale is the Osugbo (known as the Ogboni in other parts of Nigeria), a council of all free born, titled men that acted as the kingdom&#x27;s courts. The Osugbo is divided into six groups based on rank, the highest being the iwarefa, whose head the Oliwa was the second most powerful figure in the nation. Also powerful is the Olisa, who could be described as the mayor of Ijebu Ode. The Kingdom was made up of several towns and stretches to parts of Lagos State and borders Ondo State.

The state rose in power in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, mainly due to its important position on the trade routes between Lagos and Ibadan. The kingdom imposed sharp limits on trade, insisting that all trade through the region be conducted by Ijebu merchants. The monopoly brought great wealth to the kingdom, but also annoyed the Europeans.

In 1892, the British Empire declared war on the Ijebu kingdom in response to its barriers on trade. The British emerged victorious in the conflict and captured the Ijebu capital, burning the meeting hall of the Osugbo. As noted by colonial governor Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard, the British made efficient use of the Maxim gun during the conflict; when Lugard defended himself in response to criticism of the high casualties rates caused by Maxim guns employed by troops under his command during military campaigns in the Uganda Protectorate, he stated: &quot;On the West Coast, in the &#x27;Jebu&#x27; war, undertaken by Government, I have been told &#x27;several thousands&#x27; were mowed down by the Maxim.&quot;

After British colonization, the capital served as an administrative center for colonial officials as the kingdom was annexed to the colony of Southern Nigeria. Today, it constitutes one of the traditional states of Nigeria.

The Ijebu kingdom is governed by a king and his group of titled elders, who usually are men of a higher status and of considerable influence. The council governed the region and had representatives of further devolved councils who no longer have any power. Since the invasion of Lord Lugard, these councils have continued to meet and advise the Obanta kings, their power, however, is largely ceremonial since the establishment of the colonial administration in their protectorate. The elders were known to represent their various villages and the will of the people, and are now not such a significant part in the ceremonial process. The elders were all given individual titles and the lead elder was given the title prince, although he was only ever to inherit the kingship in special circumstances. The traditional belief that governed the monarchy was similar to that of the Chinese Mandate of Heaven.

<text>Davenport University is a private university with campuses throughout Michigan and online. It was founded in 1866 by Conrad Swensburg and currently offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, and master&#x27;s degrees; diplomas; and post-grad certification programs in business, technology, health professions, and graduate studies (MBA).

Davenport&#x27;s W.A. Lettinga Main Campus is in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The main campus includes student organizations, residence halls, and athletic programs.

== History ==
The predecessor to the modern Davenport University was founded in 1866 by Conrad G. Swensburg, a Union Army Veteran who returned to Michigan from the Civil War. The college, located in downtown Grand Rapids, opened with sixteen students as the Grand Rapids Business College on January 25, 1866. The college offered courses in various office skills, such as bookkeeping, penmanship, business law, and arithmetic.

The college operated under various names and in several locations in Grand Rapids throughout its early history. By 1910 the college was on the verge of closing. Michael E. Davenport, a new teacher at the school, reinvigorated the remaining staff and eventually took over the school&#x27;s leadership in an attempt to revive it.

The school gained accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission—North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1976 and grew rapidly during the mid- to late 1900s and expanded with campus locations across Michigan.

== Campus ==
Davenport University&#x27;s W.A. Lettinga Main Campus is located in Grand Rapids. The campus contains three academic buildings, a field house/student activities center, two suite-style residence halls, and one traditional-style residence hall with a full cafeteria.

The Richard M. DeVos and Jay Van Andel Academic Center is the main academic building on the campus. The building was complete in 2005 at the cost of $23 million. It includes classroom and technology space and was constructed to look like a large office building in concert with Davenport University&#x27;s focus on business, technology, and health degrees. The facility includes academic advising, career services, and university offices, the campus bookstore and spirit shop, a café and dining location, the Margaret D. Sneden Library.

The Robert W. Sneden Center, completed in 2010, is an $8.5 million academic and arts extension connecting to the existing DeVos and Van Andel Academic Center. The extension features additional classroom and technology space, faculty office space, and a modern 220-seat auditorium.

The Donald W. Maine Business Building is a business building designed to incorporate multi-media technology. The Donald W. Maine College of Business building will be more than 60,000 square feet. A new Entrepreneurial Center will provide individuals seeking to start and grow businesses in West Michigan opportunities to consult with professionals at each stage in the process.

The Student Center opened in 2008 and became the fourth LEED certified building on the main DU campus. The facility houses meeting rooms, student social areas, Student Life Office, Student Center Café, a third on-campus dining area, fitness center with indoor rock climbing wall and suspended running track, and indoor basketball and volleyball court. The Field House is connected to the Student Center and is a 1,500-seat arena that serves as the home for DU Panthers men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s volleyball teams.

Beginning with the 2017–18 academic year, Davenport is a member of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC) and NCAA Division II. In addition to national team championships in competitive cheer, hockey, lacrosse, rugby and soccer, plus individual championships in track &amp; field, Davenport&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams include baseball, basketball, cross country, dance, football, golf, softball, tennis, volleyball and wrestling.

=== Residence halls ===
In recent years DU has undergone a transition from a commuter and online business school to include characteristics of a traditional university. The school has increased its athletic program, athletic facilities, and student life facilities. Davenport currently has three residence halls on the main campus, with an off-campus apartment complex.

Peter C. and Pat Cook Residence Hall or Cook Hall was the first residence hall constructed on campus; it is a four-story apartment-living style residence hall named for long-time donors Peter and Pat Cook. Fred and Lena Meijer Residence Hall is a five-story residence hall on the DU campus, and offers apartment-living style rooms for on campus students much like Cook Hall. South Residence Hall is a four-story residence halls that offers traditional dorm-style living. South Hall is the residence hall for freshman students living on campus. The hall also includes a large dining area. One off-campus apartment complex is called Panther Woods, and features four buildings. The other off-campus apartment complex is called Panther Ridge and features three buildings.

===Farmers Insurance Athletic Complex===
Built near the W.A. Lettinga Main Campus, Davenport University&#x27;s Farmers Insurance Athletic Complex was dedicated in March 2013. It features home fields for the school&#x27;s baseball and softball programs as well as eight courts for the school&#x27;s tennis programs. In 2016, Davenport finished building an outdoor facility hosting a new football stadium, soccer field, and nine-lane track and field complex. Along with this facility came an athletic support building housing new athletic offices, training room, locker rooms, and weight room.

=== Regional campuses ===
In addition to the main campus, Davenport University offers classes at other locations throughout Michigan including a Corporate Campus in Grand Rapids; institutional campuses in Lansing, Midland, and Warren; as well as University Center locations at Kalamazoo Valley Community College (Kalamazoo), Northwestern Michigan College (Traverse City), Wayne Community College (Detroit), and Macomb Community College (Clinton Township).

== Academics ==
The university offers more than 50 areas of study and confers associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees through its five colleges at its main campus, extension locations and online:
* The College of Arts and Sciences
* The College of Health Professions
* The College of Technology
* The College of Urban Education

<doc id="1173948" wikidata="Q573342" url="?curid=1173948" title="Wishing well">
<text>A wishing well is a term from European folklore to describe wells where it was thought that any spoken wish would be granted. The idea that a wish would be granted came from the notion that water housed deities or had been placed there as a gift from the gods. This practice is thought to have arisen because water is a source of life, and was often a scarce commodity.

== History ==
=== Germanic and Celtic traditions ===
The Germanic and Celtic peoples considered springs and wells sacred places. Sometimes the places were marked with wooden statues possibly of the god associated with the pool. Germanic peoples were known to throw the armour and weapons of defeated enemies into bogs and other pools of water as offerings to their gods.
As water is necessary for life, wells became popular places not only to get life sustaining water, but also as a social area. This has now related to town centers having wells in the center of them. Water was also seen to have healing powers, and wells became popular, with many people drinking the water, bathing in it, or simply wishing over it. Some people believed that the guardians or dwellers of the well would grant them their wish if they paid a price.

After uttering the wish, one would generally drop coins in the well. The wish would then be granted by the guardian or dweller, based upon how the coin would land at the bottom of the well. If the coin landed heads up, the guardian of the well would grant the wish, but the wish of a tails up coin would be ignored. It was thus potentially lucky to throw coins in the well, but it depended on how they landed.

Since 2021, excavation of an ancient wooden wishing well has been underway in what is now the town of Germering, Bavaria, Germany. More than 13,500 artifacts have been found, dating from the Bronze Age to the early Middle Ages.

The Celtic clootie well tradition and the English well dressing tradition appear to be related to this kind of ancient well veneration. The tradition of dropping pennies in ponds and fountains also stems from this. Coins would be placed there as gifts for the deity to show appreciation.

=== Nordic myths ===
The belief that deities inhabited wells in Germanic and Celtic traditions (explained above) may be a leftover from ancient mythology such as Mímir&#x27;s Well from Nordic myths, also known as the &quot;Well of Wisdom&quot;, a well that could grant the wisher infinite wisdom provided they sacrificed something they held dear. Odin was asked to sacrifice his right eye which he threw into the well to receive not only the wisdom of seeing the future but the understanding of why things must be. Mímir is the Nordic god of wisdom, and his well sits at the roots of Yggdrasil, the World Tree which draws its water from the well.

=== Oligodynamic effect ===
Another theory is that people may have unknowingly discovered the biocidal properties of both copper and silver; the two metals traditionally used in coins. Throwing coins made of either of these metals could help make the water safer to drink. Wells that were frequented by those that threw coins in may have been less affected by a range of bacterial infections making them seem more fortunate and may have even appeared to have cured people suffering from repeated infections.

== Extent ==
In November 2006 the &quot;Fountain Money Mountain&quot; reported that tourists throw just under 3 million pounds sterling per year into wishing wells.

<doc id="1173964" wikidata="Q7828166" url="?curid=1173964" title="Totalitarian principle">
<text>In quantum mechanics, the totalitarian principle states: &quot;Everything not forbidden is compulsory.&quot; Physicists including Murray Gell-Mann borrowed this expression, and its satirical reference to totalitarianism, from the popular culture of the early twentieth century.

The statement refers to a surprising feature of particle interactions: that any interaction that is not forbidden by a small number of simple conservation laws is not only allowed, but &quot;must&quot; be included in the sum over all &quot;paths&quot; that contribute to the outcome of the interaction. Hence if it is not forbidden, there is some probability amplitude for it to happen.

In the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, the principle has a more literal meaning: that every possibility at every interaction that is not forbidden by such a conservation law will actually happen (in some branch of the wave function).

==Origin of the phrase==
Neither the phrase nor its application to quantum physics originated with Gell-Mann, but a 1956 paper by him contains the first published use of the phrase as a description of quantum physics. Gell-Mann used it to describe the state of particle physics around the time he was formulating the Eightfold Way, a precursor to the quark-model of hadrons. According to the second edition of &quot;Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann &amp; the Revolution in Physics&quot; Gell-Mann incorrectly attributed the quote to George Orwell in a letter to the astrophysicist Jeremiah
Ostriker.

Formulations close to Gell-Mann&#x27;s are used in T. H. White&#x27;s 1958 (not 1938–39) version of &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;, Jack Parsons&#x27;s 1948 essay &quot;Freedom is a Two-Edged Sword&quot;, and Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1940 short story &quot;Coventry&quot;. They differ in details such as the order of the words &quot;forbidden&quot; and &quot;compulsory&quot;, and Gell-Mann&#x27;s footnote uses the words in both orders, although only one of these orders captures his precise logical meaning. The phrase, and variations on it, appear to have been common in this period, and probably trace back to an older legal principle, that everything which is not forbidden is allowed. Since White did not use the phrase in any published work until two years after Gell-Mann&#x27;s paper, White cannot have been Gell-Mann&#x27;s source. It is likely that writers such as White, Heinlein, and Gell-Mann were all simply making use of a phrase that was a part of popular culture at the time.

<doc id="1173968" wikidata="Q705235" url="?curid=1173968" title="Nicholas, Prince of Montenegro (born 1944)">
<text>Nicholas, Prince of Montenegro (; ; born 7 July 1944) is a French-born architect and the Head of the House of Petrović-Njegoš, which reigned over Montenegro from 1696 to 1766 and again from 1782 to 1918.

He lives in Montenegro and occupies part of the former royal palace and the historic family home in Njeguši. In 2011 the country recognised an official role for the Royal House of Petrović-Njegoš: to promote Montenegrin identity, culture, and traditions through cultural, humanitarian and other non-political activities.

==Family background==
The house of Petrović came originally from Herzegovina and settled in Njeguši around 1400. Niegosch was born around 1425 and became the Voivode of Njegoš.

Nicholas descends from Danilo Petrović-Njegoš who obtained the hereditary Dignity of Vladika (Prince-Bishop) of Montenegro in 1711 when it became a theocracy. Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš was recognized as Sovereign Prince of Montenegro by Russia on 21 March 1852, and established succession by male primogeniture. His successor, Prince Nikola I assumed the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; on 19 December 1900, and the title of King 28 August 1910.

Nicholas is also related to the former royal House of Obrenović through Jevrem, younger brother of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia.

During World War I the Petrović Njegoš family were forced to flee the country in 1915 after the Army of Montenegro was overwhelmed by the troops of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At the end of the war, territories of Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbia, while the Podgorica People&#x27;s Assembly abolished the Kingdom of Montenegro and deposing the Petrović Njegoš dynasty.

The family gained the French citizenship as they made their home in France where Nikola I of Montenegro died in exile in 1921. The same year, King Nikola&#x27;s maternal grandson, Alexandar Karađorđević (Prince Nikola I&#x27;s cousin) became king of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, of which Montenegro had become a part. Though the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was proclaimed on 13 November 1918, it was never recognized by Nikola I, who maintained a government-in-exile, which was headed by the ex-king&#x27;s former aide-de-camp and ambassador to Washington, General Anto Gvozdenović, until the Conference of Ambassadors at Paris gave international recognition to the union 13 July 1922.

Nicholas I&#x27;s heir at death was his eldest son, Crown Prince Danilo (titular King Danilo II), who &quot;abdicated&quot; after one week, recognizing his cousin&#x27;s reign over Serbia (including the territories of Montenegro) and Yugoslavia. The family&#x27;s dynastic claim was taken up by Nicholas I&#x27;s grandson, Michael, Prince of Montenegro, the titular King Mihajlo I, who was the father of Prince Nikola II and died in exile in 1986.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in Saint-Nicolas-du-Pélem at the house of a maternal great aunt in France as the only son and heir of Michael, Prince of Montenegro and his wife Geneviève, Princess of Montenegro, née Prigent (1919–1990), a member of the French resistance. Prince Michael was internationally recognised as Montenegro&#x27;s king-in-exile under a regency headed by his grandmother Queen Milena from 7 March 1921 until 13 July 1922 when international recognition was given for the 1918 annexation of Montenegro by the new Serbian headed kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Prince Nicholas&#x27; parents were married on 27 January 1941 in Paris.

Nicholas was initially baptised Catholic by his mother before his father had him re-baptised Orthodox. Nicholas has stated he feels close to both religions. His parents divorced in Paris, France, on 11 August 1949, exactly 5 weeks after his 5th birthday. Geneviève received custody of the young Nicholas and raised him largely as a single mother. Growing up in France, Nicholas barely saw his father and knew very little about Montenegro or his family&#x27;s history being raised and educated as a Frenchman.

In 1967 while a student he visited Montenegro for the first time, upon showing his university ID card the staff bowed upon recognising the Petrović-Njegoš name. News of his visit had spread and by the time he left the museum a crowd of 300 Montenegrins had gathered to greet him.

==Head of the royal house==
Nicholas succeeded as head of the House of Petrović-Njegoš on the death of his father in 1986 and grew closer to his Montenegrin heritage. In 1989 he received an official invitation to come to Montenegro for the reburial and state funeral of his great grandparents King Nicholas I of Montenegro and Queen Milena and their two daughters, Princess Vera and Princess Xenia. Nicholas accompanied the remains on an Italian battleship and his family received an enthusiastic welcome from Montenegrins.

During the breakup of Yugoslavia, Nicholas made several statements calling on Montenegrins not to get caught up in the violence.

Nicholas was an active participant in the campaign for the restoration of Montenegro&#x27;s independence, preceding the referendum on the separation of the former kingdom from the provisional State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. 

Nicholas chose not to attend the celebrations of the centenary of the Kingdom of Montenegro that were held on 28 August 2010. Instead, he celebrated in private.

Legislation passed in 2011 provides Nicholas with a monthly stipend equal to that of the President, and grants his family residences in Cetinje and Podgorica, the Petrović Njegoš historic family home in Njeguši, and use of the first floor of the former royal palace. The Montenegrin state also promised to pay €4.3 million to a charitable foundation administered by the family.

==Marriage and children==
On 27 November 1976 in Trébeurden, Côtes-du-Nord, he married Francine Navarro (Casablanca, 27 January 1950 - Paris, 6 August 2008), fashion designer, daughter of Antoine Navarro (Melilla, 29 January 1922 - Marseille, 12 August 1989), who fought in the French Foreign Legion, and wife Rachel Wazana (Casablanca, 19 July 1929), of Moroccan Jewish descent, paternal granddaughter of Francisco Navarro and wife Carmela Padia and maternal granddaughter of Charles Wazana and wife Fanny. Together they raised a family at Les Lilas, France: 
* Princess Altinaï of Montenegro, born at Les Lilas, Seine-Saint-Denis on 27 October 1977. She married Anton Martynov on 12 May 2009. The couple has one son: 
** Nikolai Martynov (born 30 September 2009)
* Boris, Hereditary Prince of Montenegro, Grand-Duke (Voivode) of Grahovo and Zeta, born at Les Lilas on 21 January 1980. He married Véronique Haillot Canas da Silva on 12 May 2007. The couple has two daughters.

===Awards===
* Honorary citizen of Agrigento, Sicily, Italy (23 June 2007)

===Coat of arms===

He bears the Montenegrin Coat of Arms, which can be seen at the centre of the Flag of Montenegro. The Royal Coat of Arms is borne by the head of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty, and differs from the family Coat of Arms.

The Constitution of 2007 maintained &quot;the tradition&quot; of King Nicholas I: the adopted Coat of Arms was a crowned silver eagle with the sara in one and the sceptre in the other claw, and charged on its breast was a red shield with the lion passant.

The 2011 Law on the Status of the Descendants of the Petrović Njegoš Dynasty states that Nicholas &quot;may use the heraldic symbols of the Petrović Njegoš dynasty&quot; (Article 6).

<text>Pacers is a discontinued British brand of mint flavoured confection, manufactured by Mars.

Originally known as Opal Mints, they were plain white coloured chewy spearmint flavoured sweets, launched as a sister product to Opal Fruits (now known as Starburst). The product was subsequently relaunched as Pacers around 1976, and later, three green peppermint stripes were added to the sweet, possibly to align it with a similar American product of the same name. Television commercials for the sweet alluded to sport and fitness, with participants wearing green and white-striped kit, featuring the slogan &quot;Peppermint striped for two-mint freshness&quot;. The brand was discontinued in 1985. 

At one point the Glasgow Celtic football team were nicknamed &quot;The Pacers&quot; because of the similarity of their kit to the sweets.

<doc id="1173980" wikidata="Q6795583" url="?curid=1173980" title="Maxim Ghilan">
<text>Maxim Ghilan (24 March 1931 – 2 April 2005) was an Israeli poet and activist. He was the director of the International Jewish Peace Union, the first Jewish organization to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as a partner in dialogue. He was the co-founder, in 1971, of the periodical &quot;Israel and Palestine Political Report&quot;.

==Early life==
Ghilan was born in France in 1931 and grew up in Spain. He moved with his mother to Mandatory Palestine in 1944, after his father had been abducted by the fascist movement of Francisco Franco and was never seen again.

==Lehi membership==
As a young man, Ghilan joined Lehi, also known as the Stern Gang, and participated in the struggle to free Palestine from British rule.

==After the establishment of Israel==
Following the establishment of Israel, Ghilan was imprisoned by the government of David Ben-Gurion. While incarcerated, he witnessed Arab prisoners being tortured and upon his release became active on behalf of Arab rights.

In 1966 &quot;Bul&quot;, a tabloid which employed Ghilan as its deputy editor, published a story accusing the Mossad of involvement in the 1965 disappearance of the Moroccan dissident Mehdi Ben Barka. Ghilan and his editor were charged with espionage and imprisoned for 135 days.

==Peace actions==
In the early 1970s, Ghilan became one of the first non-Communist Israelis to meet with representatives of the PLO. He later became a personal friend of Yasser Arafat. Ghilan moved to Paris in 1969 and returned to Israel after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993.

==Death==
Ghilan died suddenly in his Tel Aviv home, in Jean Jaurès St., on 2 April 2005.

<text>The Frankfort Light is a lighthouse located on the north breakwater in the harbor in Frankfort, Michigan. The current light was constructed in 1912 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

==History==

The harbor at Frankfort was first dredged in 1859. A series of improvements were begun in 1867, with piers completed in 1873. The original Frankfort North Breakwater lighthouse, an enclosed timber-framed pyramid beacon, was built in 1873 at the end of this long wooden pier with an elevated catwalk which led to the shore; the light was first lit on October 15, 1873. A fog signal was added in 1893.

In 1912, a new square steel pyramidal tower was constructed on the North Pier. The light was electrified in 1919. In the 1920s, construction began on a pair of concrete breakwaters at the harbor entrance. Construction was complete by the early 1930s. With the earlier piers now rendered obsolete, plans were made to shorten them. In 1932, the 1912 lighthouse was removed from the north pier and relocated at the head of the north breakwater. The original pyramid style lighthouse was increased in size by placing it on top of a new two-story addition.

In 2010, the US Coast Guard excessed the lighthouse, and in 2011 ownership was transferred to the city of Frankfort.

==Description==
The current breakwater light in Frankfort is located at the head of the north breakwater. It is a square steel pyramidal tower; the original 1912 lighthouse stands tall. The light is placed atop a tall square steel base. The cast iron lantern room, surrounded by a gallery, originally contained a fifth order Fresnel lens that was upgraded to a fourth order Fresnel lens. Other structures associated with the light include a radio beacon and a United States Coast Guard station.

Samuel Adler was born on December 3, 1809, in Worms, Confederation of the Rhine (present-day Germany). He received his early religious education from his father Isaac, who was one of the associate rabbis in Worms and instructed him in Hebrew and the Biblical and Rabbinic literature of the Jews. When Rabbi Isaac Adler died on December 23, 1822, thirteen-year-old Samuel, his four young siblings, and their mother were left in straitened circumstances. In spite of innumerable difficulties and extreme privation, Samuel continued his studies at the yeshivot in Worms and Frankfurt-am-Main, while concurrently pursuing a regular course of classical and general studies at the high schools of those two cities.

After graduating from the Frankfurt Gymnasium, Adler entered, in 1831, the University of Bonn and later that of Gießen, where he studied Oriental languages and philosophy for five years and awarded the Doctor of Philosophy in 1836.

==Career==
Adler assumed his first official appointment as a preacher and assistant rabbi in Worms. In 1842, he was elected rabbi of the Jewish congregations in Alzey and remained in this position until 1857.

In 1856, Adler moved to the United States. At the beginning of 1857, he received an offer from Temple Emanu-El in New York City to succeed Leo Merzbacher—recently deceased—as its rabbi. At the time, Temple Emanu-El was the leading Reform congregation in the United States. Adler accepted the call and moved to New York in March 1857. He remained active as the spiritual head of Emanu-El until 1874, when he was made rabbi &quot;emeritus&quot; and relieved from active work. He was succeeded by Gustav Gottheil. During his tenure, Adler continued conducting synagogue services in German (in preference to the traditional Hebrew), for the congregation mainly consisted of prosperous German immigrant families. Adler also revised the German prayerbook introduced by Merzbacher and authored the bilingual &quot;A Guide to the Instruction in the Israelitish Religion&quot; (&quot;Leitfaden für den israelitischen Religionsunterricht)&quot; for use in Emanu El&#x27;s Hebrew Sunday school.

Adler was not merely a thorough Talmudic scholar but also had a considerable command of the knowledge of various issues concerning the Jews, including their history, religion, and literature. Adler was committed to translating his scholarship into social action.

During the twenty-one years of his career in Germany, he campaigned for the emancipation of the Jews from their civil disabilities, especially for the removal of the humiliating oath known as the &quot;more judaico&quot;. Adler succeeded in having the Jewish religion taught on equal terms with Protestantism and Catholicism in the lower and higher schools of Worms. He pushed for the recognition of gender equality within Judaism. Through his influence, the &quot;mechitza&quot;, which had segregated the women from the men in the ancient synagogue of Worms, was leveled, allowing the sexes to sit with each other during services.

Adler gave special attention to improving the religious instruction of the young, both in the city and the rural schools he supervised. He sought to enhance the order, solemnity, and dignity of public worship and was instrumental in founding several new charitable institutions. Above all, with patience and zeal, he persuaded his congregations to let go of the deadening influence of religious literalism. In this endeavor, he frequently drew upon the storehouse of his great Talmudic learning for the arguments that he used in his struggle for progress, always seeking to rest the reformation of manners upon a basis of inward conviction and favoring a gradual transformation rather than an abrupt transition from the old to the new.

He belonged to what may be called the historico-critical school of Jewish theology. He was a highly-respected citizen of New York, keeping in touch with modern thought and progress and accomplishing a vast amount of good. He contributed scholarly articles to several learned periodicals; for example, &quot;Contributions to the History of Sadduceeism&quot;, &quot;Jewish Conference Papers&quot;, and &quot;Benedictions&quot;. Some of these the author collected and published under the Hebrew title &quot;Kobez &#x27;al Yad&quot; (Collections) in 1886, mainly as a souvenir for his friends.

==Death and legacy==
Adler died on June 9, 1891, in Manhattan, New York, and rests in Salem Fields Cemetery of Brooklyn, New York. His extensive library of rabbinical literature was donated by his family to Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati.

==Family==
Adler married Henrietta Frankfurter.
* His son Felix Adler (1851–1933), was the founder of the Society for Ethical Culture.
* His son Isaac Adler was a physician and educator.
* His daughter Sarah Adler Goldman, married to Julius Goldman (1852–1909), German Jew of the Goldman–Sachs family.

<text>The Ludington Light is a tall steel-plated lighthouse in Ludington, Michigan, which lies along the eastern shores of Lake Michigan, at the end of the breakwater on the Pere Marquette Harbor. Given its location on the northern breakwater where the Pere Marquette River meets Lake Michigan, it is sometimes known as the Ludington North Breakwater Light. Underlying the building itself is a prow-like structure, which is designed to break waves.

==History==
The station was established in 1871. This light was first lit in 1924, and it is presently operational. It was automated in 1972. The light is structurally integrated into the steel and reinforced concrete pier upon which it is built. It has a square pyramidal form, and is white with a black lantern. The original lens was a Fourth Order Fresnel lens. On October 17, 1995 the Fresnel lens was removed from the lantern. It was replaced by a Tideland Signal ML-300 acrylic optic. The original lens was loaned to Historic White Pine Village where it is displayed as part of their maritime history exhibit.

A fog signal building is integrated into the tower. It originally had a Type F Diaphone signal, and a FA-232 is now in operation. A radio beacon is also in place and operational.

In 2006, the Ludington Breakwater Lighthouse was opened to the public for the first time in its history. The Coast Guard transferred ownership to the City of Ludington under the terms of the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act. The lighthouse is being operated and maintained in partnership with the Sable Points Lighthouse Keepers Association, which is a volunteer group that maintains, restores and operates this light, the Big Sable Point Lighthouse and the Little Sable Point Lighthouse.

The lighthouse is open to the public during the summer season for climbing tours.

<doc id="1174012" wikidata="Q6320434" url="?curid=1174012" title="Józef Białynia Chołodecki">
<text>Józef Dominik &quot;Kresowiec&quot; Bartłomiej [[Chołodecki]] (15 August 1852 – 30 January 1934) was a Polish historian.

==Biography==
Chołodecki was born in 1852 in in the Galician region of the then Austro-Hungarian empire, close to the present day city of L&#x27;viv in Ukraine. His adopted middle name of Bialynia refers to the clan and Coat of Arms of his family. Chołodecki was the son of Celestyn, a writer and a &quot;nadleśniczy&quot; of the forestry department in Galicia, and Emilia from the house of Setti da Forli. His academic studies began at home, and continued at primary school in Stryj located in present-day Ukraine. He attended high school in Lwów, and took his maturity exam on 10 October 1870. That same year he enrolled at the University of Lwów to study law, graduating in 1874.

He had to work even while attending high school due to his father&#x27;s death. In 1873, a year prior to finishing his law degree, Józef applied to the Directors of the Lwów postal service. He received a position with the postal service in Czerlany, later in Niżniów, Stanisławów, and finally in Lwów. In 1880 he became the regional director of the commissars postal service in Czerniowce, he quickly rose up the ranks of the postal service until he became the director of the account departments of the Lwów postal service. He retired while at this position on his own request in 1909.

==Patriotic traditions==
Chołodecki left his home with a strong patriotic tradition. His father, who took part in two uprisings and was jailed as a political dissident as a result, as well as other close family like Tomasz Chołodecki, a veteran of the November Uprising, had a strong influence on his upbringing. At the age of 12, he took part in the January Uprising of 1863 as courier in the territories surrounding Lwów. In 1867 while still in high school he was part of an underground student organization which was later dissolved by the Austrian authorities. While a student at the University of Lwów, Chołodecki was the most active member of the highly regarded Academic Reading room (&quot;Czytelnia Akademicka&quot;), he took an active part in an assortment of Polish organizations throughout the region. In Czerniowce he became a contributor to &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot;, a newspaper run by Klemens Kościesz Kołakowski. He became a member of the board of &quot;Czytelnia Polska&quot;, founded a library and wrote a history of the &quot;Czytelnia&quot; in 1885. 

In his first literary endeavors, books and pamphlets printed from the presses of &quot;Gazeta Polska&quot;, Chołodecki wrote under the pseudonym of Walenty Ćwik, this included his historical book about Bukowina in 1884, an examination of the history of the Polish Navy and Polish artillery in 1885, and a biography of Henryk Schmitt in 1888. He used an assumed name fearing repression by the Austrian authorities. Finally he presented his literary ambitions to the minister of trade, and due to his influence through his position at the postal service in Lwów, he was granted the right to publish books under his name.

==Life in Lwów==
After moving to Lwów, Chołodecki joined numerous organizations, becoming the president of the Postal Club, and he was able to create many other organizations that were able to grow through his support. He was verbally attacked by the president of the Lwów postal service, a man surnamed Seferowicz, in 1906 for his vigorous activity in these organizations, which the President claimed discredited him as a director at the Lwów postal service. 

Chołodecki vehemently denied the charge and accused Seferowicz of a personal attack. Chołodecki was also part of many of intellectual circles and organizations, including the Organization for Polish Education, the Heraldic Organization, Organization of Studies in Przemyśl, and the Organization of Lwów Historians (&quot;Tow. Miłośników przeszłości Lwowa&quot;), which printed many of his most famous and renowned works. Between 1902 and 1908 Chołodecki was a &quot;radny&quot; for the city of Lwów. During World War I Chołodecki was jailed by the Tsarist authorities in Kiev, and he took part in the defense of Lwów during the Polish-Ukrainian War. 

==Life as a writer==
As a writer, many of Chołodecki&#x27;s works dealt with the Polish November Uprising of 1830 and January Uprising of 1863. He also wrote the biographies of many prominent individuals in Poland&#x27;s fight for independence. Chołodecki was a chronicler of the family history and genealogy of the Chołodecki family. He was awarded the order Polonia Restituta. He died in Lwów on 30 January 1934, aged 81.

<doc id="1174032" wikidata="Q1076426" url="?curid=1174032" title="Uxoricide">
<text>Uxoricide (from Latin &quot;uxor&quot; meaning &quot;wife&quot; and -cide, from &quot;caedere&quot; meaning &quot;to cut, to kill&quot;) is the killing of one&#x27;s own wife. It can also be used in the context of the killing of one&#x27;s own girlfriend. It can refer to the act itself or the person who carries it out. Conversely, the killing of a husband or boyfriend is called mariticide.

== Rates of uxoricide ==
Though overall rates of spousal violence and homicide in the US have declined since the 1970s, rates of uxoricide are significantly higher than rates of mariticide (the murder of a husband). Of the 2340 deaths at the hands of intimate partners in the US in 2007, female victims made up 70%. FBI data from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s found that for every 100 husbands who killed their wives in the United States, about 75 women killed their husbands. However, wives were more likely to kill their husbands than vice versa in some US cities including Chicago, Detroit, Houston, and St. Louis. Uxoricide rates varied among different demographic subgroups. In the US, 2002 murderers of spouses (husband and wives combined) were 69.4% white, 25.7% black and 4.8% Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.1 American Indian/ Alaska Native.

In the region of South-East Asia, 55% of all murdered women died at the hands of their partner, followed by 40% in the African region and 38% in the Americas. A 2013 study found that 38.6% of murders of women are committed by intimate partners.

Rates of uxoricide seem to fluctuate across western cultures, with approximately seven women being killed per month in England and Wales, approximately four women per month in Australia, and approximately 76 women per month in the United States. Note that these data come from different years and represent raw data, having neither been adjusted for nor indexed by country population.

==Psychodynamic explanations==
===Unconscious conflict===
Proponents of psychodynamic theories have offered explanations for the mechanisms underlying the occurrence of uxoricide. It has been suggested that men who kill their partners experience both an unconscious dependence on their wife and a resentment of her. These men wish to leave the relationship, but unknowingly perceive themselves as too helpless to do so, which culminates into a belief that killing the wife is the only way to be free of her. This approach also offers an alternative explanation for instances where a man commits uxoricide and subsequent immediate suicide – the man ends his life not due to guilt, but instead due to his perceived helplessness and dependency.

===Defense mechanisms===
Links have also been established between violence in childhood and likelihood of uxoricide occurring. Psychodynamic researchers argue that being the victim of abuse in childhood leads to being a perpetrator of domestic abuse in adulthood via the route of defense mechanisms – in this case, violence is an unconscious defensive adaption to childhood trauma and other adverse events. Other psychodynamic researchers have reported that Thematic Apperception Tests reveal significant trends of rejection by a mother or wife in men who commit uxoricide. Psychoanalytic dream interpretation has also argued that unconscious conflict manifests into violent outbursts. For example, in one instance one man had experienced and recorded over 200 distressing, mostly violent dreams prior to murdering his wife.

== Risk factors ==
In slightly more than two-thirds of US spousal homicides, a verbal disagreement escalated to homicide.

===Marital status===
In two studies conducted in Canada and Britain, cohabiting women were found at greater risk of domestic violence and uxoricide than married women. Research has found that cohabiting women are nine times more likely to be killed by their intimate partner than married women. A number of possible reasons for this finding have been studied. Cohabiting women are more likely to be younger, have a lower level of education and are more likely to bring children from a previous relationship into their home with their new intimate partner. In addition to this heightened risk to a mother with stepchildren, the genetically unrelated stepfather also poses a risk to the child; research has shown that children are at much greater risk of violence and filicide (murder of a child) from stepfathers compared to a genetic father. This may be because investment from a stepfather reduces reproductive benefits. Research has found that the presence of stepchildren can significantly increase the risk of uxoricide for women. A large number of filicides are accompanied by uxoricide and suicide.

Additionally, cohabiting relationships have higher separation rates and males in these types of relationships may not feel in control of their intimate partners and may feel threatened by male sexual competitors. Research has found that a large proportion of uxoricide cases follow on from the male believing that his female intimate partner has been unfaithful or the female partner attempting to end the relationship. Research has shown that females often experience increased abuse following the termination of a relationship. An Australian study found that of a sample of uxoricide cases, 47% of women were murdered by their male intimate partner within two months of separating. Sexual jealousy may be a possible reason for this heightened risk following separation.

===Partner separation===

Another risk factor for uxoricide is estrangement. Women who choose to leave their partner are at higher risk of spousal homicide. These crimes have been termed &quot;abandonment homicides&quot;, and are most commonly committed by men with childhood histories of abandonment and trauma, in conjunction with markedly low serotonin levels and frontal cortex damage that contribute to poor impulse control. The male is more likely to kill his mate before she has had the chance to form a new relationship with another man as he fears she will then devote her reproductive resources to a male rival&#x27;s offspring. Therefore, by killing his partner he will avoid the reputational damage associated with intrasexual competition and will eliminate the chances of another man having access to a high value mate. This also explains why those women who have had children from a previous relationship are at higher risk of spousal homicide compared with those who have only had children with their current partner. The female partner has already devoted her reproductive resources to another man, therefore when she establishes a new relationship, the male becomes involved in the upbringing of another man&#x27;s offspring which will damage his hierarchical status amongst intrasexual rivals.

===Age===
The greater age disparity between spouses, the higher risk of spousal homicide. For a male, the damage associated with infidelity is greater when the partner is younger. A woman&#x27;s fertility decreases as she gets older, therefore, age is key indicator of reproductive success. As a result, a man will place high levels of importance on a mate with greater reproductive value. A man is more likely to engage in &quot;hands on&quot; killing methods when the mate has high reproductive value. &quot;Hands on&quot; refers to more violent methods such as using weapons, drowning, stabbing and strangling.

===Culture and law===
Some instances of uxoricide are facilitated by the culture of the victim and the perpetrator. For example, honor killings, whereby a man kills his wife because she has brought shame upon their family, are approved in some male-dominated, patriarchal societies. Approximately 42% of female victims of honour killings worldwide were killed because it was believed they had committed a &quot;sexual impropriety&quot;. Other facilitating cultural norms include discriminatory family laws and articles in the criminal code which display leniency towards honor killings. In Turkey, it has been reported that little social stigma is attached to honor killings, and around 37% of those living in conservative areas believe that adulterous women should be killed. These attitudes favouring honor killings have also been echoed amongst children and adults in Jordan and India. In Uruguay, until 2017 crimes of passion related to adultery were tolerated under Article 36 of the Penal Code (The passion provoked by adultery) – &quot;Artículo 36. (La pasión provocada por el adulterio)&quot;. On 22 December 2017, Article 36 of the Criminal Code was modified to remove the crime of passion. There had been ongoing political efforts to remove this provision from the criminal code since 2013. Uruguay has a very high rate of killing of women; according to a 2018 United Nations study, Uruguay has the second-highest rate of killings of women by current or former partners in Latin America, after the Dominican Republic.

Uxoricide can also be prevalent in countries where honor killings are not considered acceptable. In South Africa, for example, as many as five women are estimated to be killed each week by an intimate partner. It has been suggested that this high rate of uxoricide is a result of the prevalence of violence in South African society, and how it is deemed socially acceptable in many circumstances – conservative attitudes towards women in this society have been suggested to facilitate uxoricide. Studies conducted in Italy exhibit similar findings, reporting that a man&#x27;s cultural values concerning the position of women in society links to his likelihood of committing uxoricide.

==Effects on children==

When a parent kills another parent, children experience significant trauma. The other parent is likely to be in prison or may have died by suicide and therefore, the child will go through significant loss. The child has lost not only one parent but has also lost the other parent who would have helped and supported them through this loss. This type of extreme traumatic event can have serious implications for a child&#x27;s wellbeing and mental health.

<text>Lollia Paulina (sometimes written Paullina) ( – 49 AD) was a Roman empress for six months in 38 as the third wife of the Roman emperor Caligula.

==Family background and early life==
Paulina was a member of the plebeian gens Lollia. Paulina was the second daughter of Marcus Lollius with Volusia Saturnina, while her elder sister was Lollia Saturnina. Her &quot;cognomen&quot; &quot;Paulina&quot; probably derived from her maternal grandmother Nonia Polla.

Her father, Marcus Lollius was the son born to the Roman politician and military officer Marcus Lollius from his wife Aurelia. Aurelia was the adoptive sister of Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus. Her possible paternal uncle may have been Publius Lollius Maximus, however this is unclear and he was at least a close relation.

Paulina was born and raised in Rome and became very wealthy after inheriting the estates of her relatives. She inherited the large fortune from her paternal grandfather, thus was the heiress of Marcus Lollius.

==Marriages and rivals==
The first husband of Paulina was Publius Memmius Regulus, a man of consular rank, who served as a suffect consul in 31 and later, as a Roman governor. Tacitus describes him as a man of &#x27;dignity, who was a person of influence and good name&#x27;, who died in 62.

In 38, Paulina was with Regulus at the province he was governing when Caligula ordered her to leave her husband upon overhearing a remark about the beauty of her grandmother. She was forced to divorce Regulus and marry Caligula, becoming his third wife and Roman Empress that same year. Caligula divorced her after six months of marriage, ostensibly because she was infertile, and forbade her to sleep with or associate with another man.

In 48, Paulina became a rival to the sister of Caligula, Agrippina the Younger. Paulina was considered as a choice as the fourth wife of the paternal uncle of Caligula, the Roman emperor Claudius, following the death of the third wife of Claudius, the Roman empress Valeria Messalina. In 49, Agrippina the Younger married Claudius. Sometime after, Agrippina the Younger had Paulina charged with sorcery, accused of having entered into forbidden consultations with astrologers. Without a hearing, the property of Paulina (including her gardens) was confiscated and she was sent into exile. Tacitus reported that Paulina was forced to commit suicide under the watch of a colonel of the Guards and implied that this was done under the orders of Agrippina the Younger. A sepulchre was not erected in her honor until the reign of the Roman emperor Nero.

==Reputation==
Paulina is mentioned in &quot;Natural History&quot; by Pliny the Elder. Pliny mentions Paulina as an example of Roman ostentation for wearing a large share of her inheritance to a dinner party in the form of jewellery worth to the value of 50 million sesterces. She would wear her jewels in her hair, round her neck, arms and fingers. The complaint of Pliny was made in the context of Rome spending enormous amounts for importing Ancient India&#x27;s &#x27;useless&#x27; pepper and pearls, as worn by Paulina even around her shoes.

==In fiction==
Paulina is a character in the novel series, &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, written by Robert Graves.

<text>Rock magnetism is the study of the magnetic properties of rocks, sediments and soils. The field arose out of the need in paleomagnetism to understand how rocks record the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. This remanence is carried by minerals, particularly certain strongly magnetic minerals like magnetite (the main source of magnetism in lodestone). An understanding of remanence helps paleomagnetists to develop methods for measuring the ancient magnetic field and correct for effects like sediment compaction and metamorphism. Rock magnetic methods are used to get a more detailed picture of the source of the distinctive striped pattern in marine magnetic anomalies that provides important information on plate tectonics. They are also used to interpret terrestrial magnetic anomalies in magnetic surveys as well as the strong crustal magnetism on Mars.

Strongly magnetic minerals have properties that depend on the size, shape, defect structure and concentration of the minerals in a rock. Rock magnetism provides non-destructive methods for analyzing these minerals such as magnetic hysteresis measurements, temperature-dependent remanence measurements, Mössbauer spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance and so on. With such methods, rock magnetists can measure the effects of past climate change and human impacts on the mineralogy (see environmental magnetism). In sediments, a lot of the magnetic remanence is carried by minerals that were created by magnetotactic bacteria, so rock magnetists have made significant contributions to biomagnetism.

== History ==

Until the 20th century, the study of the Earth&#x27;s field (geomagnetism and paleomagnetism) and of magnetic materials (especially ferromagnetism) developed separately.

Rock magnetism had its start when scientists brought these two fields together in the laboratory. Koenigsberger (1938), Thellier (1938) and Nagata (1943) investigated the origin of remanence in igneous rocks. By heating rocks and archeological materials to high temperatures in a magnetic field, they gave the materials a thermoremanent magnetization (TRM), and they investigated the properties of this magnetization. Thellier developed a series of conditions (the Thellier laws) that, if fulfilled, would allow the determination of the intensity of the ancient magnetic field to be determined using the Thellier–Thellier method. In 1949, Louis Néel developed a theory that explained these observations, showed that the Thellier laws were satisfied by certain kinds of single-domain magnets, and introduced the concept of blocking of TRM.

When paleomagnetic work in the 1950s lent support to the theory of continental drift, skeptics were quick to question whether rocks could carry a stable remanence for geological ages.
Rock magnetists were able to show that rocks could have more than one component of remanence, some soft (easily removed) and some very stable. To get at the stable part, they took to &quot;cleaning&quot; samples by heating them or exposing them to an alternating field. However, later events, particularly the recognition that many North American rocks had been pervasively remagnetized in the Paleozoic, showed that a single cleaning step was inadequate, and paleomagnetists began to routinely use stepwise demagnetization to strip away the remanence in small bits.

== Fundamentals ==
=== Types of magnetic order ===

The contribution of a mineral to the total magnetism of a rock depends strongly on the type of magnetic order or disorder. Magnetically disordered minerals (diamagnets and paramagnets) contribute a weak magnetism and have no remanence. The more important minerals for rock magnetism are the minerals that can be magnetically ordered, at least at some temperatures. These are the ferromagnets, ferrimagnets and certain kinds of antiferromagnets. These minerals have a much stronger response to the field and can have a remanence.

==== Diamagnetism ====

Diamagnetism is a magnetic response shared by all substances. In response to an applied magnetic field, electrons precess (see Larmor precession), and by Lenz&#x27;s law they act to shield the interior of a body from the magnetic field. Thus, the moment produced is in the opposite direction to the field and the susceptibility is negative. This effect is weak but independent of temperature. A substance whose only magnetic response is diamagnetism is called a diamagnet.

==== Paramagnetism ====

Paramagnetism is a weak positive response to a magnetic field due to rotation of electron spins. Paramagnetism occurs in certain kinds of iron-bearing minerals because the iron contains an unpaired electron in one of their shells (see Hund&#x27;s rules). Some are paramagnetic down to absolute zero and their susceptibility is inversely proportional to the temperature (see Curie&#x27;s law); others are magnetically ordered below a critical temperature and the susceptibility increases as it approaches that temperature (see Curie–Weiss law).

==== Ferromagnetism ====

Collectively, strongly magnetic materials are often referred to as ferromagnets. However, this magnetism can arise as the result of more than one kind of magnetic order. In the strict sense, ferromagnetism refers to magnetic ordering where neighboring electron spins are aligned by the exchange interaction. The classic ferromagnet is iron. Below a critical temperature called the Curie temperature, ferromagnets have a spontaneous magnetization and there is hysteresis in their response to a changing magnetic field. Most importantly for rock magnetism, they have remanence, so they can record the Earth&#x27;s field.

Iron does not occur widely in its pure form. It is usually incorporated into iron oxides, oxyhydroxides and sulfides. In these compounds, the iron atoms are not close enough for direct exchange, so they are coupled by indirect exchange or superexchange. The result is that the crystal lattice is divided into two or more sublattices with different moments.

==== Ferrimagnetism ====

Ferrimagnets have two sublattices with opposing moments. One sublattice has a larger moment, so there is a net unbalance. Magnetite, the most important of the magnetic minerals, is a ferrimagnet. Ferrimagnets often behave like ferromagnets, but the temperature dependence of their spontaneous magnetization can be quite different. Louis Néel identified four types of temperature dependence, one of which involves a reversal of the magnetization. This phenomenon played a role in controversies over marine magnetic anomalies.

==== Antiferromagnetism ====

Antiferromagnets, like ferrimagnets, have two sublattices with opposing moments, but now the moments are equal in magnitude. If the moments are exactly opposed, the magnet has no remanence. However, the moments can be tilted (spin canting), resulting in a moment nearly at right angles to the moments of the sublattices. Hematite has this kind of magnetism.

== Magnetic mineralogy ==
== Types of remanence ==

Magnetic remanence is often identified with a particular kind of remanence that is obtained after exposing a magnet to a field at room temperature. However, the Earth&#x27;s field is not large, and this kind of remanence would be weak and easily overwritten by later fields. A central part of rock magnetism is the study of magnetic remanence, both as natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in rocks obtained from the field and remanence induced in the laboratory. Below are listed the important natural remanences and some artificially induced kinds.

=== Thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) ===

When an igneous rock cools, it acquires a &quot;thermoremanent magnetization (TRM)&quot; from the Earth&#x27;s field. TRM can be much larger than it would be if exposed to the same field at room temperature (see isothermal remanence). This remanence can also be very stable, lasting without significant change for millions of years. TRM is the main reason that paleomagnetists are able to deduce the direction and magnitude of the ancient Earth&#x27;s field.

If a rock is later re-heated (as a result of burial, for example), part or all of the TRM can be replaced by a new remanence. If it is only part of the remanence, it is known as &quot;partial thermoremanent magnetization (pTRM)&quot;. Because numerous experiments have been done modeling different ways of acquiring remanence, pTRM can have other meanings. For example, it can also be acquired in the laboratory by cooling in zero field to a temperature formula_1 (below the Curie temperature), applying a magnetic field and cooling to a temperature formula_2, then cooling the rest of the way to room temperature in zero field.

The standard model for TRM is as follows. When a mineral such as magnetite cools below the Curie temperature, it becomes ferromagnetic but is not immediately capable of carrying a remanence. Instead, it is superparamagnetic, responding reversibly to changes in the magnetic field. For remanence to be possible there must be a strong enough magnetic anisotropy to keep the magnetization near a stable state; otherwise, thermal fluctuations make the magnetic moment wander randomly. As the rock continues to cool, there is a critical temperature at which the magnetic anisotropy becomes large enough to keep the moment from wandering: this temperature is called the &quot;blocking temperature&quot; and referred to by the symbol formula_3. The magnetization remains in the same state as the rock is cooled to room temperature and becomes a thermoremanent magnetization.

=== Chemical (or crystallization) remanent magnetization (CRM) ===
Magnetic grains may precipitate from a circulating solution, or be formed during chemical reactions, and may record the direction of the magnetic field at the time of mineral formation. The field is said to be recorded by &quot;chemical remanent magnetization (CRM)&quot;. The mineral recording the field commonly is hematite, another iron oxide. Redbeds, clastic sedimentary rocks (such as sandstones) that are red primarily because of hematite formation during or after sedimentary diagenesis, may have useful CRM signatures, and magnetostratigraphy can be based on such signatures.

=== Depositional remanent magnetization (DRM) ===
Magnetic grains in sediments may align with the magnetic field during or soon after deposition; this is known as detrital remanent magnetization (DRM). If the magnetization is acquired as the grains are deposited, the result is a depositional detrital remanent magnetization (dDRM); if it is acquired soon after deposition, it is a &quot;post-depositional detrital remanent magnetization (pDRM)&quot;.

=== Viscous remanent magnetization ===
&quot;Viscous remanent magnetization (VRM)&quot;, also known as viscous magnetization, is remanence that is acquired by ferromagnetic minerals by sitting in a magnetic field for some time. The natural remanent magnetization of an igneous rock can be altered by this process. To remove this component, some form of stepwise demagnetization must be used.

<doc id="1174056" wikidata="Q5496178" url="?curid=1174056" title="Fred Root">
<text>Charles Frederick Root (16 April 1890 – 20 January 1954) was an English cricketer who played for England in 1926 and for Derbyshire between 1910 and 1920 and for Worcestershire between 1921 and 1932.

== Early career ==
Root was born in Somercotes, Derbyshire and initially served on ground staff of Leicestershire before beginning his first-class career for Derbyshire, making his debut in the 1910 season. He played for five seasons for Derbyshire before cricket was suspended in England because of World War I, doing very little apart from a couple of promising performances in 1913. During the war, Root was hit in the chest while serving as a dispatch rider, but recovered and resumed his cricketing career after the war.

== Worcestershire ==

Root moved to Worcestershire in 1921 after two seasons in league cricket. After a season and a half when he failed to establish himself as an orthodox right-arm fast medium bowler, Root became an exponent of the leg theory style of bowling, and achieved great success with it. His ability to swing the ball in and make it gain pace off the ground made him very difficult on anything like a fiery pitch, whilst his powerful physique and consequent stamina made Root respected even on pitches giving bowlers no assistance. In 1923 he took 170 wickets for 20.53 each and 153 for less than 17 each in 1924, but spoilt his chances of going on that winter&#x27;s Ashes tour with a poor performance for the Players at The Oval on a pitch that should have suited him.

His character may be summed up by an event in a match against Glamorgan. The batsmen, Arnold Dyson and Eddie Bates, had collided mid-pitch, and the ball was returned to Root, the bowler. Root didn&#x27;t break the stumps, as both batsmen seemed injured. An amateur repeatedly shouted, &quot;Break the wicket, Fred, break the wicket!&quot; until Root said: &quot;If you want to run him out, here&#x27;s the ball: you come and do it.&quot; The amateur responded with the words, &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m an amateur. &quot;I&quot; can&#x27;t do such a thing.&quot;

== England selection ==

Although Worcestershire were entering a period where they were the weakest of the County teams, Root&#x27;s tireless, accurate and lively bowling only improved. In 1925, he took a record 207 wickets for the county, almost half of Worcestershire&#x27;s wickets in first-class matches. During the late 1920s, Root was effectively the team&#x27;s only penetrative bowler.

In 1926, Root took 7 for 42 against the Australians on a pitch so dead as to be quite unsuited to him. Though he was less effective than previously in county cricket (soft pitches may have played a part), Root played three Test matches for England against Australia that year. Unusually, he was unable to bat in any of the three tests, due to rain interruptions and the depth of the England batting. Root still holds the record for the most Test Matches in a career without ever batting.

== Later years ==

In 1927, Root took 145 Championship wickets as the County won only one of thirty fixtures. The batsman&#x27;s pitches of 1928 resulted in an expensive yield though he did achieve the double for the only time in his career. Root&#x27;s 146 wickets in 1929 was almost triple the next best return by his teammates. In 1931, he took 9 for 23 against Lancashire, representing the best bowling ever achieved for Worcestershire.

Root declined rapidly in 1932 and lost his place. Apart from one match for Sir L Parkinson&#x27;s XI in 1933, Root retired from first-class cricket after this. He spent some time as coach to Leicestershire, and also continued to play club cricket in the Lancashire League. He also remained a keen observer of the international game, and was unimpressed by Australian protests against Bodyline, saying that their players should stick to playing with tennis balls if they could not learn how to play it. Root also wrote a well-known book about the life of professional cricketers, &quot;A Cricket Pro&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1937).

== As an umpire ==

Root stood as an umpire in 35 first-class matches between 1947 and 1949.

== Bowling method ==

After Root joined Worcestershire, he changed his bowling style to deliver fast-medium in-swingers with a leg trap of up to five fielders. An illustration appears in the 1926 Cricketer of this employed against Australia. There is speculation that it may have influenced the thinking of Douglas Jardine when he was contemplating the use of bodyline against Don Bradman. Current regulations render this illegal.

Root died in a Wolverhampton hospital in 1954.

<doc id="1174058" wikidata="Q4216205" url="?curid=1174058" title="USS Potomac (1822)">
<text>USS &quot;Potomac&quot; was a frigate in the United States Navy laid down by the Washington Navy Yard in August 1819 and launched in March 1822. Fitting out was not completed until 1831, when Captain John Downes assumed command as first commanding officer. Although called a &quot;44&quot; 1st class, she was built to mount 32 carronades on her spar deck, 30 long guns on her gun deck, two bow and three stern chasers on each of these decks, significantly under-rating her on the rating system of the Royal Navy.

==Service history==
On her first overseas cruise, &quot;Potomac&quot; departed New York 19 August 1831 for the Pacific Squadron via the Cape of Good Hope on the first Sumatran Expedition. On 6 February 1832, &quot;Potomac&quot; destroyed the town of Kuala Batee in retaliation for the capture there in February of the previous year of the American merchantman &quot;Friendship&quot;, which had been recaptured and returned to Salem to report the murder of many of her crew. Of &quot;Potomac&quot;″s 282 sailors and Marines who landed, two were killed while 150 natives died, including Mahomet, the chieftain. After circumnavigating the world, &quot;Potomac&quot; returned to Boston 23 May 1834.

The frigate next made two cruises to the Brazil Station, protecting American interests in Latin America from 20 October 1834 to 5 March 1837, and from 12 May 1840 to 31 July 1842. From 8 December 1844 to 4 December 1845, she patrolled in the West Indies, and again from 14 March 1846 to 20 July 1847 in the Caribbean and the Gulf. During this latter period, she landed troops at Port Isabel, Texas, on 8 May 1846 in support of General Zachary Taylor&#x27;s army at the Battle of Palo Alto. She also participated in the siege of Vera Cruz, 9 to 28 March 1847.

&quot;Potomac&quot; served as flagship for the Home Squadron 1855–1856. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, she departed from New York City on 10 September 1861 for the West Gulf Blockading Squadron off Mobile Bay. At this time, William Thomas Sampson served aboard her until 25 December 1861 when he transferred to the as executive officer. Black Nova Scotian sailor Benjamin Jackson also served onboard until he was reassigned to the . The &quot;Potomac&quot; became the stores ship for the squadron and remained at Pensacola Navy Yard as a receiving ship until 1867, when she was sent to Philadelphia. She remained at League Island Navy Yard until her decommissioning on 13 January 1877. She was sold to E. Stannard &amp; Company 24 May 1877.

<text>The Williamson Tunnels are a series of extensive subterranean excavations in the Edge Hill area of Liverpool, England. They are thought to have been created under the direction of tobacco merchant, landowner and philanthropist Joseph Williamson between 1810 and 1840. Although popularly described as &quot;tunnels&quot;, the majority comprise brick or stone vaulting over excavations in the underlying sandstone. The purpose of the works remains unclear and remains a subject of heavy speculation; suggestions include commercial quarrying, a philanthropic desire to provide employment, and Williamson&#x27;s own eccentric interests.

After being gradually infilled with rubble and spoil during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they remained largely inaccessible until archaeological investigations were carried out in 1995. Since then volunteers have rediscovered and excavated an extensive network of tunnels, chambers and voids across several sites, with sections open to the public. Guided tours are available at the Williamson Tunnels Heritage Centre and the Friends of Williamson&#x27;s Tunnels, and volunteers continue to uncover new sections.

==History==
In 1805, wealthy businessman Joseph Williamson acquired an area of land in Mason Street, Edge Hill, Liverpool, which was then a largely undeveloped outcrop of sandstone with a scattering of scars from small-scale quarrying. The land was held under a lease from the West Derby Waste Commissioners, who retained rights to the minerals under it: Williamson started to build houses on the site, which then adjoined growing and fashionable areas of Liverpool.

According to the account of a 19th-century Liverpool antiquarian, James Stonehouse, these houses were eccentric in design and &quot;of the strangest description&quot; without any rational plans. The ground behind them dropped sharply, and in order to provide large gardens Williamson built arched terraces over which the gardens could be extended. He continued to erect and alter many further buildings on the site during the period, including a large house in Mason Street occupied by himself and his wife. To carry out the work he recruited a large pool of labour from among the poor and needy of the area, including soldiers left unemployed at the end of the Napoleonic War; according to Stonehouse, he occasionally engaged them to carry out apparently pointless tasks, such as moving rubble from one place to another, then back again.

Over the same period, his workers also excavated a series of brick-arched tunnels and vaults at various depths within the sandstone. They covered a wide area, extending to the boundaries of Williamson&#x27;s lease and possibly beyond. Stonehouse, who traversed parts of the tunnels in 1845, described the excavations as a labyrinth of &quot;vaulted passages [...] pits deep, and yawning chasms&quot;, including a &quot;fearful opening&quot; beneath Grinfield Street with two &quot;complete four-roomed houses&quot; in the side of it connected by a spiral passage. This apparent tunnel-building activity continued until Williamson&#x27;s death in 1840. In August 1867 the &quot;Liverpool Porcupine&quot; described the tunnels as being &quot;a great nuisance&quot; because drains ran straight into them, in one place creating a cess pool full of offensive water deep, and they were being used for dumping refuse, including down chutes built into the buildings above for the purpose.

In the later 19th century the Corporation of Liverpool began backfilling the tunnels with rubble and other waste from building demolition, a process that continued sporadically into the 20th century. Little information about the excavations had been recorded and nearly all knowledge of them, and of Williamson&#x27;s life in general, was derived from the 1845 account of James Stonehouse. Although not published at the time it was written, it was referenced in Stonehouse&#x27;s later works and was finally reprinted in full by Charles Hand as part of a 1916 article, &quot;Joseph Williamson, the King of Edge Hill&quot;, published in the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Lancashire and Cheshire Historical Society. Hand&#x27;s work saw a brief revival of interest in Williamson and his life.

==Early investigations and archaeology==
In 1881, the North Staffordshire Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers conducted a field trip to Liverpool during which they surveyed some of the surviving excavations, producing a plan and dog-leg section of the main parts of the site.

In the early 20th century, soldiers from the 1st Lancashire Engineers and the West Lancashire Territorial Forces Association, whose drill hall in Mason Street stood on top of one of the tunnels, carried out additional surveys. The Association produced a map of the excavations although, as many were filled with rubble, this had to be left incomplete. The map also showed the course of the London and North Western Railway cutting between Edge Hill and Lime Street stations which ran through the area.

Public interest in the tunnels waned through much of the 20th century and many of the sites were further buried or destroyed by new construction. However, from the 1980s onwards interest in Williamson steadily increased, leading to the formation of the two major societies and, eventually, excavation of tunnels across several sites. In 1995 a geology student from Liverpool University carried out a micro-gravity survey of the site. Some of his findings were ambiguous, perhaps due to rubble infill, and not all of them seemed to correspond with those of the Forces Association&#x27;s 1907 map. Later that year a professional firm, Parkman, carried out a survey on behalf of the Joseph Williamson Society.

Both societies eventually acquired the rights to begin digging, and over time a considerable portion of Williamson&#x27;s legacy has been rediscovered and cleared of the last two centuries&#x27; accumulated spoil and rubble. In the course of excavation, a substantial number of artefacts have been found – some dating back as far as the 1830s – including bottles, plates and other crockery, pipes, vintage signs, military items and other items, much of which was probably refuse dumped in the tunnels. Many of these finds have been cleaned and put on display.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;The known tunnels are in an area to the east of the Roman Catholic Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral in a rectangle bordered by Mason Street, Grinfield Street, Smithdown Lane and Paddington. Their full extent is unknown and many are still blocked by rubble. They encompass a range of designs and sizes, from vast chambers to spaces inaccessible by an average human. The &quot;Banqueting Hall&quot; is around long and up to high, while the largest &quot;Paddington&quot; chamber is shorter but an impressive deep. Still larger excavations, such as the vaulted &quot;Great Tunnel&quot; seen by James Stonehouse and Charles Hand and noted on the Army surveys, have yet to be rediscovered.

==Purpose of the tunnels==
The purpose of the excavations has been the subject of widespread speculation. According to Stonehouse&#x27;s near-contemporary account, Williamson was secretive about his motives, leading to a great deal of speculative local folklore. Upon hearing that Stonehouse planned to publish his research on Williamson&#x27;s excavations, Williamson&#x27;s friend, the artist Cornelius Henderson, threatened to sue Stonehouse both for libel and trespass, leading to the paper&#x27;s suppression for some years.

The most commonly related explanation is that they were a philanthropic endeavour. Williamson&#x27;s own explanation was reputed to be that his motive was &quot;the employment of the poor&quot;; his workers &quot;all received a weekly wage and were thus enabled to enjoy the blessing of charity without the attendant curse of stifled self respect&quot;. Certain features of the tunnels appear to support this theory; there are many architectural features that seem unnecessarily decorative, hidden deep below the ground in chambers that would likely have been dimly lit and rarely seen. By way of example, at the Mason Street site a beautifully-constructed stone arch was recently uncovered in an otherwise plainly-constructed side chamber, deep underground, with no obvious explanation for its purpose. These features could be interpreted as Williamson helping his employees improve their skills.

Another suggestion, that he was a member of an extremist religious sect fearing that the end of the world was near and that the tunnels were built to provide refuge for him and his friends, originated in recent times with a casual suggestion made on a television programme. No evidence has been found to support the existence of such a sect or that Williamson, a practising member of the Church of England, belonged to one.

Stonehouse and Hand both felt the excavations were simply the largely purposeless folly of an eccentric man. However, while Stonehouse called the works &quot;stupendously useless&quot;, Hand concluded that Williamson&#x27;s philanthropic purpose was a noble one and felt he &quot;should have been both pleased and proud to have known him.&quot; Many of Williamson&#x27;s workers were said to have later found employment in railway construction with the skills they had learned.

More recent research by academics at Edge Hill University has concluded that the &#x27;tunnels&#x27; were in fact the result of work by Williamson to restore ground levels after quarrying. Most of the excavations are directly within a band of high-quality sandstone and show clear signs of having been carried out using established quarrying techniques designed to produce single large pieces of stone suitable for building use. In addition, the cross-sections of the works produced by the 1881 survey reveal a typical stone quarry profile. The apparently aimless nature of the excavations was likely a reflection of the work following the best &quot;seam&quot; of stone, avoiding imperfections and master joints. The tunnels had, therefore, originally been unregulated &quot;slot quarries&quot; for sandstone, used for prestige buildings in the rapidly-expanding Liverpool of the Georgian era, and by subsequently vaulting them over Williamson was able to restore ground levels, facilitating his extensive housing developments on the site.

While during Williamson&#x27;s lifetime it was locally rumoured that he was earning large sums from unlicensed quarrying, Williamson had apparently claimed that he made little money, using extracted sandstone largely within his own properties. It seems possible that his secrecy was at least partly driven by a need to conceal his avoidance of both large amounts of income tax and mineral rights duties due to the West Derby Waste Commission from the sale of sandstone. Knowledge of the latter dealings may have been the reason behind Henderson&#x27;s threat to sue James Stonehouse. Despite retiring from the tobacco trade in 1818, Williamson left an estate valued at £40,000 – the equivalent of around £3.3 million in 2019 – and it appears that a large proportion of this income must have come from his excavations and subsequent property development.

==The Joseph Williamson Society and Heritage Centre==
The Joseph Williamson Society was founded in 1989. It was incorporated as a private limited company in 1996 and acquired charitable status in 1997. Its aim is to promote interest in the life and philanthropic achievements of Joseph Williamson and takes the form of talks, tours, publications and educational visits. In autumn 2002, after much excavation, removal of rubble and renovation, one of the three sections of the site, the Stable Yard section, was opened to the public as the Williamson Tunnels Heritage Centre () under the trusteeship of the Joseph Williamson Society.

Visitors are taken on a guided tour which includes the south tunnel and the double tunnel and various artefacts are on view including some of the items which have been uncovered in the excavations. A programme of events and entertainments is organised on the site. The entry to the heritage centre was formerly part of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Stable Yard which closed in 1993. The stable was again home for a horse for a while in the early 2000’s when &quot;Pop&quot; took residence in 2003.

=== Public access ===
The Heritage Centre allows visitors to see a substantial section of the tunnels, including the impressive &quot;Double Tunnel&quot;. They are open Tuesday-Sunday during the summer months (Thursday-Sunday in Winter) with no advance booking required. The centre is also used as a unique venue for live music and events, as well as being available for use as location for filming and training.

==The Friends of Williamson&#x27;s Tunnels (FoWT)==
The Friends of Williamson&#x27;s Tunnels (FoWT) is a registered charity, managed by a board of trustees and committed to exploring, excavating and preserving the tunnels, with the work of excavation carried out by volunteers.

FoWT&#x27;s main base on Mason Street is the site of Joseph Williamson&#x27;s house, largely demolished except for a small section of the facade which remains standing. However, excavations there have uncovered an extensive portion of the site below ground level, as well as numerous tunnels branching off in various directions at different depths. Beneath the basement area is a large chamber known as the &quot;Banqueting Hall&quot;, which gained its nickname from oft-repeated stories of Williamson holding lavish banquets for his most loyal friends, though it is highly unlikely the space was ever used for this purpose. As of 2019 the &quot;Banqueting Hall&quot; has been completely cleared of spoil, but excavations continue in newly discovered tunnels leading off from the main chamber.

A second section of tunnels is accessed from the &quot;Paddington&quot; site, comprising a series of underground galleries on several levels, leading to a large vaulted chamber approximately high from floor to ceiling. The floor of this chamber is approximately below ground level and was cleared in 2016 after several years of excavation.

The sites have been used as a filming location, and have appeared in several documentaries featuring the tunnels and FoWT volunteers. The group has been featured in several news items, including domestic TV channels like the BBC and ITV.

=== Public access ===

The general public can visit the &quot;Paddington&quot; site with free guided tours on Wednesdays and Sundays, while the Mason Street site can be accessed by FoWT members. Members can also go to regular historical talks and other events.

==In fiction==
* In Series 13 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, entitled &quot;Doctor Who: Flux&quot;, the Williamson Tunnels, as well as Joseph Williamson and James Stonehouse, are featured. In the story, with digging set in the 1820s, Williamson seems to be aware of &quot;the cataclysmic, the impossible&quot; lying ahead, which in 2021 prove to be the unknown force the Flux, tearing through the universe, reducing everything it touches to nothing. Williamson appears several times throughout the series, appearing in locations and time periods he couldn&#x27;t have naturally reached; the penultimate episode reveals that the tunnels somehow contain portals across time and space, which Williamson has been exploring in an attempt to find a way to stop the Flux. The portals are used by the Thirteenth Doctor and her allies to move through time and space as well as a hiding place for the resistance against the Sontaran invasion. After both the Flux and the Sontarans are defeated, one of the portals is used to exile a deposed dictator called the Grand Serpent to a small asteroid.

* Joseph Williamson&#x27;s life and the building of the Williamson tunnels have been dramatised by Liverpool-based playwright and screenwriter Karen Brown in her stage and radio play &quot;The King of Edge Hill&quot;. An examination of the point at which philanthropy turns to obsession, the radio version of the play was broadcast on Radio 4 on March 21, 2000 to considerable acclaim. The stage version played at Liverpool&#x27;s Unity Theatre in 2007, and won the HSBC award for New Playwriting Talent’ and ‘The Echo Arts award for best New Play.

<text>Ben Folds Five is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Ben Folds Five, released on August 8, 1995. A non-traditional rock album, it featured a sound that excluded lead guitars completely. The album was released on the small independent label Passenger Records, owned by Caroline Records, a subsidiary of Virgin/EMI. &quot;Ben Folds Five&quot; received positive reviews, and spawned five singles. The record failed to chart, but sparked an intense bidding war eventually won by Sony Music. Several live versions of songs originally released on &quot;Ben Folds Five&quot; reappeared later as b-sides or on compilations.

==Reception==

&quot;Ben Folds Five&quot; received positive reviews from &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;. Michael Gallucci praised the album as &quot;a potent, and extremely fun collection of postmodern rock ditties that comes off as a pleasantly workable combination of Tin Pan Alley showmanship, Todd Rundgren-style power pop, and myriad alt-rock sensibilities.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; selected &quot;Boxing&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;. &quot;The Record&quot; concluded that the &quot;performances are often mannered, the arrangements busy and tiring, and Folds&#x27;s Joe Jackson Redux isn&#x27;t anything close to the Bold New Sound it has been trumpeted as.&quot;

<text>Nancy Bird Walton, (16 October 1915 – 13 January 2009) was a pioneering Australian aviator, known as &quot;The Angel of the Outback&quot;, and the founder and patron of the Australian Women Pilots&#x27; Association.

In the 1930s, she became a fully qualified pilot at the age of 19 to become the youngest Australian woman to gain a pilot&#x27;s license.

==Early life==
Born in Kew, New South Wales, Australia on 16 October 1915 as Nancy Bird, she was educated at Brighton College, Manly. Bird wanted to fly almost as soon as she could walk. As a teenager during the Depression in Australia, Nancy Bird found herself in the same position as many other children of the time, leaving school at 13 to assist her family. In 1933, at the age of 18, her passion drove her to take flying lessons. Sir Charles Kingsford Smith, who was the first man to fly across the mid-Pacific, had just opened a pilots&#x27; school near Sydney, and she was among his first pupils. Most women who learned to fly did so for recreation, but Bird planned to fly for a living, which had never been achieved by a woman before.

==Aviation career==
When she was awarded a commercial pilot&#x27;s license at the age of 19, through a legacy of A£200 from a great aunt, plus money loaned from her father (which she paid back), Bird bought her first aircraft, a de Havilland Gipsy Moth. Soon after, Bird and her friend, Peggy McKillop, took off on a barnstorming tour, dropping in on country fairs and giving joyrides to people who had never seen an aircraft before, let alone a female pilot.

While touring, Bird met Reverend Stanley Drummond. He wanted her to help set up a flying medical service in outback New South Wales. In 1935, she was hired to operate the service, named the Royal Far West Children&#x27;s Health Scheme. Bird&#x27;s own Gipsy Moth was used as an air ambulance. She bought a better-equipped aircraft and began covering territory, including Queensland, not yet reached by the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. She told others that it was rewarding but lonely work.

In 1936, Nancy Bird entered an air race from Adelaide to Brisbane, and won the Ladies&#x27; Trophy. In 1938, she decided to have a long break from flying. A Dutch airline company (KLM) invited her to do some promotional work in Europe, where she stayed for a couple of years. She returned to Australia soon after World War II broke out. She began training women in skills needed to back up the men flying in the Royal Australian Air Force.

In 1950, she founded the Australian Women Pilots&#x27; Association (AWPA), where she remained president for five years. In 1958, she decided to return to flying after a hiatus of over twenty years. Nancy-Bird Walton became Patron of the AWPA in 1983, following the death of Lady Casey, the original Patron. Walton purchased Lady Casey&#x27;s Cessna 180 which had been named &quot;Lady Casey&quot; by Baron Casey.

==Recognition and honours==
Throughout her life, Walton was notable for her support of charities and people in need. As a result, she was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1966. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1990. She was the inspiration for generations of female pilots. She was never involved in an accident, despite the risks of early aviation.

The Nancy-Bird Walton Memorial trophy, sponsored by the family, is presented by the Australian Women Pilots&#x27; Association for the &quot;most noteworthy contribution to aviation by a woman of Australasia&quot;.

The National Trust of Australia declared her an Australian Living Treasure in 1997, and in 2001 she was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women.

The first Airbus A380 (VH-OQA) delivered to Australian airline Qantas was named in her honour. Her name on the A380 was originally written &quot;Nancy Bird Walton&quot;, but Qantas respected her preference for the hyphenation that her late husband used (&quot;Nancy-Bird&quot;), and the hyphen was added before the aircraft&#x27;s naming, shortly after she was aboard the ceremonial flight above Sydney. This aircraft was operating flight QF32 when it suffered a serious uncontained engine failure after takeoff from Singapore in 2010; coincidentally, Walton wrote the first officer&#x27;s reference when he first joined Qantas as a pilot.

One of her last main interviews was for the feature-length documentary film &quot;Flying Sheilas&quot; which provided an insight into her life along with seven other Australian female pilots.

In March 2019, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that the new Western Sydney Airport will be named Western Sydney International (Nancy-Bird Walton) Airport.

==Personal life==
She was 24 when she married an Englishman, Charles Walton, and had two children. He preferred to call her &quot;Nancy-Bird&quot; rather than &quot;Nancy&quot;, and she became generally known as &quot;Nancy-Bird Walton&quot;.

On 10 September 2008, shortly before her death, Walton conducted a 45-minute interview for the one-hour documentary.

On 13 January 2009, Nancy Bird Walton died at the age of 93.

<text>Radio Scotland was an offshore pirate radio station broadcasting on 1241 kHz mediumwave (242 metres), created by Tommy Shields in 1965. The station was on the former lightship L.V. &quot;Comet&quot;, which had been fitted out as a radio station in Guernsey using RCA technology and engineers, it was anchored at locations off Scotland, usually outside territorial waters.

==History==
The station began on 31 December 1965 and featured DJs including Paul Young, Richard Park, Stuart Henry and Jack McLaughlin with a céilidh programme that promised to tickle the &quot;tartan tonsils&quot;. Later disc-jockeys included John Kerr, Tony Allan, Ben Healy, Mark Wesley (as Mark West), Alan Black, David Kinnaird, Charlie Whyte, Pete Bowman, Larry Marshall, Bryan Vaughan, Mel Howard, Roger Gale (now Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons), Eddie White, Drew Hamlyn, Jimmy Mack, Cathy Spence, Stevie Merike and Brian McKenzie (as Brian Webb). Its headquarters, Radio Scotland House, was a building at Cranworth Street, Hillhead in Glasgow. Cranworth Street also made taped programmes - using 1/4&quot; magnetic tape - which were taken to the ship by tender.

The &quot;Comet&quot; was initially off Dunbar on the east coast and had strong coverage of Edinburgh, but not as clearly in Glasgow. Shields moved the ship in April 1966 to Troon off Arran on the west coast, but it had no engine so it had to be towed. Adding to expense was that the station remained on air, meaning a longer route outside territorial waters.

The anchorages off the west coast of Scotland were found to be within territorial waters and the company was fined £80, bringing a move to Ballywalter, off County Down, Northern Ireland, the station changing its name to Radio Scotland and Ireland. Then RTÉ claimed the station was causing adjacent channel interference to its Dublin transmitter on 1250 kHz. Transmissions to the east of Scotland were worse from this location, so Shields took the ship to off Fife Ness and the Isle of May. As well as giving eastern Scotland a strong signal, the &quot;water run&quot; meant the signal didn&#x27;t hit land until Grangemouth in Stirlingshire, about 20 miles (32 km) from Glasgow. So the Central Belt at last had a listenable signal. Peter Alex&#x27;s 1966 book &quot;Who&#x27;s Who In Pop Radio&quot; claimed that as well as covering Scotland and Northern Ireland, the station&#x27;s reception area included the east coast of England down to Cambridge.&#x27;

The station was popular in Scotland with the &#x27;242 Clan&#x27; fan club&#x27; and &quot;242&quot; monthly magazine. It was also seen as profitable, and one of the &#x27;big six&#x27; pirate stations, along with Caroline South, Caroline North, Radio London, Radio 390 and Radio 270.

The station closed on 14 August 1967 with the Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967. Shields had repeatedly lobbied the Government to exempt Radio Scotland and wanted terms under which the station might continue legally. One of his arguments was that the station broadcast into areas where it was not possible to receive BBC radio. Shields died just six months after the station&#x27;s closure, aged 49.

The majority of the crew and presenters were at a party in Glasgow to say farewell to Radio Scotland on the last night. It was left to Andy Main, electrical engineer and occasional late night DJ, to give the last transmission and put Radio Scotland off air. Prior to the recorded &#x27;last hour&#x27; show which finished at 11.59 pm, Tony Allan and Mark West presented a programme talking about past shows and DJs and playing their signature tunes.

Many presenters went to other stations, including BBC Radio 1, Radio Caroline, Radio Luxembourg, Radio Clyde and BBC Radio Scotland.

<text>Stuart Baird (born 14 January 1947) is an English film editor, producer, and director who is mainly associated with action films. He has edited over thirty major motion pictures.

==Life and career==
Baird has had an extended collaboration with director Richard Donner. For Baird&#x27;s work on &quot;Superman&quot; in 1978, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing. He received another nomination for editing &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; (1988). Prior to his working relationship with Richard Donner, Baird worked as assistant director and assistant editor on different projects before editing Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;. Baird worked with Russell on five major motion pictures. He edited &quot;Tommy&quot;, &quot;Lisztomania&quot;, and &quot;Valentino&quot; and served as associate producer on Russell&#x27;s &quot;Altered States&quot;. He also worked as assistant editor on Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot;, (1971).

After his Oscar-nominated work on &quot;Gorillas in the Mist&quot; in 1988 and his work with Richard Donner on &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;, he accepted a position as full-time staff editor at Warner Bros. in 1989. With Warner Bros., he supervised the editing on such films as &quot;Die Hard 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991).

The first two movies Baird directed were studio pictures produced and distributed by Warner Bros.; where he had served as Editor Supervisor. He has directed three films: &quot;Executive Decision&quot; (1996), &quot;U.S. Marshals&quot; (1998), and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002). He was the editor and executive producer of &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001). Baird edited the Columbia Pictures thriller &quot;Vantage Point&quot;.

In the film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, Baird also voiced the &quot;Scimitar&quot; computer. To get the job directing &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, Baird performed re-cuts on &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; and &quot;&quot; for Paramount Pictures. Jerry Goldsmith was the composer for all of the Baird-directed films.

<doc id="1174084" wikidata="Q3857874" url="?curid=1174084" title="Milford on Sea">
<text>Milford on Sea, often hyphenated, is a large coastal village and civil parish in the New Forest district, on the Hampshire coast, England. The parish had a population of 4,660 at the 2011 census and is centred about south of Lymington. Tourism and businesses for quite prosperous retirees as well as the care sector make up large parts of its economy. Businesses include restaurants, cafés, tea rooms, small shops, garden centres, pubs and camping/lodge/caravan parks, bed-and-breakfasts and a few luxury hotels. Shops cluster on its small high street, which fronts a village green. The western cliffs are accessed by flights of steps. In common with the flatter coast by the more commercial and eastern part of Milford, they have car parks with some facilities, which, along with many apartment blocks and houses, have close views of The Needles, which are the main, large chalk rocks immediately next to the Isle of Wight.

Its western coast is a large bank of shingle below green cliffs. Bathing, when seas are calm, is favourable as tides are relatively muted for the coast at this point and thin sandbanks are nearby at lower water. The eastern part of the place culminates in Hurst Castle, Hurst Point which is a 16th-century defensive fort with later modifications, which has a museum, visitor tour rides and amenities for tourists.

Much of the land of the parish has been recognised and protected from dense habitation by a surrounding green belt buffer zone of land, recognising its heath soil associated with the New Forest, its biodiverse wet woodland in the west (a local nature reserve which hosts badgers, fish and many bird species) and various water type marshes including an RSPB reserve in the east.

== History ==
Milford began as a Saxon settlement, and the name simply means &quot;mill ford&quot;. At the time of the Domesday Book of 1086 there were two separate estates in Milford, one held by Aelfric Small, and the other land with no villeins or cottars noted held by Wulfgar. At a later date three separate manors were evolved from these estates and were eventually known by the names of Milford Montagu, Milford Barnes, and Milford Baddesley.

The manor of Milford Montagu, which was held of the lords of Christchurch, seems to have originated in an estate held by William Spileman at his death in 1291. In the late 14th century, it was part of the lands of William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. In 1428 Thomas, the 4th Earl, died possessed of the manor, and was succeeded by his daughter Alice. By 1580 the manor had passed out of the hands of the Montagu family, and it was acquired in 1610 by Sir Thomas Gorges, who was succeeded by his son Sir Edward, Baron Gorges of Dundalk. In 1638 he sold it to Edward Hopgood. At the end of the 18th century, the manor was purchased by Admiral William Cornwallis.

The manor of Milford Barnes originally belonged to Christchurch Priory. After the Dissolution a twenty-one years&#x27; lease of &quot;the site of the manor with the appurtenances and all land and fisheries belonging, together with 20 acres in Shorefield,&quot; was in 1557 granted to John Wavell, and in 1574 a similar lease was granted to John Rowe. Sir Thomas Gorges owned the estate in 1611, and from that time its descent was the same as that of the manor of Milford Montagu.

The manor of Milford Baddesley originated in an estate held in Milford by the Knights Templar. In the time of King John, Hugh de Whitwell and his son William granted land at Milford to William Mackerel which he granted to the Templars, for their preceptory of Baddesley. It was held of Christchurch manor. On the suppression of the order of Knights Templar this estate was granted, about 1312 to the Knights Hospitaller, to whom it continued to belong until the Dissolution of 1540. It was acquired by Robert Rickman around 1609, in whose family it remained into the 18th century. In 1829 Mary Anna Theresa Whitby, who had inherited Admiral Cornwallis&#x27; estates purchased Milford Baddesley, uniting all three estates.

=== Newlands ===

Around 1800 Admiral William Cornwallis leased then bought as freehold the small Newlands estate in Milford. This included the manors of Milford Montagu(e) and Milford Barnes. He was joined at Newlands by his friend and fellow naval officer Captain John Whitby and John&#x27;s wife Mary Anna Theresa. John died in 1806, but Mary and her infant daughter Theresa stayed on looking after Cornwallis into his old age. On Cornwallis&#x27;s death in 1819, Mary and her daughter inherited his fortune.

In 1829 Mary Whitby purchased Milford Baddesley, re-uniting the main manors of the parish covering about half of its area, thus about . Her daughter Theresa, who inherited these, married Frederick Richard West, and they used Newlands as one of their residences. Their son, born in 1835, bore the name of William Cornwallis-West. He inherited Newlands in 1886, and attempted to convert Milford into a premier seaside resort, changing the name of the village to Milford-on-Sea. His plans included the construction of a pier, railway station, public baths, health spa, and golf course. The scheme failed primarily due to a lack of funds and market interest, but it gave Milford a layout and ordered development that lasted well into the 20th century. The other surviving element of this plan is Westover Hall. It was built in 1897 originally as a private villa for Alexander Siemens. It was later converted to a hotel. William&#x27;s son George Cornwallis-West inherited Newlands in 1917 and, amid bankruptcy proceedings, sold it three years later.

=== Modern times ===

As recently as 1800 the parish of Milford was entirely inland, being separated from the sea by a narrow strip of coast-line which was an extension eastwards of Hordle parish. Coastal erosion, as well as the growth of the village to the south and west, meant that by 1900 Milford bordered the sea. Milford was part of a combined Milford and Pennington Parish Council after 1894, and then became a separate Milford Parish Council when Pennington was separated from it in 1911. However, in 1932 Milford was absorbed into an enlarged Lymington Borough, only re-emerging as a separate parish in 1974.

With the advent of increasing car ownership, especially after the Second World War, the village expanded rapidly as a resort and as a place in which to retire. Blocks of flats were constructed along the clifftop in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, and additional housing was built inland.

From most of the coast on a clear night, the conurbation of Christchurch, Bournemouth and Poole is visible from the coastal road and adjoining promenade and the brighter stars; in daytime the view extends in most weather conditions to the white cliffs and further part of the headland beyond of the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in Dorset. At the closer level Milford is on a broad sub-bay (Christchurch Bay), ended by the Bournemouth Bay headland and entrance to the harbour of Christchurch, which thus juts out little from this vantage point, Hengistbury Head, traversed by a regular foot ferry in most seasons.

To the east in the parish, less than a mile from the nucleated village centre, is Keyhaven which has a boatyard and half of the Lymington-Keyhaven nature reserve (or Marshes): a raised sea wall path around migratory bird shallow lakes, cattle/rabbit meadow and diverse wetland including salt marsh. To its south Keyhaven Harbour is a natural lagoon extension of the biome, west of which Sturt Pond is its estuarine habitat extension.

South of the lagoons leading to the harbour and close to town centre Sturt Pond is Hurst Spit, of almost all shingle, from the apex of which – Hurst Point – men stationed at Hurst Castle watched over and could bombard the Solent&#x27;s western access. A seasonal ferry makes the trip across the lagoon/harbour mouth every 20–30 minutes. This saves the walk along the beach. The beach is mainly west, as cliffs of Milford rise, and is safe to walk so the accessible length of beach (including the southeast side of the spit) is , to Barton-on-Sea Golf Course where the way, above and below cliff, become liable to closures from erosion.

The beach has varying size shingle, beyond which is some inter-tidal sand. Facing this and the broad clifftop/lower town residential promenade are the Needles and rest of the north-western Isle of Wight.

== All Saints&#x27; Church ==
The oldest building in Milford is All Saints&#x27; Church. The earliest parts of the structure are probably true Norman-era (early 12th century) work from a preceding church. A south aisle was added around 1170. In the 13th century the church was more than trebled in size and brought to its present plan. This work, which occurred in stages, included the north façade and tower, the chancel, and north and south chapels. The work was funded by Isabel de Forz, 8th Countess of Devon. The tower has a later, short recessed spire. The north aisle was rebuilt in the mid-1850s and the church&#x27;s current pulpit was added in around 1920. William Saville-Kent is buried here, his grave decorated with a variety of fossilised sponges.

The ecclesiastical parish still includes the chapelry or united benefice of Everton and the locality of Keyhaven where water dominates the land in the east.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the name of Milford exists. At the 2011 Census the population of this ward was 4,838.
The district, for most hard communal infrastructure, education and social care (amongst other functions) is in Hampshire County Council&#x27;s area.

== Events and festivals ==
*In February the place&#x27;s Food Week takes place.
*Milford holds a May Day festival each year.
*In June–July there is a music (with many live bands across many venues) and arts festival. 
*In August the town holds a carnival.

== Parish Vision 2020 ==

This plan is a statement of community ambitions, based on research and public consultation. It builds on the 2002 Village Design Statement which dealt essentially with land use issues.

Strategic objectives:
* Improving housing and employment opportunities, particularly for young people
* Improving the provision of social, cultural and recreational facilities.
* Enhancing and protecting the natural environment.
* Maintaining and developing parish facilities for tourism and business opportunities.
* Improving transport links with hinterland communities.
* Making the village centre safer for pedestrians whilst protecting its special character.

== Notable residents ==

* Christopher Airay (1601–1670), logician, was vicar here in the 17th century, from about 1646.
* Clement Reid (1853-1916), geologist, proponent of Doggerland, died in the village.
* William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield (1877–1963), philanthropist and industrialist, owned a house on the clifftop, 1 Park Lane, which is now a hotel.
* Margaret Macadam (1902–1991), artist and illustrator, widow of Francis Beart, spent her last years in the village.
* Frank Wootton (1914–1998), 20th century aviation artist, was born in the village.
* David Peach (born 1951), Gillingham, Southampton (including in FA Cup Final: 1976), Swindon Town, Leyton Orient (and England under-23) footballer.
* Frances Fisher (born 1952), Hollywood actress in films such as &quot;Titanic&quot;, was born here.

<doc id="1174091" wikidata="Q513471" url="?curid=1174091" title="Game over">
<text>&quot;Game over&quot; is a message in video games which informs the player that their play session has ended, usually because the player has reached a loss condition. It also sometimes appears at the successful completion of a session, especially in games designed for arcades, after the player has exhausted the game&#x27;s supply of new challenges. The phrase has since been turned into quasi-slang, usually describing an event that will cause significant harm, injury, bad luck, or even death to a person. However, since the turn of the century, it has largely fallen out of fashion in favor of unlimited lives and endless checkpoints with autosaves, although it very much remains the norm in arcades, as they require payment inserts. 

==History==
The phrase was used as early as 1950 in devices such as electro-mechanical pinball machines, which would light up the phrase with a lamp (lightbulb). Before the advent of home consoles and personal computing, arcades were the predominant platform for playing games, which required users to deposit a token or coin into an arcade game machine to play. Most early arcade video games typically had the game end when a timer ran out, with shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) later popularizing a game over triggered by the player getting killed by enemies (either by being shot or enemies reaching the player), with the player given a finite number of lives before the game ends.

During the golden age of arcade video games, players would usually be given a finite number of lives (or attempts) to progress through the game, the exhaustion of which would usually result in the display of the message &quot;Game over&quot; indicating that the game had ended. The phrase might also be followed by the message &quot;Play Again?&quot; and a prompt asking the player to insert additional tokens to prevent the game from terminating and instead allowing the player to continue their progress. The message can also be seen flashing on certain arcade games while in attract mode, until a player inserts a credit; at this point the message would change to the number of credits inserted and &quot;Press 1 or 2 player start&quot;, or some variation thereof.

As these games were ported to home consoles, the &quot;Game over&quot; screen and &quot;Continue?&quot; prompt remained, but often required only the press of a button to keep the game going; while the video game industry shifted away from being arcade-focused to being home gaming-focused, the inclusion of such a screen was no longer as critical since it offered no financial benefit. However, the concept of Game Over remained imbued in the medium thereafter as a way to add an element of risk: a player who is unsuccessful at carrying out the game&#x27;s objective (possibly repeatedly) will be faced with such a screen and be forced to start over from either the beginning of the game or level, or to a previous, saved state.

Certain games ask players with no more lives to continue or to choose &quot;game over&quot; in a menu. &quot;Kamen no Ninja Akakage&quot; released in 1988 by Toei for the Famicom has &quot;game over&quot; on top of &quot;continue&quot; with a cursor to be properly positioned to get the desired choice. A number of free-to-play mobile games, however, can and have profited from a continue mechanic to pressure players into investing some money into gathering resources or currency needed to buy a continue to prevent an effort to accomplish something important in the game (such as beating a high score or clearing a very difficult level) from being completely negated by a game over.

With the development of the aforementioned save function (complemented by the less popular password system, which is now seen as archaic), the Game Over message has become less common as players are allowed to respawn at a previous state of the game, which has been stored in memory either through a player deliberately saving the game or reaching a checkpoint (which causes the game to save automatically). Many modern games do not technically &quot;end&quot; until they are completed, and although &quot;Game over&quot; screens remain present in many of them in some form or another, it is uncommon for them to signify a forced return to the beginning of the game, and only marginally more common for them to signify a substantial loss of progress. Roguelikes are the most common exception to this rule; permadeath is often a staple of the genre.

==Variations==

&quot;Game over&quot; has seen many variations. For instance in &quot;Little King&#x27;s Story&quot;, the message &quot;LIFE OVER&quot; appears upon the death of the player&#x27;s character. &quot;Nights into Dreams...&quot; and &quot;&quot; use &quot;NIGHT OVER&quot;. &quot;Antarctic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; use &quot;TIME OVER&quot;. Screens that display at equivalent points are considered &quot;Game over&quot; screens, even if the message that is displayed is entirely different, such as &quot;YOU ARE DEAD&quot; used in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, and &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;, &quot;YOU DIED&quot; seen in &quot;Dark Souls&quot;, &quot;Cuphead&quot;, and &quot;Minecraft&quot; (though &quot;Minecraft&quot; uses &quot;Game over&quot; if one dies in hardcore mode), &quot;GOOD NIGHT&quot; seen in &quot;Klonoa&quot; and &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot;. The 2020 Nintendo 3DS game &quot;The Queen TV-Game 2&quot; uses an expletive to parody player frustration. The 1980 arcade game &quot;Missile Command&quot; uses &quot;The End&quot;, a game over screen that is usually seen upon achieving victory. Red Dead Redemption and its prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, both simply use &quot;DEAD&quot; upon the player&#x27;s death. Another variation includes &quot;THE WITCH HUNTS ARE OVER&quot; used in the &quot;Bayonetta&quot; series, &quot;YOU WERE SLAIN&quot; in &quot;Terraria&quot;, and &quot;DRIVER DOWN&quot; in &quot;Hill Climb Racing&quot;.

Some games give specific loss condition messages, pattern, screen, and sequence exclusive to a level, mission, game mode, or situation. For example, &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot; give game over dialog boxes saying &quot;All your pet zombies have perished!&quot;, &quot;You survived for (number of flags completed) flags!!&quot;, &quot;You lost all your zombies!&quot;, and &quot;You made it to a streak of (number of streaks that the player completed)&quot; in Zombiquarium mini-game, Last Stand (mini-game and puzzle), I, Zombie finite levels, and I, Zombie and Vasebreaker Endless, respectively, with them only play the game over music which can be skipped by restarting or exiting the level to lose progress on that attempt while the music plays and not show the normal &quot;THE ZOMBIES ATE YOUR BRAINS!&quot; cutscene for Last Stand and Vasebreaker Endless, and afterwards the game becomes silent until the player restarts or exits. Survival Mode of the said game, however, have the normal losing sequence and cutscene plays, with only the game over result dialog box differs where it says &quot;You survived for (number of flags completed) flag(s) before dying a gruesome zombie death!!!&quot; instead of &quot;GAME OVER&quot; on most game versions (except mobile where both text are shown in the dialog box).

==Outside video gaming==

The phrase is occasionally used to indicate the end of an argument or process in real life. In January 2011, protesters and rioters in several North African and Middle Eastern countries used the slogan &quot;Game over&quot; on banners to express their anti-government sentiments.

&quot;Game over&quot; is also sometimes used as a phrase to concede defeat, as for example in the movie &quot;Aliens&quot; where one of the protagonists, Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton), shouts, &quot;Game over, man. Game over!&quot; after the dropship meant to rescue him and his expedition is destroyed. Paxton&#x27;s use of the phrase was included in shortened form in the SNES game adaptation of &quot;Alien 3&quot;, although the Hudson character did not appear in the film. The &quot;Game Over&quot; quote is heard in full after the final ball is drained in Zen Studios&#x27; virtual pinball adaptation of &quot;Aliens&quot;. The &quot;game over&quot; line was not in the &quot;Aliens&quot; script, but was ad libbed by Paxton.

The phrase is also used various times in the &quot;Saw&quot; movie series, because of the antagonist&#x27;s penchant for referring to the traps he creates as &quot;games&quot;.

Some gamebooks utilize this phrase as well. Each book in the &quot;Nintendo Adventure Book&quot; series has only one good ending, with all of the bad ones saying &quot;Game Over&quot;.

<text>The Fairfax County Public Schools system (FCPS) is a school division in the U.S. commonwealth of Virginia. It is a branch of the Fairfax County government, which administers public schools in Fairfax County and the City of Fairfax. FCPS&#x27;s headquarters is located near Falls Church.

With 188,887 students enrolled as of 2019, FCPS is the largest public school system in Virginia and the 11th-largest school district in the nation. The school division has been led by Division Superintendent Michelle Reid since July 2022.

==History==
===19th century===


The public school system in Fairfax County, Virginia, was created following the end of the Civil War with the adoption by Virginia of the Reconstruction-era state constitution in 1870, which provided for the first time that free public education was a constitutional right. The first superintendent of schools for Fairfax County was Thomas M. Moore, who was sworn in on September 26, 1870. At the time of its creation, the Fairfax County Public Schools system consisted of 41 schools, 28 white, and 13 colored schools.

In 1886, Milton D. Hall was appointed superintendent, and he served for 44 years until his retirement in 1929.

===20th century===

Fairfax County Schools, like most school systems in the south, schools practiced &quot;de jure&quot; segregation. There were local elementary schools for black students but no high schools. Although Fairfax was a densely populated area, there were proportionately few black high school students. Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun, Arlington and Fauquier Counties shared the high school for black students. The school was centrally located between the counties in Manassas. Others attended high schools in Washington, D.C., where many had relatives. Those schools were Armstrong High School, Cardozo High School, Dunbar High School, and Phelps Vocational Center in Washington, D.C. In 1951, Fairfax County, at the request of residents for a black high school, began construction of the Luther Jackson School.
 The opening coincided with the Brown decision passed in 1954.

In 1954, FCPS had 42 elementary schools and 6 high schools. That year, the Luther Jackson High School, the first high school for black students, opened in Falls Church.

In 1954, the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ordered an end to racial segregation. In response, the Commonwealth of Virginia immediately enacted legislation to stop the desegregation process, took control of all the schools in Virginia, and resorted to closing school systems attempting to desegregate. When Arlington County announced an early attempt at a desegregation plan, its school board was fired by the State Board of Education.

In 1955, the Fairfax County School Board renamed a &quot;Committee on Desegregation&quot; as the &quot;Committee on Segregation&quot; after a petition and threat of litigation from a civic group called &quot;Virginia Citizens&#x27; Committee for Better Schools&quot;.

After the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision, Daniel Duke, author of &quot;Education Empire&quot;, wrote: &quot;Whether local school systems such as Fairfax County, left to their own, would have moved forward to implement desegregation in the late fifties will never be known. Richmond removed any possibility of local option...&quot;

It was recognized in court cases that it was the state who was running the show, not the county. The ruling in a 1964 decision stated, &quot;Prior to the Brown decision Fairfax County maintained a dual school system: one for Negro students; one for all other races. Shortly thereafter the placement of all children in the Fairfax County schools was taken from the local School Board and vested in the state Pupil Placement Board. The assignment of students remained with the state Board until the 1961–62 school year, at which time placement responsibilities were reinvested in the local School Board.&quot; Fairfax County began their desegregation efforts shortly thereafter.
As early as 1955, it was noted that in the Virginia General Assembly: Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley Plans and called for even more radical legislation. Virginia&#x27;s 10th district was the only congressional district to vote against the Gray Plan. Delegate Boatwright also introduced another bill aimed at correcting the unorthodox views of the northern Virginians. Boatwright&#x27;s legislation would have prohibited certain federal employees from serving on school boards or holding other local offices. The point of this bill, called the &quot;Boatwright Bill&quot;, was without a doubt aimed at Northern Virginia and the School Boards. Boatwright said his bill affected all Virginia communities but admitted Northern Virginia was most affected. The reason for the bill was that they felt that Federal Employees were in support of the Federal government&#x27;s position on integration. The seven-member Fairfax County School Board included four Federal employees.

In &quot;Blackwell v. Fairfax County School Board&quot; in 1960, black plaintiffs charged that the Fairfax grade-a-year plan was discriminatory and dilatory. Fifteen black children had been refused admission to white schools because they did not fall within the prescribed grades of the School Board&#x27;s assignment plan. The plaintiffs contended successfully that the speed of desegregation was too slow under the school board&#x27;s plan. District Judge Albert V. Bryan did not categorically rule out such plans in accepting the plaintiff&#x27;s argument. Instead, he emphasized that they must be judged according to the community&#x27;s character. Since the black school population of Fairfax County was less than four percent, Bryan considered the fear of racial friction an unacceptable justification for such a cautious desegregation plan.

The Civil Rights Commission report of 1962 found that &quot;Every sign indicates that the communities in northern Virginia will be the first in the State to reach compliance with the mandate in the School Segregation Cases.&quot; Ultimately, Fairfax County was one of the first school systems in the country to be awarded funds to aid with desegregation because of their efforts to implement a desegregated system.

The Fairfax County School Board voted to switch from a 7–5 to a 6–2–4 grade level configuration in 1958, necessitating the creation of what were then called intermediate schools for students in grades 7 and 8. By the time the first eight intermediate schools opened in the Fall of 1960, they were already over their 1000 student capacities.

In the fall of 1960, the first black students were admitted to newly desegregated public schools. Jerald R. Betz and Raynard Wheeler were enrolled at the Belvedere Elementary School in Falls Church, and Gwendolyn Brooks was enrolled at Cedar Lane Elementary School in Vienna.

The changeover to the 6–2–4 plan was the last major initiative of Superintendent W. T. Woodson, who retired in 1961, having served 32 years, the second-longest tenure as head of the Fairfax County Public Schools system.

In April 1961, Wilmington, North Carolina Superintendent Earl C. Funderburk was appointed superintendent to replace Woodson.

In 1961, FCPS also began administering the schools in the City of Fairfax.

As early as 1965, Superintendent Funderburk was discussing plans to decentralize FCPS. By 1967, Funderburk had put together a plan for five area offices, each serving a portion of the county and had appointed Woodson High School Principal Robert E. Phipps and West Springfield High School Principal S. John Davis as his first two administrators that December.

Although the school board had endorsed Funderburk&#x27;s plan, they also hired the consulting firm of Cresap, McCormick &amp; Paget to conduct an audit of the system&#x27;s management organization and operations. In 1968, based on their consultant&#x27;s recommendations, the school board put a significantly modified version of the decentralization plan into effect, dividing FCPS into four areas which were, in effect, miniature school systems.

In January of the following year, Funderburk resigned, telling the school board he did not want a third term as superintendent. The school board selected Lawrence M. Watts from the Greece School District in Greece, New York to take the reins of the Fairfax County Public Schools system, which had grown during Funderburk&#x27;s tenure from 65,000 to 122,000 students, in May 1969.

In May 1970, Watts appointed Taylor M. Williams as the first black high school principal since FCPS had desegregated, placing him in charge of James Madison High School in Vienna.

Watts&#x27; appointment of Williams would be one of his final official acts. After less than a year as superintendent, Watts died, aged 44, of a heart attack at his home in Oakton in June 1970. Assistant Superintendent S. Barry Morris was named interim superintendent while the school board sought a replacement to lead the 130,000 student school system.

The board did not have to look far for its new superintendent. In September 1970, Area Superintendent S. John Davis was chosen following a nationwide search to serve the remaining 33 months of Watts&#x27; four-year term.

During the mid-1970s, Davis had difficulties dealing with the start of a demographic crash and a population shift. The student population dropped from a high of 145,385 in the 1974–75 school year to an eventual low of 122,646 in 1982–83. Additionally, families migrated from established eastern and central parts of the county to newer developments in the west and south, leading to the unenviable task of Davis having to request the closings of some schools while needing to build entirely new ones elsewhere.

In a 6–5 vote, the school board voted in May 1976 to re-institute textbook rental fees, hoping to raise an additional $1.3 million to close a projected budget shortfall. The plan was scrapped two months later, in July, when the board was able to find a $1.4 million surplus.

In 1978, Fairfax County began countywide enforcement of its 15-year-old standardized six-point letter grading scale, with a ten-point spread at the bottom of the grading range. The grading scale, initially set in 1963, provided that a score of 100–94% was an A, 93–87% a B, 86–80% a C, and 70–79% a D, with any score below 70% an F.

The county school board adopted a $279 million budget in February 1979, which included a 5.15% cost of living raise for the system&#x27;s teachers and other employees. However, this increase was only slightly more than half of the inflation rate, which was at an annual rate of 9.9% that month, and far short of the 9.4% increase FCPS employees had sought. In April 1979, the Fairfax Education Association, the professional association representing teachers in the county, adopted a work-to-the-rule action, which meant that teachers would not do any work outside of the 7.5 hours per day they were contracted for. Additionally, the FEA gave a vote of no confidence to Superintendent Davis.

The vote of no confidence was considered the main factor in Davis&#x27; decision to resign from Fairfax County Public Schools on May 18, 1979, and accept an appointment as Virginia Superintendent of Public Education from Governor John N. Dalton, despite having to take a $5,000 per year pay cut.

After Davis resigned, the Fairfax County School Board appointed Associate School Superintendent William J. Burkholder interim superintendent.

In November 1979, the school board named Orange County, Florida superintendent Lucius Linton Deck, Junior as superintendent following a four-month search. Deck had been a divisive figure during his years in Orange County, with some residents glad to see him go, while others praised him as a strong and professional leader.

Deck inherited the problem of needing to close underused schools that had first plagued Superintendent Davis. 29 elementary schools, mostly in the eastern part of the county, were studied for possible closure, but Deck&#x27;s recommendation in April 1980 was for eight schools to be closed, five more than the review panel had suggested. The following month, the school board voted to close seven of the eight schools at its May 22, 1980 meeting, a move which was met with angry hisses and boos from parents in attendance.

Fairfax County teachers&#x27; work to the rule action, which had begun in April 1979, was finally ended in May 1980.

Superintendent Linton Deck accepted a new four-year contract as Superintendent of Fairfax County Public Schools in January 1981. Shortly before accepting his new contract, Deck proposed making up a $2.75 million portion of his proposed $395 million 1982 school budget by instituting textbook rental fees for students. Although permitted by Virginia law, the plan, which included charging textbook fees from $22 for elementary school students up to $30 per year for high school students, was scrapped in the face of strong criticism.

Controversy over Deck&#x27;s handling of an investigation of recruiting violations by the Mount Vernon High School athletic department, his censure by the Fairfax Education Association for a mishandled school closing, unhappiness with his leadership style, which was characterized as &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;abrasive&quot;, and pressure from the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors angry at Deck&#x27;s proposed budget led to the school board forcing Deck to resign on June 24, 1982, only years into his four-year contract. The board appointed William J. Burkholder as acting superintendent.

At its April 25, 1991 meeting, the school board approved a plan where several intermediate schools in areas of the county with declining enrollments that had for the previous 31 years only served seventh and eighth grades would add sixth graders and become middle schools. Three intermediate schools, Glasgow, Holmes, and Poe, added sixth-grade classes.

In 1993, the four-year-old teacher merit pay was suspended due to budget cuts, and the school board voted to phase the program out completely over the next four years at its March 11 meeting.

===Special education===
FCPS took over the education of students with mental disabilities from a parent-organized cooperative in 1953. The parents had begun the program in 1950, using whatever space could be found to educate their children, but eventually asked FCPS to take control of the program.

Special education classes for mentally disabled students were expanded in 1955 to four classes for &quot;educable&quot; (those with a mental age above 7) children at Groveton, Lincolnia, Oakton, and Luther Jackson schools, and a class for &quot;trainable&quot; (those with a mental age of less than ) children at Groveton.

In recent years lawsuits have been brought by parents of students with IEPs and 504 plan against FCPS over reports that FCPS repeatedly violated and failed to provide the necessary resources provided by the student&#x27;s special education plan provided to students under federal anti discrimination laws ADA and IDEA act.

The number of lawsuits and complaints filed FCPS leading to multiple investigations by The United States Department of Education, the resulting reports from the investigations detailing how many times and how much FCPS has failed students who had IEPs and 504 plans.

===21st century===
From 1965 to 2006, the county school system was headquartered at 10700 Page Avenue in an unincorporated area of the county surrounded by the City of Fairfax. In 2006, FCPS moved all of its operations from the Burkholder Center and several other school-owned and leased offices to the office building on Gatehouse Road.

The school system has expanded to include over 196 schools and centers, including 22 high schools, three secondary schools, 23 middle schools, and 141 elementary schools. Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) also operates a fleet of over 1520 school buses, which transport 110,000 students daily. They operate on an operating budget of $2.5 billion through numerous funding sources.

FCPS is currently the largest school system in Virginia and the tenth-largest in the United States. It also boasts an average on-time graduation rate of 91.5% and an average SAT score of 1213. The school district uses an electronic visitor management system to control visitors&#x27; access at its schools.

==Debate over grading policy==
Prior to May 2009, Fairfax County Public Schools used a six-point grading scale where 94–100% was an A, 90–93% was a B+, 84–89% was a B, and so on. In 2008, however, a parent group raised concerns about whether the FCPS method of computing grades and applying weights for advanced courses adversely affected FCPS applicants for college admissions, honors program placements, and merit-based scholarship awards.

On January 2, 2009, Superintendent Jack D. Dale announced his decision on the issue, recommending changing the weights of advanced courses but maintaining the six-point grading scale. Dale stated there was no conclusive evidence the six-point grading scale is disadvantageous for the students of FCPS.

Fairfax County Public Schools worked with the parent group to conduct a joint investigation into the issue. On January 22, 2009, the FCPS School Board directed Superintendent Dale to report to it with a new version of the grading scale by March 2009. The board also approved changing the weighting for Honors to 0.5 effective with the 2009–2010 school year and for AP and IB courses to 1.0 retroactively.

After investigation, the Fairfax County School Board approved a modified ten-point scale with pluses and minuses. The new scale went into effect at the beginning of the 2009–10 school year. 93–100% is an A, 90–92% is an A−, 87–89% is a B+, and so on.

===Controversy over disciplinary policies===
In 2009, Fairfax County Public Schools&#x27; disciplinary policies for drug offenses came under community scrutiny after two students committed suicide after being subject to school disciplinary proceedings. Both 17-year-old Josh Anderson of South Lakes High School, who died in 2009, and 15-year-old Nick Stuban of Woodson High School, who died in 2011, had been suspended from their schools for marijuana-related offenses. The school district also suspended at least one student for possession of her prescription medication.

Although then-Superintendent Jack D. Dale maintained that the disciplinary policy did not constitute &quot;zero tolerance,&quot; the suicides nevertheless prompted the school board and the state legislature to revisit school disciplinary policies. After a year-long study, the school board voted to relax punishments for marijuana possession and add parental notification requirements for students facing serious disciplinary sanctions.

===Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology===

In late 2022 and early 2023, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology was investigated by the State Attorney General Jason Miyares for withholding notification from parents that their children were awarded the National Merit Award, which made national headlines. Along with Thomas Jefferson High School being sued for a change made to admissions policy.

== Organization ==
FCPS is led by a superintendent and is overseen by a school board. The current superintendent is Dr. Michelle C. Reid, who began her term on July 1, 2022.

For FCPS administrative and governance purposes, Fairfax County is organized into six geographically based regions (1 through 6). Each region is led by an assistant superintendent, who oversees operations at schools within the region.

FCPS&#x27;s headquarters is located in the Gatehouse Administration Center in Merrifield, an unincorporated section of the county near the city of Falls Church; the headquarters has a Falls Church address but is not within the city limits.

=== School Board ===

Virginia statutes and the Virginia Board of Education charge the Fairfax County School Board with setting general school policy and establishing guidelines that ensure proper administration and operation of FCPS.

The Fairfax County School Board comprises 12 elected members and one student representative. Nine elected members are chosen from each magisterial district (Braddock, Dranesville, Franconia, Hunter Mill, Mason, Mount Vernon, Providence, Springfield, and Sully). Three additional elected members are chosen &quot;at-large&quot;. Members are elected for four-year terms. A student representative, selected for a one-year term by the Student Advisory Council, sits with the board at all public meetings and participates in discussions but does not vote. The board chair is elected to serve for a one-year term, and the current chair Karl Frisch (Providence), has been serving since January 1, 2024.

The current members of the school board are Rachna Sizemore Heizer (Braddock), Robyn A. Lady (Dranesville), Marcia C. St. John-Cunning (Franconia), Melanie K. Meren (Hunter Mill), Ricardy J. Anderson (Mason), Mateo Dunne (Mount Vernon), Karl V. Frisch (Providence), Sandy B. Anderson (Springfield), Seema Dixit (Sully). The other three members, R. Kyle McDaniel, Ryan L. McElveen, and Ilryong Moon, serve as &quot;at-large&quot; members. Megan Sawant from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST) serves as the non-voting student representative.

Transportation is divided into several different offices. Area 1, Area 2, Area 3, and Area 4 are regional offices servicing different regions of the county. Area 1 serves the farthest south, Area 2 serves the central south, Area 3 serves the central north, and Area 4 serves the farthest northern region. A central office oversees all lower offices and a training center. The final office is Routing and Planning, which creates bus routes. Routing and Planning, also known as Area 7, maintains a fleet of vehicles. The white vans and cars from Area 7 transport special needs students to special public and private schools throughout the county.

Three garages service the buses: Alban, Newington, and West Ox.

<text>Hubbard Lake is a lake in Alcona County in Northern Michigan. The lake covers 8,850 acres (36 km²) and is seven miles (11 km) long (north-south) and two miles (3 km) wide. It has a maximum depth of 85 feet (26 m) with an average depth of 32.6 feet (9.9 m). The lake spans three townships: Caledonia, Alcona, and Hawes.

The lake is part of the a large tract of land (more than six million acres (24,000 km²)) that was ceded by the Ojibwa, Ottawa and Potawatomi to the United States in the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw. Permanent white settlers did not begin to arrive in the area until the 1830s and 1840s. At that time, the lake was known as the &quot;Bottomless Lake&quot;. It was also for a while known as &quot;Coral Lake&quot; and &quot;Alcona Lake&quot;. In 1867, it was named &quot;Hubbard Lake&quot; in honor of Dr. Bela Hubbard, who was a prominent geologist in the state of Michigan.

The lake is fed by five streams. It was dammed to make it deeper for use as a float pond during the lumber boom. A concrete dam on its north end supplies power to the Alpena Power Company. &quot;The dam, however, is capable of holding a 6.6 foot head as was maintained early this year. At the high level, wave action caused considerable damage to shore installations. According to the caretaker of the dam the lowest point possible is the 4.2 foot level.&quot;Inland Lakes of Michigan&quot; by I. D. Scott&quot; (1921) published by the Michigan Geological Society.

The lake is well stocked with bass, yellow perch, northern pike, trout and walleye and is a popular destination for summer angling as well as winter ice fishing. Although it is not an incorporated municipality, for statistical purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau defines the area immediately surrounding the lake as a census-designated place named Hubbard Lake. There is also a separate, small unincorporated community named Hubbard Lake located about one mile (1.6 km) north of the lake in Ossineke Township in neighboring Alpena County.

<doc id="1174103" wikidata="Q2572143" url="?curid=1174103" title="Henri Gouraud">
<text>Henri Gouraud (born November 17, 1867, in Paris and died September 16, 1946, in the same city) was a French army general. He played a central role in the colonization of French Africa and the Levant. During World War I, he fought in major battles such as those of the Argonne, the Dardanelles, and Champagne. An important figure in the aftermath of the Ottoman Empire, he served as High Commissioner of the French Republic in the Levant from 1919 to 1922, during which he led military campaigns in Cilicia and Syria.

Affiliated with the colonial party, Gouraud was an active colonizer, influenced by figures such as Joseph Gallieni and Hubert Lyautey. His name remains closely associated with the conquest of Sudan, Mauritania, Chad, and Morocco, and his arrest of Samory Touré in September 1898 marked a turning point in the French colonization of West Africa. This act brought him to prominence at a time when France sought to overcome the humiliation of the Fashoda Incident.

During World War I, Gouraud distinguished himself by his courage and sacrifice. Seriously wounded in the Dardanelles, where he lost his right arm, he became a symbol of resilience and a national hero. His victory over Ludendorff in the Argonne led to the liberation of Strasbourg, the reconquest of Alsace-Lorraine, and the victory of France.

After the war, as High Commissioner in the Levant, he played a key role in reorganizing the region, leading campaigns in Cilicia and Syria, and redrawing the borders of the Middle East. He is particularly famous for proclaiming the creation of Greater Lebanon in 1920, marking a significant step in French colonial policy.

Back in France, Gouraud continued his military career, becoming Military Governor of Paris from 1923 to 1937. At the end of his career, he embodied a figure of transition, having actively participated in the implementation of various colonial regimes (colony, protectorate, mandate). According to Julie d&#x27;Andurain, “as an actor and witness of these changes, Henri Gouraud understood that the time of colonies would be succeeded by the time of empires and international organizations”. He thus linked with the next generation, that of men like Georges Catroux and Jules Bührer.

His policy of dividing Syria into several small states based on confessional criteria marked a significant step in French colonial policy in the Levant, aiming to divide territories to control them better. Set against a backdrop of imperial rivalries and nationalist tensions, it is still criticized today for its consequences on the stability and unity of the region.
== Early life ==
Henri Gouraud was born on Rue de Grenelle in the 7th arrondissement of Paris to Doctor Xavier Gouraud and Marie Portal, the first of six children. The Gouraud family originally came from Vendée, but had left during the French Revolution for Angers, then Paris.
Gouraud was educated at home and at the Collège Stanislas de Paris. His decision for a military career was, like many Frenchmen of his generation, motivated by the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871).

Gouraud entered the Saint Cyr Military Academy in 1888 as part of the &quot;Grand Triomphe&quot; promotion, a well-chosen name as it included sixty future generals. He graduated in 1890 and joined the Troupes de marine. He expected to be posted overseas as the Troupes de marine served in the French colonial empire, but his father objected because he feared that the marines would be a bad influence on his son. Gouraud respected his father&#x27;s wish and was instead posted to the 21st Foot Chasseur Regiment at Montbéliard.

== Africa ==
Henri Gouraud was assigned in 1894 to French Sudan. He developed a reputation as an effective if lucky commander. In 1898, he was ordered to head one of a number of units fighting Samori, the resistance leader who had been fighting the French for more than a decade. Driven into the highlands south of Niger River valley by a series of previous defeats, Samori&#x27;s forces were defeated within the year. On 29 September 1898, Gouraud&#x27;s unit stumbled upon Samori&#x27;s encampment and captured him. More importantly, it marked the end of the last large state opposing French colonialism in the West.

The capture of Samori made Henri Gouraud a celebrated figure in France, at the same time as nationalist feeling in the country was heightened by the Fashoda Incident. The young captain was feted in the highest political circles of Paris, where he was introduced to powerful businessmen and politicians with interests in the colonial project. Among them were Auguste d&#x27;Arenberg and Eugène Étienne, future founders of what was called the &quot;parti colonial&quot;. Thanks to the patronage of the &quot;parti colonial&quot;, Henri Gouraud pursued a career across French Africa for the next fifteen years, with postings in Niger, Chad and Mauritania. In 1907, he was promoted to colonel and &quot;commissaire du Gouvernement général&quot; of Mauritania, where he led a campaign against Bedouin tribes who threatened transport between the colonies of Morocco and French West Africa.

In 1911, after attending the &quot;centre des Hautes études militaires&quot; in France, colonel Gouraud was stationed in Morocco, where he was promoted to général de brigade, serving under Lyautey. He was placed in command of the Fez military region, and from 1914 to 1915 in command of all French colonial troops in western Morocco.

== World War I ==
In mid-1915 he served as commander of the French Expeditionary Corps that was committed to the Dardanelles campaign. He was wounded on 30 June, and subsequently lost his right arm.

From December 1915 to December 1916 and from June 1917 until the end of the war he commanded the Fourth Army on the Western Front, where he gained distinction for his use of elastic defense during the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918.

On 22 November 1918 he entered the city of Strasbourg, overthrowing the Soviet government that had been proclaimed there on 11 November 1918.

== French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon ==

After the war, Gouraud served from 1919 to 1922 as representative of the French Government in the Middle East and commander of the French Army of the Levant. As commander of French forces during the Franco-Turkish War, he presided over the creation of the French Mandates in Syria and Lebanon. Following the implementation of the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement, which divided the occupied remnants of the Ottoman Empire between France and Britain, Gouraud was commander of forces sent to enforce the French division of the Levant.

Between 20 January and 10 February 1920, Gouraud&#x27;s troops were moved north to support forces in the Franco-Turkish War. Gouraud directed the suppression of a rising of Turkish National Forces at the Battle of Marash which led to the withdrawal of French troops back to Syria.
There, Gouraud&#x27;s ongoing attempt to control King Faisal came to a head. Gouraud led French forces which crushed King Faisal&#x27;s short-lived monarchy at the Battle of Maysalun on 23 July 1920, occupied Damascus, defeated the forces of the Syrian Revolution and established the French Mandate of Syria. These territories were reorganised a number of times by Gouraud&#x27;s decrees, the most famous being the creation of the State of Greater Lebanon on 1 September 1920. Gouraud became the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon, effective head of the colonial government there.

He is remembered in the Levant primarily for this role, and for an anecdote. Following the Battle of Maysalun, Gouraud allegedly went to the Tomb of Saladin, kicked it, and said: “&quot;Awake, Saladin. We have returned. My presence here consecrates the victory of the Cross over the Crescent&quot;.&quot; The quote is sometimes attributed to Mariano Goybet instead of Gouraud.

Gouraud&#x27;s administration in Syria borrowed much from his time as a young man working under Lyautey in Morocco, where colonial policy focused on control of the country through manipulation of tribes, Sufis, and the rural Berber populations. In Syria, this took the form of separate administrations for Druze and Alawite communities, with the aim of dividing their interests from those of urban nationalists.

Particularly unpopular following the French taking of Damascus, the Syrian nationalist Adham Khanjar of Southern Lebanon staged a failed attempt on Gouraud&#x27;s life on 23 June 1921.

== Later years ==
In 1923, he returned to France, where he was the Military Governor of Paris from 1923 to 1937. He also served on the Supreme Allied War Council from 1927 until his retirement in 1937. General Gouraud died in Paris in 1946.

*A massive cedar tree near the town of Ifrane in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco was named for the General; the &quot;Gouraud Cedar&quot; is considered to be over 800 years old, and was &quot;discovered&quot; by Gouraud&#x27;s troops during the French campaign against anti-colonial resistance on the Timahdite Plateau in the years 1917–19. Moreover, the Cèdre Gouraud Forest in the Middle Atlas Mountain Range is named for Gouraud; this forest is one of the few remaining habitats of the endangered Barbary macaque.
*Rue Gouraud in the Achrafieh district of Beirut is named for the General.

<text>&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; pneumonia is a form of bacterial pneumonia caused by the bacterium &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;.

== Signs and symptoms ==
&quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; is known to cause a host of symptoms such as primary atypical pneumonia, tracheobronchitis, and upper respiratory tract disease. Primary atypical pneumonia is one of the most severe types of manifestation, with tracheobronchitis being the most common symptom and another 15% of cases, usually adults, remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic infections tend to develop over a period of several days and manifestation of pneumonia can be confused with a number of other bacterial pathogens and conditions that cause pneumonia. Tracheobronchitis is most common in children due to a reduced immune system capacity, and up to 18% of infected children require hospitalization. Common mild symptoms include sore throat, wheezing and coughing, fever, headache, rhinitis, myalgia and feelings of unease, in which symptom intensity and duration can be limited by early treatment with antibiotics. Rarely, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; pneumonia results in death due to lesions and ulceration of the epithelial lining, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis obliterans. 

Non-pulmonary symptoms such as autoimmune responses, central nervous system complications, and dermatological disorders have been associated with &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections in up to 25% of cases. Hemolysis occurs regularly, but often remains asymptomatic (fatigue, Raynaud syndrome only in cold season), as well as carditis, joint disease, and gastrointestinal disease.

== Cause ==
&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; is spread through respiratory droplet and aerosol transmission.

==Pathophysiology==

Once attached to the mucosa of a host organism, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; extracts nutrients, grows, and reproduces by binary fission. Attachment sites include the upper and lower respiratory tract, causing pharyngitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. The infection caused by this bacterium is called atypical pneumonia because of its protracted course and lack of sputum production and wealth of non-pulmonary symptoms. Chronic &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatological diseases.

&quot;Mycoplasma&quot; atypical pneumonia can be complicated by Stevens–Johnson syndrome, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, cardiovascular diseases, encephalitis, or Guillain–Barré syndrome.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; infections is complicated by its associated delayed onset of symptoms and the similarity of symptoms to other pulmonary conditions. Often, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections are diagnosed as other conditions, and occasionally, non-pathogenic mycoplasmas present in the respiratory tract are mistaken for &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;. 

Historically, the diagnosis of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections was made based on the presence of cold agglutinins (though this method should be used cautiously due to its mediocre and poor sensitivity and specificity, respectively). Additionally, the ability of the infected material to reduce tetrazolium was also considered. While laboratory testing is crucial for causative diagnosis, these methods are more practical for epidemiological studies than for patient diagnosis. Culture tests are rarely used as diagnostic tools; rather immunoblotting, immunofluorescent staining, hemadsorption tests, tetrazolium reduction, metabolic inhibition tests, serological assays, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used for diagnosis and characterization of bacterial pneumonic infections. PCR is the most rapid and effective way to determine the presence of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, however the procedure does not indicate the activity or viability of the cells present. Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) serological assays are the most common method of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; detection used in patient diagnosis due to the low cost and relatively short testing time. One drawback of serology is that viable organisms are required, which may overstate the severity of infection. Neither of these methods, along with others, has been available to medical professionals in a rapid, efficient and inexpensive enough form to be used in routine diagnosis, leading to decreased ability of physicians to diagnose &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections.

==Treatment==
While antibiotics with activity specifically against &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; are often used (e.g., erythromycin or doxycycline), it is unclear if these result in greater benefit than using antibiotics without specific activity against this organism in those with an infection acquired in the community.

The majority of antibiotics used to treat &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections are targeted at bacterial rRNA in ribosomal complexes, including macrolides, tetracycline, ketolides, and fluoroquinolone, many of which can be administered orally. Macrolides are capable of reducing hyperresponsiveness and protecting the epithelial lining from oxidative and structural damage, however they are capable only of inhibiting bacteria (bacteriostatic) and are not able to cause bacterial cell death. The most common macrolides used in the treatment of infected children in Japan are erythromycin and clarithromycin, which inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding 23S rRNA. Administration of antibiotics has been proven to reduce the longevity and intensity of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections in comparison to cases left untreated. Additionally, some high-dose steroid therapies have shown to reverse neurological effects in children with complicated infections.

The difficulty in eradicating &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; infections is due to the ability of the bacterium to persist within an individual, as well as the lack of cell wall in &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, which renders multiple antibiotics directed at the bacterial cell wall ineffective in treating infections. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; therefore displays resistance to antimicrobials such as β-lactams, glycopeptides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, polymixins, nalidixic acid, and rifampin. Antimicrobial drug resistance rates for &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; were determined in clinical specimens and isolates obtained during 2011–2012 in Ontario, Canada. Of 91 &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; drug-resistant specimens, 11 (12.1%) carried nucleotide mutations associated with macrolide resistance in the 23S rRNA gene. None of the &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; specimens were resistant to fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines.

== Prognosis ==
== Prevention ==
Transmission of &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot; infections is difficult to limit because of the several day period of infection before symptoms appear. The lack of proper diagnostic tools and effective treatment for the bacterium also contribute to the outbreak of infection. Using network theory, Meyers &quot;et al.&quot; analyzed the transmission of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections and developed control strategies based on the created model. They determined that cohorting patients is less effective due to the long incubation period, and so the best method of prevention is to limit caregiver–patient interactions and reduce the movement of caregivers to multiple hospital wards.

As with all airborne disease, airborne precautions and routine indoor air management tools are likely to reduce transmission.

Vaccine design for &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; has been focused primarily on prevention of host cell attachment, which would prevent initiation of cytotoxicity and subsequent symptoms. To date, vaccines targeted at the P1 adhesin have shown no reduction in the onset of infection, and some vaccine trials resulted in worsened symptoms due to immune system sensitization. Recent experiments in mouse models have linked this phenomenon to immune system sensitization by the lipid moieties of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; lipoproteins. Introduction of peptides that block adhesion receptors on the surface of the host cell may also be able to prevent attachment of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of mycoplasma pneumonia (MP) is greater among children than adults. Many adults remain asymptomatic, while children typically do not.

The incidence of disease does not appear to be related to season or geography; however, infection tends to occur more frequently during the summer and fall months when other respiratory pathogens are less prevalent. Reinfection and epidemic cycling is thought to be a result of P1 adhesin subtype variation. Approximately 40% of community-acquired pneumonia is due to &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections, with children and elderly individuals being most susceptible, however no personal risk factors for acquiring &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; induced pneumonia have been determined. Transmission of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; can only occur through close contact and exchange of aerosols by coughing due to the increased susceptibility of the cell wall-lacking organism to desiccation. Outbreaks of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; infections tend to occur within groups of people in close and prolonged proximity, including schools, institutions, military bases, and households.

Rates of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; pneumonia in all global community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases range from 10-15%. The rate of &quot;Mycoplasma&quot; pneumonia in adults with CAP is estimated to be 15%, and the rate of in children with CAP has been reported at 27.4%. The rates of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; among hospitalized CAP cases are 35% in adults and 24% in children. Rates of hospitalizations among adults increase with age. &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; has been shown to act as a trigger for other lung diseases.

Cases of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; may be unreported due to patients with few or no symptoms not seeking medical care. On a global scale, differences in lab techniques and sampling methods can also impact the reported number of cases.

&quot;M. pneumoniae&quot; can be spread by droplets and aerosols, typically from an infected person coughing or sneezing. If a person still has a cough, they can remain infectious even after a majority of other symptoms disappear.

Outbreaks follow a 3–7 year cycle. It is thought that factors such as climate, season, and geography have little impact on rates of &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;. Cases in the United States are more prevalent in the late summer and early fall, while other regions report that seasons did not affect case rate. It is thought that weather events like El Niño can impact the yearly cycles and seasonal difference between continents.

<text>Col. Charles Clinton (1690 – 19 November 1773) was an Anglo-Irish soldier and politician in colonial America. A colonel of the French and Indian War, he was the father of General James Clinton and George Clinton, and the grandfather of DeWitt Clinton.

==Early life==
Charles Clinton was born in Corboy, County Longford, Kingdom of Ireland. He was the son of James Clinton and Elizabeth (née Smith) Clinton.

==Life in America==
In May 1729, Charles, his wife Elizabeth, with two daughters and one son, chartered a ship from Dublin called the &quot;George and Anne&quot; and sailed for Philadelphia with a group of neighbors and friends from County Longford intending to settle in Pennsylvania. According to his papers, he paid for ninety four of the passengers. The captain of the ship intentionally starved the passengers, possibly as a way to steal their belongings. Ninety-six of the passengers died, including Clinton&#x27;s son and a daughter. In October 1729, they arrived at Cape Cod, and after paying a large ransom for their lives, the survivors were allowed to disembark.

In the spring of 1731, the group moved to Ulster County, New York (now Orange County), where they settled in an area called Little Britain about eight miles from the Hudson River and sixty miles north of New York City. The farm was a little more than 312 acres. Charles Clinton&#x27;s life there is described in this selection from DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s memoir:

His first appointment was that of a Justice of the peace; he was afterwards promoted to the station of a Judge of the Common Pleas for the county of Ulster. In 1756 he was appointed by colonial governor Sir Charles Hardy, a Lt. Colonel of the militia of the province, and commanded a regiment at the capture of Fort Frontenac, now Kingston, by Colonel Bradstreet. His sons James and George served with him at Frontenac.

==Personal life==
Charles Clinton married Elizabeth Denniston. Together, they had seven children:

* Catherine Clinton (1723–1762) married Col. James McClaughry (1722–1790)
* James Clinton (1726–1729) died at sea
* Mary Clinton (1728–1729) died at sea
* Alexander Clinton (1732–1758) became a physician and died of smallpox in 1758
* Charles Clinton (1734–1791) became a surgeon
* Major-General James Clinton (1736–1812)
* Governor George Clinton (1739–1812), who served as the 4th vice president of the United States.

Clinton died on his farm on 19 November 1773 at the age of 83, just before the revolution in which his sons would play a part. His widow, Elizabeth, died at the residence of their son James in 1779.
