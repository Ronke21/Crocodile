Some years later, Electra seeks revenge with the help of her brother Orestes and their cousin Pylades. Orestes and Pylades attend a festival to Bacchus hosted by Aegisthus. When Aegisthus challenges Orestes to a mock knife fight, Orestes uses the opportunity to kill him. Electra invites Clytemnestra to her house under false pretenses. Despite Clytemnestra explaining her reasons for killing her husband and apologising for her actions towards Electra, Electra enables Orestes to stab Clytemnestra to death.

<doc id="452898" wikidata="Q146290" url="?curid=452898" title="Howea forsteriana">
<text>Howea forsteriana, the Kentia palm, thatch palm or palm court palm, is a species of flowering plant in the palm family, Arecaceae, endemic to Lord Howe Island in Australia. It is also widely grown on Norfolk Island. It is a relatively slow-growing palm, eventually growing up to tall by wide. Its fronds can reach long. The palm gets its common name from the capital of Lord Howe Island, Kentia, and the genus name, Howea, from the island itself. The species name &quot;forsteriana&quot; is after Johann Reinhold Forster and Georg Forster, father and son, who accompanied Captain Cook as naturalists on his second voyage to the Pacific in 1772–1775.

The species is considered vulnerable by the World Conservation Union. It is cultivated on Lord Howe Island by collecting wild seeds and germinating them for export worldwide as an ornamental garden or house plant. The trade in the seeds and seedlings is tightly regulated. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==History==

&quot;Howea forsteriana&quot; gained great popularity as a houseplant in Europe and the United States during the Victorian era, at a time when exotic palms and other plants were avidly collected in England and elsewhere. The Kentia became the quintessential &#x27;parlor palm&#x27; beginning in the 1870s, when seed exports from Lord Howe Island first started. In part this was because the plant thrived in interiors where low light, low humidity, poor air quality and cool temperatures made palms otherwise impossible to grow. One of the earliest growers were the De Clerc family in Belgium, who remained one of the dominant growers of the palm in Europe for the next century.

By 1885 the palm had achieved preeminence in Britain, where the Journal of Horticulture commented that: &quot;These Kentias are in greater demand than almost any other palm on account of their great beauty and enduring properties.&quot; Another reason for their popularity is attributable to Queen Victoria, who cultivated them in all of her homes and left instructions for Kentia palms to be placed around her coffin while she lay in state. The association with royalty and the fact that Kentias were quite expensive to buy gave those who could furnish their homes with them a certain prestige.

The Palm Courts which became popular in Edwardian hotels like those of The Ritz Hotel in London or the Plaza Hotel in New York all featured Kentia palms, aesthetically pleasing because of their architectural, drooping fronds and the great height they reach at maturity. They continue to be used in such contexts, being a plant of choice for modern hotel lobbies, casinos, and shopping malls. One of the first class facilities of RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, such as the Verandah Café (a palm court), had featured a number of potted Kentia palms.

During the Edwardian era, around 4 million seeds were harvested annually on Lord Howe Island to satisfy the market for Kentias. In 1912, a Judicial Royal Commission was formed in Australia to investigate the cultivation and marketing of the palm on the island. At the beginning of the 21st century, production of Kentia palm seeds globally stood at between 30 and 40 million.

==Cultivation==

The palm is an elegant plant, and is popular for growing indoors, requiring little light. Out of doors, it prefers a tropical region but will also grow in a cooler climate, and can tolerate temperatures down to -5 °C, but only for a few hours; normal temperatures should not go below 10°. It grows readily outside in areas such as southern Australia and northern New Zealand, where it is fairly common in private gardens or as a street tree.

In the Northern Hemisphere, it can be grown as far north as southwest England, and grows well in the south of Spain and the southern United States, and will bear flowers and fruit. The coasts of the southeastern Azores and Madeira offer climates similar to its original habitat. It is slow growing, but will eventually reach heights of 6 to 18 metres. Under natural conditions, it grows as a solitary tree. Germination of the seeds is erratic.

The closely related Belmore sentry palm (&quot;Howea belmoreana&quot;), also endemic on Lord Howe Island, is a smaller species to 7 metres tall, found mainly as an understorey plant in moist forests.

A potted Kentia palm sold in modern-day garden centers generally does not consist of one palm but 2 to 5, planted in clusters as seedlings to give the plant a shrubbier look. They remain relatively expensive to purchase, because the export of seeds from Lord Howe Island is strictly controlled, the germination rate for seeds is low, and the plant is a slow grower, requiring years of nurturing to reach saleable size. In Europe Kentias are primarily nursery-grown in Holland and then sold throughout the continent. They are more popular, less expensive, and easier to purchase in European countries than they are in the United States, where much of the commercial growing is done in Hawaii before plants are brought to the mainland.

===Care===
As potted plants Kentias are fairly tolerant of neglect: they can withstand low-light conditions, low humidity, infrequent watering and cool temperatures. However, it is advisable to give Kentias bright, indirect light to encourage growth and a more robust appearance; Kentias placed in dark corners with little natural light tend to look leggy and grow very slowly. In the northern hemisphere, a northern or northeastern window is best, as greenhouse-grown Kentias cannot tolerate direct sun and will sunburn if placed in such an exposure.

The roots are very sensitive to disturbance, so gardeners should only repot Kentias after they have become extremely root bound in their existing pot, and even then should take special care. They appreciate regular water but should be allowed to dry out between waterings. Overwatering, or allowing the roots to sit in water, can induce root rot and kill the palm. An indoor houseplant fertilizer should be applied regularly in the spring and summer to encourage growth.

If used indoors, the fronds should be misted three times a week with rainwater to raise the humidity levels and keep the fronds looking green and healthy.

<text>Lana Wood (born Svetlana Lisa Gurdin; March 1, 1946) is an American actress and producer. She made her film debut in &quot;The Searchers&quot; as a child actress and later achieved notability for playing Sandy Webber on the TV series &quot;Peyton Place&quot; and Plenty O&#x27;Toole in the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. Her older sister was Natalie Wood.

==Early life==
Wood was born Svetlana Lisa Gurdin to Russian immigrant parents, Maria Zudilova (1908–1998) and Nicholas Zacharenko (1912–1980). They had each left Russia as child refugees with their parents following the Russian Civil War, and they grew up far from their homeland. Her father&#x27;s family left Vladivostok after her grandfather, a chocolate-factory worker who joined the anti-Bolshevik civilian forces, was killed in a street fight in 1922; they settled in Vancouver, British Columbia, with their relatives, then moved to San Francisco. Lana&#x27;s maternal grandfather owned soap and candle factories in Barnaul; he left Russia with his family in 1918 after his eldest son was killed by the Red Army, and settled in a Russian community in Harbin, China. Maria married Alexander Tatuloff there in 1925, and they had a daughter, Olga Viripaeff (1928–2015), before divorcing in 1936.

When Nicholas and Maria married in February 1938, she brought her daughter Olga, then known as Ovsanna, to the household, sharing joint custody with her ex-husband in El Cerrito, California. The couple had two daughters together; the first was Natalie, known as &quot;Natasha&quot;, the Russian diminutive. The family settled in Santa Monica, near Hollywood, and changed their surname to Gurdin. Svetlana, known as &quot;Lana&quot;, was born there. RKO executives David Lewis and William Goetz changed the surname of her elder sister, making her Natalie Wood, after she started her acting career as a child. She was named after director Irving Pichel&#x27;s friend Sam Wood. When Lana made her film debut in &quot;The Searchers&quot; (1956), her mother was asked under what last name Lana should be credited. Maria agreed to use &quot;Wood&quot; for Lana, building on Natalie&#x27;s recognized work.

Through her paternal cousin Kaisaliisa Zacharenko, Wood is distantly related by marriage to baseball player Tim Lincecum.

==Career==

In her early career, Wood usually played in films in which Natalie appeared. Starting in the 1960s, her own career took off. After appearing on the short-lived drama series &quot;The Long, Hot Summer&quot;, she landed the role of Sandy Webber on the soap series &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. She played the role from 1966 to 1967. She turned down the Karen Black role in &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot; (1970), a decision she now cites as the worst mistake she has made in her career. She was cast as a Bond girl, Plenty O&#x27;Toole, in the James Bond film &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). In 1970, Wood was approached by Hugh Hefner and she agreed to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot;. The &quot;Playboy&quot; pictures appeared in the April 1971 issue, along with Wood&#x27;s poetry.

Wood has more than 20 other films and over 300 television series to her credit, including &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, and &quot;Capitol&quot;. After appearing in the horror film &quot;Satan&#x27;s Mistress&quot; (1982), she retired from acting, concentrating on her career as a producer, but since 2008 she has returned to acting in a number of low-budget films. Wood is a character in the Steve Alten book &quot;&quot; (2009).

She wrote a memoir, &quot;Natalie, A Memoir by Her Sister&quot; (1984), and another, &quot;Little Sister&quot; (2021), in which she claimed veteran actor Kirk Douglas sexually assaulted her sister Natalie when she was just 16.

==Personal life==

Wood has been married six times:
# Jack Wrather Jr. – (1962–1963; annulled when she was 16 years old)
# Karl Brent – (1964–1965; divorced)
# Stephen Oliver – (1966–1966; annulled)
# Dr. Stanley William Vogel (1968–1968; divorced)
# Richard Smedley – (1972–1976; divorced) one child, Evan Taylor Smedley Maldonado (August 11, 1974 – July 18, 2017), by whom she has three grandchildren.
# Allan G. Balter (1979–1980; divorced)

Between marriages, Wood dated actors Dean Stockwell, Adam West, Eddie Fisher, Warren Beatty, Sean Connery, Alain Delon and Ryan O&#x27;Neal, as well as talent agent Guy McElwaine, producer Jerome Hellman and composer Leslie Bricusse. For most of the 1980s she was in a relationship with Alan Feinstein. Feinstein was at Natalie&#x27;s funeral with her.

Wood&#x27;s sister Natalie was married to actor Robert Wagner until her drowning death on November 29, 1981. She has long been at odds with both Wagner and his third wife Jill St. John, her feud with the latter dating back to when both appeared in &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

<text>A sniper rifle is a high-precision, long-range rifle. Requirements include high accuracy, reliability, and mobility, concealment, and optics, for anti-personnel, anti-materiel and surveillance uses by military snipers. The modern sniper rifle is a portable shoulder-fired rifle with either a bolt action or semi-automatic action, fitted with a telescopic sight for extreme accuracy and chambered for a high-ballistic performance centerfire cartridge.

==History==
The Whitworth rifle was arguably the first long-range sniper rifle in the world. Designed in 1854 by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer, it used barrels with hexagonal polygonal rifling, which meant that the projectile did not have to &quot;bite&quot; into the rifling grooves as with conventional rifling. His rifle was far more accurate than the Pattern 1853 Enfield, which had shown weaknesses during the Crimean War. At trials in 1857, which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth&#x27;s design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one. The Whitworth rifle was able to hit the target at a range of 2,000 yards (around 1,830 meters), whereas the Enfield could only manage it at a distance of 1,400 yards (around 1,280 meters). During the American Civil War, Confederate sharpshooters equipped with Whitworth rifles were tasked to kill Union field artillery crews, and were responsible for killing Major General John Sedgwick—one of the highest-ranking officers killed during the Civil War—at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House.

During the Crimean War, the first optical sights were designed for fitting onto the rifles. Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of a Colonel D. Davidson, using optical sights produced by Chance Brothers of Birmingham. This allowed a marksman to more accurately observe and target objects at a greater distance than ever before. The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range. By the 1870s, the perfection of breech loading magazine rifles led to sniper rifles having &quot;effective accurate&quot; ranges of up to a mile away from their target.

===20th century===
During the Second Boer War, the latest breech-loading rifles with magazines and smokeless powder were used by both sides. The British were equipped with the Lee–Metford rifle, while the Boers had received the latest Mauser Model 1895 rifles from Germany. In the open terrain of South Africa, the marksman was a crucial component in battle. The Lovat Scouts was a British Army unit formed in 1899 that was renowned for the expert marksmanship and stalking skills of its personnel. The men wore ghillie suits for camouflage and were expertly skilled in observation. Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard said of them that &quot;keener men never lived&quot;. After the Boer War, the Scouts became the first official sniper unit in the British Army.

It was not until World War I that sniper rifles began to be used more regularly in battle and certain soldiers given specialized training to use such a rifle. In Germany, these trained snipers were given rifles with telescopic sights, which illuminated at night in order to improve their accuracy. German gunsmiths fitted the scope above the barrel for optimal accuracy.


During World War I, the accuracy of the sniper rifle was greatly improved. By the end of World War II, snipers were reported to provide &quot;reasonable accuracy&quot; over with anything over this range being unpredictable. It was during World War I and II that the word ‘sniper’ began to be used commonly, whereas previously those who were armed with sniper rifles were referred to as sharpshooters or marksmen.
These marksmen, wielding sniper rifles such as the Karabiner 98k and Mosin–Nagant Model 1891/30 sniper rifle, had a drastic and demoralizing effect on the battlefield. Soldiers would often remain hidden in foxholes or trenches so as not to expose themselves to the deadly accuracy of a sniper. Some soldiers even began to disregard orders from commanding officers to protect against potential harm, which thus broke down the chain of command on the battlefield. The sniper rifle soon acquired the reputation of being one of the most effective and ruthless weapons of war.

Though sniper rifles had proved to be extremely effective in combat, there was still a great reluctance in many militaries to adopt a trained sniper regiment. To effectively use a sniper rifle, a soldier had to go through particularly rigorous training, and most trainees did not make it past the first week. Sniper training was also so expensive to conduct that, even until as recently as 1970, the reasoning for having trained snipers as a part of an army was deemed questionable. In Britain, sniper rifles were not seen as being an integral part of an army until after the Germans boasted of their success with sniper teams during the early months of World War I. British army advisors supposed that the telescopic sights attached to sniper rifles were too easily damaged and thus not well suited for military use. However, they soon realized that these telescopic sights could be improved and made sturdy enough to withstand a sniper rifle shot.
Sniper rifles have continued to be used consistently throughout the later part of the 20th century in Korea, Vietnam and the Middle East as an integral part of the modern style of guerrilla warfare.

===21st century===
The durability, accuracy and power of sniper rifles circa 2010 are beyond anything in use even ten years prior, and dwarf those of World War II sniper rifles. Modern sniper rifles are very reliable and are able to fire repeatedly without losing accuracy, whereas earlier sniper rifles were more liable to lose accuracy due to wear and tear. Sniper rifles continue to be adapted and improved upon, with the effective range of sniper rifles (c. 2001) exceeding , making them one of the most accurate and efficient weapons in use.

==Classification==
Modern sniper rifles can be divided into two basic classes: military and law enforcement.

===Military===
Sniper rifles manufactured for military service are often designed for very high durability, range, reliability, sturdiness, serviceability, and repairability under adverse environmental and combat conditions, at the sacrifice of a small degree of accuracy. Military snipers and sharpshooters may also be required to carry their rifles and other equipment for long distances, making it important to minimize weight. Military organizations often operate under strict budget constraints, which influences the type and quality of sniper rifles they purchase.

=== Law enforcement ===
Sniper rifles built or modified for use in law enforcement are generally required to have the greatest possible accuracy, but do not need to have as long a range.

Law enforcement-specific rifles are usually used in non-combat (often urban) environments, so they do not have the requirement to be as hardy or portable as military versions; they may also be smaller due to the decrease in required range.

Some of the first sniper rifles designed specifically to meet police and other law-enforcement requirements were developed for West German police after the Munich massacre at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Many police services and law enforcement organizations (such as the U.S. Secret Service) now use rifles designed for law enforcement purposes.

The Heckler &amp; Koch PSG1 is one rifle specifically designed to meet these criteria and is often referred to as an ideal example of this type of sniper rifle. The FN Special Police Rifle was built for, and is marketed to, law enforcement rather than military agencies.

== Distinguishing characteristics ==
The features of a sniper rifle can vary widely depending on the specific tasks it is intended to perform. Features that may distinguish a sniper rifle from other weapons are the presence of a telescopic sight, unusually long overall length, a stock designed for firing from a prone position, and the presence of a bipod and other accessories.

=== Telescopic sight ===
Perhaps the single most important characteristic that sets a sniper rifle apart from other military or police small arms is the mounting of a telescopic sight, which is relatively easy to distinguish from smaller optical aiming devices found on some modern assault rifles and submachine guns (such as reflector sights). The telescopic sights used on sniper rifles differ from other optical sights in that they offer much greater magnification (more than 4× and up to 40×) and have a much larger objective lens (40 to 50 mm in diameter) for a brighter image.

Most telescopic lenses employed in military or police roles also have special reticles to aid with judgment of distance, which is an important factor in accurate shot placement due to the bullet&#x27;s trajectory.

=== Action ===
The choice between bolt-action and semi-automatic, usually recoil operation or gas operation for the latter, is usually determined by specific requirements of the sniper&#x27;s role in a particular organization, with each design having advantages and disadvantages. For a given cartridge, a bolt-action rifle is cheaper to build and maintain, more reliable, and lighter, due to fewer moving parts in the mechanism. In addition, the absence of uncontrolled automatic cartridge case ejection helps avoid revealing the shooter&#x27;s position. Semi-automatic weapons can serve both as a battle rifle and sniper rifle, and allow for a greater rate (and hence volume) of fire. As such rifles may be modified service rifles, an additional benefit can be commonality of operation with the issued infantry rifle. A bolt action is most commonly used in both military and police roles due to its higher accuracy and ease of maintenance. Special forces operators tend to prefer semi-automatic rifles over bolt-action rifles for certain applications such as detonating unexploded ordnance from a safe distance and penetrating reinforced structures that enemy combatants are using as cover.
A designated marksman rifle (DMR) is less specialized than a typical military sniper rifle, often only intended to extend the range of a group of soldiers. Therefore, when a semi-automatic action is used, it is due to an overlap with the roles of standard-issue weapons. There may also be additional logistical advantages if the DMR uses the same ammunition as the more common standard-issue weapons. These rifles enable a higher volume of fire, but sacrifice some long-range accuracy. They are frequently built from existing selective fire battle rifles or assault rifles, often simply by adding a telescopic sight and adjustable stock.

A police semi-automatic sniper rifle may be used in situations that require a single sniper to engage multiple targets in quick succession; military semi-automatics, such as the M110 SASS, are used in similar &quot;target-rich&quot; environments.

=== Magazine ===

In a military setting, logistical concerns are the primary determinant of the cartridge used, so sniper rifles are usually limited to rifle cartridges commonly used by the military force employing the rifle and match grade ammunition. Since large national militaries generally change slowly, military rifle ammunition is frequently battle-tested and well-studied by ammunition and firearms experts. Consequently, police forces tend to follow military practices in choosing a sniper rifle cartridge instead of trying to break new ground with less-perfected (but possibly better) ammunition.

Before the introduction of the standard 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) cartridge in the 1950s, standard military cartridges were the .30-06 Springfield (7.62×63mm) (United States), .303 British (7.7×56mmR) (United Kingdom), and 7.92×57 mm Mauser (Germany). The .30-06 Springfield continued in service with U.S. Marine Corps snipers during the Vietnam War in the 1970s, well after general adoption of the 7.62×51mm. At the present time, in both the Western world and within NATO, the 7.62×51mm is currently the primary cartridge of choice for military and police sniper rifles.

Worldwide, the trend is similar. The preferred sniper cartridge in Russia is another .30 caliber military cartridge, the 7.62×54mmR, which has slightly superior performance to the 7.62×51mm, although the rimmed design limits reliability compared to the latter cartridge. This cartridge was introduced in 1891, and both Russian sniper rifles of the modern era, the Mosin–Nagant and the SVD, are chambered for it.

Certain commercial cartridges designed with only performance in mind, without the logistical constraints of most armies, have also gained popularity in the 1990s. These include the 7mm Remington Magnum (7.2×64mm), .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62×67mm), and the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70mm). These cartridges offer better ballistic performance and greater effective range than the 7.62×51mm. Though they are not as powerful as .50 caliber cartridges, rifles chambered for these cartridges are not as heavy as those chambered for .50 caliber ammunition, and are significantly more powerful than rifles chambered for 7.62×51mm.

Snipers may also employ anti-materiel rifles in sniping roles against targets such as vehicles, equipment and structures, or for the long-range destruction of explosive devices; these rifles may also be used against personnel.

Anti-materiel rifles tend to be semi-automatic and of a larger caliber than other rifles, using cartridges such as the .50 BMG (12.7×99mm), 12.7×108mm, 14.5×114mm, and 20mm. These large cartridges are required to be able to fire projectiles containing payloads such as explosives, armor-piercing cores, incendiaries or combinations of these, such as the Raufoss Mk 211 projectile. Due to the considerable size and weight of anti-materiel rifles, two- or three-man sniper teams become necessary.

=== Barrel ===
Barrels are normally of precise manufacture and of a heavier cross section than more traditional barrels, in order to reduce the change in impact points between a first shot from a cold barrel and a follow-up shot from a warm barrel. Unlike many battle and assault rifles, the bores are usually not chromed to avoid inaccuracy due to an uneven treatment.

When installed, barrels are often free-floating—installed so that the barrel contacts the rest of the rifle only at the receiver. A free-floating barrel avoids contact with the fore-end of the stock by the barrel itself, sling, bipod, or the sniper&#x27;s hands that can interfere with barrel harmonics. The end of the barrel is usually crowned or machined to form a rebated area around the muzzle proper to avoid asymmetry or damage, and consequent inaccuracy.

External longitudinal fluting that contributes to heat dissipation by increasing the surface area, while simultaneously decreasing the weight of the barrel, is sometimes used on sniper rifle barrels.

Sniper-rifle barrels may also utilize a threaded muzzle or combination device (muzzle brake or flash suppressor and attachment mount) to allow the fitting of a suppressor. These suppressors often have a means of adjusting the point of impact while fitted.

Military sniper rifles tend to have barrel lengths of or longer to allow the cartridge propellant to fully burn, reducing the amount of revealing muzzle flash and increasing muzzle velocity. Police sniper rifles may use shorter barrels to improve handling characteristics. The shorter barrels&#x27; muzzle velocity loss is unimportant at closer ranges; the impact velocity of the bullet is more than sufficient.

=== Stock ===
The most common special feature of a sniper rifle stock is the adjustable cheek piece, where the shooter&#x27;s cheek meets the rear of the stock. For most rifles equipped with a telescopic sight, this area is raised slightly because the telescope is positioned higher than iron sights, and can sometimes be adjusted up or down to suit the individual shooter. To further aid this individual fitting, the stock can sometimes also be adjusted for length, often by varying the number of inserts at the rear of the stock where it meets the shooter&#x27;s shoulder. If the stock is manufactured from wood, environmental conditions or operational use may warp the wood, causing slight alignment or barrel harmonics changes over time and altering the point of impact. Stocks manufactured from polymers and metal alloys are less susceptible to point of impact shifting from environmental conditions. Sniper stocks are typically designed to avoid making contact with the barrel of the weapon to minimize the effects of environmental inconstancies. Modern sniper rifle stocks tend to be designed around a rigid chassis, offer user adjustability to allow shooters of various sizes and shapes to tailor the stock to their personal preferences, and modular attachment points to accommodate low-light and daylight aiming optics, laser designators, and other accessories without the need for custom-made mounting interface kits.

=== Accessories ===
An adjustable sling is often fitted on the rifle, used by the sniper to achieve better stability when standing, kneeling, or sitting. The sniper uses the sling to &quot;lock in&quot; by wrapping their non-firing arm into the sling, keeping that arm still.

Non-static weapon mounts, such as bipods, monopods, and shooting sticks, are also regularly used to aid and improve stability and reduce operator fatigue.

Shooting bags are also commonly used to help stabilize the rifle or to provide an adjustable base.

== Capabilities ==

=== Accuracy ===


A military-issue battle rifle or assault rifle is usually capable of between 3–6 minute of angle (0.9–1.7 milliradian) accuracy. A standard-issue military sniper rifle is typically capable of 1–3 MOA (0.3–0.9 mrad) accuracy, with a police sniper rifle capable of 0.25–1.5 MOA (0.1–0.4 mrad) accuracy. For comparison, a competition target or benchrest rifle may be capable of accuracy up to 0.15–0.3 MOA (0.04–0.09 mrad).

A 1 MOA (0.28 mrad) average extreme spread (the center-to-center distance between the two most distant bullet holes) for a 5-shot group translates into a 69% probability that the bullet&#x27;s point of impact will be in a target circle with a diameter of at . This average extreme spread for a 5-shot group and the accompanying hit probability are considered sufficient for effectively hitting a human at an 800-meter distance.

In 1982, a U.S. Army draft requirement for a Sniper Weapon System was: &quot;The System will: (6) Have an accuracy of no more than 0.75 MOA (0.2 mrad) for a 5-shot group at 1,500 meters when fired from a supported, non-benchrest position&quot;. The M24 Sniper Weapon System adopted in 1988 has a stated maximum effective range of 800 meters and a maximum allowed average mean radius (AMR) of 1.9 inches at 300 yards from a machine rest, which corresponds to a 0.6 MOA (0.17 mrad) extreme spread for a 5-shot group when using 7.62×51mm M118 Special Ball cartridges.

A 2008 United States military market survey for a Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) called for 1 MOA (0.3 mrad) extreme vertical spread for all shots in a 5-round group fired at targets at 300, 600, 900, 1,200 and 1,500 meters. In 2009, a United States Special Operations Command market survey called for a 1 MOA (0.28 mrad) extreme vertical spread for all shots in a 10-round group fired at targets at 300, 600, 900, 1,200, and 1,500 meters. The 2009 Precision Sniper Rifle requirements state that the PSR, when fired without a suppressor, shall provide a confidence factor of 80% that the weapon and ammunition combination is capable of holding 1 MOA (0.28 mrad) extreme vertical spread, calculated from 150 ten-round groups that were fired unsuppressed. No individual group was to exceed 1.5 MOA (0.42 mrad) extreme vertical spread. All accuracy was taken at the 1,500 meter point.

In 2008, the US military adopted the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System, which has a maximum allowed extreme spread of 1.8 MOA (0.5 mrad) for a 5-shot group on 300 feet, using M118LR ammunition or equivalent. In 2010, the maximum bullet dispersion requirement for the M24 .300 Winchester Magnum corresponded to 1.4 MOA (0.39 mrad) extreme spread for 5 shot group on 100 meters. In 2011, the US military adapted the .300 Winchester Magnum M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle, which had to meet an accuracy requirement to fire ≤ 1 MOA/0.28 mrad (less than a 2-inch shot group at 200 yards) before being released for fielding.

Although accuracy standards for police rifles do not widely exist, rifles are frequently seen with accuracy levels from 0.5 to 1.5 MOA (0.2–0.5 mrad). For typical policing situations, an extreme spread accuracy level no better than 1 MOA (0.3 mrad) is usually all that is required, as police typically employ their rifles at shorter ranges. At or less, a rifle with a relatively low accuracy of only 1 MOA (0.3 mrad) should be able to repeatedly hit a 3 cm (1.2 inch) target. A 3 cm diameter target is smaller than the brain stem, which is targeted by police snipers for its quick killing effect.

=== Maximum effective range ===
Unlike police sniper rifles, military sniper rifles tend to be employed at the greatest possible distances, so that range advantages, like an increased difficulty to spot and engage the sniper, can be exploited.

The most popular military sniper rifles (in terms of numbers in service) are chambered for 7.62 mm (0.30 inch) caliber ammunition, such as 7.62×51mm and 7.62×54mm R. Since sniper rifles of this class must compete with several other types of military weapons with similar range, snipers invariably must employ skilled fieldcraft to conceal their position.

The recent trend in specialized military sniper rifles is towards larger calibers that offer relatively favorable hit probabilities at greater range with anti-personnel cartridges, such as .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum, and anti-materiel cartridges, such as 12.7×99mm, 12.7×108mm, and 14.5×114mm. This allows snipers to take fewer risks and spend less time finding concealment when facing enemies that are not equipped with similar weapons.

Maximum range claims made by military organizations and materiel manufacturers regarding sniper weapon systems are not based on consistent or strictly scientific criteria. The problem is that the bullet only interacts after a relatively long flight path with the target (which can also be a materiel target for a sniper bullet). This implies that variables such as the minimal required hit probability, local atmospheric conditions, properties and velocity of the employed bullet (parts), properties of the target, and the desired terminal effect are major relevant factors that determine the maximum effective range of the employed system.

<text>Trinidad is the larger and more populous of the two major islands of Trinidad and Tobago. The island lies off the northeastern coast of Venezuela and sits on the continental shelf of South America. It is the southernmost island in the West Indies. With an area of , it is also the fifth largest in the West Indies.

==Name==
The original name for the island in the Arawaks&#x27; language was which meant &quot;Land of the Hummingbird&quot;. Christopher Columbus renamed it (&#x27;The Island of the Trinity&#x27;), fulfilling a vow he had made before setting out on his third voyage. This has since been shortened to &quot;Trinidad&quot;. Indo-Trinidadians called the island चीनीदत्त , 𑂒𑂲𑂢𑂲𑂠𑂞𑂹𑂞 , , &quot;Chinidat&quot; or &quot;Chinidad&quot; in Trinidadian Hindustani which translated to the land of sugar. The usage of the term goes back to the 19th century when recruiters from India would call the island &quot;Chinidat&quot; as a way of luring workers into indentureship. On Tuesday, 31 July, 1498 Columbus sent a sailor to climb up to the main top and sighted a cluster of three peaks, therefore Columbus named the island Trinidad from the three peaks and Columbus&#x27;s special devotion to the Trinity.

==History==

Caribs and Arawaks lived in Trinidad long before Christopher Columbus encountered the islands on his third voyage on 31 July 1498. The island remained Spanish until 1797, but it was settled mostly by French colonists from the French Caribbean, especially Martinique. In 1889 the two islands became a single British crown colony. Trinidad and Tobago was granted self-governance in 1958 and independence from the United Kingdom in August 1962, and it became a republic in September 1976.

==Geography==
Major landforms include the hills of the Northern, Central and Southern Ranges (Dinah ranges), the Caroni, Nariva and Oropouche Swamps, and the Caroni and Naparima Plains. Major river systems include the Caroni, North and South Oropouche and Ortoire Rivers. There are many other natural landforms such as beaches and waterfalls. 
Trinidad has two seasons per the calendar year: the rainy season and the dry season. El Cerro del Aripo, at 940 metres (3,084 ft), is the highest point in Trinidad. It is part of the Aripo Massif and is located in the Northern Range on the island, northeast of the town of Arima.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 Trinidad and Tobago Census, the population was 35.43% Indian, 34.22% African, 7.66% mixed African and East Indian, and 15.16% mixed race. Venezuela has also had a great impact on Trinidad&#x27;s culture, such as introducing the music style parang to the island. Many groups overlap. For example, a &quot;Dougla&quot; is a person of African and Indian descent.

==Culture==

There are multiple festivals on Trinidad, featuring the music of the Caribbean and the steelpan (which originated on Trinidad and is the country&#x27;s national instrument); These festivals include the multi-national, pre-Lenten Carnivál, J&#x27;ouvert, and Panorama, the national steelpan competition. 

In addition to the traditional Christian holidays and official public days (such as Boxing Day, Christmas, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, Emancipation Day, Good Friday, Independence Day, Labour Day, New Year&#x27;s Day, and Republic Day) in Trinidad, the island nation also celebrates a significant percentage of its population&#x27;s Indian ancestry (of both Hindu and Muslim backgrounds), with officially-recognised holidays such as Divali, Eid al-Fitr and Indian Arrival Day. Sites of cultural or religious significance include Mount Saint Benedict, the Temple in the Sea, and the Karyasiddhi Hanuman murti in Carapichaima.

==Zoology==
The island of Trinidad has a rich biodiversity. The fauna is overwhelmingly of South American origin. There are about 100 species of mammals including the Guyanese red howler monkey, the collared peccary, the red brocket deer, the ocelot and about 70 species of bats. There are over 400 species of birds including the endemic Trinidad piping-guan. Reptiles are well represented, with about 92 recorded species including the largest species of snake in the world, the green anaconda, the spectacled caiman, and one of the largest lizards in the Americas, the green iguana. Trinidad is also the largest leatherback turtle nesting site in the western hemisphere; they nest on Trinidad&#x27;s eastern and northern beaches. There are 37 recorded frog species, including the tiny El Tucuche golden tree frog, Trinidad poison frog, and the more widespread huge cane toad. About 43 species of freshwater fish are known from Trinidad, including the well known guppy. It is estimated that there are at least 80,000 arthropods, and at least 600 species of butterflies.

The William Beebe Tropical Research Station (founded by William Beebe), also known as Simla, lies north of Arima.

==Economy==
The economy of Trinidad and Tobago is diversified, based to a large extent on oil and natural gas. It is one of the leading gas-based export centers in the world, being one of the top five exporters of liquefied natural gas and the largest onshore natural gas well was recently discovered in southern Trinidad. This has allowed Trinidad to capitalize on the biggest mineral reserves within its territories. It is an oil-rich country and stable economically.

==Geology==

The Venezuela Tertiary Basin is a subsidence basin formed between the Caribbean and South American plates, and is bounded on the north by the coast ranges of Venezuela and the Northern Range of Trinidad, and bounded on the south by the Guayana Shield. This Guayana shield supplied fine-grained clastic sediments, which with the subsidence, formed a regional negative gravity anomaly and growth faults. Oil and gas discoveries from the Pliocene Moruga Group include Teak (1968), Samaan (1971), Poui (1972) and Galeota. These fields are mainly faulted anticline traps producing from depths of subsea, with Teak possessing a hydrocarbon column almost thick.

The Northern Range is an Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous range of metamorphic rocks striking east and dipping south. The range&#x27;s southern boundary is marked by a fault extending from the El Pilar Fault System in Venezuela. South of this fault is the Northern Basin, or Caroni Syncline, consisting of Tertiary sedimentary rocks unconformably overlying Jurassic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks. South of this basin is the Central Range, consisting of Upper Tertiary sedimentary rocks lying unconformably atop Lower Eocene and Paleocene rocks. South of this range is the Naparima Plain, a thrust belt of Oligocene and Lower Tertiary beds. 

Hydrocarbon bearing anticlines include those associated with Pitch Lake, Forest Reserve, Point Fortin, Penal, Barrackpore, and Balata Fields. The Los Bajos Fault is a wrench fault, with Lower Pliocene displacement of 6.51 miles, bordered on the north by the Siparia syncline, and on the south by the Erin syncline. Finally, the Southern Range consists of anticlinal folds, including the Rock Dome-Herrera anticline and the Moruga-West Field. East of this Rock Dome are en echelon folds containing the Lizard Springs Field. South of these folds is another fold trend containing the Moruga-East, Guayaguayare, Beach, and Galeota Fields. South of the Morne Diablo-Quinam Erin Field westward is a strongly folded anticline associated with shale diapirism, which extends west southwestward to the Pedernales Field in southeast Venezuela. The northeast portion of the Southern Range separates into a northern trend containing the Lizard Springs, Navette, and Mayaro Fields, while the southern trend contains the Beach Field.

==Recreation==
Trinidad is considered one of the best places in the world to catch Atlantic tarpon.

<text>A W engine is a type of piston engine where three or four cylinder banks use the same crankshaft, resembling the letter W when viewed from the front.

W engines with three banks of cylinders are also called &quot;broad arrow&quot; engines, due to their shape resembling the British government broad arrow property mark.

The most common W-type engine is the 4-bank type, with the Volkswagen Group experimenting with the Passat W8 and it’s 4.0 liter, 4-bank W8 engine and later implementing the concept with their Bentley division, creating a 6.0 liter W12 in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged variants. Due to the pre-existing VR-type engine only needing one cylinder head despite having two banks of cylinders, a Volkswagen 4-bank W-type engine is structured more similarly to a conventional 2-bank Vee engine as opposed to a “true” W engine.

W engines are significantly less common than V engines. Compared with a V engine, a W engine is typically shorter but wider. In Volkswagen’s case, this allows for superior packaging in engine compartments intended for 6 and 8 cylinder engines, the Passat W8 being one such example.

== W3 engines ==
One of the first W engines was the Anzani 3-cylinder, built in 1906, to be used in Anzani motorcycles. It is this W3 engine which also powered the 1909 Blériot XI, the first airplane to fly across the English Channel.

The &quot;Feuling W3&quot; is a motorcycle engine that was built by an aftermarket parts company in the United States in the early 2000s. Like radial aircraft engines it has a master connecting rod and two slave rods connected to the pistons.

== W6 engines ==
The Rumpler Tropfenwagen had a Siemens and Halske-built overhead valve W6 engine, with three banks of paired cylinders, all working on a common crankshaft.

== W8 engines ==
The sole W8 engine to reach production is the Volkswagen Group W8 engine automotive engine, which used a four-bank design and was produced from 2001-2004.

== W12 engines ==

W12 engines with three banks of four cylinders were used by several aircraft engines from 1917 until the 1930s. A three-bank W12 design was also used unsuccessfully by the Life F1 team in the 1990 Formula One season, failing to qualify at every race.

Although less commonly used in automobiles than V12 engines, a W12 petrol engine has been produced by Volkswagen Group since 2001. This four-bank engine—based on two VR6 engines with a common crankshaft—has been used in various cars sold under the Audi, Bentley and Volkswagen brands and has appeared in multiple variants, including a rare 6.3L normally aspirated version only available in the D4 Audi A8 L.

== W16 engines ==
W16 engines are rarely produced, with the notable exception of the Volkswagen Group 8.0 WR16 engine that has been used since 2005. The W16 type of engine can also be found in the Bugatti Veyron, Chiron, Divo and their related models.

== W18 engines ==
The W18 layout is rarely used, with the only production examples being several aircraft during the 1920s and 1930s, and CRM Motori SpA marine engines.

== W24 engine ==
The Allison V-3420, manufactured by the Allison Engine Company, is an example of a W24 engine.

== W30 engine ==
The Chrysler A57 multibank, essentially five Chrysler flathead engines driving one output shaft through a gear train, saw action during World War II. Developed in 1941, it would be used inside variants of the M3 Lee and M4 Sherman tanks, all deployed on the Western Front. The A57 is the only example of a five-bank W configuration.

<text>François-Joseph Ribart de Chamoust (&quot;fl.&quot; 1776–1783) was an 18th-century French architect and architectural writer. His first names are unsure but are likely to be François-Joseph, though he has also been called Charles François.

==Architectural career==
In 1758, Ribart planned an addition to the Champs-Élysées in Paris, to be constructed where the Arc de Triomphe now stands. It consisted of three levels, to be built in the shape of an elephant, with entry via a spiral staircase in the underbelly. The building was to have a form of air conditioning, and furniture that folded into the walls. A drainage system was to be incorporated into the elephant&#x27;s trunk. The French Government, however, was not amused and turned him down. Napoleon would later conceive a similar construction, the Elephant of the Bastille.

Little of his work now survives.

<doc id="452920" wikidata="Q1131614" url="?curid=452920" title="Anti-tank rifle">
<text>An anti-tank rifle is an anti-materiel rifle designed to penetrate the armor of armored fighting vehicles, most commonly tanks, armored personnel carriers, and infantry fighting vehicles. The term is usually used for weapons that can be carried and used by one person, but is sometimes used for larger weapons. The usefulness of rifles for this purpose ran from the introduction of tanks in World War I until the Korean War. While medium and heavy tank armor became too thick to be penetrated by rigid projectiles from rifles that could be carried by a single soldier, anti-tank rifles continued to be used against other &quot;soft&quot; targets, though recoilless rifles and rocket-propelled grenades such as the bazooka were also introduced for infantry close-layer defense against tanks.

== History ==
The tug of war between armour and projectiles had been developing for a long while among naval vessels, since the advent of the ironclad. It wasn&#x27;t until soldiers met armoured vehicles that the conflict of infantry firearms and armour began. The introduction of armoured cars and tanks resulted in the development of the first anti-tank weapons, among the first of which were high-powered rifles. These had appeared in the 19th century for big-game hunting. The anti-tank rifle followed the same route: a large bullet with a high velocity and the ability to penetrate armour.

=== World War I ===

The first tanks, beginning with the British Mark I launched against the German trenches in World War I, were nearly impregnable to ordinary rifle fire. Most armoured cars were similarly protected, but troops rarely faced armoured cars, as they could not navigate the landscape of trench warfare very well. Though tanks and armoured cars were vulnerable to artillery, mortars, and grenades, infantry was at a significant disadvantage when facing armoured fighting vehicles since they had no effective direct fire weapon, with the exception of the ubiquitous trench mortar, improvised on the spot. In the direct fire mode, this weapon was manhandled by German infantry over the front of a trench wall and fired at low angles by eye at approaching enemy vehicles. Though somewhat effective, these actions were obviously very hazardous to any desperate mortar crew as their exposure could attract enemy fire.

The first attempt at boosting penetrating power was the so-called &#x27;reversed bullet&#x27;. This used the same cartridge and bullet as the regular round, but the bullet was &quot;reversed&quot; and an increased propelling charge was used. The next development was a special armour-piercing bullet, the K bullet (in German &quot;Patrone SmK Kurz 7.92 mm&quot;), which could also be fired from the regular infantry rifle. It had an increased propelling charge and a steel core bullet. This had about a 30% chance of penetrating the 8 mm armour of contemporary tanks if it struck the armour at a perpendicular angle.

Both types had their specific advantages and disadvantages: for example, the K bullet was more expensive to produce and therefore was generally only issued to snipers and other advanced marksmen who could use it more effectively; the ordinary infantryman had to make do with reversed bullets, which were far less effective and had to be used in closer proximity to the target. In addition, both types of round damaged the rifles due to the higher propellant load and the resulting higher muzzle velocities and pressures: firstly, service life of the rifle barrel was decreased significantly because of the increased wear. Secondly, the higher pressure created in the chamber could jam the bolt, leading to the extractor claw failing to extract the cartridge and only breaking off the cartridge rim, leaving it stuck in the chamber. The strain of firing the increased charge could also burst the chamber of weaker and older rifles, at best destroying the rifle and at worst injuring or killing the rifleman. For these reasons, the K bullet and reversed bullet were not popular with the troops. Nevertheless, it gave the infantry a chance to stop a tank in an emergency, or at least injure or kill some of the crew if a bullet penetrated.

Even as the rounds were introduced, tanks were being designed and built with thicker armour rendering these rounds largely ineffective, though they remained in use against the older designs and armoured cars. Hence, a purpose-built weapon was required to counter the newer tanks.

The first purposely-designed infantry anti-tank rifle was designed by Germany. The Mauser 1918 T-Gewehr large-calibre (13.2 mm) rifle was capable of penetrating the armour of the newer generations of tanks and allowed a chance at stopping them. The high recoil of the rifle was very hard on the firer, sometimes breaking the collar bone or dislocating the shoulder. Although the rifle was unique to its role, it was a development of the Mauser rifles and high-powered British sporting rifles that had preceded it. The 13.2 x 92 mm (0.52 in) cartridge was not unusual either, as some 0.50-inch firearms had already been fielded in land warfare with the relatively new and more powerful (as compared to black powder) smokeless powders of the era.

At the same time, in the US, a half-inch high velocity round was being developed for use against aircraft. It would be used with the Browning-designed .50 calibre machine gun. This round was upscaled from current US .30-06 calibre infantry ammunition. When word of the German anti-tank shell spread, there was some debate as to whether it should be copied and used as a base for the new machine gun cartridge. However, after some analysis the German ammunition was ruled out, as its performance was inferior to the modified Springfield .30-06 round and was semi-rimmed, making it difficult to feed into an automatic weapon. The Browning M2 .50 cal machine gun would go on to function as an anti-armour machine gun.

=== World War II ===
At the start of World War II, only some European nations had an anti-tank rifle based on a high-velocity, large-calibre round. The first combat use of anti-tank rifles took place during the Polish Campaign in September 1939. The karabin przeciwpancerny wz.&quot; &quot;35 was used extensively by Polish army and after the campaign ended, captured rifles were put into service with several Axis armies. The wz.&quot; &quot;35 using the 7.92×107mm&quot; &quot;DS anti-tank ammunition proved to be an effective weapon against all German tanks of the period (the Panzer I, II and III, as well as the Czechoslovak-made Panzer&quot; &quot;35(t) and Panzer&quot; &quot;38(t)). At up to , it was able to immobilize all lightly armoured vehicles. It could penetrate of armour, sloped at 30° at distance, or of armour at .

In later years of the war, as armour became thicker on newer tanks, the effectiveness of a man-portable rifle lessened. This was particularly true in Malaya, where the light Japanese tanks specially configured for jungle conflict rode roughshod over British forces supplied with the Boys anti-tank rifle. At first small cannons up to 20mm calibre were used, but the anti-tank role soon required more powerful weapons which were based on the application of chemical energy in the form of the shaped charge anti-tank rifle grenade. To these were added rocket launchers such as the bazooka, recoilless rifles such as the Panzerfaust, and rocket-propelled grenades — some anti-armour successes were achieved with heavy-calibre autocannon by the Luftwaffe, especially with the &quot;Bordkanone&quot; BK 3,7 autocannon, mounted in twin gun pods against Soviet armour on the Eastern Front. Some anti-tank rifles, like the Finnish L-39, were still used by snipers to harass the enemy, like firing phosphorus bullets at tanks&#x27; open hatches, or to smoke an enemy sniper out of his position.

=== Korean War ===
The Soviet PTRS-41 and PTRD of World War II vintage were used by North Korean and Chinese forces during the Korean War as they lacked more modern infantry anti-tank weapons.

=== Cold War and modern day ===
Although retaining many of the technical characteristics of the anti-tank rifles, the Cold War era weapons are only conceptual descendants of anti-tank weapons wielded by the Second World War infantry, and both large-calibre sniper rifles and anti-materiel rifles owe only some part of their design heritage to them.

Although no longer capable of penetrating even the side armour of modern main battle tanks, they are capable of causing serious damage to their external fittings such as periscopes, optics, sensors, tank treads, and machine guns. For example, the Croatian RT-20 was developed to destroy thermal sights on Serbian tanks. They are also useful in disabling or even destroying lesser armoured rear units and support vehicles, helicopters, low-flying UAVs and personnel.

<doc id="452921" wikidata="Q7494713" url="?curid=452921" title="Sherbet (band)">
<text>Sherbet (aka Highway or The Sherbs) was one of the most successful Australian rock bands of the 1970s. The &#x27;classic line-up&#x27; of Daryl Braithwaite on vocals, Tony Mitchell on bass guitar, Garth Porter on keyboards, Alan Sandow on drums, and Clive Shakespeare on guitar provided their teen-oriented pop style. In 1976 Shakespeare left and was soon replaced by Harvey James. Sherbet&#x27;s biggest singles were &quot;Summer Love&quot; (1975) and &quot;Howzat&quot; (1976), both reaching number one in Australia. &quot;Howzat&quot; was also a top 5 hit in the United Kingdom. The band was less successful in the United States, where &quot;Howzat&quot; peaked at No. 61. As The Sherbs they also reached No. 61 in 1981 with &quot;I Have the Skill&quot;. The group disbanded in 1984. Subsequent re-unions have occurred since 1998.

According to rock music historian, Ian McFarlane, &quot;alongside Skyhooks, Sherbet was the most successful Australian pop band of the 1970s. With a run of 20 consecutive hit singles to its credit, and 17 albums that yielded ten platinum and 40 gold disc awards, Sherbet was the first domestic act to sell a million dollars&#x27; worth of records in Australia&quot;. In 1990 Sherbet were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame alongside classical composer and pianist, Percy Grainger. On 15 January 2011 Harvey James died of lung cancer. On 15 February 2012 Clive Shakespeare died of prostate cancer. On 23 January 2019 founding vocalist Denis Loughlin died after being diagnosed with cancer.

==History==
From 1970 until 1984 Sherbet scored 20 hit singles in Australia (including two number ones) and released ten platinum status albums. The single &quot;Howzat&quot; which was a number-one hit in 1976, also reached number four on the UK Singles Chart. They were the first Australian band to reach $1 million in record sales in Australia, and they pioneered the concept of massive regional tours. In December 1976, the book &quot;Sherbet on Tour&quot;, by Christie Eliezer, sold 30,000 copies in its first week.

===Formation and early years (1969–1972)===
Sherbet was formed in Sydney in April 1969, with Glasgow-born Denis Loughlin (ex-Sebastian Hardie Blues Band, Clapham Junction) on vocals, Doug Rea (ex Downtown Roll Band) on bass guitar, Sammy See (ex Clapham Junction) on organ, guitar and vocals, Clive Shakespeare (ex-Downtown Roll Band) on lead guitar and vocals, and Danny Taylor (ex Downtown Roll Band) on drums. Initially they were a soul band, playing Motown covers and rock-based material. Alan Sandow (ex-Daisy Roots) had replaced Taylor on drums by July. Sherbet signed to the Infinity Records label, a subsidiary of Festival Records. In March 1970, the band&#x27;s debut single was issued, a cover version of Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Crimson Ships&quot;, from that band&#x27;s January 1970 album &quot;Magic Christian Music&quot;.

During 1970, the band played a residency at Jonathon&#x27;s Disco, playing seven hours a night, four days a week for eight months. They were spotted by their future manager, Roger Davies. By March Daryl Braithwaite (Bright Lights, House of Bricks, Samael Lilith) had joined, initially sharing lead vocals with Loughlin who left the band a few months later. Braithwaite&#x27;s former bandmate Bruce Worrall (Bright Lights, House of Bricks, Samael Lilith) took over from Rea on bass guitar. By year&#x27;s end the group undertook their first national tour. See had left in October to join The Flying Circus and was replaced by New Zealand-born Garth Porter (Samael Lilith, Toby Jugg) who provided Hammond organ and electric piano.

In 1971, Sherbet entered Australia&#x27;s prestigious national rock band contest, Hoadley&#x27;s Battle of the Sounds, and won the New South Wales final but lost the national final to Adelaide-based band Fraternity (led by Bon Scott later in AC/DC). They entered again in 1972 and won the national final, previous winners include The Twilights (1966) and The Groove (1968), which went on to achieve major commercial success.

Sherbet&#x27;s first chart hits on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40 were covers of Blue Mink&#x27;s &quot;Can You Feel It Baby?&quot; (September 1971), Delaney and Bonnie&#x27;s &quot;Free the People&quot; (February 1972) and Ted Mulry&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re All Woman&quot; (September 1972). Most of their early recordings were produced by Festival&#x27;s in-house producer Richard Batchens, who later produced albums and singles for another Infinity label mate, Richard Clapton. The band increased its profile with prestigious support slots on major tours by visiting international acts including Gary Glitter and The Jackson 5.

===Rise to stardom (1972–1975)===

In January 1972, Sherbet&#x27;s &#x27;classic line-up&#x27; was in place when Tony Mitchell replaced Worrall on bass guitar: the band now consisted of lead vocalist Braithwaite, keyboardist Porter, drummer Sandow, bassist Mitchell and guitarist Shakespeare. The band had evolved from a soul-based covers band into a teen-oriented pop, rock outfit that relied mostly on original material. Nevertheless, they released occasional covers throughout the 1970s, including Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; and Free&#x27;s &quot;Wishing Well&quot;. From 1972 to 1976, Sherbet&#x27;s chief songwriting team of Porter and Shakespeare were responsible for co-writing the lion&#x27;s share of the band&#x27;s material, which combined British pop and American soul influences.

Sherbet issued their debut album, &quot;Time Change... A Natural Progression&quot;, in December 1972 on Infinity Records. Also that month the band were voted &#x27;Most Popular Australian Group&#x27; by readers of &quot;Go-Set&quot; in their annual pop poll. The album&#x27;s accompanying single &quot;You&#x27;ve Got the Gun&quot;, written by Shakespeare, Porter and Braithwaite, was Sherbet&#x27;s first self-penned A-side, and peaked at No. 29 in January 1973.

In December 1973, the band hit the &quot;Go-Set&quot; Top 10 for the first time with the Porter and Shakespeare original, &quot;Cassandra&quot;. It was issued in October ahead of their second album, &quot;On with the Show&quot; released in November, which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; Top 20 Australian Albums Chart in February 1974. It was followed by &quot;Slipstream&quot; which reached No. 7 on &quot;Go-Set&quot;″s National Top 40 in August. A string of hits followed on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart (replaced &quot;Go-Set&quot; charts after August), with Sherbet releasing original Top 10 hits such as &quot;Silvery Moon&quot; (1974) and their first number-one hit &quot;Summer Love&quot; (1975). A total of 11 Sherbet songs reached the Australian top 10.

The band were the darlings of Australia&#x27;s teenyboppers: for six years in a row they were voted &#x27;Most Popular Australian Group&#x27; by readers of &quot;TV Week&quot; for their King of Pop Awards from 1973 to 1978. From 1975 they made more appearances on national TV pop show &quot;Countdown&quot; than any other band in the programme&#x27;s history. Band members – especially Braithwaite – often appeared as co-hosts. According to contemporary musician, Dave Warner, &quot;[t]hey had a clean-cut boys-next door image; a big contrast to the bad boy, weirdo, heavy-riff persona favoured by their peers&quot;. Sherbet&#x27;s albums also charted on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart with October 1974&#x27;s &quot;Slipstream&quot; peaking at No. 5, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Life... Is for Living&quot; reached No. 6, and their first compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-75&quot;, from 1975 became their first number-one album.

From 1974, Braithwaite maintained a parallel solo career with Sherbet members often playing on his solo singles. Braithwaite was voted &#x27;King of Pop&#x27; for three successive years, 1975 to 1977. Beginning in 1975, Sherbet&#x27;s records were produced by Richard Lush who had started as a trainee engineer at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios, where he helped engineer some of The Beatles&#x27; recordings including &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Porter began to take an occasional lead vocal on Sherbet singles, including &quot;Hollywood Dreaming&quot; and &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;. Throughout this era, Sherbet toured Australia regularly and with remarkable thoroughness; they were one of the few bands to consistently commit to playing full-scale concerts in regional areas of the country.

The idea for the satin bomber jackets came from Garth Porter. He got an American baseball jacket in an Op Shop. When they were having their clothes designed (by Richard Tyler), Garth said: &quot;If you&#x27;re going to make me anything just make me something like this,&quot; showing him the satin bomber jacket. Before they knew what was happening, the trend took hold and everybody in the band was having them made up to their own requirements. Their management then went as far as using it as a marketing tool for the band.

===International success (1976–1979)===
In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing &#x27;personal reasons&#x27;. He later explained &quot;I couldn&#x27;t even go out the front of my house because there were all these girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don&#x27;t want to discuss fully … but let&#x27;s just say I wasn&#x27;t happy about where all the money went&quot;. The last single he played on was &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, which was a No. 5 hit in February. Shakespeare was briefly replaced by journeyman guitarist Gunther Gorman (ex-Home) but within weeks a more permanent replacement, Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel) joined. Meanwhile, Mitchell had stepped up to join Porter as Sherbet&#x27;s new main songwriting team. The pair were responsible for penning &quot;Howzat&quot; (1976), the band&#x27;s only international hit, which was inspired by the sport of cricket. The song&#x27;s success led to an extensive international tour in 1976-77. &quot;Howzat&quot; went to number one in Australia, and in New Zealand, it was a Top 10 hit in several European countries – including number four on the UK Singles Chart, number six in The Netherlands, and number eight in Norway. It reached the top 10 in South Africa, South-East Asia, and Israel. The single had less chart success in the United States where it reached No. 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album of the same name also made No. 1 in Australia, No. 12 in New Zealand, but failed to chart in the US.

In 1976, the release of the double A-sided single &quot;Rock Me Gently/You&#x27;ve Got the Gun&quot; saw the record company place full page ads in &quot;Billboard&quot;. The promotion went on to state the band had a sound &quot;as sophisticated pop/rock along the lines of Chicago or Three Dog Night&quot;. It goes on to say the single has &quot;the unique distinction of having received heavy airplay before it was shipped&quot;.

Hoping to achieve further international success, from 1977, Sherbet spent several years trying to make an impact in the US. Their 1977 album &quot;Photoplay&quot; was retitled &quot;Magazine&quot; for US release, and featured an elaborate gate-fold packaging. Though &quot;Photoplay&quot; and its lead single, &quot;Magazine Madonna&quot;, were successful in Australia – both reached No. 3 on their respective charts – the retitled &quot;Magazine&quot; LP failed to chart in the US as did the associated single. In the same year Sherbet provided the soundtrack for the buddy comedy, &quot;High Rolling&quot;. With US success proving elusive, the band&#x27;s label RSO Records felt that the lightweight name Sherbet may have hurt their chances. Accordingly, their US-recorded self-titled album, was issued in the US under a new group name, Highway, and re-titled as &quot;Highway 1&quot; – despite the change it also flopped.

By this time the band&#x27;s career in Australia had begun to decline. Though the &quot;Sherbet&quot; album peaked at No. 3, &quot;Another Night on the Road&quot; (1978) was Sherbet&#x27;s final top 10 Australian hit. The band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Beg, Steal or Borrow&quot; missed the chart completely, and January 1979&#x27;s &quot;Angela&quot; – from the soundtrack to the film &quot;Snapshot&quot; – reached the top 100 - but only just.

The group&#x27;s Australian success was on the wane, and either as Sherbet or as Highway, they were unable to come up with a follow-up international hit to &quot;Howzat&quot;. Frustrated by the career downturn, after issuing a final single in Australia as Highway – &quot;Heart Get Ready&quot; – which flopped at No. 89, the band broke up in mid-1979. Throughout the 1970s, the group was managed by Roger Davies. The group briefly reunited for the &quot;Concert of the Decade&quot; held on 4 November 1979 at the Sydney Opera House and sponsored by radio station 2SM – an edited hour of concert footage was broadcast by the Nine Network under the same name and a double-LP was issued on Mushroom Records later that month. During the concert, Mitchell also supplied bass guitar for Neale Johns&#x27; set (see Blackfeather) and then Stevie Wright&#x27;s rendition of his solo hit &quot;Evie&quot;.

===The Sherbs era (1980–1984)===
The break-up did not last long. In 1980, Sherbet reconvened as The Sherbs with exactly the same personnel they had before the split: Braithwaite, Harvey, Mitchell, Porter and Sandow. The new renamed iteration of the group also changed their approach, as they now featured a somewhat modified progressive new wave sound. This version of the band had some minor success in America, but their almost complete lack of chart action in Australia was in stark contrast to their 1970s heyday.

The Sherbs&#x27; first album &quot;The Skill&quot; was released in October 1980 and reached the top half of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was the first album by the group – under any of their names – to chart in the US. An accompanying single, &quot;I Have the Skill&quot;, became the band&#x27;s second US pop chart hit at No. 61. The Sherbs also appeared on the inaugural AOR-oriented Rock Tracks chart issued by &quot;Billboard&quot; in March 1981: &quot;I Have the Skill&quot; debuted at No. 45. The track peaked at No. 14 – the band&#x27;s highest position on any US chart, and The Sherbs also received airplay on US album-oriented rock (AOR) radio stations with &quot;No Turning Back&quot;. However, none of the singles from &quot;The Skill&quot; reached the Australian Kent Music Report top 100, a huge comedown for a band that had been major charting artists in Australia only two years earlier.

The Sherbs&#x27;s second album, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, followed in 1981, but failed to produce a single that charted in the either the US or Australian top 100. The band did, however, chart on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Rock Tracks Chart with the album cut &quot;We Ride Tonight&quot; peaking at No. 26 in 1982. The track&#x27;s mild AOR success was not enough to ignite album sales in the US, though, and &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; only reached No. 202 on the album charts. A mini-album, &quot;Shaping Up&quot;, appeared in 1982. It was critically well received and spawned two minor hits in Australia, but the US issue missed the chart completely. The Sherbs were now in a position where the US listening public were largely indifferent to their releases, and – despite their newer, more contemporary sound – the Australian audience had seemingly written them off as a relic of the 1970s. Porter has said that he found this especially frustrating, as he felt The Sherbs were actually writing and performing better material during this era than in their 1970s heyday.

James left The Sherbs at the end of 1982 to be replaced by Tony Leigh (Harry Young and Sabbath, Gillian Eastoe Band) on guitar. In late 1983, the group announced their decision to disband in 1984, they reverted to Sherbet and undertook a successful farewell tour of Australia and a final single, &quot;Tonight Will Last Forever&quot;. Shakespeare returned to co-write and appear on the final single. Both Shakespeare and James rejoined Sherbet on the final tour. Following the group&#x27;s break-up, Braithwaite continued his solo career in Australia, and Porter and Shakespeare each became successful record producers. In 1990 Sherbet were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame alongside classical composer and pianist, Percy Grainger.

===Reunions (1998–2011)===
Sherbet have reunited on occasion over subsequent years. Their first reunion was an ABC-TV special on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1998. They performed &quot;Howzat&quot; and &quot;Summer Love&quot; without Sandow – John Watson (ex-Kevin Borich Band, Australian Crawl) filled in on drums. On 10 March 2001 with Sandow on board, the band reunited for &quot;Gimme Ted&quot; – a benefit concert for Ted Mulry, with two songs recorded for the associated 2×DVD tribute album released in May 2003. In June 2003 Sherbet performed at another benefit show for Wane Jarvis (a former roadie).

At the May 2006 Logie Awards Sherbet reunited as a six-piece: Braithwaite, James, Mitchell, Porter, Sandow and Shakespeare, where they performed &quot;Howzat&quot;. The band played three shows in late August 2006 billed as Daryl Braithwaite and Highway. They followed by joining the Countdown Spectacular tour throughout Australia during September and October. 2006 also saw the release of two newly recorded tracks on the compilation album, &quot;Sherbet – Super Hits&quot;, &quot;Red Dress&quot; (Porter, Shakespeare, Braithwaite, Mitchell, James, Sandow) and &quot;Hearts Are Insane&quot; (Porter), both produced by Ted Howard.

2007 saw the release of a live compilation on CD and DVD entitled &quot;Live – And the Crowd Went Wild&quot; encompassing material recorded in the 1970s at shows in Sydney, Melbourne and the UK. Sherbet performed on the Countdown Spectacular 2 in August and September. On 15 January 2011 Harvey James died of lung cancer – the remaining members except Shakespeare, who was too ill, performed at Gimme that Guitar, a tribute concert for James on 17 February. This was the last performance by Sherbet to date.

On 15 February 2012 Clive Shakespeare died of prostate cancer. Founding vocalist Denis Loughlin (28 July 194923 January 2019) died after contracting cancer.

<text>The Stanford Graduate School of Business is the graduate business school of Stanford University, a private research university in Stanford, California. Stanford GSB is a member of the M7, an informal network of business schools regarded as among the most prestigious in the United States. For several years it has been the most selective business school in the United States, admitting only about 6% of applicants.

Stanford GSB offers a general management Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, the MSx Program (MS in Management for mid-career executives), Stanford LEAD Online Business Program and a PhD program, along with joint degrees with other schools at Stanford including Earth Sciences, Education, Engineering, Law and Medicine.

==History==
The school was founded in 1925 when trustee Herbert Hoover formed a committee consisting of Wallace Alexander, George Rolph, Paul Shoup, Thomas Gregory, and Milton Esberg to secure the needed funds for the school&#x27;s founding. Willard Hotchkiss became the first dean of Stanford GSB.

The library was formally inaugurated on April 3, 1933. The collection was established with 1,000 volumes and assorted reports. The school moved from Jordan Hall to new quarters in the History Corner of the Main Quad in 1937.

Jonathan Levin was appointed as the 10th dean of the school in September 2016. Levin became the 13th president of Stanford University on August 1, 2024.

==Campus==

The Knight Management Center is situated within the greater Stanford campus. There are ten buildings at the Knight Management Center: the Gunn Building, Zambrano Hall, North Building, Arbuckle Dining Pavilion, Bass Center, the Faculty Buildings (comprising East and West buildings), the Patterson Building, the MBA Class of 1968 Building, and the McClelland Building.

The Schwab Residential Center was designed by Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. The 158,000 square-foot facility consists of 280 guest rooms. Jack McDonald Hall, located adjacent to Schwab, opened in 2016 as an additional residence for MBA students with over 200 guest rooms.

There are three main art installations on campus, including Monument to Change as it Changes, Monument to the Unknown Variables, and Ways to Change.

Stanford GSB maintains very close links with the venture capital, finance and technology firms of nearby Silicon Valley.

==Academics==
Stanford GSB offers a traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) program typically completed in two years, a Master of Science (&quot;MSx program&quot;) typically completed in one year, and a doctoral (PhD) program. The MBA program is a full-time graduate program that enrolls approximately 420 students each year.

The MSx program is intended for students who are mid-career managers (minimum 8 years of professional work experience). The Stanford MSx was previously called the Stanford Sloan Master&#x27;s Program, because students in the program are known as Stanford Sloan Fellows. The Stanford MSx is one of the three Sloan Fellows programs, sharing a similar format with the others at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the London Business School. These programs were initially supported by Alfred P. Sloan, Chairman of General Motors from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship in his alma mater of MIT in 1931.

===Academic partnerships===
Stanford GSB offers Executive Education programs jointly with Harvard Business School. It also offers one of the three Sloan Fellows programs, coordinating with the others at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the London Business School.

===Stanford LEAD Professional Certificate===

The Stanford LEAD Business Program (LEAD is an acronym for learn, engage, accelerate, and disrupt) is a one-year online business program in the Graduate School of Business offering access to curricular materials and students specialize personal leadership. The teaching components are coordinated 100% online although there are periodic meet-ups hosted at Stanford each year through the me2we program. The annual me2we conferences have grown to become quite large, and the program&#x27;s 1,800 LEAD alumni can join remotely.

==Faculty and research==
The school works at the forefront of global business research and teaching. There are four winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences on the faculty (William F. Sharpe 1990, Myron Scholes 1997, Michael Spence 2001, Guido Imbens 2021), five recipients of the John Bates Clark Award, 19 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and four members of the National Academy of Sciences.

William F. Sharpe&#x27;s research interests focus on macro-investment analysis, equilibrium in capital markets and the provision of income in retirement. Myron Scholes&#x27; research has focused on understanding uncertainty and its effect on asset prices and the value of options, including flexibility options. Michael Spence&#x27;s research interests focus on the study of economic growth and development, dynamic competition and the economics of information.

==Rankings==
In recent rankings, Stanford GSB was ranked 1st by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek,&quot; 1st by &quot;QS Top Universities&quot;, and 1st by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. In the ranking aggregator &quot;Poets &amp; Quants&quot; Stanford&#x27;s MBA Program was ranked 1st in the U.S. In the inaugural LinkedIn MBA rankings (2024), Stanford was ranked #1 globally. 

The Stanford Graduate School of Business is the most selective business school in the United States. It has maintained the highest ratio of &quot;applicants to available seats&quot; of any business school in the U.S. for the last decade. It has also had the lowest acceptance rates (typically &lt;7%) of any business school. For the Class of 2022 which entered in 2020, 8% of applicants were offered admission, and the average GMAT score of 733 and average GPA of 3.8 are the highest of any business school in the world.

The business school comprises the Knight Management Center, the Schwab Residential Center (named after alumnus Charles R. Schwab, founder and chairman of the Charles Schwab Corporation), and Highland Hall.

==Donations==

In August 2006, the school announced what was then the largest gift ever to a business school—$105 million from Stanford alumnus Phil Knight, MBA &#x27;62, co-founder and chairman of Nike, Inc. The gift went toward construction of a $375 million campus, called the Knight Management Center, for the business school. Construction was completed in 2011.

In 2011, alumnus Robert King and his wife Dorothy made a $150 million gift to the school—making history as the largest donation to Stanford GSB—to found the Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies (also known as SEED) to focus on poverty relief in emerging markets. A portion of their gift is used as a matching incentive to encourage other donors to give to SEED.

The gifts by King and Knight are marked as the second and third largest philanthropic pledges to a business school.

Also in 2011, investor and economist Marko Dimitrijevic, a 1985 alumni of the Business School, established the Emerging Markets Innovation Fund, to support teaching, research, and other initiatives in the area of emerging and frontier markets.

== Alumni ==
There are 33,689 living alumni, including 21,111 living MBA alumni. MBA alumni include 23 billionaires and several heads of state.

<doc id="452950" wikidata="Q1545916" url="?curid=452950" title="Limit cycle">
<text>In mathematics, in the study of dynamical systems with two-dimensional phase space, a limit cycle is a closed trajectory in phase space having the property that at least one other trajectory spirals into it either as time approaches infinity or as time approaches negative infinity. Such behavior is exhibited in some nonlinear systems. Limit cycles have been used to model the behavior of many real-world oscillatory systems. The study of limit cycles was initiated by Henri Poincaré (1854–1912).

==Definition==
We consider a two-dimensional dynamical system of the form
formula_1
where
formula_2
is a smooth function. A &quot;trajectory&quot; of this system is some smooth function formula_3 with values in formula_4 which satisfies this differential equation. Such a trajectory is called &quot;closed&quot; (or &quot;periodic&quot;) if it is not constant but returns to its starting point, i.e. if there exists some formula_5 such that formula_6 for all formula_7. An orbit is the image of a trajectory, a subset of formula_8. A &quot;closed orbit&quot;, or &quot;cycle&quot;, is the image of a closed trajectory. A &quot;limit cycle&quot; is a cycle which is the limit set of some other trajectory.

==Properties==
By the Jordan curve theorem, every closed trajectory divides the plane into two regions, the interior and the exterior of the curve.

Given a limit cycle and a trajectory in its interior that approaches the limit cycle for time approaching formula_9, then there is a neighborhood around the limit cycle such that &quot;all&quot; trajectories in the interior that start in the neighborhood approach the limit cycle for time approaching formula_10. The corresponding statement holds for a trajectory in the interior that approaches the limit cycle for time approaching formula_11, and also for trajectories in the exterior approaching the limit cycle.

==Stable, unstable and semi-stable limit cycles==
In the case where all the neighboring trajectories approach the limit cycle as time approaches infinity, it is called a &quot;stable&quot; or &quot;attractive&quot; limit cycle (ω-limit cycle). If instead, all neighboring trajectories approach it as time approaches negative infinity, then it is an &quot;unstable&quot; limit cycle (α-limit cycle). If there is a neighboring trajectory which spirals into the limit cycle as time approaches infinity, and another one which spirals into it as time approaches negative infinity, then it is a &quot;semi-stable&quot; limit cycle. There are also limit cycles that are neither stable, unstable nor semi-stable: for instance, a neighboring trajectory may approach the limit cycle from the outside, but the inside of the limit cycle is approached by a family of other cycles (which would not be limit cycles).

Stable limit cycles are examples of attractors. They imply self-sustained oscillations: the closed trajectory describes the perfect periodic behavior of the system, and any small perturbation from this closed trajectory causes the system to return to it, making the system stick to the limit cycle.

==Finding limit cycles==
Every closed trajectory contains within its interior a stationary point of the system, i.e. a point formula_12 where formula_13. The Bendixson–Dulac theorem and the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem predict the absence or existence, respectively, of limit cycles of two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems.

==Open problems==
Finding limit cycles, in general, is a very difficult problem. The number of limit cycles of a polynomial differential equation in the plane is the main object of the second part of Hilbert&#x27;s sixteenth problem. It is unknown, for instance, whether there is any system formula_14 in the plane where both components of formula_15 are quadratic polynomials of the two variables, such that the system has more than 4 limit cycles.

== Applications ==
Limit cycles are important in many scientific applications where systems with self-sustained oscillations are modelled. Some examples include:

* Aerodynamic limit-cycle oscillations
* The Hodgkin–Huxley model for action potentials in neurons.
* The Sel&#x27;kov model of glycolysis.
* The daily oscillations in gene expression, hormone levels and body temperature of animals, which are part of the circadian rhythm, although this is contradicted by more recent evidence.
* The migration of cancer cells in confining micro-environments follows limit cycle oscillations.
* Some non-linear electrical circuits exhibit limit cycle oscillations, which inspired the original Van der Pol model.
*The control of respiration and hematopoiesis, as appearing in the Mackey-Glass equations.

<text>Eleanor Grace Theresa Holm (December 6, 1912 – January 31, 2004) was an American competition swimmer and Olympic gold medalist. An Olympian in 1928 and 1932, Holm was expelled from the 1936 Summer Olympics team by Avery Brundage under controversial circumstances. Holm went on to have a high-profile career as a socialite and interior designer and co-starred in a Hollywood Tarzan movie, &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Revenge&quot;.

==Biography==

Holm was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of seven children of Charlotte ( Long) and Franklin Holm, a fireman and cousin to professional basketball player Bobby Holm. She graduated from Erasmus Hall High School.

Holm learned to swim while very young. Winning her first national swimming title at age 13, Holm was selected to compete in the 1928 Summer Olympics, where she finished fifth in her specialty, the 100-meter backstroke. Holm was also talented in several other strokes, winning several American titles in the 300-yard medley event.

At the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Holm won the gold medal in her favorite event, though defending champion Marie Braun had to forfeit the final due to an insect bite. &quot;I was hardly dry at those Olympics when I was whisked from one studio to another — Warner Brothers, MGM, Paramount — to take screen tests,&quot; Holm told the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1984.

In 1932, Holm was one of the fifteen&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/517730810&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; girls named as WAMPAS Baby Stars, including Ginger Rogers, Mary Carlisle, and Gloria Stuart. One of her first assignments at Warner Bros. was to join a trainload of actors and Busby Berkeley chorus girls on a barnstorming trip across the country in early 1933 to publicize the movie musical &quot;42nd Street&quot; and to show support for the newly elected president Franklin D. Roosevelt at his first inauguration in Washington, DC.

The following year, on September 2, 1933, Holm married her first husband, Art Jarrett, a fellow graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, after a whirlwind five-month romance. He was a singer and bandleader at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub. Holm even performed with his band while wearing a white bathing suit, white cowboy hat, and high heels, singing &quot;I&#x27;m an Old Cowhand (From the Rio Grande)&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m an Old Cowhand&quot;, words and music by Johnny Mercer, was written for the 1936 movie &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot;.

Holm competed as Eleanor Holm Jarrett and qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany. After a drinking party aboard the on the way to the Olympics, the team doctor found Holm in a state approaching a coma. According to David Wallechinsky in &quot;The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics&quot;, the Olympic team doctor&#x27;s diagnosis was &quot;[a]cute alcoholism&quot;. Various charges were made against her, which Holm did not deny. U.S. Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage promptly expelled her from the Olympic team. Holm admitted to having had a few glasses of Champagne but subsequently maintained that her dismissal arose from a personal grudge held by Brundage.

Despite a petition signed by more than half the U.S. Olympic team, Brundage, who went on to become the president of the International Olympic Committee, refused to reconsider. Holm had been the top favorite for the 100-meter backstroke event, and she watched from the stands as the gold medal went to Dutch swimmer Nida Senff. Decades later, Holm told Olympic sprinter Dave Sime that Brundage held a grudge from an incident in which he propositioned her, and she turned him down.

Although she appeared in at least four films as herself, Holm appeared in only one Hollywood feature film, starring opposite fellow Olympian Glenn Morris in the 1938 film &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. On November 10, 1939, a year after Jarrett divorced her, claiming that his wife&#x27;s expulsion from the 1936 Olympics and her affair with another man had caused him embarrassment, Holm married her lover, impresario Billy Rose, who had divorced first wife Fanny Brice. At the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, Holm did 39 shows a week at Rose&#x27;s &quot;Aquacade&quot;, co-featured with Tarzan swimmer Johnny Weissmuller and, later, Buster Crabbe. In 1954, Holm divorced Rose — receiving $30,000 per month (equivalent to $ today) in alimony and a lump sum of $200,000 ($ today) to be paid in 10 yearly installments, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. This sensational divorce trial was called &quot;the war of the Roses&quot; and is the subject of a chapter in Louis Nizer&#x27;s book &quot;My Life in Court&quot;. Several months later, Holm married Thomas Joseph Whalen, an oil-drilling executive. They remained married until his death in 1986. All of the unions were childless.
In 1966, Holm was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.

Holm died of renal disease in Miami, Florida, on January 31, 2004, at the age of 91.

==In popular culture==
Holm is portrayed by Heidi O&#x27;Rourke in the 1975 film &quot;Funny Lady&quot;.

A protagonist based on Eleanor Holm, with the fictionalized name Eleanor Emerson, appears in the 2012 novel &quot;Flight from Berlin&quot; by David John, published by HarperCollins.

<doc id="452955" wikidata="Q1133673" url="?curid=452955" title="Cornerstone">
<text>A cornerstone (or foundation stone or setting stone) is the first stone set in the construction of a masonry foundation. All other stones will be set in reference to this stone, thus determining the position of the entire structure.

Over time a cornerstone became a ceremonial masonry stone, or replica, set in a prominent location on the outside of a building, with an inscription on the stone indicating the construction dates of the building and the names of architect, builder, and other significant individuals. The rite of laying a cornerstone is an important cultural component of eastern architecture and metaphorically in sacred architecture generally.

Some cornerstones include time capsules from, or engravings commemorating, the time a particular building was built.

==History==
 The ceremony typically involved the placing of offerings of grain, wine and oil on or under the stone. These were symbolic of the produce and the people of the land and the means of their subsistence. This in turn derived from the practice in still more ancient times of making an animal or human sacrifice that was laid in the foundations.

Frazer (2006: pp. 106–107) in &quot;The Golden Bough&quot; from 1890 charts the various propitiary sacrifices and effigy substitution such as the shadow, states that:

Nowhere, perhaps, does the equivalence of the shadow to the life or soul come out more clearly than in some customs practised to this day in South-eastern Europe. In modern Greece, when the foundation of a new building is being laid, it is the custom to kill a cock, a ram, or a lamb, and to let its blood flow on the foundation-stone, under which the animal is afterwards buried. The object of the sacrifice is to give strength and stability to the building. But sometimes, instead of killing an animal, the builder entices a man to the foundation-stone, secretly measures his body, or a part of it, or his shadow, and buries the measure under the foundation-stone; or he lays the foundation-stone upon the man&#x27;s shadow. It is believed that the man will die within the year. The Roumanians of Transylvania think that he whose shadow is thus immured will die within forty days; so persons passing by a building which is in course of erection may hear a warning cry, Beware lest they take thy shadow! Not long ago there were still shadow-traders whose business it was to provide architects with the shadows necessary for securing their walls. In these cases the measure of the shadow is looked on as equivalent to the shadow itself, and to bury it is to bury the life or soul of the man, who, deprived of it, must die. Thus the custom is a substitute for the old practice of immuring a living person in the walls, or crushing him under the foundation-stone of a new building, in order to give strength and durability to the structure, or more definitely in order that the angry ghost may haunt the place and guard it against the intrusion of enemies.
Ancient Japanese legends talk about Hitobashira (人柱, &quot;human pillar&quot;), in which maidens were buried alive at the base or near some constructions as a prayer to ensure the buildings against disasters or enemy attacks.

===Freemasonry===
Historically, Freemasons sometimes performed the public cornerstone laying ceremony for notable buildings. This ceremony was described by The Cork Examiner of 13 January 1865 as follows: 
...The Deputy Provincial Grand Master of Munster, applying the golden square and level to the stone said ; &quot; My Lord Bishop, the stone has been proved and found to be &#x27;fair work and square work&#x27; and fit to be laid as the foundation stone of this Holy Temple&quot;.&#x27; After this, Bishop Gregg spread cement over the stone with a trowel specially made for the occasion by John Hawkesworth, a silversmith and a jeweller. He then gave the stone three knocks with a mallet and declared the stone to be &#x27;duly and truly laid&#x27;. The Deputy Provincial Grand Master of Munster poured offerings of corn, oil and wine over the stone after Bishop Gregg had declared it to be &#x27;duly and truly laid&#x27;. The Provincial Grand Chaplain of the Masonic Order in Munster then read out the following prayer: &#x27;May the Great Architect of the universe enable us as successfully to carry out and finish this work. May He protect the workmen from danger and accident, and long preserve the structure from decay; and may He grant us all our needed supply, the corn of nourishment, the wine of refreshment, and the oil of joy, Amen. So mote it be.&#x27; The choir and congregation then sang the Hundredth Psalm. 

The initiate (Entered Apprentice) in Freemasonry is placed in the north-east corner of the Lodge as a figurative foundation stone. This is intended to signify the unity of the North associated with darkness and the East associated with light.

==Contemporary usage==

Normally, a VIP of the organization, or a local celebrity or community leader, will be invited to conduct the ceremony of figuratively beginning the foundations of the building, with the person&#x27;s name and official position and the date usually being recorded on the stone. This person is usually asked to place their hand on the stone or otherwise signify its laying.

Often still, and certainly until the 1970s, most ceremonies involved the use of a specially manufactured and engraved trowel that had a formal use in laying mortar under the stone. Similarly, a special hammer was often used to ceremonially tap the stone into place.

The foundation stone often has a cavity into which is placed a time capsule containing newspapers of the day or week of the ceremony plus other artifacts that are typical of the period of the construction: coins of the year may also be immured in the cavity or time capsule.

===Ecclesiastical===

A cornerstone (Greek: Άκρογωνιεîς, Latin: Primarii Lapidis) will sometimes be referred to as a &quot;foundation-stone&quot;, and is symbolic of Christ, whom the Apostle Paul referred to as the &quot;head of the corner&quot; and is the &quot;Chief Cornerstone of the Church&quot; (Ephesians 2:20). A chief or head cornerstone is placed above two walls to keep them together and prevent the building from falling apart. Many of the more ancient churches will place relics of the saints, especially martyrs, in the foundation stone.

====Western Roman Catholic Churches====
According to the pre-Vatican II rite of the Roman Catholic Church: Before the construction of a new church begins, the foundations of the building are clearly marked out and a wooden cross is set up to indicate where the altar will stand. Once preparations have been made, the bishop—or a priest delegated by him for that purpose—will bless holy water and with it sprinkle first the cross that was erected and then the foundation stone itself. Upon the stone he is directed to engrave crosses on each side with a knife, and then pronounce the following prayer: &quot;Bless, O Lord, this creature of stone (&quot;creaturam istam lapidis&quot;) and grant by the invocation of Thy holy name that all who with a pure mind shall lend aid to the building of this church may obtain soundness of body and the healing of their souls. Through Christ Our Lord, Amen.&quot;

After this, the Litany of the Saints is said, followed by an antiphon and Psalm 126 ( in the Hebrew numbering), which appropriately begins with the verse, &quot;Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it&quot;. Then the stone is lowered into its place with another prayer and again sprinkled with holy water. More antiphons and psalms follow, while the bishop sprinkles the foundations, dividing them into three sections and ending each with a special prayer. Finally, &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot; is sung, and two short prayers. Then the bishop, if he deems it opportune, sits down and exhorts the people to contribute to the construction, appointments and maintenance of the new church, after which he dismisses them with his blessing and the proclamation of an indulgence.

====Eastern Churches====
In the Eastern Orthodox Church the blessing of the bishop must be obtained before construction on a new church may commence, and any clergyman who ventures to do so without a blessing can be deposed. The &quot;Rite of the Foundation of a Church&quot; (i.e., the laying of the cornerstone) will differ slightly depending on whether the church is to be constructed of wood or of stone. Even when a church is built of wood, the cornerstone must in fact be made of stone.

The cornerstone is a solid stone cube upon which a cross has been carved. Below the cross, the following words are inscribed:

In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, this church is founded, in honour and memory of (&quot;here the name of the patron saint of the new church is inserted&quot;); in the rule of (&quot;here the name of the ruler is inserted&quot;); in the episcopacy of (&quot;here the name of the bishop is inserted&quot;); in the Year of the World _____ (Anno Mundi), and from the Birth in the flesh of God the Word _____ (Anno Domini).

In the top of the stone a cross-shaped space is hollowed out into which relics may be placed. Relics are not required, but they are normally placed in the cornerstone. If no relics are inserted in the stone, the inscription may be omitted, but not the cross.

After the foundations for the new church have been dug and all preparations finished, the bishop (or his deputy) with the other clergy vest and form a crucession to the building site. The service begins with a moleben and the blessing of holy water. Then a cross is erected in the place where the Holy Table (altar) will stand, and the cornerstone is consecrated and set in place.

<text>A block plane is a small metal-bodied woodworking hand plane which typically has the blade bedded at a lower angle than other planes, with the bevel up. It is designed to cut end grain and do touchup or finish work. It is typically small enough to be used with one hand.

== Description ==
Block planes vary in length from . The most common standard angled block planes have the blade angled at ~20°. Low angle block planes have the blade angled at ~12°.

== Origin ==
According to Patrick&#x27;s Stanley Blood and Gore, Stanley marketing materials describe the origin of the name of this tool as follows: &quot;A Block Plane was first made to meet the demand for a Plane which could be easily held in one hand while planing across the grain, particularly the ends of boards, etc. This latter work many Carpenters call &#x27;Blocking in&#x27;, hence the name &#x27;Block&#x27; Plane.&quot; Tradition also claims that the block plane gets its name from its traditional use to level and remove cleaver marks from butchers&#x27; blocks that were built with the end grain facing up.

It is a common modern error to refer to older wooden-bodied bench planes as block planes, as they were made from a block of wood. Historically, the term “block plane” was not used before it was applied to small metal-bodied planes, which were designed and produced beginning in the 1860s.

== Usage ==
A block plane is frequently used for paring end grain. This is possible because a block plane has its blade set at a shallow bed angle, allowing the blade to slice through end grain more efficiently; furthermore, for this to work, the plane is frequently held at an angle sometimes as much as 45 degrees to the direction of travel, so that the cutting edge slices the wood fibers as they pass from one end of the cutting edge to the other.

A block plane has many other uses in woodworking. Typically, it is used for cleaning up components by removing thin shavings of wood in order to make a component fit within fine tolerances. Chamfering (angling square edges) and removing glue lines are some of the other uses woodworkers find for the block plane.

<text>A smoothing plane or smooth plane is a type of bench plane used in woodworking. The smoothing plane is typically the last plane used on a wood surface, removing very fine shavings to leave a smooth finish. When used effectively it quickly produces a finish that equals or surpasses that made by sandpaper.

== Description and history ==
The smoothing plane is the shortest of the bench planes. Under the Stanley Bailey numbering system for metal-bodied planes #1 to #4 are smoothing planes, with lengths ranging from to . The #4 plane, which is in length, is the most common smoothing plane in use. Historically wooden smoothing planes in the United States have typically been long with irons wide.

As with other bench planes, until the end of the 19th century the bodies of smoothing planes were predominantly wooden, typically made out of beech (&quot;Fagus sylvatica&quot; in Europe, &quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot; in North America). Wooden planes were largely superseded by iron-bodied planes and to a lesser extent transitional planes. Despite the predominance of the heavier iron-bodied planes, vintage wooden planes remain in common use, while new wooden smoothing planes are available from a small number of manufacturers.

Being smaller than other bench planes, the smoothing plane is better able to work on smaller workpieces and around obstructions. Since the 1700s wooden smoothing planes have predominantly been &#x27;coffin shaped&#x27; – wider in the middle and slightly rounded – making them more manoeuvrable. It has also been claimed that the coffin design exposes more end grain, enabling the plane to better adjust to changes in humidity.

The irons (blades) on smoothing planes are often slightly rounded at the corners to minimise the risk of gouging out tracks or marks in the workpiece, and on a metal plane the throat or mouth is usually set tight to reduce the risk of tearout.

In Britain the name smoothing plane dates back to at least the 17th century.

== Use ==
A smoothing plane is typically used after the workpiece has been flattened and trued by the other bench planes, such as the jack, fore, and jointer planes. Smoothing planes can also be used to remove marks left by woodworking machinery.

When used effectively alongside other bench planes, the smoothing plane should only need a handful of passes removing shavings as fine as or less. The workpiece is then ready to be finished, or can be further refined with a card scraper or sandpaper.

The smoothing plane is usually held with both hands, and used in a similar manner to the other bench planes. 

Though designed for smoothing, a smoothing plane can be used as an &#x27;all-round&#x27; bench tool and for rougher work depending on how it is set up.

<text>The Alarodian languages are a proposed language family that encompasses the Northeast Caucasian (Nakh–Dagestanian) languages and the extinct Hurro-Urartian languages.

== History ==

The term Alarodian is derived from Greek &quot;Ἀλαρόδιοι&quot; (&quot;Alarodioi&quot;), the name of an ethnic group mentioned by Herodotus that has often been equated with the people of the kingdom of Urartu, although this equation is considered doubtful by modern scholars. A leading Urartologist, Paul Zimansky, rejects a connection between the Urartians and the Alarodians. Almost nothing is known about the Alarodians except that they &quot;were armed like the Colchians and Saspeires,&quot; according to Herodotus. The Colchians and Saspeires are generally associated with the Kartvelians and/or Scythians, neither of whom spoke a Hurro-Urartian or Northeast Caucasian language 

Historically, the term &quot;Alarodian languages&quot; was employed for several language family proposals of various size. Sayce (1880) employed the name for a small group that comprised Urartian (then called &quot;Vannic&quot;) and the Kartvelian languages (Georgian, Laz, Mingrelian, and Svan). In 1884, the German orientalist Fritz Hommel further included all languages of the Caucasus and the ancient Near East which did not belong to the Indo-European, Semitic, and the now obsolete Ural–Altaic language families, e.g. Elamite, Kassite. Later, he extended the Alarodian family to include the pre-Indo-European languages of Europe, e.g. Lemnian, Etruscan, Ligurian. Karel Oštir&#x27;s (1921) version of Alarodian included all aforementioned languages, further Basque, Sumerian, Egyptian, the Cushitic and Berber languages. The historical Alarodian proposal – especially Oštir&#x27;s maximal extension – was not well-received by the majority of scholars (&quot;Ce petit livre donne le vertige&quot;—&quot;This little book makes one dizzy&quot;, A. Meillet), and eventually abandoned.

The term &quot;Alarodian languages&quot; was revived by I. M. Diakonoff for the proposed language family that unites the Hurro-Urartian and Northeast Caucasian languages. Work by I. M. Diakonoff and Starostin (1986) asserted the connection between &quot;Nakh-Dagestanian&quot; (NE Caucasian) and Hurro-Urartian on the basis of a comparison of their reconstruction to Proto-Nakh-Dagestanian, later published in 1994 with Nikolayev.

===Proposed relation to Tyrsenian===
The inclusion of Etruscan and the related Tyrsenian languages has also been proposed, first by Orel and Starostin in 1990, on the basis of sound correspondences. Facchetti has argued that there is a &quot;curious&quot; set of isoglosses between Etruscan and Hurrian, while Pliev proposed instead that Etruscan had a Nakh substrate. In 2006, Robertson further developed the hypothesis of including Tyrsenian based on proposed Etruscan/Nakh sound correspondences and reconstructions for the numerals.

==Reception==
The validity of the Alarodian hypothesis remains fairly controversial. Many scholars doubt that the Hurro-Urartian and Northeast Caucasian languages are related, or believe that, while a connection is possible, the evidence is far from conclusive. The Indo-Europeanist Allan R. Bomhard argues instead for a genetic relationship between Hurro-Urartian and Indo-European (most experts exclude a close genetic relationship between Northeast Caucasian and Indo-European, making the two hypotheses probably exclusive). The Caucasian language specialist Johanna Nichols grounds her skepticism about the Alarodian theory in that &quot;neither Diakonoff and Starostin, nor Nikolayev and Starostin, take on the burden of proof and discuss whether the incidence of resemblances exceeds chance expectation, nor do they present examples of the kind of shared morphological paradigmaticity that would strongly support genetic relatedness&quot;.

Nevertheless, Petri Kallio, a Uralicist and Indo-Europeanist, argues that from the perspective of what relationships are most likely for Northeast Caucasian, the Alarodian theory is the most promising, more so than the attempts to link Northeast and Northwest Caucasian, let alone attempts to link Northeast Caucasian to Indo-European, Kartvelian, Etruscan, Burushaski, or &quot;Dene-Caucasian&quot;. A major obstacle to progress on the question (and any other questions about relationships with or within Northeast Caucasian) is the lack of consensus about the reconstruction of Proto-Northeast Caucasian itself.

<text>An anti-materiel rifle (AMR) is a rifle designed for use against military equipment, structures, and other hardware (materiel) targets. Anti-materiel rifles are chambered in significantly larger calibers than conventional rifles and are employed to eliminate equipment such as engines and unarmored or lightly armored targets. Although not originally designed for use against human targets, the bullet weight and velocity of anti-materiel rifles gives them exceptional long-range capability even when compared with designated sniper rifles. Anti-materiel rifles are made in both bolt-action as well as semi-automatic designs.

The anti-materiel rifle originated in the anti-tank rifles, which itself originated during World War I. While modern tanks and most other armored vehicles are too well protected to be affected by anti-materiel rifles, the guns are still effective for attacking unarmored or lightly armored vehicles. They can also be used against stationary enemy aircraft, missile launchers, radar equipment, unexploded ordnance, small watercraft, communications equipment, crew-served weapons and similar targets. Their value lies in their ability to precisely target and disable enemy assets from long range at relatively low cost.

== History ==

=== World War I ===

The history of anti-materiel rifles dates back to World War I. The need for anti-tank rifles was first encountered by the Germans when faced with the British Mark 1 tank. The Mark I could cross ditches up to wide, which made it a major threat to infantry in trench defenses.

As a counter, the Germans first used &quot;direct fire mortars&quot;, which were mortars aimed at low angles pointing towards enemy tanks. Later, the Germans developed the T-Gewehr anti-tank rifle, which can be credited with being the first anti-materiel rifle. The rifle was designed to penetrate the thick armor of the British tanks. The rifle weighed when loaded, fired a 13.2 mm round weighing , and had an effective range of about . This weapon had a two-man crew: one to load and the other to fire the weapon, although they often switched roles. The recoil of this weapon was so high that it was known to break collar bones and dislocate shoulders. The rifle fired a steel core armor-piercing round specifically designed to be used with this rifle.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, anti-materiel guns were widely used. In September 1939 Polish army used the successful wz. 35 anti-tank rifle, around 800 of which were captured by Germans and put into service as Panzerbüchse 35(p). The British Boys anti-tank rifle was used to great effect against lightly armored tanks, but was soon replaced by the PIAT due to its ineffectiveness against more armored tanks. The PTRD-41 and PTRS-41 anti-tank rifles were used by the Soviets on the Eastern Front. Germany used the Panzerbüchse 39, while Japan used the Type 97 automatic cannon, though the latter became obsolete by 1942. Notably, the United States did not develop or field any anti-tank rifles during the war, choosing instead to use explosive anti-tank weaponry such as the M1 Bazooka (though Swiss anti-tank rifles were trialed).

One anti-tank rifle used was the Lahti L-39, a Finnish anti-materiel rifle. One version was designed to fire a 13.2 mm cartridge and another a 20 mm cartridge. There was debate over which was more effective at piercing armor. Some argued that the smaller cartridge travelled faster and could penetrate deeper into the armor, while others believed that the higher caliber rounds would cause greater damage. The weapon was quite heavy at and had an barrel, and it carried the nickname &quot;the elephant gun&quot;.

=== Cold War ===
During the Cold War, the Barrett M82 rifle was produced by the United States, and was chambered to fire a .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) round. This weapon was sold by the U.S. to Swedish forces.

=== Gulf War ===
The M82 rifle first saw action in the early 1990s, during the Gulf War. The U.S. Marine Corps initially purchased around 125 M82 rifles; orders from the Army and Air Force followed. These weapons were used with rounds such as armor piercing incendiary rounds (API) which were effective against such targets as buildings, trucks, and parked aircraft. The purpose of this round was to penetrate non-armored vehicles and burst into flames on impact. Saboted light armor penetrator ammunition was also used in anti-materiel rifles during the conflict.

=== Modern day ===
In the modern era, the armor of tanks and other vehicles increased, making it difficult for .50 BMG bullets to penetrate. As such, modern day anti-materiel rifles are no longer used in an anti-tank capacity, and generally used to penetrate light armor vehicles or for its barrier-blind capabilities against targets behind concrete barricades and buildings; as well as being used to destroy unexploded ordnance. Additionally, modern anti-materiel rifles are frequently used as sniper rifles against personnel targets, due to their long range, relatively low cost of construction for craft-produced models, and robust penetrating capabilities. They have seen frequent use in Syria and Iraq as a counter-VBIED weapon system, due to their greater ability to penetrate uparmored VBIED threats that standard rifle calibers used by designated marksmen (typically 7.62×54mmR and 7.62×51mm) are not able to reliably stop.

== Description ==

Despite having been designed to be used against equipment, anti-materiel rifles have also been used for killing soldiers from distances that are beyond the effective range of regular rifle-caliber cartridges. Anti-materiel rifles can also penetrate most obstacles and building materials, making them viable for engaging targets behind cover that is usually hard enough to stop rifle-caliber cartridges. In general, anti-materiel rifles are chambered for 12.7×99 mm NATO (.50 BMG), 12.7×108 mm Russian, 14.5×114 mm Russian, and 20 mm cartridges. According to the US Army, the range of a standard sniper rifle firing a 7.62×51mm NATO round is a distance of about while the Barrett&#x27;s effective range is against personnel targets, and against materiel targets. The offensive use of anti-materiel rifles is termed &quot;hard target interdiction&quot; (HTI) by the United States military. The longest confirmed kill shot was made with a .50 BMG by a Canadian sniper in Iraq at .

<doc id="452975" wikidata="Q1430136" url="?curid=452975" title="Scrub plane">
<text>The scrub plane is a type of plane used to remove large amounts of wood from the surface of lumber, such as when eliminating cup or twist in the first stages of preparing rough stock, or when reducing the thickness of a board significantly. Scrub planes generally have a short sole, a relatively narrow but thick blade, a very wide mouth, and a deeply curved edge (of about a 3 inch to 7 inch radius) to make a deep, gouging cut.

A scrub plane is generally used in diagonal strokes across the face of a board, rather than parallel to the length of the board (along the grain) as with most other bench planes. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the scrub plane is usually followed by the jack plane, jointer plane, then smoothing plane.

Its function in modern woodworking has been largely replaced by power tools such as the thickness planer. A scrub plane can still be useful for planing boards too wide to fit through a thickness planer.

<doc id="452981" wikidata="Q308714" url="?curid=452981" title="Communist Party USA">
<text>The Communist Party USA, officially the Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA), is a communist party in the United States which was established in 1919 after a split in the Socialist Party of America following the Russian Revolution.

The history of the CPUSA is closely related to the history of the American labor movement and the history of communist parties worldwide. Initially operating underground due to the Palmer Raids, which started during the First Red Scare, the party was influential in American politics in the first half of the 20th century. It also played a prominent role in the history of the labor movement from the 1920s through the 1940s, playing a key role in the founding of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The party was unique among labor activist groups of the time in being outspokenly anti-racist and opposed to racial segregation after sponsoring the defense for the Scottsboro Boys in 1931. The party reached the apex of its influence in U.S. politics during the Great Depression, playing a prominent role in the political landscape as a militant grassroots network capable of effectively organizing and mobilizing workers and the unemployed in support of cornerstone New Deal programs, principally Social Security, unemployment insurance, and the Works Progress Administration.

The transformative changes of the New Deal era combined with the U.S. alliance with the Soviet Union during World War II created an atmosphere in which the CPUSA wielded considerable influence with about 70,000 vetted party members. Under the leadership of Earl Browder, the party was critically supportive of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and branded communism as &quot;20th Century Americanism&quot;. Envisioning itself as becoming engrained within the established political structure in the post-war era, the party was dissolved in 1944 to become the &#x27;Communist Political Association.&#x27; However, as Cold War hostility ensued, the party was restored but struggled to maintain its influence amidst the prevalence of McCarthyism (also known as the Second Red Scare). Its opposition to the Marshall Plan and the Truman Doctrine failed to gain traction, and its endorsed candidate Henry A. Wallace of the Progressive Party under-performed in the 1948 presidential election. The party itself imploded following the public condemnation of Stalin by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956, with membership sinking to a few thousand who were increasingly alienated from the rest of the American Left for their support of the Soviet Union.

The CPUSA received significant funding from the Soviet Union and crafted its public positions to match those of Moscow. The CPUSA also used a covert apparatus to assist the Soviets with their intelligence activities in the United States and utilized a network of front organizations to shape public opinion. The CPUSA opposed &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot; in the Soviet Union. As a result, major funding from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ended in 1991.

== Modern membership ==
In 2011, CPUSA claimed 2,000 members. In 2017 and 2018, CPUSA claimed 5,000 members. In 2019, former Party member Daniel Rosenberg claimed that &quot;nearly half&quot; of new joiners since 2000 had &quot;paid no dues&quot; and merely signed up for the mailing list. In 2023, CPUSA claimed 15,000 members. In 2024, CPUSA claimed 20,000 members.

== History ==

During the first half of the 20th century, the Communist Party was influential in various struggles. Historian Ellen Schrecker concludes that decades of recent scholarship offer &quot;a more nuanced portrayal of the party as both a Stalinist sect tied to a vicious regime and the most dynamic organization within the American Left during the 1930s and &#x27;40s.&quot; It was also the first political party in the United States to be &quot;fully&quot; racially integrated.

By August 1919, only months after its founding, the Communist Party claimed to have 50,000 to 60,000 members. Its members also included anarchists and other radical leftists. At the time, the older and more moderate Socialist Party of America, suffering from criminal prosecutions for its antiwar stance during World War I, had declined to 40,000 members. The sections of the Communist Party&#x27;s International Workers Order (IWO) organized for communism around linguistic and ethnic lines, providing mutual aid and tailoring cultural activities to an IWO membership that peaked at 200,000 at its height.

During the Great Depression, some Americans were attracted by the visible activism of Communists on behalf of a wide range of social and economic causes, including the rights of African Americans, workers, and the unemployed. The Communist Party played a significant role in the resurgence of organized labor in the 1930s. Others, alarmed by the rise of the Falangists in Spain and the Nazis in Germany, admired the Soviet Union&#x27;s early and staunch opposition to fascism. Party membership swelled from 7,500 at the start of the decade to 55,000 by its end.

Party members also rallied to the defense of the Spanish Republic during this period after a nationalist military uprising moved to overthrow it, resulting in the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, along with leftists throughout the world, raised funds for medical relief while many of its members made their way to Spain with the aid of the party to join the Lincoln Brigade, one of the International Brigades.
The Communist Party was adamantly opposed to fascism during the Popular Front period. Although membership in the party rose to about 66,000 by 1939, nearly 20,000 members left the party by 1943. While general secretary Browder at first attacked Germany for its September 1, 1939 invasion of western Poland, on September 11 the Communist Party received a communique from Moscow denouncing the Polish government. Between September 14–16, party leaders bickered about the direction to take.

On September 17, the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland and occupied the Polish territory assigned to it by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, followed by coordination with German forces in Poland. The Communist Party then turned the focus of its public activities from anti-fascism to advocating peace, opposing military preparations. The party criticized British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French leader Édouard Daladier, but it did not at first attack President Roosevelt, reasoning that this could devastate American Communism, blaming instead Roosevelt&#x27;s advisors. The party spread the slogans &quot;The Yanks Are Not Coming&quot; and &quot;Hands Off,&quot; set up a &quot;perpetual peace vigil&quot; across the street from the White House, and announced that Roosevelt was the head of the &quot;war party of the American bourgeoisie.&quot; The party was active in the isolationist America First Committee. In October and November, after the Soviets invaded Finland and forced mutual assistance pacts from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the Communist Party considered Russian security sufficient justification to support the actions. The Comintern and its leader Georgi Dimitrov demanded that Browder change the party&#x27;s support for Roosevelt. On October 23, the party began attacking Roosevelt. The party changed this policy again after Hitler broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact by attacking the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941.

In August 1940, after NKVD agent Ramón Mercader killed Trotsky with an ice axe, Browder perpetuated Moscow&#x27;s line that the killer, who had been dating one of Trotsky&#x27;s secretaries, was a disillusioned follower. 

The Communist Party&#x27;s early labor and organizing successes did not last long. As the decades progressed, the combined effects of McCarthyism (also known as the Second Red Scare) and Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1956 &quot;Secret Speech&quot; in which he denounced the previous decades of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule and the adversities of the continuing Cold War mentality, steadily weakened the party&#x27;s internal structure and confidence. Party membership in the Communist International and its close adherence to the political positions of the Soviet Union gave most Americans the impression that the party was not only a threatening, subversive domestic entity, but that it was also a foreign agent that espoused an ideology which was fundamentally alien and threatening to the American way of life. Internal and external crises swirled together, to the point when members who did not end up in prison for party activities either tended to disappear quietly from its ranks, or they tended to adopt more moderate political positions which were at odds with the party line. By 1957, membership had dwindled to less than 10,000, of whom some 1,500 were informants for the FBI. The party was also banned by the Communist Control Act of 1954, although it was never really enforced and Congress later repealed most provisions of the act, also with some declared unconstitutional via the court system.

The party attempted to recover with its opposition to the Vietnam War during the civil rights movement in the 1960s, but its continued uncritical support for an increasingly stultified and militaristic Soviet Union further alienated it from the rest of the left-wing in the United States, which saw this supportive role as outdated and even dangerous. At the same time, the party&#x27;s aging membership demographics distanced it from the New Left in the United States.

With the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev and his effort to radically alter the Soviet economic and political system from the mid-1980s, the Communist Party finally became estranged from the leadership of the Soviet Union itself. In 1989, the Soviet Communist Party cut off major funding to the Communist Party USA due to its opposition to &quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the party held its convention and attempted to resolve the issue of whether the party should reject Marxism–Leninism. The majority reasserted the party&#x27;s now purely Marxist outlook, prompting a minority faction which urged social democrats to exit the now reduced party. The party has since adopted Marxism–Leninism within its program. In 2014, the new draft of the party constitution declared: &quot;We apply the scientific outlook developed by Marx, Engels, Lenin and others in the context of our American history, culture, and traditions.&quot;
The Communist Party is based in New York City. From 1922 to 1988, it published &quot;Morgen Freiheit&quot;, a daily newspaper written in Yiddish. For decades, its West Coast newspaper was the &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; and its East Coast newspaper was &quot;The Daily World&quot;. The two newspapers merged in 1986 into the &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly World&quot;. The &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly World&quot; has since become an online only publication called &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot;. It has since ceased being an official Communist Party publication as the party does not fund its publication. The party&#x27;s former theoretical journal &quot;Political Affairs&quot; is now also published exclusively online, but the party still maintains International Publishers as its publishing house. In June 2014, the party held its 30th National Convention in Chicago. The party&#x27;s 31st National Convention in 2019 celebrated the party&#x27;s 100th year since its founding.

The party announced on April 7, 2021, that it intended to run candidates in elections again, after a hiatus of over thirty years. Steven Estrada, who ran for city council in Long Beach, was one of the first candidates to run as an open member of the CPUSA again (although Long Beach local elections are officially non-partisan). Estrada received 8.5% of the vote.
== Beliefs ==
=== Constitution program ===
According to the constitution of the party adopted at the 30th National Convention in 2014, the Communist Party operates on the principle of democratic centralism, its highest authority being the quadrennial National Convention. Article VI, Section 3 of the 2001 Constitution laid out certain positions as non-negotiable:

[S]truggle for the unity of the working class, against all forms of national oppression, national chauvinism, discrimination and segregation, against all racist ideologies and practices... against all manifestations of male supremacy and discrimination against women... against homophobia and all manifestations of discrimination against gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people.

Among the points in the party&#x27;s &quot;Immediate Program&quot; are a $15/hour minimum wage for all workers, national universal health care, and opposition to privatization of Social Security. Economic measures such as increased taxes on &quot;the rich and corporations, strong regulation of the financial industry, regulation and public ownership of utilities,&quot; and increased federal aid to cities and states are also included in the Immediate Program, as are opposition to the Iraq War and other military interventions; opposition to free trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); nuclear disarmament and a reduced military budget; various civil rights provisions; campaign finance reform including public financing of campaigns; and election law reform, including instant runoff voting.

=== Bill of rights socialism ===

The Communist Party emphasizes a vision of socialism as an extension of American democracy. Seeking to &quot;build socialism in the United States based on the revolutionary traditions and struggles&quot; of American history, the party promotes a conception of &quot;Bill of Rights Socialism&quot; that will &quot;guarantee all the freedoms we have won over centuries of struggle and also extend the Bill of Rights to include freedom from unemployment&quot; as well as freedom &quot;from poverty, from illiteracy, and from discrimination and oppression.&quot;

Reiterating the idea of property rights in socialist society as it is outlined in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels&#x27;s &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848), the Communist Party emphasizes:

Many myths have been propagated about socialism. Contrary to right-wing claims, socialism would not take away the personal private property of workers, only the private ownership of major industries, financial institutions, and other large corporations, and the excessive luxuries of the super-rich.

Rather than making all wages entirely equal, the Communist Party holds that building socialism would entail &quot;eliminating private wealth from stock speculation, from private ownership of large corporations, from the export of capital and jobs, and from the exploitation of large numbers of workers.&quot;

=== Living standards ===
Among the primary concerns of the Communist Party are the problems of unemployment, underemployment and job insecurity, which the party considers the natural result of the profit-driven incentives of the capitalist economy:

Millions of workers are unemployed, underemployed, or insecure in their jobs, even during economic upswings and periods of &#x27;recovery&#x27; from recessions. Most workers experience long years of stagnant and declining real wages, while health and education costs soar. Many workers are forced to work second and third jobs to make ends meet. Most workers now average four different occupations during their lifetime, many involuntarily moved from job to job and career to career. Often, retirement-age workers are forced to continue working just to provide health care for themselves and their families. Millions of people continuously live below the poverty level; many suffer homelessness and hunger. Public and private programs to alleviate poverty and hunger do not reach everyone, and are inadequate even for those they do reach. With capitalist globalization, jobs move from place to place as capitalists export factories and even entire industries to other countries in a relentless search for the lowest wages.

The Communist Party believes that &quot;class struggle starts with the fight for wages, hours, benefits, working conditions, job security, and jobs. But it also includes an endless variety of other forms for fighting specific battles: resisting speed-up, picketing, contract negotiations, strikes, demonstrations, lobbying for pro-labor legislation, elections, and even general strikes&quot;. The Communist Party&#x27;s national programs considers workers who struggle &quot;against the capitalist class or any part of it on any issue with the aim of improving or defending their lives&quot; part of the class struggle.

=== Imperialism and war ===
The Communist Party maintains that developments within the foreign policy of the United States—as reflected in the rise of neoconservatives and other groups associated with right-wing politics—have developed in tandem with the interests of large-scale capital such as the multinational corporations. The state thereby becomes thrust into a proxy role that is essentially inclined to help facilitate &quot;control by one section of the capitalist class over all others and over the whole of society&quot;.

Accordingly, the Communist Party holds that right-wing policymakers such as the neoconservatives, steering the state away from working-class interests on behalf of a disproportionately powerful capitalist class, have &quot;demonized foreign opponents of the U.S., covertly funded the right-wing-initiated civil war in Nicaragua, and gave weapons to the Saddam Hussein dictatorship in Iraq. They picked small countries to invade, including Panama and Grenada, testing new military equipment and strategy, and breaking down resistance at home and abroad to U.S. military invasion as a policy option&quot;.

From its ideological framework, the Communist Party understands imperialism as the pinnacle of capitalist development: the state, working on behalf of the few who wield disproportionate power, assumes the role of proffering &quot;phony rationalizations&quot; for economically driven imperial ambition as a means to promote the sectional economic interests of big business.

In opposition to what it considers the ultimate agenda of the conservative wing of American politics, the Communist Party rejects foreign policy proposals such as the Bush Doctrine, rejecting the right of the American government to attack &quot;any country it wants, to conduct war without end until it succeeds everywhere, and even to use &#x27;tactical&#x27; nuclear weapons and militarize space. Whoever does not support the U.S. policy is condemned as an opponent. Whenever international organizations, such as the United Nations, do not support U.S. government policies, they are reluctantly tolerated until the U.S. government is able to subordinate or ignore them&quot;.

Juxtaposing the support from the Republicans and the right-wing of the Democratic Party for the Bush administration-led invasion of Iraq with the many millions of Americans who opposed the invasion of Iraq from its beginning, the Communist Party notes the spirit of opposition towards the war coming from the American public:

The party has consistently opposed American involvement in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the First Gulf War and the post-September 11 conflicts in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

The Communist Party does not believe that the threat of terrorism can be resolved through war.

=== Women and minorities ===

The Communist Party Constitution defines the U.S. working class as &quot;multiracial and multinational. It unites men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native-born and immigrant, urban and rural.&quot; The party further expands its interpretation to include the employed and unemployed, organized and unorganized, and of all occupations.

The Communist Party seeks equal rights for women, equal pay for equal work and the protection of reproductive rights, together with putting an end to sexism. They support the right of abortion and social services to provide access to it, arguing that unplanned pregnancy is prejudiced against poor women. The party&#x27;s ranks include a Women&#x27;s Equality Commission, which recognizes the role of women as an asset in moving towards building socialism.

Historically significant in American history as an early fighter for African Americans&#x27; rights and playing a leading role in protesting the lynchings of African Americans in the South, the Communist Party in its national program today calls racism the &quot;classic divide-and-conquer tactic&quot;. From its New York City base, the Communist Party&#x27;s Ben Davis Club and other Communist Party organizations have been involved in local activism in Harlem and other African American and minority communities. The Communist Party was instrumental in the founding of the progressive Black Radical Congress in 1998, as well as the African Blood Brotherhood.

Historically significant in Latino working class history as a successful organizer of the Mexican American working class in the Southwestern United States in the 1930s, the Communist Party regards working-class Latino people as another oppressed group targeted by overt racism as well as systemic discrimination in areas such as education and sees the participation of Latino voters in a general mass movement in both party-based and nonpartisan work as an essential goal for major left-wing progress.

The Communist Party holds that racial and ethnic discrimination not only harms minorities, but is pernicious to working-class people of all backgrounds as any discriminatory practices between demographic sections of the working class constitute an inherently divisive practice responsible for &quot;obstructing the development of working-class consciousness, driving wedges in class unity to divert attention from class exploitation, and creating extra profits for the capitalist class&quot;.

The Communist Party supports an end to racial profiling. The party supports continued enforcement of civil rights laws as well as affirmative action.

== Geography ==

The Communist Party garnered support in particular communities, developing a unique geography. Instead of a broad nationwide support, support for the party was concentrated in different communities at different times, depending on the organizing strategy at that moment.

Before World War II, the Communist Party had relatively stable support in New York City, Chicago and St. Louis County, Minnesota. However, at times the party also had strongholds in more rural counties such as Sheridan County, Montana (22% in 1932), Iron County, Wisconsin (4% in 1932), or Ontonagon County, Michigan (5% in 1934). Even in the South at the height of Jim Crow, the Communist Party had a significant presence in Alabama. Despite the disenfranchisement of African Americans, the party gained 8% of the votes in rural Elmore County. This was mostly due to the successful biracial organizing of sharecroppers through the Sharecroppers&#x27; Union.

Unlike open mass organizations like the Socialist Party or the NAACP, the Communist Party was a disciplined organization that demanded strenuous commitments and frequently expelled members. Membership levels remained below 20,000 until 1933 and then surged upward in the late 1930s, reaching 66,000 in 1939 and reaching its peak membership of over 75,000 in 1947.

The party fielded candidates in presidential and many state and local elections not expecting to win, but expecting loyalists to vote the party ticket. The party mounted symbolic yet energetic campaigns during each presidential election from 1924 through 1940 and many gubernatorial and congressional races from 1922 to 1944.

The Communist Party organized the country into districts that did not coincide with state lines, initially dividing it into 15 districts identified with a headquarters city with an additional &quot;Agricultural District&quot;. Several reorganizations in the 1930s expanded the number of districts.

== Relations with other groups ==
=== United States labor movement ===
The Communist Party has sought to play an active role in the labor movement since its origins as part of its effort to build a mass movement of American workers to bring about their own liberation through socialist revolution.

=== Soviet funding and espionage ===
From 1959 until 1989, when Gus Hall condemned the initiatives taken by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party received a substantial subsidy from the Soviets. There is at least one receipt signed by Gus Hall in the KGB archives. Starting with $75,000 in 1959, this was increased gradually to $3 million in 1987. This substantial amount reflected the party&#x27;s loyalty to the Moscow line, in contrast to the Italian and later Spanish and British Communist parties, whose Eurocommunism deviated from the orthodox line in the late 1970s. Releases from the Soviet archives show that all national Communist parties that conformed to the Soviet line were funded in the same fashion. From the Communist point of view, this international funding arose from the internationalist nature of communism itself as fraternal assistance was considered the duty of communists in any one country to give aid to their allies in other countries. From the anti-Communist point of view, this funding represented an unwarranted interference by one country in the affairs of another. The cutoff of funds in 1989 resulted in a financial crisis, which forced the party to cut back publication in 1990 of the party newspaper, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot;, to weekly publication, the &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly World&quot; (see references below).

Somewhat more controversial than mere funding is the alleged involvement of Communist members in espionage for the Soviet Union. Whittaker Chambers alleged that Sandor Goldberger—also known as Josef Peters, who commonly wrote under the name J. Peters—headed the Communist Party&#x27;s underground secret apparatus from 1932 to 1938 and pioneered its role as an auxiliary to Soviet intelligence activities. Bernard Schuster, Organizational Secretary of the New York District of the Communist Party, is claimed to have been the operational recruiter and conduit for members of the party into the ranks of the secret apparatus, or &quot;Group A line&quot;.

Stalin publicly disbanded the Comintern in 1943. A Moscow NKVD message to all stations on September 12, 1943, detailed instructions for handling intelligence sources within the Communist Party after the disestablishment of the Comintern.

There are a number of decrypted World War II Soviet messages between NKVD offices in the United States and Moscow, also known as the Venona cables. The Venona cables and other published sources appear to confirm that Julius Rosenberg was responsible for espionage. Theodore Hall, a Harvard-trained physicist who did not join the party until 1952, began passing information on the atomic bomb to the Soviets soon after he was hired at Los Alamos at age 19. Hall, who was known as Mlad by his KGB handlers, escaped prosecution. Hall&#x27;s wife, aware of his espionage, claims that their NKVD handler had advised them to plead innocent, as the Rosenbergs did, if formally charged.

It was the belief of opponents of the Communist Party such as J. Edgar Hoover, longtime director of the FBI; and Joseph McCarthy, for whom McCarthyism is named; and other anti-Communists that the Communist Party constituted an active conspiracy, was secretive, loyal to a foreign power and whose members assisted Soviet intelligence in the clandestine infiltration of American government. This is the traditionalist view of some in the field of Communist studies such as Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes, since supported by several memoirs of ex-Soviet KGB officers and information obtained from the Venona project and Soviet archives.

At one time, this view was shared by the majority of the Congress. In the &quot;Findings and declarations of fact&quot; section of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. Chap. 23 Sub. IV Sec. 841), it stated:

[T]he Communist Party, although purportedly a political party, is in fact an instrumentality of a conspiracy to overthrow the Government of the United States. It constitutes an authoritarian dictatorship within a republic... the policies and programs of the Communist Party are secretly prescribed for it by the foreign leaders... to carry into action slavishly the assignments given... [T]he Communist Party acknowledges no constitutional or statutory limitations... The peril inherent in its operation arises [from] its dedication to the proposition that the present constitutional Government of the United States ultimately must be brought to ruin by any available means, including resort to force and violence... its role as the agency of a hostile foreign power renders its existence a clear present and continuing danger.

In 1993, experts from the Library of Congress traveled to Moscow to copy previously secret archives of the party records, sent to the Soviet Union for safekeeping by party organizers. The records provided an irrefutable link between Soviet intelligence and information obtained by the Communist Party and its contacts in the United States government from the 1920s through the 1940s. Some documents revealed that the Communist Party was actively involved in secretly recruiting party members from African American groups and rural farm workers. Other party records contained further evidence that Soviet sympathizers had indeed infiltrated the State Department, beginning in the 1930s. Included in Communist Party archival records were confidential letters from two American ambassadors in Europe to Roosevelt and a senior State Department official. Thanks to an official in the Department of State sympathetic to the party, the confidential correspondence, concerning political and economic matters in Europe, ended up in the hands of Soviet intelligence.

==== Counterintelligence ====
In 1952, Jack and Morris Childs, together codenamed SOLO, became FBI informants. As high-ranking officials in the American Communist Party, they informed on the CPUSA for the rest of the Cold War, monitoring the Soviet funding. They also traveled to Moscow and Beijing to meet USSR and PRC leadership. Jack and Morris Childs both received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1987 for their intelligence work. Morris&#x27;s son stated, &quot;The CIA could not believe the information the FBI had because the American Communist Party had links directly into the Kremlin.&quot;

According to intelligence analyst Darren E. Tromblay, the SOLO operation, and the Ad Hoc Committee, were part of &quot;developing geopolitical awareness&quot; by the FBI about factors such as the Sino-Soviet split. The Ad Hoc Committee was a group within CPUSA that circulated a pro-Maoist bulletin in the voice of a &quot;dedicated but rebellious comrade.&quot; Allegedly an operation, it caused a schism within the CPUSA.

=== Criminal prosecutions ===

When the Communist Party was formed in 1919, the United States government was engaged in prosecution of socialists who had opposed World War I and military service. This prosecution was continued in 1919 and January 1920 in the Palmer Raids as part of the First Red Scare. Rank and file foreign-born members of the Communist Party were targeted and as many as possible were arrested and deported while leaders were prosecuted and, in some cases, sentenced to prison terms. In the late 1930s, with the authorization of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the FBI began investigating both domestic Nazis and Communists. In 1940, Congress passed the Smith Act, which made it illegal to advocate, abet, or teach the desirability of overthrowing the government.

In 1949, the federal government put Eugene Dennis, William Z. Foster and ten other Communist Party leaders on trial for advocating the violent overthrow of the government. Because the prosecution could not show that any of the defendants had openly called for violence or been involved in accumulating weapons for a proposed revolution, it relied on the testimony of former members of the party that the defendants had privately advocated the overthrow of the government and on quotations from the work of Marx, Lenin and other revolutionary figures of the past. During the course of the trial, the judge held several of the defendants and all of their counsel in contempt of court. All of the remaining eleven defendants were found guilty, and the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of their convictions by a 6–2 vote in &quot;Dennis v. United States&quot;, . The government then proceeded with the prosecutions of more than 140 members of the party.

Panicked by these arrests and fearing that the party was dangerously compromised by informants, Dennis and other party leaders decided to go underground and to disband many affiliated groups. The move heightened the political isolation of the leadership while making it nearly impossible for the party to function. The widespread support of action against communists and their associates began to abate after Senator Joseph McCarthy overreached himself in the Army–McCarthy hearings, producing a backlash. The end of the Korean War in 1953 also led to a lessening of anxieties about subversion. The Supreme Court brought a halt to the Smith Act prosecutions in 1957 in its decision in &quot;Yates v. United States&quot;, , which required that the government prove that the defendant had actually taken concrete steps toward the forcible overthrow of the government, rather than merely advocating it in theory.

=== African Americans ===
The Communist Party played a role in defending the rights of African Americans during its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s. The Alabama Chapter of the Communist Party USA helped organize the unemployed Black workers, the Alabama Sharecroppers&#x27; Union and numerous anti-lynching campaigns. Further, the Alabama chapter organized young activists that would later go on to be prominent members in the civil rights movement, such as Rosa Parks. Throughout its history several of the party&#x27;s leaders and political thinkers have been African Americans. James Ford, Charlene Mitchell, Angela Davis and Jarvis Tyner, the current executive vice chair of the party, all ran as presidential or vice presidential candidates on the party ticket. Others like Benjamin J. Davis, William L. Patterson, Harry Haywood, James Jackson, Henry Winston, Claude Lightfoot, Alphaeus Hunton, Doxey Wilkerson, Claudia Jones, and John Pittman contributed in important ways to the party&#x27;s approaches to major issues from human and civil rights, peace, women&#x27;s equality, the national question, working class unity, socialist thought, cultural struggle, and more. African American thinkers, artists and writers such as Claude McKay, Richard Wright, Ann Petry, W. E. B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Lloyd Brown, Charles White, Elizabeth Catlett, Paul Robeson, Gwendolyn Brooks, and others were one-time members or supporters of the party, and the Communist Party also had a close alliance with Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.

=== Gay rights movement ===
One of the most prominent sexual radicals in the United States, Harry Hay, developed his political views as an active member of the Communist Party. Hay founded in the early 1950s the Mattachine Society, America&#x27;s second gay rights organization. However, gay rights were not seen as something the party should associate with organizationally. Many party members saw homosexuality as something done by those with fascist tendencies (following the lead of the Soviet Union in criminalizing the practice for that reason). Hay was expelled from the party as an ideological risk. In 2004, more than a decade after the fall of the Soviet Union and after Russia had legalized male homosexual relations, the editors of &quot;Political Affairs&quot; published articles detailing their self-criticism of the party&#x27;s early views of gay and lesbian rights and praised Hay&#x27;s work.

The Communist Party endorsed LGBT rights in a 2005 statement. The party affirmed the resolution with a statement a year later in honor of gay pride month in June 2006.

=== United States peace movement ===
The Communist Party opposed the United States involvement in the early stages of World War II (until June 22, 1941, the date of the German invasion of the Soviet Union), the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the invasion of Grenada, and American support for anti-Communist military dictatorships and movements in Central America. Meanwhile, some in the peace movement and the New Left rejected the Communist Party for what it saw as the party&#x27;s bureaucratic rigidity and for its close association with the Soviet Union.

The Communist Party was consistently opposed to the United States&#x27; 2003–2011 war in Iraq. United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) includes the New York branch of the Communist Party as a member group, with Communist Judith LeBlanc serving as the co-chair of UFPJ from 2007 to 2009.

<text>In-N-Out Burgers, doing business as In-N-Out Burger, is an American regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations primarily in California and to a lesser extent the Southwest from Oregon to Texas. It was founded in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948 by Harry (1913–1976) and Esther Snyder (1920–2006). The chain is headquartered in Irvine, California, and has expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California, as well as into Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, Oregon, Colorado, and Idaho, and is planning expansions into New Mexico and Tennessee. The current owner is Lynsi Snyder, the Snyders&#x27; only grandchild.

As the chain has expanded, it has opened several distribution centers in addition to its original Baldwin Park location. The new facilities, located in Lathrop, California; Phoenix, Arizona; Draper, Utah; Dallas, Texas; and Colorado Springs, Colorado will provide for potential future expansion into other parts of the country.

In-N-Out Burger has chosen not to franchise its operations or go public; one reason is the prospect of food quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth. The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys.

==History==

===First generation===
In-N-Out Burger&#x27;s first location was opened in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park, California, in 1948 by the Snyders at the southwest corner of what is now the intersection of Interstate 10 and Francisquito Avenue. The restaurant was the first drive-thru hamburger stand in California, allowing drivers to place orders via a two-way speaker system. This was a new and unique idea, since in post-World War II California, carhops were used to take orders and serve food.

In 1951, a second In-N-Out was opened in Covina, California, west of the intersection of Grand Avenue and Arrow Highway. The company remained a relatively small southern California chain until the 1970s. The Snyders managed their first restaurants closely to ensure quality was maintained. The chain had 18 restaurants when Harry Snyder died in 1976, at the age of 63.

===Second generation===
In 1976, 24-year-old Rich Snyder became the company president after his father&#x27;s death. Along with his brother Guy, Rich had begun working in his father&#x27;s In-N-Outs at an early age. Over the next 20 years, the chain experienced a period of rapid growth under Rich&#x27;s leadership, expanding to 93 restaurants. In June 1988, In-N-Out opened its 50th location, in Thousand Palms, California.

The first location outside of the Los Angeles metropolitan area opened in San Diego County in 1990, the 57th location in the chain. In 1992, In-N-Out opened its first non-Southern California restaurant, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Its first Northern California location opened the following year in Modesto. Expansion then spread to Northern California, including the San Francisco Bay Area, while additional Las Vegas-area restaurants were added. After opening store 93 In-N-Out in Fresno, California, on December 15, 1993, Rich Snyder and four other passengers died in a plane crash on approach to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California. The charter aircraft they were on had been following a Boeing 757 in for landing, became caught in its wake turbulence, and crashed. The ensuing crash investigation led to the Federal Aviation Administration requirement for an adequate distance between heavy aircraft and following light aircraft to allow wake turbulence to diminish.

Upon Rich Snyder&#x27;s death, Guy Snyder assumed the presidency in January 1994 and continued the company&#x27;s aggressive expansion until he died from an overdose of painkillers in 1999. Under his leadership, In-N-Out&#x27;s 100th location was opened in Gilroy, California on November 10, 1994. He was president for nearly six years, expanding In-N-Out from 93 to 140 locations. His mother Esther subsequently took over the presidency.

===The 21st century===
With Esther Snyder&#x27;s death in 2006 at the age of 86, the presidency passed to Mark Taylor, former vice president of operations. Taylor became the company&#x27;s fifth president and first non-family member to hold the position, although he does have ties to the family. The company&#x27;s current heiress is Lynsi Snyder, daughter of Guy and only grandchild of Esther and Harry Snyder. Snyder, who was 23 years old and known as Lynsi Martinez at her grandmother&#x27;s death, owns the company through a trust. She gained control of 50% of the company in 2012 when she turned 30, and nearly full control at 35 in May 2017.

After participating in various roles in the company, Snyder assumed the presidency in 2010, becoming the company&#x27;s sixth president. However, most major decisions are made by a seven-member executive team. Snyder does not intend to franchise nor sell and plans to pass on ownership of the company to her children.

In 2018, In-N-Out donated $25,000 to the California Republican Party. In 2021 it donated $40,000. In-N-Out COO Mark Taylor, and his wife, Traci, have donated to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaigns.

On January 24, 2024, In-N-Out announced the closure of its only store in Oakland, California, due to safety concerns related to crime, marking the first time in its 75-year history that the company has shut down a location.

=== Expansion ===
The company opened locations in Arizona in 2000 and added new restaurants in Reno, Sparks, and Carson City, Nevada, in late 2004. In-N-Out became a huge success in these new locations. In late December 2005, In-N-Out&#x27;s 200th location was opened in Temecula, California. In 2007, it opened its first restaurant in Tucson, Arizona. The store opening broke company records for the most burgers sold in one day and the most sold in one week.

In 2008, In-N-Out expanded into a fourth state by opening a location in Washington, Utah, a suburb of St. George. By late 2009, the chain expanded into northern Utah with three new locations situated in Draper, American Fork, and Orem. More locations opened in the spring of 2010 in West Valley City, West Jordan, Centerville, and Riverton. In 2013, In-N-Out opened a distribution center in Las Vegas to serve mountain area restaurants.

In May 2010, In-N-Out announced plans to open new spots into Texas, specifically within the Dallas–Fort Worth area with the first In-N-Out opening in Frisco and Allen on May 11, 2011. The chain opened its first location in Austin in December 2013. There are 18 restaurant locations in the Dallas–Fort Worth area, and four in the Austin area. These new locations in Texas required the company to build a new patty production facility and distribution center in the state, according to company vice president Carl Van Fleet. In March 2014, the company confirmed its first location in San Antonio. The fall of 2014 saw the restaurant open its 22nd Texas location in Killeen. On November 20, 2014, In-N-Out opened its first location in San Antonio followed by its first location in Waco in November 2015. In January 2017, In-N-Out announced plans to expand into Houston with multiple sites planned in the area, the first being in Stafford.

In January 2015, In-N-Out opened its 300th restaurant, which was located in Anaheim, California. At the time of the opening, the company had generated $558 million in annual sales and employed nearly 18,000 in California, Nevada, Utah, Texas and Arizona.

The company opened its first location in Oregon on September 9, 2015 (the same day as Harry Snyder&#x27;s birthday) in Medford. It is supplied from the Lathrop, California, distribution center completed in 2006. President Lynsi Snyder stated during the opening that they will continue to open new spots. A second Oregon location was under construction in Grants Pass during September 2017. On August 21, 2018, In-N-Out announced plans to open a location in the Willamette Valley in Keizer. This was the company&#x27;s northernmost location.

On November 30, 2017, the company announced plans to build a production facility and distribution center in Colorado Springs, ahead of an expansion into Colorado, which is scheduled to be completed in 2021. The first Colorado locations opened in Colorado Springs and Aurora on November 20, 2020. 

In-N-Out received approval for a new distribution center to open in Chino, California, in 2020, taking some of the load off the long-standing Baldwin Park distribution center. The center opened later that year.

On November 24, 2020, In-N-Out signaled that it was in the early stages of opening a store in Idaho. The first store in the state opened in Meridian in December 2023. In-N-Out later expressed interest in opening additional stores in Boise and Nampa, as well as a second location in Meridian. The company pursued various locations around Portland, Oregon, which were rejected or stalled due to development issues; a location in Ridgefield, Washington, the first in Washington state, was announced in 2024.

On January 10, 2023, Tennessee governor Bill Lee and In-N-Out president Lynsi Snyder announced that a new hub would be built in Franklin, Tennessee, to open by 2026, and restaurants in the Southeast, beginning in the Nashville area. It is the company&#x27;s first eastern hub and will involve a $125.5 million investment.

== Products ==
The In-N-Out menu consists of three burger varieties: hamburger, cheeseburger, and &quot;Double-Double&quot; (two hamburger patties and two slices of cheese). French fries and fountain drinks are available, as well as three flavors of milkshakes. The hamburgers come with lettuce, tomato, with or without onions (the customer is asked upon ordering, and may have them fresh or grilled), and a sauce, which is called &quot;spread&quot; (a Thousand Island dressing variant).

There are, however, additional named items not on the menu, but available at every In-N-Out. These variations reside on the chain&#x27;s &quot;secret menu&quot;, though the menu is accessible on the company&#x27;s website. These variations include 3×3 (which has three patties and three slices of cheese), 4×4 (four patties and four slices of cheese), Neapolitan shakes, grilled cheese sandwich (consists of the same ingredients as the burgers except the meat, plus two slices of melted cheese), Protein Style (wrap with lettuce; consists of the same ingredients as the burgers except buns), and Animal Style (cooked in a thin layer of mustard, adding condiments including pickles, grilled onions, and extra spread). Animal Style fries come with two slices of melted cheese, spread, and grilled onions on top. Whole or sliced chili peppers are also available by request. Both Protein and Animal Style are house specialties that the company has trademarked because of their association with the chain.

Until 2005, In-N-Out accommodated burger orders of any size by adding patties and slices of cheese at an additional cost. A particularly famous incident involving a 100×100 (100 patties, 100 slices of cheese) occurred in 2004. Once word got out of the massive sandwich, In-N-Out management disallowed anything larger than a 4×4. One can also order what is called a &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; which consists of two meat patties and two slices of cheese by itself (no bun, condiments, or vegetables).

In January 2018, In-N-Out added hot chocolate with marshmallows, the first addition to the menu in fifteen years. However, it is not the first time it has appeared on the menu; it was previously served at the restaurants in its early years during the 1950s. The cocoa powder is provided by the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company.

==Store design and layout==

The signature colors for In-N-Out are white, red, and yellow. The white is used for the buildings&#x27; exterior walls and the employees&#x27; basic uniform. Red is used for the buildings&#x27; roofs and the employees&#x27; aprons and hats. Yellow is used for the decorative band on the roof and iconic arrow in the logo. However, variations in the color scheme do occur.

The first In-N-Outs had a common design, placing the kitchen &quot;stand&quot; between two lanes of cars. The &quot;front&quot; lane is nearest the street and the &quot;back&quot; lane away from the street. This location design is known as a double drive-thru. A metal awning provides shade for several tables for customers desiring to park and eat, but there is no indoor dining. A walk-up window faces the parking area. These restaurants store food and supplies in a separate building, and it is not uncommon for a driver to be asked to wait a moment while employees carry supplies to the kitchen across the rear lane.

This design is a popular image on In-N-Out ads and artwork, which often shows classic cars such as 1965 Mustangs and 1968 Firebirds visiting the original restaurants. The original Covina restaurant, located on Arrow Highway west of Grand Avenue, was forced to close in the early 1990s due to re-engineering and development of the area. A modern design, drive-up/dining room restaurant was built a few hundred feet away. The replacement building was much larger, being nearly half the size of the previous building&#x27;s lot.


Like many chain restaurants, newer In-N-Out restaurants are based on a set of templates or &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; blueprints, which are chosen based on available space and expected traffic levels. While the external appearance of its buildings may vary to meet local zoning and architectural requirements, the interior floor plan and decor in most recently constructed In-N-Out restaurants are identical. However, some restaurants are designed to stand out, such as the restaurants at Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, San Francisco and Westwood, Los Angeles designed by architect Stephen Kanner.

Today&#x27;s typical location has an interior layout that includes a customer service counter with registers in front of a kitchen and food preparation area. There are separate storage areas for paper goods (napkins, bags, etc.) and &quot;dry&quot; food goods (potatoes, buns, etc.), as well as a walk-in refrigerator for perishable goods (lettuce, cheese, spread, etc.), and a dedicated meat refrigerator for burger patties. The customer area includes an indoor dining room with a combination of booths, tables, and bar-style seating. Outside seating is usually available as well, with tables and benches. Most newer restaurants contain a one-lane drive-through. 

There are other design elements common among today&#x27;s In-N-Out locations. Matching In-N-Out&#x27;s California-inspired palm tree theme, palm trees are sometimes planted to form an &quot;X&quot; in front of the restaurants. This is an allusion to founder Harry Snyder&#x27;s favorite movie, Stanley Kramer&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, in which the characters look for a hidden treasure and find it under &quot;the big W&quot; made by four palm trees, with the middle two forming an &quot;X&quot;.

==Advertising==
Like other fast-food chains, In-N-Out uses roadside billboards that direct customers to the nearest location. Billboard ads display an image of the trademarked Double-Double burger. The chain uses short radio commercials, often limited to the song &quot;In-N-Out, In-N-Out. That&#x27;s what a hamburger&#x27;s all about.&quot; Television commercials, which are less common, feature the hamburger&#x27;s visual appeal. In-N-Out seldom uses celebrities in ads, although John Cleese and John Goodman have voiced radio spots. In the past, the Snyders also sponsored Christmas music programming with voice-overs expressing the meaning of the holiday.

In addition to commercials, In-N-Out benefits from enthusiastic fans who talk to each other. For many years, it has given customers free bumper stickers, which simply say &quot;In-N-Out Burger&quot; but are commonly modified to say &quot;In-N-Out urge&quot;. The company helps devoted customers advertise its brand by selling souvenir clothing with the In-N-Out logo. Celebrity fans and free endorsements in mass media also promote the business. When Heisman Trophy winner and Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith raved about In-N-Out cheeseburgers during a press conference before the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, a senior executive said: &quot;It does not get much better than that for us. We&#x27;re kind of a small company, and we do not have any celebrity endorsers. But I think we just got the best one we could have.&quot; Huell Howser was allowed, in what is believed to be a first, to film with his television cameras inside a store for a California&#x27;s Gold Special. The show also included a behind-the-scenes tour of the In-N-Out Headquarters. Gift items are sold at an In-N-Out &quot;Company Store&quot; near the chain&#x27;s birthplace in Baldwin Park, California. A replica of the first store from 1948 was unveiled near the original site in 2014.

===Popularity===


The restaurant has achieved popularity which has led to celebration by some when brought to new locations, and the opening of a new restaurant often becomes an event. When one opened in Scottsdale, Arizona, there was a four-hour wait for food, and news helicopters whirled above the parking lot.

The chain&#x27;s image has also made it popular in some unusual ways. For example, In-N-Out is still considered acceptable in some areas with strong opposition to corporate food restaurants, such as McDonald&#x27;s. Commercial leaders in San Francisco&#x27;s Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf district said they opposed every other fast-food chain except In-N-Out because they wanted to maintain the flavor of family-owned, decades-old businesses in the area, with one saying locals would ordinarily &quot;be up in arms about a fast-food operation coming to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf,&quot; but &quot;this is different.&quot; California native and Colorado Rockies player Jason Giambi would often visit In-N-Out Burger when on the West Coast with his former team, the New York Yankees. He said he tried to open an In-N-Out Burger restaurant in New York but was unsuccessful.

The chain also has fans in a number of renowned chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Thomas Keller, Julia Child, Anthony Bourdain, Ina Garten, and Mario Batali. Famous London chef/restaurateur Ramsay ate In-N-Out for the first time when taping &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; in Los Angeles, and it soon became one of his favorite spots for take-out. Ramsay was quoted, saying about the experience: &quot;In-N-Out burgers were extraordinary. I was so bad, I sat in the restaurant, had my double cheeseburger then minutes later I drove back round and got the same thing again to take away.&quot; Thomas Keller, a fan of In-N-Out, celebrated with In-N-Out burgers at the anniversary party of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Keller also plans on opening his own burger restaurant inspired by his Los Angeles experience of In-N-Out. Julia Child, one of the first celebrities to champion the chain, admitted to knowing every location of the restaurant between Santa Barbara and San Francisco. Child also had the burgers delivered to her during a hospital stay. Anthony Bourdain reportedly said that In-N-Out was his favorite fast food meal, later naming the restaurant as &quot;the best restaurant in Los Angeles&quot;. Ina Garten at an interview at &quot;Today&quot; show said &quot;I have to say, I don&#x27;t eat fast food at all, with one exception. When we&#x27;re in California doing book tours, we always have to go to In-N-Out Burger. It&#x27;s so good and I know it was Julia Child&#x27;s favorite too, so it&#x27;s okay.&quot;

In-N-Out was one of the few restaurant chains mentioned positively in the book &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot;. The book commended the chain for using natural and fresh ingredients and for looking after the interests of employees regarding pay and benefits. An In-N-Out food truck catered &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s 2012 Academy Awards after party.

===Art===

Jack Schmidt was the first person commissioned to paint the original In-N-Out located in Baldwin Park, California for In-N-Out Burger Inc. His paintings were later reproduced on advertisements, shirts, and other consumer products. The 2022 shirt design was created by Palm Springs, California artist Danny Heller.

===Bible verses===

In-N-Out prints Bible citations in small print on areas of packaging (such as &quot;John 3:16&quot;, &quot;Proverbs 3:5&quot;, &quot;Proverbs 24:16&quot;, &quot;Nahum 1:7&quot;, &quot;Luke 6:35&quot; and &quot;Revelation 3:20&quot;). They are primarily found on the bottom underside of drink cups and the wrappers that hold their burgers together. This practice began in the 1980s during Rich Snyder&#x27;s presidency, a reflection of the evangelical Christian beliefs held by the Snyder family.

==Legal and policy issues==

===Rich Boyd lawsuit (2006)===
In 2006, a lawsuit exposed a possible family disagreement over the chain&#x27;s corporate leadership. Richard Boyd, one of In-N-Out&#x27;s vice presidents and co-trustee of two-thirds of the company stock, accused Lynsi Snyder (then known as Lynsi Martinez) and allied corporate executives of trying to force out Esther Snyder and attempting to fire Boyd unreasonably. Pre-empting the suit, Martinez, Snyder, and Taylor appeared in a December video message to employees, telling them not to believe everything they hear. The company then responded with a lawsuit of its own, alleging Boyd had construction work done on his personal property and charged it to the company, as well as favoring contractors with uncompetitive bids. Boyd was then suspended from his role as co-trustee and Northern Trust Bank of California took his place (as co-trustee) until a hearing set for May 10, 2006. However, in April, the judge dismissed two of In-N-Out&#x27;s claims against Boyd. A trial date of October 17, 2006, was set but never occurred, and a settlement was reached out of court. Ultimately, Boyd was permanently removed from his role as an employee and co-trustee.

===Chadder&#x27;s infringement lawsuit (2007)===
In June 2007, the company filed a lawsuit against an American Fork, Utah, restaurant named Chadder&#x27;s for trademark infringement, claiming that the &quot;look and feel&quot; of the restaurant too closely resembled that of In-N-Out, and that the restaurant violated trademarked menu items, such as &quot;Animal Style&quot;, &quot;Protein Style&quot;, &quot;Double-Double&quot;.

The company learned about this from Utah customers contacting the customer service department asking if In-N-Out opened a location in Utah under a different name or if they had any affiliation with the restaurant in any way. Several customers stated they ordered trademarked items such as Animal and Protein styles. Utah District Court Judge Ted Stewart issued a temporary restraining order against the look-alike. Chadder&#x27;s opened another location near the Salt Lake City area and one in Provo.

In 2009, In-N-Out opened a restaurant in American Fork less than a mile from the Chadder&#x27;s restaurant. Per their website, Chadder&#x27;s started selling a &quot;Stubby Double&quot; instead of &quot;Double Double&quot;.
The Chadder&#x27;s restaurants in Utah have gone out of business since In-N-Out restaurants have opened in Utah.

===Mexico===
In 2023, a knock-off of In-N-Out appeared on Instagram displaying images of its restaurant, named In-I-Nout, in Culiacan, Mexico. Besides the name, the restaurant&#x27;s logo, design, menu, and food presentation closely resembled that of the U.S. original. Threatened with legal action, the Mexican imitator changed its name to Sofi&#x27;s Burger. 

=== Australia ===
In-N-Out Burger has also been plagued by similarly named imitators in Australia that confuse consumers into thinking that the similarly-sounding Australian businesses is associated with the Californian-based chain. The company would take the imitators to court for trademark infringement and has opened one-day pop-ups in Sydney in 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2022; Brisbane in 2020; Melbourne in 2014 and 2018; and Perth in 2018 and 2022 to preserve their trademark rights. Customers may wait for several hours before the doors open but the food would run out very quickly, sometimes in less than hour after opening. Although In-N-Out may not have plans to open a permanent location outside its current operating region, the business strategy of having one-day pop-ups is to maintain a business presence in the country under Australian trademark law without opening a permanent restaurant.

In-N-Out successfully defended their trademarks and intellectual property rights in Australia in 2020 against Hashtag Burgers Pty Ltd, formerly doing business as &quot;Funk N Burgers&quot; and &quot;Down-N-Out Burger&quot;. In 2021, In-N-Out filed a lawsuit against Queensland-based Rich Asians Pty Ltd doing business as &quot;In &amp; Out Aussie Burgers&quot;.

It also appears that In-N-Out has used this practice in other countries as well, such as in Auckland in 2020; London in 2016 and in 2018; Toronto in 2014 and 2021; Singapore in 2012 and 2019; Tokyo in 2012; Shanghai in 2017; Bangkok in 2018; Hong Kong in 2015; Taipei in 2016; Vancouver in 2019; Buenos Aires in 2016; Seoul in 2019; Berlin in 2022; Dublin in 2021; Dubai in 2021; Petaling Jaya in 2018; Cape Town in 2016; Vienna in 2017.

===DoorDash lawsuit (2015)===
On November 6, 2015, In-N-Out filed a lawsuit against food delivery startup DoorDash, claiming trademark infringement. Two months later the lawsuit was settled out of court in a confidential settlement. DoorDash no longer delivers food from In-N-Out Burger.

=== Political donations (2018) ===
In 2018, In-N-Out faced calls for boycott after donating $25,000 to the California GOP ahead of the November elections, as well as $30,000 in August 2017 and another $30,000 in May 2016.

=== Opposition to COVID-19 vaccine requirements (2021) ===
In October 2021, the In-N-Out location in San Francisco was ordered closed by the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH), for failure to enforce the public health order requiring that all dine-in patrons of restaurants present proof that they are fully vaccinated for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The location had posted signage warning of the mandate, but the SFDPH received complaints that it was not actually enforced. The company&#x27;s chief legal officer Arnie Wensinger stated that the company &quot;fiercely disagree[s] with any government dictate that forces a private company to discriminate against customers who choose to patronize their business.&quot; The location was allowed to re-open for takeout service only until it demonstrates &quot;an adequate process and procedure for complying with the health order&quot;.

Later that month, after an In-N-Out location in Contra Costa County was similarly ordered closed by public health for not complying with its vaccine mandate, all In-N-Out locations in the region closed their dining rooms and began operating with takeout service only. The locations attracted anti-mandate demonstrations in support of the company.

===Opposition to use of face masks by employees (2023)===

In July 2023, the company announced that employees in Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Texas and Colorado would not be allowed to wear protective face masks at work, unless they could prove a valid medical exemption. The stated reason was to &quot;emphasize the importance of customer service and the ability to show our associates&#x27; smiles and other facial features,&quot; according to a company memo. The company&#x27;s communications department sent a statement from chief operating officer Denny Warnick to SFGATE: &quot;We believe that wearing a mask literally adds a barrier to communication — much of which is nonverbal — and promotes a more distant and disconnected environment.&quot;

==Charity==
===In-N-Out Burgers Foundation===
In-N-Out Burgers Foundation (known from March 13–April 14 1995 as The In-N-Out Foundation) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization founded on March 13, 1995, and classified as a &quot;Human Services: Fund Raising &amp; Fund Distribution&quot; organization under the NTEE system. Based in Irvine, California, the foundation &quot;supports organizations that provide residential treatment, emergency shelter, foster care, and early intervention for children in need&quot;. Its grant-making activities are restricted to eligible nonprofit groups that are located or provide services in areas where In-N-Out has a presence. Consequently, grant proposals are only accepted from applicants in a limited number of counties in Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Texas. In 2010, the most recent year for which financial reporting is publicly available (and before the opening of the company&#x27;s Texas locations), the foundation contributed $1,545,250 to 231 grantees in Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah. Grant-making is funded through donor contributions and In-N-Out-sponsored fundraisers; typical grants are between $2,000 and $20,000.

===Slave 2 Nothing===
In-N-Out Burger founded the Slave 2 Nothing Foundation in 2016 to &quot;improve the lives of individuals and families affected by substance abuse and/or human trafficking&quot;.

==Original restaurant==
The first In-N-Out restaurant that opened in 1948 was demolished when Interstate 10 (then US 60/US 70/US 99, the Ramona Freeway, now the San Bernardino Freeway) was built from downtown Los Angeles to the San Gabriel Valley. The freeway runs over the original location. A new restaurant was completed in 1954 near the original Baldwin Park, California, location. It was closed in November 2004 and demolished on April 16, 2011, despite discussions about using it as an In-N-Out museum chronicling the origins and history of the company. In-N-Out built a replacement restaurant on the other side of the freeway next to the original In-N-Out University (opened in 1984). A new In-N-Out University was built on the property. The university building houses the training department, which was moved from Irvine, California. In addition, the company restaurant was moved from In-N-Out&#x27;s Baldwin Park headquarters to the new lot, which holds the restaurant and university, less than a thousand feet away. In 2014, a replica of the first In-N-Out was built in Baldwin Park.

==Awards and honors==
In-N-Out Burger was ranked number 28 among America&#x27;s Best Employers 2019 by &quot;Forbes&quot;. According to a survey by Glassdoor in 2014, In-N-Out Burger ranked No. 8 on its annual list of the 50 best places to work in the U.S. and the U.K. The company reached No. 6 in Glassdoor&#x27;s 2024 Top 100 Ranking.

<text>The shoulder plane (also bullnose plane) is a plane tool with a blade flush with the edges of the plane, allowing trimming right up to the edge of a workpiece. Like a rebate plane, the shoulder plane&#x27;s blade extends, therefore cuts, to the full width of the tool. The shoulder plane is used to trim the shoulders and faces of tenons. It is used when it is necessary to trim right into the concave corner where two surfaces of the same piece of wood meet perpendicularly. It is also commonly used to clean up dadoes (housings) and tenons for joinery.

Unlike the rebate plane, the shoulder plane is intended to cut end grain. There are therefore differences between it and a rebate plane in the angles at which the iron (blade) is set.

* There is a more acute angle between the iron and the sole of the tool. 
* The iron is set square across the tool rather than obliquely (skewed).
* The iron is set face down. The ground and honed bevel forming the edge is uppermost.

A shoulder plane also has a much finer set mouth, which allows finer shavings to be taken.

<text>Hans Jonas (; ; 10 May 1903 – 5 February 1993) was a German-born American Jewish philosopher. From 1955 to 1976 he was the Alvin Johnson Professor of Philosophy at the New School for Social Research in New York City.

==Biography==

Jonas was born in Mönchengladbach, on 10 May 1903 to a Jewish family. He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Freiburg, the University of Berlin and the University of Heidelberg, and finally earned his Doctorate of Philosophy in 1928 from the University of Marburg with a thesis on Gnosticism entitled &quot;Der Begriff der Gnosis&quot; (&quot;The Concept of Gnosis&quot;) and directed by Martin Heidegger. During his study years his academic advisors included Edmund Husserl and Rudolf Bultmann. In Marburg he met Hannah Arendt, who was also pursuing her PhD there, and the two of them were to remain friends for the rest of their lives.

When Heidegger joined the Nazi Party in 1933, it may have disturbed Jonas, as he was Jewish and an active Zionist. In 1964 Jonas repudiated his mentor Heidegger for his affiliation with the Nazis.

He left Germany for England in 1933, and from England he moved to Palestine in 1934. There he met Lore Weiner, to whom he became betrothed. In 1940 he returned to Europe to join the British Army which had been arranging a special brigade for German Jews wanting to fight against Hitler. He was sent to Italy, and in the last phase of the war moved into Germany. Thus, he kept his promise that he would return only as a soldier in the victorious army. In this time he wrote several letters to Lore about philosophy, in particular philosophy of biology, that would form the basis of his later publications on the subject. They finally married in 1943.

Immediately after the war he returned to Mönchengladbach to search for his mother but found that she had been sent to the gas chambers in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Having heard this, he refused to live in Germany again. He returned to Palestine and took part in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Jonas taught briefly at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem before moving to North America. In 1950 he left for Canada, teaching at Carleton University. From there he moved in 1955 to New York City, where he was to live for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Hastings Center and Professor of Philosophy at New School for Social Research from 1955 to 1976 (where he was Alvin Johnson Professor). From 1982 to 1983 Jonas held the Eric Voegelin Visiting Professorship at the University of Munich. He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, on 5 February 1993, aged 89.

==Philosophical work==

Jonas&#x27;s writings were very influential in different spheres. For example, &quot;The Gnostic Religion&quot;, based on his early research on the Gnosis and first published in 1958, was for many years the standard work in English on the subject of Gnosticism. &quot;The Imperative of Responsibility&quot; (German 1979, English 1984) centers on social and ethical problems created by technology. Jonas insists that human survival depends on our efforts to care for our planet and its future. He formulated a new and distinctive supreme moral imperative: &quot;Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life&quot;.

While &quot;The Imperative of Responsibility&quot; has been credited with catalyzing the environmental movement in Germany, his work &quot;The Phenomenon of Life&quot; (1966) forms the philosophical undergirding of one major school of bioethics in America. Murray Bookchin and Leon Kass both referred to Hans Jonas&#x27;s work as major, or primary, inspiration. Heavily influenced by Martin Heidegger but also one of Heidegger&#x27;s most outspoken philosophical critics, &quot;The Phenomenon of Life&quot; attempts to synthesize the philosophy of matter with the philosophy of mind, producing a rich existential understanding of biology, which ultimately argues for a simultaneously material and moral human nature. On the question of abortion, Jonas was against it, saying, &quot;a mother-to-be is more than her individual self. She carries a human trust, and we should not make abortion merely a matter of her own private wish&quot;, society had a &quot;social responsibility&quot; to pregnant mothers, and &quot;To give this mission[motherhood] over completely to individual choice oversteps the order of nature.&quot;

His writing on the history of Gnosticism revisits terrain covered by earlier standard works on the subject such as Ernesto Buonaiuti&#x27;s &quot;Lo gnosticismo: storia di antiche lotte religiose&quot; (1907), interpreting the religion from a unique version of existentialist philosophical viewpoint that also informed his later contributions. He was one of the first philosophers to concern himself with ethical questions in biological science. Jonas&#x27;s career is generally divided into three periods defined by his three primary works, but in reverse order: studies of gnosticism, studies of philosophical biology, and ethical studies.

<text>The jointer plane, also known as the try plane or trying plane, is a type of hand plane used in woodworking to straighten the edges of boards in the process known as jointing, and to flatten the faces of larger boards. Its long length is designed to &#x27;ride over&#x27; the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flatter surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the jointer plane is usually preceded by the fore plane or jack plane and followed by the smoothing plane.

Jointer planes are typically long, and are the longest hand planes commonly used. Under the Stanley Bailey numbering system, #7 and #8 planes are jointer planes.

The use of the name &quot;jointer&quot; plane dates back to at least the 17th century, referring to the process of readying the edges of boards for jointing. The terms &quot;try&quot; plane, &quot;trying&quot; plane, and &quot;trueing&quot; plane have been in use since at least the 19th century.

As with other hand planes, jointer planes were originally made with wooden bodies. But, since the development of the metal-bodied hand plane at the end of the 19th century, wooden-bodied jointers have been largely superseded. Metal-bodied planes are heavier, which is particularly noticeable for planes as large as jointers. This can make metal-bodied jointers more tiring to use for extended periods of time.

<text>A hand plane is a tool for shaping wood using muscle power to force the cutting blade over the wood surface. Some rotary power planers are motorized power tools used for the same types of larger tasks, but are unsuitable for fine-scale planing, where a miniature hand plane is used.

Generally, all planes are used to flatten, reduce the thickness of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber or timber. Planing is also used to produce horizontal, vertical, or inclined flat surfaces on workpieces usually too large for shaping, where the integrity of the whole requires the same smooth surface. Special types of planes are designed to cut joints or decorative mouldings.

Hand planes are generally the combination of a cutting edge, such as a sharpened metal plate, attached to a firm body, that when moved over a wood surface, take up relatively uniform shavings, by nature of the body riding on the &#x27;high spots&#x27; in the wood, and also by providing a relatively constant angle to the cutting edge, render the planed surface very smooth. A cutter that extends below the bottom surface, or sole, of the plane slices off shavings of wood. A large, flat sole on a plane guides the cutter to remove only the highest parts of an imperfect surface, until, after several passes, the surface is flat and smooth. When used for flattening, bench planes with longer soles are preferred for boards with longer longitudinal dimensions. A longer sole registers against a greater portion of the board&#x27;s face or edge surface which leads to a more consistently flat surface or straighter edge. Conversely, using a smaller plane allows for more localized low or high spots to remain.

Though most planes are pushed across a piece of wood, holding it with one or both hands, Japanese planes are pulled toward the body, not pushed away.

Woodworking machinery that perform a similar function as hand planes include the jointer and the thickness planer, also called a thicknesser; the job these specialty power tools can still be done by hand planers and skilled manual labor as it was for many centuries. When rough lumber is reduced to dimensional lumber, a large electric motor or internal combustion engine will drive a thickness planer that removes a certain percentage of excess wood to create a uniform, smooth surface on all four sides of the board and in specialty woods, may also plane the cut edges.

== History ==

Hand planes are ancient, originating thousands of years ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across the center of the body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user&#x27;s hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii, although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a wooden core top, bottom, front and rear, and an iron blade secured with a wedge. One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a wooden core. A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear, but furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.

In the mid-1860s, Leonard Bailey began producing a line of cast iron-bodied hand planes, the patents for which were later purchased by Stanley Rule &amp; Level, now Stanley Black &amp; Decker. The original Bailey designs were further evolved and added to by Justus Traut and others at Stanley Rule &amp; Level. The Bailey and Bedrock designs became the basis for most modern metal hand plane designs manufactured today. The Bailey design is still manufactured by Stanley Black &amp; Decker.

In 1918 an air-powered handheld planing tool was developed to reduce shipbuilding labor during World War I. The air-driven cutter spun at 8,000–15,000 rpm and allowed one man to do the planing work of up to fifteen men who used manual tools.

Modern hand planes are made from wood, ductile iron or bronze which produces a tool that is heavier and will not rust.

== Parts ==

The standard components of a modern, Western-style hand plane include:
== Types ==
Most planes fall within the categories (by size) of block plane, smoothing plane, and jointing plane. Specialty planes include the shoulder plane, router plane, bullnose plane, and chisel plane, among others.

Electrically powered hand planers (loosely referred to as power planes) have joined the hand-held plane family.

Bench planes are characterized by having their cutting bevel facing down and attached to a chipbreaker. Most metal bench planes, as well as some larger wooden ones, are designed with a rear handle known as a tote. Block planes are characterized by the absence of a chipbreaker and the cutting iron bedded with the bevel up. The block plane is a smaller tool that can be held with one hand and that excels at working across the grain on a cut end of a board (end grain). It is also good for general purpose work such as taking down a knot in the wood, smoothing small pieces, and chamfering edges.

Different types of bench planes are designed to perform different tasks, the name and size of the plane being defined according to its use. Bailey iron bench planes were designated by number with respect to the length of the plane. This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. A typical smoothing plane (approx. nine inches) is usually a No. 4, jack planes at about fourteen inches are No. 5, an eighteen-inch fore plane will be a No. 6, and the jointer planes at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8, respectively. A designation, such as No. 4 indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation such as 5 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation such as 5 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3). &quot;Bedrock&quot; versions of the above are simply 600 added to the base number (although no &quot;601&quot; was ever produced, such a plane is indeed available from specialist dealers; 602 through 608, including all the fractionals, were made).

=== Order of use ===

A typical order of use in flattening, truing, and smoothing a rough sawn board might be:
* A scrub plane, which removes large amounts of wood quickly, is typically around long, but narrower than a smoothing plane, has an iron with a convex cutting edge and has a wider mouth opening to accommodate the ejection of thicker shavings/chips.
* A jack plane is up to long, continues the job of roughing out, but with more accuracy and flattening capability than the scrub.
* A jointer plane (including the smaller fore plane) is between long, and is used for jointing and final flattening out of boards.
* A smoothing plane, up to long, is used to begin preparing the surface for finishing.
* A polishing plane (&quot;kanna&quot;) is a traditional Japanese plane designed to take a smaller shaving than a Western smoothing plane to create an extremely smooth surface. Polishing planes are the same length as western smoothing planes, and unlike Western planes, which are pushed across a board, is pulled with both hands towards the user.

=== Material ===
Planes may also be classified by the material of which they are constructed:
* A wooden plane is entirely wood except for the blade. The iron is held into the plane with a wooden wedge and is adjusted by striking the plane with a hammer.
* A transitional plane has a wooden body with a metal casting set in it to hold and adjust the blade.
* A metal plane is largely constructed of metal, except, perhaps, for the handles.
* An infill plane has a body of metal filled with very dense and hardwood on which the blade rests and the handles are formed. They are typically of English or Scottish manufacture. They are prized for their ability to smooth difficult grained woods when set very finely.
* A side-escapement plane has a tall, narrow, wooden body with an iron held in place by a wedge. They are characterized by the method of shaving ejection. Instead of being expelled from the center of the plane and exiting from the top, these planes have a slit in the side by which the shaving is ejected. On some variations, the slit is accompanied by a circular bevel cut in the side of the plane.

=== Special purposes ===

Some special types of planes include:
* The rabbet plane, also known as a rebate or openside plane, which cuts rabbets (rebates) i.e. shoulders, or steps.
* The shoulder plane, is characterized by a cutter that is flush with the edges of the plane, allowing trimming right up to the edge of a workpiece. It is commonly used to clean up dadoes (housings) and tenons for joinery.
* The fillister plane, similar to a rabbet plane, with a fence that registers on the board&#x27;s edge to cut rabbets with an accurate width.
* The moulding plane, which is used to cut mouldings along the edge of a board.
* The grooving plane which is used to cut grooves along the edge of a board for joining. Grooves are the same as dadoes/housings but are being distinguished by running with the grain.
* The plow/plough plane, which cuts grooves and dadoes (housings) not in direct contact with the edge of the board.
* The router plane, which cleans up the bottom of recesses such as shallow mortises, grooves, and dadoes (housings). Router planes come in several sizes and can also be pressed into service to thickness the cheeks of tenons so that they are parallel to the face of the board.
* The chisel plane, similar to a bullnose plane, but with an exposed blade which allows it to remove wood up to a perpendicular surface such as from the bottom inside of a box.
* The finger plane, which is used for smoothing very small pieces such as toy parts, very thin strips of wood, etc. The very small curved bottom varieties are known as violin makers planes and are used in making stringed instruments.
* The bullnose plane has a very short leading edge, or &quot;toe&quot;, to its body, and so can be used in tight spaces; most commonly of the shoulder and rabbet variety. Some bullnose planes have a removable toe so that they can pull double duty as a chisel plane.
* The combination plane, which combines the function of moulding and rabbet planes, which has different cutters and adjustments.
* The circular or , which utilizes an adjustment system to control the flex on a steel sheet sole and create a uniform curve. A concave setting permits great control for planing large curves, like table sides or chair arms, and the convex works well for chair arms, legs and backs, and other applications. The compass plane, which has a flexible sole with an adjustable curve and is used to plane concave and convex surfaces. Typically used in wooden boat building.
* The toothed plane, which is used for smoothing wood with irregular grain. and for preparing stock for traditional hammer veneering applications.
* The spill plane which creates long, spiraling wood shavings or tapers.
* The spar plane, which is used for smoothing round shapes, like boat masts and chair legs.
* The match plane, which is used for making tongue and groove boards.
* Hollows and rounds are similar to moulding planes, but lack a specific moulding profile. Instead, they cut either a simple concave or convex shape on the face or edge of a board to create a single element of a complex-profile moulding. They are used in pairs or sets of various sizes to create moulding profile elements such as fillets, coves, bullnoses, thumbnails ovolos, ogees, etc. When making mouldings, hollows and rounds must be used together to create the several shapes of the profile. However, they may be used as a single plane to create a simple decorative cove or round-over on the edge of a board. Many of these hollows and rounds can be classified in the category of side-escapement planes.

== Use ==
Planing wood along its side grain should result in thin shavings rising above the surface of the wood as the edge of the plane iron is pushed forward, leaving a smooth surface, but sometimes splintering occurs. This is largely a matter of cutting &quot;with the grain&quot; or &quot;against the grain&quot; respectively, referring to the side grain of the piece of wood being worked.

The grain direction can be determined by looking at the edge or side of the work piece. Wood fibers can be seen running out to the surface that is being planed. When the fibers meet the work surface it looks like the point of an arrow that indicates the direction. With some very figured and difficult woods, the grain runs in many directions and therefore working against the grain is inevitable. In this case, a very sharp and finely-set blade is required.

When planing &quot;against the grain&quot;, the wood fibers are lifted by the plane iron, resulting in a jagged finish, called tearout.

Planing across the grain is sometimes called traverse or transverse planing.

Planing the end grain of the board involves different techniques and frequently different planes designed for working end grain. Block planes and other bevel-up planes are often effective in planing the difficult nature of end grain. These planes are usually designed to use an iron bedded at a low angle, typically about 12 degrees.

<doc id="452992" wikidata="Q1417378" url="?curid=452992" title="Torx">
<text>Torx (pronounced ) is a trademark for a type of screw drive characterized by a 6-point star-shaped pattern, developed in 1967 by Camcar Textron. A popular generic name for the drive is &quot;star&quot;, as in star screwdriver or star bits. The official generic name, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO 10664, is hexalobular internal. This is sometimes abbreviated in databases and catalogs as 6lobe (starting with the numeral &quot;6&quot;, not the capital letter &quot;G&quot;). Torx Plus, Torx Paralobe and Torx ttap are improved head profiles.

Torx screws are commonly found on automobiles, motorcycles, bicycle brake systems (disc brakes), hard disk drives, computer systems and consumer electronics. Initially, they were sometimes used in applications requiring tamper resistance, since the drive systems and screwdrivers were not widely available. However, as torx drivers became more common, tamper-resistant variants, as described below, were developed. Torx screws are also becoming increasingly popular in construction industries.

==Principles of operation==
By design, Torx head screws resist cam out better than Phillips head or slot head screws. Whereas the tendency of Phillips drivers to cam out under excessive torque has been listed as a feature preventing damage to the screw-head or driver, Torx heads were designed to &quot;prevent&quot; cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the screw head when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, screw head, or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.

The Torx design allows for a higher torque to be exerted than a similarly sized conventional hex socket head without damaging the head or the tool. The diagram depicts the interaction between the male and female components of a conventional hex drive and a Torx drive. The clearance between the components is exaggerated for clarity.

The green circle, passing through the six points of contact between the two components, represents the direction of the rotational force being exerted at each of those points. Because the plane of contact is not perpendicular to this circle, a radial force is also generated which tends to &quot;burst&quot; the female component and &quot;crush&quot; the male one. If this radial force component is too great for the material to withstand, it will cause the corners to be rounded off one or both components or will split the sides of the female part. The magnitude of this force is proportional to the cotangent of the angle (depicted in orange) between the green circle and the contact plane.

For the Torx type of design, the angle is much closer to 90° than in the case of the hex head, and so for a given torque the potentially damaging radial force is much lower. This property allows the head of the fastener to be smaller for the same required torque, which can be an advantage in applications where space to accommodate the head is limited.

==Sizing==
Torx head sizes are described using the capital letter &quot;T&quot; followed by a number ranging from T1 to T100. Some manufacturers and resellers head sizes are also described using &quot;TX&quot; or &quot;Tx&quot; in front of the number. A smaller number corresponds to a smaller point-to-point dimension of the screw head (diameter of circle circumscribed on the cross-section of the tip of the screw driver). Common sizes include T10, T15, and T25, while T35 and T47 tend to see specialized use. Only the proper driver can drive a specific head size without risk of damaging the driver or screw. The same series of Torx drivers is used to drive SAE, metric and other thread system fasteners, reducing the number of bit sizes required.

The &quot;external&quot; variants of Torx head sizes (see below) are described using the capital letter &quot;E&quot; followed by a number ranging from E4 to E44. The &quot;E&quot; numbers are different from the &quot;T&quot; numbers of the same size: for example, an E4 Torx socket fits a T20 head.

==Variants==
Although the brand &quot;Torx&quot; generally refers to the standard 6-star-driver or -socket, there are many variations to the original design, including a number made or licensed by Torx. Other tool manufacturers have been producing 8-, 10- and 12-point star drivers and sockets for many decades. The Torx brand is often used universally to describe these and other star driver variations.

=== Security Torx ===
A version known as Security Torx, Tamper-Resistant Torx (often shortened to Torx TR) or pin-in Torx contains a post in the center of the head that prevents a standard Torx driver from being inserted. However, the pin allows a smaller flat head screw driver to be used successfully between two adjacent lobes.

Security Torx has its own set of variations, and many other variations of Torx drives are available in Security or TR versions. These include five- and seven-lobed TR heads.

=== Torx Paralobe ===
Torx Paralobe is a further developed Torx Drive System with 6% longer flanks which results in a 20% higher applicable torque.

=== Torx Plus ===
A Torx successor, Torx Plus, was introduced around 1990 when the original Torx patent was expiring. The Torx Plus patent subsequently expired in 2011. The lobes are more square to allow for higher torque and to minimize wear. The name is shortened to IP (Internal Plus) with sizes ranging from 1IP to 100IP (sometimes listed as IP1 to IP100 ) and EP (External Plus) with sizes ranging from 1EP to 42EP as well as smaller sizes ranging from H7EP to H2EP and includes five-lobed tamper-resistant variants. The specifications for these licenses are held by Textron. Standard Torx drivers can be used to drive Torx Plus screws, but not to full torque because of the loose fit. Torx Plus drivers will not fit into standard Torx screws.
* A tamper-resistant version of Torx Plus exists having five lobes rather than six, plus a solid post in the center, and is used for security as the drivers are uncommon. Though Acument (formerly Textron) lists no designation, TS or IPR may be seen. The screw may alternatively be a Pentalobe.
* Torx Plus Maxx Stems is a highly specialized variant used on the ends of fasteners opposite the bolt-head, and provides higher torque than other drive systems allow. Torxstem is a stud with the Torx Plus Maxx drive on both ends.

=== Torx ttap ===
A proprietary version of Torx called Torx ttap was developed in 2006 and is licensed by Acument Intellectual Properties. It features a second recess to create a &quot;stick-fit&quot; engagement (branded Frixion Fit), designed to minimize wobbling (branded Stable Drive) without pressing and the need for magnetic bits, a feature that can be important to certain industrial users. Standard Torx drivers can be used to drive Torx ttap screws, but Torx ttap drivers will not fit standard Torx screws.

=== AudiTorx ===
AudiTorx is a tamper-proof fastener where a convex and smooth fastener head is topped with a break-away Torx drive that snaps off when the engineered torque is reached, leaving a rivet-like bolt head that cannot be easily removed. The main application for these fasteners is in the railroad industry.

=== External (inverted) Torx ===
An External Torx version exists, also known as Inverted Torx, where the screw head has the shape of a Torx screwdriver bit, and a Torx socket is used to drive it. The external &quot;E&quot; Torx nominal sizing does not correlate to the &quot;T&quot; size, (e.g. an E40 socket is too large to fit a T40 Torx bit, while an E8 Torx socket will fit a T40 Torx bit).

== Competitive variants ==
AW drive is a hexalobular-type screw head similar to Torx, with a tapered profile to aid in centering, developed by the Würth Group in Germany. It is available in five sizes: AW 10, AW 20, AW 25, AW 30 and AW 40.

T-Star plus has a similar screw drive design to Torx ttap and was introduced in 2005 by German fastener manufacturer Altenloh, Brinck &amp; Co under its brand name &quot;Spax&quot;.

<text>State Route 55 (SR 55) is an 18-mile (30-km) long north–south state highway that passes through suburban Orange County in the U.S. state of California. The portion of the route built to freeway standards is known as the Costa Mesa Freeway (formerly the Newport Freeway). SR 55 runs between Via Lido south of Pacific Coast Highway (SR 1) in Newport Beach and the Riverside Freeway (SR 91) in Anaheim to the north, intersecting other major Orange County freeways such as SR 22, SR 73, and Interstate 405 (I-405).

SR 55 was first added to the state highway system in 1931, known as part of Legislative Route 43, and was routed on surface streets. It was renumbered SR 55 in 1959, and the construction of the freeway portion began in the 1960s and continued until 1992. Due to congestion, several alternatives are being discussed to expand the freeway portion past its current end in Newport Beach. SR 55 received the first carpool lane in Orange County in 1985, and the first direct carpool ramp in 1995.

==Route description==
Starting at Via Lido on Newport Boulevard in Newport Beach, south of SR 1, SR 55 (Newport Boulevard) is a four-lane expressway for approximately to its intersection with 17th Street in Costa Mesa. It then follows a traditional street routing through a retail and commercial section of Costa Mesa until its intersection with 19th Street. The segment on Newport Boulevard includes a limited-access interchange at SR 1. Following the 19th Street intersection, SR 55 becomes an eight-lane below-grade freeway that bisects the northbound and southbound lanes of Newport Boulevard until the Mesa Drive undercrossing.

North of Fair Drive, SR 55 is an at-grade or above-grade freeway, with the exception of a stretch between the 1st Street/4th Street exit and the 17th Street exit in Santa Ana, which is below-grade. SR 55 intersects SR 73 and I-405 next to John Wayne Airport. The freeway continues north into Santa Ana and Tustin, where there is an interchange with I-5. Southbound SR 55 does not have a direct link to northbound I-5.

SR 55 continues north into Orange, where it meets the eastern terminus of SR 22. Following this, the freeway continues almost due north until reaching its northern terminus at SR 91 near the Santa Ana River. After the last exit, Lincoln Avenue and Nohl Ranch Road, there is an entrance to the 91 Express Lanes from the HOV lane.

Today, SR 55 is a heavily travelled corridor linking southern Orange County with SR 91, the main corridor between the Inland Empire and the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, as well as I-5, the main north–south corridor for California. A HOV lane has been built along the entire freeway portion from I-405 to SR 91, with some direct access ramps, including one for I-5. However, congestion is still very prevalent throughout the day, as is the norm with many Orange County freeways; Route 55 experiences a peak daily traffic volume of 262,000 vehicles and 17,292 trucks.

SR 55 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 55 from SR 91 to Costa Mesa is known as the Costa Mesa Freeway, as named by Assembly Concurrent Resolution 177, Chapter 86 in 1976.

==History==

SR 55 was built in 1931 and originally numbered Route 43. It was built from the southern terminus of SR 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway, or &quot;PCH&quot;) and continued northbound on roughly the same route it follows today, following Newport Road (today Newport Boulevard) northeast to Tustin, and then Tustin Avenue north to near its current terminus at SR 91. From here, Route 43 continued east on what is now SR 91 towards Riverside. In 1959, the highway was renumbered as Route 55, and its route was shortened from Route 1 to the also-renumbered Route 91. The freeway portion from Chapman Avenue to SR 91 opened on January 18, 1962, at a cost of $4.6 million (equivalent to $ in ). The segment between SR 73 and Chapman Avenue opened in 1966.

SR 55 was the first freeway in Orange County to receive carpool lanes, opened in October 1985 between I-405 and SR 91. The stretch of SR 55 between Mesa Drive and 19th Street in Costa Mesa was opened in 1992; plans to extend SR 55 freeway south from 19th Street to State Route 1 were never realized due to community opposition, fueling an amendment to the city charter to prevent this extension.

In 1995, the direct carpool lane ramps between I-5 and SR 55 were completed; these were the first in Orange County. The year also saw further widening of SR 55 between SR 22 and McFadden Avenue. Between 1996 and 2002, the fifth lane in both directions was constructed between I-5 and SR 91, funded with a sales tax of half a cent approved by Measure M. In April 2007, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps. The segment of SR 55 from Finley Street to the Newport Channel bridge was legally authorized to be turned over to the city of Newport Beach in 2009.

In the mid 2000s, Caltrans began adding the city of Anaheim as a control city on State Route 55 North. Signs that mention State Route 55 North would have the newer reflective posting pasted over the button sign or would be replaced with a new one that says &quot;Anaheim/Riverside&quot; to reflect this change.

SR 55 was formerly called the Newport Freeway. In 2010, the stretch between Chapman and Katella Avenues in the City of Orange was renamed the Paul Johnson Freeway for longtime local radio and television traffic reporter Paul Johnson, who died the same year.

On May 21, 2021, a road rage incident occurred in which the perpetrator fatally shot 6-year-old Aiden Leos, a passenger in his mother&#x27;s car as it was traveling on the 55 Freeway. On June 6, Marcus Anthony Eriz and Wynne Lee were arrested in connection with the death. Both suspects pleaded not guilty in court on June 18.

<text>State Route 22 (SR 22) is an east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California that connects Long Beach with northern Orange County. It runs between Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) in Long Beach and the Costa Mesa Freeway (State Route 55) in Orange by way of Garden Grove. The westernmost part of SR 22 runs along Long Beach&#x27;s 7th Street. From West Garden Grove to its eastern terminus in Orange, it is known as the Garden Grove Freeway. It is one of the two principal east–west routes in Orange County (the other being SR 91 approximately to the north).

==Route description==
SR 22 begins at the intersection of 7th Street and Pacific Coast Highway (State Route 1) in Long Beach. Then, 7th Street widens from an expressway into a freeway just before crossing the San Gabriel River (and with it, the Los Angeles/Orange County line). It then merges with the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 405) at the Interstate 605 interchange and runs concurrently with it for approximately three miles before the two routes diverge in northeastern Seal Beach. Thereafter, the Garden Grove Freeway travels mostly within the city of Garden Grove or along its border with neighboring Westminster. Just inside the Orange city limits, the freeway enters the infamously congested Orange Crush interchange with the Santa Ana and Orange Freeways (Interstate 5 and State Route 57, respectively). It continues along the border of Orange and Santa Ana for until terminating at the Costa Mesa Freeway (State Route 55).

SR 22 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 22 from I-405 to SR 55 is known as the Garden Grove Freeway, as named by the State Highway Commission on October 22, 1957. An stretch of Route 22 is named the Garden Grove Police Officers Memorial Highway to honor police officers killed in the line of duty.

==History==

SR 22 was originally designated in 1934, when the state highway system was first numbered. Before the freeway was built, it was routed along Garden Grove Boulevard (formerly Ocean Avenue).

Opened in 1967, the Garden Grove Freeway had the distinction of being one of the few freeways in Southern California to have never been widened from its original alignment, eventually resulting in severe rush hour congestion, particularly as Santa Ana&#x27;s population surged to over 300,000 during the 1990s.

In late 2004, in response to California&#x27;s budgetary deficit, OCTA began a widening project to add one mixed-flow and one high occupancy vehicle lane to the route in each direction, as well as reconfiguring and upgrading on and off ramps to contemporary standards at several interchanges, all funded by Measure M, the half-cent tax approved by Orange County voters in 1990 and later renewed in 2006. This $700 million Design-Build projected completed in a record 2 year time frame in 2007 was led by consortium composed of Granite Construction and URS Corp. as the lead designer along with several sub-consultants. A second phase to add HOV lane interchanges at the I-605 junction and at the split with I-405 was completed in 2014.

<text>Oscar Tschirky (1866 – November 6, 1950) was a Swiss-American restaurateur who was maître d&#x27;hôtel of Delmonico&#x27;s Restaurant and subsequently the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, New York, United States. He was widely known as &quot;Oscar of the Waldorf&quot; and published a large cookbook.

==Early life and education==
Oscar Tschirky was born in 1866 in Le Locle, Switzerland. He left for the United States in 1883, settling in New York City.

==Career==
Working first as a busboy, or commis waiter, in the Hoffman House shortly after his arrival in New York, he participated in the rise of exclusive restaurants. He became known as maître d&#x27;hôtel of Delmonico&#x27;s Restaurant and subsequently the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan, New York. He was widely known as &quot;Oscar of the Waldorf&quot;.

Because of his association with the restaurant, he capitalized on his association with food, although he had never worked as a chef. He published a large cookbook. He is also pictured on a relish bottle displayed in the lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria, along with other photos of him at the major events during his tenure as maître d&#x27;hôtel. He is credited with having created Waldorf salad, and for aiding in the popularization of Thousand Island dressing. Tschirky is also credited with developing the preparation of Eggs Benedict, although differing accounts make this hard to confirm.

Tschirky had a farm in New Paltz, New York, where he hosted picnics for friends and family as well as other chefs. In later years the property was purchased by the Philantropique Society and was operated as a retirement home for chefs. It later opened to the general public and was known as The Culinarians&#x27; Home.

Cornell University holds the Oscar Tschirky papers and his noted collection of menus (Cornell University School of Hotel Administration). Karl Schriftgiesser&#x27;s biography of Tshirky, &quot;Oscar of the Waldorf&quot; (1943), rather, reads much like an autobiography. Most of Oscar Tschirky&#x27;s recollections therein are devoted to the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and its founder, George C. Boldt, and his wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt.

<text>Elanus is a genus of bird of prey in the elanine kite subfamily. It was introduced by the French zoologist Jules-César Savigny in 1809 with the black-winged kite (&quot;Elanus caeruleus&quot;) as the type species. The name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; for a &quot;kite&quot;.

These are white and grey raptors of open country, with black wing markings and a short square tail. They hunt by slowly quartering over mainly savanna habitat for rodents and other small mammals, birds and insects, sometimes hovering like a kestrel. The primaries and secondaries have soft barbules from the upper surface that help in owl-like silent flight. The genus &quot;Elanus&quot; is distinctive in having very small scales covering the foot and on the underside, scutellate scales are found only under the terminal phalanges. The claw lacks a groove on the underside. They also have eyesight suited for crepuscular rodent hunting. The genus contains four species, all of which hunt small mammals, especially rodents, by hovering in the air while looking for them in over open savanna habitats. For some time, these species were all included as subspecies of &quot;Elanus caeruleus&quot;, which has been known as the black-shouldered kite.

The letter-winged kite breeds colonially and is nocturnal. The other species are both diurnal and crepuscular.

<doc id="453017" wikidata="Q1350728" url="?curid=453017" title="James Wyatt">
<text>James Wyatt (3 August 1746 – 4 September 1813) was an English architect, a rival of Robert Adam in the neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1785 and was its president from 1805 to 1806.

== Early life ==
Wyatt was born on 3 August 1746 at Weeford, near Lichfield, Staffordshire, England.

==Early classical career==
Wyatt spent six years in Italy, 1762–68, in company with Richard Bagot of Staffordshire, who was Secretary to Charles Compton, 7th Earl of Northampton&#x27;s embassy to the Venetian Republic. In Venice, Wyatt studied with Antonio Visentini (1688–1782) as an architectural draughtsman and painter. In Rome he made measured drawings of the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, &quot;being under the necessity of lying on his back on a ladder slung horizontally, without cradle or side-rail, over a frightful void of 300 feet&quot;.

Back in England, his selection as architect of the proposed Pantheon or &quot;Winter Ranelagh&quot; in Oxford Street, London, brought him almost unparalleled instant success. His brother Samuel was one of the principal promoters of the scheme, and it was doubtless due to him that the designs of a young and almost unknown architect were accepted by the committee. When the Pantheon was opened in 1772, their choice was at once endorsed by the fashionable public: Horace Walpole pronounced it to be &quot;the most beautiful edifice in England&quot;.
Externally it was unremarkable, but the classicising domed hall surrounded by galleried aisles and apsidal ends was something new in assembly rooms, and brought its architect immediate celebrity. The design was exhibited at the Royal Academy, private commissions followed, and at the age of 26 Wyatt found himself a fashionable domestic architect and on 27 August 1770 an Associate of the Royal Academy. His polished manners secured him friends as well as patrons among the great, and when it was rumoured that he was about to leave the country to become architect to Catherine II of Russia, a group of English noblemen is said to have offered him a retaining fee of £1,200 to remain in their service. His major neoclassical country houses include Heaton Hall near Manchester (1772), Heveningham Hall in Suffolk (circa 1788–99), and Castle Coole in Ireland, as well as Packington Hall, Staffordshire, the home of the Levett family for generations, and Dodington Park in Gloucestershire for the Codrington family. On 15 February 1785 Wyatt was elected an Academician of the Royal Academy, his diploma work being a drawing of the Darnley Mausoleum.
==Later classical work==
In later years, he carried out alterations at Frogmore for Queen Charlotte, and was made Surveyor-General of the Works. In about 1800, he was commissioned to carry out alterations to Windsor Castle which would probably have been much more considerable had it not been for George III&#x27;s illness, and in 1802 he designed for the King the &quot;strange castellated palace&quot; at Kew which was remarkable for the extensive employment of cast iron in its construction.

Between 1805 and 1808 Wyatt remodelled West Dean House in West Dean, West Sussex. Wyatt&#x27;s work was remarkable because it is built entirely of flint, even to the door and window openings, which would normally be lined with stone.

In 1776, Wyatt succeeded Henry Keene as Surveyor to Westminster Abbey (in which year he was appointed Elizabeth, Countess of Home&#x27;s architect on Home House, though he was sacked and replaced by Robert Adam a year later). In 1782 he became, in addition, Architect of the Ordnance. The death of Sir William Chambers brought him the post of Surveyor General and Comptroller of the Works in 1796.
Wyatt was now the principal architect of the day, the recipient of more commissions than he could well fulfil. His widespread practice and the duties of his official posts left him little time to give proper attention to the individual needs of his clients. As early as 1790, when he was invited to submit designs for rebuilding St Chad&#x27;s Church at Shrewsbury, he broke his engagements with such frequency that the committee &quot;became at length offended, and addressed themselves to Mr. George Stewart&quot;. In 1804, Jeffry Wyatt told Farington that his uncle had lost &quot;many great commissions&quot; by such neglect. When approached by a new client, he would at first take the keenest interest in the commission, but when the work was about to begin he would lose interest in it and &quot;employ himself upon trifling professional matters which others could do&quot;. His conduct of official business was no better than his treatment of his private clients, and there can be no doubt that it was Wyatt&#x27;s irresponsible habits which led to the reorganization of the Board of Works after his death, as a result of which the Surveyor&#x27;s office was placed in the hands of a political chief assisted by three &quot;attached architects&quot;.
Wyatt&#x27;s work is not characterized by any markedly individual style. At the time he began practice the fashionable architects were the brothers Adam, whose style of interior decoration he proceeded to imitate with such success that they complained of plagiarism in the introduction to their &quot;Works in Architecture&quot;, which appeared in 1773. Many years later Wyatt himself told George III that &quot;there had been no regular architecture since Sir William Chambers – that when he came from Italy he found the public taste corrupted by the Adams, and he was obliged to comply with it&quot;. Much of Wyatt&#x27;s classical work is, in fact, in a chastened Adam manner with ornaments in Coade stone and Etruscan-style medallions executed in many cases by the painter Biagio Rebecca, who was also employed by his rivals. It was not until towards the end of his life that he and his brother Samuel (with whom must be associated their nephew Lewis) developed the severe and fastidious style of domestic architecture which is characteristic of the Wyatt manner at its best. But among Wyatt&#x27;s earlier works there are several (e.g., the Christ Church gateway and the mausoleum at Cobham) which show a familiarity with Chambers&#x27; &quot;Treatise on the Decorative Part of Civil Architecture&quot;. Had he been given the opportunity of designing some great public building, it is possible that he would have shown himself a true disciple of Chambers; but his career as a government architect coincided with the Napoleonic wars, and his premature death deprived him of participation in the metropolitan improvements of the reign of George IV.

==Gothic architecture==

Meanwhile, Wyatt&#x27;s reputation as a rival to Robert Adam had been eclipsed by his celebrity as a Gothic architect. Every Georgian architect was called upon from time to time to produce designs in the medieval style, and Wyatt was by no means the first in the field. However, whereas his predecessors had merely Gothicized their elevations by the addition of battlements and pointed windows, Wyatt went further and exploited to the full the picturesque qualities of medieval architecture by irregular grouping and the addition of towers and spires to his silhouettes. Examples are his Fonthill Abbey (Wiltshire) and Ashridge (Hertfordshire); and although crude in scale and often unscholarly in detail, these houses are among the landmarks of the Gothic revival in England. In his lifetime Wyatt enjoyed the reputation of having &quot;revived in this country the long forgotten beauties of Gothic architecture&quot;, but the real importance of his Gothic work lay in the manner in which it bridged the gap between the rococo Gothic of the mid 18th century and the serious medievalism of the early 19th century.
His work on cathedrals at Salisbury, Durham, Hereford, and Lichfield was bitterly criticized by John Carter in his &quot;Pursuits of Architectural Innovation&quot;, and it was due in large measure to Carter&#x27;s persistent denunciation that, in 1796, Wyatt failed to secure election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the following year, however, he was permitted to add F.S.A. to his name by a majority of one hundred and twenty-three votes.

Wyatt was elected to the Royal Academy in 1785, and took an active part in the politics of the Academy. In 1803 he was one of the members of the Council which attempted to assert its independence of the General Assembly of Academicians, and when the resultant dissensions led Benjamin West to resign the Presidency in the following year, it was Wyatt who was elected to take his place. But his election was never formally approved by the King, and in the following year he appears to have acquiesced in West&#x27;s resumption of office. Wyatt was one of the founders of the Architects&#x27; Club in 1791, and sometimes presided at its meetings at the Thatched House Tavern.

In 1802, Wyatt built a new house for John Egerton, 7th Earl of Bridgewater on the Ashridge estate in Hertfordshire which is now a Grade I listed building. In 1803, Thomas Johnes hired Wyatt to design Saint Michel&#x27;s Hafod Church, Eglwys Newydd, in Ceredigion, Wales.

==Family and death==
Wyatt died on 4 September 1813 as the result of an accident to the carriage in which he was travelling over the Marlborough Downs with his friend and employer, Christopher Bethell-Codrington of Dodington Park. He was buried in Westminster Abbey.

He left a widow and four sons, of whom the eldest, Benjamin Dean, and the youngest, Philip, were notable architects. Matthew Cotes (1777–1862), the second son, became a well-known sculptor, whose best work is the bronze statue of George III in Cockspur Street off Trafalgar Square. Charles, the third son, was for a time in the service of the East India Company at Calcutta, but returned to England in 1801; nothing is known of his later career. His nephew Jeffry Wyatville was a noted architect, known for the renovation of Windsor Castle.

==Pupils and employees==
He had many pupils, of whom the following is an incomplete list: William Atkinson; W. Blogg; H. Brown; Joseph Dixon (perhaps a son of the draughtsman); John Foster, junior of Liverpool; J. M. Gandy; C. Humfrey; Henry Kitchen; James Wright Sanderson; R. Smith; Thomas and John Westmacott; M. Wynn; and his sons Benjamin and Philip Wyatt. Michael Gandy and P. J. Gandy-Deering were also in his office for a time.

Wyatt&#x27;s principal draughtsman was Joseph Dixon, who, according to Farington, had been with him from the time of the building of the Pantheon.

===Drawings===
Few original drawings by Wyatt are known to be in existence: but in the RIBA library there are designs by him for Badger Hall, Fonthill Abbey, Downing College, Cambridge, and Ashridge Park. The Royal Academy has drawings for the mausoleums at Brocklesby Park and Cobham Hall. An album of Wyatt&#x27;s sketches, in the possession of the Vicomte de Noailles, contains designs for chandeliers, torchères, vases, a plan for Lord Courtown, and more . Those for Slane Castle are in the Murray Collection of the National Library of Ireland.

==Portrayals==
There is a portrait in the RIBA library, and a pencil portrait by George Dance is in the Library of the Royal Academy. The National Portrait Gallery has a bronze bust of Wyatt by John Charles Felix Rossi.

<text>Enhanced-definition television, or extended-definition television (EDTV) is a Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) marketing shorthand term for certain digital television (DTV) formats and devices. Specifically, this term defines an extension of the standard-definition television (SDTV) format that enables a clearer picture during high-motion scenes compared to previous iterations of SDTV, but not producing images as detailed as high-definition television (HDTV).

The term refers to devices capable of displaying 480-line or 576-line signals in progressive scan, commonly referred to as 480p (NTSC-HQ) and 576p (PAL/SECAM) respectively, as opposed to interlaced scanning, commonly referred to as 480i (NTSC) or 576i (PAL, SECAM). High-motion is optional for EDTV.

In Australia, the 576p resolution standard was used by the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS TV) and Seven Network, being technically considered high-definition.

In Japan, the term is associated with improvements to analog NTSC called EDTV-I (or &quot;Clear-vision&quot;) and EDTV-II (or &quot;Wide-aspect Clear-vision&quot;) including ghost cancellation, digital sound or widescreen broadcasts, using a methods vaguely similar to PALPlus.

In Europe, it can be applied to analog PALPlus or MAC broadcasts. In other countries definitions may vary.

== Connectivity ==
As EDTV signals require more bandwidth (due to frame doubling) than is feasible with SDTV connection standards (such as composite video, SCART or S-Video), higher bandwidth media must be used to accommodate the additional data transfer. To achieve EDTV, consumer electronic devices such as a progressive scan DVD player or modern video game consoles must be connected through at least a component video cable (typically using 3 RCA cables for video), a VGA connector, or a DVI or HDMI connector. For over-the-air television broadcasts, EDTV content uses the same connectors as HDTV.

== Broadcast and displays ==
EDTV broadcasts use less digital bandwidth than HDTV, so TV stations can broadcast several EDTV stations at once. Like SDTV, EDTV signals are broadcast with non-square pixels. Since the same number of horizontal pixels are used in 4:3 and 16:9 broadcasts, the 16:9 mode is sometimes referred to as anamorphic widescreen. Most EDTV displays use square pixels, yielding a resolution of 852 × 480. However, since no broadcasts use this pixel count, such displays always scale anything they show. The only sources of 852 × 480 video are Internet downloads, such as some video games. Unlike 1080i and SDTV formats, progressive displays (such as plasma displays and LCDs) can show EDTV signals without the need to de-interlace them first. This can result in a reduction of motion artifacts. However to achieve this most progressive displays require the broadcast to be frame doubled (i.e., 25 to 50 and 30 to 60) to avoid the same motion flicker issues that interlacing fixes.

== Home media ==
The progressive output of a DVD player can be considered the baseline for EDTV. Movies shot at 24 frames-per-second (fps) are often encoded onto a DVD at 24 fps progressive. For telecine sources, most DVD players can do the 2:2 or 3:2 pulldown conversion dealing with deinterlacing internally, before feeding the output to a progressive 576p or 480p display.

Blu-ray Discs can encode all EDTV forms, but because HDTV is a primary selling point of Blu-ray, this is only used for certain bonus content such as featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews and behind the scenes documentaries on the making of the film.

== Gaming ==
The video resolution of video game consoles reached EDTV specifications starting with the Sega Dreamcast, becoming the first mainstream console with a VGA output, supporting EDTV. The PlayStation 2, GameCube, original Xbox and Wii are also EDTV compatible with a component connection. The Xbox 360 can output 480p via YPBPR component, VGA and HDMI (newer models only) cables. The PlayStation 3 outputs EDTV via its HDMI and component video (YPBPR) connections; 480p is only available on NTSC consoles while 576p is only available on PAL consoles.

Despite 576p being a valid output from the PS2&#x27;s component out, it is never used by any games released in PAL territories; instead the few games retaining progressive scan mode in their PAL localizations output in 480p. There are homebrew solutions available to force the output to progressive scan mode (which also in turn allows 60 Hz modes for 720p and 1080p: neither of which were otherwise used in any capacity officially).

<text>An elanine kite is any of several small, lightly-built raptors with long, pointed wings.

Some authorities list the group as a formal subfamily, Elaninae. As a subfamily there are six species in three genera with two of these genera being monotypic. Two other species have at times been included with the group, but genetic research has shown them to belong to different subfamilies.

Elanine kites have a near-worldwide distribution, with two endemic species found in the Americas, two in Australia, and one in Africa, while the black-winged kite is found over a vast range from Europe and Africa in the west to Southeast Asia in the east.

==Species==
===Current Elaninae===
===Previously in Elaninae===
* Genus &quot;Machaerhamphus&quot; or &quot;Macheiramphus&quot; (subfamily Harpiinae)
** Bat hawk, &quot;M. alcinus&quot; – Paleotropics (Africa, south Asia through to New Guinea)
* Genus &quot;Elanoides&quot; (subfamily Perninae)
** Swallow-tailed kite, &quot;Elanoides forficatus&quot; – Americas

==Description==

&quot;Elanus&quot; species are primarily rodent hunters, searching for prey from a perch or often hovering like kestrels. Their tail is unforked. &quot;Chelictinia&quot; feeds on the wing, taking insects from the air, or small reptiles and insects from tree branches. Its tail is very long and deeply forked, like &quot;Elanoides&quot; which has similar feeding habits but is larger.

Both &quot;Elanus&quot; and &quot;Chelictinia&quot; have similarities in markings, with red eyes, a black patch above the eye, yellow legs and cere, and black beak.

&quot;Gampsonyx&quot; is very small, also feeding on insects, with the size and coloration typical of the Asian falconets. It is black above and white below, often with a tinge of rufous around the legs.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

In 1851 British zoologist Edward Blyth described Elaninae, the &quot;smooth clawed kites&quot;, as a formal subfamily of Accipitridae. However they are also grouped in Accipitrinae, the broader subfamily of hawks and eagles described by French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816.

Nicholas Vigors in 1824 had grouped &quot;Elanus&quot; and &quot;true &quot;Milvus&quot;&quot; together into &quot;Stirps Milvina&quot;, the kites. Earlier, the terms &quot;kite&quot; in English or &quot;iktinos&quot; in Greek referred only to the red or black (milvine) kites. French ornithologists used the term &quot;milan&quot; for both the milvine and elanine kites.

Around the same time, in 1823, Louis-Pierre Vieillot had placed the group (in five species) together into his own genus &quot;Elanoïdes&quot;, rather than Savigny&#x27;s &quot;Elanus&quot;. Vigors listed three known species: &quot;Elanus melanopterus&quot;, &quot;E. furcatus&quot;, and &quot;E. Riocourii&quot;. But he noted that the latter two had more forked tails and probably didn&#x27;t have nails that were rounded underneath. The following year he gained access to specimens of the fork-tailed kites and split them from &quot;Elanus&quot; into a separate genus, &quot;Nauclerus&quot;.

In 1931, Peters used the subfamily Elaninae, listing its members as &quot;Elanus&quot;, &quot;Chelictinia&quot;, and &quot;Machaeramphus&quot;. He placed &quot;Elanoïdes&quot; in subfamily Perninae, and &quot;Gampsonyx&quot; with the forest falcons in Polyhieracinae. In the 1950s, several authors found &quot;Gampsonyx&quot; was related to &quot;Elanus&quot; rather than the falcons, based on morphological features and molt schedule.

Lerner and Mindell describe the Elaninae as: &quot;Kites noted for having a bony shelf above the eye, &quot;Elanus&quot; is cosmopolitan, &quot;Gampsonyx&quot; is restricted to the New World and &quot;Chelictinia&quot; is found in Africa&quot;. 
This is in contrast to the Perninae, which are: &quot;Kites mainly found in the tropics and specializing on insects and bee or wasp larvae, all lack the bony eye shield found in the Elaninae&quot;.

Comparisons of sequences for certain mitochondrial marker genes indicate that some elanine kites split early from the rest of the Accipitridae. Wink and Sauer-Gurth found that &quot;Elanus&quot; was less related than the osprey and secretary bird (which are often placed in a separate family), but noted that this was not strongly indicated. However, Lerner and Mindell found that the osprey was less related, but &quot;Elanus leucurus&quot; was basal to the other Accipitridae.

Negro and colleagues have discussed convergent traits between kites in the genus &quot;Elanus&quot; and owls, such as a lower acidity of the stomach and some specialized flight feathers otherwise not found in diurnal raptors.

Lerner and Mindell also found that &quot;Elanoides forficatus&quot; grouped with Perninae, such as the type species &quot;Pernis apivorus&quot; and the Australian endemics &quot;Lophoictinia&quot; and &quot;Hamirostra&quot;. &quot;Chelictinia&quot;, &quot;Machaerhamphus&quot;, and &quot;Gampsonyx&quot; were not included in these genetic sequencing studies.

<text>The Territory of Orleans or Orleans Territory was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from October 1, 1804, until April 30, 1812, when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Louisiana.

== History ==
In 1804, all of the Louisiana Purchase south of the 33rd parallel became the Orleans Territory, and the remainder became the District of Louisiana. (The District of Louisiana was later renamed the Louisiana Territory; and still later, when the Orleans Territory became the State of Louisiana, the Louisiana Territory was renamed the Missouri Territory.)

The Organic Act of 1804, passed on March 26 for October 1 implementation, also created the United States District Court for the District of Orleans—the only time Congress has ever provided a territory with a United States district court equal in its authority and jurisdiction to those of the states. Congress also established the Superior Court for the Territory of Orleans whose three judges were the top territorial court.

On April 10, 1805, the Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties (starting from the southeast corner moving west and north): Orleans, Lafourche, German Coast, Acadia, Iberville, Attakapas, Pointe Coupée, Opelousas, Rapides, Concordia, Natchitoches, and Ouachita. These were replaced in 1807 by 19 civil parishes.

The area that later became the Florida Parishes on the east side of the Mississippi River was not included in Orleans Territory at this time, as it was in the Spanish territory of West Florida. This area was formally appended to the territory on April 14, 1812, after having been annexed forcibly by the U.S. in 1810, although Spain did not formally relinquish any of West Florida until 1821. The western boundary with Spanish Texas was not fully defined until the Adams–Onís Treaty was negotiated in 1819. A strip of land known as the Sabine Free State just east of the Sabine River served as a neutral ground buffer area from about 1807 until the treaty took effect after ratification in 1821.

The Orleans Territory was the site of the largest slave revolt in American history, the 1811 German Coast Uprising.

In the 1810 United States census, 20 parishes in the Orleans Territory reported the following population counts:

==Leaders and representatives==
William C. C. Claiborne was appointed Governor of the Orleans Territory; he held this position throughout the territorial period. Later he became the first Governor of the state of Louisiana.

There were two Territorial Secretaries, James Brown (1804–1807) and Thomas B. Robertson (1807–1811). Daniel Clark became the first Territorial Delegate to the U.S. Congress, in December 1806. Judge Dominic Augustin Hall was the U.S. District Judge of the Territory.

Judges of the Superior Court were John Bartow Prevost (1804–1808), Ephraim Kirby (1804) (died en route to New Orleans), Peter Stephen Du Ponceau (1804) (declined President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s appointment), William Sprigg (1805–1807), George Mathews, Jr. (1805–1813), Joshua Lewis (1807–1813), and Francois Xavier Martin (1810–1813).

At its first meeting on December 3, 1804, the territory&#x27;s Legislative Council consisted of Julien de Lallande Poydras, William Kenner, John Watkins, William Wikoff, Benjamin Morgan, Eugene Dorcier, and George Pollock.

<doc id="453036" wikidata="Q186610" url="?curid=453036" title="Time loop">
<text>The time loop or temporal loop is a plot device in fiction whereby characters re-experience a span of time which is repeated, sometimes more than once, with some hope of breaking out of the cycle of repetition. Time loops are constantly resetting; when a certain condition is met, such as a death of a character or a certain point in time, the loop starts again, possibly with one or more characters retaining the memories from the previous loop.

The term &quot;time loop&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to a sequence of events involving travel back in time, in which the chain of causality is circular.

==History==
An early example of a time loop is the 1915 Russian novel &quot;Strange Life of Ivan Osokin&quot;, where the main character gets to live his life over again but struggles to change it the second time around. The episode &quot;The Man Who Murdered Time&quot; in the radio drama The Shadow was broadcast on 1 January 1939, about a dying scientist who invents a time machine stuck on 31 December. The short story &quot;Doubled and Redoubled&quot; by Malcolm Jameson that appeared in the February 1941 &quot;Unknown&quot; tells of a person accidentally cursed to repeat a &quot;perfect&quot; day, including a lucky bet, a promotion, a heroically foiled bank robbery, and a successful wedding proposal. More recent examples include the 1973 short story &quot;12:01 PM&quot; and its 1990 and 1993 film adaptations, the Soviet film &quot;Mirror for a Hero&quot; (1988), the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Cause And Effect&quot; (1992), the American films &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; (1993), &quot;Naked&quot; (2017), &quot;Happy Death Day&quot; (2017), &quot;Happy Death Day 2U&quot; (2019), and &quot;Palm Springs&quot; (2020), the British, found footage, psychological, analog horror web series &quot;No Through Road&quot; (2009–2012), and the Indian, Tamil-language, science fiction, political action thriller film &quot;Maanaadu.&quot; Time loops have been used as a recurring theme in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, with the episode &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; being described as &quot;Doctor Who&#x27;s definitive loop-based story&quot;.

===Japanese popular culture===
The time loop is a popular trope in Japanese pop culture media, especially anime. Its use in Japanese fiction dates back to Yasutaka Tsutsui&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot; (1965), one of the earliest works to feature a time loop, about a high school girl who repeatedly relives the same day. It was later adapted into a 1972 live-action Japanese television series, a hit 1983 live-action film, a 2006 anime film, and a 2010 live-action film. The 1983 live-action film adaptation of &quot;The Girl Who Leapt Through Time&quot; was a major box office success in Japan, where it was the second highest-grossing Japanese film of 1983. Its success was soon followed by numerous anime and manga using the time loop concept, starting with Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s anime film &quot;Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer&quot; (1984), and then the manga and anime series &quot;Kimagure Orange Road&quot; (1984–1988).

The time loop has since become a familiar anime trope. Other popular Japanese works that use the time loop concept include Hiroyuki Kanno&#x27;s science fiction visual novel &quot;YU-NO: A Girl Who Chants Love at the Bound of this World&quot; (1996), the visual novel and anime franchise &quot;Higurashi When They Cry&quot; (2002), the light novel and anime franchise &quot;Haruhi Suzumiya&quot; (2003), Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s Japanese cyberpunk anime film &quot;Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence&quot; (2004), Hiroshi Sakurazaka&#x27;s sci-fi light novel &quot;All You Need is Kill&quot; (2004) which was adapted into the Tom Cruise starring Hollywood film &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), and the sci-fi visual novel and anime franchise &quot;Steins;Gate&quot; (2009).

==As a puzzle==
Stories with time loops commonly center on the character learning from each successive loop through time. Jeremy Douglass, Janet Murray, Noah Falstein and others compare time loops with video games and other interactive media, where a character in a loop learns about their environment more and more with each passing loop, and the loop ends with complete mastery of the character&#x27;s environment. Shaila Garcia-Catalán et al. provide a similar analysis, saying that the usual way for the protagonist out of a time loop is acquiring knowledge, using retained memories to progress and eventually exit the loop. The time loop is then a problem-solving process, and the narrative becomes akin to an interactive puzzle.

The presentation of a time loop as a puzzle has subsequently led to video games that are centered on the time loop mechanic, giving the player the ability to learn and figure out the rules themselves. Games like &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot;, &quot;Minit&quot;, &quot;The Sexy Brutale&quot;, &quot;Outer Wilds&quot;, &quot;12 Minutes&quot;, &quot;Returnal&quot; and &quot;Deathloop&quot; were all designed to allow the player to figure out the loop&#x27;s sequences of events and then navigate their character through a loop a final time to successfully complete the game. According to Raul Rubio, the CEO of Tequila Works that created &quot;The Sexy Brutale&quot;, &quot;Time loops allow players to train to get better at the game, faster, smarter, by experimenting from a fixed starting situation, and seeing what it works to move &#x27;forward&#x27; within the loop and adding something else to that structure to build a solid process.&quot;

<text>Malaybalay, officially the City of Malaybalay (Binukid: &quot;Bánuwa ta Malaybaláy&quot;), is a component city and capital of the province of Bukidnon, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 190,712 people.

The city, dubbed as the &quot;South Summer Capital of the Philippines&quot;, is bordered north by Impasugong; west by Lantapan; south by Valencia and San Fernando; and east by Cabanglasan and Agusan del Sur.

It was formerly part of the province of Misamis Oriental as a municipal district in the late 19th century. When the special province of Agusan (now Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur) and its sub-province (Bukidnon) were created in 1907, Malaybalay was designated as the capital of Bukidnon. It was then formally established as a municipality on October 19, 1907, and was created into a city on February 11, 1998, by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 8490&quot;.

Malaybalay City is the venue of the Kaamulan Festival, held annually from mid-February to March 10.

== History ==
Historiographic accounts for Malaybalay are scarce, and conflicting narratives further obscure the actual history of the city due to the oral nature of passing information by the Indigenous peoples and the incomplete accounts of Spanish registries in the region.

=== Precolonial history ===
Malaybalay is one of the few villages in central Mindanao that was founded by the natives. People who live in present-day Malaybalay and most of Northern Mindanao and parts of Caraga now call themselves Higaonon. Higaonon tribal chieftains claim a city was built at the confluence (&quot;sabangán&quot;) of the Kibalabag and Can-ayan Rivers, at which point the Tagoloan River begins and is considered a sacred place by the tribe. They never converted to Islam like the tribes in Cotabato and Lanao.

=== Spanish period, 17th to 19th century ===

The Spanish, who arrived in the area in the 18th century, already saw thriving communities along the Tagoloan River. In 1815, the Province of Misamis was created, which included areas of present-day Bukidnon. However, some skirmishes with the Spanish administration existed, such as the burning of Kalasungay village in 1850 by Spanish authorities, although the cause of such incident is conflicting. Nonetheless it dispersed the survivors into neighboring villages such as Silae and Silipon (now Dalwangan). A group established a new settlement near the Sacub River (a spring near present-day Rizal Park), led by Datù Mampaalong. In June 15, 1877, in an accord between the Spanish government and Mampaalong with 30 other datù, their settlement called Malaybalay was incorporated into Misamis. At the same event, Mampaalong and his people embraced Christianity. Spanish registries incorporated Malaybalay as the &quot;pueblo&quot; Oroquieta, in the town of Sevilla (now Mailag), administered by the clergy. Other settlements, namely Kalasungay (&quot;Calasungay&quot;), Linabo, Silae, Valencia, Bugcaon, Alanib (&quot;Covadonga&quot;), Monserrat (may refer to either Lumbayao or Lurugan), and Lepanto (may refer to Maramag) were also incorporated into the town in separate occasions. Although Mailag was the designated town proper by the Spanish government, it was Linabo that served as the seat of town government. Malaybalay was then a barrio headed by an appointed cabeza de barangay.

=== American occupation, 1898-1946 ===
During the American occupation, administrative structure of Mindanao underwent complete overhaul. The Province of Misamis was dissolved forming the current provinces of Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental. Likewise, the Philippine Commission then headed by Commissioner Dean C. Worcester, Secretary of Interior and a member of the Philippine Commission proposed the creation of a province of Bukidnon. With it, the local administration of Sevilla was considered defunct.
On August 20, 1907, the Philippine Commission Act No. 1693 was enacted creating the sub-province of Bukidnon. Malaybalay was then formally created as a municipality on October 19, 1907, replacing Mailag. It included the barrios of the former Sevilla except for Maramag, which became a separate Municipality. Dalwangan, formerly a village under Sumilao during the Spanish administration, was also incorporated within Malaybalay. When Bukidnon was declared as a regular province and become an independent political unit on March 10, 1917, by virtue of the creation of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Act 2711, Malaybalay was designated as its provincial capital.

=== World War II and Japanese occupation, 1942-1945 ===
During the Second World War, in 1942, the Japanese occupation troops entered Bukidnon. They occupied Malaybalay, establishing a camp in Casisang. Guerrilla groups operating around Malaybalay made frequent raids on the Japanese camps from the time of the occupation until the arrival of the Americans. In 1945 American liberation forces, together with the Philippine Commonwealth Forces and Filipino guerrillas, liberated Malaybalay.

=== Postwar Malaybalay ===
Malaybalay was one of the few municipalities and municipal districts comprising Bukidnon and in the decades that followed, several municipalities were created from Malaybalay&#x27;s far-flung but populous barangays. These municipalities eventually became San Fernando (1959, from 8 barrios), Valencia (1961, from 13 barrios), Lantapan (1968, from 12 barrios), and Cabanglasan (1979, from 15 barrios). As the capital town, most economic activity was centered here until it shifted to the more centrally located Valencia, its daughter town. In 1980, Valencia overtook Malaybalay as the most populous municipality.

===Cityhood===

On March 26, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan of the municipality of Malaybalay passed Resolution No. 3699-96 petitioning to the House of Representatives for the conversion of Malaybalay into a city. Reginaldo Tilanduca, 2nd District Representative of Bukidnon at that time, filed House Bill No. 6275, proposing the creation of Malaybalay into a component city. On March 22, 1998, President Fidel Ramos signed the act (R.A. 8490) that converted Malaybalay to a city, making it the first component city of Bukidnon.

== Geography ==
Malaybalay, the capital city of Bukidnon, is in the central part of the province. It is bounded in the east by the municipality of Cabanglasan and the Pantaron Range, which separates Bukidnon from the provinces of Agusan del Sur and Davao del Norte; on the west by the municipality of Lantapan and Mount Kitanglad; on the north by the municipality of Impasugong; and on the south by Valencia City and the municipality of San Fernando.

The whole eastern and southeastern border adjoining Agusan del Sur and Davao del Norte is elevated and densely forested mountains, which is one of the few remaining forest blocks of Mindanao. The nearest seaports and airports are in Cagayan de Oro, which is 91 kilometers away.

=== Barangays ===

Malaybalay is politically subdivided into 46 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

These barangays are conveniently grouped into 5 geographical districts, namely the Poblacion District, North Highway District, South Highway District, Basakan District, and Upper Pulangi District.


=== Climate ===
The climate classification of Malaybalay falls under the Fourth Type or intermediate B type, which is characterized by the absence of a pronounced maximum period and dry season. Rain falls at a yearly average of and occurs throughout the year, though it is more intense during the summer season from April to September. Outside these months, January to March receive less rain and October to December are intermediate. Compared with the rest of the country, the climate in Malaybalay is moderate all year round and the area is not on the typhoon belt.

=== Land area ===

The total land area of the city is , that is about 13% of the total area of Bukidnon. An estimated of 65% of this is classified as forestland/timberland and the remaining 35% is alienable and disposable areas: lands which could be used for purposes such as for agriculture or for industry.

The city plays a strategic role in the protection of the headwater source of the Pulangi and the Tagoloan rivers because of its location the upper portion of both watershed areas. The Pulangi River then extends through the Cotabato provinces as the Rio Grande de Mindanao and to Cotabato City, where it empties into Illana Bay. The Tagoloan River, on the other hand, traverses northwestward toward Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental, where it joins Macajalar Bay. These watershed areas provided potable water, irrigation, hydro-electric power, and recreation and tourism activities.

=== Topography and soil type ===

The average elevation of the city is above sea level. About 60% of the city&#x27;s area has above 30% slope, characterized by steep hills, mountains, and cliff-like stream side. About 25% are level, gently sloping, and undulating. The rest are rolling and hilly.

One of prominent geographical structure in the city is the Kitanglad Mountain Range, located in the western frontier, on its border with Lantapan and Impasugong. Some barangays (Dalwangan, Capitan Bayong, Imbayao and Mampayag) are in the foothills of this mountain range. Steep hills are found in the central portion of the city (Kibalabag, Manalog and Can-ayan), where the Tagoloan River headwater can be found. The Central Mindanao Cordillera (Pantaron Mountain Range), is on the eastern side of the city, in its boundaries with Agusan del Sur province. The Pulangi River cuts across the area between the hills in the central part and the Central Cordillera in the eastern part, creating a portion of the Upper Pulangi river valley. The southern portion of the city is made up of level to undulating area, a river valley created by the Sawaga River and the Manupali River, which are both tributaries of the Pulangi River.

About 66% of the city&#x27;s soil is identified as undifferentiated mountain soil and the rest are clay. The predominant types of clay are Kidapawan, Alimodian and Adtuyon, which are generally good for agriculture.

== Demography ==

Malaybalay is originally the home of the Bukidnon &quot;lumads&quot; or natives, but there has been an influx of settlers and immigrants from the Visayas and Luzon for the last four decades contributing to the growth of the population. The original inhabitants, the Bukidnons, have retreated to the hinterlands as the migrants continued to occupy and dominate the population centers in the city. Malaybalay is the second most populous political subdivision in the province, after Valencia.

The historical growth of population of the city showed a variable pattern of growth (See Figure). The first census of population was made in 1918 with Malaybalay having only 16,428 inhabitants. The 21 years from 1918 to 1939 was a low-growth period with the city&#x27;s population growing at a 0.6% annually. This was then followed by a period of population decline until the post-World War II era, declining by 1.5% per year. The 12-year period from 1948 to 1960 is a period of high growth, when the city&#x27;s population almost doubled from its 1948 level. This pace of growth continued until 1970, growing 6.7%. In 1970, Malaybalay has 65,918 inhabitants. A 5-year period of declining growth followed, the population dropped to 60,779. After the decline, Malaybalay&#x27;s population has been increasing since then, growing by 3.4% from 1990 to 1995 and by 1.9% from 1995 to 2000.

The city is predominantly rural, with only 16% of the population in urban areas, 40% in urbanizing barangays and 46% in rural areas. Population is evenly distributed in the urban and rural areas. The urban areas are generally found on the confines of the Sayre Highway (also known in the city as &quot;Fortich Street&quot;) that traverses the city. The main urban population is found in the Poblacion-Casisang-Sumpong area. Secondary population centers includes barangays Aglayan, Bangcud, Kalasungay and San Jose.

Malaybalay has one of the lowest average population density in the province, second only to Impasug-ong with only 146 persons per square kilometer although there are barangays, especially in the Poblacion area, with high population density.

Cebuano and Binukid are prevailing mediums of communication in the city. More than half of the city&#x27;s population are speakers of these languages. Other languages such as Maranao are spoken by the Maranaos. Hiligaynon is also spoken by the descendants of the Hiligaynon/Ilonggo settlers in the city.

=== Religion ===

The majority of the population, about 77% of the population, follow Christianity, with Roman Catholicism as the largest religion. Malaybalay is the center of the Diocese of Malaybalay which covers the province of Bukidnon (except for the municipality of Malitbog which is under the Archdiocese of Cagayan de Oro), the municipality of Wao, Lanao del Sur, and Barangay Buda in Davao City. It covers an area of 8, 294 square kilometers. San Isidro the Farmer Cathedral is the largest church in the city which is located beside Plaza Rizal. Other Christian religions present are the Aglipayans, United Methodist, Baptists, Seventh Day Adventists, Born again, Iglesia ni Cristo and the UCCP.

The remainder 23% belong to non-Christian faiths, mainly adherent of Islam. The believers of Islam are mainly Maranao, Maguindanaon and Balik Islam (converts to Islam). There are many mosques that can be found in the city. Malaybalay Grand Mosque is the largest mosque in the city which also serves as the Islamic Center of Bukidnon. There are also sizeable adherents of Buddhism and animism in the city.

== Economy ==
The city is mainly an agricultural area, and its products include rice, corn, sugarcane, vegetables, legumes, root crops and commercial crops such as rubber, coffee, banana and pineapple. During the past years, corn used to be the pre-dominant crop in the city. But as the corn areas gave way to sugarcane, agri-farms (poultry, hog), and residential areas, sugarcane (306,600 metric tons) and rice (30,318 MT) came out now as the predominant crops in terms of production volume. These products are usually sold in the local market, or in nearby municipalities of the province. There are also farmers producing larger volume of corn and rice who sell their products in Cagayan de Oro.
Agri-based industries primarily poultry and piggery, now flourish in the city. These farms are assisted by big corporations such as San Miguel, Purefoods, Monterey and Swift. Other agri-based industries in the City include Asian Hybrid Philippines (feeds processing), Rubber Tex (rubber shoes manufacturing), and Monastery Farms (peanuts and other preserved foods). Also notable are the 12 cattle ranches that produce an average of 470 heads yearly.

Data from the License Department of the City showed that a majority or 95.87% of the establishments in the City belong to the service sector. Looking at the breakdown, sari-sari stores (37%) make up majority of the establishments in this sector, followed by trade/wholesale/retails (21%) and other, social and personal services (14%). Industry Sector and Agriculture Sector only make up only 2.27% and 1.9% respectively of all establishments.
There is no data available on the employment per sector from the NSO that is specific for Malaybalay, thus the CPDO collected data from DTI, License Department, and City Agriculture Office to get the distribution of employment per industrial sector. The result showed that 70% of employment is in the farming/ crop production sector followed by government agencies and commercial/private establishments. Agri-industries and service sectors registered only about 1.63% and 5.99% respectively. The lowest is the manufacturing/processing sector at only 0.36%.
So far 3 spring resorts, 5 plazas/nature parks have been developed in the city. Other natural sites such as forest, industrial tree plantation sites, mountains, falls, rivers and caves are still to be developed for eco-tourism.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===

;&quot;Roads and highways&quot;

There are about 820.89 kilometers of road linking the different parts of the city. 102.70 km or 12.51% are classified as National Road, 60.40 km or 7.36% Provincial Road, 61.35 km or 7.47% City Road, and 596.44 km or 72.66% barangay roads. About 14.14% of all roads in the city are paved, that is, either concrete or asphalt. These are in the poblacion areas. At least 85.86% are unpaved (gravel or earth filled). These are primarily the barangay roads. These unpaved roads leading to the rural barangays usually require regular maintenance since they are easily destroyed by heavy rains. There are also logging roads leading to the forestal communities, but these are usually passable by farm animals and single motor cycles only, making it hard for communities to transport products into the market.

Connecting the various road networks and cutting across rivers and creeks are at least 22 bridges of various types. Almost all of these bridges are said to be in good condition. There are 15 bridges or 69.35% totaling to about 470.67 m in length that are administered nationally, while 3 bridges of about 115.00 m are under the province&#x27;s administration. Only about 93.00 m or about 13.70% are under the administration of city and barangays.

The Sayre Highway bisects the Poblacion, the main urban center of the city, serving as the main thoroughfare of the city. Buses that ply the Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Butuan (not operational) and Davao City route, as well as jeepneys, multi-cabs, vans and private vehicles pass through this highway. Suburbs are served by multicabs, &quot;motorelas&quot; and improvised bicycles (&quot;trisikads&quot;).

The current main highway in the city center is now congested. Heavy traffic and congestion has been observed in the main highway, especially during peak hours. The absence of proper and adequate parking areas further contributes to the congestion. The situation underlies the need for a bypass road as well as more traffic aides. The city has two proposed roads to answer the above concerns. The first proposal is the Circumferential Road from Sumpong to DPWH Depot in Casisang, which is 2.5 km. in length. The other is the by-pass road from Dalwangan to San Jose with a total stretch of 15 km. The Butuan-Malaybalay Road becomes the secondary road connecting Esperanza, Agusan del Sur, which is scheduled to complete in the future but this could be a private transport.

;&quot;Public transportation&quot;
There are various types of public transportation. Buses that ply the Bukidnon, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Butuan and Davao City route are used for travel from the city to other provinces. There are also mini-vans that transport passengers from Cagayan de Oro to Malaybalay. The multi-cabs ply the main highway from the poblacion proper to other points of destination within the city and nearby barangays. The four-wheeled motorelas are limited to the inner streets. Recently, tri-sikads have also begun to operate in the inner streets of Barangay Sumpong. Jeepneys are usually used for travel from the poblacion to other barangays and municipalities. In far-flung areas, motorcycles (habal-habal) are the fastest means of transportation.

The main terminal for public transportation vehicles is in the public market, especially for buses, mini-vans, and jeepneys. For motorelas and tri-sikads, street-corners of convergence serve as terminals or waiting areas.

With the increase in traffic of both vehicles and pedestrians, especially in the poblacion, there is a growing concern for better and safer organized streets. There is a need to designate walking pavements or pedestrian lanes, including pedestrian overpass especially for the use of children and students crossing the major highway.

;&quot;Airports and seaports&quot;
Malaybalay once had an airport located at Barangay Casisang but closed in the 1990s by the provincial government to give land for housing; the nearest one is the Laguindingan Airport in Cagayan de Oro. The city also relies on the Cagayan de Oro seaport for the delivery of its products to other destinations in the Philippines as it is the closest port to the city.

;&quot;Housing Development&quot;
To close the housing gap of 6.5 million between 2017 and 2020, the government needs to build 250,000 houses a year. Currently, however, the housing sector can only build 203,000 to 205,000 units annually between 2016 and 2019.

Housing developments in Malaybalay includes Salang Homes Subdivision, Lumina Homes, Greenfields Subdivision, Dumalahay Subdivision, and Legacie Country Homes.

=== Utilities ===

;&quot;Electricity&quot;
All the 46 barangays are already energized. Majority or 57.07% of the city&#x27;s households have electricity for lighting. 39.88% of households still use kerosene.

Malaybalay is served by the &quot;Bukidnon Second Electric Cooperative Incorporated&quot; or BUSECO, which started its operations in 1979 (Table 77: Number of Connections by Type of Users and Average Consumption). Recent data from BUSECO indicate a total of 16,157 power connections. Of these 14,107 or 87.31% are residential connections, while 1,454 or 9.00% are commercial establishments.

While the number of household connections is 9 times more than the combined industrial and commercial connections, the average monthly consumption of households is 3.06% less than the latter. In actual number, businesses use at least 73,560.39 kWh per month more than households. This trend is not surprising because businesses tend to use more electricity than households.

However, the data underlines the need to plan ahead to ensure that there is enough power supply for the city&#x27;s growing power demands. Already, at least 43% of the population remains without electricity and those who do have experience regular power outage. This sector needs attention especially with the expected increase in population as well as business establishments.

;&quot;Water&quot;

The water system and services of Malaybalay is provided by &quot;Malaybalay City Water District&quot; (MCWD) in which its office is located in Barangay Sumpong.

;&quot;Telecommunications, Media and Courier Services&quot;
There are 2 major telephone companies in the city, the Southern Telecommunications Company (SOTELCO) and Philcom. Both Philcom and Sotelco offer Internet connections. Mobile phone services available in the city include Globe, Smart, TM and Sun. With the growing demand for better communication systems companies are facing the challenge of providing better and higher quality services to the population.

Broadcast media include 5 radio and 2 television repeater stations, including a cable station. Most national dailies such as the Philippine Daily Inquirer and Philippine Star are available. Local newspapers include the Bukidnon Newswatch, Gold Star Daily and Bukidnon Plateau.

There are 4 major courier services available in the city for national and international forwarding. The post office, the Bureau of Telecommunication and 2 telegraphic companies serve other communication needs.

The telecommunication technologies have continued to improve over the years. But the mode of communication in the upland barangays are still the old and tested letter sending through vehicle drivers and broadcasting over the public radio stations.

The city&#x27;s mobile and internet services are provided by Globe Telecom, PLDT, Parasat Cable TV and Smart Communications.

=== Law enforcement ===
The Malaybalay Police Station is responsible for the protection of the city&#x27;s population against crime. Data for year 2005 indicate that the police force is 76 and serving a population of 136,210. This translates to a ratio of 1 policeman for every 1,792 persons in the city. Ideal ratio for police to population is 1:500 and the minimum standard police-population ratio is 1:1,000. In terms of area coverage, this translates to 1 policeman for every 1,424 hectares.

There are 9 police community precincts located in Sumpong, Dalwangan, Casisang, Aglayan, Managok, Bangcud, Zamboangita, Can-ayan and Barangay 9 (Public Market). The police force to population ratio is highest in Casisang with 1 policeman for every 13,874 individuals. Lowest ratio is in Sumpong with 1:151. A low ratio indicates that there are more policemen available to serve the population of a given area.

Further analysis indicates that based on the total population, the number of existing police force and the minimum police-population ratio of 1:1,000, the city still needs 606 policemen.

Malaybalay City host 2 military and police camps. One is the Camp Ramon M. Onahon, located at Barangay 7. It is the provincial headquarters of the Philippine National Police. The other one is Camp Osito Bahian, located at Impalambong, Barangay 10. It is the home of the 403rd Infantry Brigade

<text>In mathematics, orthogonal functions belong to a function space that is a vector space equipped with a bilinear form. When the function space has an interval as the domain, the bilinear form may be the integral of the product of functions over the interval:
:formula_1

The functions formula_2 and formula_3 are orthogonal when this integral is zero, i.e. formula_4 whenever formula_5. As with a basis of vectors in a finite-dimensional space, orthogonal functions can form an infinite basis for a function space. Conceptually, the above integral is the equivalent of a vector dot product; two vectors are mutually independent (orthogonal) if their dot-product is zero.

Suppose formula_6 is a sequence of orthogonal functions of nonzero &quot;L&quot;2-norms formula_7. It follows that the sequence formula_8 is of functions of &quot;L&quot;2-norm one, forming an orthonormal sequence. To have a defined &quot;L&quot;2-norm, the integral must be bounded, which restricts the functions to being square-integrable.

==Trigonometric functions==

Several sets of orthogonal functions have become standard bases for approximating functions. For example, the sine functions and are orthogonal on the interval formula_9 when formula_10 and &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are positive integers. For then 
:formula_11
and the integral of the product of the two sine functions vanishes. Together with cosine functions, these orthogonal functions may be assembled into a trigonometric polynomial to approximate a given function on the interval with its Fourier series.

==Polynomials==

If one begins with the monomial sequence formula_12 on the interval formula_13 and applies the Gram–Schmidt process, then one obtains the Legendre polynomials. Another collection of orthogonal polynomials are the associated Legendre polynomials.

The study of orthogonal polynomials involves weight functions formula_14 that are inserted in the bilinear form:
:formula_15
For Laguerre polynomials on formula_16 the weight function is formula_17.

Both physicists and probability theorists use Hermite polynomials on formula_18, where the weight function is formula_19 or formula_20.

Chebyshev polynomials are defined on formula_13 and use weights formula_22 or formula_23.

Zernike polynomials are defined on the unit disk and have orthogonality of both radial and angular parts.

==Binary-valued functions==
Walsh functions and Haar wavelets are examples of orthogonal functions with discrete ranges.

==Rational functions==

Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials provide orthogonal families for the interval while occasionally orthogonal families are required on . In this case it is convenient to apply the Cayley transform first, to bring the argument into . This procedure results in families of rational orthogonal functions called Legendre rational functions and Chebyshev rational functions.

==In differential equations==
Solutions of linear differential equations with boundary conditions can often be written as a weighted sum of orthogonal solution functions (a.k.a. eigenfunctions), leading to generalized Fourier series.

<doc id="453045" wikidata="Q1395913" url="?curid=453045" title="Fantasy Island">
<text>Fantasy Island is an American fantasy drama television series created by Gene Levitt. It aired on ABC from 1977 to 1984. The series starred Ricardo Montalbán as the mysterious Mr. Roarke and Hervé Villechaize as his assistant, Tattoo. Guests were granted so-called &quot;fantasies&quot; on the island for a price.

A one-season revival of the series aired 14 years later in 1998 while a horror-themed prequel film was released on February 14, 2020. That same year, it was announced that a sequel of the series was being produced at Fox; it premiered on August 10, 2021.

==Background==
Before it became a television series, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; was introduced to viewers in 1977 and 1978 through two made-for-television films. Airing from 1978 to 1984, the original series starred Ricardo Montalbán as Mr. Roarke, the enigmatic overseer of a mysterious island somewhere near Devil&#x27;s Island, French Guiana in the Atlantic Ocean, where people from all walks of life could come and live out their fantasies, albeit for a price.

Roarke was known for his white suit and cultured demeanor, and he was initially accompanied by an energetic sidekick, Tattoo, played by Hervé Villechaize. Tattoo would run up the main bell tower to ring the bell and shout &quot;De plane! De plane!&quot; to announce the arrival of a new set of guests at the beginning of each episode. This line, shown at the beginning of the series&#x27; credits, became a catchphrase because of Villechaize&#x27;s spirited delivery and French accent. In later seasons, he would arrive in his personal go-kart, sized for him, and recklessly drive to join Roarke for the visitor reception while the staff scrambled to get out of his way. From 1981 to 1982, Wendy Schaal joined the cast as a beautiful brown-eyed blonde assistant named Julie; in the season five story &quot;The Case Against Mr. Roarke&quot;, Roarke stated that Julie was his god-daughter. The producers dismissed Villechaize from the series before the 1983–1984 season, which ended up being its last, and Tattoo was replaced by a more sedate butler type named Lawrence, played by Christopher Hewett, who pressed an electronic button to ring the bell rather than climb the tower.
A Grumman Widgeon aircraft was used for the series. Just prior to the guests alighting from the plane, Mr. Roarke would address his assembling employees with the phrase &quot;Smiles, everyone! Smiles!&quot; As each visitor disembarked, Roarke would describe to Tattoo (or another assistant) the nature of their fantasy, usually with a cryptic comment, suggesting the person&#x27;s fantasy will not turn out as they expected. Roarke would then welcome his guests by lifting his glass and saying: &quot;My dear guests, I am Mr. Roarke, your host. Welcome to Fantasy Island.&quot; This toast was usually followed with a warm smile, but sometimes — depending on the nature of a guest or their fantasy — his eyes would show concern or worry for a guest&#x27;s safety.

Mr. Roarke&#x27;s actual age is never made clear. In the pilot film, he comments how the guests who come to his island are &quot;so mortal&quot; and there are hints throughout the series that suggest Roarke may be immortal. In &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, a woman from Roarke&#x27;s past appears, but it is revealed that she died over 300 years ago. Other episodes suggest that he was friends with Helen of Troy and Cleopatra. Roarke is also shown to know many seemingly immortal beings over his time on Earth, including ghosts (&quot;The Ghost&#x27;s Story&quot;), a genie (&quot;A Genie Named Joe&quot;), the mermaid Princess Nyah (&quot;The Mermaid&quot;, &quot;The Mermaid Returns&quot;, &quot;The Mermaid and the Matchmaker&quot;), the goddess Aphrodite (&quot;Aphrodite&quot;), and Uriel the Angel of Death (&quot;The Angel&#x27;s Triangle&quot;). In &quot;The Devil and Mandy Breem&quot; and &quot;The Devil and Mr. Roarke&quot;, Roarke even faces the devil (played by Roddy McDowall) who has come to the island to challenge him for either a guest&#x27;s immortal soul or his. It is mentioned this is not the first time that they have confronted each other and Mr. Roarke has always been the winner. In the second story, the devil was one of the island&#x27;s guests, claiming that he was only there to relax and had no interest in Roarke&#x27;s soul at the time. However, this turned out to be yet another ruse.

Roarke had a strong moral code, and he was always merciful. He usually tried to teach his guests important life lessons through the medium of their fantasies, frequently in a manner that exposes the errors of their ways, and on occasions when the island hosted terminally ill guests he would allow them to live out one last wish. Roarke&#x27;s fantasies were not without peril, but the greatest danger usually came from the guests themselves. In some cases, people were killed due to their own negligence, aggression or arrogance. When necessary, Roarke would directly intervene when the fantasy became dangerous to the guest:

* In one episode when Tattoo was given his own fantasy as a birthday gift, which ended up with him being chased by hostile natives in canoes, Mr. Roarke suddenly appeared in a motorboat, snared Tattoo&#x27;s canoe with a grappling hook and towed it away at high speed to help him escape.
* In the 1979 episode &quot;The Mermaid; The Victim&quot;, a female guest seeking to fall in love with her dream man ends up as one of his sex slaves. When she and her fellow slaves manage to get free, they are saved by Mr. Roarke and Tattoo who have arrived with the police who then arrest the two men responsible.
* In the 1980 episode &quot;With Affection, Jack the Ripper; Gigolo&quot;, a female guest intent on researching Jack the Ripper&#x27;s crimes was sent back in time to 1888 London, and would have become one of the Ripper&#x27;s victims had Mr. Roarke not physically intervened.

With only a few exceptions, Roarke always made it quite clear that he was powerless to stop a fantasy once it had begun and that the guests must play them out to their conclusion.

In later seasons, there were often supernatural overtones. Roarke also seemed to have his own supernatural powers of some sort (called the &quot;Gift of the McNabs&quot; in &quot;Delphine&quot;), although it was never explained how this came to be. In the episodes &quot;Reprisal&quot; and &quot;The Power&quot; he temporarily gave the guest psychokinetic abilities and in &quot;Terrors of the Mind&quot; the power to see into the future. In one episode, when a guest says &quot;Thank God things worked out well&quot;, Roarke and Tattoo share an odd look and Roarke says in a cryptic way &quot;Thank God, indeed.&quot; In the same episode, Roarke uses some mysterious powers to help Tattoo with his magic act. Ricardo Montalbán would claim in interviews that he had a definite opinion in mind regarding the mystery of Mr. Roarke, and how he accomplished his fantasies, but he would never publicly state what it was. Years after the series was off the air, in an interview with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, Montalbán finally revealed that his motivation was imagining Roarke as a fallen angel whose sin was pride and that Fantasy Island was Purgatory.

Each episode would alternate between two or three independent storylines as the guests experienced their fantasies and interacted with Roarke. When reruns of the series went into syndication, a half-hour version was offered, in which each hour-long original show was split to two separate half-hour shows in which only one guest&#x27;s story was told in each half-hour episode. This made it obvious that the original episodes had been planned in such a way that each guest or family got off the plane separately, did not interact with the other guest or family, and was given almost exactly half the time of the original episode.

The typical episodes on the series&#x27; regular timeslot focus on adult guests with fantasies geared for them. However, there were two episodes aired in Season 2 that were broadcast on early Sunday night called, &quot;Fantasy Island Sunday Special&quot;. In these variant episodes, kids arrive at the island on a hot-air balloon to have fantasies provided by Mr. Roarke that are designed for their age.

Often the fantasies would turn out to be morality lessons for the guests, sometimes to the point of (apparently) putting their lives at risk, only to have Roarke step in at the last minute and reveal the deception. For example, one episode featured a couple who clamored for the &quot;good old days&quot; being taken back to the Salem witch trials. It is mentioned a few times that a condition of visiting Fantasy Island is that guests never reveal what goes on there. A small number of guests decided to make the irrevocable choice to stay permanently, living out their fantasy until death; one such person was an actor who had been in a Tarzan-type television series called &quot;Jungle Man&quot; in the 1960s. Aside from a clip show (&quot;Remember...When?&quot;) the only episode with a single storyline was &quot;The Wedding&quot;, in which terminally ill Helena Marsh (Samantha Eggar) returned to Fantasy Island to spend her last days as Roarke&#x27;s wife.

Another episode, &quot;Nurses&#x27; Night Out&quot; (from the show&#x27;s seventh season) was the only episode where all of the fantasies, while separate, were linked by one thread. In this case, a mysterious and wealthy guest (Peter Graves) inviting three nurses to live out each of their fantasies on the island.

=== The fantasy ===
==== Cost ====
In the first film, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (1977), it was noted that each guest had paid $50,000 (about $ in dollars) in advance for the fulfillment of their fantasies and that Fantasy Island was a business. In the second film, &quot;Return to Fantasy Island&quot; (1978), Roarke told Tattoo that he sometimes dropped the price when a guest could not afford the usual fee because he believed that everyone should be given a chance to have their fantasies fulfilled. Afterwards, it became clear that the price a guest paid was substantial to him or her, and for one little girl whose father was one of Roarke&#x27;s guests, she had emptied her piggy bank (which contained less than $10) to have her fantasy with her father fulfilled. On numerous occasions, a guest had not paid for the trip at all, but instead won it as a result of a contest. Those who came by winning contests were usually the unknowing beneficiaries of rigged contests in order to disguise to them and others the real reason for their coming as part of someone else&#x27;s fantasy.

==== Nature ====
The nature of a fantasy varied from story to story and was typically very personal to each guest on some level. They could be as harmless as wanting to be reunited with a lost love to something more dangerous like tracking down a cold-blooded killer who murdered someone close to the guest. Usually, the fantasy would take an unexpected turn and proceed down a quite different path than the guest expected. Some resolve in &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot; style. He or she would then leave with some new revelation or renewed interest about themselves or someone close to them. Many times, Roarke would reveal in the end that someone they met during the course of their fantasy was another guest living a fantasy of their own. Both guests often left the island together. However, in one episode, one guest had no particular fantasy and was simply there to relax and enjoy himself. In another episode, the fantasy of one guest (played by Don Knotts) was to play the part of a private investigator. At the end of the episode, he discovers that his &quot;suspects&quot; were actually a company of actors who had asked Mr. Roarke to act out their whodunnit play in a realistic setting.

Although some fantasies were rooted in the real world, many others involved supernatural (such as ghosts, demons, or witchcraft) or mythological (mermaids, genies, goddesses) elements. Time travel was often a required element, if not a specific request, to fulfill one&#x27;s fantasy.

==== Risk ====
Roarke often preceded particularly risky fantasies with a stern warning, a word of caution, or even a suggestion that the guest select another fantasy, instead. He would then inform his guests that he was powerless to stop a fantasy once it had begun and that they must allow the fantasy to play out until its ultimate conclusion. Despite this, on rare occasions, Roarke would appear halfway through a fantasy to offer a guest one more opportunity to terminate his/her fantasy, warning that continuing the current fantasy might lead to serious consequences, possibly even death. However, at that point, the guest would decide on their own to see the fantasy to its end, either for selfless reasons (regarding someone he/she had met during the fantasy) or naïveté of what is in store for them. In the most serious cases, however, Roarke would invariably intervene and ensure his guests&#x27; safety.

Occasionally, some of the fantasies would take place on adjoining islands or parts of Fantasy Island that, according to Roarke, he had no jurisdiction over, thereby heightening the risk factor for the guests. Even then, when Roarke intervened in these cases, he often revealed that he had close connections with the local officials or prominent figures on those islands, who would grant him permission to rescue his guests.

== Production notes ==

Executive producer Aaron Spelling admitted the original pitch was a joke. Spelling said he and production partner Leonard Goldberg were pitching ideas to ABC executive Brandon Stoddard. After the executive rejected all of their plans, at least six in all, Spelling blurted out: &quot;What do you want? An island that people can go to and all of their sexual fantasies will be realized?&quot; Stoddard loved the idea.

The network wanted Orson Welles for Mr. Roarke, but Spelling rejected him, knowing of his irritable nature on sets. He also rejected the idea of a sexy female sidekick to join Roarke and Tattoo.

The show was broadcast every Saturday night on ABC at 10:00 p.m., after &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, which was also produced by Aaron Spelling. Like several other series of the era, such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; employed many celebrity guest stars, often bringing them back repeatedly for different roles.

=== Filming locations ===
The series was filmed primarily in Burbank, California, with the opening scenes of the enchanting island coastline being that of Kauai, Hawaii (both the Na Pali coast as well as Wailua Falls). The house with the bell tower, where Tattoo rings the bell, is the Queen Anne Cottage, located in the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden in Arcadia. The plane, &quot;arriving&quot; with the guests, was filmed in the lagoon behind the Queen Anne Cottage. Sometimes, outdoor scenes were filmed at the Arboretum.

Interior sets were filmed on Stages 26 and 17 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. At some point, the production of exterior scenes moved to the Warner Ranch a short distance away from Warner&#x27;s main lot. B-roll was taken from the Coco Palms Resort in Kauai.

=== Music ===
The &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; theme music was composed by Laurence Rosenthal.

== Other projects ==
=== 1998 revival series ===

In 1998, ABC revived the series in a Saturday time slot. The role of Mr. Roarke was played by Malcolm McDowell in the revival, and in contrast to the first series the supernatural aspect of his character and of Fantasy Island itself was emphasized from the start, along with a dose of dark humor. Director Barry Sonnenfeld, known for his work on &quot;The Addams Family&quot; movies, was a chief creative force on the new series. Another difference was that the new series was filmed in Hawaii instead of California. The remake followed the fantasies of at least two of Roarke&#x27;s guests with an additional subplot involving members of his staff — usually Cal and Harry. Whereas the original series featured a separate writer and title for each subplot, the new series was written as several stories, but featuring a unified theme and title.

=== 2020 horror prequel film adaptation===

A horror-themed prequel film adaptation of the television series starring Michael Peña as Mr. Roarke was released by Sony Pictures and produced by Blumhouse Productions. Director and screenwriter Jeff Wadlow directed the adaptation from a script by Wadlow, Chris Roach, and Jillian Jacobs. The film was released on February 14, 2020, to overwhelmingly negative reviews.

=== 2021 Fox sequel series ===

A series was greenlit in December 2020 as a sequel to and maintains continuity with the original 1977 series, slated for a mid 2021 release on Fox. The series was a co-production between Sony Pictures Television and Fox Entertainment. In April 2021, it was announced that Kiara Barnes and John Gabriel Rodriguez were cast, as part of the main cast of the series. That same month, it was announced that Roselyn Sánchez joined the cast of the series as Elena Roarke, a descendant of Mr. Roarke. The series premiered on August 10, 2021 and aired for two seasons.

== Syndication ==
Selected episodes from the first, second and third seasons are available free at Hulu. Selected Minisodes from seasons one, three, four, five, and six are available free at Sony Crackle, along with complete episodes from seasons one, two, and three.

Digital multicast television network Cozi TV announced the series would be airing on the network beginning fall 2013. Episodes of the original series were seen on Fridays on sister cable network Universal HD, until July 2017, when the network changed to the Olympic Channel.

In Canada, the entire series with all seven seasons is available for streaming on the CTV App, with the first five seasons remastered in High Definition, the first three seasons have been enhanced to 1.78:1 aspect ratio.

In May 2021, it was added to the streaming service Tubi, with all seven seasons.

In August 2021, it started airing on digital multicast television network getTV on Saturday and Sunday nights (4:00 AM ET).

== Home media ==
In 1988, Star Classics released the pilot episode of the series on VHS in the United States and Canada.

In 2005, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released season one of the original series on DVD in regions 1, 2 &amp; 4. The release included the 1977 pilot &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Return to Fantasy Island&quot;. However, due to poor sales, no further seasons were released.

In February 2012, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1; they subsequently released the second season on DVD on May 8, 2012. Season 3 was released on October 23, 2012.

In 2013, Mill Creek Entertainment announced they had obtained the rights to re-release the previous season sets of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; on DVD.

<text>Polish members of the Catholic Church, like elsewhere in the world, are under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The Latin Church includes 41 dioceses. There are three eparchies of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the country, with members of the Armenian Catholic Church under the Ordinariate for Eastern Catholics in Poland. The oridnaries of these jurisdictions comprise the Episcopal Conference of Poland. Combined, these comprise about 10,000 parishes and religious orders. There are 40.55 million registered Catholics (the data includes the number of infants baptized) in Poland. The primate of the Church is Wojciech Polak, Archbishop of Gniezno. In the early 2000s, 99% of all children born in Poland were baptized Catholic. In 2015, the church recorded that 97.7% of Poland&#x27;s population was Catholic. Other statistics suggested this proportion of adherents to Catholicism could be as low as 85%. The rate of decline has been described as &quot;devastating&quot; the former social prestige and political influence that the Catholic Church in Poland once enjoyed. On the other hand, a 2023 survey of 36 countries with large Catholic populations using data from the World Values Survey revealed that 52% of Polish Catholics claimed to attend Mass weekly, the seventh highest of the nations surveyed and the highest among European countries. Most Poles adhere to Roman Catholicism. About 71.3% of the population identified themselves as such in the 2021 census, down from 88% in 2011.

==History==

Ever since Poland officially adopted Christianity in 966, the Catholic Church has played an important religious, cultural and political role in the country post-schism. Identifying oneself as Catholic distinguished Polish culture and nationality from neighbouring Germany, especially eastern and northern Germany, which is mostly Lutheran, and the countries to the east which are Eastern Orthodox. During times of foreign oppression, the Catholic Church was a cultural guard in the fight for independence and national survival. For instance, the Polish abbey in Częstochowa, which successfully resisted a siege in the Swedish invasion of Poland in the 17th century, became a symbol of national resistance to the occupation. The establishment of a communist regime controlled by the Soviet Union following World War II allowed the Church to continue fulfilling this role, although recent allegations suggest there was some minor collaboration between Polish clergy and the regime.

The 1978 election of Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II strengthened the ties of identification. John Paul&#x27;s visits to Poland became rallying points for the faithful and galvanized opposition to the Soviet regime. His beatification in 2011 and canonization 3 years later further instilled pride and joy in the Polish people. In 2013, Pope Francis, John Paul II&#x27;s 2nd successor (and who was made a cardinal by the Polish pope), announced that World Youth Day, the world&#x27;s largest religious gathering of young people, would be held in Kraków, Poland in 2016.

In 2013 a succession of child sex abuse scandals within the Church, and the poor response by the Church, became a matter of some public concern. The church resisted demands to pay compensation to victims.

==Number of Catholics in Poland==

As of 2023, a majority of Poles, approximately 71%, identified themselves as Catholic, and 58% said they are active practicing Catholics, according to a survey by the Centre for Public Opinion Research. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland, 95% of Poles belong to the Catholic Church; this survey bases the number of adherents on the number of infants baptized, as provided by the Catholic Church. The CIA Factbook gives a number of 87.2% belonging to the Catholic Church in 2012.
In the biggest part of Europe, the rates of religious observance have steadily decreased. However, Poland still remains one of the most devoutly religious countries in Europe. Polish Catholics participate in the sacraments more frequently than their counterparts in most Western European and North American countries. A 2023 study by the Church itself revealed that 98.5% of Poles go to confession at least once a year, while 97% of the respondents say they do so more often than once a year. By contrast, a 2005 study by Georgetown University&#x27;s Center for Applied Research on the Apostolate revealed that only 14% of American Catholics take part in the sacrament of penance once a year, with a mere 2% doing so more frequently. Tarnów is the most religious city in Poland, and Łódź is the least. The southern and eastern parts of Poland are more active in their religious practices than those of the West and North. The majority of Poles continue to declare themselves Catholic. This is in stark contrast to the otherwise similar neighboring Czech Republic, which is one of the least religious practicing areas on Earth, with only 35% declaring &quot;they believe there is a God&quot; of any kind.

A 2014 report by &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; found that the proportion of Polish Catholics attending Sunday Mass was approximately 39.1%. At the same time, however, this partly results from the fact that since 2004 2.1 million Poles have emigrated to Western Europe. Writing for the Catholic weekly Tygodnik Powszechny, Church sociologist Rev. Prof. Janusz Mariański has noted that these two million Polish emigrants are still listed in their parish records as members, so when Mass attendance is measured such emigres lower the official records. The proportion of Mass attendees receiving Holy Communion is rising, while the number of Polish Catholic priests continues to rise as ordinations outpace deaths in Poland, though the number of nuns is decreasing.

=== Religious practice ===

The Centre for Public Opinion Research regularly conducts surveys on religious practice in Poland. A 2012 document reported that for more than a quarter-century church attendance and declarations of religious faith have been stable, decreasing only minimally since 2005 when the grief related to the death of Pope John Paul II led to an increase in religious practice among Poles. In a 2012 study, 52% of Poles declared that they attend religious services at least once a week, 38% do so once or twice a month, and 11% do so never or almost never. Meanwhile, 94% of Poles consider themselves to be religious believers (9% of whom consider themselves &quot;deeply religious&quot;), while only 6% of Poles claim that they are non-believers. According to the Church&#x27;s own sources, 36.3% of Catholics required to attend the Sunday Mass, take part in it.

Easter continues to be an important holiday for Polish Catholics. According to a 2012 study by the CBOS (Centre for Public Opinion Research), 74% of Poles make an effort to participate in the sacrament of penance before Easter, 59% make an effort to attend the Stations of the Cross or Gorzkie żale (an increase of 6% since 2003), 57% want to improve themselves for the better (an increase of 7%), 49% want to help the needy (an increase of 8%), and 46% want to pray more .

A CBOS opinion poll from April 2014 found the following:


===Apostasy===

During the October 2020 Polish protests, enquiries regarding the procedure for apostasy from the Polish Catholic Church became popular. Web search engine queries showed high frequencies for &quot;apostasy&quot; () and &quot;how to do apostasy&quot; (), and a Facebook event titled &quot;Quit the church at Christmas&quot; was followed by 5000 people.

, the formal apostasy procedure in the Polish Catholic Church is a procedure defined on 7 October 2015 by the Episcopal Conference of Poland, which became effective as of 19 February 2016. It can only be done in person, by delivering an application to a church parish priest. The procedure cannot be done by email, post, or state administrative services.

<doc id="453058" wikidata="Q4384581" url="?curid=453058" title="District of Louisiana">
<text>The District of Louisiana, or Louisiana District, was an official and temporary United States government designation for the portion of the Louisiana Purchase that had not been organized into the Territory of Orleans or &quot;Orleans Territory&quot; (the portion of the Louisiana Purchase south of the 33rd parallel, which is now the Arkansas–Louisiana state line). The district officially existed from March 10, 1804, until July 4, 1805, when it was organized as the Louisiana Territory.

The area north of present-day Arkansas was commonly referred to as [[Illinois Country|Upper Louisiana]]. The United States District of Louisiana had two incarnations: first, as a federally administered military district (March 10, 1804 - September 30, 1804); then as an organized territory (October 1, 1804 – July 4, 1805) under the jurisdiction of the Indiana Territory.

A similarly named &quot;Louisiana District&quot; had also previously been an administrative division under Spanish and French rule.

==Military district of Louisiana (1804)==
In legislation enacted October 31, 1803, Congress made provisions for a temporary government of the territory purchased from France. The president was authorized to use military forces to maintain order, although the local civil government was to continue as it had under French and Spanish rule.

This military rule was in effect from March 10, 1804 —the official date of transfer from French hands (known as Three Flags Day) —until September 30, 1804. At this time, the district was further divided into five administrative divisions or districts: New Madrid, Cape Girardeau, Ste. Genevieve, St. Charles, and St. Louis.

Amos Stoddard served during this time as district commandant.

==Civilian district of Louisiana (1804–1805)==
On March 26, 1804, Congress enacted legislation effective October 1, 1804, that extended the authority of the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory to provide temporary jurisdiction over the District of Louisiana.

Later that year, Indiana territorial governor William Henry Harrison and territorial judges Davis, Griffin, and Vandenberg held court in the district capital of St. Louis and enacted laws for the region.

On July 4, 1805, the District of Louisiana was re-designated as the Louisiana Territory (1805–1812), when it acquired its own territorial government, modeled on that of the Indiana Territory.

==Inhabitants&#x27; concerns==
Under the terms of the act establishing the temporary government, the governor and judges of the Indiana Territory were to meet twice a year in St. Louis. However, the settlers west of the Mississippi River complained strongly about the arrangement. Opposition was indicated by:

*Protests of policies not recognizing the previous Spanish land grants (including property belonging to Daniel Boone);
*Objections to policies evicting settlers from land in anticipation of areas to be given to American Indians —who were to be relocated west of the Mississippi River;
*Disapproval over the implementation of common law when the land had been governed previously by civil law;
*Arguments over the introduction of new taxes;
*Dissatisfaction over the lack of provisions for schooling the French-speaking majority;
*Heated debate over fears that Northwest Ordinance provisions prohibiting slave ownership would be implemented in areas where slavery had historically been allowed;
*Concerns that the Indiana territorial capital, Vincennes, was more than 180 miles away from district capital, St. Louis.

Upset citizens of the Louisiana District met in St. Louis in September 1804 to sign a declaration formally protesting the annexation. Among the signers were Auguste Chouteau.

A notable event during this period was the signing of the Treaty of St. Louis, in which the Sac and Fox Indian tribes ceded northeastern Missouri, northern Illinois, and southern Wisconsin to the United States. Resentment over this treaty was to cause the tribes to side with the British during the War of 1812 in raids along the Missouri, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers and was to spur the Black Hawk War in 1832.

On March 3, 1805, Congress enacted legislation organizing the District of Louisiana into the Louisiana Territory, effective July 4, 1805. The territorial government was organized similarly to that of the Indiana Territory.

<doc id="453059" wikidata="Q5159133" url="?curid=453059" title="Condado (Santurce)">
<text>Condado (Spanish for &quot;county&quot;) is an urbanized, beachfront resort, commercial, and residential district with various upscale hotels, restaurants, boutique shops, and condos in the barrio of Santurce in San Juan, the capital municipality of Puerto Rico, about from the Old San Juan historic quarter, Isla Verde resort area, Hato Rey business center, and SJU airport. Named after Count Pablo Ubarri, who built the first passenger steam tramway in the main island through Santurce between Old San Juan and the Río Piedras district in 1880, Condado is centered around Ashford Avenue, which extends east-west for about from the Parque residential area to San Juan Islet, where Old San Juan is located.

Vacant until the turn of the 20th century, the real estate development of Condado began with the construction of the Ashford Presbyterian Community Hospital in 1904 by Grace Williams Atkins, &quot;Casa Mora&quot; (Moor House) in 1909 and Dos Hermanos Bridge in 1910 by Hernand and Sosthenes Behn, &quot;Condado&quot; passenger electric tramway in 1911 by Porto Rico Railway, Light &amp; Power Co. (PRRL&amp;P), and Vanderbilt Hotel in 1919 by Frederick Vanderbilt .
==Setting==
Condado is an upscale neighborhood located on the beach. It is located east of the historic district of Old San Juan, which is situated on San Juan Islet. It is one of 40 subbarrios of Santurce. The land area measures with a resident population of 6,170 according to the 2000 United States Census.

The eastern border is marked by De Diego Avenue and its straight extension towards the Atlantic coast. On the south, the subbarrio is bounded by Wilson Street, Aldea Street, Expreso Baldorioty de Castro, Piccioni Street and Delcasse Street, and by the Condado Lagoon (from east to west). At the westernmost point is the Dos Hermanos Bridge, where Ashford Avenue ends and leads into Old San Juan. In the north are the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean next to hotels and other attractions such as nightclubs, casinos, shops and restaurants. Condado is one of the island&#x27;s primary tourist destinations.

In recent years, El Condado neighborhood has become associated with wealth and status. Properties are scarce, hard to come by and extremely expensive. It is sometimes called the “Manhattan of Puerto Rico” and properties tend to hover in the millions of dollars. It is one of the most desirable places to live on the island and as such commands a premium.

===20th century===

Condado began its process of urbanization in 1908 by two American industrialists, Hernan and Sosthenes, also known as the Behn Brothers. The quarter became a typical streetcar suburb to the traditional urban center of Old San Juan. Its growth and development was mostly shaped by a transportation influenced suburbanization developed on a grid plan.

The neighborhood experienced an economic boom in the first decades of the 20th century when some of the wealthiest families built their homes in the area. The Vanderbilts built a summer home in 1919 which today has been converted into the luxurious Condado Vanderbilt Hotel. The Behn Brothers also built their home in Condado and to their memory, Dos Hermanos Bridge (or &quot;Two Brothers Bridge&quot; in English) is named in their honor as founders of Puerto Rico Telephone and the new electric tramway line that linked &quot;the county&quot; to Old San Juan.

The 1950s-60s era saw another boom in Condado, with the rapid industrialization of Puerto Rico, this flamboyant locale was becoming a popular tourist destination. Large hotels like the Caribe Hilton Hotel and La Concha Resort were built as part of a government sponsorship program under the Operation Bootstrap brand.

A convention center was built to host activities while many families began to move in during the development of high-end and high-rise apartment buildings. In fact, Ashford Avenue was named after another well-known &quot;Condado&quot; resident Dr. Bailey Ashford. It runs through the subbarrio and leads toward the Puente Dos Hermanos.

==Demographics==
In 2010, Condado had a population of 4,908 and a population density of 15,832.3 persons per square mile.
===21st century===

Condado looks quite different from what it did at the turn of the century. Some of the luxurious homes which still remain nestled between the high-rise condominiums have been converted into small inns, shops, museums or restaurants. Dr. Bailey Ashford&#x27;s home has been remodeled and there are plans to turn it into a museum. Condado&#x27;s main public space is La Ventana al Mar, designed by architect and urbanist Andrés Mignucci. The park is flanked by two of Condado&#x27;s landmark hotels: to the west by the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel (1919), designed by Warren and Whitmore, and to the east by the La Concha Hotel (1957), designed by Toro Ferrer.

One of the first schools constructed by the United States is in Condado. Designed by Antonin Nechodoma, it was designated as a historic site in November 2020 by the Puerto Rico Planning Board.

===Public transportation===
Condado is served by the Puerto Rico Metropolitan Bus Authority with two bus routes: T21 and D53.

<doc id="453066" wikidata="Q622284" url="?curid=453066" title="The Apu Trilogy">
<text>The Apu Trilogy comprises three Indian Bengali-language drama films directed by Satyajit Ray: &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; (1955), &quot;Aparajito&quot; (1956) and &quot;The World of Apu&quot; (1959). The original music for the films was composed by Ravi Shankar.

The films are based on two Bengali novels written by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay: &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; (1929) and &quot;Aparajito&quot; (1932). The three films went on to win many national and international awards, including three National Film Awards and seven awards from the Cannes, Berlin and Venice Film Festivals. The films were produced on a shoestring budget (&quot;Pather Panchali&quot; had a budget of roughly 150,000 ($45,300—) using an amateur cast and crew.

==Plot summaries==
The three films comprise a &quot;coming of age&quot; narrative in the vein of a &quot;bildungsroman&quot;; they describe the childhood, education and early maturity of a young Bengali named Apu (Apurba Kumar Roy) in the early part of the 20th century.

Pather Panchali (English, &quot;Song of the Little Road&quot;)
Apu&#x27;s early experiences in rural Bengal as the son of a poor but high caste family are presented. Apu&#x27;s father Harihar, a Brahmin, has difficulty in supporting his family. After the death of Apu&#x27;s sister, Durga, the family moves to the holy city of Benares.

Aparajito (English, &quot;The Unvanquished&quot;)
The family&#x27;s finances are still precarious. After his father dies there, Apu and his mother Sarbajaya come back to a village in Bengal. Despite unrelenting poverty, Apu manages to get formal schooling and turns out to be a brilliant student. He moves to Calcutta to pursue his education. He slowly distanced himself from his rural roots and his mother who was not keeping well at the time. In the process the growing Apu comes into conflict with his mother. Later he is informed that, when his mother dies too, he has to learn to live alone.

Apur Sansar (English, &quot;The World of Apu&quot;)
Attempting to become a writer, Apu unexpectedly finds himself pressured to marry a girl whose mother rejected her mentally ill bridegroom on the day of their wedding. Their blossoming marriage ends in her death in childbirth, after which the despairing Apu abandons his child, but eventually returns to accept his responsibilities.

==Production==
In 1950, Ray had decided that &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;, the classic coming of age story (bildungsroman) of Bengali literature, published in 1928 by Bibhutibhusan Bandopadhyay, would be the subject matter for his first film. This semi-autobiographical novel describes the growing up of Apu, a small boy in a Bengal village. He went ahead with the film after meeting Jean Renoir during filming of &quot;The River&quot; (1951) and after watching the Italian neorealist film &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948) while he was in London. Besides the influence of European cinema and Bengali literature, Ray is also indebted to the Indian theatrical tradition, particularly the &quot;rasa&quot; theory of classical Sanskrit drama. The complicated doctrine of &quot;rasa&quot; centers predominantly on feelings experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator. The duality of &quot;rasa&quot; representation shows in &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;.

Ray gathered an inexperienced crew, although both his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta went on to achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur artists. Shooting started in late 1952, using Ray&#x27;s personal savings. He had hoped that once the initial shots had been completed, he would be able to obtain funds to support the project, but such funding was not forthcoming. &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; was shot over the unusually long period of three years, because shooting was possible only from time to time, when Ray or production manager Anil Chowdhury could arrange further money. With a loan from the West Bengal government, the film was finally completed and released in 1955 to great critical and popular success, sweeping up numerous prizes and having long runs in both India and abroad. During the making of the film, Ray refused funding from sources who demanded a change in script or the supervision of the producer, and he ignored advice from the government (which finally funded the film anyway) to incorporate a happy ending in having Apu&#x27;s family join a &quot;development project&quot;. Even greater help than Renoir&#x27;s encouragement occurred when Ray showed a sequence to John Huston who was in India scouting locations for &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot;. The sequence is the remarkable vision Apu and his sister have of the train running through the countryside. It was the only sequence Ray had filmed due to his small budget. Huston praised Ray to Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art, saying that a major talent was on the horizon.

In India, the reaction to the film was enthusiastic; &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote that &quot;it is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema [...]. &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; is pure cinema&quot;. In the United Kingdom, Lindsay Anderson wrote a glowing review of the film. However, the reaction was not uniformly positive. After watching the film, François Truffaut is reported to have said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands&quot;. Bosley Crowther, then the most influential critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote a mixed review of the film that its distributor Ed Harrison thought would kill off the film when it got released in the United States, but it enjoyed an exceptionally long run.

Ray&#x27;s international career started in earnest after the success of his next film, &quot;Aparajito&quot; (&quot;The Unvanquished&quot;). This film shows the eternal struggle between the ambitions of Apu as a young man and the mother who loves him. Some critics, notably Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak, rank it even higher than the first film. Aparajito won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. The film is also notable for its application of bounce lighting to recreate the effect of daylight on sets with the use of large scale diffusers, pioneered by the cinematographer Subrata Mitra.

Ray had not thought about a trilogy while making &quot;Aparajito&quot;, and it occurred to him only after being asked about the idea in Venice. The final installation of the series, &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (&quot;The World of Apu&quot;), was made in 1959. A number of critics find this to be the supreme achievement of the trilogy (Robin Wood, Aparna Sen). Ray introduced two of his favourite actors, Soumitra Chatterjee and Sharmila Tagore, in this film. The film finds Apu living in a nondescript Kolkata house in near-poverty. He becomes involved in an unusual marriage with Aparna, the scenes of their life together forming &quot;one of the cinema&#x27;s classic affirmative depiction of married life&quot;, but tragedy ensues. After &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; was harshly criticised by a Bengali critic, Ray wrote an article defending it—a rare event in Ray&#x27;s filmmaking career (the other major instance involved the film &quot;Charulata&quot;, Ray&#x27;s personal favourite). His success had little influence on his personal life in the years to come. Ray continued to live with his mother, uncle and other members of his extended family in a rented house.

==Cast and characters==
==Critical reception==
This trilogy is considered by critics around the globe to rank among the greatest achievements of Indian film, and it is established as one of the most historically important cinematic debuts. &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; won at least thirteen international prizes (including Best Human Document at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival), followed by eleven international prizes for &quot;Aparajito&quot; (including the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival) and numerous other awards for &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (including the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival). When Ray made &quot;Pather Panchali&quot;, he worked with a cast and crew most of whom had never been previously involved in film. Ray himself at the time of directing &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; had primarily worked in the advertising industry, although he had served as assistant director on Jean Renoir&#x27;s 1951 film &quot;The River&quot;. From this foundation, Ray went on to create other highly acclaimed films, like &quot;Charulata&quot;, &quot;Mahanagar&quot;, and &quot;Aranyer Din Ratri&quot;, and his international success energised other Bengal filmmakers like Mrinal Sen and Ritwik Ghatak.
This extract from &quot;Youth&quot;, by South African author J. M. Coetzee, talks of the music in the &quot;Apu trilogy&quot;, which is based on Indian classical music:

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; has a 98% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 82 reviews and in 2009 was included in its list of top 100 foreign films. &quot;Aparajito&quot; has a 96% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 25 reviews, and &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (&quot;The World of Apu&quot;) has a 97% fresh rating based on an aggregate of 29 reviews. This makes &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; one of the highest-rated film trilogies of all time (97%, 94%, 100%), along with the &quot;Toy Story&quot; trilogy (100%, 100%, 99%), &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (91%, 96%, 93%), the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy (94%, 97%, 83%), and the &quot;Before&quot; trilogy (100%, 95%, 98%).

Film critic Roger Ebert, when including the films in his Great Movies list, wrote about the trilogy: 

==Theme==
Andre Robinson, in his book &quot;Satyajit Ray: The Inner Eye&quot;, comments that the three films differ in their predominant moods, and he compares the trilogy to the development of an Indian classical &quot;raga&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;, the British Film Institute&#x27;s film magazine, listed &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; several times in its Critics&#x27; Poll of all-time greatest films, in 1962 (ranked #11), 1982 (ranked #79), 1992 (ranked #6), 2002 (ranked #22), 2012 (ranked #42) and 2022 (ranked #35). &quot;The World of Apu&quot; appeared in 1982, ranked at #42. In the 1992 edition, both &quot;Aparajito&quot; and &quot;The World of Apu&quot; were tied at #127, while &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; was ranked separately at #88. In a combined list of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; critics&#x27; and directors&#x27; poll results in 2002, &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; was ranked at No. 28, &quot;The World of Apu&quot; at No. 93 and &quot;Aparajito&quot; at #160. If the votes are combined, then &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; as a whole would be ranked at No. 14 in 1982, No. 4 in 1992 and No. 14 in 2002. In director&#x27;s poll of &quot;Greatest films of all time&quot; by &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; ranked 48th in 2012 and 22nd in 2022.

In 1988, John Kobal&#x27;s poll of critics and filmmakers ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 35 on their list of Top 100 Movies. In 1998, the Asian film magazine &quot;Cinemaya&quot;&#x27;s critics&#x27; poll of all-time greatest films ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 7 on the list, while &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; alone was ranked at No. 2 on the same list. If the votes are combined, then &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; would be ranked at #1. In 1999, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; at No. 12 (tied with &quot;The Godfather&quot;) in its top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list, based on a poll of critics, while &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; was ranked separately at No. 54 in the same poll. If the votes are combined, &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; would be ranked at #5. In 2000, an audience poll of best Asian films conducted by &quot;MovieMail&quot; ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 2 on the list. In January 2002, the trilogy as a whole was voted at No. 70 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. In 2021 the trilogy was ranked at No. 65 on &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 100 best movies of all time&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; ranked &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; at No. 4 on its list of &quot;10 greatest movie trilogies of all time&quot;.

&quot;Pather Panchali&quot; was included in various other all-time greatest film lists, including &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Centenary Top One Hundred Films&quot; in 1995, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s &quot;Hot 100 Films From the Past&quot; in 1997, the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;100 Maverick Movies of the Last 100 Years&quot; in 1999, and the British Film Institute&#x27;s Top Fifty &quot;Must See&quot; Children&#x27;s Films in 2005. Akira Kurosawa ranked &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; at No. 37 on his &quot;Top 100 favourite films of all time&quot; list. In 1996, &quot;The World of Apu&quot; was included in Movieline Magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Foreign Films&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; and &quot;The World of Apu&quot; featured in &quot;The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; as a whole was included in film critic Roger Ebert&#x27;s list of The Great Movies in 2001 and in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s All-Time 100 best movies list in 2005. It was also ranked No. 17 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. The original trilogy has been reconstructed via the Harvard Film archive &amp; Criterion and was shown in Kendall Square, Cambridge, MA the 1st week of July 2015.

&quot;Apur Panchali&quot; is a Bengali film based on Subir Banerjee&#x27;s life, who played child &quot;Apu&quot; in the first installment of &quot;Apu Trilogy&quot;. Director Kaushik Ganguly won the award of best director for &quot;Apur Panchali&quot; in the 44th International Film Festival of India (IFFI) in November 2013. The director mentioned in an interview that he found similarities between certain parts of the life of Subir Banerjee and the iconic character Apu. In the film actor Parambrata Chatterjee portrays a younger Subir Banerjee, while Ardhendu Bannerjee plays the role of the aged Banerjee.

===Influence===
According to Michael Sragow of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1994:

Across the world, filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, James Ivory, Abbas Kiarostami, Elia Kazan, Carlos Saura, Isao Takahata, Barry Jenkins, Philip Kaufman, Wes Anderson and Danny Boyle have been influenced by &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;, with many others such as Akira Kurosawa praising the work. Filmmaker Martin Scorsese when talking about &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot; remarked &quot;without a doubt, in [Ray&#x27;s] films the line between poetry and cinema, dissolved&quot;. In Gregory Nava&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;My Family&quot;, the final scene is duplicated from the final scene of &quot;Apur Sansar&quot;. Similar influences and references to the trilogy can be found, for example, in recent works such as &quot;Sacred Evil&quot;, Paul Auster&#x27;s 2008 novel &quot;Man in the Dark&quot;, the &quot;Elements trilogy&quot; of Deepa Mehta and even in films of Jean-Luc Godard. The technique of bounce lighting pioneered by Subrata Mitra, to recreate the effect of daylight on sets, has also had a profound influence on the development of cinematography. Ravi Shankar&#x27;s soundtracks to the films were also a major influence on The Beatles, specifically George Harrison.

<doc id="453069" wikidata="Q360317" url="?curid=453069" title="Mackem">
<text>Mackem, Makem or Mak&#x27;em is a nickname for residents of and people from Sunderland, a city in North East England. It is also a name for the local dialect and accent (not to be confused with Geordie); and for a fan, of whatever origin, of Sunderland A.F.C. It has been used by (a proportion of) the people of Sunderland to describe themselves since the 1980s, prior to which it was mainly used in Tyneside as a disparaging exonym. An alternative name for a Mackem (except in the sense of a football supporter) is a Wearsider.

According to the British Library, &quot;Locals insist there are significant differences between Geordie [spoken in Newcastle upon Tyne] and several other local dialects, such as Pitmatic and Mackem. Pitmatic is the dialect of the former mining areas in County Durham and around Ashington to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, while Mackem is used locally to refer to the dialect of the city of Sunderland and the surrounding urban area of Wearside.&quot;

==Etymology==
There is much debate about the origin of the word Mackem, although it has been argued that it may stem from the phrase &quot;Mak ‘em and Tak’em&quot; - with Mak’em being the local pronunciation of &quot;make them&quot; and Tak’em from &quot;take them&quot;.

According to the current entry in the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest occurrence of the word Mackem or Mak’em in print was in 1988. However, as evidenced by the attached news articles, the word Mak’em (or Mackem) has been much in evidence for a great many years prior to 1988. Indeed, one of the articles attached dates to 1929.

It has been argued that the expressions date back to the height of Sunderland&#x27;s shipbuilding history, as the shipwrights would &quot;make&quot; the ships, then the maritime pilots and tugboat captains would &quot;take&quot; them down the River Wear to the sea – the shipyards and port authority being the most conspicuous employers in Sunderland. A variant explanation is that the builders at Sunderland would build the ships, which would then go to Tyneside to be outfitted, hence from the standpoint of someone from Sunderland, &quot;we make &#x27;em an&#x27; they take &#x27;em&quot; – however, this account is disputed (and, indeed, as an earlier form of the name was Mac n&#x27; Tac, it seems unlikely). Another explanation is that ships were both built and repaired (i.e. &quot;taken in for repairs&quot;) on the Wear. The term could also be a reference to the volume of ships built during wartime on the River Wear, e.g. &quot;We make&#x27;em and they sink&#x27;em&quot;.

Whatever the exact origin of the term, Mackem has come to refer to someone from Sunderland and its surrounding areas, in particular the supporters of the local football team Sunderland AFC, and may have been coined in that context. Newcastle and Sunderland have a history of rivalry beyond the football pitch, the rivalry associated with industrial disputes of the 19th century.

Evidence suggests the term is a recent coinage. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the earliest occurrence of it in print was in 1988. The phrase &quot;we still tak&#x27;em and mak&#x27;em&quot; was found in a sporting context in 1973 in reference to Sunderland Cricket &amp; Rugby Football Club. While this lends support to the theory that this phrase was the origin of the term &quot;Mak&#x27;em&quot;, there is nothing to suggest that &quot;mak&#x27;em&quot; had come to be applied to people from Sunderland generally at such a date. The name &quot;Mak&#x27;em&quot; may refer to the Wearside shipyard workers, who during World War II were brought into shipbuilding and regarded as taking work away from the Geordies on Tyneside.

==Characteristics==
There has been very little academic work done on the Sunderland dialect. It was a site in the early research by Alexander John Ellis, who also recorded a local song called &quot;Spottee&quot;. Ellis regarded Sunderland as speaking a variant of the North Durham dialect, which it shared with much of the Durham Coalfield. He considered Sunderland to be situated near a dialectal boundary. The nearby village of Ryhope and a narrow coastal strip running south, which at the time had not yet been incorporated into the coalfield, were placed within the South Durham dialectal region. This region also included the dialects of Weardale and Teesdale. Ellis also noted the influence on Sunderland speech from migrants to the area from Ireland and Scotland. 

In the Survey of English Dialects, the nearby town of Washington was surveyed. The researcher of the site, Stanley Ellis, later worked with police on analysing the speech in a tape sent to the police during the Yorkshire Ripper investigation, which became known as the Wearside Jack tape because the police switched their investigation to Wearside after Ellis&#x27;s analysis of the tape.

To people outside the region, the differences between Mackem and Geordie dialects often seem marginal, but there are many notable differences. A perceptual dialect study by the University of Sunderland found that locals of the region consider Geordie and Mackem to be separate dialects and identify numerous lexical, grammatical, and phonetic differences between the two. In fact, Mackem is considered to be more closely related to Durham dialects than to those of Tyneside. There are even a small but noticeable differences in pronunciation and grammar between the dialects of North and South Sunderland (for example, the word &quot;something&quot; in North Sunderland is often &quot;summik&quot; whereas a South Sunderland speaker may often prefer &quot;summat&quot; and people from the surrounding areas prefer &quot;summit&quot;).

==Phonology==
* &quot;Make&quot; and &quot;take&quot; are pronounced &quot;mak&quot; and &quot;tak&quot; ( and ) in the most conservative forms of the dialect. This variation is the supposed reason why Tyneside shipyard workers might have coined &quot;Mak&#x27;em&quot; as an insult. However, the pronunciation of the word is not confined to Sunderland and can be found in other areas of Northern England and Scotland.
* Many words ending in &quot;-own&quot; are pronounced (cf. Geordie: ).
* &quot;School&quot; is split into two syllables, with a short in between, . This is also the case for words with a vowel preceding , which are monosyllabic in some other dialects, such as &quot;cruel&quot;, &quot;fuel&quot; and &quot;fool&quot;, in Mackem which are , and respectively.
* This &quot;extra syllable&quot; occurs in other words spoken in Mackem dialect, i.e. &quot;film&quot; is . This feature has led to some words being very differently pronounced in Sunderland. The word &quot;face&quot;, due to the inclusion of an extra and the contraction thereof, is often pronounced . While and some other cases of this extra vowel have been observed in the Geordie dialect, 
*&quot;Book&quot; rhymes with &quot;spook&quot; as in Northumberland and on Tyneside, however, there is a difference in vowel quality between Tyneside and Mackem , or .
* The vowel pronounced as in Received Pronunciation, unlike the rhotic Scots variant. Cf. Geordie .
* Most words that have the vowel are pronounced with a short such as &quot;after, laughter, pasta.&quot; However, in the same way as the Geordie dialect, the words &quot;plaster&quot; and &quot;master&quot; are often pronounced with a long . This is not found in most northern accents apart from in the North East.
* The Mackem accent is different from Geordie in some instances. For example, the pronunciation of &quot;curry&quot; is often more like &quot;cerry.&quot; As well as this the use of oo in words with the BROWN vowel isn&#x27;t as frequent as it is in the Geordie accent (Sunderland=town v Newcastle=toon), however, this feature was traditionally found in all dialects north of the Humber-Lune Line. 
*In words such as &quot;green&quot; and &quot;cheese&quot; it has been said that the Sunderland accent has more of a diphthong instead of the standard vowel in most dialects of English.
* H-dropping in words such as &quot;him, her, half&quot; is said to be a feature in Sunderland, Butterknowle, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough, but not in other areas of the North East.
* is traditionally clear in all contexts, meaning the velarised allophone is absent.

==Grammar==
===Definite article===
Unlike some Northern English varieties the definite article is never reduced. As in Scots and other Northumbrian dialects the definite article is used in a wider range of contexts than in standard English, including kinship terms, names of institutions, temporal expressions, illnesses, and even numbers.
===Indefinite Article===
The indefinite article is used with &quot;one&quot; in certain contexts.

===Modal verbs===
Modals can and will as well as the verb de (do) have uncontracted negative forms.
The use of &quot;dinnet&quot; contrasts with Geordie &quot;divvent&quot;.

<text>This list of universities in the Czech Republic includes public, state, private and for-profit universities which exist in the Czech Republic.

==Partial list==

===Old universities===
*Charles University in Prague – founded in 1348 by Bohemian king and Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV.
*Palacký University Olomouc (Olomouc University) – a college founded 1249 by Olomouc bishop, got university rights in 1573 when it was led by the Jesuit Order, in 18th century became state university. During oppressions of absolutism of the 1850s, most faculties were closed, only theological faculty remained. In 1946, other faculties were re-established.
*Czech Technical University in Prague (Bohemian Polytechnica; České vysoké učení technické) – founded in 1707 by Bohemian nobility to provide better technical knowledge. Many important scholars have taught there, e.g. F. J. Gerstner or J. Ressel.
*VSB – Technical University of Ostrava is a polytechnic university with a long history of high-quality engineering education and research was founded on 23 January 1849 in Příbram, moved to Ostrava in 1949.
*Brno University of Technology (BUT) (Vysoké učení technické v Brně, VUT) founded in 1849 as a German-Bohemian Technical College (Německo-české technické učiliště) and transformed into Czech Technical University (České vysoké učení technické) in 1899 with Karel Zahradníček as its first rector. In 1956 transformed into Brno University of Technology (Vysoké učení technické v Brně) and after the Velvet Revolution in 1989 reorganized and new faculties were founded.
*Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (Česká zemědělská univerzita v Praze, ČZU) founded with the charter for the agricultural department at the Czech Technical University in Prague October 1906 by Emperor Franz Josef, following a proposal by Gustav Marchet, Minister for Culture and Education. A government decree was passed in November 1952, establishing an independent University of Agriculture in Prague with the Faculties Agronomy, Economics and Mechanization. In the new millennium the university changed its name to Czech University of Life Sciences Prague (in English) with 5 faculties (Agrobiology, Food &amp; Natural Resources, Economics &amp; Management, Engineering, Environmental Sciences, Forestry, Wildlife &amp; Wood Sciences) and 2 institutes (Tropics &amp; Subtropics, Education &amp; Communication).
*Masaryk University in Brno – founded in 1919 by the state. Became one of the biggest universities during the 1990s.
*Mendel University in Brno (Mendelova univerzita v Brně) – founded in 1919 named after Gregor Mendel, the botanist and the &quot;Father of Genetics&quot;
*Prague University of Economics and Business (Vysoká škola ekonomická v Praze, VŠE) founded in 1919 as Vysoká škola obchodní (the Commercial College) affiliated to Czech Technical University, and currently is the largest university in the field of economics, business and information technologies in the Czech Republic.

===New universities===
After 1989 most of separate faculties in regional cities became standalone universities. They usually bear name of the region. Technology universities in Ostrava, Plzeň and Liberec opened more faculties and branches of study, including humanities, and changed their names.

*University of Pardubice – founded in 1950 as the Chemistry College later for 40 years known as the Institute of Chemical Technology.
*University of West Bohemia – founded in 1990 (continuation of University of Mechanical and Electrotechnical Engineering, est. 1949 under ČVUT, independent 1953).
*University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice – founded in 1991.
*University of Ostrava – founded in 1991 (continuation of Higher School of Education, est. 1953).
*Jan Evangelista Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem – founded in 1991. Purkyně was a biologist, one of the best Bohemian scholars of 19th century.
*University of Silesia, Opava – founded in 1991.
*Technical University of Liberec – founded 1994 (continuation of University of Mechanical and Textile Engineering, est. 1953).
*University of Hradec Králové – founded in 2000 (renamed in 2000, continuation of independent Faculty of Education, est. 1964).
*Tomas Bata University in Zlín – founded in 2001.

===Historical universities===
(Universities that no longer exist)

*&quot;Law University in Prague&quot;: established by separation of Law faculty of Prague University during the 1360s. In long-lasting religious wars in Bohemia (Hussite Wars, after 1420) Law University ended its being.
*&quot;Prague German University&quot;: because of both-sided language chauvinism between Prague Bohemians and Germans, the old Prague University was divided into two Universities of two languages in 1882. Important scholars have taught there, e.g. Albert Einstein, Christian von Ehrenfels or Hans Kelsen. In the 1930s University got slowly under Nazi influence (rector San Niccolo). In 1945, University was closed by government.
*&quot;Russian Free University in Prague&quot;: this University was established in the 1920s and financed by Government of Czechoslovakia to help Russian emigrants who fled before Bolsheviks from their home country. The university was closed by the German occupiers in 1939 and by second time in 1945 by the new leftist government. Many Russian professors and other Russian emigrees, citizens of Czechoslovakia, were kidnapped to Soviet Russia by NKVD in 1945.
*&quot;Ukrainian Free School in Prague&quot;: this university school was established in the 1920s for Ukrainians who fled before Bolsheviks. School followed the end of Russian Free University, many Ukrainian emigres were also kidnapped by NKVD.

<doc id="453078" wikidata="Q660446" url="?curid=453078" title="Gambler's ruin">
<text>In statistics, gambler&#x27;s ruin is the fact that a gambler playing a game with negative expected value will eventually go bankrupt, regardless of their betting system.

The concept was initially stated: A persistent gambler who raises his bet to a fixed fraction of the gambler&#x27;s bankroll after a win, but does not reduce it after a loss, will eventually and inevitably go broke, even if each bet has a positive expected value.

Another statement of the concept is that a persistent gambler with finite wealth, playing a fair game (that is, each bet has expected value of zero to both sides) will eventually and inevitably go broke against an opponent with infinite wealth. Such a situation can be modeled by a random walk on the real number line. In that context, it is probable that the gambler will, with virtual certainty, return to their point of origin, which means going broke, and is ruined an infinite number of times if the random walk continues forever. This is a corollary of a general theorem by Christiaan Huygens, which is also known as gambler&#x27;s ruin. That theorem shows how to compute the probability of each player winning a series of bets that continues until one&#x27;s entire initial stake is lost, given the initial stakes of the two players and the constant probability of winning. This is the oldest &quot;mathematical&quot; idea that goes by the name gambler&#x27;s ruin, but not the first idea to which the name was applied. The term&#x27;s common usage today is another corollary to Huygens&#x27;s result.

The concept has specific relevance for gamblers. However it also leads to mathematical theorems with wide application and many related results in probability and statistics. Huygens&#x27;s result in particular led to important advances in the mathematical theory of probability.

==History==
The earliest known mention of the gambler&#x27;s ruin problem is a letter from Blaise Pascal to Pierre Fermat in 1656 (two years after the more famous correspondence on the problem of points). Pascal&#x27;s version was summarized in a 1656 letter from Pierre de Carcavi to Huygens:
Let two men play with three dice, the first player scoring a point whenever 11 is thrown, and the second whenever 14 is thrown. But instead of the points accumulating in the ordinary way, let a point be added to a player&#x27;s score only if his opponent&#x27;s score is nil, but otherwise let it be subtracted from his opponent&#x27;s score. It is as if opposing points form pairs, and annihilate each other, so that the trailing player always has zero points. The winner is the first to reach twelve points; what are the relative chances of each player winning?

Huygens reformulated the problem and published it in &quot;De ratiociniis in ludo aleae&quot; (&quot;On Reasoning in Games of Chance&quot;, 1657):
Problem (2-1) Each player starts with 12 points, and a successful roll of the three dice for a player (getting an 11 for the first player or a 14 for the second) adds one to that player&#x27;s score and subtracts one from the other player&#x27;s score; the loser of the game is the first to reach zero points. What is the probability of victory for each player? This is the classic gambler&#x27;s ruin formulation: two players begin with fixed stakes, transferring points until one or the other is &quot;ruined&quot; by getting to zero points. However, the term &quot;gambler&#x27;s ruin&quot; was not applied until many years later. 

The gambler&#x27;s ruin problem is often applied to gamblers with finite capital playing against a bookie or casino assumed to have an “infinite” or much larger amount of capital available. It can then be proven that the probability of the gambler&#x27;s eventual ruin tends to 1 even in the scenario where the game is fair or what mathematically is defined as a martingale.

==Reasons for the four results==
Let formula_1 be the amount of money a gambler has at their disposal at any moment, and let formula_2 be any positive integer. Suppose that they raise their stake to formula_3 when they win, but do not reduce their stake when they lose (a not uncommon pattern among real gamblers). Under this betting scheme, it will take at most &quot;N&quot; losing bets in a row to bankrupt them. If their probability of winning each bet is less than 1 (if it is 1, then they are no gambler), they are virtually certain to eventually lose &quot;N&quot; bets in a row, however big &quot;N&quot; is. It is not necessary that they follow the precise rule, just that they increase their bet fast enough as they win. This is true even if the expected value of each bet is positive.

The gambler playing a fair game (with probability formula_4 of winning) will eventually either go broke or double their wealth. By symmetry, they have a formula_4 chance of going broke before doubling their money. If they double their money, they repeat this process and they again have a formula_4 chance of doubling their money before going broke. After the second process, they have a formula_7 chance that they have not gone broke yet. Continuing this way, their chance of not going broke after formula_8 processes is formula_9, which approaches formula_10, and their chance of going broke after formula_8 successive processes is formula_12 which approaches formula_13.

Huygens&#x27;s result is illustrated in the next section.

The eventual fate of a player at a game with negative expected value cannot be better than the player at a fair game, so they will go broke as well.

==Example of Huygens&#x27;s result==

===Fair coin flipping===
Consider a coin-flipping game with two players where each player has a 50% chance of winning with each flip of the coin. After each flip of the coin the loser transfers one penny to the winner. The game ends when one player has all the pennies.

If there are no other limitations on the number of flips, the probability that the game will eventually end this way is 1. (One way to see this is as follows. Any given finite string of heads and tails will eventually be flipped with certainty: the probability of not seeing this string, while high at first, decays exponentially. In particular, the players would eventually flip a string of heads as long as the total number of pennies in play, by which time the game must have already ended.)

If player one has &quot;n&quot;1 pennies and player two &quot;n&quot;2 pennies, the probabilities &quot;P&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;2 that players one and two, respectively, will end penniless are:

formula_14

Two examples of this are if one player has more pennies than the other; and if both players have the same number of pennies.
In the first case say player one formula_15 has 8 pennies and player two (formula_16) were to have 5 pennies then the probability of each losing is:

formula_17

It follows that even with equal odds of winning the player that starts with fewer pennies is more likely to fail.

In the second case where both players have the same number of pennies (in this case 6) the likelihood of each losing is:

formula_18

===Unfair coin flipping===

In the event of an unfair coin, where player one wins each toss with probability p, and player two wins with probability &quot;q&quot; = 1 − &quot;p&quot;, then the probability of each ending penniless is:

formula_19

An argument is that the expected hitting time is finite and so with a martingale, associating the value formula_20 with each state so that the expected value of the state is constant, this is the solution to the system of equations:

formula_21

Alternately, this can be shown as follows: Consider the probability of player 1 experiencing gamblers ruin having started with formula_22 amount of money, formula_23. Then, using the Law of Total Probability, we have

formula_24

where W denotes the event that player 1 wins the first bet. Then clearly formula_25 and formula_26. Also formula_27 is the probability that player 1 experiences gambler&#x27;s ruin having started with formula_28 amount of money: and formula_29 is the probability that player 1 experiences gambler&#x27;s ruin having started with formula_30 amount of money.
Denoting formula_31, we get the linear homogeneous recurrence relation

formula_32

which we can solve using the fact that formula_33 (i.e. the probability of gambler&#x27;s ruin given that player 1 starts with no money is 1), and formula_34 (i.e. the probability of gambler&#x27;s ruin given that player 1 starts with all the money is 0.) For a more detailed description of the method see e.g. Feller (1970), &quot;An introduction to probability theory and its applications&quot;, 3rd ed.

== &quot;N&quot;-player ruin problem==

The above-described problem (2 players) is a special case of the so-called N-Player Ruin problem.
Here formula_35 players with initial capital formula_36 dollars, respectively, play a sequence of (arbitrary) independent games and win and lose certain amounts of dollars from and to each other according to fixed rules. The sequence of games ends as soon as at least one player is ruined. Standard Markov chain methods can be applied to solve this more general problem in principle, but the computations quickly become prohibitive as soon as the number of players or their initial capitals increase. For formula_37 and large initial capitals formula_38 the solution can be well approximated by using two-dimensional Brownian motion. (For formula_39 this is not possible.)
In practice the true problem is to find the solution for the typical cases of formula_39 and limited initial capital.
Swan (2006) proposed an algorithm based on matrix-analytic methods (Folding Algorithm for ruin problems) which significantly reduces the order of the computational task in such cases.

==History==


===Cedars of Lebanon Hospital===
Founded by Jewish businessman Kaspare Cohn, Cedars of Lebanon Hospital was established as the Kaspare Cohn Hospital in 1902. At the time, Cohn donated a two-story Victorian house at 1441 Carroll Avenue in the Angeleno Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. The hospital had just 12 beds when it opened on September 21, 1902, and its services were initially free. From 1906 to 1910, Dr. Sarah Vasen, the first Jewish female doctor in Los Angeles, acted as superintendent. In 1910, the hospital relocated and expanded to Stephenson Avenue (now Whittier Boulevard), where it had 50 beds and a backhouse containing a 10-cot tubercular ward. It gradually transformed from a charity-based hospital to a general hospital and began to charge patients. In 1930, the hospital moved to 4833 Fountain Avenue, where it opened as Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, named after the religiously significant Lebanon cedars tree (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;), which were highly sought after and used to build King Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem. Cedars of Lebanon Hospital could accommodate 279 patients and was large and comprehensive, with all of the components of a modern medical facility.

===Mount Sinai Hospital===
Meanwhile, in 1918, the Bikur Cholim Society opened a two-room hospice, the Bikur Cholim Hospice, when the Great Influenza Pandemic hit the United States of America. In 1921, the hospice relocated to an eight-bed facility in Boyle Heights and was renamed Bikur Cholim Hospital. On November 7, 1926, it was renamed Mount Sinai Hospital and moved to a 50-bed facility on Bonnie Beach Place in Los Angeles. Later, in 1950, a new Mount Sinai Hospital was built on land donated by Emma and Hyman Levine at 8700 Beverly Boulevard. They had purchased 3.5 acres of land and donated the property to Mount Sinai Hospital under the auspices of their foundation.

===Merger of Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital===

Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital merged in 1961 to form Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The unification of the two hospitals was made necessary by population growth and modern medical progress. A donation of $4 million by the Max Factor Family Foundation allowed the construction of the main hospital building, which broke ground on November 5, 1972, and opened on April 3, 1976. The new hospital was designed jointly by Albert C. Martin &amp; Associates and Charles Luckman Associates. The main contractor was Robert E. McKee, Inc. While the main hospital buildings were being built the Thalians Mental Health Center also designed by Martin and Luckman was being constructed. The main contractor was the Del E. Webb Corporation and the Thalians Center was completed in 1973.

In 1994, the Cedars-Sinai Health System was established, comprising the Cedars-Sinai Medical Care Foundation, the Burns and Allen Research Institute, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The Burns and Allen Research Institute, named for George Burns and his wife, Gracie Allen, is located inside the Barbara and Marvin Davis Research Building. Opened in 1996, it houses biomedical research aimed at discovering genetic, molecular and immunological factors that trigger disease.

In 2006, Cedars-Sinai added the Saperstein Critical Care Tower with 150 ICU beds.

, Cedars-Sinai served 54,947 inpatients, 350,405 outpatients, and 77,964 visits to the emergency room. Cedars-Sinai received high rankings in 11 of the 16 specialties, ranking in the top 10 for digestive disorders and in the top 25 for five other specialties as listed below.

In 2013, Cedars-Sinai opened its 800,000-square-foot Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion, which consists of eight stories of program space located over a six-story parking structure, on the eastern edge of its campus at the corner of San Vicente Boulevard and Gracie Allen Drive. Designed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum, the pavilion brings patient care and translational research together in one site. The Advanced Health Sciences Pavilion houses the Cedars-Sinai&#x27;s neurosciences programs, the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and Regenerative Medicine Institute laboratories, as well as outpatient surgery suites, an imaging area, and an education center.

==Rankings==
In 2022–23, &quot;U.S News&quot; ranked Cedars-Sinai the best hospital in California (beating UCLA Medical Center which topped in 2021–22 rankings), and 2nd best in the United States (only behind Mayo Clinic). Cedars-Sinai ranked as follows in adult medical specialties in the nationwide &quot;U.S. News&quot; Best Hospitals 2022–23 report:
Cedars-Sinai ranked as follows in the 2009 Los Angeles area residents&#x27; &quot;Most Preferred Hospital for All Health Needs&quot; ranking:

Rapper Eazy-E died aged 30 in Cedars-Sinai on March 26, 1995 after being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS a month prior. Actress Rebecca Schaeffer died at the age of 21 on July 18, 1989 30 minutes after her arrival due to gunshot wounds caused by getting shot by Robert John Bardo

==Controversy==
In 2008, state regulators found that Cedars-Sinai had placed the Quaid twins and others in immediate jeopardy by its improper handling of blood-thinning medication.

According to articles in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2009, Cedars-Sinai was under investigation for significant radiation overdoses of 206 patients during CT brain perfusion scans during an 18-month period. Since the initial investigation, it was found that GE sold several products to various medical centers with faulty radiation monitoring devices.

In 2011, Cedars-Sinai again created controversy by denying a liver transplant to medical marijuana patient Norman Smith. They removed Mr. Smith from a transplant waiting list for &quot;non-compliance of our substance abuse contract&quot;, despite his own oncologist at Cedars-Sinai having recommended that he use the marijuana for his pain and chemotherapy. Dr. Steven D. Colquhoun, director of the Liver Transplant Program, said that the hospital &quot;must consider issues of substance abuse seriously&quot;, but the transplant center did not seriously consider whether Mr. Smith was &quot;using&quot; marijuana versus &quot;abusing&quot; it. In 2012, Cedars-Sinai denied a liver transplant to a second patient, Toni Trujillo, after her Cedars-Sinai doctors knew and approved of her legal use of medical marijuana. In both cases, the patients acceded to the hospital&#x27;s demand and stopped using medical marijuana, despite its therapeutic benefits for them, but were both sent back to the bottom of the transplant list. Smith&#x27;s death inspired Americans for Safe Access to lobby for the California Medical Cannabis Organ Transplant Act (AB 258), which was enacted in July 2015 to protect future patients from dying at the hands of medical establishments prejudiced against the legal use of medical cannabis.

==Patient data security breaches==
On June 18 through June 24, 2013, six employees were terminated for inappropriately accessing 14 patient records around the time Kim Kardashian and Kanye West&#x27;s daughter was born at the hospital. On June 23, 2014, an unencrypted employee laptop was stolen from an employee&#x27;s home. The laptop contained patient Social Security numbers and patient health data.

==Art collection==
First developed by philanthropists Frederick and Marcia Weisman, Cedars-Sinai&#x27;s modern and contemporary art collection dates to 1976 and includes more than 4,000 original paintings, sculptures, new media installations and limited-edition prints by the likes of Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg, Richard Diebenkorn, Sam Francis, Claes Oldenburg, Willem de Kooning, Raymond Pettibon and Pablo Picasso. At any given time, 90 to 95 percent of the collection is on display. Nine large-scale works are located in courtyards, parking lots and public walkways throughout the approximately 30-acre campus. The collection consists entirely of gifts from donors, other institutions and occasionally the artists themselves.

There is a statue of Moses in the parking lot. However the two tablets of the covenant that, according to the story, Moses received at Mount Sinai, are blank on the statue. This led many people to ask, &quot;why is Moses in the parking lot?&quot; In response, the director of community engagement, Jonathan Schreiber, has given a brief lecture explaining the history of the statues role in the hospital merger.

<text>Tryptamine is an indolamine metabolite of the essential amino acid tryptophan. The chemical structure is defined by an indole—a fused benzene and pyrrole ring, and a 2-aminoethyl group at the second carbon (third aromatic atom, with the first one being the heterocyclic nitrogen). The structure of tryptamine is a shared feature of certain aminergic neuromodulators including melatonin, serotonin, bufotenin and psychedelic derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, psilocin and others.

Tryptamine has been shown to activate serotonin receptors and trace amine-associated receptors expressed in the mammalian brain, and regulates the activity of dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. In the human gut, symbiotic bacteria convert dietary tryptophan to tryptamine, which activates 5-HT4 receptors and regulates gastrointestinal motility.

Multiple tryptamine-derived drugs have been developed to treat migraines, while trace amine-associated receptors are being explored as a potential treatment target for neuropsychiatric disorders.

== Natural occurrences ==
&quot;For a list of plants, fungi and animals containing tryptamines, see List of psychoactive plants and List of naturally occurring tryptamines.&quot;

=== Mammalian brain ===
Endogenous levels of tryptamine in the mammalian brain are less than 100 ng per gram of tissue. However, elevated levels of trace amines have been observed in patients with certain neuropsychiatric disorders taking medications, such as bipolar depression and schizophrenia.

=== Mammalian gut microbiome ===
Tryptamine is relatively abundant in the gut and feces of humans and rodents. Commensal bacteria, including &quot;Ruminococcus gnavus&quot; and &quot;Clostridium sporogenes&quot; in the gastrointestinal tract, possess the enzyme tryptophan decarboxylase, which aids in the conversion of dietary tryptophan to tryptamine. Tryptamine is a ligand for gut epithelial serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptors and regulates gastrointestinal electrolyte balance through colonic secretions.

== Metabolism ==

=== Biosynthesis ===
To yield tryptamine &quot;in vivo&quot;, tryptophan decarboxylase removes the carboxylic acid group on the α-carbon of tryptophan. Synthetic modifications to tryptamine can produce serotonin and melatonin; however, these pathways do not occur naturally as the main pathway for endogenous neurotransmitter synthesis.

=== Catabolism ===
Monoamine oxidases A and B are the primary enzymes involved in tryptamine metabolism to produce indole-3-acetaldehyde, however it is unclear which isoform is specific to tryptamine degradation.

=== Figure ===
== Biological activity ==
=== Serotonin receptor agonist ===
Tryptamine is known to act as a serotonin receptor agonist, although its potency is limited by rapid inactivation by monoamine oxidases. It has specifically been found to act as a full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ( = 7.36 ± 0.56nM; Emax = 104 ± 4%). Tryptamine was of much lower potency in stimulating the 5-HT2A receptor β-arrestin pathway ( = 3,485 ± 234nM; Emax = 108 ± 16%). In contrast to the 5-HT2A receptor, tryptamine was found to be inactive at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.

==== Gastrointestinal motility ====
Tryptamine produced by mutualistic bacteria in the human gut activates serotonin GPCRs ubiquitously expressed along the colonic epithelium. Upon tryptamine binding, the activated 5-HT4 receptor undergoes a conformational change which allows its Gs alpha subunit to exchange GDP for GTP, and its liberation from the 5-HT4 receptor and βγ subunit. GTP-bound Gs activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP opens chloride and potassium ion channels to drive colonic electrolyte secretion and promote intestinal motility.

=== Monoamine releasing agent ===
Tryptamine has been found to act as a monoamine releasing agent (MRA). It is a releaser of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, in that order of potency ( = 32.6nM, 164nM, and 716nM, respectively). That is, it acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA).

=== Monoaminergic activity enhancer ===
Tryptamine is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its serotonin receptor agonism. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The MAE actions of tryptamine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Synthetic and more potent MAEs like benzofuranylpropylaminopentane (BPAP) and indolylpropylaminopentane (IPAP) have been derived from tryptamine.

=== TAAR1 agonist ===
Tryptamine is an agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). It is a potent TAAR1 full agonist in rats, a weak TAAR1 full agonist in mice, and a very weak TAAR1 partial agonist in humans. Tryptamine may act as a trace neuromodulator in some species via activation of TAAR1 signaling.

The TAAR1 is a stimulatory G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is weakly expressed in the intracellular compartment of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. TAAR1 agonists have been implicated in regulating monoaminergic neurotransmission, for instance by activating G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) and reducing neuronal firing via facilitation of membrane hyperpolarization through the efflux of potassium ions.

TAAR1 agonists are under investigation as a novel treatment for neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, drug addiction, and depression. The TAAR1 is expressed in brain structures associated with dopamine systems, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and serotonin systems in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN). Additionally, the human TAAR1 gene is localized at 6q23.2 on the human chromosome, which is a susceptibility locus for mood disorders and schizophrenia. Activation of TAAR1 suggests a potential novel treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders, as TAAR1 agonists produce antipsychotic-like, anti-addictive, and antidepressant-like effects in animals.

===Effects in animals and humans===
In a published clinical study, tryptamine, at a total dose of 23 to 277mg by intravenous infusion, produced hallucinogenic effects or perceptual disturbances similar to those of small doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It also produced other LSD-like effects, including pupil dilation, increased blood pressure, and increased force of the patellar reflex. Tryptamine produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tingling sensations, sweating, and bodily heaviness among others as well. Conversely, there were no changes in heart rate or respiratory rate. The onset of the effects was rapid and the duration was very short. This can be attributed to the very rapid metabolism of tryptamine by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and its very short elimination half-life.

In animals, tryptamine, alone and/or in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), produces behavioral changes such as hyperlocomotion and reversal of reserpine-induced behavioral depression. In addition, it produces effects like hyperthermia, tachycardia, myoclonus, and seizures or convulsions, among others. Findings on tryptamine and the head-twitch response in rodents have been mixed, with some studies reporting no effect, some studies reporting induction of head twitches by tryptamine, and others reporting that tryptamine actually antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitches. Another study found that combination of tryptamine with an MAOI dose-dependently produced head twitches. Head twitches in rodents are a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects. Many of the effects of tryptamine can be reversed by serotonin receptor antagonists like metergoline, metitepine (methiothepin), and cyproheptadine. Conversely, the effects of tryptamine in animals are profoundly augmented by MAOIs due to inhibition of its metabolism.

Tryptamine seems to also elevate prolactin and cortisol levels in animals and/or humans.

The values of tryptamine in animals include 100mg/kg i.p. in mice, 500mg/kg s.c. in mice, and 223mg/kg i.p. in rats.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Tryptamine produced endogenously or administered peripherally is readily able to cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. This is in contrast to serotonin, which is peripherally selective.

Tryptamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Its metabolism is described as extremely rapid and its elimination half-life and duration as very short. In addition, its duration is described as shorter than that of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Brain tryptamine levels are increased up to 300-fold by MAOIs in animals. In addition, the effects of exogenous tryptamine are strongly augmented by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

Tryptamine is excreted in urine and its rate of urinary excretion has been reported to be pH-dependent.

==Chemistry==
Tryptamine is a substituted tryptamine derivative and trace amine and is structurally related to the amino acid tryptophan.

The experimental log P of tryptamine is 1.55.

===Derivatives===
The endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and melatonin (5-methoxy-&quot;N&quot;-acetyltryptamine), as well as trace amines like &quot;N&quot;-methyltryptamine (NMT), &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and bufotenin (&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylserotonin), are derivatives of tryptamine.

A variety of drugs, including both naturally occurring and pharmaceutical substances, are derivatives of tryptamine. These include the tryptamine psychedelics like psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT; tryptamine stimulants, entactogens, psychedelics, and/or antidepressants like α-methyltryptamine (αMT) and α-ethyltryptamine (αET); triptan antimigraine agents like sumatriptan; certain antipsychotics like oxypertine; and the sleep aid melatonin.

Various other drugs, including ergolines and lysergamides like the psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the antimigraine agents ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and methysergide, and the antiparkinsonian agents bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, and pergolide; β-carbolines like harmine (some of which are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)); &quot;Iboga&quot; alkaloids like the hallucinogen ibogaine; yohimbans like the α2 blocker yohimbine; antipsychotics like ciclindole and flucindole; and the MAOI antidepressant metralindole, can all be thought of as cyclized tryptamine derivatives.

Drugs very closely related to tryptamines, but technically not tryptamines themselves, include certain triptans like avitriptan and naratriptan; the antipsychotics sertindole and tepirindole; and the MAOI antidepressants pirlindole and tetrindole.

<text>Neuromorphic computing is an approach to computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons to do computations. In recent times, the term &quot;neuromorphic&quot; has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). Recent advances have even discovered ways to mimic the human nervous system through liquid solutions of chemical systems.

A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.

Neuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems. One of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering was proposed by Carver Mead in the late 1980s.

==Neurological inspiration==
Neuromorphic engineering is for now set apart by the inspiration it takes from what we know about the structure and operations of the brain. Neuromorphic engineering translates what we know about the brain&#x27;s function into computer systems. Work has mostly focused on replicating the analog nature of biological computation and the role of neurons in cognition.

The biological processes of neurons and their synapses are dauntingly complex, and thus very difficult to artificially simulate. A key feature of biological brains is that all of the processing in neurons uses analog chemical signals. This makes it hard to replicate brains in computers because the current generation of computers is completely digital. However, the characteristics of these chemical signals can be abstracted into mathematical functions that closely capture the essence of the neuron&#x27;s operations.

The goal of neuromorphic computing is not to perfectly mimic the brain and all of its functions, but instead to extract what is known of its structure and operations to be used in a practical computing system. No neuromorphic system will claim nor attempt to reproduce every element of neurons and synapses, but all adhere to the idea that computation is highly distributed throughout a series of small computing elements analogous to a neuron. While this sentiment is standard, researchers chase this goal with different methods. Anatomical neural wiring diagrams that are being imaged by electron microscopy and functional neural connection maps that could be potentially obtained via intracellular recording at scale can be used to better inspire, if not exactly mimicked, neuromorphic computing systems with more details.

==Implementation==
The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. The implementation details overlap with the concepts of Artificial Immune Systems. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g. using Python-based frameworks such as snnTorch, or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g. using BindsNet.

==Examples==

As early as 2006, researchers at Georgia Tech published a field programmable neural array. This chip was the first in a line of increasingly complex arrays of floating gate transistors that allowed programmability of charge on the gates of MOSFETs to model the channel-ion characteristics of neurons in the brain and was one of the first cases of a silicon programmable array of neurons.

In November 2011, a group of MIT researchers created a computer chip that mimics the analog, ion-based communication in a synapse between two neurons using 400 transistors and standard CMOS manufacturing techniques.

In June 2012, spintronic researchers at Purdue University presented a paper on the design of a neuromorphic chip using lateral spin valves and memristors. They argue that the architecture works similarly to neurons and can therefore be used to test methods of reproducing the brain&#x27;s processing. In addition, these chips are significantly more energy-efficient than conventional ones.

Research at HP Labs on Mott memristors has shown that while they can be non-volatile, the volatile behavior exhibited at temperatures significantly below the phase transition temperature can be exploited to fabricate a neuristor, a biologically-inspired device that mimics behavior found in neurons. In September 2013, they presented models and simulations that show how the spiking behavior of these neuristors can be used to form the components required for a Turing machine.

Neurogrid, built by &quot;Brains in Silicon&quot; at Stanford University, is an example of hardware designed using neuromorphic engineering principles. The circuit board is composed of 16 custom-designed chips, referred to as NeuroCores. Each NeuroCore&#x27;s analog circuitry is designed to emulate neural elements for 65536 neurons, maximizing energy efficiency. The emulated neurons are connected using digital circuitry designed to maximize spiking throughput.

A research project with implications for neuromorphic engineering is the Human Brain Project that is attempting to simulate a complete human brain in a supercomputer using biological data. It is made up of a group of researchers in neuroscience, medicine, and computing. Henry Markram, the project&#x27;s co-director, has stated that the project proposes to establish a foundation to explore and understand the brain and its diseases, and to use that knowledge to build new computing technologies. The three primary goals of the project are to better understand how the pieces of the brain fit and work together, to understand how to objectively diagnose and treat brain diseases and to use the understanding of the human brain to develop neuromorphic computers. Since the simulation of a complete human brain will require a powerful supercomputer, the current focus on neuromorphic computers is being encouraged. $1.3billion has been allocated to the project by The European Commission.

Other research with implications for neuromorphic engineering involve the BRAIN Initiative and the TrueNorth chip from IBM. Neuromorphic devices have also been demonstrated using nanocrystals, nanowires, and conducting polymers. There also is development of a memristive device for quantum neuromorphic architectures. In 2022, researchers at MIT have reported the development of brain-inspired artificial synapses, using the ion proton (), for &#x27;analog deep learning&#x27;.

Intel unveiled its neuromorphic research chip, called &quot;Loihi&quot;, in October 2017. The chip uses an asynchronous spiking neural network (SNN) to implement adaptive self-modifying event-driven fine-grained parallel computations used to implement learning and inference with high efficiency.

IMEC, a Belgium-based nanoelectronics research center, demonstrated the world&#x27;s first self-learning neuromorphic chip. The brain-inspired chip, based on OxRAM technology, has the capability of self-learning and has been demonstrated to have the ability to compose music. IMEC released the 30-second tune composed by the prototype. The chip was sequentially loaded with songs in the same time signature and style. The songs were old Belgian and French flute minuets, from which the chip learned the rules at play and then applied them.

The Blue Brain Project, led by Henry Markram, aims to build biologically detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mouse brain. The Blue Brain Project has created in silico models of rodent brains, while attempting to replicate as many details about its biology as possible. The supercomputer-based simulations offer new perspectives on understanding the structure and functions of the brain.

The European Union funded a series of projects at the University of Heidelberg, which led to the development of BrainScaleS (brain-inspired multiscale computation in neuromorphic hybrid systems), a hybrid analog neuromorphic supercomputer located at Heidelberg University, Germany. It was developed as part of the Human Brain Project neuromorphic computing platform and is the complement to the SpiNNaker supercomputer (which is based on digital technology). The architecture used in BrainScaleS mimics biological neurons and their connections on a physical level; additionally, since the components are made of silicon, these model neurons operate on average 864 times (24 hours of real time is 100 seconds in the machine simulation) faster than that of their biological counterparts.

In 2019, the European Union funded the project &quot;Neuromorphic quantum computing&quot; exploring the use of neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as &#x27;n.quantum computing&#x27;) is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand, and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the &quot;minimum&quot;. Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.

Brainchip announced in October 2021 that it was taking orders for its Akida AI Processor Development Kits and in January 2022 that it was taking orders for its Akida AI Processor PCIe boards, making it the world&#x27;s first commercially available neuromorphic processor.

===Neuromemristive systems===
Neuromemristive systems are a subclass of neuromorphic computing systems that focuses on the use of memristors to implement neuroplasticity. While neuromorphic engineering focuses on mimicking biological behavior, neuromemristive systems focus on abstraction. For example, a neuromemristive system may replace the details of a cortical microcircuit&#x27;s behavior with an abstract neural network model.

There exist several neuron inspired threshold logic functions implemented with memristors that have applications in high level pattern recognition applications. Some of the applications reported recently include speech recognition, face recognition and object recognition. They also find applications in replacing conventional digital logic gates.

For (quasi)ideal passive memristive circuits, the evolution of the memristive memories can be written in a closed form (Caravelli–Traversa–Di Ventra equation):

:formula_1

as a function of the properties of the physical memristive network and the external sources. The equation is valid for the case of the Williams-Strukov original toy model, as in the case of ideal memristors, formula_2. However, the hypothesis of the existence of an ideal memristor is debatable. In the equation above, formula_3 is the &quot;forgetting&quot; time scale constant, typically associated to memory volatility, while formula_4 is the ratio of &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; values of the limit resistances of the memristors, formula_5 is the vector of the sources of the circuit and formula_6 is a projector on the fundamental loops of the circuit. The constant formula_7 has the dimension of a voltage and is associated to the properties of the memristor; its physical origin is the charge mobility in the conductor. The diagonal matrix and vector formula_8 and formula_9 respectively, are instead the internal value of the memristors, with values between 0 and 1. This equation thus requires adding extra constraints on the memory values in order to be reliable.

It has been recently shown that the equation above exhibits tunneling phenomena and used to study Lyapunov functions.

===Neuromorphic sensors===
The concept of neuromorphic systems can be extended to sensors (not just to computation). An example of this applied to detecting light is the retinomorphic sensor or, when employed in an array, the event camera. An event camera&#x27;s pixels all register changes in brightness levels individually, which makes these cameras comparable to human eyesight in their theoretical power consumption. In 2022, researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research reported an organic artificial spiking neuron that exhibits the signal diversity of biological neurons while operating in the biological wetware, thus enabling &quot;in-situ&quot; neuromorphic sensing and biointerfacing applications.

=== Military applications ===

The Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, a branch of the U.S. military, is a center dedicated to the procurement and implementation of AI software and neuromorphic hardware for combat use. Specific applications include smart headsets/goggles and robots. JAIC intends to rely heavily on neuromorphic technology to connect &quot;every sensor (to) every shooter&quot; within a network of neuromorphic-enabled units.

== Ethical and legal considerations ==
While the interdisciplinary concept of neuromorphic engineering is relatively new, many of the same ethical considerations apply to neuromorphic systems as apply to human-like machines and artificial intelligence in general. However, the fact that neuromorphic systems are designed to mimic a human brain gives rise to unique ethical questions surrounding their usage.

However, the practical debate is that neuromorphic hardware as well as artificial &quot;neural networks&quot; are immensely simplified models of how the brain operates or processes information at a much lower complexity in terms of size and functional technology and a much more regular structure in terms of connectivity. Comparing neuromorphic chips to the brain is a very crude comparison similar to comparing a plane to a bird just because they both have wings and a tail. The fact is that biological neural cognitive systems are many orders of magnitude more energy- and compute-efficient than current state-of-the-art AI and neuromorphic engineering is an attempt to narrow this gap by inspiring from the brain&#x27;s mechanism just like many engineering designs have bio-inspired features.

=== Social concerns ===
Significant ethical limitations may be placed on neuromorphic engineering due to public perception. Special Eurobarometer 382: Public Attitudes Towards Robots, a survey conducted by the European Commission, found that 60% of European Union citizens wanted a ban of robots in the care of children, the elderly, or the disabled. Furthermore, 34% were in favor of a ban on robots in education, 27% in healthcare, and 20% in leisure. The European Commission classifies these areas as notably &quot;human.&quot; The report cites increased public concern with robots that are able to mimic or replicate human functions. Neuromorphic engineering, by definition, is designed to replicate the function of the human brain.

The social concerns surrounding neuromorphic engineering are likely to become even more profound in the future. The European Commission found that EU citizens between the ages of 15 and 24 are more likely to think of robots as human-like (as opposed to instrument-like) than EU citizens over the age of 55. When presented an image of a robot that had been defined as human-like, 75% of EU citizens aged 15–24 said it corresponded with the idea they had of robots while only 57% of EU citizens over the age of 55 responded the same way. The human-like nature of neuromorphic systems, therefore, could place them in the categories of robots many EU citizens would like to see banned in the future.

=== Personhood ===
As neuromorphic systems have become increasingly advanced, some scholars have advocated for granting personhood rights to these systems. Daniel Lim, a critic of technology development in the Human Brain Project, which aims to advance brain-inspired computing, has argued that advancement in neuromorphic computing could lead to machine consciousness or personhood. If these systems are to be treated as people, then many tasks humans perform using neuromorphic systems, including their termination, may be morally impermissible as these acts would violate their autonomy.

=== Ownership and property rights ===
There is significant legal debate around property rights and artificial intelligence. In &quot;Acohs Pty Ltd v. Ucorp Pty Ltd&quot;, Justice Christopher Jessup of the Federal Court of Australia found that the source code for Material Safety Data Sheets could not be copyrighted as it was generated by a software interface rather than a human author. The same question may apply to neuromorphic systems: if a neuromorphic system successfully mimics a human brain and produces a piece of original work, who, if anyone, should be able to claim ownership of the work?

<text>Zelenogorsk (), known as Terijoki prior to 1948 (a name still used in Finnish and Swedish), is a municipal town in Kurortny District of the federal city of St. Petersburg, Russia, located in part of the Karelian Isthmus on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Population: 

It has a station on the St. Petersburg-Vyborg railroad. It is located about northwest of central Saint Petersburg.

==History==

From 1323 to 1721 the Zelenogorsk area was a part of Sweden. It was ceded to Russia in 1721, becoming &quot;Old Finland&quot;, which again was united with the Grand-Duchy of Finland in 1811. Until 1917, Terijoki was part of the Grand-Duchy of Finland, ruled by the Grand Dukes of Finland, who were the Tsars of Russia, (1812–1917).

Even though all of Finland was part of the Russian Empire, a customs border was located at Terijoki. A valid passport was needed for crossing the border between Russia and the Grand Duchy of Finland.

Vladimir Lenin managed to travel in secrecy over the internal border to Finland in 1907. Ten years later, in April 1917, he would return through the Terijoki border control at the head of the contingent of Bolshevik exiles that had accompanied him from Switzerland.

With completion of the Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway in 1870, Terijoki became a popular summer resort, and was frequented by St. Petersburg&#x27;s upper class until closure of the border during the Russian Revolution (1917).

When the Republic of Finland gained independence on 6 December 1917, Terijoki became a part of it, and remained so until it was occupied by the Soviet Union during the Winter War (1939-1940). It was regained by Finland in 1941 during the Continuation War (1941-1944), but was then occupied again by the Red Army during the later stages of the same war and annexed to the Soviet Union in 1944.

During the Winter War Terijoki become known as the seat of Otto Wille Kuusinen&#x27;s Finnish Democratic Republic.

After the Second World War, its original Finnish population was expelled. They were relocated close to Helsinki and Soviet citizens were relocated to Terijoki. Around the start of the 21st century, the town&#x27;s population was estimated to have been a few thousand, rising to above 50,000 in summer.

==Contemporary times==
As of the beginning of the 21st century, Zelenogorsk is actively developing in many directions. Various actions to improve the quality of life in Zelenogorsk and modernize the region have been undertaken.

July 25 is the date of the annually celebrated City Day. On this day in 2009, a fountain was opened in the central square of the city park, and a sculpture named &quot;Boots of the Traveller&quot; was solemnly unveiled along the central avenue.

At the Dachshund monument, parades of dachshunds have been held, and the museum of vintage vehicles has gained additional new exhibits.

At a concert in honor of City Day in 2009, known musicians performed, such as Music hall theatre of St. Petersburg, Edita Piekha, and others,

==Politics==
The current body of local government - the Municipal Council - has been operating since 1998. In the elections on 19 September 2014, the 5th convocation was elected (10 deputies - 4 of those from United Russia). The head of the municipal entity (who exercises the powers of the chairman of the Municipal Council and is the highest official of the municipal entity) is the executive and administrative body of the municipality - the Local Administration.

<text>Bitter Sweet is an operetta in three acts, with book, music and lyrics by Noël Coward. The story, set in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century England and Austria-Hungary, centres on a young woman&#x27;s elopement with her music teacher. The songs from the score include &quot;The Call of Life&quot;, &quot;If You Could Only Come with Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot;, &quot;Dear Little Café&quot;, &quot;If Love Were All&quot;, &quot;Ladies of the Town&quot;, &quot;Tokay&quot;, &quot;Zigeuner&quot; and &quot;Green Carnation&quot;.

The show had a long run in the West End from 1929 to 1931, and a more modest one on Broadway in 1929–1930. The work has twice been adapted for the cinema, and the complete score has been recorded for CD.

==Background==
Coward wrote the leading role of Sari with Gertrude Lawrence in mind, but the vocal demands of the part were beyond her capabilities. His second choice, Evelyn Laye, refused the role because of a private grievance against the producer of the show, C. B. Cochran. Coward&#x27;s third choice, Peggy Wood, made a considerable success in the part, and Laye, realising her mistake in turning it down, willingly accepted the role in the subsequent Broadway production. For the part of the leading man, Cochran and Coward toured the theatres of Europe in search of someone suitable. According to Coward, a likely candidate named Hans Unterfucker was ruled out because of his name, and George Metaxa was cast.

===Original cast===
* Parker, a butler – Claude Farrow
* Dolly Chamberlain – Dorothy Bond
* Lord Henry – William Harn
* Vincent Howard – Billy Milton
* Marchioness of Shayne (Sari) – Peggy Wood
* Marquess of Shayne – Alan Napier
* Carl Linden – George Metaxa
* Manon la Crevette – Ivy St Helier
* Nita – Isla Bevan
* Captain August Lutte – Austin Trevor
* Hugh Devon – Robert Newton
* Helen – Nancy Bevill
* Jackie – Maureen Moore
* Frank – Arthur Alexander

==Plot==

=== Act I ===
In 1929, the elderly and widowed, but still lively, Marchioness of Shayne is holding a party at her home in London to celebrate the impending society marriage of a young woman, Dolly Chamberlain, who is in love not with her fiancé but with a poor musician (&quot;That Wonderful Melody&quot;). Dolly is torn between love and fortune, and Lady Shane is reminded of her own youth (&quot;The Call of Life&quot;).

Nearly 55 years earlier, in 1875, Lady Shayne is the young Sarah Millick, a wealthy London society debutante, who is having a singing lesson with her dashing music teacher, Carl Linden. The spirited Sarah is engaged to Lord Hugh, a wealthy but stuffy young nobleman, but Sarah and Carl have fallen in love (&quot;If You Could Only Come With Me&quot;). Carl&#x27;s integrity makes him decide not to ruin Sarah&#x27;s &#x27;proper&#x27; life and return directly to his native Austria, but vows to think of Sarah each Spring (&quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot;). At the pre-wedding party, Sarah realises she would be unhappy with Lord Hugh and that true love is more important (&quot;What Is Love?&quot;). Carl is entertaining at the party (&quot;The Last Dance&quot;). Later, during a game of blindman&#x27;s buff, Carl and Sarah declare their mutual love and decide to elope to Vienna.

=== Act II ===
Five years later, in Vienna, Carl is a bandleader, and Sarah (now called Sari), sings his songs, but their employment at Schlick&#x27;s Café, a racy establishment patronised by army officers and whores, requires Sari to dance with the patrons, and perhaps more (&quot;Ladies of the Town&quot;). Carl&#x27;s previous lover, Manon La Crevette, entertains at the café and expresses feelings of lost love (&quot;If Love Were All&quot;). Sari and Carl plan to quit and find their dream café (&quot;Dear Little Café&quot;), but it&#x27;s a busy night (&quot;Tokay&quot;), and after Manon&#x27;s number (&quot;Bonne Nuit, Merci&quot;), Sari is obliged to dance with an army captain who makes a determined pass, provoking Carl to intervene. The captain challenges him to a duel, which he wins easily, killing Carl; Sari is distraught, as Manon reprises a sad waltz number (&quot;Kiss Me&quot;).

=== Act III ===
Thirteen years pass, and in 1893 London it is the Gay Nineties (&quot;Ta Ra Ra Boom De Ay&quot;; &quot;Green Carnation&quot;). The young ladies are now respectable society matrons (&quot;Alas! The Time is Past&quot;). Sari, now a Viennese star singing Carl&#x27;s music (&quot;Zigeuner&quot;), is pursued by the Marquis of Shayne, who seeks to restore her youthful spirit. He has proposed to her in every European capital, and now home in London, she finally accepts him, but reprises &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot; to her lost love, Carl.

Again at the 1929 party, Dolly, inspired by Lady Shane&#x27;s story of love pursued and lost, rejects her society fiancé and declares her love for the poor musician, whose reaction is to burst into a syncopated piano rendition of &quot;I&#x27;ll See You Again&quot; as the heartbroken Sarah gives way to bitter mirth.

==Critical reception==
After the opening night in Manchester the reviewer in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote that the future of the show seemed rosy: &quot;If a wealth of light melody, a spice of wit, and much beauty of setting can assure it, Mr Coward need have no misgivings&quot;. In London, James Agate praised the piece: &quot;a thundering good job … a thoroughly good light entertainment&quot;. When the piece was revived in 1988, Jeremy Kingston wrote in &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Coward&#x27;s melodic gift reached its peak in this show, with its gipsy music, drinking song, witty jokes about the gay Nineties and the waltzes that, once heard, are imperishable.&quot;

==Productions==
The piece, directed by Coward, opened on 2 July 1929 at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, before the London premiere at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on 18 July. It ran in London for 697 performances, at five different theatres, concluding its run at the Lyceum, with Laye returning from New York to succeed Wood as Sari. Ivy St. Helier played Manon, and the role of the aged Marquess of Shayne was played by the 26-year-old Alan Napier, later to gain fame as Batman&#x27;s butler, Alfred.

With the success of the London production, Cochran wanted a Broadway presentation. Rather than wait until the end of the West End run and take the original cast to New York, Cochran insisted on moving quickly. The musical opened on Broadway on 5 November 1929, starring Evelyn Laye as Sari. She was well received by audiences and critics, but otherwise the cast was not as strong as their London counterparts. The production ran for 159 performances, closing on 22 March 1930.

Although popular with amateur operatic societies, &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; has had few professional revivals. A Broadway production played in 1934, starring Evelyn Herbert and Allan Jones. In America, the St. Louis Municipal Opera presented six productions of &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; between 1933 and 1953 as well as one in 1974. The Long Beach Civic Light Opera in Southern California staged a production in 1983 starring Shirley Jones as Sari. The first professional revival in London was in 1988 at Sadler&#x27;s Wells; Valerie Masterson and Ann Mackay alternated as Sari, with Martin Smith as Carl and Rosemary Ashe as Manon. The Ohio Light Opera produced &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; in 1993 and 1998.

==Films and recordings==
The piece has been filmed twice. The first, in 1933, directed by Herbert Wilcox was filmed in black-and-white, with Anna Neagle and Fernand Gravet in the leading roles. An opulent Technicolor version for MGM in 1940, directed by W. S. Van Dyke, starred Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. In both cases, the score was heavily cut. Coward disliked the much-rewritten 1940 film and vowed that no more of his plays would be filmed in Hollywood. In 1951 he told &quot;The Daily Express&quot;, &quot;I was saving up &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; as an investment for my old age. After MGM&#x27;s dreadful film I can never revive it.&quot;

Abridged recordings have been made starring Vanessa Lee (1960) and June Bronhill (1969) The first recording of the complete score was issued in 1989, based on the 1988 Sadler&#x27;s Wells production, with Masterson as Sari.

<doc id="453100" wikidata="Q2465439" url="?curid=453100" title="Twelfth Army (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Twelfth Army was a British Army formation during the Second World War. The Twelfth Army denotation was actually used twice; firstly, in 1943, for a fictional formation and secondly, in 1944/45, in Burma.

The Twelfth Army moniker was originally used by Advanced Headquarters &#x27;A&#x27; Force, a Cairo-based deception department created by Dudley Clarke, for a formation used in Operation Barclay and Operation Zeppelin. It was later used for a real formation in Burma, which took over operations from the Fourteenth Army and would later become Burma Command.

==1943: Middle East==

A British Twelfth Army was initially invented by &#x27;A&#x27; Force as part as the deception plan for Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943. The Western Allies attempted to convince the Germans that their main effort during 1943 would be to land the Twelfth Army in Greece and then advance into the eastern Balkans during the early part of the summer of 1943 with the aim of bringing Turkey into the war and then linking up with the Soviet Red Army. The deception plan attempted to convince the Germans that this army had twelve divisions under its control and was located in Egypt. The army&#x27;s formation insignia was a trained seal balancing on its nose a terrestrial globe showing the Eastern Hemisphere, black on a white background. The insignia was supposed to symbolize an amphibious creature treating the whole world as its own.

===Subordinate units===

Between 1943 and 1945, when it was disbanded to allow the formation of the second British Twelfth Army, its nominal existence was used to create the impression of a standing threat to the Balkans. During this period the units shown under its control varied, depending on the target chosen. The following list includes all units mentioned as forming part of the Twelfth Army or its component corps.

====Corps====
* British III Corps (fictional)
* British XIV Corps (fictional)
* British XVI Corps (fictional)
* Polish III Corps (fictional)

====Divisions====
* Polish 2nd Armored Division
* British 4th Airborne Division (fictional)
* British 5th Airborne Division (fictional)
* British 5th Infantry Division
* Polish 7th Infantry Division
* British 8th Armored Division (fictional)
* Polish 8th Infantry Division (fictional)
* British 15th Motorized Division (fictional)
* British 33rd Infantry Division (fictional)
* British 34th Infantry Division (fictional)
* British 40th Infantry Division (fictional)
* British 42nd Infantry Division (fictional)
* British 56th Infantry Division
* British 57th Infantry Division (fictional)

==1945: Burma==

The second British Twelfth Army was formed on 28 May 1945, to take control of operations in Burma from the Fourteenth Army, which was being withdrawn to plan for Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Malaya by amphibious assault, which was due to take place in August 1945. The army HQ was created by re-designating the HQ of the Indian XXXIII Corps, under Lieutenant-General Sir Montagu Stopford.
After the war, Twelfth Army continued in existence until 1 October, when it was re designated Burma Command. The formation insignia was a Chinthe on a red background, with a superimposed horizontal black stripe on which was written &quot;XII&quot; in white letters.

<text>Simon Plouffe (born June 11, 1956) is a French Canadian mathematician who discovered the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula (BBP algorithm) which permits the computation of the &quot;n&quot;th binary digit of π, in 1995. His other 2022 formula allows extracting the &quot;n&quot;th digit of in decimal. He was born in Saint-Jovite, Quebec.

He co-authored &quot;The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences&quot;, made into the website On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences dedicated to integer sequences later in 1995. In 1975, Plouffe broke the world record for memorizing digits of π by reciting 4096 digits, a record which stood until 1977.

<text>Cradle Mountain is a locality and mountain in the Central Highlands region of the Australian state of Tasmania. The mountain is situated in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.

At above sea level, it is the sixth-highest mountain in Tasmania.

The locality of Cradle Mountain is a rural locality in the local government areas of Meander Valley, Kentish and West Coast in the Launceston and North-west and west local government regions of Tasmania. The locality is about west of the town of Westbury. The 2016 census has a population of 66 for the state suburb of Cradle Mountain.
Cradle Mountain was gazetted as a locality in 1966.
Cradle Mountain (the mountain) occupies a small area in the north-west of the locality, which occupies the northern half of Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park.
Route C132 (Cradle Mountain Road / Dove Lake Road) enters from the north and runs south to Dove Lake, where it ends.

== History ==
Cradle Mountain sits between the Big River and Northern Tasmanian Aboriginal people. Aboriginal Tasmanians were persecuted by the European settlers upon their arrival, and the last free Aboriginals in the area were seen just south of Cradle Mountain in 1836.

===Early European development===
In 1827 and 1828, the first Europeans to explore and summit Cradle Mountain were Joseph Fossey and Henry Hellyer, who were surveying for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company.

Trappers worked in the area from the 1860s until the collapse of the fur trade in the 1950s, although hunting in the park was declared illegal after 1927. They established huts, including Du Cane and Pine Valley, and burned the land to encourage fresh growth and game.

A large expanse of King Billy pines were found by James Smith in 1863, and the area was logged until the 1910s. Smith&#x27;s son continued logging the area on private (but National Park adjacent) land from 1943 to the 1972, ending after significant public protest.

Cattle and sheep grazed in Cradle Valley from 1910 to 1930.

===Environmental protection and tourism===
In the 1910s Gustav and Kate Cowle climbed Cradle Mountain. They found the land beautiful and Gustav proclaimed &quot;This must be a national park for the people for all time. It is magnificent, and people must know about it and enjoy it&quot;.

They began campaigning for the area from Cradle Mountain to Lake St Clair to be a national park, and set up a popular chalet the next year. It was declared a scenic reserve in 1922, a wildlife reserve in 1927 and its current designation of national park from 1947. During this transition former trappers began building huts and guiding bushwalkers, including Paddy Hartnett, Weindorfer and Bob Quaile.

In 1931 fur trapper Bert Nichols blazed the Overland Track starting from Cradle Mountain and heading south to Lake St Clair. By 1935 it was consolidated and used by independent walking parties.

==Geology==
Cradle Mountain is formed by an igneous dolerite sill that intruded the Permian-Jurassic sedimentary layers, cooling to form a broad hard layer. Subsequent erosion from Pleistocene glaciation left caps of dolerite at Cradle Mountain, and surrounding peaks.

==Access==
The area around the mountain has a large number of day walks, as well as being one terminus of the Overland Track. The Overland Track winds through a variety of landscapes to its opposite end— to the south—at Lake St Clair, Australia&#x27;s deepest lake.

The mountain is climbed by walkers virtually year round. It is a strenuous return hike from the Dove Lake car park with a recommended allotted time of six-and-a-half hours. The climb up the rocky part of the mountain involves scrambling over large boulders for several hundred metres. The entire climb is exposed to any bad weather that may arrive quickly, while climbing the upper slopes in winter can be dangerous due to slick ice on the rocks and heavy snow covering holes and other hazards. From the summit, there are views of Dove Lake, Barn Bluff and Mount Ossa.

==Climate==
The area has a Subpolar oceanic climate (&quot;Cfc&quot;) with cool summers and cold, very snowy winters; with heavy precipitation throughout the year which peaks distinctly in the winter months. Climate data are sourced from an altitude of on the exposed western slopes. It receives an average of 47.9 snowy days annually, which can occur in any month of the year.

==Features==
The mountain rises above the glacially formed Dove Lake (), Lake Wilks and Crater Lake.

The mountain has four named summits. In order of height they are Cradle Mountain (), Smithies Peak (), Weindorfers Tower () and Little Horn ().

The mountain itself is named after its resemblance to a gold-mining cradle.

==Flora, fauna and fungi==

===Flora===
The area is covered in a variety of alpine and sub-alpine vegetation, including the colourful deciduous beech, itself an anomaly given that most Australian native flora is evergreen. Alpine coral fern and button grass dominate the alpine wet sedgelands near the mountain summit. Stands of Tasmanian snow gum can be found at slightly lower elevations alongside Tasmanian eyebright, scoparia heath, mountain rocket, waratah, Cheshunt pine and pencil pine. Within the valleys surrounding the mountain, species such as myrtle beech, pandani, sassafras, King Billy pine and celery top pine form thick temperate rainforest with dense, mossy undergrowth.

===Fauna===
Wombats are a common sight throughout the area, while pademelons, Tasmanian devils and echidnas can also be seen. Bird species in the area include green rosellas, black currawongs, pink robins and Tasmanian scrubwrens, while peregrine falcons and wedge-tailed eagles nest on the mountains cliffs. Tiger snakes are a highly venomous snake species known to be found in the area.

===Fungi===
Fungi are also a part of the park&#x27;s biodiversity. While the Management Plan from 1999 for Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park only mentions fungi in the context of their destructive effects (&quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; and &quot;Chalara australis&quot;), the park has a variety of fungi that perform beneficial ecological roles. Parasitic fungi—often regarded negatively—are a vital part of healthy ecosystems, regulating ecosystem functions.

As primary recyclers of organic matter, saprobic fungi break down fallen branches and leaf litter, making vital nutrients available to other organisms. Other fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Although rarely acknowledged, the great majority of plants in Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park (and, indeed, in the world) form mutually beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.

Given the diversity of plants, specialist habitats and micro-climates in the park, a diversity of fungi, including lichens, is also expected to occur. Several hundred species have already been recorded by field naturalists and interested individuals and can be found in the &quot;Atlas of Living Australia&quot;.

Despite their essential roles in underpinning terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are barely recognised as a vital part of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity. Although Australia has national and state level biodiversity conservation strategies and has ratified international conventions, most overlook fungi, including Tasmania&#x27;s Natural Heritage Strategy, which only makes one generic reference to fungi.

One of the more a conspicuous species found in the wetter parts of the park is the strawberry bracket fungus (&quot;Tyromyces pulcherrimus&quot;). It grows on myrtle beech (&quot;Nothofagus cunninghammii&quot;) and snow gums. The Australian citizen-science organisation, Fungimap is documenting and mapping the distribution of fungi including those that occur in national parks.

<text>Regurgitator are an Australian alternative rock band from Brisbane, Queensland, formed in late 1993 by Quan Yeomans on lead vocals, guitar and keyboards; Ben Ely on bass guitar, keyboards and vocals; and Martin Lee on drums. Their debut studio album, &quot;Tu-Plang&quot; was released in May 1996; it was followed by &quot;Unit&quot; in November 1997 which was certified triple platinum. &quot;Unit&quot; won five categories at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998: Album of the Year, Best Alternative Album, Producer of the Year (for Magoo), Engineer of the Year (Magoo) and Best Cover Art (for The Shits). Their third album, &quot;...Art&quot; was released in August 1999.

Regurgitator had two singles reach the top 20 with &quot;Polyester Girl&quot; (May 1998) peaking at No. 14 in Australia and No. 16 in New Zealand; while &quot;Happiness (Rotting My Brain)&quot; (July 1999) also appeared at No. 16 in New Zealand. Martin Lee left Regurgitator in late 1999 and was replaced by Peter Kostic on drums, who was simultaneously a member of Front End Loader (1991–present) and the Hard-Ons (2002–2011). Casual members have included Seja Vogel, from Sekiden; Shane Rudken (Ponyloaf); Dave Atkins (Pangaea, Resin Dogs) among others. Regurgitator&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Eduardo and Rodriguez Wage War on T-Wrecks&quot; was released in July 2001 and was their final studio album for Warner before mutually agreeing to terminate their recording agreement. They then went on to issue four more independent studio albums—&quot;Mish Mash!&quot; recorded as part of the multimedia reality show parody &quot;Band in a Bubble&quot;; &quot;Love and Paranoia&quot; recorded in Rio de Janeiro on Corcovado after licensing the &quot;Band in a Bubble&quot; project to a US version staged in New York City; &quot;Super Happy Fun Times Friends&quot; recorded over three weeks in their home studio; and &quot;Dirty Pop Fantasy&quot; recorded in a Hong Kong apartment before announcing an extended hiatus in December 2013. They commenced playing shows again in mid-2015. Recording at &#x27;Greg&#x27;s Byron Bay &amp; Wild Mountain Sound resulted in ninth album &quot;Headroxx&quot; released in 2018. In 2022 work began on new music which came to be &quot;Invader&quot; released April 2024.

The group&#x27;s spin-off project &quot;Regurgitator&#x27;s Pogogo Show&quot; released their debut album of children&#x27;s music in 2019.

==History==
===1993–1995: Early years===
Regurgitator was originally a 3-piece indie rock band with Quan Yeomans (guitar and vocals), Ben Ely (bass and vocals) and Martin Lee (drums). The three had purportedly met on a bus in inner Brisbane. At this time, all three were already in several bands - Pangaea, Zooerastia, Precision Oiler, Brazilia among others. Regurgitator at this time was not considered to be the main focus of any members, rather as a side-project to their other bands.

The band released its debut self-titled EP in October 1994. With the emergence of Brisbane&#x27;s underground music scene in the early 1990s, major labels, such as Warner Music Group, took the initiative to expand its Australian music roster. A&amp;R representative Michael Parisi initially pursued Pangaea, a popular and established band in Brisbane&#x27;s underground that Ben Ely fronted. It wasn&#x27;t until Parisi was supplied with Pangaea recordings by their manager Paul Curtis that he discovered Regurgitator, whose material was also presented as part of a potential Valve label P&amp;D deal. Ironically, Parisi would push for the less-established band to be signed because &quot;it was the hook that Pangaea, for all the excitement [it] had generated on stage, had lacked.&quot;

The band signed with Warner early in 1995, who re-released its debut EP in February 1995, which charted at number 45 on the ARIA singles chart. Regurgitator quickly released another EP, titled &quot;New&quot;, which featured radio hits &quot;Track 1&quot; and &quot;Blubber Boy&quot;. &quot;New&quot; peaked at number 30 on the ARIA singles chart.

===1996: &quot;Tu-Plang&quot;===

Following the success of their first two EPs, the band made an unusual move by travelling to Thailand to record their first full-length album. Made on a comparatively small budget at a famed pop studio in Bangkok, &quot;Tu-Plang&quot; (ตู้เพลง; Thai for &#x27;Jukebox&#x27;), largely featured a mixture of rock and hip hop, which was particularly evident on its third single release &quot;Kong Foo Sing&quot;. The band also experimented in a number of genres including techno, musak, surf rock and dub. Yeomans gained notoriety for his uniquely cynical and obscene lyrical style, most notably the controversial pop-rock tune &quot;I Sucked a Lot of Cock to Get Where I Am&quot;, which was attacked by Australian radio identity Alan Jones, who campaigned to have it removed from airplay. &quot;Tu-Plang&quot; peaked at number 3 on the ARIA Charts, was certified platinum and won Best Alternative Release and Breakthrough Artist at the ARIA Music Awards of 1996.

===1997–1998: &quot;Unit&quot;===

The band recorded their second studio album in a warehouse in Brisbane which they affectionately named &quot;The Dirty Room&quot;. In contrast with their rock-oriented works of the past, the band moved on with a more electronic and pop based sound. The band openly acknowledged their stylistic change with the album&#x27;s opening track, ironically titled &quot;I Like Your Old Stuff Better Than Your New Stuff&quot;. The band released &quot;Everyday Formula&quot; as the first single, with Yeomans and Magoo later admitting it was a conscious decision to ease their fans into the new sound with a heavier track. The single release in October 1997 peaked at number 41 on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Unit&quot; was released in November and peaked at number 4 on the ARIA Charts. &quot;Black Bugs&quot;, &quot;Polyester Girl&quot; and &quot;! (The Song Formerly Known As)&quot; (an homage to 1980s era Prince) were all released as singles and gained significant amounts of airplay. &quot;Unit&quot; is Regurgitator&#x27;s most commercially successful album, going platinum three times in Australia. Whilst it no doubt increased the popularity of the band, fans of their first generation of work are still divided in their responses to it.

During the Unit tour in late 1997 drummer Martin Lee had failed to appear at a show at the University of Western Australia. After disappearing from a Perth nightclub, he was found the next day, unconscious, and was taken to hospital where he remained comatose for a week. No-one, including Lee once he had recovered, had any recollection of the circumstances that had landed him there. Jon Coghill of Brisbane rock band Powderfinger was his fill-in for the rest of the tour, though the arrangement purportedly caused a rift between the two bands as Coghill and Lee were high school friends and, as Yeomans explained in a 2011 interview, &quot;...those guys (Powderfinger) are kind of from a different scene I guess, if you like. Almost a different social strata in a weird way; they&#x27;re all private school boys so we never had that much in common&quot;.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1998, &quot;Unit&quot; won 5 Awards, including Album of the Year and Producer of the Year.

===1999–2000: &quot;...art&quot; and Martin Lee&#x27;s departure===

After a short break in 1998 working with respective side projects (Quan formed Happyland with Spiderbait&#x27;s Janet English and Ben Ely revived Pangaea) the band moved into Wategoes Beachhouse at Byron Bay on the New South Wales coast to begin recording their third album, &quot;...art&quot;, which was released in August 1999 and peaked at number 2 on the ARIA Chart. Having rebuilt &quot;The Dirty Room&quot; studio with the assumption it would be used for the recording, Lee felt undervalued when Yeomans made it clear he needed a change in working environment. Ely admitted that tension had always existed between the two. Since the &quot;Unit&quot; sessions he had felt excluded from the creative process as his material would rarely be used and he was often replaced by a drum machine in the studio. After an extended absence during the album recording and a string of absences on the supporting tour schedule it was announced in late 1999 that Lee would be leaving the group due to &#x27;creative differences&#x27;. He formed The Boat Show with Matthew Strong of Custard when Custard disbanded. Lee was replaced by Front End Loader and Hard-Ons drummer, Peter Kostic in late 1999.

===2001–2003: &quot;Eduardo and Rodriguez Wage War on T-Wrecks&quot; and &quot;Jingles&quot;===

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Eduardo and Rodriguez Wage War on T-Wrecks&quot; was released in July 2001; a hip-hop-focused album that Yeomans and Ely recorded and produced in London. At this time, a turbulent relationship commenced with the Warner label who were unable to grasp the band&#x27;s lack of motivation and refusal to compromise for the sake of commercial success. After the fourth album, discussions led to a mutual request to end the deal, and the compilation album &quot;Jingles&quot; was released.

===2004–2005: Band in a Bubble and &quot;Mish Mash!&quot; and &quot;#?*!&quot;===

In 2004, Regurgitator created and participated in the &quot;Band in a Bubble&quot; project; a new reality TV-inspired media stunt sponsored and broadcast by Australian music channel, Channel V. The band entered a small glass recording studio, built in Federation Square in the centre of Melbourne, to record their new album; their first on new label Valve Records. Pedestrians could look into most rooms of the &quot;bubble&quot; and could watch the band work, or tune into a 24-hour digital cable television channel and watch their work on that. Nobody could enter or leave the bubble, a la &quot;Big Brother&quot;. In addition to the three band members, their longtime Australian producer Magoo, engineer Hugh Webb and Channel V host Jabba were all also locked into the bubble with the band.

The first single from the session was released in October 2004 as &quot;The Drop&quot; and the album, &quot;Mish Mash!&quot; was released in November 2004 and it peaked at number 52 on the ARIA Charts.

In August 2005, the band released the &quot;#?*!&quot; (or &quot;Pillowhead&quot;) EP which contained B-sides from &quot;Mish Mash!&quot;.

===2006: Break===
Regurgitator took a break in 2006, during which time Ely began working on his project Jump 2 Light Speed and Yeomans worked on establishing a solo career. The band also licensed their &quot;Band in a Bubble&quot; concept to Initial TV in the UK. In 2007, Yeomans released an EP with Sydney-based musician Spod called Blox.

===2007–2010: &quot;Love and Paranoia&quot; and &quot;Distractions&quot;===

In 2007, the band reunited and recorded their sixth album in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. &quot;Love and Paranoia&quot; was released in Australia on 15 September 2007 and peaked at number 74. It features 80s style keyboard-driven poprock tunes, with new member Seja Vogel on keyboards. Two singles were released from the album, &quot;Blood and Spunk&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Damned&quot;.

In 2008, Regurgitator supported the album with a tour of UK and Asia. It was the first time in 5 years that the band had toured the UK. Simultaneously, Ben Ely and Quan Yeomans both launched solo projects with &quot;Ben Ely&#x27;s Radio 5&quot; becoming his second solo project while Yeomans&#x27;s album &quot;Quan: The Amateur&quot; was his debut solo album which was recorded in Hong Kong.

At the beginning of May 2010, Regurgitator announced on the news section of their website that they had begun work on new music and would release music &#x27;as they go along&#x27; instead of an album. 
In August 2010, the band released the single &quot;Making No Sense&quot; and in September, a four-track EP titled &quot;Distractions&quot;. In December 2010, the band released another single titled, &quot;Nrob Bmud&quot;.

===2011–2013: &quot;Super Happy Fun Times Friends&quot; and &quot;Dirty Pop Fantasy&quot;===

In July 2011, the band released &quot;One Day&quot;, the lead single from their seventh studio album &quot;Super Happy Fun Times Friends&quot; in August 2011. The album debuted on the AIR chart at No. 18 and the ARIA chart at No. 91.

In June 2012, it was announced that Regurgitator would be playing their first two albums, &quot;Tu Plang&quot; and &quot;Unit&quot;, in their entirety in an Australian tour named &quot;RetroTech&quot;.

In early 2013, the band announced that they were working on their eighth studio album in Hong Kong. Entitled &quot;Dirty Pop Fantasy&quot;, the album was released on 6 September 2013 through Valve Records. The album was streamed online on 23 August 2013 on the Deezer website. During the band&#x27;s keynote address at the Big Sound music conference in early September 2013, the band explained that the lower level of productivity during the latter part of their career is due to the geographical spread of the two primary band members, Ely and Yeomans—Ely is based in Melbourne, Australia, while Yeomans resides in Hong Kong. A post on the band&#x27;s Facebook page on 18 September 2013 then revealed that Regurgitator will enter a period of indefinite hiatus following a national Australian and Asian tour that ended in December 2013 due to the birth of Yeomans&#x27;s first child. Their last show for the foreseeable future was in Beijing on 7 December 2013 as part of the Converse Rubber Tracks event with touring friends Chinese band New Pants.

===2014–2018: Hiatus and &quot;HEADROXX&quot;===

In May 2015, following an 18 month hiatus commencing in September 2013, Regurgitator announced their Cheap Imitations tour-ché across Australia from August to September 2015.

In April 2016, they performed at the National Gallery of Victoria covering Velvet Underground&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; as part of the Andy Warhol-Ai Weiwei exhibition. Regurgitator&#x27;s line-up was Yeomans, Ely, Kostic and joined by Seja Vogel on keyboards/vocals and Mindy Meng Wang on guzheng. In homage to Prince, they added a cover of his song, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; to their set list on 22 April.

In October 2017, Regurgitator performed a special one-off show at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre as a part of EB Games Expo, celebrating the 20th anniversary of their 1997 album Unit. The concert was also filmed and was later released on DVD in 2019.

2018 saw the release of the band&#x27;s 9th studio album, &quot;Headroxx&quot;.

===2019-2023: Regurgitator&#x27;s Pogogo Show, &quot;Quarter Pounder&quot; and Touring===

In 2019, the group announced their new children&#x27;s music spin-off project &quot;Regurgitator&#x27;s Pogogo Show&quot;. Their debut offering, &quot;The Really Really Really Really Boring Album&quot; was released on 1 March 2019. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2019, &quot;The Really Really Really Really Boring Album&quot; was nominated for Best Children&#x27;s Album.

In October 2019, the group released a best of album titled &quot;Quarter Pounder: 25 Years of Being Consumed&quot;, alongside a national tour. In May 2023, Regurgitator toured around Australia for 25 years of &quot;Unit&quot;, with Custard, DZ Deathrays, Butterfingers &amp; Glitoris. In October of that same year, they opened for Weezer for their two headlining Australian shows in early October 2023. The two bands also supported Kiss at their last Australian concert at Accor Stadium in Sydney.

===2024–present: &quot;Invader&quot;===

In 2024, Regurgitator announced their 11th studio album &quot;Invader&quot;. A supporting tour began soon after the album&#x27;s release. The &quot;It&#x27;s So Invasive Tour&quot; started in Hobart, Tasmania, and ended in Cairns, Queensland, with 23 dates. Supporting acts across the tour included Party Dozen, the Subculture Clique, Displeasure, Cry Club, Wolfpack, Monster Zoku Onsomb!, and Dubbzone.

<text>Design for Living is a comedy play written by Noël Coward in 1932. It concerns a trio of artistic characters, Gilda, Otto and Leo, and their complicated three-way relationship. Originally written to star Lynn Fontanne, Alfred Lunt and Coward, it was premiered on Broadway, partly because its risqué subject matter was thought unacceptable to the official censor in London. It was not until 1939 that a London production was presented.

&quot;Design for Living&quot; was a success on Broadway in 1933, but it has been revived less often than Coward&#x27;s other major comedies. Coward said, &quot;it was liked and disliked, and hated and admired, but never, I think, sufficiently loved by any but its three leading actors.&quot; The play was adapted into a film in 1933, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, with a screenplay by Ben Hecht, and starring Fredric March, Gary Cooper, and Miriam Hopkins. The play was first seen in London in 1939 and has enjoyed a number of stage revivals.

==Background and first production==
Coward had known Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne since his first trip to New York in 1921, when he was penniless and they were scarcely better off. Dreaming of future stardom, they resolved that when all three were famous Coward would write a play for them all to star in. In the following decade, Coward became one of the world&#x27;s most famous playwrights, with a succession of popular hits. These ranged from the operetta &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1929) and the extravaganza &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1931), to the intimate comedies &quot;Hay Fever&quot; (1924) and &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1930). Lunt and Fontanne too had achieved fame, and by the early 1930s the time was right for Coward to write their star vehicle.

The Lunts&#x27; marriage was devoted and long-lived, but there were triangular relationships in their private lives which Coward could draw on for his plot. Coward recorded that while he was refining his original ideas for the play, &quot;Alfred had suggested a few stage directions which if followed faithfully, would undoubtedly have landed all three of us in gaol&quot;. Of the three principal characters, Coward later commented,

&quot;Design for Living&quot; previewed in Cleveland, Ohio on 2 January 1933 and opened in New York on 24 January, at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on Broadway to popular and critical acclaim. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks Atkinson described it as a play of &quot;skill, art and clairvoyance, performed by an incomparable trio of comedians. ... Miss Fontanne with her slow, languorous deliberation, Mr Lunt with his boyish enthusiasm, Mr Coward with his biting, nervous clarity. ... Skill, art, even erudition of a sort have gone into this gay bit of drollery.&quot; The &quot;New York Sun&quot; called it &quot;as happy a spectacle of surface skating as one might see,&quot; adding that the skaters were &quot;sometimes on very thin ice.&quot; For the opening night, the price of tickets more than quintupled, and the three stars were reported to be receiving record salaries for a Broadway production.

&quot;Design for Living&quot; was such a success that Coward was prevailed upon to relax his usual rule against appearing in any production for more than three months, and he allowed the play to run for a total of five months. So great were the crowds of fans in the street that special police had to be called in during the last week of the run. The notoriety of the play inspired a Broadway parody, &quot;Life Begins at 8:40&quot;, sung by Luella Gear, Ray Bolger and Bert Lahr:

==Plot==

===Act I===
; Otto&#x27;s &quot;rather shabby&quot; studio in Paris, 1932

Gilda is an interior designer who lives with the painter Otto, who was previously attached to Leo, an author. She is visited by Ernest Friedman, an art dealer and friend of all three. He is excited about his newly acquired Matisse and wants to show it to Otto. Gilda says that Otto is in bed, ill, and cannot be disturbed. Ernest tells her that Leo is back in Paris after making a success in New York. Otto enters from the street, carrying luggage, and very clearly not bedridden as Gilda has told Ernest. Ernest prudently takes his leave. After he and Otto have gone out to find Leo, supposedly at the George V Hotel, Leo enters from Gilda&#x27;s bedroom where he has spent the night with her. They discuss what they should say to Otto, whom they both love. On his return they tell him that they have slept together in his absence, and after a furious row he renounces both of them and storms out of the room.

===Act II===
;Leo&#x27;s flat in London eighteen months later

;Scene 1

Leo and Gilda are now living together. His plays are now immensely successful. A journalist and press photographer call to do a feature on him. During the interview Leo makes several remarks that show how shallow he finds success.

;Scene 2

A few days later, Leo is away, and Otto turns up. He too has now become successful. Otto and Gilda dine together and their old love is rekindled. They embrace passionately.

Scene 3

The next morning, Otto is still asleep when Ernest calls on Gilda. She tells him she is leaving Leo, and they exit together. Leo returns to discover Otto, who at once acknowledges that he has spent the night with Gilda. Before the ensuing row develops too far they spot the notes Gilda has left for them both. They are both horrified that she has gone, and they drown their sorrows in brandy and then sherry. They embrace, sobbing helplessly.

===Act III===
;Ernest&#x27;s penthouse in New York, two years later.

;Scene 1
Gilda has married Ernest and become a commercially successful designer. Ernest is away, and Gilda is giving a reception for some important clients. It is gatecrashed by Otto and Leo, in impeccable evening dress, determined to reclaim her. They frighten her guests into leaving, and Gilda pretends to bid them goodnight along with her other guests, but secretly gives them a key and tells them to return later.

;Scene 2
Ernest returns the next morning to find Otto and Leo in his apartment, wearing his pyjamas. Gilda, however, has not been there. She has been to a hotel overnight to allow herself time to think. When she returns, Otto and Leo explain to an incredulous and incandescent Ernest that Gilda&#x27;s formal status as his wife is irrelevant. She slowly realises that the attraction the two exert for her is irresistible. As Ernest rushes out denouncing their &quot;disgusting three-sided erotic hotch-potch,&quot; Gilda, Otto and Leo fall together on a sofa in gales of laughter.

==Revivals and adaptations==

===Theatre===
The first London production of &quot;Design for Living&quot; opened at the Haymarket Theatre on 25 January 1939, later transferring to the Savoy Theatre, and running for 233 performances. The run was cut short by the outbreak of World War II. Gilda was played by Diana Wynyard, Otto by Anton Walbrook and Leo by Rex Harrison. By the time the play made its delayed debut in London Ivor Brown thought it &quot;very much of its time and already seems a trifle faded. It will not be long before they revive it in costume as a specimen comedy of &#x27;early thirties&#x27; manners.&quot;

The first major revival was at the Phoenix Theatre, London, shortly after Coward&#x27;s death in 1973. Vanessa Redgrave played Gilda, with John Stride and Jeremy Brett as Otto and Leo. In 1982, at the Greenwich Theatre and then the Globe Theatre, Maria Aitken, Gary Bond and Ian Ogilvy played the lead roles.

The first Broadway revival was in 1984 at Circle in the Square Theater, directed by George C. Scott, starring Jill Clayburgh as Gilda, Raul Julia as Leo and Frank Langella as Otto.

A 1994 revival of the play directed by Sean Mathias at the Donmar Warehouse theatre emphasised the sexual overtones of the play. Though the Coward estate had been wary of radical reinterpretations of the plays, the author&#x27;s partner, Graham Payn, attended at least one performance. The production featured Rachel Weisz, Paul Rhys and Clive Owen. It transferred to the West End with Weisz, Rupert Graves and Marcus D&#x27;Amico.

A 2001 Broadway revival, directed by Joe Mantello, starred Alan Cumming as Otto, Jennifer Ehle as Gilda and Dominic West as Leo. This version brought the gay subtext to the fore, and included a kiss between Otto and Leo.

In July 2002 Marianne Elliott directed a production for the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Victoria Scarborough as Gilda, Clarence Smith as Leo and Oliver Milburn as Otto. The Old Vic Theatre, London, staged a revival in 2010, with Tom Burke as Otto, Lisa Dillon as Gilda, and Andrew Scott as Leo.

===Radio and television===
As part of the ITV &quot;Play of the Week&quot; series in August 1964 four Coward plays directed and produced by Joan Kemp-Welch were transmitted, including &quot;Design for Living&quot; with Jill Bennett as Gilda, Daniel Massey as Leo, and John Wood as Otto.

A second television adaptation was broadcast by the BBC in its &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series in May 1979. Rula Lenska played Gilda with Clive Arrindell as Otto and John Steiner as Leo. The director was Philip Saville.

On BBC radio on 27 December 1976, Anna Massey played Gilda, with John Rye as Otto and Martin Jarvis as Leo.

===Cinema===
The play was adapted into a pre-Hays code comedy film in 1933, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, with a screenplay by Ben Hecht, starring Fredric March, Gary Cooper, Miriam Hopkins and Edward Everett Horton. Coward said of the film adaptation, &quot;I&#x27;m told that there are three of my original lines left in the film – such original ones as &#x27;Pass the mustard&#x27;.&quot; The film&#x27;s plot was as follows:

In Paris, Americans, playwright Tom Chambers and artist George Curtis, both fall in love with Gilda, an American commercial artist. She cannot make up her mind which man she loves, so the three decide to live together platonically. At first, the three are friends, but as time goes by, the two men become more competitive. Gilda decides to end the dispute by marrying her employer, Max Plunkett, but finds the marriage dull and stifling. After Tom and George crash a party at the Plunkett mansion, Gilda returns to the two men, and Max agrees to a divorce.

<text>The taifas (from &quot;ṭā&#x27;ifa&quot;, plural &quot;ṭawā&#x27;if&quot;, meaning &quot;party, band, faction&quot;) were the independent Muslim principalities and kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain), referred to by Muslims as al-Andalus, that emerged from the decline and fall of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba between 1009 and 1031. They were a recurring feature of al-Andalus history.

The &quot;taifas&quot; were eventually incorporated by the Almoravid dynasty in the late 11th century and, on its collapse, many &quot;taifas&quot; re-appeared only to be incorporated by the Almohad Caliphate. The fall of the Almohads resulted in a flourishing of the &quot;taifas&quot;, and this was the case despite constant warfare with Christian kingdoms. Taifa kings were wary of calling themselves &quot;kings&quot;, so they took the title of &quot;hajib&quot;, presenting themselves as representatives for a temporarily absent caliph. The &quot;taifa&quot; courts were renowned centres of cultural excellence in which poets, scientists, and other scholars were able to thrive.

Wars between the taifas were common and rulers of Muslim taifas were known to ally with the Iberian Christians (and the North African kingdoms) against European or Mediterranean Christian rulers from outside of al-Andalus. These alliances frequently included payments of large tributes in return for security. Eventually, the taifas of Badajoz, Toledo, Zaragoza, and even Sevilla paid tribute to Alfonso VI. By the end of the 13th century, only one remained, the Emirate of Granada, the rest being incorporated into the Christian states of the north.

==Etymology==
The Arabic term &quot;mulūk al-ṭawāʾif&quot; means &quot;kings of the territorial divisions&quot; or &quot;party kings&quot;. Muslim historians originally used these terms to refer to the Parthian Empire and other regional rulers that succeeded Alexander the Great. That period was treated as an interlude between Alexander&#x27;s conquest of Persia and the formation of the Sasanian Empire. The negative portrayal of the Parthian period by Muslim historians may have been inherited from Sasanian propaganda. In the 11th century, Ṣāʿid al-Andalusī first applied the term to the regional rulers who appeared after the collapse of Umayyad power in Spain, &quot;whose condition was like that of the &quot;mulūk al-ṭawāʾif&quot; of the Persians&quot;. The phrase implied cultural decline.

The corresponding term in Spanish is &quot;reyes de taifas&quot; (&quot;kings of &quot;taifas&quot;&quot;), by way of which the Arabic term has entered English (and French) usage.

==Rise==

The origins of the taifas must be sought in the administrative division of the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba, as well in the ethnic division of the elite of this state, divided among Arabs, Berbers, Muladíes (indigenous Muslim converts, a significant majority) and the Saqaliba, Eastern European former slaves. The most secure rulers were governors of frontier provinces, such as the “Farthest Frontier” of Zaragoza; since these regions had been ruled by families for generations prior to the fall of the caliphate, there was minor immediate impact when the caliphate fell.

During the late 11th century, the Christian rulers of the northern Iberian peninsula set out to retake the lands of the former Visigothic Kingdom that had been conquered by Muslims. By this time the caliphate of Cordova, among the richest and most powerful states in Europe, had suffered a civil war, known as the Fitna of al-Andalus. As a result, it &quot;broke into &quot;taifas&quot;, small rival emirates fighting among themselves&quot;.

However, the political decline and chaos was not immediately followed by cultural decline. To the contrary, intense intellectual and literary activity grew in some of the larger taifas.

There was a second period when taifas arose, toward the middle of the 12th century, when the Almoravid rulers were in decline.

During the heyday of the taifas, in the 11th century and again in the mid 12th century, their &quot;emirs&quot; (rulers) competed among themselves, not only militarily but also for cultural prestige. They tried to recruit the most famous poets and artisans.

==Decline==

Observers in al-Andalus in the 1080s did not see a decline as likely, much less imminent or probable. However, by the 1090s, popular revolt became a real possibility as the &quot;ulama&quot; accusations against &quot;taifa&quot; kings gained popularity.

Reversing the trend of the Umayyad period, when the Christian kingdoms of the north often had to pay tribute to the Caliph, the disintegration of the Caliphate left the rival Muslim kingdoms much weaker than their Christian counterparts, particularly the Castilian–Leonese monarchy, and many had to submit to them, paying tributes known as &quot;parias&quot;.

Due to their military weakness, &quot;taifa&quot; princes appealed for North African warriors to come fight Christian kings on two occasions. The Almoravid dynasty was invited after the fall of Toledo (1085), and the Almohad Caliphate after the fall of Lisbon (1147). Warriors of the &quot;taifas&quot; took part in the Battle of Sagrajas, which resulted in the defeat of the Christians. Nevertheless, the Almoravids and the Almohads did not help the &quot;taifa&quot; emirs but rather annexed their lands to their own North African empires.

In the 1100s, the remnants of the &quot;taifa&quot; dynasties in al-Andalus would join forces with Christian powers as a last attempt to shift momentum back in their favor against the Almoravids.

Certain &quot;taifas&quot; hired Christian mercenaries to fight neighbouring realms (both Christian and Muslim). The most dynamic taifa, which conquered most of its neighbours before the Almoravid invasion, was Seville, which ironically was also the first of the major taifas to fall, followed (somewhat quickly) by Badajoz, Valencia and Zaragoza. Zaragoza was also very powerful and expansive, but inhibited by the neighbouring Christian states of the Pyrenees. Zaragoza, Toledo, and Badajoz had previously been the border military districts of the Caliphate.

==List of taifas==
===First period (11th century)===
After the fall of the Caliphate of Cordoba in 1031 about 33 independent taifas emerged out the civil war and conflict in al-Andalus. Many of the less tenable &quot;taifa&quot; kingdoms had disappeared by the 1030s, having been taken over by more powerful neighboring &quot;taifas&quot;. The strongest and largest taifas in this first period (11th century) were the Taifa of Zaragoza, Taifa of Toledo, Taifa of Badajoz and the Taifa of Seville. The most notable taifa to conquer most of its weak neighbours was the Taifa of Seville under the Abbadid dynasty.

<text>Envoi or envoy in poetry is used to describe:

* A short stanza at the end of a poem such as a ballad, used either to address an imagined or actual person or to comment on the preceding body of the poem.
* A dedicatory poem about sending the book out to readers, a postscript.
* Any poem of farewell, including a farewell to life.

The word &quot;envoy&quot; or &quot;l&#x27;envoy&quot; comes from the Old French, where it means &#x27;[the] sending forth&#x27;. Originally it was a stanza at the end of a longer poem, which included a dedication to a patron or individual, similar to a tornada. More recent examples are dedicatory poems as part of a collection, or an individual poem about farewell or moving on. Envoi is both a type of poem, and is often used as a title.

==Form==
The envoi is relatively fluid in form. In ballades and chant royal, envois have fewer lines than the main stanzas of the poem. They may also repeat the rhyme words or sounds used in the main body of the poem, or even whole lines. The envoi can also be a short lyric poem of any form, usually placed at the end of a poetry collection.

==Origins in medieval France==
The envoi first appears in medieval French, in the songs of the trouvères and troubadours. It developed as an address to the poet&#x27;s beloved or to a friend or patron, and typically expresses the poet&#x27;s hope that the poem may bring them some benefit (the beloved&#x27;s favours, increased patronage, and so on).

In the 14th century, the two main forms used in the new literary French poetry were the ballade, which employed a refrain at first but evolved to include an envoi, and the &quot;chant royal&quot;, which used an envoi from the beginning. The main exponents of these forms were Christine de Pizan and Charles d&#x27;Orléans. In the work of these poets, the nature of the envoi changed significantly. They occasionally retained the invocation of the Prince or abstract entities such as Hope or Love as a cryptonym for an authority figure the protagonists(s) of the poem could appeal to, or, in the some poems by d&#x27;Orléans, to address actual royalty. However, more frequently in the works of these poets the envoi served as a commentary on the preceding stanzas, either reinforcing or ironically undercutting the message of the poem. Jean Froissart, in his adaptation of the troubadour &quot;pastourelle&quot; genre to the &quot;chant royal&quot; form, also employed the envoi. His use, however, is less innovative than that of de Pizan or d&#x27;Orléans. Froissart&#x27;s envois are invariably addressed to the Prince and are used to summarise the content of the preceding stanzas. Since the 14th century, the envoi has been seen as an integral part of a number of traditional poetic forms, including, in addition to the ballade and &quot;chant royal&quot;, the &quot;virelai nouveau&quot; and the sestina.

==Later developments==
In English, poems with envoi have been written by poets as diverse as Austin Dobson, Algernon Charles Swinburne and Ezra Pound. G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc went through a period of adding envois to their humorous and satirical poems.

Using an envoi as a &#x27;sending-out&#x27; poem was already quite typical by the eighteenth and nineteenth century, with poets like Henry Longfellow using the form in the 1890s, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe writing his &#x27;L&#x27;envoi&#x27; which he addressed to the reader. Ezra Pound&#x27;s &#x27;Envoi&#x27; to his longer poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley (1920) begins &quot;Go, dumb-born book&quot;, and thus explicitly gives the &#x27;Envoi&#x27; title to the long-standing genre of writing a farewell poem addressed to the book of poems itself, previously used for example by Edmund Spenser in &quot;The&quot; &quot;Shepheardes Calender&quot; (1579) or Anne Bradstreet in &#x27;The Author to Her Book&#x27; (1650s). Later writers such as William Meredith and Meg Bateman have also written envois of this kind.

The envoi is also often written as a postscript or farewell from the poet as they face death, even if that death might be some distance away. Poets who have written envois in this style include Rudyard Kipling, Willa Cather, James McAuley, the suffragist Emily Davison, and Wyn Griffith.
