<text>Shilshole Bay is the part of Puget Sound east of a line drawn northeasterly from Seattle&#x27;s West Point in the southwest to its Golden Gardens Park in the northeast. On its shores lie Discovery Park, the Lawton Wood section of the Magnolia neighborhood, the neighborhood of Ballard, and Golden Gardens Park. It is home to the Shilshole Bay Marina on Ballard&#x27;s Seaview Avenue N.W. and communicates with the Lake Washington Ship Canal via the Ballard Locks.

The name is derived from the Lushootseed word , which means &quot;threading a needle,&quot; referring to Salmon Bay. The name comes from the extremely narrow passageway through which Salmon Bay flows into Shilshole Bay. The fact that Shilshole Bay is named &quot;Shilshole&quot; is a misnomer. The name only refers to Salmon Bay and the village inside it, however, English speakers applied the name &quot;Shilshole&quot; to the outside bay.

<text>NGC 4631 (also known as the Whale Galaxy or Caldwell 32) is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici about 30 million light years away from Earth. It was discovered on 20 March 1787 by German-British astronomer William Herschel. This galaxy&#x27;s slightly distorted wedge shape gives it the appearance of a herring or a whale, hence its nickname. Because this nearby galaxy is seen edge-on from Earth, professional astronomers observe this galaxy to better understand the gas and stars located outside the plane of the galaxy.

== Starburst and superwind ==

NGC 4631 contains a central starburst, which is a region of intense star formation. The strong star formation is evident in the emission from ionized hydrogen and interstellar dust heated by the stars formed in the starburst. The most massive stars that form in star formation regions only burn hydrogen gas through fusion for a short period of time, after which they explode as supernovae. So many supernovae have exploded in the center of NGC 4631 that they are blowing gas out of the plane of the galaxy. This superwind can be seen in X-rays and in spectral line emission. The gas from this superwind has produced a giant, diffuse corona of hot, X-ray emitting gas around the whole galaxy.

Although no supernovae have been observed in NGC 4631 yet, a luminous red nova, designated AT2021biy, was discovered on 29 January 2021 (type LRN, mag. 18.1).

== Nearby galaxies and galaxy group ==
NGC 4631 has a nearby companion dwarf elliptical galaxy, NGC 4627. NGC 4627 and NGC 4631 together were listed in the &quot;Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies&quot; as an example of a &quot;double galaxy&quot; or a galaxy pair.

NGC 4631 and NGC 4627 are part of the NGC 4631 Group, a group of galaxies that also includes the interacting galaxies NGC 4656 and NGC 4657. However, exact group identification is problematic because this galaxy and others lie in a part of the sky that is relatively crowded. Estimates of the number of galaxies in this group range from 5 to 27, and all studies identify very different member galaxies for this group.

<text>Placetas () is a city in the Villa Clara Province in the center of Cuba; before the change in the country&#x27;s government in 1959 the province was called Las Villas. The town is also known as because of its wild laurel trees. Placetas is also a , one of 13 subdivisions of the Villa Clara Province. Cuba&#x27;s geographical center, Guaracabulla, is located in this municipality.

==History==
Placetas was founded on September 9, 1861 mainly due to the sugar production industry. Nowadays, the main produce of the area is tobacco. The main contribution to its foundation came from Jose Martinez-Fortun y Erles, a Spanish Marques and former colonel in the Spanish Army. The town is located on the Carretera Central road, which cuts through the town. The town&#x27;s position on this road has allowed it to serve as a stop for many travellers. Placetas has grown considerably over the years, being declared a town in 1881 and a city in 1925. In 1879 it was established as its own municipality. Placetas is also known by the great carnavals which take place in July and Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Until the 1977 administrative reform, Placetas was divided into the following barrios: Cabecera (Placetas town proper), Guaracabulla (or Guaracabuya), Hernando, Nazareno, San Andres, Sitio Potrero and Tibisial. Annual celebrations displaying the local pride of each barrio used to take place until the 1990s, when the government stopped them.

==Geography==
Placetas lies southwest of its province, next to the borders with the one of Sancti Spíritus. Nearest towns include Zulueta (to the north), Remedios (to the northeast), Cabaiguán and Fomento (to the east), and Santa Clara and Camajuaní (to the west). The springs of Zaza River, that runs from the outskirts of Placetas to the sea, are located near the town. The river Zaza is currently an environmental preservation area.

The municipality borders with Manicaragua, Santa Clara, Camajuaní, Remedios, Cabaiguán and Fomento. Its territory includes the villages of Báez, Benito Juárez, Carbó Serviá, Falcón, Falero, Guaracabulla, Hermanos Ameijeiras, Manzanares, Máximo, Miller, Nazareno, Oliver and Suazo.

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Placetas had a population of 65,379. With a total area of , it has a population density of . The city proper has a population of 42,000.

==Economy==
The area is primarily a sugar producing region, with three &quot;centrales&quot; sugar producing factories. Placetas also has major railroad industries that operate from its area. Many Placetenos have emigrated to other countries and there are around 2300 people from Placetas residing in the United States, most of them in Miami. This contributes to the high amount of comunitarios that travel to Placetas every month from the United States. Nowadays the town also houses many aluminum factories and is known around Cuba as the capital of aluminum because of the export business. One of the main streets in Placetas is the Primera del Oeste street, which is the corner where Cuba&#x27;s central road and the Parque Casallas meet and houses the popular Rumbos, one of the many touristic places recently opened. This street also houses the underground commerce and business of the town. It is referred to by Placetenos as La Calle 8 de Placetas, in reference to 8th St. in Miami. All sugar mills have closed down, there is no industry and the supermarkets are empty

==Architecture==
The central Catholic church in the town is called San Atanasio de Placetas, after the town&#x27;s patron saint. As of 1996, it had one library, a central post office, three middle-high schools (13 de Marzo, Rodolfo Leon Perlacia and Julio Antonio Mella), one police station and many recreational areas. Most of the downtown structures were built before the 1959 dictatorship of Fidel Castro, and little of the town has been renovated.

==Notable people==

*Miguel Díaz-Canel (b. 1960), President of Cuba since 2018.
*Pepin Garcia (b. 1950), Cuban-American businessman
*Emilio Mola (1887-1937), Spanish-born general and instigator of the Spanish Civil War

<doc id="448312" wikidata="Q1423559" url="?curid=448312" title="Larry King Live">
<text>Larry King Live is an American television talk show broadcast by CNN from June 3, 1985 to December 16, 2010. Hosted by Larry King, it was the network&#x27;s most watched and longest-running program, with over one million viewers nightly.

Mainly aired from CNN&#x27;s Los Angeles studios, the show was sometimes broadcast from the CNN Center in Atlanta, from the Time Warner Center in New York City, or from Washington, D.C., where King had gained national prominence during his years as a radio interviewer on the &quot;Larry King Show&quot; for the Mutual Broadcasting System. Every night, King interviewed one or more prominent individuals, usually celebrities, politicians and businesspeople.

The one-hour show was broadcast three times a day in some areas, and was seen all over the world on CNN International.

On June 29, 2010, King announced that the program would end. The final episode aired on December 16, but a new episode on the war against cancer aired two days later on December 18.

&quot;Larry King Live&quot; was replaced by &quot;Piers Morgan Tonight&quot;, a talk show hosted by British television personality and journalist Piers Morgan, that began airing on January 17, 2011. It was renamed to &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot; in 2013, and ran its last episode on March 28, 2014, after being cancelled. In October 2023, CNN premiered &quot;Laura Coates Live&quot;; while its host Laura Coates described it as a spiritual successor to &quot;Larry King Live&quot; (citing her adoration of King&#x27;s &quot;intimate&quot; style), and uses graphics evoking the look and feel of the show, &quot;Laura Coates Live&quot; utilizes an opinion journalism-based format similar to other CNN primetime programs and is otherwise unrelated.&quot;&quot;

==Format==

===Interview style===
Larry King mainly conducted interviews from the studio, but he also interviewed people on-site in the White House, their prison cells, their homes, and other unique locations. Critics claimed that Larry King asked &quot;soft&quot; questions in comparison to other interviewers, which allowed him to reach guests who would be averse to interviewing on &quot;tough&quot; talk shows. His reputation for asking easy, open-ended questions made him attractive to important figures who wanted to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics. When interviewed on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien,&quot; King said that the secret to a good interview is to get the guest to talk about him- or herself, and to put oneself in the background pool.

A 1996 interview in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; saw King note that he sometimes slips hard questions in between softballs. King prefers one-sentence questions. In interviews, King has also proclaimed that he prepares as little as possible for each program, does not read the books of the authors he interviews, and admitted that the show was not journalism but &quot;infotainment&quot;. He said that he tries to project an image of earnestness and sincerity in each interview, and the format of the show (King in suspenders instead of suit and tie, sitting directly next to the guest) reinforces that.

In response to softball&#x27; questions&quot; accusations, King says, &quot;I&#x27;ve never understood that. All I&#x27;ve tried to do is ask the best questions I could think of, listen to the answers, and then follow up. I&#x27;ve never not followed up. I don&#x27;t attack anybody – that&#x27;s not my style – but I follow up. I&#x27;ve asked people who say this, &#x27;What&#x27;s a softball question?&#x27; They&#x27;ll say, &#x27;You say to some movie star, what&#x27;s your next project?&#x27; To me, that&#x27;s not a softball. To me, that&#x27;s interesting – what are you doing next?&quot;

===Call-ins===
King accepted call-in questions on some nights. Callers were identified only by city and state/province, and generally not by name. Occasionally, surprise guests telephoned the show and comment, like governors, royalty, and celebrities. At times, prank calls came in.

===Frequent topics===
During major election coverage, the program may center on political analysis and commentary, as the show&#x27;s prime time airing generally coincides with the closing of polls in many states. Larry King would air generally near the end of each hour with various guests during election coverage while hosting a panel at the end of the night which is midnight eastern the usual time slot for the show&#x27;s daily repeat outside of live election coverage.

One of King&#x27;s recurring topics is the paranormal. A frequent guest is John Edward of the popular television show &quot;Crossing Over with John Edward&quot;. Edward comes on the show and gives callers a free chance to supposedly communicate, via him, with their dead loved ones. King also had alleged psychics such as Sylvia Browne and James Van Praagh on from time to time to do readings and discuss the future. King sometimes allows skeptics such as James Randi to debate the psychics. In an April 2005 episode, King hosted a panel discussion regarding Evangelical, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, and atheist views on the afterlife. King has also had topics about UFOs and Extraterrestrials where he goes on to pit them one against the other, believers views on the afterlife against skeptics.

King is also frequently accused of pandering to sensationalist news stories; for instance, the death of Anna Nicole Smith took up much of King&#x27;s shows after the event, causing the cancellation of numerous guests and interviews that were already scheduled, most notably Christopher Hitchens, who had intended to discuss the Iraq situation.

After the death of a prominent celebrity, King would either replay a recent program featuring said celebrity (for instance, after actor Don Knotts&#x27; death in 2006 King replayed the interview with Knotts and Andy Griffith taken several months before) or will bring on family members and close confidantes to the deceased to reminisce on the departed&#x27;s life.

===Set design===
Each studio set features an identical colored-dot map of the world in the background and one of King&#x27;s trademarks, a vintage RCA microphone (as seen in the title card), on the desk. The microphone is a prop, as King and his guests use lapel microphones.

==Notable episodes==

* On June 3, 1985, &quot;Larry King Live&quot; debuted on CNN, with then-Governor of New York Mario Cuomo as King&#x27;s first guest. The legacy of Mario Cuomo as the 52nd Governor of New York led to his being dubbed &quot;Hamlet on the Hudson.&quot;
* In 1990, Minister Louis Farrakhan (the Nation Of Islam leader) appeared as a guest for the first time on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;.
* The November 9, 1993 debate between Ross Perot and Al Gore on the North American Free Trade Agreement was watched in 11.174 million households – the largest audience ever for a program on an ad-supported cable network until the October 23, 2006 New York Giants-Dallas Cowboys game on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.
* On October 7, 1994, actor Marlon Brando was interviewed from his home to promote his autobiography &quot;Songs My Mother Taught Me&quot;. Towards the end, Brando gave a kiss to King on the lips.
* On September 8, 2000, Russian President Vladimir Putin was interviewed. 
* On September 25, 2006, Oprah Winfrey made her first endorsement of Barack Obama for President of the United States on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;. Two economists estimate that Winfrey&#x27;s endorsement was worth over a million votes in the Democratic primary race and that without it, Obama would have lost the nomination.
* To mark the 20th anniversary of the show, ABC&#x27;s Barbara Walters was a guest host and interviewed King on his reflections of his career.
* To mark King&#x27;s 50 years in broadcasting, &quot;Larry King Live&quot; had a week-long celebration that included a two-hour &#x27;CNN Presents&#x27; special and an hour of celebrity toast. The broadcast of this special week-long event was postponed due to the tragedy at Virginia Tech. XM Satellite Radio also featured a micro channel called &quot;Larry!&quot; that featured replays of the show along with interviews and the new material from the CNN anniversary shows.
* On July 19, 2007, a frail Tammy Faye Messner made her final appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; to talk about her battle with lung and colon cancer. She died the following day.

King says his final show was not a &quot;good-bye&quot; but rather a &quot;so long&quot;, as he plans to move on and pursue other things. The final show attracted an audience of 2.24 million people, more than triple the program&#x27;s usual audience of 672,000.

<text>Micheline Ostermeyer (23 December 1922 – 17 October 2001) was a French athlete and concert pianist. She won three medals at the 1948 Summer Olympics in shot put, discus throw, and high jump. After retiring from sports in 1950, she became a full-time pianist for fifteen years and then turned to teaching afterwards.

==Biography==
A great-niece of the French author Victor Hugo and a niece of the composer Lucien Laroche, Ostermeyer was born in Rang-du-Fliers, Pas-de-Calais. At the insistence of her mother, she began learning piano at the age of 4, and at 14 she left her family&#x27;s home in Tunisia to attend the Conservatoire de Paris. After the outbreak of World War II, she moved back to Tunisia where she performed a weekly half-hour piano recital on Radio Tunis.

It was during her return stay in Tunisia that Ostermeyer began participating in sports, competing in basketball and track and field events. After the war, she continued her participation in athletics while resuming her education at the Conservatoire. She competed in a range of contests, eventually winning 13 French titles in running, throwing, and jumping events. In 1946, she placed second in the shot put at the European Athletics Championship in Oslo, as well as winning the Prix Premier at the Conservatoire.

The 1948 Summer Olympics were Ostermeyer&#x27;s finest hour as an athlete. She won gold medals in the shot put and discus throw (despite having picked up a discus for the first time just a few weeks before the event), and a bronze medal in the high jump. She is the first French woman to win an Olympic medal in athletics. Her performance was overshadowed only by that of Dutch Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won four gold medals at the same London Olympiad. After winning the shot put, Ostermeyer concluded the day with an impromptu performance of a Beethoven concert at her team&#x27;s headquarters and a concert at Royal Albert Hall.

She retired from sports in 1950 after having won two bronze medals at that year&#x27;s European Championships and continued to pursue a career in music. Her athletic prowess damaged her reputation as a concert pianist, however, and she even avoided playing anything composed by Franz Liszt for six years because she considered him too &quot;sportif&quot;. She toured for fifteen years before personal commitments, including the death of her husband, led her to take a teaching job, a post she held until her retirement in the early 1980s. In her final years, she emerged from retirement to give a series of concerts in both France and Switzerland before her death in Bois-Guillaume.

At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Ostermeyer was inducted into the Olympians for Life project.

<text>Schloßplatz (, &quot;Palace Square or Castle Square&quot;) is a square located on Museum Island (&quot;Museumsinsel&quot;) in Berlin, Germany. The square was restored in 2017-2023 in connection with the reconstruction of the Berlin Palace (&quot;Berliner Schloss&quot;) as the home of the Humboldt Forum. It measures about 225 m by 175 m, with its long side oriented on an axis approximately southwest/northeast. At its west corner is the Schlossbrücke (Palace Bridge), from which Unter den Linden leads west to the Brandenburg Gate. From the same corner, Karl-Liebknecht-Straße runs northeast alongside the square and on to Alexanderplatz. Until the early 20th century, only the square south of the palace was so named, the square north of it being the &quot;Lustgarten&quot;.

&quot;Schloßplatz&quot; is also a common name for squares in many German-speaking countries. Other cities which have a Schloßplatz include Frankfurt am Main, Stuttgart, Munich and Dresden.

==History==

It was the site of the Berliner Stadtschloss (Berlin City Palace). From 1949 to 1990 it was part of East Berlin, the capital of East Germany. In 1950, the remains of the city palace were blown up, and in 1951 the square was renamed Marx-Engels-Platz (Marx-Engels Square) after Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. New buildings erected included the Palast der Republik, the Council of State building, and the Foreign Ministry building. The Council of State building contains a balcony from the former city palace, where Karl Liebknecht proclaimed a socialist republic on November 9, 1918. The Soviet Army&#x27;s repression of the East German uprising of 1953 began on the square, when Soviet soldiers fired at East Germans trying to climb onto a T-34 tank.

Following German reunification in 1990, the name &quot;Schloßplatz&quot; was restored in 1994.

The Palast der Republik was originally scheduled to be demolished in 2005-06, but this was delayed, and a series of conceptual and performance art events were held in the Palast during the period of reprieve. Demolition of Palast der Republik was completed in 2008.

A temporary exhibition venue Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin was then constructed on the western side of the Schloßplatz and held a number of contemporary art exhibitions over the following two years.

Between 2012 and 2020 the Stadtschloss palace was rebuilt with three replica façades on north, west and south, a replica courtyard, and a modern interior and eastern facade. It houses a conference centre and several museum collections of the Humboldt Forum, which opened online on 16 December 2020.

The music video for the song &#x27;Ich Will&#x27; (I Want) by the German band Rammstein was filmed in this location.

<text>Andrew Verne Marrou (; December 4, 1938) is an American politician who served in the Alaska House of Representatives from the 5th district as a member of the Libertarian Party from 1985 to 1987. He was the Libertarian vice-presidential nominee in the 1988 election and presidential nominee in the 1992 election.

Marrou was born in Nixon, Texas, and educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He lived in Massachusetts until he moved to Alaska in 1973. He joined the Alaska Libertarian Party in 1976, and became its vice chair. He unsuccessfully sought a seat in the state house in 1982, before being elected in 1984, but lost reelection.

==Early life==
Andrew Verne Marrou was born in Nixon, Texas, on December 4, 1938, to Andrew Noil Marrou. He graduated from San Marcos High School and considered becoming a Methodist minister. He was one of the first people to receive a National Merit Scholarship and graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1962. He was given the nickname Andre by French roommates at MIT.

Marrou was a member of the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary in Massachusetts and Civil Air Patrol in Alaska. He lived in Boston until he moved to Alaska in 1973. Marrou joined the Libertarian Party in September 1976 after being handed a brochure in Anchorage. He became vice chair of the Alaska Libertarian Party. He moved to Homer and established a Libertarian affiliate there. They moved onto Perl Island in 1978, before returning to Homer in 1980. In 1986, he moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he worked as a real estate broker.

==Career==
===Alaska House of Representatives===
Marrou ran for Seat B from the 5th district in the Alaska House of Representatives in 1982, but placed second out of three candidates. He was elected to the state house in 1984, after defeating incumbent Republican Representative Milo Fritz by 56 votes. Marrou was the third Libertarian member of the state house after Dick Randolph and Ken Fanning. Marrou spent $21,600 during the campaign, with television advertising costing $10,150. Fritz asked Lieutenant Governor Steve McAlpine to decertify Marrou&#x27;s victory claiming that Marrou knowingly lied on his conflict-of-interest form, but McAlpine declined. Marrou lost reelection to Democratic nominee C.E. Swackhammer in 1986.

Marrou declined to join the Democratic and Republican caucuses. During his tenure in the state legislature he served on the Community and Regional Affairs and Transportation committees. He introduced more bills than any other member of the state house, but only one was passed.

===Vice presidential campaign===
In February 1987, Marrou announced at the Libertarian Party of California&#x27;s state convention that he would seek the party&#x27;s vice presidential nomination. John Vernon nominated Marrou for the presidential nomination, but he declined. Three delegates voted for him on the presidential ballot. Ron Paul won the presidential nomination while Marrou, after being nominated by David Bergland and seconded by Tonie Nathan and Michael Emerling, won the vice presidential nomination. Perry Willis was the chair of Marrou&#x27;s vice-presidential campaign.

Marrou received one write-in vote in the New Hampshire Libertarian vice-presidential primary during the 1996 presidential election. Irwin Schiff won with a plurality of write-in votes.

===Presidential campaign===
Marrou announced his presidential campaign to &quot;LP News&quot; and launched it on November 7, 1990, with James A. Lewis as his campaign manager. He won the Libertarian presidential nomination for the 1992 presidential election at the national convention on August 31, 1991. He wanted a woman to serve as his vice-presidential running mate and favored Mary Ruwart, but she lost the nomination to Nancy Lord.

Marrou spent $30,000 in New Hampshire during the 1992 primary. He won the Libertarian presidential primary without opposition, received 99 write-in votes in the Republican votes, and 70 write-in votes in the Democratic primary. He received more votes in Dixville Notch&#x27;s midnight vote than the winners of the Republican and Democratic primaries. He also won the California and Nebraska primaries without opposition.

Members of Marrou&#x27;s campaign staff resign during the summer of 1992. Several of his former campaign staffers sought to have him removed as the party&#x27;s presidential nominee because he had unpaid child support, could not enter Massachusetts without being arrested for outstanding contempt of court charges, claimed to have been married twice when it was in fact four times, investigated for campaign improprieties from his time in Alaska, was reportedly running up unpaid credit card bills in a campaign PAC&#x27;s name without their approval, and was habitually months late in making his house payments. The national committee decided to take no action for fear it ruin the party&#x27;s reputation.

Marrou meant to participate in a debate in Richmond, Virginia, with Lenora Fulani and a representative for Lyndon LaRouche on October 15. However, he had a commitment in California and was instead represented by Steve Givot.

Marrou wanted to accept matching funds as &quot;it is a moral imperative that we reclaim looted tax money and use it to defend ourselves&quot;. However, he failed to qualify for the funds. He raised $824,168.00 and spent $830,840.00 during the campaign. He placed fourth in the election with 291,628 votes worth 0.28% of the popular vote.

==Personal life==
Marrou divorced four times. He had two sons and adopted one with a wife he divorced in 1971. He married Norma Segal, the former chair of the Libertarian Party of New York. His brother is American television news personality and Judge Chris Marrou.

==Political positions==
Marrou supports abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, Federal Reserve, and income tax. He supports abortion and gay rights. He supported eliminating all border restrictions. He supported repealing the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 and eliminating all tariffs.

Marrou supported limiting members of the Alaska state house and senate to four two-year terms and two four-year terms respectively. He proposed legislation to abolish the Alaska Transportation Commission. He opposed legislation requiring drivers to wear seatbelts.

<doc id="448321" wikidata="Q552456" url="?curid=448321" title="Thermoelectric effect">
<text>The thermoelectric effect is the direct conversion of temperature differences to electric voltage and vice versa via a thermocouple. A thermoelectric device creates a voltage when there is a different temperature on each side. Conversely, when a voltage is applied to it, heat is transferred from one side to the other, creating a temperature difference.

This effect can be used to generate electricity, measure temperature or change the temperature of objects. Because the direction of heating and cooling is affected by the applied voltage, thermoelectric devices can be used as temperature controllers.

The term &quot;thermoelectric effect&quot; encompasses three separately identified effects: the Seebeck effect (temperature differences cause electromotive forces), the Peltier effect (thermocouples create temperature differences), and the Thomson effect (the Seebeck coefficient varies with temperature). The Seebeck and Peltier effects are different manifestations of the same physical process; textbooks may refer to this process as the Peltier–Seebeck effect (the separation derives from the independent discoveries by French physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier and Baltic German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck). The Thomson effect is an extension of the Peltier–Seebeck model and is credited to Lord Kelvin.

Joule heating, the heat that is generated whenever a current is passed through a conductive material, is not generally termed a thermoelectric effect. The Peltier–Seebeck and Thomson effects are thermodynamically reversible, whereas Joule heating is not.

==Origin==
At the atomic scale, a temperature gradient causes charge carriers in the material to diffuse from the hot side to the cold side. This is due to charge carrier particles having higher mean velocities (and thus kinetic energy) at higher temperatures, leading them to migrate on average towards the colder side, in the process carrying heat across the material.

Depending on the material properties and nature of the charge carriers (whether they are positive holes in a bulk material or electrons of negative charge), heat can be carried in either direction with respect to voltage. Semiconductors of n-type and p-type are often combined in series as they have opposite directions for heat transport, as specified by the sign of their Seebeck coefficients.

== Seebeck effect ==

The Seebeck effect is the electromotive force (emf) that develops
across two points of an electrically conducting material when there is a temperature difference between them.
The emf is called the Seebeck emf (or thermo/thermal/thermoelectric emf). The ratio between the emf and temperature difference is the Seebeck coefficient. A thermocouple measures the difference in potential across a hot and cold end for two dissimilar materials. This potential difference is proportional to the temperature difference between the hot and cold ends. First discovered in 1794 by Italian scientist Alessandro Volta, it is named after the Russian born, Baltic German physicist Thomas Johann Seebeck who rediscovered it in 1821.

Seebeck observed what he called &quot;thermomagnetic effect&quot; wherein a magnetic compass needle would be deflected by a closed loop formed by two different metals joined in two places, with an applied temperature difference between the joints. Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted noted that the temperature difference was in fact driving an electric current, with the generation of magnetic field being an indirect consequence, and so coined the more accurate term &quot;thermoelectricity&quot;.

The Seebeck effect is a classic example of an electromotive force (EMF) and leads to measurable currents or voltages in the same way as any other EMF. The local current density is given by

formula_1

where formula_2 is the local voltage, and formula_3 is the local conductivity. In general, the Seebeck effect is described locally by the creation of an electromotive field

formula_4

where formula_5 is the Seebeck coefficient (also known as thermopower), a property of the local material, and formula_6 is the temperature gradient.

The Seebeck coefficients generally vary as function of temperature and depend strongly on the composition of the conductor. For ordinary materials at room temperature, the Seebeck coefficient may range in value from −100 μV/K to +1,000 μV/K (see Seebeck coefficient article for more information).

=== Applications ===

In practice, thermoelectric effects are essentially unobservable for a localized hot or cold spot in a single homogeneous conducting material, since the overall EMFs from the increasing and decreasing temperature gradients will perfectly cancel out. Attaching an electrode to the hotspot in an attempt to measure the locally shifted voltage will only partly succeed: It means another temperature gradient will appear inside of the electrode, so the overall EMF will depend on the difference in Seebeck coefficients between the electrode and the conductor it is attached to.

Thermocouples involve two wires, each of a different material, that are electrically joined in a region of unknown temperature. The loose ends are measured in an open-circuit state (without any current, formula_7). Although the materials&#x27; Seebeck coefficients formula_5 are nonlinearly temperature dependent and different for the two materials, the open-circuit condition means that formula_9 everywhere. Therefore (see the thermocouple article for more details) the voltage measured at the loose ends of the wires is directly dependent on the unknown temperature, and yet totally independent of other details such as the exact geometry of the wires. This direct relationship allows the thermocouple arrangement to be used as a straightforward uncalibrated thermometer, provided knowledge of the difference in formula_5-vs-formula_11 curves of the two materials, and of the reference temperature at the measured loose wire ends.

Thermoelectric sorting functions similarly to a thermocouple but involves an unknown material instead of an unknown temperature: a metallic probe of known composition is kept at a constant known temperature and held in contact with the unknown sample that is locally heated to the probe temperature, thereby providing an approximate measurement of the unknown Seebeck coefficient formula_5. This can help distinguish between different metals and alloys.

Thermopiles are formed from many thermocouples in series, zig-zagging back and forth between hot and cold. This multiplies the voltage output.

Thermoelectric generators are like a thermocouple/thermopile but instead draw some current from the generated voltage in order to extract power from heat differentials. They are optimized differently from thermocouples, using high quality thermoelectric materials in a thermopile arrangement, to maximize the extracted power. Though not particularly efficient, these generators have the advantage of not having any moving parts.

== Peltier effect ==

When an electric current is passed through a circuit of a thermocouple, heat is generated at one junction and absorbed at the other junction. This is known as the Peltier effect: the presence of heating or cooling at an electrified junction of two different conductors. The effect is named after French physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier, who discovered it in 1834. When a current is made to flow through a junction between two conductors, A and B, heat may be generated or removed at the junction. The Peltier heat generated at the junction per unit time is

formula_13

where formula_14 and formula_15 are the Peltier coefficients of conductors A and B, and formula_16 is the electric current (from A to B). The total heat generated is not determined by the Peltier effect alone, as it may also be influenced by Joule heating and thermal-gradient effects (see below).

The Peltier coefficients represent how much heat is carried per unit charge. Since charge current must be continuous across a junction, the associated heat flow will develop a discontinuity if formula_14 and formula_15 are different. The Peltier effect can be considered as the back-action counterpart to the Seebeck effect (analogous to the back-EMF in magnetic induction): if a simple thermoelectric circuit is closed, then the Seebeck effect will drive a current, which in turn (by the Peltier effect) will always transfer heat from the hot to the cold junction. The close relationship between Peltier and Seebeck effects can be seen in the direct connection between their coefficients: formula_19 (see below).

A typical Peltier heat pump involves multiple junctions in series, through which a current is driven. Some of the junctions lose heat due to the Peltier effect, while others gain heat. Thermoelectric heat pumps exploit this phenomenon, as do thermoelectric cooling devices found in refrigerators.

===Applications===

The Peltier effect can be used to create a heat pump. Notably, the Peltier thermoelectric cooler is a refrigerator that is compact and has no circulating fluid or moving parts. Such refrigerators are useful in applications where their advantages outweigh the disadvantage of their very low efficiency.

Other heat pump applications such as dehumidifiers may also use Peltier heat pumps.

Thermoelectric coolers are trivially reversible, in that they can be used as heaters by simply reversing the current. Unlike ordinary resistive electrical heating (Joule heating) that varies with the square of current, the thermoelectric heating effect is linear in current (at least for small currents) but requires a cold sink to replenish with heat energy. This rapid reversing heating and cooling effect is used by many modern thermal cyclers, laboratory devices used to amplify DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR requires the cyclic heating and cooling of samples to specified temperatures. The inclusion of many thermocouples in a small space enables many samples to be amplified in parallel.

== Thomson effect ==
For certain materials, the Seebeck coefficient is not constant in temperature, and so a spatial gradient in temperature can result in a gradient in the Seebeck coefficient. If a current is driven through this gradient, then a continuous version of the Peltier effect will occur. This Thomson effect was predicted and later observed in 1851 by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson). It describes the heating or cooling of a current-carrying conductor with a temperature gradient.
If a current density formula_20 is passed through a homogeneous conductor, the Thomson effect predicts a heat production rate per unit volume.

formula_21

where formula_6 is the temperature gradient, and formula_23 is the Thomson coefficient. The Thomson effect is a manifestation of the direction of flow of electrical carriers with respect to a temperature gradient within a conductor. These absorb energy (heat) flowing in a direction opposite to a thermal gradient, increasing their potential energy, and, when flowing in the same direction as a thermal gradient, they liberate heat, decreasing their potential energy. The Thomson coefficient is related to the Seebeck coefficient as formula_24 (see below). This equation, however, neglects Joule heating and ordinary thermal conductivity (see full equations below).

== Full thermoelectric equations ==

Often, more than one of the above effects is involved in the operation of a real thermoelectric device. The Seebeck effect, Peltier effect, and Thomson effect can be gathered together in a consistent and rigorous way, described here; this also includes the effects of Joule heating and ordinary heat conduction. As stated above, the Seebeck effect generates an electromotive force, leading to the current equation

formula_25

To describe the Peltier and Thomson effects, we must consider the flow of energy. If temperature and charge change with time, the full thermoelectric equation for the energy accumulation, formula_26, is

formula_27

where formula_28 is the thermal conductivity. The first term is the Fourier&#x27;s heat conduction law, and the second term shows the energy carried by currents. The third term, formula_29, is the heat added from an external source (if applicable).

If the material has reached a steady state, the charge and temperature distributions are stable, so formula_30 and formula_31. Using these facts and the second Thomson relation (see below), the heat equation can be simplified to

formula_32

The middle term is the Joule heating, and the last term includes both Peltier (formula_33 at junction) and Thomson (formula_33 in thermal gradient) effects. Combined with the Seebeck equation for formula_20, this can be used to solve for the steady-state voltage and temperature profiles in a complicated system.

If the material is not in a steady state, a complete description needs to include dynamic effects such as relating to electrical capacitance, inductance and heat capacity.

The thermoelectric effects lie beyond the scope of equilibrium thermodynamics. They necessarily involve continuing flows of energy. At least, they involve three bodies or thermodynamic subsystems, arranged in a particular way, along with a special arrangement of the surroundings. The three bodies are the two different metals and their junction region. The junction region is an inhomogeneous body, assumed to be stable, not suffering amalgamation by diffusion of matter. The surroundings are arranged to maintain two temperature reservoirs and two electric reservoirs.

For an imagined, but not actually possible, thermodynamic equilibrium, heat transfer from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir would need to be prevented by a specifically matching voltage difference maintained by the electric reservoirs, and the electric current would need to be zero. For a steady state, there must be at least some heat transfer or some non-zero electric current. The two modes of energy transfer, as heat and by electric current, can be distinguished when there are three distinct bodies and a distinct arrangement of surroundings.

But in the case of continuous variation in the media, heat transfer and thermodynamic work cannot be uniquely distinguished. This is more complicated than the often considered thermodynamic processes, in which just two respectively homogeneous subsystems are connected.

==Thomson relations==

In 1854, Lord Kelvin found relationships between the three coefficients, implying that the Thomson, Peltier, and Seebeck effects are different manifestations of one effect (uniquely characterized by the Seebeck coefficient).

The first Thomson relation is

formula_36

where formula_11 is the absolute temperature, formula_23 is the Thomson coefficient, formula_39 is the Peltier coefficient, and formula_5 is the Seebeck coefficient. This relationship is easily shown given that the Thomson effect is a continuous version of the Peltier effect.

The second Thomson relation is

formula_41

This relation expresses a subtle and fundamental connection between the Peltier and Seebeck effects. It was not satisfactorily proven until the advent of the Onsager relations, and it is worth noting that this second Thomson relation is only guaranteed for a time-reversal symmetric material; if the material is placed in a magnetic field or is itself magnetically ordered (ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, etc.), then the second Thomson relation does not take the simple form shown here.

Now, using the second relation, the first Thomson relation becomes

formula_42

The Thomson coefficient is unique among the three main thermoelectric coefficients because it is the only one directly measurable for individual materials. The Peltier and Seebeck coefficients can only be easily determined for pairs of materials; hence, it is difficult to find values of absolute Seebeck or Peltier coefficients for an individual material.

If the Thomson coefficient of a material is measured over a wide temperature range, it can be integrated using the Thomson relations to determine the absolute values for the Peltier and Seebeck coefficients. This needs to be done only for one material, since the other values can be determined by measuring pairwise Seebeck coefficients in thermocouples containing the reference material and then adding back the absolute Seebeck coefficient of the reference material. For more details on absolute Seebeck coefficient determination, see Seebeck coefficient.

<text>Gaza is a province of Mozambique. It has an area of 75,709 km2 and a population of 1,422,460 (2017 census), which is the least populous of all the provinces of Mozambique. Xai-Xai is the capital of the province. 

Inhambane Province is to the east, Manica Province to the north, Maputo Province to the south, South Africa to the west, and Zimbabwe to the northwest.

==Geography==

Most of the province lies in the basin of the Limpopo River, which runs from northwest to southeast through the province, emptying into the Indian Ocean near Xai-Xai. The Changane River, a tributary of the Limpopo, forms part of the province&#x27;s eastern boundary. The Rio dos Elefantes (Olifants River) flows into the province from the west through the Massingir Dam, to empty into the Limpopo.

The Save River forms the northern boundary of the province.

The Limpopo railway, which connects Zimbabwe and Botswana to the port of Maputo, runs through the province, entering Zimbabwe at the border town of Chicualacuala.

The province, including the towns of Xai-Xai and Chokwe, were greatly affected by the 2000 Mozambique flood amid the month-long heavy rainfall accompanying Cyclone Leon-Eline.

Limpopo National Park lies within the province, bounded by the Olifants and Limpopo rivers and the South African border. Banhine National Park lies in the east-central portion of the province. The Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park and its associated conservation area, which is in the process of being formed, will cover the northern part of the province, including both national parks, and extend into adjacent parts of Mozambique, South Africa, and Zimbabwe.

==Districts==
The province was created on October 20, 1954, when Sul do Save District was divided into the districts of Gaza, Inhambane, and Lourenço Marques (later renamed Maputo). In 1978, Mozambique&#x27;s districts were renamed provinces.

Gaza Province is divided into the 14 districts of:
*Bilene Macia District
*Chibuto District
*Chicualacuala District
*Chigubo District
*Chonguene District
*Mapai District
*Chókwè District
*Guijá District 
*Limpopo District

and the municipalities of:
*Chibuto
*Praia do Bilene
*Chókwè
*Macia
*Manjacaze 
*Xai-Xai

Limpopo District is one of the 14 Districts of Gaza Province. It was carved out of the existing district of Xai-Xai and the District of Bilene Macia in 2016, stretching from the Administrative Post of Chissano to its south and north of the city of Macia on the national EN 1 highway. It includes Administrative Posts of Licilo, Chicumbane and others. To the north, it borders the provincial capital city of Xai Xai on the bank of Limpopo River. The districts lies in the Limpopo Basin.

==Economy==
The province of Gaza is practically rural. It has no industrial economic activities of note. Subsistence farming is the order of the day.

==Transport==
The province is served by the national EN 1 highway.

==Population==
The province has approximately 1,422,460 (as of the 2017 census), with its largest city of Xai-Xai having a population of 116,343. 

==People and education==
The province is inhabited by the Shangaan people. The dominant languages are Shangaan and Portuguese.

Forty percent of the population can read and write. Education in the Gaza province still requires massive investment. Many students still study under the trees.

In February 2025, USAID condoms were falsely reported to have been sent to Gaza Strip whereupon fact-checkers confirmed that the condoms were being sent to the Gaza Province.

<text>Class Action is a 1991 American legal drama film directed by Michael Apted. Gene Hackman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio star; Larry Fishburne, Colin Friels, Fred Dalton Thompson, and Donald Moffat are also featured. The film was entered into the 17th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Plot==

The story is about a lawsuit concerning injuries caused by a defective automobile. The suit takes on a personal dimension because the injured plaintiff&#x27;s attorney, Jedediah Tucker Ward, discovers that the automobile manufacturer&#x27;s attorney is his estranged daughter, Maggie Ward.

Jedediah Ward is a liberal civil rights lawyer who has based his career on helping people avoid being taken for a ride by the rich and powerful; he&#x27;s pursued principle at the expense of profit, though he has a bad habit of not following up on his clients after their cases are settled.

Jed&#x27;s daughter, Maggie, has had a bad relationship with her father ever since she discovered that he was cheating on her mother, Estelle, and while she also has made a career in law, she has taken a very different professional route by working for a high-powered corporate law firm and has adopted a self-interested political agenda.

Jed is hired to help field a lawsuit against ARGO, a major auto manufacturer, whose Meridian station wagons have a dangerous propensity to explode on impact when the left turn signal light is activated. While his research indicates that he has an all but airtight case against them, the case becomes more complicated for him when he discovers that Maggie is representing the firm he&#x27;s suing.

==Cast==

==Production notes==
The central premise of the film is roughly analogous to the controversy surrounding the Ford Pinto and its fuel tank design. A 1977 article in &quot;Mother Jones&quot; alleged Ford was aware of the design flaw, refused to pay for a redesign, and decided it would be cheaper to pay off possible lawsuits. The magazine obtained a cost-benefit analysis that it said Ford had used to compare the cost of repairs (Ford estimated the cost to be $11 per car) against the cost of settlements for deaths, injuries, and vehicle burnouts. The memo in question was actually prepared by Ford in response to a NHTSA request for comment, it reviewed not Ford but the entire new car market and was not used to make product decisions at Ford. The document became known as the &quot;Ford Pinto Memo&quot;.

==Locations==
Scenes of the film were shot in the restaurant of the Beach Chalet in Ocean Beach, San Francisco and show historic 1930s murals of San Francisco life by Lucien Labaudt.

==Reception==
&quot;Class Action&quot; opened at #4 in its opening weekend with $4,207,923 and ended with a domestic gross of $24,277,858; a worldwide total of $28,277,918 was made and the film was a moderate box office success.

The film received generally positive reviews. It holds a 77% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 critics. On Metacritic, it has a score of 58 out of 100 based on reviews from 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<text>San Cristóbal is a city in the southern region of Dominican Republic. It is the municipal (&quot;municipio&quot;) capital of the San Cristóbal province. The municipality is located in a valley at the foothills of the mountains belonging to the Cordillera Central, between the Nigua and Nizao rivers. Within this municipality there is one municipal district (&quot;distrito municipal&quot;): Hato Damas. 

San Cristóbal was founded in the late 16th century. The Constitution of the Dominican Republic was signed in San Cristóbal in 1844. The city is also notable for being the birthplace of Rafael Trujillo, dictator from 1930 to 1961, who was killed by anti-dictatorial Dominicans on his way to San Cristóbal in 1961 as part of a successful plot to end his 30-year authoritarian regime.

==History==
The first explorations in San Cristóbal date back to the beginning of the conquest and colonization of Hispaniola with the second Voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1493. There were various haciendas, herds and ranches that existed in the Partido de los Ingenios de Nigua (today San Cristóbal) during the Spanish colonial era.

The formation of the town is credited to Miguel Díaz. Fleeing from the punishment that awaited him from the authorities of La Isabela (the first city created by Columbus in America), due to a violent fight he had with another colonist, he moved to this place where he married an indigenous woman by the name of Catalina. According to legend, fearing being abandoned by her spouse, she revealed to him the existence of a place where they found gold deposits; Díaz then returned to La Isabela to inform the colonial authorities of his find.

Upon confirming the existence of gold on the banks of the Haina River, the Spanish proceeded to arrange for the settlement of a group of settlers and the installation of a fort called Buenaventura and later San Cristóbal, in honor of the admiral. Between the banks of the Haina and Nigua rivers, herds, haciendas and ranches were formed, as well as sugar mills that contributed to a notable development of the place. The Partido de los Ingenios de Nigua was the name given to the route between the indicated rivers, it was not until 1782 when it was elevated to the category of parish, constituting the San Gregorio de Nigua Church as the seat of the parish, which is undoubtedly one of the oldest construction of San Cristóbal still standing.
Rafael Trujillo, dictator from 1930 to 1961, was born in San Cristóbal in 1891 and had several properties in San Cristóbal among which were:

*El Castillo El Cerro 
*La Casa de Playa de Najayo o Casa de Marfil 
*La Hacienda María o Casa Blanca
*La Casa de Caoba (his favorite home)

All of these buildings are still standing, though in poor conditions. He built many monuments in his hometown, such as Balneario La Toma, and Parque Piedras Vivas – a park he ordered to be built from rocks and stones collected from each city of the Dominican Republic to honor himself (hence the park&#x27;s name &quot;Living Stones&quot;).

==Geography==

San Cristóbal is located about on the DR-2 from Santo Domingo and close to Bajos de Haina. It is located near the coast of the Caribbean Sea. The topography is hilly as you go farther inland into the Cordillera Central mountain range.

However, due to its proximity to Santo Domingo, the population moves to work in the capital city, as well as in the towns of Bajo de Haina and Nigua. Currently in the city they are installing new businesses in its main streets and avenues.

<text>Peter William Brockbanks (15 July 1947 – 7 March 2013), known professionally as Peter Banks, was a British guitarist. He was the original guitarist in the rock bands Yes, Flash, and Empire; he was also a guitarist for The Syn. Banks has been described as &quot;the architect of progressive music&quot;.

==Early life==
Peter William Brockbanks was born in Chipping Barnet in north London, on 15 July 1947, and raised in 37 Alston Road. His father William was an optical mechanic and his mother Ellen a cleaner. He attended Barnet Secondary School, followed by Barnet College of Further Education. Lonnie Donegan was Banks&#x27; first major musical influence and inspired him to take up the guitar at around 8 years of age. His parents bought him his records to listen to as well as his first guitar, an acoustic model which he later said &quot;was practically unplayable&quot;. His first electric guitar was a Gretsch Tennessean. Banks studied art and once had an ambition of becoming a zookeeper, but decided against it when he learned the job had unfavourable hours, and pursued music. Banks also cited guitarist David O&#x27;List and Pete Townshend as an influence in his early period.

==Career==
===Early career and Yes===
Banks started as rhythm guitarist in the Nighthawks, a local group, in 1963. His first gig took place at the New Barnet Pop Festival. In the following year he left to join the Devil&#x27;s Disciples with John Tite on vocals, Ray Alford on bass, and Malcolm &quot;Pinnie&quot; Raye on drums. They recorded two covers on an acetate, Arthur Alexander&#x27;s &quot;You Better Move On&quot; and Graham Gouldman&#x27;s &quot;For Your Love&quot;, which became a hit record for the Yardbirds one year later. It was Banks&#x27; first visit in a recording studio, during which he wore headphones and experienced stereo sound for the first time. He found the experience &quot;totally terrifying&quot;, and was so traumatised that he started having doubts if he could carry on playing the guitar and work in another studio again. In 1965 Banks joined the Syndicats, replacing guitarist Ray Fenwick.
After leaving the Syndicats, Banks joined the Syn which at the time included Chris Squire on bass, Andrew Pryce Jackman on keyboards, Steve Nardelli on vocals, and Gunnar Hákonarson on drums. They recorded two singles, &quot;Created by Clive&quot;/&quot;Grounded&quot; and &quot;Flowerman&quot;/&quot;14 Hour Technicolour Dream&quot;, both in 1967, before they split. Later that year, Banks and Squire joined Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop with Clive Bayley on rhythm guitar and vocals and Bob Hagger on drums. In the spring of 1968 Banks left the band to join Neat Change, with whom he recorded one single, &quot;I Lied to Aunty May&quot;. He was fired from the band after his bandmates wanted to adopt a skinhead look, and Banks refused to cut his hair. Meanwhile, Jon Anderson had joined Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop as lead vocalist, and Hagger was replaced by drummer Bill Bruford. The four entered a period of rehearsals in London, during which Banks replaced a departing Bayley and keyboardist Tony Kaye was brought in to round out the group.

While rehearsing with the new line-up, the band exchanged ideas for a name. Anderson suggested Life and Squire proposed World, but all agreed on Banks&#x27; suggestion of Yes, which he had thought of some time before. Following their debut in August 1968 Banks devised the band&#x27;s first logo, a design featuring the group&#x27;s name inside a speech bubble. Banks performed on the first two Yes albums, &quot;Yes&quot; (1969) and &quot;Time and a Word&quot; (1970). The latter features orchestral arrangements which Banks disagreed with, and he often clashed with producer Tony Colton. On 18 April 1970, Banks was fired from Yes after their gig at the Luton College of Technology, and was replaced by former Syndicats guitarist Steve Howe. In his autobiography, Howe wrote that Banks &quot;was an interesting guitarist to have to follow. He, too, adopted different guitar styles and had already set a scene I could relate to. He was a sweet guy and came to many of our early gigs. I can&#x27;t think of many other ex-band members doing that – I mean, right after they&#x27;ve left the band.&quot;

===Post-Yes career===
====1970s====
Banks joined Blodwyn Pig for around six months in 1970, following the departure of original guitarist Mick Abrahams. He tried to incorporate more arrangements into their simple blues-oriented music, which he later realised did not fit and found his style incompatible. In later years, however, Banks looked back on this period as a particularly happy one and enjoyed working with his bandmates. After the band ran its course, Banks was unsure of his next move and later admitted that he was still &quot;shell-shocked&quot; by his departure from Yes, and turned to alcohol and drugs. He earned some money as a session musician, but found the work restrictive in a creative sense. At one point he was close to bankruptcy, and had to sell some of his equipment. Attempts to form a new band fell through, partly due to his disinterest in being a leader.

Banks&#x27; fortunes changed when music reporter Chris Welch wrote an article about him in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in June 1971. The article was spotted by vocalist Colin Carter, who contacted Banks and invited him to form a band. Following the addition of bassist Ray Bennett and drummer Mike Hough, the four named themselves Flash and began touring in 1972. In the same year they released two albums, &quot;Flash&quot; and &quot;In the Can&quot;, to a warm reception. The group disbanded in 1973 towards the end of a US tour to promote their third album, &quot;Out of Our Hands&quot;. Banks felt the group lacked the right management, and got angry at Carter and Bennett for often playing with their backs to the audience. By this time Banks was a heavy drinker, addicted to valium, and unbeknownst to him until years later, was suffering from his first nervous breakdown.

In 1973 Banks recorded his debut solo album, &quot;Two Sides of Peter Banks&quot;. It was recorded at the same time as &quot;Out of Our Hands&quot;, with Banks working with Flash during the day and travelling to a different studio to work on his own at night. The album features guest appearances from Jan Akkerman of Focus, drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett of Genesis, and John Wetton of King Crimson. In the summer of 1973, Banks played in a short-lived band with Collins, guitarist Ronnie Caryl, violinist Mike Poggott, and bassist John Howitt named Zox and the Radar Boys.

While touring the US with Flash, Banks met his first wife Sidonie Jordan (known as Sidney Foxx). In 1974, they formed Empire and recorded three albums with various musicians until 1979, which remained unreleased until the 1990s. Amongst the musicians involved were Collins, Preston Heyman, bassist John Giblin, and keyboardist Jakob Magnusson. Ray Bennett of Flash was in the group for a period, but he and Banks did not get along and Banks caught Jordan having an affair with him. Empire disbanded in 1980, having only performed showcase gigs for record executives.

====1980s–1990s====
Banks made a steady living in the 1980s and 1990s as a session musician in Los Angeles, which he enjoyed over time. He played on various albums including those by Lonnie Donegan and Jakob Frímann Magnússon, and appeared on &quot;Romeo Unchained&quot; (1986) by Tonio K. He also worked with Ian Wallace in The Teabags with Jackie Lomax, Kim Gardner, David Mansfield, and Mel Collins. No recordings came out of that.

In May 1991, Kaye invited Banks to play with Yes on stage during the encore at their show at the Great Western Forum, California. Banks accepted and went to the show, but Kaye informed him that Howe did not want Banks to play. An angered Banks proceeded to drink at the arena bar with comedian Billy Connolly. In 1994 and 1998, Banks was a featured guest at the Yes fan convention Yestival. He co-ordinated the release of the 1997 live compilation &quot;Something&#x27;s Coming: The BBC Recordings 1969–1970&quot;, and wrote about his days with the band in the liner notes. Around this time, Banks and Geoff Downes played some sessions and the possibility of Banks joining Asia was mooted, but came to nothing. Banks was featured in the 2006 Yes documentary &quot;Classic Artists: Yes&quot; and the 2009 DVDs &quot;The Lost Broadcasts&quot; and &quot;Rock of the &#x27;70s&quot;.

After returning to London in the mid-1990s, Banks continued as a session musician and released archive material. He released three solo albums: the all-instrumental &quot;Instinct&quot; (1993), &quot;Self Contained&quot; (1995), which features Gerald Goff on keyboards, and &quot;Reduction&quot; (1997). Another archival release was &quot;Psychosync&quot;, a live Flash recording made in 1973 for the King Biscuit Flower Hour and finally released in 1998.

====2000s–2010s====
In 2000, Banks put out a collection of his oldest recordings, many previously unreleased, called &quot;Can I Play You Something?&quot;. It features early recordings by The Syn, Mabel Greer&#x27;s Toyshop and Yes.

In 2001, Banks published a book with co-author Billy James, entitled &quot;Beyond and Before: The Formative Years of Yes&quot;. In 2006, he expressed a desire to write a second book.

He was initially involved in a reunion of The Syn in 2003 and 2004, and recorded material with Steve Nardelli, Martyn Adleman, and Gerard Johnson. After several clashes over the recording, production and mixing, Banks was let go from the project, although he claimed he was never officially told. In a statement posted online, Banks called the behaviour of the three members &quot;mystifying&quot; and refuse to discuss the matter with him. Later in 2004 Banks entered talks with former Flash bandmates Colin Carter and Ray Bennett about a reunion, but he fell out with them and was excluded.

In 2004, Banks formed Harmony in Diversity, an improvisational trio with Andrew Booker and Nick Cottam of the music duo Pulse Engine. They released one album, &quot;Trying&quot;. Booker left and was replaced by David Speight. Banks formed a second version of the group named Harmony in Diversity II, featuring himself and keyboardist Gonzalo Carrera. The pair worked together in a jazz fusion project named Self-Contained.

In Gibson Guitar&#x27;s &quot;Lifestyle&quot; e-magazine o February 2009, Banks is listed as one of the &quot;10 Great Prog Rock Guitarists&quot;. According to the article, &quot;Before there was Steve Howe, there was Peter Banks. Artistic differences between Banks and singer Jon Anderson prompted Banks&#x27;s departure from Yes in 1970, but in his little-known &#x27;70s band, Flash, Banks used an ES-335 to create several should-have-been prog rock classics. &quot;Lifetime&quot;, from Flash&#x27;s &quot;In the Can&quot; album, is his tour-de-force.&quot;

In 2018, a documentary film on Banks&#x27; life and career written and directed by Heidi Hornbacher was in production, entitled &quot;Claiming Peter Banks&quot;.

==Personal life and death==
Banks&#x27; first marriage was to American singer and musician Sidonie Jordan (known as Sidney Foxx). They first met in 1974 and co-formed Empire, and divorced in 1985. Banks moved to Los Angeles, California in 1976. In 1996, Banks left the US for his childhood home in Barnet, north London, to care for his ailing father. In 1999, he married Peruvian-born Cecilia Quino Rutte. Although Banks found married life &quot;fantastic&quot; at one point, his second marriage ended in a divorce by the early 2000s due to the effects of his medication to treat his depression, which his friends said made him difficult to live with. A longtime friend said he also went through seasonal &quot;dark&quot; periods around February and March.

In 2011, Banks was hospitalised with a case of septicaemia, likely caused from an infected tooth due to dental neglect. He also caught Legionnaires&#x27; disease. During this time his doctors discovered a cancerous tumour. Banks died on 7 March 2013 in his rented flat where he grew up in Chipping Barnet, London, aged 65. He failed to turn up for a scheduled recording session, and a concerned friend had medical staff break into his home, where his body was discovered. The coroner declared that he died from heart failure. His former business partner and manager George Mizer, who he first met in the 1970s, organised Banks&#x27; posthumous business affairs, and discovered that Banks&#x27; body was unclaimed in the local mortuary. As Banks had no children or a will, Mizer reached out to Quino, who gave the required approval for the body to be released. There was no money to pay for a funeral or wake, so Mizer setup an online fund for fans to contribute. Banks was cremated, after which several friends and associates, including David Cross of King Crimson and original Yes manager Roy Flynn, met for a memorial drink in Denmark Street. Mizer kept the ashes, and sprinkled some in areas that meant something to Banks.

<text>Ulex (commonly known as gorse, furze, or whin) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. The genus comprises about 20 species of thorny evergreen shrubs in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae. The species are native to parts of western Europe and northwest Africa, with the majority of species in Iberia.

Gorse is closely related to the brooms, and like them, it has green stems, very small leaves and is adapted to dry growing conditions. However, it differs from the brooms in its extreme thorniness, the shoots being modified into branched thorns long, which almost wholly replace the leaves as the plant&#x27;s functioning photosynthetic organs. The leaves of young plants are trifoliate, but in mature plants, they are reduced to scales or small spines. All the species have yellow flowers, generally showy, some with a very long flowering season.

==Species==
The greatest diversity of &quot;Ulex&quot; species is found in the Atlantic portion of the Iberian Peninsula, and most species have narrow distribution ranges. The most widespread species is the common gorse (&quot;Ulex europaeus&quot;): it&#x27;s the only species native to much of western Europe, where it grows in sunny sites and usually on dry, sandy soils. It is also the largest species, reaching in height; this compares with typically heights for the western gorse (&quot;Ulex gallii&quot;). This latter species is characteristic of highly exposed Atlantic coastal heathland and montane habitats. In the eastern part of Great Britain, the dwarf furze (&quot;Ulex minor&quot;) replaces the western gorse. &quot;Ulex minor&quot; grows to a height of approximately , a habit characteristic of sandy lowland heathlands.
Common gorse flowers a little in late autumn and through the winter, coming into flower most strongly in spring. Western gorse and dwarf furze flower in late summer (August–September in Ireland and Great Britain). Between the different species, some gorse is nearly always in flower, hence the old country saying: &quot;When gorse is out of blossom, kissing&#x27;s out of fashion&quot;. Gorse flowers have a distinctive coconut-like scent, experienced very strongly by some individuals but only weakly by others.

* &quot;Ulex cantabricus&quot; 
* &quot;Ulex densus&quot; 
* &quot;Ulex erinaceus&quot; 
* &quot;Ulex eriocladus&quot; 
* &quot;Ulex europaeus&quot; —common gorse
** subsp. &quot;europaeus&quot;
** subsp. &quot;latebracteatus&quot; 

* &quot;Ulex gallii&quot; —western gorse or western furze
* &quot;Ulex jussiaei&quot; 


* &quot;Ulex micranthus&quot;

** subsp. &quot;africanus&quot; 
** subsp. &quot;airensis&quot; 
** subsp. &quot;parviflorus&quot; 
** subsp. &quot;rivasgodayanus&quot; 



The number of species is likely higher, as many subspecies are not closely related to one another or have large differences in ploidy.
===Species names with uncertain taxonomic status===
The status of the following species is unresolved:

* &quot;Ulex eriophorus&quot; 
* &quot;Ulex spicatus&quot; 
===Hybrids===
The following hybrids have been described:
* &quot;Ulex&quot; ×&quot;breoganii&quot; (&quot;U. europaeus&quot; × &quot;U. gallii&quot;)
* &quot;Ulex&quot; ×&quot;dalilae&quot; (&quot;U. densus&quot; × &quot;U. jussiaei&quot;)
* &quot;Ulex&quot; ×&quot;lagrezii&quot; (&quot;U. europaeus&quot; × &quot;U. minor&quot;)

==Ecology==
Gorse may grow as a fire-climax plant, well adapted to encourage and withstand fires, being highly flammable and having seed pods that are, to a large extent, opened by fire: thus allowing rapid regeneration after fire. The burnt stumps will readily sprout new growth from the roots. Where fire is excluded, gorse soon tends to be shaded out by taller-growing trees, unless other factors, such as exposure, also apply. Typical fire recurrence periods in gorse-stands are 5–20 years.

Gorse thrives in poor growing areas and conditions, including drought; it is sometimes found on very rocky soils, where many species cannot thrive. Moreover, it is widely used for land reclamation (e.g. mine tailings), where its nitrogen-fixing capacity helps other plants establish better.

Gorse is a valuable plant for wildlife, providing dense, thorny cover that&#x27;s ideal for protecting bird nests. In Britain, France and Ireland, it is particularly noted for supporting Dartford warblers (&quot;Sylvia undata&quot;) and European stonechats (&quot;Saxicola rubicola&quot;); the common name of the whinchat (&quot;Saxicola rubetra&quot;) attests to its close association with gorse. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the caterpillars of the double-striped pug moth (&quot;Gymnoscelis rufifasciata&quot;), whilst those of the case-bearer moth &quot;Coleophora albicosta&quot; feed exclusively on gorse. The dry wood of dead gorse stems provides food for the caterpillars of the concealer moth &quot;Batia lambdella&quot;.

==Invasive species==
In many areas of North America (notably California and Oregon), southern South America, Australia, New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, and Hawaii, the common gorse—originally introduced as an ornamental plant or hedge—has become an invasive species owing to its aggressive seed dispersal; it has proved very difficult to eradicate and detrimental to native habitats. Common gorse is also an invasive species in the montane grasslands of Horton Plains National Park in Sri Lanka.

==Management==
Gorse readily becomes a dominant plant in suitable conditions. Where this is undesirable for agricultural or ecological reasons, control is required either to remove gorse completely, or to limit its extent. Gorse-stands are often managed by regular burning or flailing, allowing them to regrow from stumps or seed. Denser areas of gorse may be bulldozed.

==Uses==
===Foods===
Gorse flowers are edible and can be used in salads, teas and to make a non-grape-based fruit wine.

As fodder, gorse is high in protein and may be used as feed for livestock, particularly in winter, when other greenstuff is not available. Traditionally, it was used as fodder for horses and cattle, being made palatable either by bruising (crushing) with hand-held mallets, grinding it to a moss-like consistency with hand- or water-driven mills, or being finely chopped and mixed with straw chaff. Gorse is also eaten as forage by some livestock, such as feral ponies, which may eat little else in winter. Ponies may also eat the thinner stems of burnt gorse.

===Fuel===
Gorse-bushes are highly flammable; in many areas, bundles of gorse were used to fire traditional bread ovens.

On the island of Guernsey, Channel Islands, many traditional farms had furze brakes. The prolific gorse and bracken would be cut, dried and stored to be used as fuel, with farmhouses having purpose-built furze ovens.

===Wood===
Gorse wood has been used to make small objects; being non-toxic, it is especially suited for cutlery. In spite of its durability, it is not used for construction because the plant is too small and its wood is unstable, being prone to warping. Gorse is useful for garden ornaments, because it is resistant to weather and rot.
===Alternative medicine===
Gorse has been listed as one of the 38 plants that are used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine.

==Gorse-based symbols==

The furze is the badge of the Sinclair and MacLennan clans of Scotland. 
The flower, known as &quot;chorima&quot; in the Galician language, is the national flower of Galicia in northwest Spain.

The gorse is also the emblem of Brittany and is regaining popularity in Cornwall, particularly on St Piran&#x27;s Day.

==In popular culture==
The flammability of gorse rendered it a symbol for things that were quick to catch fire and burn out; for example, Doyle, in his book &quot;Sir Nigel&quot;, has Sir John Chandos say: &quot;They flare up like a furzebush in the flames, but if for a short space you may abide the heat of it, then there is a chance that it may be cooler ... If the Welsh be like the furze fire, then, pardieu! the Scotch are the peat, for they will smolder and you will never come to the end of them.&quot;

In many parts of Britain, especially Devon and Cornwall, where it is particularly prevalent on the moors, the expression &quot;kissing&#x27;s out of fashion when the gorse is out of blossom&quot; is a traditional jest, as common gorse is thought to be always in bloom. Sprigs of gorse—or rather, furze, as it was usually known in the West Country—were a traditional gift between young lovers on May Day, when the blossom is at its peak.

<doc id="448365" wikidata="Q645228" url="?curid=448365" title="Jaramogi Oginga Odinga">
<text>Jaramogi Ajuma Oginga Odinga (October 1911 – 20 January 1994) was a Kenyan politician who became a prominent figure in Kenya&#x27;s struggle for independence. He served as Kenya&#x27;s first vice-president, and thereafter as opposition leader. Odinga&#x27;s son Raila Odinga is a former prime minister, and another son, Oburu Odinga, is a former assistant minister in the Ministry of Finance.

Jaramogi is credited for the phrase &quot;Not Yet Uhuru&quot; which is the title of his autobiography published in 1967. &quot;Uhuru&quot; means freedom in Swahili and he was referencing his belief that even after independence from British colonialism, the brutal oppression of opposition in political affairs in Kenya, meant that the country had still not attained real freedom. For example, Jaramogi&#x27;s son Raila Odinga also spent eight years in detention, although he later served as prime minister.

==Early years and career==
Oginga Odinga was born in the village of Nyamira Kang&#x27;o, Bondo, to Mama Opondo Nyamagolo and Odinga Raila. In his autobiography, &quot;Not Yet Uhuru&quot;, Odinga estimates the date of his birth to be October 1911. Christened Obadiah Adonijah, he later renounced his Christian names and became known as Oginga Odinga. He was a student of Maseno School and Alliance High School. He went to Makerere University in 1940, and returned to Maseno High School as a teacher. In 1948 he joined the political party Kenya African Union (KAU).

Spurred to empower his Kenyan Luo ethnic group, Odinga started the Luo Thrift and Trading Corporation (registered in 1947). With time, Odinga and his group undertook to strengthen the union between Luo people in the whole of East Africa. His efforts earned him admiration and recognition among the Luo, who revered him as &quot;Ker&quot; – a title previously held by the fabled classical Luo king, Ramogi Ajwang, who reigned 400 years before him. Vowing to uphold the ideals of Ramogi Ajwang, Odinga became known as &quot;Jaramogi&quot; (man of the people of Ramogi).

==Vice presidency==
According to Luo tradition, a &quot;Ker&quot; cannot be a politician, so Odinga relinquished his position as king in 1957 and became the political spokesman of the Luo. The same year, he was elected member of the Legislative Council for the Central Nyanza constituency, and in 1958 he joined the Kenya African Union (KAU). He was amongst the founders of the Kenya Independence Movement in 1959, and in 1960, together with Tom Mboya he joined Kenya African National Union (KANU). When Kenya became a Republic in 1964, he was its first Vice-President.

As Vice-President he did not agree with Jomo Kenyatta&#x27;s government. While Odinga had called for closer ties with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union and other countries of the Warsaw Pact, Kenyatta was in favor of approaching the United States and the Western bloc. This led to Odinga resigning from his post and quitting KANU in 1966 to form the Kenya People&#x27;s Union (KPU).

==In opposition==
The friction between Odinga and Kenyatta continued, and in 1969 Odinga was arrested after the two verbally abused each other publicly at a chaotic function in Kisumu – and where at least 11 people were killed and dozens were injured in riots. That was when Jomo as the President of Kenya was to open New Nyanza General Hospital (Russia Hospital), in October 1969 which was seen as Odinga&#x27;s project due to his Russian connection. Due to the incident KPU was banned making Kenya a de facto party state under KANU. He was detained along with other KPU members for eighteen months until the Government made decision to free him on 27 March 1971. He consigned to political limbo until after Kenyatta&#x27;s death in August 1978. In the Uganda–Tanzania War (1978–1979), Odinga reportedly supported anti-Idi Amin rebels, sheltering a number of them at his farm in Bondo District during the preparation phase for the Battle of Tororo.

Kenyatta&#x27;s successor, Daniel arap Moi, appointed Odinga as chairman of the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board. He did not last long in the post, presumably due to past grudges he was still outspoken against Kenyatta&#x27;s policies. Odinga accused Jomo as a land grabber and that was why they had differed. Odinga attempted to register a political party in 1982, but The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Act, 1982 (which made Kenya a &quot;de jure&quot; single-party state), foiled his plans.

Following the failed coup of 1982 against Moi&#x27;s government, Odinga was placed again under house arrest in Kisumu. In 1990, he tried in vain with others to register an opposition party, the National Democratic Party. In 1991 he co-founded and became the interim chairman of Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD). The formation of FORD triggered a chain of events that were to change Kenya&#x27;s political landscape, culminating in 2002 ending KANU&#x27;s 40 years in power – eight years after Odinga&#x27;s death.

FORD split before the 1992 elections. Odinga himself vied for the presidency on Ford-Kenya ticket, but finished fourth with a share of 17.5% votes. However, he regained the Bondo Constituency seat after being forced out of parliamentary politics for over two decades. Odinga died in 1994 in Aga Khan Hospital, Kisumu. He is buried at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Mausoleum in his Bondo home.

==Private life==
Odinga was polygamous and had four wives: Mary Juma, Gaudencia Adeya, Susan Agik, and Betty Adongo. With these wives, he had seventeen children. Mary was the mother of Raila and Oburu. Mary died in 1984.

== Global policy ==
He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

<doc id="448370" wikidata="Q245179" url="?curid=448370" title="Analytical psychology">
<text>Analytical psychology (, sometimes translated as analytic psychology and referred to as Jungian analysis) is a term coined by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist, to describe research into his new &quot;empirical science&quot; of the psyche. It was designed to distinguish it from Freud&#x27;s psychoanalytic theories as their seven-year collaboration on psychoanalysis was drawing to an end between 1912 and 1913. The evolution of his science is contained in his monumental &quot;opus&quot;, the &quot;Collected Works&quot;, written over sixty years of his lifetime.

The history of analytical psychology is intimately linked with the biography of Jung. At the start, it was known as the &quot;Zurich school&quot;, whose chief figures were Eugen Bleuler, Franz Riklin, Alphonse Maeder and Jung, all centred in the Burghölzli hospital in Zurich. It was initially a theory concerning psychological complexes until Jung, upon breaking with Sigmund Freud, turned it into a generalised method of investigating archetypes and the unconscious, as well as into a specialised psychotherapy.

Analytical psychology, or &quot;complex psychology&quot;, from the , is the foundation of many developments in the study and practice of psychology as of other disciplines. Jung has many followers, and some of them are members of national societies around the world. They collaborate professionally on an international level through the International Association of Analytical Psychologists (IAAP) and the International Association for Jungian Studies (IAJS). Jung&#x27;s propositions have given rise to a multidisciplinary literature in numerous languages.

Among widely used concepts specific to analytical psychology are anima and animus, archetypes, the collective unconscious, complexes, extraversion and introversion, individuation, the Self, the shadow and synchronicity. The Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is loosely based on another of Jung&#x27;s theories on psychological types. A lesser known idea was Jung&#x27;s notion of &quot;the Psychoid&quot; to denote a hypothesised immanent plane beyond consciousness, distinct from the collective unconscious, and a potential &quot;locus&quot; of synchronicity.

The approximately &quot;three schools&quot; of post-Jungian analytical psychology that are current, the &quot;classical&quot;, &quot;archetypal&quot; and &quot;developmental&quot;, can be said to correspond to the developing yet overlapping aspects of Jung&#x27;s lifelong explorations, even if he expressly did not want to start a school of &quot;Jungians&quot;. Hence as Jung proceeded from a clinical practice which was mainly traditionally science-based and steeped in rationalist philosophy, anthropology and ethnography, his enquiring mind simultaneously took him into more esoteric spheres such as alchemy, astrology, gnosticism, metaphysics, myth and the paranormal, without ever abandoning his allegiance to science as his long-lasting collaboration with Wolfgang Pauli attests. His wide-ranging progression suggests to some commentators that, over time, his analytical psychotherapy, informed by his intuition and teleological investigations, became more of an &quot;art&quot;.

The findings of Jungian analysis and the application of analytical psychology to contemporary preoccupations such as social and family relationships, dreams and nightmares, work–life balance, architecture and urban planning, politics and economics, conflict and warfare, and climate change are illustrated in several publications and films.

==Origins==

Jung began his career as a psychiatrist in Zürich, Switzerland. Already employed at the Burghölzli hospital in 1901, in his academic dissertation for the medical faculty of the University of Zurich he took the risk of using his experiments on somnambulism and the visions of his mediumistic cousin, Helly Preiswerk. The work was entitled, &quot;On the Psychology and Pathology of So-Called Occult Phenomena&quot;. It was accepted but caused great upset among his mother&#x27;s family. Under the direction of psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, he also conducted research with his colleagues using a galvanometer to evaluate the emotional sensitivities of patients to lists of words during word association. Jung has left a description of his use of the device in treatment. His research earned him a worldwide reputation and numerous honours, including honorary Doctorates from Clark and Fordham Universities in 1909 and 1910 respectively. Other honours followed later.

In 1907, Jung travelled to meet Sigmund Freud in Vienna, Austria; they had begun corresponding a year earlier. At that stage, Jung, aged thirty-two, had a much greater international renown than the forty-nine-year-old neurologist. For a further six years, the two scholars worked and travelled to the United States together. In 1911, they founded the International Psychoanalytical Association, of which Jung was the first president. However, early in the collaboration, Jung had already observed that Freud would not tolerate ideas that were different from his own.

Unlike most modern psychologists, Jung did not believe in restricting himself to the scientific method as a means to understanding the human psyche. He saw dreams, myths, coincidence, and folklore as empirical evidence to further understanding and meaning. So although the unconscious cannot be studied by using direct methods, it acts as a useful working hypothesis, according to Jung. As he said, &quot;The beauty about the unconscious is that it is really unconscious.&quot; Hence, the unconscious is &#x27;untouchable&#x27; by experimental researches, or indeed any possible kind of scientific or philosophical reach, precisely because it is unconscious.

===The break with Freud===
It was the publication of a book by Jung which provoked the break with psychoanalysis and led to the founding of analytical psychology. In 1912 Jung met &quot;Miss Miller&quot;, brought to his notice by the work of Théodore Flournoy and whose case gave further substance to his theory of the &quot;collective unconscious&quot;. The study of her visions supplied the material which would go on to furnish his reasoning which he developed in &quot;Psychology of the Unconscious&quot; () (re-published as &quot;Symbols of Transformation&quot; in 1952) (C.W. Vol. 5). At this, Freud muttered about &quot;heresy&quot;. It was the second part of the work that brought the divergence to light. Freud mentioned to Ernest Jones that it was on page 174 of the original German edition, that Jung, according to him, had &quot;lost his way&quot;. It is the extract where Jung enlarged on his conception of the libido. The sanction was immediate: Jung was officially banned from the Vienna psychoanalytic circle from August 1912. From that date the psychoanalytic movement split into two obediences, with Freud&#x27;s partisans on one side, Karl Abraham being delegated to write a critical notice about Jung, and with Ernest Jones as defender of Freudian orthodoxy; while on the other side, were Jung&#x27;s partisans, including Leonhard Seif, Franz Riklin, Johan van Ophuijsen and Alphonse Maeder.

Jung&#x27;s innovative ideas with a new formulation of psychology and lack of contrition sealed the end of the Jung-Freud friendship in 1913. From then, the two scholars worked independently on personality development: Jung had already termed his approach &quot;analytical psychology&quot; (1912), while the approach Freud had founded is referred to as the Psychoanalytic School, (&quot;psychoanalytische Schule&quot;).
Jung&#x27;s postulated unconscious was quite different from the model proposed by Freud, despite the great influence that the founder of psychoanalysis had had on him. In particular, tensions manifested between him and Freud because of various disagreements, including those concerning the nature of the libido. Jung the importance of sexual development as an instinctual drive and focused on the collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas which Jung believed were inherited from generations of ancestors. While he accepted that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not consider that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality. Due to the particular hardships Jung had endured growing up, he believed his personal development and that of everyone was influenced by factors unrelated to sexuality.

The overarching aim in life, according to Jungian psychology, is the fullest possible actualisation of the &quot;Self&quot; through individuation. Jung defines the &quot;self&quot; as &quot;not only the centre but also the whole circumference which embraces both conscious and unconscious; it is the centre of this totality, just as the ego is the centre of the conscious mind&quot;. Central to this process of individuation is the individual&#x27;s continual encounter with the elements of the psyche by bringing them into consciousness. People experience the unconscious through symbols encountered in all aspects of life: in dreams, art, religion, and the symbolic dramas enacted in relationships and life pursuits. Essential to the process is the merging of the individual&#x27;s consciousness with the collective unconscious through a huge range of symbols. By bringing conscious awareness to bear on what is unconscious, such elements can be integrated with consciousness when they &quot;surface&quot;. To proceed with the individuation process, individuals need to be open to the parts of themselves beyond their own ego, which is the &quot;organ&quot; of consciousness. In a famous dictum, Jung said, &quot;the Self, like the unconscious is an &quot;a priori&quot; existent out of which the ego evolves. It is ... an unconscious prefiguration of the ego. It is not I who create myself, rather I happen to myself&#x27;.

It follows that the aim of (Jungian) psychotherapy is to assist the individual to establish a healthy relationship with the unconscious so that it is neither excessively out of balance in relation to it, as in neurosis, a state that can result in depression, anxiety, and personality disorders or so flooded by it that it risks psychosis resulting in mental breakdown. One method Jung applied to his patients between 1913 and 1916 was &quot;active imagination&quot;, a way of encouraging them to give themselves over to a form of meditation to release apparently random images from the mind to bridge unconscious contents into awareness.

&quot;Neurosis&quot; in Jung&#x27;s view results from the build up of psychological defences the individual unconsciously musters in an effort to cope with perceived attacks from the outside world, a process he called a &quot;complex&quot;, although complexes are not merely defensive in character. The psyche is a self-regulating adaptive system. People are energetic systems, and if the energy is blocked, the psyche becomes sick. If adaptation is thwarted, the psychic energy stops flowing and becomes rigid. This process manifests in neurosis and psychosis. Jung proposed that this occurs through maladaptation of one&#x27;s internal realities to external ones. The principles of adaptation, projection, and compensation are central processes in Jung&#x27;s view of psyche&#x27;s attempts to adapt.

==Innovations of Jungian analysis==
===Philosophical and epistemological foundations===
====Philosophy ====
Jung was an adept principally of the American philosopher William James, founder of pragmatism, whom he met during his trip to the United States in 1909. He also encountered other figures associated with James, such as John Dewey and the anthropologist, Franz Boas. Pragmatism was Jung&#x27;s favoured route to base his psychology on a sound scientific basis according to historian Sonu Shamdasani. His theories consist of observations of phenomena, and according to Jung it is phenomenology. In his view psychologism was suspect. Throughout his writings, Jung sees in empirical observation not only a precondition of an objective method but also respect for an ethical code which should guide the psychologist, as he stated in a letter to Joseph Goldbrunner: 

According to the Italo-French psychoanalyst Luigi Aurigemma, Jung&#x27;s reasoning is also marked by Immanuel Kant, and more generally by German rationalist philosophy. His lectures are evidence of his assimilation of Kantian thought, especially the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; and &quot;Critique of Practical Reason.&quot; Aurigemma characterises Jung&#x27;s thinking as &quot;epistemological relativism&quot; because it does not postulate any belief in the metaphysical. In fact, Jung uses Kant&#x27;s teleology to bridle his thinking and to guard himself from straying into any metaphysical excursions. On the other hand, for French historian of psychology, Françoise Parot, contrary to the alleged rationalist vein, Jung is &quot;heir&quot; to mystics, (Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen, or Augustine of Hippo,) and to the romantics be they scientists, such as Carl Gustav Carus or Gotthilf Heinrich von Schubert in particular, or to philosophers and writers, along the lines of Nietzsche, Goethe, and Schopenhauer, in the way he conceptualised the unconscious in particular. Whereas his typology is profoundly dependent on Carl Spitteler.

====Scientific heritage====

As a trained psychiatrist, Jung had a grounding in the state of science in his day. He regularly refers to the experimental psychology of Wilhelm Wundt. His Word Association Test designed with Franz Riklin is actually the direct application of Wundt&#x27;s theory. Notwithstanding the great debt of analytical psychology to Sigmund Freud, Jung borrowed concepts from other theories of his time. For instance, the expression &quot;abaissement du niveau mental&quot; comes directly from the French psychologist Pierre Janet whose courses Jung attended during his studies in France, during 1901. Jung had always acknowledged how much Janet had influenced his career. 
Jung&#x27;s use of the concept of &quot;participation mystique&quot; is owed to the French ethnologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl:
Jung used the concept to illustrate the case of men of a South American tribe fantasizing they are macaw birds.

Finally, his use of the English expression, &quot;pattern of behaviour&quot;, which is synonymous with the term archetype, is drawn from British studies in ethology.

The principal contribution to analytical psychology, nevertheless, remains that of Freud&#x27;s psychoanalysis, from which Jung took a number of concepts, especially the method of inquiring into the unconscious through free association. Individual analysts&#x27; thinking was also integrated into his project, among whom are Sándor Ferenczi (Jung refers to his notion of &quot;affect&quot;) or Ludwig Binswanger and his &quot;&quot;, (Daseinsanalysis). Jung affirms also Freud&#x27;s contribution to our knowledge of the psyche as being, without doubt, of the highest importance. It reveals penetrating information about the dark corners of the soul and of the human personality, which is of the same order as Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;On the Genealogy of Morality&quot; (1887). In this context, Freud was, according to Jung, one of the great cultural critics of the 19th century.

====Divergences from psychoanalysis====
Jungian analysis is, like psychoanalysis, a method to access, experience and integrate unconscious material into awareness. It is a search for the meaning of behaviours, feelings and events. Many are the channels to extend knowledge of the self: the analysis of dreams is one important avenue. Others may include expressing feelings about and through art, poetry or other expressions of creativity, the examination of conflicts and repeating patterns in a person&#x27;s life. A comprehensive description of the process of dream interpretation is complex, in that it is highly specific to the person who undertakes it. Most succinctly it relies on the associations which the particular dream symbols suggest to the dreamer, which at times may be deemed &quot;archetypal&quot; in so far as they are supposed common to many people throughout history. Examples could be a hero, an old man or woman, situations of pursuit, flying or falling.

Whereas Freudian psychoanalysis relies entirely on the development of the transference in the &quot;analysand&quot; (the person under treatment) to the analyst, Jung initially used the transference and later concentrated more on a dialectical and didactic approach to the symbolic and archetypal material presented by the patient. Moreover, his attitude towards patients departed from what he had observed in Freud&#x27;s method. Anthony Stevens has explained it thus:

:Though [Jung&#x27;s] initial formulations arose mainly out of his own creative illness, they were also a conscious reaction against the stereotype of the classical Freudian analyst, sitting silent and aloof behind the couch, occasionally emitting &quot;ex cathedra&quot; pronouncements and interpretations, while remaining totally uninvolved in the patient&#x27;s guilt, anguish, and need for reassurance and support. Instead, Jung offered the radical proposal that analysis is a &quot;dialectical&quot; procedure, a two-way exchange between two people, who are equally involved. Although it was a revolutionary idea when he first suggested it, it is a model which has influenced psychotherapists of most schools, though many seem not to realise that it originated with Jung.

In place of Freud&#x27;s &quot;surgical detachment&quot;, Jung demonstrated a more relaxed and warmer welcome in the consulting room. He remained aware nonetheless that exposure to a patient&#x27;s unconscious contents always posed a certain risk of contagion (he calls it &quot;psychic infection&quot;) to the analyst, as experienced in the countertransference. The process of contemporary Jungian analysis depends on the type of &quot;school of analytical psychology&quot; to which the therapist adheres, (see below). The &quot;Zurich School&quot; would reflect the approach Jung himself taught, while those influenced by Michael Fordham and associates in London, would be significantly closer to a Kleinian approach and therefore, concerned with analysis of the transference and countertransference as indicators of repressed material along with the attendant symbols and patterns.

===Dream work===
Jung&#x27;s preoccupation with dreams can be dated from 1902. It was only after the break with Freud that he published in 1916 his &quot;Psychology of the Unconscious&quot; where he elaborated his view of dreams, which contrasts sharply with Freud&#x27;s conceptualisation. While he agrees that dreams are a highway into the unconscious, he enlarges on their functions further than psychoanalysis did. One of the salient differences is the compensatory function they perform by reinstating psychic equilibrium in respect of judgments made during waking life: thus a man consumed by ambition and arrogance may, for example, dream about himself as small and vulnerable person.
According to Jung, this demonstrates that the man&#x27;s attitude is excessively self-assured and thereby refuses to integrate the inferior aspects of his personality, which are denied by his defensive arrogance. Jung calls this a &quot;compensation mechanism&quot;, necessary for the maintenance of a healthy mental balance. Shortly before his death in 1961, he wrote: Unconscious material is expressed in images through the deployment of symbolism which, in Jungian terms, means it has an affective role (in that it can sometimes give rise to a numinous feeling, when associated with an archetypal force) and an intellectual role. Some dreams are personal to the dreamer, others may be collective in origin or &quot;transpersonal&quot; in so far as they relate to existential events. They can be taken to express phases of the &quot;individuation&quot; process (see below) and may be inspired by literature, art, alchemy or mythology.

Analytical psychology is recognized for its historical and geographical study of myths as a means to deconstruct, with the aid of symbols, the unconscious manifestations of the psyche. Myths are said to represent directly the elements and phenomena arising from the collective unconscious and though they may be subject to alteration in their detail through time, their significance remains similar. While Jung relies predominantly on Christian or on Western pagan mythology (Ancient Greece and Rome), he holds that the unconscious is driven by mythologies derived from all cultures. He evinced an interest in Hinduism, in Zoroastrianism and Taoism, which all share fundamental images reflected in the psyche. Thus analytical psychology focusses on meaning, based on the hypothesis that human beings are potentially in constant touch with universal and symbolic aspects common to humankind. In the words of André Nataf: 

===Principal concepts ===
In analytical psychology two distinct types of psychological process may be identified: that deriving from the individual, characterised as &quot;personal&quot;, belonging to a subjective psyche, and that deriving from the collective, linked to the structure of an objective psyche, which may be termed &quot;transpersonal&quot;. These processes are both said to be archetypal. Some of these processes are regarded as specifically linked to consciousness, such as the animus or anima, the persona or the shadow. Others pertain more to the collective sphere. Jung tended to personify the anima and animus as they are, according to him, always attached to a person and represent an aspect of his or her psyche.

====Anima and animus====

Jung identified the archetypal anima as being the unconscious feminine component of men and the archetypal animus as the unconscious masculine component in women. These are shaped by the contents of the collective unconscious, by others, and by the larger society. However, many modern-day Jungian practitioners do not ascribe to a literal definition, citing that the Jungian concept points to every person having both an anima and an animus. Jung considered, for instance, an &quot;animus of the anima&quot; in men, in his work &quot;Aion&quot; and in an interview in which he says:Jung stated that the anima and animus act as guides to the unconscious unified Self, and that forming an awareness and a connection with the anima or animus is one of the most difficult and rewarding steps in psychological growth. Jung reported that he identified his anima as she spoke to him, as an inner voice, unexpectedly one day.

In cases where the anima or animus complexes are ignored, they vie for attention by projecting itself on others. This explains, according to Jung, why we are sometimes immediately attracted to certain strangers: we see our anima or animus in them. Love at first sight is an example of anima and animus projection. Moreover, people who strongly identify with their gender role (e.g. a man who acts aggressively and never cries) have not actively recognized or engaged their anima or animus.

Jung attributes human rational thought to be the male nature, while the irrational aspect is considered to be natural female (rational being defined as involving judgment, irrational being defined as involving perceptions). Consequently, irrational moods are the progenies of the male anima shadow and irrational opinions of the female animus shadow.

====Archetypes====

The use of archetypes in psychology was advanced by Jung in an essay entitled &quot;Instinct and the Unconscious&quot; in 1919. The first element in Greek &#x27;arche&#x27; signifies &#x27;beginning, origin, cause, primal source principle&#x27;, by extension it can signify &#x27;position of a leader, supreme rule and government&#x27;. The second element &#x27;type&#x27; means &#x27;blow or what is produced by a blow, the imprint of a coin ...form, image, prototype, model, order, and norm&#x27;, ...in the figurative, modern sense, &#x27;pattern underlying form, primordial form&#x27;. In his psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal or personal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. The method he favoured was hermeneutics which was central in his practice of psychology from the start. He made explicit references to hermeneutics in the Collected Works and during his theoretical development of the notion of archetypes. Although he lacks consistency in his formulations, his theoretical development of archetypes is rich in hermeneutic implications. As noted by Smythe and Baydala (2012), A group of memories and attitudes associated with an archetype can become a complex, e.g. a mother complex may be associated with a particular mother archetype. Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological givens which probably arose through evolution.

Archetypes have been regarded as collective as well as individual, and identifiable in a variety of creative ways. As an example, in his book &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot;, Jung states that he began to see and talk to a manifestation of anima and that she taught him how to interpret dreams. As soon as he could interpret on his own, Jung said that she ceased talking to him because she was no longer needed. However, the essentialism inherent in archetypal theory in general and concerning the anima, in particular, has called for a re-evaluation of Jung&#x27;s theory in terms of emergence theory. This would emphasise the role of symbols in the construction of affect in the midst of collective human action. In such a reconfiguration, the visceral energy of a numinous experience can be retained while the problematic theory of archetypes has outlived its usefulness.

====Collective unconscious====

Jung&#x27;s concept of the collective unconscious has undergone re-interpretation over time. The term &quot;collective unconscious&quot; first appeared in Jung&#x27;s 1916 essay, &quot;The Structure of the Unconscious&quot;. This essay distinguishes between the &quot;personal&quot;, Freudian unconscious, filled with fantasies (e. g. sexual) and repressed images, and the &quot;collective&quot; unconscious encompassing the soul of humanity at large.

In &quot;The Significance of Constitution and Heredity in Psychology&quot; (November 1929), Jung wrote:

Given that in his day he lacked the advances of complexity theory and especially complex adaptive systems (CAS), it has been argued that his vision of archetypes as a stratum in the collective unconscious, corresponds to nodal patterns in the collective unconscious which go on to shape the characteristic patterns of human imagination and experience and in that sense, &quot;seems a remarkable, intuitive articulation of the CAS model&quot;.

====Individuation====
Individuation is a complex process that involves going through different stages of growing awareness through the progressive confrontation and integration of personal unconscious elements. This is the central concept of analytical psychology first introduced in 1916. It is the objective of Jungian psychotherapy to the extent that it enables the realisation of the Self. As Jung stated: Jung started experimenting with individuation after his split with Freud as he confronted what was described as eruptions from the collective unconscious driven by a contemporary malaise of spiritual alienation. According to Jung, individuation means becoming an individual and implies becoming one&#x27;s own self. Unlike individuality, which emphasizes some supposed peculiarity, Jung described individuation as a better and more complete fulfillment of the collective qualities of the human being. In his experience, Jung explained that individuation helped him, &quot;from the therapeutic point of view, to find the particular images that lie behind emotions&quot;.

Individuation is from the first what the analysand must undergo, to integrate the other elements of the psyche. This pursuit of wholeness aims to establish the Self, which include both the rational conscious mind of the ego and the irrational contents of the unconscious, as the new personality center. Prior to individuation, the analysand is carefully assessed to determine if the ego is strong enough to take the intensity of this process. The elements to be integrated include the persona which acts as the representative of the person in her/his role in society, the shadow which contains all that is personally unknown and what the person considers morally reprehensible and, the anima or the animus, which respectively carry their feminine and masculine values. For Jung many unconscious conflicts at the root of neurosis are caused by the difficulty to accept that such a dynamic can unbalance the subject from his habitual position and confronts her/him with aspects of the self they were accustomed to ignore. Once individuation is completed the ego is no longer at the centre of the personality. The process, however, does not lead to a complete self-realization and that individuation can never be a fixed state due to the unfathomable nature of the depths of the collective unconscious.

====Shadow====

The shadow is an unconscious complex defined as the repressed, suppressed or disowned qualities of the conscious self. According to Jung, the human being deals with the reality of the shadow in four ways: denial, projection, integration and/or transmutation. Jung himself asserted that &quot;the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man&#x27;s shadow-side unexampled in any previous age.&quot; According to analytical psychology, a person&#x27;s shadow may have both constructive and destructive aspects. In its more destructive aspects, the shadow can represent those things people do not accept about themselves. For instance, the shadow of someone who identifies as being kind may be harsh or unkind. Conversely, the shadow of a person who perceives himself to be brutal may be gentle. In its more constructive aspects, a person&#x27;s shadow may represent hidden positive qualities. This has been referred to as the &quot;gold in the shadow&quot;. Jung emphasized the importance of being aware of shadow material and incorporating it into conscious awareness to avoid projecting shadow qualities on others.

The shadow in dreams is often represented by dark figures of the same gender as the dreamer.

The shadow may also concern great figures in the history of human thought or even spiritual masters, who became great because of their shadows or because of their ability to live their shadows (namely, their unconscious faults) in full without repressing them.

====Persona====

Just like the &quot;anima&quot; and &quot;animus&quot;, the &quot;persona&quot; (derived from the Latin term for a mask, as would have been worn by actors) is another key concept in analytical psychology. It is the part of the personality which manages an individual&#x27;s relations with society in the outside world and works the same way for both sexes. The persona, which is at the heart of the psyche, is contrary to the shadow which is actually the true personality but denied by the self. The conscious self identifies primarily with the persona during development in childhood as the individual develops a psychological framework for dealing with others. Identifications with diplomas, social roles, with honours and awards, with a career, all contribute to the apparent constitution of the persona and which do not lead to knowledge of the self. For Jung, the persona has nothing real about it. It can only be a compromise between the individual and society, yielding an illusion of individuality. Individuation consists, in the first instance, of discarding the individual&#x27;s mask, but not too quickly as often, it is all the patient has as a means of identification. The persona is implicated in a number of symptoms such as compulsive disorders, phobias, shifting moods, and addictions, among others.

====Psychological types====
Analytical psychology distinguishes several psychological types or temperaments.
* Extravert
* Introvert

According to Jung, the psyche is an apparatus for adaptation and orientation, and consists of a number of different psychic functions. Among these he distinguishes four basic functions:
* Sensation – Perception by means of the sense organs
* Intuition – Perceiving in unconscious way or perception of unconscious contents
* Thinking – Function of intellectual cognition; the forming of logical conclusions
* Feeling – Function of subjective estimation

====Complexes====
Early in Jung&#x27;s career he coined the term and described the concept of the &quot;complex&quot;. Jung claims to have discovered the concept during his free association and galvanic skin response experiments. Freud obviously took up this concept in his Oedipus complex amongst others. Jung seemed to see complexes as quite autonomous parts of psychological life. It is almost as if Jung were describing separate personalities within what is considered a single individual, but to equate Jung&#x27;s use of complexes with something along the lines of multiple personality disorder would be a step out of bounds.

Jung saw an archetype as always being the central organizing structure of a complex. For instance, in a &quot;negative mother complex&quot;, the archetype of the &quot;negative mother&quot; would be seen to be central to the identity of that complex. This is to say, our psychological lives are patterned on common human experiences. Jung saw the Ego (which Freud wrote about in German literally as the &quot;I&quot;, one&#x27;s conscious experience of oneself) as a complex. If the &quot;I&quot; is a complex, what might be the archetype that structures it? Jung, and many Jungians, might say &quot;the hero&quot;, one who separates from the community to ultimately carry the community further.

====Synchronicity====

Jung first officially used the term &quot;synchronicity&quot; during a conference held in memory of his sinologist friend, Richard Wilhelm in 1930. It was part of his explanation of the modus operandi of the &quot;I Ching&quot;. The second reference was made in 1935 in his Tavistock Lectures.

For an overview of the origins of the concept, see Joseph Cambray: &quot;Synchronicity as emergence&quot;. It was used to denote the simultaneous occurrence of two events with no causal physical connection, but whose association evokes a meaning for the person experiencing or observing it. The often cited example of the phenomenon is Jung&#x27;s own account of a beetle (the common rose-chafer, &quot;Cetonia aurata&quot;) flying into his consulting room directly following on from his patient telling him a dream featuring a golden scarab. The concept only makes sense psychologically and cannot be reduced to a verified or scientific fact. For Jung it constitutes a working hypothesis which has subsequently given rise to many ambiguities.

According to Jung, an archetype which has been constellated in the psyche can, under certain circumstances, transgress the boundary between substance and psyche. 

Jung had studied such phenomena with the physicist and Nobel Prize winner, Wolfgang Pauli, who did not always agree with Jung, and with whom he carried on an extensive correspondence, enriched by the contributions of both specialists in their own fields. Pauli had given a series of lectures to the C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich whose member and patron he had been since 1947. It gave rise to a joint essay: &quot;Synchronicity, an a-causal principle&quot; (1952) The two men saw in the idea of synchronicity a potential way of explaining a particular relationship between &quot;incontrovertible facts&quot;, whose occurrence is tied to unconscious and archetypal manifestations, Borrowing the notion from Arthur Schopenhauer, Jung calls it &quot;Unus mundus&quot;, a state where neither matter nor the psyche are distinguishable. whereas for Pauli it was a limiting concept, in two senses, in that it is at once scientific and symbolic. According to him, the phenomenon is dependent on the observer. Nevertheless, both men were in accord that there existed the possibility of a conjunction between physics and psychology. Jung wrote in a letter to Pauli:

Marie-Louise von Franz also had a lengthy exchange of letters with Wolfgang Pauli. On Pauli&#x27;s death in 1958, his widow, Franca, deliberately destroyed all the letters von Franz had sent to her husband, and which he had kept locked inside his writing desk. However, the letters from Pauli to von Franz were all saved and were later made available to researchers and published.

Synchronicity is among the most developed ideas by Jung&#x27;s followers, notably by , James Hillman, Roderick Main, Carl Alfred Meier and by the British developmental clinician, George Bright. It has been explored also in a range of spiritual currents who have sought in it a scientific rigour.

Although Synchronicity as conceived by Jung within the bounds of the science available in his day, has been categorised as pseudoscience, recent developments in complex adaptive systems argue for a revision of such a view. Critics cite that Jung&#x27;s experiments that sought to provide statistical proof for this theory did not yield satisfactory result. His experiment was also faulted for not using a true random sampling method as well as for the use of dubious statistics and astrological material.

==Post-Jungian approaches==
Andrew Samuels (1985) has distinguished three distinct traditions or approaches of &quot;post-Jungian&quot; psychology – classical, developmental and archetypal. Today there are more developments.

===Classical===
The classical approach tries to remain faithful to Jung&#x27;s proposed model, his teachings and the substance of his 20 volume Collected Works, together with recently published works, such as the &quot;Liber Novus&quot;, and the Black Books. Prominent advocates of this approach, according to Samuels (1985), include Emma Jung, Jung&#x27;s wife, an analyst in her own right, Marie-Louise von Franz, Joseph L. Henderson, Aniela Jaffé, Erich Neumann, Gerhard Adler and Jolande Jacobi. Jung credited Neumann, author of &quot;Origins of Conscious&quot; and &quot;Origins of the Child&quot;, as his principal student to advance his (Jung&#x27;s) theory into a mythology-based approach. He is associated with developing the symbolism and archetypal significance of several myths: the Child, Creation, the Hero, the &quot;Great Mother&quot; and Transcendence.

===Archetypal===

One archetypal approach, sometimes called &quot;the imaginal school&quot; by James Hillman, was written about by him in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its adherents, according to Samuels (1985), include Gerhard Adler, Irene Claremont de Castillejo, Adolf Guggenbühl-Craig, Murray Stein, and Wolfgang Giegerich. Thomas Moore also was influenced by some of Hillman&#x27;s work. Developed independently, other psychoanalysts have created strong approaches to archetypal psychology. Mythopoeticists and psychoanalysts such as Clarissa Pinkola Estés who believes that ethnic and aboriginal people are the originators of archetypal psychology and have long carried the maps for the journey of the soul in their songs, tales, dream-telling, art and rituals; Marion Woodman who proposes a feminist viewpoint regarding archetypal psychology. Some of the mythopoetic/archetypal psychology creators either imagine the Self not to be the main archetype of the collective unconscious as Jung thought, but rather assign each archetype equal value. Others, who are modern progenitors of archetypal psychology (such as Estés), think of the Self as the thing that contains and yet is suffused by all other archetypes, each giving life to the other.

Robert L. Moore has explored the archetypal level of the human psyche in a series of five books co-authored with Douglas Gillette, which have played an important role in the men&#x27;s movement in the United States. Moore studies computerese so he uses a computer&#x27;s hard wiring (its fixed physical components) as a metaphor for the archetypal level of the human psyche. Personal experiences influence the access to the archetypal level of the human psyche, but personalized ego consciousness can be likened to computer software.

In the 21st century, Jordan Peterson is a prominent Jungian psychologist whose extensive work &quot;Maps of Meaning&quot; is centered around the theories of Jungian archetypes.

===Developmental===
A major expansion of Jungian theory is credited to Michael Fordham and his wife, Frieda Fordham. It can be considered a bridge between traditional Jungian analysis and Melanie Klein&#x27;s object relations theory. Judith Hubback and William Goodheart MD are also included in this group. Andrew Samuels (1985) considers J.W.T. Redfearn, Richard Carvalho and himself as representatives of the developmental approach. Samuels notes how this approach differs from the classical by giving less emphasis to the Self and more emphasis to the development of personality; he also notes how, in terms of practice in therapy, it gives more attention to transference and counter-transference than either the classical or the archetypal approaches.

===Sandplay therapy===
Sandplay is a non-directive, creative form of therapy using the imagination, originally used with children and adolescents, later also with adults. Jung had stressed the importance of finding the image behind the emotion. The use of sand in a suitable tray with figurines and other small toys, farm animals, trees, fences and cars enables a narrative to develop through a series of scenarios. This is said to express an ongoing dialogue between the conscious and the unconscious aspects of the psyche, which in turn activates a healing process whereby the patient and therapist can together view the evolving sense of self.

Jungian Sandplay started as a therapeutic method in the 1950s. Although its origin has been credited to a Swiss Jungian analyst, Dora Kalff it was in fact, her mentor and trainer, Dr. Margaret Lowenfeld, a British paediatrician, who had developed the &quot;Lowenfeld World Technique&quot; inspired by the writer H. G. Wells in her work with children, using a sand tray and figurines in the 1930s. Jung had witnessed a demonstration of the technique while on a visit to the UK in 1937. Kalff saw in it potential as a further application of analytical psychology. Encouraged by Jung, Kalff developed the new application over a number of years and called it &quot;Sandplay&quot;. From 1962 she began to train Jungian Analysts in the method including in the United States, Europe and Japan. Both Kalff and Jung believed an image can offer greater therapeutic engagement and insight than words alone. Through the sensory experience of working with sand and objects, and their symbolic resonance new areas of awareness can be brought into consciousness, as in dreams, which through their frames and storyline can bring material into consciousness as part of an integrating and healing process. The historian of psychology, Sonu Shamdasani has commented:

One of Dora Kalff&#x27;s trainees was the American concert pianist, Joel Ryce-Menuhin, whose music career was ended by illness and who retrained as a Jungian analyst and exponent of sandplay.

===Process-oriented psychology===

Process-oriented psychology (also called Process work) is associated with the Zurich-trained Jungian analyst Arnold Mindell. Process work developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was originally identified as a &quot;daughter of Jungian psychology&quot;. Process work stresses awareness of the &quot;unconscious&quot; as an ongoing flow of experience. This approach expands Jung&#x27;s work beyond verbal individual therapy to include body experience, altered and comatose states as well as multicultural group work.

==The Analytic attitude==
Formally Jungian analysis differs little from psychoanalysis. However, variants of each school have developed overlaps and specific divergences through the century, or more, of their existence. They share a &quot;frame&quot; consisting of regular spatio-temporal meetings, one or more times a week, focusing on patient material, using dialogue which may consist of elaboration, amplification and abreaction and which may last on average three years (sometimes more briefly or far longer). The spatial arrangement between analyst and analysand may differ: seated face to face or the patient may use the couch with the analyst seated behind.

In some approaches alternative elements of expression can take place, such as active imagination, sandplay, drawing or painting, even music. The session may at times become semi-directed (in contrast to psychoanalytic treatment which is essentially a non-directive encounter). The patient is at the heart of the therapy, as Marie Louise von Franz has it in her work, &quot;Psychotherapy: the practitioner&#x27;s experience&quot;, where she recounts Jung&#x27;s thinking on that point. The transference is sought out (contrary to psychoanalytic treatment which distinguishes positive and negative transferences) and, the interpretation of dreams is one of the central pillars of Jungian psychotherapy. In all other respects, the rules correspond to those of classical psychoanalysis: the analyst examines free associations and tries to be objective and ethical, meaning respectful of the patient&#x27;s pace and rhythm of unfolding progress. In fact, the task of Jungian analysis is not merely to explore the patient&#x27;s past, but to connect conscious awareness with the unconscious such that a better adaptation to their emotional and social life may ensue.

Neurosis is not a symptom of the re-emergence of a repressed past, but is regarded as the functional, sometimes somatic, incapacity to face certain aspects of lived reality. In Jungian analysis the unconscious is the motivator whose task it is to bring into awareness the patient&#x27;s shadow, in alliance with the analyst, the more so since unconscious processes enacted in the transference provoke a dependent relationship by the analysand on the analyst, leading to a falling away of the usual defences and references. This requires that the analyst guarantee the safety of the transference. The responsibilities and accountability of individual analysts and their membership organisations, matters of clinical confidentiality and codes of ethics and professional relations with the public sphere are explored in a volume edited by Solomon and Twyman, with contributions from Jungian analysts and psychoanalysts. Solomon has characterised the nature of the patient – analyst relationship as one where the analytic attitude is an ethical attitude since: 

==Jungian social, literary and art criticism==
Analytical psychology has inspired a number of contemporary academic researchers to revisit some of Jung&#x27;s own preoccupations with the role of women in society, with philosophy and with literary and art criticism. Leading figures to explore these fields include the British-American, Susan Rowland, who produced the first feminist revision of Jung and the fundamental contributions made to his work by the creative women who surrounded him. She has continued to mine his work by evaluating his influence on modern literary criticism and as a writer. Leslie Gardner has devoted a series of volumes to analytical psychology in 21st century life, one of which concentrates on the &quot;Feminine Self&quot;. Paul Bishop, a British German scholar, has placed analytical psychology in the context of precursors such as, Goethe, Schiller and Nietzsche.

The Franco-Swiss art historian and analytical psychologist, Christian Gaillard, has examined Jung&#x27;s place as an artist and art critic in his series of Fay lectures at the Texas A&amp;M University. These scholars draw from Jung&#x27;s works that apply analytical psychology to literature such as the lecture &quot;On the Relation of Analytical Psychology to Poetry&quot;. In this presentation, which was delivered in 1922, Jung stated that the psychologist cannot replace the art critic. He rejected the Freudian art criticism for reducing complex works of art to Oedipal fantasies of their creators, stressing the danger of simplifying literature to causes found outside of the actual work.

==Criticism==

Since its inception, analytical psychology has been the object of criticism, emanating from the psychoanalytic sphere. Freud himself characterised Jung as a &quot;mystic and a snob&quot;. In his introduction to the 2011 edition of Jung&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on the Theory of Psychoanalysis&quot;, given in New York City in 1912, Sonu Shamdasani contends that Freud orchestrated a round of critical reviews of Jung&#x27;s writings from Karl Abraham, Jung&#x27;s former colleague at the Burghölzli hospital, and from the early Welsh Freudian, Ernest Jones. Such criticisms multiplied during the 20th century, focusing primarily on the &quot;mysticism&quot; in Jung&#x27;s writings. Other psychoanalysts, including Jungian analysts, objected to the cult of personality around the Swiss psychiatrist. It reached a crescendo with Jung&#x27;s perceived collusion with Nazism in the build-up and during World War II and is still a recurrent theme. Thomas Kirsch writes: &quot;Successive generations of Jungian analysts and analysands have wrestled with the question of Jung&#x27;s complex relations to Germany.&quot; Other considered evaluations come from Andrew Samuels and from Robert Withers.
The French philosopher, , considers that the concept of the collective unconscious, &quot;shows also how easily one can slip from the psychological unconscious into perspectives from a universe of thought, quite alien from traditional philosophy and science, where this idea arose.&quot; (&quot;Le concept jungien d&#x27;inconscient collectif &quot;témoigne également de la facilité avec laquelle on peut glisser du concept d&#x27;inconscient psychologique vers des perspectives relevant d&#x27;un univers de pensée étranger à la tradition philosophique et scientifique dans laquelle ce concept est né&#x27;&quot;).

In his &quot;Le Livre Rouge de la psychanalyse&quot; (&quot;Red Book of psychoanalysis&quot;), the French psychoanalyst, , criticizes Jung&#x27;s tendency to be fascinated by the image and to reduce the human to an archetype. He contends that Jung dwells in a world of ideas and abstractions, in a world of books and old secrets lost in ancient books of spells (fr: grimoires). While claiming to be an empiricist, Amselek finds Jung to be an idealist, a pure thinker who has unquestionably demonstrated his intellectual talent for speculation and the invention of ideas. While he considers his epistemology to be in advance of that of Freud, Jung remains stuck in his intellectualism and in his narrow provincial outlook. In fact, his hypotheses are determined by the concept of his postulated pre-existing world and he has constantly sought to find confirmations of it in the old traditions of Western Medieval Europe.

Perhaps the most prominent critic of Analytical Psychology has been American clinical psychologist and historian of medicine Richard Noll, who claims that Analytical Psychology &quot;was constructed deliberately, and somewhat deceptively, by Jung to make his own magical, polytheist, pagan worldview more palatable to a secularized world conditioned to respect only those ideas that seem to have a scientific air to them. I make this judgment about Jung without being either Christian or Jew or Moslem--or Freudian&quot;.

He argues in his books &quot;The Jung Cult: Origins of a Charismatic Movement&quot; and &quot;The Aryan Christ: The Secret Life of Carl Jung&quot; that Jung secretly founded a mystery cult based on pre-Christian Germanic pagan ideals, influenced by the late 19th and early 20th century Völkisch movement.

Noll&#x27;s work was received critically by the Jungian community. Sonu Shamdasani, who originally corresponded with Noll prior to his publication of &quot;The Jung Cult&quot;, wrote a rebuttal titled &quot;Cult Fictions&quot;, in which he claims &quot;some of Jung’s followers were responsible for attempting to turn analytical psychology into a quasi-religious cult, but not Jung himself. This distinction is critical.&quot;

French psychoanalyst Élisabeth Roudinesco, another critic of Noll, stated in a review: &quot;Even if Noll&#x27;s theses are based on a solid familiarity with the Jungian &quot;corpus&quot; [...], they deserve to be re-examined, such is the detestation of the author for the object of his study that it diminishes the credibility of the arguments.&quot; (&quot;Même si les thèses de Noll sont étayées par une solide connaissance du corpus jungien [...], elles méritent être réexaminées, tant la détestation de l&#x27;auteur vis-à-vis de son objet d&#x27;étude diminue la crédibilité de l&#x27;argumentation.&quot;)

Another, a French ethnographer and anthropologist, , criticized Jung over his alleged misuse of the term &quot;archetype&quot; and his &quot;suspect motives&quot; in dealings with some of his colleagues.

<text>Ida Nyrop Ludvigsen (1927–1973), Danish translator and official, was born and raised in Gentofte, Denmark as the first of two children. Her parents, mag.art Karen Nyrop and mag.art Anders Carl Christensen, were both engaged to teach French language for listeners at the Danish State Broadcast when it started around 1926.

Ludvigsen lost her father at the age of fourteen, but her mother Karen managed the very popular radio lessons until 1953 and provided for her family by numerous translations of classic and modern French literature.

Ludvigsen married in 1946 to Holger Ludvigsen (1925–2008) and never finished her university studies in literature, but became a mother of five children. Among them is the author and journalist Jacob Ludvigsen (1947) who among other happenings founded the free town of Christiania in Copenhagen. After thirteen years of marriage and mothering, she started working at the Danish Royal Library in Copenhagen. She published occasional short stories, articles or reviews, and a single collection of poems called Modsat (Opposite) in 1966. At that time, she started her career as a translator from English.

Her most successful work was translating J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s books. Her translation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1968-1972) was the first to profit from Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings&quot; for translators. The translation has been criticised by linguists as well as by Tolkien fans; it adapted Tolkien&#x27;s style to suit a Danish audience. However, at the time there were few works of Tolkien scholarship for Ludvigsen to refer to when making her translation.

She had numerous other public roles, the most important as a member of the Danish State Radio council.

<text>Dame Susan Elizabeth Anne Devoy (born 4 January 1964) is a New Zealand former squash player and senior public servant. As a squash player, she was dominant in the late 1980s and early 1990s, winning the World Open on four occasions. She served as New Zealand&#x27;s Race Relations Commissioner from 2013 to 2018.

== Early life and family ==
Devoy was born in Rotorua, the youngest of seven children and her parents&#x27; only daughter. Her family, including her six brothers, also played squash and Devoy started playing when she was very young. She began playing in tournaments when she was nine and turned professional at the age of 17 after leaving MacKillop College halfway through her final year. She competed on the professional circuit for eleven years from 1981 to 1992.

She married her manager and fellow squash player John Oakley, on 12 December 1986 in Rotorua&#x27;s St Michael&#x27;s Church. Together, they have four sons, the eldest of whom is track athlete Julian Oakley. Julian is an NCAA Division I athlete at Providence College, in Rhode Island, United States, and has a 3:57.22 personal best for the mile.

==Playing career==
Devoy turned professional at the age of 17. Her first World Open title came in 1985, with a subsequent win in 1987. Further World Open titles came in 1990 and 1992. For most of her career, the World Open was held biennially, a fact that stopped Devoy potentially doubling her tally. She did, however, win the coveted British Open eight times, a record behind only Heather McKay&#x27;s in the 1960s/70s and Janet Morgan&#x27;s in the 1950s.

In 1992, the year of her unexpected retirement, she was the Australian, British, French, Hong Kong, Irish, New Zealand, Scottish, Swedish and World squash champion.

=== World Open Finals: 5 (4 titles, 1 runner-up) ===
== Awards and honours ==
In the 1986 New Year Honours, Devoy was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to squash, and elevated to Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1993 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to squash and the community. She was named New Zealand Sports Person and Sports Woman of the Year in 1985. In 1990, she was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

In the 1998 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Devoy was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to sport and the community, becoming the youngest New Zealander since Sir Edmund Hillary to receive a titular honour.

== Post-playing career ==
In the October 2001 local elections, she successfully stood in the inaugural district health board elections for Auckland DHB on the Citizens &amp; Ratepayers-Now ticket. She resigned from that position in February 2004, citing concerns about limited political impact that DHBs have but also because she had since moved to Tauranga.

In Tauranga, she was the chief executive of Sport Bay of Plenty and held that position for five years.

In April 2009 an accusation was made that the testimonial Devoy wrote for Tony Veitch in support of the return of his passport was edited and used in his support at his sentencing for &quot;injuring with reckless disregard&quot; in relation to an assault on his former partner Kristin Dunne-Powell in 2006.

==New Zealand Race Relations Commissioner==
In March 2013, Devoy was chosen as the successor to Joris de Bres for the position of Race Relations Commissioner. She was selected by Justice Minister Judith Collins, who was later forced to defend the appointment, which was surrounded by some controversy, including concern over prior remarks by Devoy including in her role as a &quot;Bay of Plenty Times&quot; columnist. In particular, references were made to her criticism of Waitangi Day as a national holiday, and those who wear burqas in New Zealand. The Mana Party called for her sacking, and the Green Party said her views on Waitangi Day were &quot;embarrassing&quot;.

Devoy officially began her five-year job on 1 April 2013. During her first few weeks in office, Devoy was criticised for refusing to comment on a number of race-related controversies, including a tirade against Chinese immigrants by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters.

Through the remainder of her tenure, Devoy publicly challenged some politicians on their race relations positions. She said that politicians are role models and &quot;it’s my job to call them out&quot;. She said NZ First leader Winston Peters&#x27; retelling of Arthur Calwell&#x27;s comment that &quot;two Wongs don&#x27;t make a White&quot; was &quot;outdated rhetoric&quot; with &quot;no place in New Zealand&#x27;s future&quot;. When ACT leader Jamie Whyte equated Māori with pre-revolutionary French aristocrats, Devoy said it was &quot;grotesque and inflammatory&quot; to equate Māori, whose socio-economic status lags behind other New Zealanders, with aristocrats murdered because of their privilege. In 2015, some Chinese people in New Zealand were &quot;dismayed&quot; when Labour MP Phil Twyford released data equating &quot;Chinese sounding&quot; surnames with foreigners while Devoy opined that it was &quot;deeply offensive&quot; for Chinese children to hear MPs insinuating their Chinese sounding surnames meant they were foreigners when their families had, in her opinion, helped and continued to help build New Zealand. Devoy also criticised NZ First MP Ron Mark for telling Korean-born National MP Melissa Lee to go back to Korea if she didn&#x27;t like it in New Zealand. Devoy argued that New Zealand citizens born overseas are &quot;not second class citizens&quot; and &quot;have a right to an opinion&quot;. All politicians stood by their statements with Whyte calling for her resignation. Devoy also called on Prime Minister John Key to meet with New Zealand Muslim leaders as tensions in the Middle East continued to rise.

Devoy also spoke out against what she views as &#x27;everyday racism&#x27; regularly supporting those who have spoken out and encourage New Zealanders to &quot;not stand by&quot; while others are racially abused. Māori New Zealander Rikki Hooper was humiliated while shopping in her supermarket, while Muslims and Jews have also criticised abuse and attacks as have rugby players in Canterbury and taxi drivers in Southland.

Devoy regularly called for an increase in the country&#x27;s annual refugee quota, which at that time had remained unchanged since 1987.

In the wake of the November 2015 Paris attacks, Devoy and Hazim Arafeh, president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, released a joint statement condemning violent extremism and &quot;standing alongside all innocent victims of terrorism in peace, solidarity and humanity.&quot; Following the Christchurch mosque shootings in March 2019, Devoy called on New Zealanders to listen to the voices of vulnerable people, challenge hate, and &quot;stand up for human rights by letting Muslim Kiwis know that you&#x27;ve got their back.&quot;

Devoy&#x27;s term ended in 2018 and she was succeeded the following year by former Gisborne Mayor Meng Foon.

==Later life==
She currently lives in Tauranga. She is a supporter of a New Zealand republic. Devoy has supported charities including as New Zealand patron for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. In 2007, she appeared on &quot;Like Minds, Like Mine&quot; TV commercials in New Zealand to counter the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness. As a contestant on &quot;Celebrity Treasure Island 2022&quot;, where she was an intruder who entered the show partway through the competition, her chosen charity was The Aunties. In 2024 Devoy published her memoir, titled &quot;Dame Suzy D: My Story&quot;.

<doc id="448385" wikidata="Q658204" url="?curid=448385" title="Blowup">
<text>Blowup (also styled Blow-Up) is a 1966 psychological mystery film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, co-written by Antonioni, Tonino Guerra and Edward Bond and produced by Carlo Ponti. It is Antonioni&#x27;s first entirely English-language film and stars David Hemmings, Vanessa Redgrave and Sarah Miles. Model Veruschka von Lehndorff is featured as herself, and Jane Birkin makes her first film appearance. The film&#x27;s non-diegetic music was scored by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, and the English rock group The Yardbirds are seen performing &quot;Stroll On&quot;. The cinematographer was Carlo di Palma. 

The plot was inspired by Argentine-French writer Julio Cortázar&#x27;s 1959 short story &quot;Las babas del diablo&quot;, which was later retitled &quot;Blow-Up&quot; to tie in with the film. Set within the contemporary mod subculture of Swinging London, the film follows a fashion photographer (Hemmings) who believes he has unwittingly captured a murder on film. 

In the main competition of the 1967 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Blowup&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or, the festival&#x27;s highest honour. The American release of the counterculture-era film with its explicit sexual content defied Hollywood&#x27;s Production Code, and its subsequent critical and commercial success influenced the abandonment of the code in 1968 in favour of the MPAA film rating system. At the 39th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. The film was also nominated for three BAFTA Awards, including Outstanding British Film.

&quot;Blowup&quot; has influenced subsequent films including Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974) and Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Blow Out&quot; (1981). In 2012, it was ranked No. 144 in the &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; critics&#x27; poll of the greatest films of all time and No. 59 in the directors&#x27; poll.

== Plot ==
After spending the night at a doss house, where he has taken pictures for a book of art photographs, photographer Thomas is late for a photo shoot with model Veruschka at his studio, which in turn makes him late for a shoot with other models later in the morning. He grows bored and frustrated with the models and walks off, leaving them and the production staff in the lurch. As he leaves the studio, two teenage aspiring models ask to speak to him, but he brushes them off and drives off to visit an antique shop near Maryon Park.

Wandering into the park, Thomas furtively takes photographs of two lovers. The woman, Jane, is furious at being photographed and pursues Thomas, demanding his film and attempting to take his camera. He refuses, and continues to photograph her as she runs away. Thomas then meets his agent Ron for lunch and notices a man following him and looking into his car. Thomas returns to his studio to find Jane, who asks desperately for the film. They have a conversation and flirt, but he deliberately hands her a different roll of film. She, in turn, gives him a false telephone number.

Thomas makes several blow-ups of the film of Jane and her lover, which reveal Jane appearing to look worriedly at a person lurking in the trees with a pistol. Thomas excitedly calls Ron, claiming that his impromptu photo session may have saved a man&#x27;s life. He is then disturbed by a knock on the door from the teenage girls. They have a sexual encounter in the studio before he falls asleep. After awakening, he learns that the girls hope he will photograph them, but is distracted by a detail in one of his blow-ups. He tells them to leave, saying, &quot;Tomorrow! Tomorrow!&quot;

Thomas examines a blurred figure on the ground under a bush in the blow-up, which he suspects is the dead body of a man shot by the gunman. As evening falls, he goes back to the park without his camera and finds the body, but is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking. He returns to his studio to find it ransacked, with all of the negatives and prints gone except for one very grainy blow-up of what is possibly the body.

After driving into town, he sees Jane and follows her into the Ricky-Tick club, where the Yardbirds are performing the song &quot;Stroll On&quot;. A buzzing noise in guitarist Jeff Beck&#x27;s amplifier angers him so much that he smashes his guitar and throws its neck into the crowd. The crowd, previously disengaged, fights over the guitar neck. Thomas grabs the neck and runs out of the club, with much of the crowd chasing after him; once he is away from the crowd, he tosses the neck away and walks on. A passer-by picks up the neck and examines it, but also discards it.

At a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames, Thomas asks a cannabis-addled Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened. Instead, Thomas joins the party at Ron&#x27;s insistence and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He then returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone.

Thomas watches a mime troupe perform a mock-tennis match at the park, and picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players when asked. As he watches the mimes continue to play, the sound of the ball being played is heard. His image then fades away, leaving only the grass.

== Cast ==

Uncredited members of the cast include Tsai Chin as Thomas&#x27;s receptionist, Susan Brodrick as the antiquarian, Ronan O&#x27;Casey as Jane’s lover/victim in park. Jill Kennington, Peggy Moffitt and Donyale Luna appear as Thomas’ models. The Yardbirds (Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty, and Keith Relf) appear as themselves.

Piers Gough and Janet Street-Porter appear as uncredited extras in the nightclub sequence. Julio Cortázar, the author of the source short story, makes a cameo appearance as a homeless man. Real-life photographer Reg Wilkins, who was one of the inspirations for Thomas’ character, appears as his assistant.

== Themes ==

Antonioni&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Blow-Up&quot; is a &quot;thriller-suspense&quot; story revolving around the efforts of a young and successful fashion photographer in his struggle to determine whether a series of photographs he takes at a public park contain evidence of a murder. As Thomas persists, his quest leads him initially to question his technical mastery over the &quot;hidden truth&quot; recorded by his camera, then toward a confrontation with the realities of his life of &quot;material advantages, gained at the expense of ideals&quot;. Finally, he questions the reality of his own existence. Film historian Gordon Gow identifies the object in Antonioni&#x27;s use of suspense: 


In an interview at the time of the film&#x27;s release, Antonioni stated that the film &quot;is not about man&#x27;s relationship with man, it is about man&#x27;s relationship with reality&quot;. According to Gow, &quot;a mystery without a solution is instrumental to the theme of disorientation&quot; which is sustained until the final moments of the film, in which Thomas fails to resolve the contradictions and ambiguities that arise from his investigations and his own life. Thomas&#x27; fate is known and the audience&#x27;s suspense is resolved, but Antonioni leaves the meaning of the film open to speculation.

Gow considers two interpretations for the ending:

== Production ==
=== Inspirations and influences ===
The plot of &quot;Blow-Up&quot; was inspired by Argentine-French writer Julio Cortázar&#x27;s 1959 short story &quot;Las babas del diablo&quot;, collected in &quot;End of the Game and Other Stories&quot;, which in turn was based on a story told to Cortázar by photographer Sergio Larraín. The short story was subsequently retitled &quot;Blow-Up&quot; to connect it with the film. The life of Swinging London photographer David Bailey was also an influence on the plot.

=== Casting ===
Several people were offered the role of the protagonist, including Sean Connery (who declined when Antonioni refused to show him the script), David Bailey, and Terence Stamp, who was replaced shortly before filming began after Antonioni saw David Hemmings in a stage production of Dylan Thomas&#x27; &quot;Adventures in the Skin Trade&quot;.

Jane Birkin made her film debut as the blond girl.

=== Filming ===

Most of &quot;Blow-Up&quot; was shot on location throughout London. The film&#x27;s opening scene was filmed on the Plaza of &quot;The Economist&quot; Building in St. James&#x27;s Street, Westminster, a project by &#x27;New Brutalist&#x27; architects Alison and Peter Smithson that was constructed between 1959 and 1964. The park scenes were filmed at Maryon Park in Charlton; the park has changed little since the film was shot, although Antonioni painted the grass green to meet his requirements. Photographer John Cowan leased his studio at 39 Princes Place in Notting Hill to Antonioni for much of the interior and exterior filming, and Cowan&#x27;s own photographic murals are featured in the film. Other locations included Heddon Street (where the cover of David Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; would later be photographed) and Cheyne Walk in Chelsea.

The scene in which the Yardbirds perform &quot;Stroll On&quot; – a modified version of &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot; with new lyrics – was filmed in a replica of the Ricky-Tick club at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire from 12 to 14 October 1966. Janet Street-Porter appears in the scene as an extra.
Actor Ronan O&#x27;Casey claimed that the film&#x27;s mysterious nature is the product of an &quot;unfinished&quot; production. In a 1999 letter to Roger Ebert, O&#x27;Casey wrote that scenes that would have &quot;depict[ed] the planning of the murder and its aftermath – scenes with Vanessa, Sarah Miles, and Jeremy Glover, Vanessa&#x27;s new young lover who plots with her to murder me – were never shot because the film went seriously over budget.&quot; O&#x27;Casey had previously told this story to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 1967, where he stated that Dyson Lovell played the part of the murderous lover. Two scenes appear to give credence to this: first when Lovell is seen apparently tampering with Thomas&#x27; car, and later when he and Jane are seen following Thomas in a Rover 2000.

===Thomas&#x27; car===
Thomas drives a Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III &#x27;Chinese Eye&#x27; Mulliner Park Ward Drophead Coupé owned by DJ and television presenter Jimmy Savile. The car was originally painted white, then painted black by the production. Only about one hundred coach built Silver Clouds IIIs were made with the unique slanted headlights, and it remains an iconic element of the film.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Blow-Up&quot; premiered at the Coronet Theater on Third Avenue in New York City on 18 December 1966. 

MGM did not gain approval for the film under the MPAA&#x27;s Production Code in the United States. The film was condemned by the National Legion of Decency. MGM released the film through a subsidiary distributor, Premier Productions, and it was shown widely in North American cinemas. The film&#x27;s critical and commercial success played a major role in the abolition of the Production Code and its replacement with the MPAA rating system shortly thereafter.

=== Box office ===
Film writer Richard Corliss stated in 2007 that the film grossed $20 million (about $ million in ) on a $1.8 million budget and &quot;helped liberate Hollywood from its puritanical prurience&quot; in the process.

The film earned $5.9 million (about $ in ) in the United States and Canada in 1967.

=== Critical reception ===

Critic Andrew Sarris called the film &quot;a mod masterpiece&quot;. In &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, film critic Arthur Knight wrote that &quot;Blow-Up&quot; would come to be considered &quot;as important and seminal a film as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Open City&quot;, and &quot;Hiroshima, Mon Amour&quot; – perhaps even more so&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film a &quot;far-out, uptight and vibrantly exciting picture&quot; that represented a &quot;screeching change of creative direction&quot; for Antonioni; the magazine predicted it would &quot;undoubtedly be by far the most popular movie Antonioni has ever made&quot;.

Bosley Crowther, film critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called it a &quot;fascinating picture&quot;, but expressed reservations, describing the &quot;usual Antonioni passages of seemingly endless wanderings&quot; as &quot;redundant and long&quot;; nevertheless, he called &quot;Blow-Up&quot; a &quot;stunning picture – beautifully built up with glowing images and color compositions that get us into the feelings of our man and into the characteristics of the mod world in which he dwells&quot;. Even director Ingmar Bergman, who generally disliked Antonioni&#x27;s work, called the film a masterpiece.

Anthony Quinn, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2017 for the film&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary, described &quot;Blow-Up&quot; as &quot;a picture about perception and ambiguity&quot;, suggesting an association between elements of the film and the Zapruder film capturing the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy.

According to author Thomas Beltzer, the film explores the &quot;inherently alienating&quot; qualities of mass media, where &quot;the camera has turned us into passive voyeurs, programmable for predictable responses, ultimately helpless and even inhumanly dead&quot;. Bilge Eberi of &quot;Houston Press&quot; notes the contrast between &quot;the sinewy movements of the girls, their psychedelic jumpsuits and slinky dresses and multicolored minis&quot;, and &quot;the blurred, frozen, inchoate unknowability of the death contained within [Thomas&#x27;] image&quot;, which &quot;is a glimpse of the eternal and elemental ... that completely reorders, or rather disorders, Thomas&#x27;s world. As an artist, he can&#x27;t capture it or understand it or do anything with it. As an individual, he can&#x27;t possess it or consume it.&quot;

Roger Ebert described the film as &quot;a hypnotic conjuring act, in which a character is awakened briefly from a deep sleep of bored alienation and then drifts away again. This is the arc of the film. Not &#x27;Swinging London.&#x27; Not existential mystery. Not the parallels between what Hemmings does with his photos and what Antonioni does with Hemmings. But simply the observations that we are happy when we are doing what we do well, and unhappy seeking pleasure elsewhere. I imagine Antonioni was happy when he was making this film.&quot;

In his commentary for the DVD edition of the film, Peter Brunette connects it to the existentialist tenet that actions and experiences have no inherent meaning, but are given a meaning within a particular context. According to Brunette, this is demonstrated by the scene in which Thomas takes Jeff Beck&#x27;s guitar neck out onto the street: &quot;He&#x27;s rescued the object, this intensely meaningful object. Yet, out of the context, it&#x27;s just a broken piece of a guitar [...] the important point here being that meaning, and the construction we put on reality, is always a group social function. And it&#x27;s contextual.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 87% approval rating based on 54 reviews from film critics, with an average rating of 8.3/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 critics.

American director Martin Scorsese included &quot;Blow-Up&quot; on his list of &quot;39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker&quot;.

Films such as &quot;The Conversation&quot;, &quot;Deep Red&quot;, &quot;Blow Out&quot;, &quot;Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro&quot; and &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; have been inspired by &quot;Blow-Up&quot;.

=== Awards and honours ===

=== Home media release ===
Warner Home Video released a Region 1 DVD of the film in 2004. In 2017, the Criterion Collection issued the film on Blu-ray and DVD, featuring a 4K remaster from the original camera negatives, in addition to new bonus materials.

Informational notes
# Several people known in 1966 are in the film; others became famous later. The most widely noted cameo was by The Yardbirds who perform &quot;Stroll On&quot; in the last third. Michelangelo Antonioni first asked Eric Burdon to play that scene, but he turned it down. In an interview Sterling Morrison of The Velvet Underground claimed that Antonioni had also asked the Velvet Underground to appear in the film, and the band members were &quot;more than willing&quot;, but due to the expense of flying the Velvets over from the US, Antonioni instead decided on an English group. As Keith Relf sings, Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck play to either side along with Chris Dreja and Jim McCarty.
# After Jeff Beck&#x27;s guitar amplifier fails, he bashes his guitar to bits as The Who did at the time. Michelangelo Antonioni had wanted The Who in &quot;Blow-up&quot; as he was fascinated by Pete Townshend&#x27;s guitar-smashing routine.
# Steve Howe of Tomorrow recalled and wrote &quot;We went on the set and started preparing for that guitar-smashing scene in the club. They even went as far as making up a bunch of Gibson 175 replicas and then we got dropped for The Yardbirds who were a bigger name. That&#x27;s why you see Jeff Beck smashing my guitar rather than his!&quot; Michelangelo Antonioni also considered using The Velvet Underground (signed at the time to a division of MGM Records) in the nightclub scene, but according to guitarist Sterling Morrison, &quot;the expense of bringing the whole entourage to England proved too much for him&quot;.
# Janet Street-Porter can be seen dancing in a silver coat and red and yellow striped Carnaby Street trousers during the scene inside the nightclub. A pre-Monty Python Michael Palin can also be seen in the motionless crowd watching The Yardbirds.

<doc id="448396" wikidata="Q7921203" url="?curid=448396" title="Veregin">
<text>Veregin is a special service area in Saskatchewan, Canada. It is located 50 kilometres northeast of Yorkton, and 10 km to the west of Kamsack.

Veregin was incorporated as a village in 1912 and was named after the Veregin Station (built 1908), and misspelled by the railroad when it earlier built the misspelled Veregin Siding in 1904, named after Peter V. Verigin. The Veregin railway station is served by Via Rail.

== History ==
Veregin owes its existence to the Doukhobors, in the middle of whose 1899 block settlement, known as the South Doukobor Colony its future site happened to be, and the Canadian Northern Railway, whose new line (between Kamsack and Canora) crossed the reserve in 1904. The site of the future village of Veregin — which also happened to be the closest point where the new rail line came to the village of Otradnoye (some 10 km north of Veregin) where the residence and headquarters of the Doukhobor leader, Peter Verigin was at the time — was chosen as the place for the railway station to serve the Doukhobor reserve.

The new station, originally known as Veregin Siding, and since 1908 as Veregin station, was named after Peter Verigin.
(&quot;Veregin&quot; appears a common spelling variant of the surname &quot;Verigin&quot;, fairly common among the Doukhobors. In fact, the village name is spelt as &quot;Verigin&quot;&#x27; on the letterhead of Peter Verigin-led Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood in the 1920s, and, on occasions, in the report of BC Royal Commission of 1912.)
A new village started to be growing near the Veregin train station. Peter Verigin moved his residence and the headquarters to Veregin from Otradnoye in 1904. The BC Royal Commission report of 1912 mentions the village (spelt as &quot;Verigin&quot;) as the site of what it terms &quot;the head office of the Doukhobor Community&quot;.

Veregin soon became an important Doukhobor settlement in the region. Brickworks, grain elevators, a floor mill were built there.
While the early annual general meetings of the Doukhobor Community continued to take place in the village of Nadezhda, some 10 km to the north of Veregin, Veregin became the site of the annual meetings no later than January 1910.

When the Peter Verigin-led Doukhobor Community was legally incorporated as the Christian Community of Universal Brotherhood (CCUB) in 1917, the headquarters of the organization was based in the village of Veregin as well, even though the majority of the CCUB members had already moved to British Columbia by that time. CCUB headquarters remained in Veregin until its relocation to British Columbia in 1931.

With the bankruptcy of CCUB in 1937–38, the facilities owned by the community were sold or destroyed.

In 1980, the 1917-built Verigin&#x27;s mansion was restored. In 2006, it and a few other Doukhobor buildings have been designated a National Historic Site of Canada under the name &quot;Doukhobors at Veregin&quot;.

Two major fires in the community on January 22 and 29, 2004, threatened the viability of the village. Veregin&#x27;s status as a village was dissolved on December 31, 2006 when it was absorbed into the surrounding Rural Municipality of Sliding Hills No. 273 as a special service area.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Veregin had a population of 47 living in 28 of its 43 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 45. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="448401" wikidata="Q4862793" url="?curid=448401" title="Baron Segrave">
<text>Baron Segrave (Seagrave) is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created by writ in 1283 for Nicholas de Segrave, and the title is drawn from a village in Leicestershire now spelled Seagrave.

The 6th Baron Segrave had previously succeeded to the title of Baron Mowbray, and thereafter, the two baronies have remained united, apart from a period of about a hundred years. For several generations they were subsidiary titles of the Dukes of Norfolk, and in 1777, they both went into abeyance with the death of the 9th Duke of Norfolk.

The second creation, by writ was for Nicholas de Segrave of Barton Segrave in the County of Northampton in 1295, becoming extinct on the death of his daughter Maud in 1335.

In 1831, a new Barony of Segrave was granted to Colonel William Berkeley, later created first Earl FitzHardinge, but this creation became extinct when he died without an heir in 1857.

Despite this interlude, the original barony of Segrave was still in existence, and in 1878, it was called out of abeyance for Alfred Stourton, 23rd Baron Mowbray, some two weeks after he had similarly recovered the barony of Mowbray. The titles have remained united since.

<text>The Borough of Stafford is a local government district with borough status in Staffordshire, England. It is named after Stafford, its largest town, which is where the council is based. The borough also includes the towns of Stone and Eccleshall, as well as numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire Moorlands, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Cannock Chase, South Staffordshire, Telford and Wrekin and Shropshire.

==History==
The town of Stafford was an ancient borough, being described as a borough in the Domesday Book of 1086. Its earliest surviving charter was issued by King John in 1206. Stafford was formally incorporated in 1614 by a charter from James I, which also granted the right to appoint a mayor.

The borough was reformed in 1836 to become a municipal borough under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reformed many boroughs across the country. As part of those reforms the borough was enlarged to include the Forebridge area on the south bank of the River Sow, which had been added to the Stafford parliamentary borough (constituency) in 1832. The municipal borough was subsequently enlarged several times to take in the town&#x27;s growing suburbs, notably in 1917 when it gained areas including Tillington, and in 1934 when it gained areas including Baswich.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Stafford Municipal Borough
*Stafford Rural District
*Stone Rural District
*Stone Urban District

The new district was named Stafford after its largest town. Stafford&#x27;s borough status transferred to the new district from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor, continuing Stafford&#x27;s series of mayors dating back to 1614.

Many of the new borough&#x27;s parishes had been within the historic Hundred of Pirehill.

==Governance==

Stafford Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Staffordshire County Council. Much of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2022. Following the 2023 election a coalition of Labour, the Greens and local party the Stafford Borough Independents formed to take control of the council, led by Labour councillor Aidan Godfrey.

The first elections to the enlarged borough council were held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Stafford. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1974 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in May 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 40 councillors representing 23 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on Riverside in the centre of Stafford. The building was purpose-built for the council and completed in 1978. Full council meetings are held at County Buildings on Martin Street. Prior to the completion of the Civic Centre in 1978 the council had its main offices at Borough Hall and met at the Guildhall in Market Square, which had been built in 1935 on the site of an earlier guildhall. Borough Hall was subsequently converted into an events venue and the Guildhall was converted into a shopping centre, being largely rebuilt behind the 1935 frontage.

==Towns and parishes==

The main part of the Stafford urban area, roughly corresponding to the pre-1974 borough, is an unparished area. Nearly half the modern borough&#x27;s population lives in this area. The rest of the borough is divided into civil parishes. The parish council for Stone has declared that parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Eccleshall is also commonly described as a town, having held a market charter from at least 1154, but its parish council has not formally declared it to be a town, nor is it a post town. The small parishes of Ellenhall and Marston have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

The parishes are:

*Adbaston
*Barlaston
*Berkswich
*Bradley
*Brocton
*Chebsey
*Church Eaton
*Colwich
*Creswell
*Doxey
*Eccleshall
*Ellenhall
*Forton
*Fradswell
*Fulford
*Gayton
*Gnosall
*Haughton
*High Offley
*Hilderstone
*Hixon
*Hopton and Coton
*Hyde Lea
*Ingestre
*Milwich
*Norbury
*Ranton

*Seighford
*Standon

<text>Baron Stourton is a title in the Peerage of England, It was created by patent in 1448 for John Stourton. In 1878, the ancient barony of Mowbray was called out of abeyance in favour of the twentieth Baron Stourton. About two weeks later, the barony of Segrave was also called out of abeyance in his favour. Thereafter, the three baronies remained united. The formal title is Baron Mowbray, Segrave and Stourton.

The family seat, until 1717, was Stourhead.

The motto of the family is &quot;Loyal je serai durant ma vie&quot; (French: I will be loyal throughout my life).

<text>The United States Institute of Peace (USIP) is an American independent, nonprofit, national institution tasked with promoting conflict resolution and prevention worldwide. It provides research, analysis, and training to individuals in diplomacy, mediation, and other peace-building measures.

Following years of proposals for a national peace academy, USIP was established in 1984 by congressional legislation signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. It is officially nonpartisan and independent, receiving funding only through a congressional appropriation to prevent outside influence. The institute is governed by a bipartisan board of directors with 15 members, which must include the secretary of defense, the secretary of state, and the president of the National Defense University. The remaining 12 members are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

The institute&#x27;s headquarters is in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. at the northwest corner of the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial and Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It currently employs around 300 personnel and has trained more than 65,000 professionals since its inception.

==Mission==
The United States Institute of Peace Act, passed in 1984, calls for the institute to &quot;serve the people and the government through the widest possible range of education and training, basic and applied research opportunities, and peace information services on the means to promote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence.&quot;

The institute carries out this mission by operating programs in conflict zones, conducting research and analysis, operating a training academy and public education center, providing grants for research and fieldwork, convening conferences and workshops, and building the academic and policy fields of international conflict management and peacebuilding. On many of its projects, the institute works in partnership with non-governmental organizations, higher and secondary educational institutions, international organizations, local organizations, and U.S. government agencies, including the State Department and the Department of Defense.

==History==
President Ronald Reagan signed the United States Institute of Peace Act in 1984.

Spurred by a grassroots movement in the 1970s and 1980s, Senator Jennings Randolph joined senators Mark Hatfield and Spark Matsunaga and Representative Dan Glickman in an effort to form a national peace academy akin to the national military academies. The 1984 act creating USIP followed from a 1981 recommendation of a commission formed to examine the peace academy issue appointed by President Jimmy Carter and chaired by Matsunaga.

Robert F. Turner was the institute&#x27;s first president and CEO, holding that position from 1986 to 1987. He was followed by Ambassador Samuel W. Lewis (1987–1992), Ambassador Richard H. Solomon (1992–2012), and former congressman Jim Marshall (2012–2013). Kristin Lord served as acting president (2013–2014). Nancy Lindborg was sworn in as president on February 2, 2015 and served until 2020. Lise Grande was named the new president in October, 2020. She continued in that role until April 24, 2024. George Moose is currently the acting president.

In its early years, the institute sought to strengthen international conflict management and peacebuilding. In a 2011 letter of support for USIP, the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs stated that this analytical work has &quot;helped to build the conflict management and resolution field, both as an area of study and as an applied science&quot;.

Under Solomon&#x27;s leadership, the institute expanded its operations in conflict zones and its training programs, initially in the Balkans and, after September 11, 2001, in Afghanistan and Iraq. It also became the home of several congressionally mandated blue-ribbon commissions, including the Iraq Study Group, the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States, and the Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel. Today, the institute conducts active programs in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Sudan, South Sudan, and elsewhere.

In 1996, Congress authorized the Navy to transfer jurisdiction of the federal land—a portion of its Potomac Annex facility on what has been known as Navy Hill—to become the site of the permanent USIP headquarters, across the street from the National Mall at 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW, in Washington, D.C. Prior to its construction, the institute leased office space in downtown Washington. Construction of the headquarters building concluded in 2011.

===February 19, 2025 Executive Order===

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on February 19, 2025, stating that &quot;the non-statutory components and functions&quot; of a handful of governmental entities, including the U.S. Institute of Peace, &quot;shall be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law&quot;; instructing them to &quot;reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law&quot;; and to &quot;submit a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) confirming compliance with this order and stating whether the governmental entity, or any components or functions thereof, are statutorily required and to what extent.&quot; 

While some have interpreted the executive order as a move to terminate the institute, the United States Institute of Peace Act established the institute as an independent nonprofit corporation, and Section 4601(b) of the USIP Act provides a broad statutory mandate. Section 4608 of the Act limits the authority of the Office of Management and Budget to reviewing and submitting comments on the institute’s Congressional budget request.

==Budget==

USIP is funded annually by the U.S. Congress. For fiscal year 2023 Congress provided $55 million. Occasionally, USIP receives funds transferred from government agencies, such as the Department of State, USAID, and the Department of Defense. By law, USIP is prohibited from receiving private gifts and contributions for its program activities. The restriction on private fundraising was lifted for the public-private partnership to construct the USIP headquarters.

===2011 Budget debate===
An op-ed in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; on February 16, 2011, by Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz of Utah and former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner of New York, attacked funding for USIP as part of the broader debate about federal spending. &quot;The USIP is a case study in how government waste thrives,&quot; they wrote. &quot;The idea began during the Cold War as a modest proposal with $4 million in seed money. But the organization received government funding year after year essentially because it had been funded the year before—and because it had important allies.&quot;

Former U.S. Central Command commander Anthony Zinni wrote an op-ed, published in the &quot;New York Times&quot; on March 7, 2011, in support of USIP. &quot;Congress would be hard-pressed to find an agency that does more with less. The institute&#x27;s entire budget would not pay for the Afghan war for three hours, is less than the cost of a fighter plane, and wouldn&#x27;t sustain even forty American troops in Afghanistan for a year. Within the budget, peace-building is financed as part of national security programs and is recognized as an important adjunct to conventional defense spending and diplomacy. The institute&#x27;s share of the proposed international affairs budget, $43 million, is minuscule: less than one-tenth of one percent of the State Department&#x27;s budget, and one-hundredth of one percent of the Pentagon&#x27;s.&quot;

On February 17, 2011, the House of Representatives for the 112th U.S. Congress voted to eliminate all funding for the U.S. Institute of Peace in FY 2011 continuing resolution. Funding for the institute was eventually restored by both the House and Senate on April 14, 2011, through the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act of 2011.

==Organization and leadership==
The institute&#x27;s staff of more than 300 is split among its Washington headquarters, field offices, and temporary missions to conflict zones. The institute is active in some 17 countries, and in 2012 maintained field offices in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Baghdad, Iraq, as well as a presence in Islamabad, Pakistan.

=== Organization ===

USIP coordinates its work through seven main centers:

*Africa Center
*Asia Center
*Center for Civic Engagement and Scholarship
*Center for Thematic Excellence
*Gandhi-King Global Academy
*Middle East North Africa Center
*Russia and Europe Center

===Leadership===
===Board of directors===
The board of directors is composed of 15 members, 12 of which are appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate. These have appropriate practical or academic experience in peace and conflict resolution efforts of the United States, and may not be officers and employees of the U.S. government. Members are appointed to terms of four years, but they may continue to serve on the board until a successor is confirmed. A member may not be appointed for more than two terms on the board.

In addition to the twelve appointed members, the U.S. Secretary of State and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, or their designees from among their departments&#x27; Senate-confirmed officers, as well as the president of the National Defense University or, if designated, the vice president of the NDU, serve as &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the board.

No more than eight of all members may be affiliated with the same political party.

The board elects a chairperson and a vice chairperson from among its membership. A majority of the members of the board constitutes a quorum.

The board appoints the president of the Institute, for an explicit term of years, who serves as a nonvoting &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the board.

===PeaceTech Lab===
The PeaceTech Lab is a 501(c)(3) spun out of the United States Institute of Peace in 2014. It created the lab as a separate entity to further advance its core mission to prevent, mitigate, and reduce violent conflict around the world. The lab continues USIP&#x27;s work developing technology and media tools for peacebuilding. In real terms, the lab brings together engineers, technologists, and data scientists from industry and academia, along with experts in peacebuilding from USIP, other government agencies, NGOs, and the conflict zones. These experts collaborate to design, develop, and deploy new and existing technology tools for conflict management and peacebuilding.

PeaceTech Lab CEO and founder Sheldon Himelfarb has proposed that an Intergovernmental Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE) be established along the lines of the IPCC to report on, among other things, how best to address the fake news crisis.

===Convened tribes in Iraq===
In Iraq in 2007, USIP helped broker the initial peace agreement that is seen as the turning point in the war there. USIP experts were asked to assist the U.S. Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division in the reconciliation effort in Mahmoudiya, located in what was known as &quot;the Triangle of Death&quot; in Iraq&#x27;s western Al Anbar Governorate. USIP was seen as a neutral player that was able to convene Sunni tribal leaders, Iraq&#x27;s Shiite government leaders, and senior members of the U.S. military. Soon after the meeting, attacks and casualties declined significantly. The agreement led to a reduction of the U.S. military presence there from a brigade-level unit of about 3,500 soldiers to a battalion-level unit of about 650. General David Petraeus, the senior commander in Iraq, noted that the turnabout was &quot;striking&quot;. Petraeus also said that USIP &quot;is a great asset in developing stronger unity of effort between civilian and military elements of government&quot;.

===Iraq Study Group===

The U.S. government used USIP to help convene the bipartisan Iraq Study Group in 2006 that studied the conflict in Iraq and recommended ways forward. USIP facilitated the group&#x27;s trip to Iraq and hosted several meetings of the group. According to USIP, the group&#x27;s political neutrality made it an appropriate entity to host the group&#x27;s sensitive deliberations. The effort was undertaken at the urging of several members of Congress with agreement of the White House. A final report was released to Congress, the White House, and the public on December 6, 2006.

===Genocide Prevention Task Force===
In Fall 2008, U.S. Institute of Peace, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the American Academy of Diplomacy jointly convened the Genocide Prevention Task Force to &quot;spotlight genocide prevention as a national priority and to develop practical policy recommendations to enhance the capacity of the U.S. government to respond to emerging threats of genocide and mass atrocities&quot;.

The 14-member task force, co-chaired by former secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former defense secretary William Cohen, outlined &quot;a national blueprint to prevent genocide and mass atrocities&quot;. In December 2008, the task force released its report &quot;Preventing Genocide: A Blueprint for U.S. Policymakers&quot; detailing its recommendations and guidelines. &quot;The Economist&quot; praised it as a &quot;report steeped in good sense&quot;.

On August 4, 2011, U.S. president Barack Obama announced a proclamation suspending U.S. entry to individuals active in &quot;serious human rights and humanitarian law violations&quot; and called for the creation of an Atrocities Prevention Board to review, coordinate and develop an atrocity prevention and response policy, and incorporate recommendations provided by the Genocide Prevention Task Force.

===Preventing electoral violence in Sudan===

Ahead of Sudan&#x27;s April 2010 national elections (the first since 1986) and January 2011 South Sudanese independence referendum, USIP staff traveled to some of the more unstable regions to help prepare people for the elections.

===&quot;The Iran Primer&quot;===
&quot;The Iran Primer: Power, Politics, and U.S. Policy&quot; was in 2016 a &quot;concise overview of Iran&#x27;s politics, economy, military, foreign policy, and nuclear program&quot;. It convened 50 experts to discuss Iran&#x27;s evolving relationship with the West and &quot;chronicles U.S.-Iran relations under six American presidents and probef five options for dealing with Iran&quot;. &quot;The Iran Primer&quot; was edited by USIP staff member Robin Wright.

===Women Building Peace Awards===
In 2020 the Institute first organised the Women Building Peace Awards. The first four winners were Rita Martin Lopidia of South Sudan, peace coordinator Josephine Ekiru from Kenya in 2021, María Eugenia Mosquera Riascos of Colombia in 2022 and in 2023 the winner was Pétronille Vaweka from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Finalists in the contest have included Marie-Marcelle Deschamps from Haiti, Jayne W. Waithitu,disability rights activist Hamisa Zaja from Kenya and Irene Santiago from the Philippines.

==Headquarters==
In March 2011, USIP moved into its permanent headquarters facility at the northwest corner of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Designed by Moshe Safdie Architects and Buro Happold, the LEED-certified building aims to serve as a symbol of America&#x27;s commitment to peacebuilding. The building houses offices and staff support facilities, a library, a conference center, auditorium, classrooms, and a public education center. Officials broke ground for the new headquarters in June 2008 at a ceremony that included President George W. Bush, Senate majority leader Harry Reid, and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

==Publications==

USIP publishes a variety of topical newsletters, briefs, reports, guides, studies, testimony, and books related to peacebuilding and conflict management topics. It also maintains digital collections of peace agreements, oral histories, and information about truth commissions. The USIP headquarters is home to a public library that houses a collection of items related to peacebuilding, conflict management, and diplomacy. Its materials can be used on-site or requested through interlibrary loan.

In an interview with the politically progressive news website Truthout, Noam Chomsky described USIP&#x27;s decision to release the Trump administration&#x27;s 2018 National Defense Strategy on its website as a case where &quot;lacking a sense of irony, the bureaucracy is quite happy to caricature Orwell.&quot;

<text>Ivan Generalić (December 21, 1914 – November 27, 1992) was a Croatian painter in the naïve tradition.

==Biography==
Generalić was born in Hlebine near Koprivnica. In elementary school, painting lessons were his greatest joy and as a child he used to earn money. He mostly drew with pencil on paper bags and some of these sketches were seen by Krsto Hegedušić, at the time (1930) just a student of the art academy, later a professor. Hegedušić was impressed with Generalić&#x27;s work and organized Generalić&#x27;s first public art exhibition, held in 1931 in the Zagreb Art pavilion. Positive critiques and contacts at the time led to a new era of not only Croatian, but also world art as well.

After World War II, in 1945 he became a member of ULUH (society of Croatian artists). In 1953 he exhibited in Paris, where he lived and painted for a few months. In 1959 he painted &quot;The Deer Wedding&quot; - his most valuable work, according to followers of the Croatian naïve art world. His home and peasant life of that time was his inspiration. His subjects include weddings, farm work, seasonal celebrations and funeral processions, and his rural scenes often included political commentaries on the social injustices of his time. Due to his technique of using oil paints on the reverse of a glass pane rather than conventional canvas, his pictures have a unique reflective quality.

Generalić has a large number of followers, beside his colleagues who form the first generation - Franjo Mraz and Mirko Virius. His second generation followers are Franjo Filipović, Dragan Gaži, Josip Generalić, Ivan Večenaj.

<doc id="448429" wikidata="Q490829" url="?curid=448429" title="Jeff Baxter">
<text>Jeffrey Allen &quot;Skunk&quot; Baxter (born December 13, 1948) is an American guitarist, known for his stints in the rock bands Steely Dan and The Doobie Brothers during the 1970s and Spirit in the 1980s. More recently, he has worked as a defense consultant and advised U.S. members of Congress on missile defense. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Doobie Brothers in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Jeffrey Baxter was born in Washington, D.C., and spent some of his formative years in Mexico. He graduated from the Taft School in 1967 in Watertown, Connecticut, and was a self-described preppie. He enrolled at the School of Public Communication (now College of Communication) at Boston University in September 1967, where he studied journalism while continuing to perform with local bands. His freshman roommate was blues musician James Montgomery.

==Music career==
===Early years===
Baxter joined his first band at age 11. At the Taft School, he played drums in a band called King Thunder and the Lightning Bolts. While still a high school student, he worked at Jimmy&#x27;s Music Shop in Manhattan in 1966. At Jimmy&#x27;s, Baxter met guitarist Jimi Hendrix, who was just beginning his career as a frontman. Later, Baxter claimed to have sat in with the Hendrix-led band Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, when the regular bassist could not make the show. Moving to Boston to attend college, Baxter worked as a guitar technician and amplifier repairman at Jack&#x27;s Drum Shop on Boylston Street.

Baxter first reached a wide rock audience in 1968 as a member of the psychedelic rock band Ultimate Spinach.

Baxter joined the band for &quot;Ultimate Spinach III&quot;, their third and final album. After leaving the band, he played with the Holy Modal Rounders and backed singer Buzzy Linhart. He was using the moniker &quot;Skunk&quot; by this time; so far, Baxter has kept the origin of the nickname a secret.

===With Steely Dan===
After the breakup of Ultimate Spinach, Baxter relocated to Los Angeles, finding work as a session guitarist.

In 1972, he became a founding member of the band Steely Dan, along with guitarist Denny Dias, guitarist-bassist Walter Becker, keyboardist-vocalist Donald Fagen, drummer Jim Hodder and vocalist David Palmer.

Baxter appeared with Steely Dan on their first three albums, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy a Thrill&quot; in 1972, &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; in 1973, and &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot; in 1974. He contributed the guitar fills and signature solo heard on the group&#x27;s highest charting hit &quot;Rikki Don&#x27;t Lose That Number.&quot;

===With The Doobie Brothers===

While finishing work on &quot;Pretzel Logic&quot;, Baxter became aware of Becker and Fagen&#x27;s intentions to retire Steely Dan from touring and work almost exclusively with session players. With that in mind, Baxter left the band in 1974 to join The Doobie Brothers, who at the time were touring in support of their fourth album &quot;What Were Once Vices Are Now Habits&quot;.

As a session man, he had contributed pedal steel guitar on &quot;Vices&quot; as well as &quot;South City Midnight Lady&quot; on its predecessor, &quot;The Captain and Me&quot;. Baxter&#x27;s first album as a full member of the group was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Stampede&quot;. He contributed an acoustic interlude (&quot;Precis&quot;) and significant turns on slide and pedal steel guitar.

While preparing to tour in support of &quot;Stampede&quot;, Doobie Brothers founder Tom Johnston was hospitalized with a stomach ailment. To fill in for Johnston on vocals, Baxter suggested bringing in singer-keyboardist Michael McDonald, with whom Baxter had worked in Steely Dan. With Johnston still convalescing, McDonald soon was invited to join the band full-time. McDonald&#x27;s vocal and songwriting contributions, as well as Baxter&#x27;s jazzier guitar style, marked a new direction for the band. They went on to continued success with the 1976 album &quot;Takin&#x27; It to the Streets&quot;, 1977&#x27;s &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Fault Line&quot;, and particularly 1978&#x27;s &quot;Minute by Minute&quot;, which spent five weeks as the #1 album in the U.S. and spawned several hit singles; Baxter&#x27;s work on the album includes an extended solo at the end of the closing track &quot;How Do the Fools Survive?&quot;.

In early 1979, Baxter left the band, as did drummer and band co-founder John Hartman.

===Later music career===
Baxter has continued working as a session guitarist for a diverse group of artists, including Willy DeVille, Bryan Adams, Hoyt Axton, Eric Clapton, Gene Clark, Sheryl Crow, Freddie Hubbard, Tim Weisberg, Joni Mitchell, Ricky Nelson, Dolly Parton, Carly Simon, Ringo Starr, Gene Simmons, Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, Barbra Streisand, and Donna Summer. He has worked as a touring musician for Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, and Billy Vera and the Beaters.

In 1982, he featured on Spirit&#x27;s album &quot;Spirit of &#x27;84,&quot; released as &quot;The Thirteenth Dream&quot; outside of the US.

In 1984, Baxter played keyboards with Bobby and the Midnites&#x27; Bob Weir, Billy Cobham, Bobby Cochran, Kenny Gradney (&quot;Tigger&quot;), and Dave Garland at the Capitol Theatre in Passaic, New Jersey. That same year, he produced and played guitar and synthesizer on the band&#x27;s album &quot;Where the Beat Meets the Street&quot; on Columbia Records.

In 1986, Baxter joined James Brown and Maceo Parker on guitar for several North American tour dates.

In 1990, Baxter joined John Entwistle, Joe Walsh, Keith Emerson, Simon Phillips and relatively unknown vocalist Rick Livingstone in a supergroup called The Best. The group released a live performance video in Japan before disbanding. He also produced two albums for the hard rock band Nazareth, and also produced albums for Carl Wilson, Livingston Taylor, The Ventures, and Nils Lofgren. He was producer on the 1982 Bob Welch album &quot;Eye Contact&quot;. In 1991 Baxter also produced a documentary video, &quot;Guitar&quot; (Warner Brothers VHS and LaserDisc), in which he travels the world and interviews guitarists he admires. In 1994 he performed on the video game &quot;Tuneland&quot;.

In 1997 Baxter scored the movie &quot;The Curse of Inferno&quot;.

Baxter continues to do studio work, most recently on tribute albums to Pink Floyd and Aerosmith. In 2012, he appeared on keyboardist Brian Auger&#x27;s &quot;Language of the Heart&quot;, and The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;That&#x27;s Why God Made the Radio&quot;. He also occasionally plays in The Coalition of the Willing, a band comprising Andras Simonyi, Hungarian Ambassador to the United States; Alexander Vershbow, US Ambassador to South Korea; Daniel Poneman, formerly of the United States National Security Council and later the Obama Administration&#x27;s Deputy Secretary of Energy; and Lincoln Bloomfield Jr., former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs. On June 19, 2007, Baxter jammed with former White House Press Secretary Tony Snow&#x27;s band Beats Workin&#x27; at the Congressional Picnic held on the White House South Lawn.

===Other media===
Baxter appeared on the TV sitcom &quot;What&#x27;s Happening!!&quot; in the two-part episode &quot;Doobie or Not Doobie&quot; (1978) as a member of the Doobie Brothers.

Baxter worked on the animated TV series &quot;King of the Hill &quot; in 1997, composing songs for three episodes: &quot;Peggy the Boggle Champ&quot;, &quot;Hank&#x27;s Unmentionable Problem&quot;, and &quot;Square Peg&quot;. Also in 1997, he worked on two other TV series as a composer: &quot;The Blues Brothers Animated Series&quot; and &quot;The Curse of Inferno&quot;. He composed for &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Bedtime Stories&quot; TV series episode &quot;Bootsie Barker Bites/Ruby the Copycat&quot; in 1993, the &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; episode &quot;Tons of Fun&quot; in 1987, and the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; episode &quot;The Green Room&quot; in 1990. He is credited on the movie soundtrack for the feature film &quot;Roxanne&quot; (1987) as writer and producer for the songs &quot;Party Tonight&quot; and &quot;Can This Be Love&quot;. Other credits include music for &quot;Class of 1984&quot; (1982): &quot;You Better Not Step Out of Line&quot; and as a performer on &quot;Suburbanite&quot;. He appeared in the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; and can be heard on the cast album.

Baxter has appeared in a number of documentaries, including &quot;Jan &amp; Dean: The Other Beach Boys&quot; (2002), &quot;The History of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1995), &quot;American Bandstand&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Special&quot; (1995), &quot;Emerson&quot; (2013), &quot;Turn It Up!&quot; (2013), &quot;Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who&quot; (2007), &quot;Overnight&quot; (2003), &quot;The Doobie Brothers: Let the Music Play&quot; (2012), &quot;The Making of &#x27;Blues Brothers 2000&#x27; &quot; (1998) and &quot;Guitar&quot; (1991).

==Defense consulting career==
Baxter fell into his second profession almost by accident. In the mid-1980s, his interest in music recording technology led him to wonder about hardware and software originally developed for military use, specifically data compression algorithms and large-capacity storage devices.

His next-door neighbor was a retired engineer who had worked on the Sidewinder missile program. This neighbor bought Baxter a subscription to &quot;Aviation Week&quot; magazine, provoking his interest in additional military-oriented publications and missile defense systems in particular. He became self-taught in this area, and at one point wrote a five-page paper that proposed converting the ship-based anti-aircraft Aegis missile into a rudimentary missile defense system.

He gave the paper to California Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and his career as a defense consultant began.
Baxter received a series of security clearances so he could work with classified information. In 1995, Pennsylvania Republican Congressman Curt Weldon, then the chairman of the House Military Research and Development Subcommittee, nominated Baxter to chair the Civilian Advisory Board for Ballistic Missile Defense.

Baxter&#x27;s work with that panel led to consulting contracts with the Pentagon&#x27;s Missile Defense Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He consults for the US Department of Defense and the US intelligence community, as well as defense-oriented manufacturers such as Science Applications International Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc. He has said his unconventional approach to thinking about terrorism, tied to his interest in technology, is a major reason the government sought his assistance.

&quot;We thought turntables were for playing records until rappers began to use them as instruments, and we thought airplanes were for carrying passengers until terrorists realized they could be used as missiles,&quot; Baxter has said. &quot;My big thing is to look at existing technologies and try to see other ways they can be used, which happens in music all the time and happens to be what terrorists are incredibly good at.&quot;

Baxter has also appeared in public debates and as a guest on CNN and Fox News advocating missile defense. He served as a national spokesman for Americans for Missile Defense, a coalition of organizations devoted to the issue.

In 2000, Baxter considered challenging Representative Brad Sherman for the 24th Congressional District seat in California before deciding not to run.

In April 2005, he joined the NASA Exploration Systems Advisory Committee.

Baxter was a member of an independent study group that produced the Civil Applications Committee Blue Ribbon Study recommending an increased domestic role for US spy satellites in September 2005.
This study was first reported by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on August 15, 2007. He is listed as &quot;Senior Thinker and Raconteur&quot; at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, and is a Senior Fellow and Member of the Board of Regents at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.

<text>HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; was a heavy cruiser of the Royal Navy. The ship was the Lead ship of the Norfolk-subclass of which only two were built: &quot;Norfolk&quot; and . She served throughout the Second World War. During 1939-41 she operated in the Atlantic against German raiders and blockade runners. In March 1940 she was damaged by German dive bomber in the anchorage of Scapa Flow. 

In May 1941 &quot;Norfolk&quot; and her sister ship detected the German battleship and the heavy cruiser whilst on patrol in Denmark Strait. The two cruisers guided the battleship and the battlecruiser to the German ships, but in the Battle of the Denmark Strait on 24 May, &quot;Hood&quot; was sunk and both &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Bismarck&quot; were damaged. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; kept contact with the German ships and guided the Home Fleet to the scene. &quot;Norfolk&quot; directed a torpedo bomber attack from &quot;Victorious&quot; to the &quot;Bismarck&quot;, but these aircraft could only score one insignificant hit on &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Finally &quot;Bismarck&quot; shook off the shadowing &quot;Norfolk, Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales,&quot; and headed to port in France. When Bismarck was found back on 26 May, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was one of the few ships left with enough fuel, to continue the pursuit of &quot;Bismarck.&quot; In the evening of 26 may, torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier rendered &quot;Bismarck&quot; steerless, allowing her persuers to catch up. In the morning of 27 May, the battleships and , &quot;Norfolk&quot; and the heavy cruisers destroyed the &quot;Bismarck&quot; with gunfire and torpedoes.

From 1942 onwards she operated in the Arctic, usually as part of the close covering force of Arctic convoys to Russia, where she was involved in the sinking of the German battleship .during the Battle of the North Cape.

== Characteristics ==
&quot;Norfolk&quot; was laid down in July 1927 at Govan by Fairfield Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co. Ltd, launched on 12 December 1928, and commissioned on 30 April 1930. She was at maximum long overall, and had a beam of and a draught of . The cruiser displaced at standard displacement, in compliance with the tonnage restriction of the Washington Naval Treaty, and up to at full load. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was propelled by four Parsons steam turbines that drove four screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight oil-fired 3-drum water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at and produced a top speed of . The ship had a capacity of of fuel oil as built, which provided a cruising radius of at a speed of . She had a crew of 710 officers and enlisted men. 

&quot;Norfolk&quot; was armed with a main battery of eight guns in four twin turrets. She had a secondary battery consisting of four twin dual-purpose guns. The cruiser was to be equipped with multiple QF 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns, but these were not yet available when she was commissioned. In 1939 her light anti-aircraft armament consisted of two octuple 2-pounder guns and two quadruple Vickers AA machine guns. By 1945 this was modified to six quadruple 2-pounders, nine single Bofors 40 mm guns and eleven twin 20 mm guns. To compensate for the added weight of anti-aircraft armament and radars, the third ( &quot;X&quot; ) twin 8 inch turret was landed in 1944. &quot;Norfolk&quot; also mounted two quadruple torpedo tubes. 

The County-class heavy cruisers sacrified armour for speed and armament. As built there was no belt armour, but a belt was added before the war. The sides and the barbettes used plating, the lower deck , the turrets and only the ammunition magazines received of armour plate on the sides. 

During the war, &quot;Norfolk&quot; underwent five refits and repairs : April-July 1940, July-September 1941, February-March 1942, April-May 1943 and February-October 1944. On each occasion her anti-aircraft armament and radar equipment were updated with was available at the moment.

== Service history ==
===Inter-war period===
In July 1931, &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Devonshire&quot; were the first British Navy ships to visit the German harbor Kiel. In September 1931, the crew of the &quot;Norfolk&quot; were part of a mutiny that later became known as the Invergordon Mutiny. The ship later served with the Home Fleet until 1932 and was then Flagship of the 8th Cruiser Squadron on the America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, between 1932 and 1934. &quot;Norfolk&quot; left Bermuda on 21 November 1934 for England. From 1935 to 1939, &quot;Norfolk&quot; served with the Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, before coming home to refit in 1939, being still in dockyard hands when war was declared.

===Second World War===
At the outbreak of war in 1939, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was part of the 8th Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet. In November she was part of the Northern Patrol guarding Denmark Strait against German blockade runners and raiders. On 23 November the German battleships and &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; attacked the Northern Patrol between Iceland and the Faroe Islands and sank the AMC HMS Rawalpindi. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was involved in the chase for the two German battleships, but &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; retreated at high speed and managed to return to Germany in bad weather. In anticipation of a British reaction on the sortie of the two battleships, the OKM had organised a submarine trap East of the Shetland isles. In very bad weather, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was sighted on 28 November by which signalled a contact report and alerted the nearby under the command of the famous Günther Prien. Due to the bad weather, Prien managed only to launch one torpedo which missed, but Prien reported one hit, whilst German propaganda claimed the cruiser sunk.

In order to counter a supposed Allied invasion of Norway, the Germans executed a raid on 16 March 1940 with eighteen Junkers Ju 88 of Kampfgeschwader 30 and sixteen Heinkel He 111 of &quot;Kampfgeschwader&quot; 26 at the Naval base of Scapa Flow. &quot;Norfolk&quot; received a bomb hit on the quarterdeck which blew a hole in the hull and flooded the aft shell magazines. She went into repairs for three months. After these repairs had been completed &quot;Norfolk&quot; proceeded to a shipyard on the River Tyne for a new addition to her equipment – a radar set.

In November 1940, the German &quot;pocket battleship &quot; broke out into the Atlantic and on 5 November attacked Convoy HX 84 and sank five ships. Trying to anticipate every possible next move of the German raider, the Admiralty sent out ships to block a possible return to Germany, allocated battleships to convoy escort and organized hunting groups in the North Atlantic. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was sent out from Freetown northwards together with her sister ship and the aircraft carrier &quot;Formidable&quot; to block the raider from going to port in occupied France. When in December the appeared in the South Atlantic, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was ordered to Freetown as part of Force K on trade protection duties. On 18 January 1941 &quot;Norfolk&quot;, under the command of Capt. Phillips, acting upon a report from the AMC &quot;Arawa&quot; seeing in the far distance the gunflashes of the German auxiliary cruiser sinking the tanker &quot;British Union&quot;, joined in the search for the German raider together with her sister ship .
==== Bismarck ====
On 21 May &quot;Norfolk,&quot; under the command of rear Admiral Frederic Wake-Walker, was patrolling in the Denmark Strait against possible German raiders. When the British received news of an impeding attempt of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; and heavy cruiser to breakout into the Atlantic, the Denmark Strait patrol was reinforced with &quot;Norfolk&quot;&#x27;s sister ship , which was refuelling at Iceland. In the evening of 23 May the two cruisers were patrolling 15 miles apart when &quot;Suffolk&quot; spotted the two German ships. &quot;Suffolk&quot; could hide in the mist but when &quot;Norfolk&quot; made contact with the German ships she was spotted by &quot;Bismarck&quot; as well and the German battleship fired five salvoes at &quot;Norfolk&quot; before she too could escape in the mist. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; continued to shadow &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; with their radar and sent regularly contact reports, in order to guide a British force consisting of the battleship , the battlecruiser and six destroyers under the command of admiral Lancelot Holland to the scene. At midnight &quot;Bismarck&quot; suddenly reversed course and tried to chase the cruisers away. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; lost contact and as a result, Holland sent his destroyers away on a fruitless search for the German ships. When contact was finally regained Holland could close in on the German ships but now the British ships were approaching slowly on a converging course rather than the planned advantageous head-on approach. In the ensuing Battle of the Denmark Strait &quot;Hood&quot; was sunk and both &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prince Of Wales&quot; were damaged. Holland had not tried to involve the shadowing cruisers in his battle plan, the cruisers were too far away to close in before the battle was over. Only &quot;Suffolk&quot; fired a few salvoes which fell far too short.

Both cruisers and the damaged &quot;Prince Of Wales&quot; continued to shadow the German ships in order to guide the Home Fleet to them. During the afternoon of 24 May, &quot;Bismarck&quot; turned twice on her pursuers and had a brief gun duel with first &quot;Suffolk&quot; and then &quot;Prince Of Wales&quot;. With these diversions, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was able to slip away to continue merchant raiding independently whilst the damaged &quot;Bismarck&quot; wanted to head to the french port of Brest for repairs. During the night an attack with nine Fairey Swordfish was launched from the approaching Home Fleet. In bad visibility the aircraft detected &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 23:30 and the shadowing British ships with their radar, and made contact with &quot;Norfolk&quot; to get a proper heading towards the enemy. The aircraft scored one hit but this did not affect &quot;Bismarck&quot; much. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was trailing &quot;Bismarck&quot; with her radar on the port side. As the British ships entered the open Atlantic, they started to zigzag because of the U-boat danger. &quot;Norfolk&quot; had a fixed radar, not a rotating one, and was able to track &quot;Bismarck&quot; only during the first leg of the zigzag. When &quot;Bismarck&quot; turned away on 25 May at 03:06 to starboard and behind the trailing ships, the manoeuvre was detected too late and the British ships lost contact. The &quot;Norfolk, Suffolk,&quot; &quot;Prince Of Wales&quot; and the approaching Home Fleet fanned out to regain contact but the &quot;Bismarck&quot; had escaped. 

During the subsequent search for the &quot;Bismarck,&quot; many British ships had to give up the hunt because of fuel shortage and because they were searching in the wrong direction, thinking the &quot;Bismarck&quot; would either continue into the Atlantic or return to Norway. Wake-Walker anticipated &quot;Bismarck&quot; continuing to a French port and when &quot;Bismarck&quot; was found back on 26 May at 10:30 by air reconnaissance on her way to Brest, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was in a position to pick up the chase again. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was rendered steerless as a result of a torpedo aircraft attack the same day at 20:47 by the aircraft carrier from Force H. During the night &quot;Norfolk&quot; closed in together with the battleships and , but waited until the morning of 27 May to attack, whilst &quot;Bismarck&quot; was constantly being harassed by individual torpedo attacks of five destroyers under the command of Captain Philip Vian. &quot;Norfolk&quot; made contact with &quot;Bismarck&quot; at 07:53 but withdrew quickly waiting the arrival of &quot;Rodney&quot; and &quot;King George V.&quot; The British opened the battle at 08:47 and &quot;Norfolk&quot; joined at 08:54, firing from 22,000 yards. At 08:59 she scored an important hit on the foretop of &quot;Bismarck,&quot; putting her central fire control station out of action. At 09:10 &quot;Norfolk&quot; fired four torpedo&#x27;s from 16,000 yards which all missed. During the battle she fired a total of 527 8-inch shells, and carried out flank marking for the battleships. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was put out of action by 09:30 and finally sank at 10:40. After the battle &quot;Norfolk&quot; returned independently to the Clyde on 29 May and on its way she was bombed by one German aircraft but suffered no damage.

==== Arctic Convoys ====
When the German army invaded the USSR in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941, the British were decided to send help. A PQ convoy lane sending military supplies from the UK to Northern Russia was established by September 1941. From October onward, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was employed as an escort for these Arctic Convoys. Between 17 and 30 October she escorted the six merchant ships of Convoy PQ 2 to Arkhangelsk, in company of the destroyers and and three minesweepers. On 3 November the cruiser and the two destroyers escorted the twelve ships of the empty return convoy QP 2 back to the UK. From then on she was attached to the Home Fleet as part of a force guarding a possible breakout attempt of the German battleship into the Atlantic. 

In April 1942 &quot;Norfolk&quot; was assigned as close cruiser escort for the Convoy PQ 14, with the cruiser with the destroyers and , but she was unable to link up with the other ships and did not sail to Northern Russia but instead stayed in the vicinity of Bear Island from where she could support either PQ 14 or the returning Convoy QP 10. On 13 May &quot;Norfolk&quot; sailed again towards Bear Island as part of a cruiser force in order to cover the return of the damaged cruiser from Murmansk to home waters, but &quot;Trinidad&quot; was sunk by German bombers before they could reach her. Between 21 and 29 May she sailed to Kola Bay as part of the close cruiser escort for Convoy PQ 16 and the returning QP 12. By now, the Germans were opposing the passage of these convoys fiercely, but due to fuel shortages for their surface fleet, attacked mainly with aircraft and U-boats, so &quot;Norfolk&quot; was not much involved in the defense of the convoy. 

The next Convoy PQ 17 sailed on 27 June and again &quot;Norfolk&quot; was part of the close cruiser escort. Through intelligence the British learned that the German surface fleet had plans to intercept the convoy and the First Sea Lord Dudley Pound decided to recall all escorts and to scatter the convoy, resulting in the loss of twenty-three out of thirty-five ships of the convoy. Due to the heavy losses and opposition, the next Convoy PQ 18 was delayed until 7 September, when the threat of interception by &quot;Tirpitz&quot; had receded. The cruiser escort with &quot;Norfolk&quot; did not stay close to the convoy but patrolled in the area North West of Jan Mayen and covered the returning Convoy QP 14 as well. 

Arctic convoys were then suspended to free forces for Operation Torch, the Allied landings in North Africa in November. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and her sister ship operated during Operation Torch as a covering force near the Azores for the American landings on the Atlantic coast of Morocco by the Western Task Force.

In December 1942, the Arctic convoys were resumed. Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, insisted that these convoys were given protection against an attack by the German surface fleet stationed in Norway, by giving them cover of a cruiser force all the way to North Russia. The Home Fleet usually sailed as well but kept its distance. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was now usually attached to the Home Fleet or was on patrol around iceland. Only when the cruiser received severe storm damage, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was replacing her in the cruiser force for Convoy JW 53 during March 1943.

==== Battle of North Cape ====
In November 1943 the Arctic convoys were resumed again. The first pair of convoys Convoy JW 54A and Convoy JW 54B sailed unopposed, with &quot;Norfolk&quot; being part of the cruiser covering force, but on 19 December, Karl Dönitz told Hitler that the Kriegsmarine would attack and destroy the next convoy. Anticipating an attack by the German battleship &quot;Scharnhorst,&quot; the commander of the Home Fleet Bruce Fraser organized a trap : for the next convoys Convoy JW 55A and Convoy JW 55B, the cruiser escort consisting of the 10th Cruiser Squadron with the cruisers &quot;Sheffield, Belfast&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; would keep &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at bay and shadow her so that he could stay undetected at distance with the battleship and race to the scene when needed. On 26 December at 09:21 &quot;Sheffield&quot; sighted &quot;Scharnhorst,&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; opened fire at 09:30. &quot;Norfolk&quot; fired six salvoes and scored two hits on &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; in a brief gun duel, disabling the aft radar of the German ship. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; withdrew and escaped at high speed.

The cruisers were not able to follow but positioned themselves correctly on the other side of the convoy where &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; tried a second attack three hours later. At 12:10 &quot;Sheffield&#x27;s&quot; radar detected &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; at a distance of 12 miles and a second engagement developed. &quot;Sheffield&quot; was straddled by several salvoes but then &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; changed target and hit &quot;Norfolk&quot; two times. The first hit put &#x27;X&#x27; turret out of action, the second exploded midships below maindeck and killed six men. Fearing torpedo attacks, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; broke off the action and turned for port in Norway. The cruisers kept shadowing but first &quot;Norfolk&quot; and then &quot;Sheffield&quot; dropped behind with engine trouble. &quot;Belfast&quot; remained in touch with &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and guided &quot;Duke Of York&quot; to the scene. &quot;Duke Of York&quot; opened fire at 16:51, by 17:00 &quot;Norfolk&quot; had linked up and opened fire as well. By 19:45 the German battleship was sunk by gunfire from &quot;Duke Of York&quot; and torpedoes from the escorting destroyers.

After the battle of North Cape, Norfolk underwent a lengthy refit. On 11 January 1945 a British force consisting of the cruisers &quot;Norfolk&quot; and and four destroyers, executed a raid on Norwegian coastal shipping. Near Egersund they attacked a German convoy and sank two freighters and the escorting minesweeper M-273. Fighters from the covering escort carriers and repulsed a German counter-attack by torpedo aircraft. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was the flagship of Vice Admiral Rhoderick McGrigor off North Norway during Operation Judgement, an attack by the Fleet Air Arm on a U-boat base which destroyed two ships and on 4 May 1945, in the last air-raid of the war in Europe.

===Post-war===
&quot;Norfolk&quot; left Plymouth for a much needed refit at Malta, after transporting on 7 June the Norwegian Royal family back to Oslo after their five-year exile in London.After the war the large County-class cruisers with their large crews were too demanding on the available manpower of the Navy. Only the cruisers that had been extensively modernised during war such as &quot;Norfolk&quot; were retained in a training or staff role. Between August 1945 and March 1946 she was part of the 5th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies Station. In January 1946 &quot;Norfolk&quot; became the flagship stationed at Batavia. In 1949, &quot;Norfolk&quot; returned to Britain and was placed in Reserve. She was sold to BISCO for scrapping on 3 January 1950. On 14 February 1950, she proceeded to Newport, arriving on 19 February, to be scrapped.

<doc id="448436" wikidata="Q820961" url="?curid=448436" title="Berkshires">
<text>The Berkshires () are highlands located in western Massachusetts and northwestern Connecticut in the United States. Generally, &quot;Berkshires&quot; may refer to the range of hills in Massachusetts that lie between the Housatonic and Connecticut Rivers. Highlands of northwest Connecticut may be seen as part of the Berkshires and sometimes called the Northwest Hills or Litchfield Hills. The segment of the Taconic Mountains in Massachusetts is often considered a part of the Berkshires, although they are geologically separate and are a comparatively narrow range along New York&#x27;s eastern border.

Also referred to as the Berkshire Highlands, Berkshire Hills, Berkshire Mountains, and Berkshire Plateau, the region enjoys a vibrant tourism industry based on music, arts, and recreation. Geologically, the mountains are a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains.

The Berkshires were named among the 12 Last Great Places by The Nature Conservancy.

==Definition==
The term &quot;The Berkshires&quot; has overlapping but non-identical political, cultural, and geographic definitions.

===Political===
Politically, Berkshire County, Massachusetts, was formed as a governmental unit in 1761. It includes the western extremity of the state, with its western boundary bordering New York and its eastern boundary roughly paralleling the watershed divide separating the Connecticut River watershed from the Housatonic River and Hoosic River watersheds. However, like most other counties in Massachusetts, the active governmental role of Berkshire County has been abolished, so has no legal or governmental function.

===Cultural===
Culturally, the term &quot;Berkshires&quot; includes all of the highland region in western Massachusetts west of the Connecticut River and lower Westfield River. The cultural region also includes the Taconic Mountains bordering New York, which are geologically distinct from the Berkshires orogeny. Southwest Vermont and the Taconic region of New York are occasionally grouped with the Berkshires cultural region.

Sir Francis Bernard, the royal governor (in office 1760–1769), named the area &quot;Berkshire&quot; to honor his home county in England. In the present, the name of the modern American region is pronounced differently () to the modern English County ().

===Geographic===
Geologically and physically, the Berkshires are the southern continuation of the Green Mountains of Vermont, distinct from them only by their lower average elevation and by virtue of what side of the border they fall on. In physical geography, the Berkshires extend from the Housatonic River and Hoosic River valleys in western Massachusetts, to the Connecticut River valley in north-central Massachusetts, and to the foot of the lower Westfield River valley in south-central Massachusetts. In Connecticut, where they are referred to as the Litchfield Hills, they extend east from the upper Housatonic River valley in the northwest part of the state.

Geologically, the Berkshires are bordered on the west by the Taconic Mountains, the south by the Hudson Highlands, and to the east, they are bordered by the Metacomet Ridge. They are on the average lower and less prominent than the Green Mountains of Vermont, and form a broad, dissected plateau punctuated by hills and peaks and cut by river valleys. The Berkshires topography gradually diminishes in profile and elevation from west to east and from north to south, except where rivers have cut deep gorges and sharp bluff faces into the Berkshire plateau.

====Formation====
The Berkshires and related Green Mountains formed over half a billion years ago when Africa collided with North America, pushing up the Appalachian Mountains and forming the bedrock of the Berkshires. Erosion over hundreds of millions of years wore these mountains down to the hills that we see today.

====Elevation====
The average regional elevation of the Berkshires ranges from about . One of the high points is Spruce Mountain, at . The highest point in the Berkshires is Crum Hill at 2841 feet.

====Rivers====
The Housatonic River, Hoosic River, Westfield River, and Deerfield River watersheds drain the Berkshire region in Massachusetts; in Connecticut the main river drainages are the Farmington River, the Naugatuck River, the Shepaug River, and the Housatonic River.

====Counties====
The Berkshire hills runs through:
*Berkshire County, Massachusetts (far Western Massachusetts)

====Municipalities====
The largest municipalities associated with the Berkshires cultural region include Pittsfield, North Adams, Great Barrington, Williamstown, Stockbridge, Lee, and Lenox, Massachusetts.

==History==
During the American Revolution a Continental Army force under Henry Knox brought captured cannons from Fort Ticonderoga by ox-drawn sleds south along the west bank of the Hudson River from the fort to Albany, where he then crossed the Hudson. Knox and his men continued east through the Berkshires and finally arrived in Boston. This feat, known as the &quot;Noble train of artillery&quot;, was accomplished in the dead of winter, 1775–1776. 
The Berkshires is also home to Hancock Shaker Village, which is the oldest continuously working farm in the Berkshires of Western Massachusetts. Hancock Shaker Village is a landmark destination of 750 acres, 20 historic Shaker buildings, and over 22,000 Shaker artifacts. On the National Historic Register, it is one of the most comprehensively interpreted Shaker sites in the world.

==Ecology==

The Berkshires lie within the New England/Acadian forests ecoregion.

Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Massachusetts (Griffith et al. 1994) has defined six ecoregions within this area: Taconic Mountains, Western New England Marble Valleys, Lower Berkshire Hills, Berkshire Highlands, Vermont Piedmont, and Berkshire Transition. Each region is distinct from the others, providing a unique habitat assemblage.

Much of the Hoosic and Housatonic River valleys have underlying bedrock limestone and marble which contribute to calcareous wetlands unique in Massachusetts. The alkaline pH waters support a diversity of plants and animals intolerant of more acidic waters, some of which are state-listed rare or endangered. Combined with the rich mesic forests ranging from the northern hardwood to the taiga or sub-alpine, the Berkshires have a valuable, biologically diverse ecosystem.

The classic study of the vegetation of the Berkshire Highlands was Egler&#x27;s 1940 monograph, covering the flora of an area stretching roughly from Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in the west to Hatfield, Massachusetts, in the east, and from Goshen, Connecticut, in the south to the Vermont border in the north.

Today, efforts are being made by many organizations to preserve and manage this region for biological diversity and sustainable human development.

==Tourism==
The Berkshires have numerous shops, motels, hotels, museums, and trails, including part of the Appalachian Trail, large tracts of wilderness and parks Berkshire Botanical Garden and Hebert Arboretum The area includes Bash Bish Falls, the tallest waterfall in Massachusetts.

The Berkshire region is noted as a center for the visual and performing arts, many institutions which are associated with Williams College. The art museums include the Norman Rockwell Museum, the Clark Art Institute, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (Mass MoCA), Berkshire Museum, Hancock Shaker Village, and the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA). Performing-arts institutions in the Berkshires include Tanglewood Music Center and Boston University Tanglewood Institute in Lenox, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; the Bang on a Can Summer Festival for contemporary music in North Adams; Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox; summer stock theatre festivals such as the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Barrington Stage Company in Pittsfield, the Berkshire Theatre Festival in Stockbridge, and Berkshire Playwrights Lab in Great Barrington; and America&#x27;s first and longest-running dance festival, Jacob&#x27;s Pillow, in the town of Becket.

<doc id="448451" wikidata="Q1069905" url="?curid=448451" title="Cheng-Han">
<text>Cheng-Han (; 303 or 304 – 347) was a dynastic state of China listed as one of the Sixteen Kingdoms in Chinese historiography. Ruled by the Li clan of the Ba-Di people, its territory was based in what is modern-day Sichuan Province, China. The name Cheng-Han collectively refers to the state of Cheng (成; &quot;Chéng&quot;) or Dacheng (大成; &quot;Dàchéng&quot;), founded by Li Xiong in 304 (or by Li Te in 303) and the state of Han (漢; &quot;Hàn&quot;) founded by Li Shou in 338. The state is also less commonly known as Later Shu (後蜀; &quot;Hòu Shǔ&quot;).

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Li clan were originally Cong people from Baxi Commandery (巴西郡; in present-day Nanchong, Sichuan) in present-day Sichuan. When the Han chancellor, Cao Cao conquered Hanzhong in 215, Li Hu (李虎) led his family to surrender and migrated to Lüeyang Commandery, where they mingled with the local Di tribes. Their people became known as the Ba-Di, with “Ba” referring to their ancestral homeland. In 296, the Di chieftain, Qi Wannian, led a tribal rebellion against the Western Jin dynasty. The rebellion devastated the Guanzhong region, creating an influx of Han and non-Han refugees fleeing south into Hanzhong and Sichuan.

Among the refugees, the Li clan grew to prominence after the Inspector of Yi, Zhao Xin rebelled in 299. They joined him and served as key generals, but later overthrew him and took the provincial capital, Chengdu in 300. Li Te submitted to Jin in light of the Jin army’s arrival led by the new provincial inspector, Luo Shang, but from this point on, he acted as a representative for the influential refugee families in the region.

Tension grew between Li Te and Luo Shang due to an order from the imperial court demanding the refugees to return to their homes. The refugees were reluctant to make the journey, as the north was reportedly still unstable. Li Te negotiated with Luo Shang to extend their stay, but the latter soon grew frustrated by the delay and tried to force a move. In 301, Luo Shang’s forces attacked the refugees and began Li Te&#x27;s rebellion.

=== Cheng (304–338) ===

Li Te had much success against the Jin forces and reached the outskirts of Chengdu in 303. Shortly after, he declared a new reign era, which hinted his intention of founding a new state but was suddenly killed in an ambush. Nonetheless, his brother, Li Liu succeeded him, followed by Li Te’s son, Li Xiong. In 304, Li Xiong ousted Luo Shang from Chengdu, where he declared himself the King of Chengdu. His declaration is seen by most historians as the beginning of the Cheng-Han dynasty, although there is also the view that the state began with Li Te’s proclamation. Regardless, the Cheng was the first of the Sixteen Kingdoms to be founded, followed closely by the Xiongnu-led Han-Zhao dynasty in the north.

Li Xiong elevated himself to Emperor of Cheng in 306. Luo Shang, now commanding from Ba Commandery (巴郡; present-day Chongqing), continued to threaten Cheng, but after his death in 310, the Jin forces became disarray, allowing Cheng to dispatch them and consolidate their rule. Cheng became a refuge for people fleeing from the disorder in northern China, with some of them becoming officials in their administration. Notably, in 314, a group of rebelling refugees in Hanzhong surrendered the region to Cheng. Li Xiong and his family were also followers of the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, and Taoism was popular in Sichuan and Hanzhong. He appointed the Taoist hermit, Fan Changsheng as his Prime Minister, with his son, Fan Ben, later succeeding him.

For most of his reign, Li Xiong maintained peace and stability within his state, but issues arose following his death in 334. Intending to pass the throne to the line of his late elder brother, Li Dang, Li Xiong chose his nephew Li Ban to succeed him, a decision that angered his own sons. Meanwhile, the Cheng court was also divided on the direction of the state; as Cheng had many Han Chinese officials serving under them, and with the Eastern Jin dynasty firmly established in the east, some ministers believed that Cheng should be a vassal of Jin while others wanted to maintain its independence. In 334, shortly after ascending the throne, Li Ban was killed and usurped by Li Xiong’s son, Li Qi.

=== Han (338–347) ===
In 338, Li Qi’s father&#x27;s cousin, Li Shou forced him to abdicate and took the throne for himself. Li Shou renamed the state from Cheng to Han, named so after his peerage and wanting to distance himself from Li Xiong&#x27;s line. For this reason, historiographers collectively refer to Li Xiong and Li Shou’s states as Cheng-Han. Li Shou initially promised to only rule for a few years before submitting to Jin to appease the court but soon reneged on his words. Instead, he imitated his rule after the Later Zhao dynasty in the north by imposing harsher laws, taxes and corvee labor on his citizens and building lavish palaces.

Li Shou died in 343 and was succeeded by his son Li Shi. His reign was plagued by a succession crisis, a popular revolt by one of his generals and a sudden influx of Rau people entering his territory. The situation in Han caught the attention of the Jin commander, Huan Wen, who was looking to elevate his own prestige. In 346, Huan Wen set off to conquer Han, and in 347, he reached Chengdu and forced Li Shi to surrender, ending the Cheng-Han dynasty. Li Shi was sent to Jiankang, where he lived before dying of natural causes in 361.

<doc id="448452" wikidata="Q185726" url="?curid=448452" title="List of residences of presidents of the United States">
<text>Listed below are the private residences of the various presidents of the United States. Except for George Washington, all of them also lived at the White House (Executive Residence). For a list of official residences, see President of the United States § Residence.

==Private homes of the presidents==



This is a list of notable homes where presidents resided with their families.
==Presidential vacation homes==

During their term of office, many presidents have owned or leased vacation homes in various parts of the country, which are often called by journalists the &quot;Western White House&quot;, &quot;Summer White House&quot;, or &quot;Winter White House&quot;, depending on location or season.

===Summer White House===

The &quot;Summer White House&quot; is typically the name given to the summer vacation residence of the sitting president of the United States aside from Camp David, the mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high-alert protection of presidents and their guests.


===Winter White House===
A &quot;Winter White House&quot; is typically the name given to the winter vacation residence of the standing president of the United States aside from Camp David, the mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, used as a country retreat and for high-alert protection of the president and his guests.

Although Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had spent significant time in Florida (Harry Truman having spent time there in the summer), Richard Nixon&#x27;s Florida White House was the first that reporters called the &quot;Winter White House&quot;.

=== Western/Southern White House ===
The Western White House and Southern White House are terms sometimes applied to additional residences of the president, especially when those residences are very distant from the District of Columbia. Famous examples include Donald Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as well as George W. Bush&#x27;s Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford, Texas; Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan have also used the term for their private residences (Nixon and Reagan in California, Johnson in Texas).

===Other secondary &quot;White Houses&quot;===
The first governmental spending on property improvements of private presidential residences was at Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s Gettysburg farm, where the Secret Service added three guard posts to a fence. Federal law now allows the president to designate a residence outside of the White House as his temporary offices, so that federal money can be used to provide required facilities.

==Other official residences occupied by presidents==
===Official residences occupied while in other offices===
This is a list of official residences occupied by individuals who later served as presidents with their families while they served in the office related to the residence.

===Official residences occupied by presidents while another member of their family served in other offices===
This is a list of official residences occupied by presidents with their families (before or after their term of office) while another member of their family served in the office related to the residence.

<text>Baron Strabolgi (pronounced &quot;Strabogie&quot;) is a title in the Peerage of England supposedly created in 1318 for Scottish lord David of Strathbogie, 10th Earl of Atholl. Despite lack of evidence supporting its existence, it was called out of abeyance by the House of Lords in 1916. Whether it ever existed before then is open to serious dispute.

==History==
John of Strathbogie, 9th Earl of Atholl (–1306) was imprisoned, stripped of his titles and ultimately executed for fighting against the English crown, but his son David of Strathbogie, 10th Earl of Atholl had his titles restored by Edward II of England sometime between 21 August 1307 and 20 May 1308. He was made Constable of Scotland but stripped of his Scottish titles by 1314 by Robert the Bruce after rebelling against the Scottish king.

According to a 1914 House of Lords&#x27; decision, Atholl was called to the Parliament of England by hereditary writ under the barony of Strabolgi, inheritable by heirs general of his body. According to the Lords&#x27; decision, upon the death of David de Strabolgi, the third Lord Strabolgi in 1369, the barony fell into abeyance between his daughters and co-heirs Elizabeth, who married Sir Thomas Percy, and Philippa, who married Sir John Halsham.

In 1498, the barony vested upon a sole heir, Sir Edward Burgh, the &quot;de jure&quot; 4th Baron Strabolgi. It fell into abeyance again upon the death in 1602 of his grandson.

&quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; is incredulous of the 1914 House of Lords decision affirming that Atholl was called to Parliament as Baron Strabolgi &quot;despite the absence of any writ of summons for him to the English Parl of 20 Oct 1318 or genuine evidence of his sitting in it.&quot; &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; notes that &quot;even later writs of summons, however, were worded to &#x27;David (de) Strabolgi, &quot;comiti&quot; (i.e., &#x27;Earl of&#x27;) Athol;&#x27; rather than &quot;domini&quot; (i.e. lord).&quot;

&quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; declines to list it, on the grounds that it did not exist before the 20th century.

==Barons Strabolgi (1318)==

<text>The great bowerbird (Chlamydera nuchalis) is a common and conspicuous resident of northern Australia, from the area around Broome across the Top End to Cape York Peninsula and as far south as Mount Isa and Townsville. Favoured habitat is a broad range of forest and woodland, and the margins of vine forests, monsoon forest, and mangrove swamps. 

As with most members of the bowerbird family, breeding considerations dominate the lifecycle: females nest inconspicuously and raise their young alone, while the males spend most of the year building, maintaining, improving, defending, and above all displaying from their bowers. Only a male with a successful bower can attract mates.

The great bowerbird is the largest of the bowerbird family and is 33 to 38 cm long and fawny grey in colour. Males have a small but conspicuous pink crest on the nape of the neck.

==Bower==
The bower is a twin-walled avenue-type bower approximately 1 metre long and 45 cm high. It is typically located under a shrub or leafy branch. The ends of the bower are scattered with white and green objects - stones, bones, shells and leaves and small man-made objects such as plastic and bottle caps. Within the bower itself, clear glass is sometimes placed.

Uniquely among bowerbirds, groups of young males will attend a single bower concurrently, &quot;practising&quot; their bower-building skills prior to establishing their own bower for mating purposes.

== Display ==
The males most often perform their display at the north platform of the north–south oriented bowers. During peak mating hours in the early morning, this orientation reflects the most light off of the male&#x27;s bright lavender nuchal crest, showing off this impressive plumage. Usually the male will hold a colored object in his mouth while bobbing his head up and down during the display.

<text>Aeaea, Ææa or Eëä ( or ; ) was a mythological island said to be the home of the goddess-sorceress Circe.
In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Odysseus tells Alcinous that he stayed here for one year on his way home to Ithaca. Before leaving Aeaea, Odysseus was given instructions by Circe about how to cross the ocean and assisted by the North Wind to reach the underworld:
==Description==
Homer describes Aeaea as covered with a mixture of pasture and dense woodland of oak and beech. There were high hills or bluffs from which the sea could be seen encircling the island in all directions. Circe&#x27;s stone house was located in a &quot;dense forest of trees&quot; &quot;in a place that could be seen from far.&quot;

==Location==

The somewhat inconsistent geography of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; is often considered more mythic than literal, but the geography of the Alexandrian scholar and poet Apollonius of Rhodes is more specific. In his epic &quot;Argonautica&quot;, he locates the island somewhere south of &quot;Aethalia&quot; (Elba), within view of the &quot;Tyrrhenian&quot; shore (western coast of Italy). In the same poem, Aeëtes remarks on the great distance between Colchis (on the Black Sea, in modern Georgia) and Aeaea in these terms:
Aeaea was later identified by classical Roman writers with Mount Circeo on Cape Circeo (Cape Circaeum) on the western coast of Italy – about 100 kilometers south of Rome – which at that time may have looked like an island owing to the marshes and sea surrounding its base, but which now is a small peninsula. Dionysius of Halicarnassus wrote that it was already a peninsula in his time. However, it may have been still an island in the days of Homer, with a long &quot;&quot; or sandy peninsula that gradually became attached to the mainland – a common geological process. Archeologists have identified one cave or grotto on the cape as &quot;Grotta della Maga Circe&quot; (&quot;cave of Circe&quot;). A second cave was found on the nearby Island of Ponza. It is believed that Circe had her summer home on Mount Circe and her winter home on Ponza, which possibly was the island Homer called &quot;Aeaea&quot;.

The modern Greek scholar Ioannis Kakridis insists that any attempt at realistic identification is in vain, arguing that Homer vaguely located Aeaea somewhere in the eastern part of his world, perhaps near Colchis, since Circe was the sister of Aeëtes, king of Colchis, and because their paternal aunt the goddess Eos had her palace there. Cooper (1854, p. 266), in his edition of the Works of Virgil, comments on &quot;Aeneis&quot;: &quot;She [Circe] is here called &quot;Aeaean&quot;, from Aea, an island and city of Colchis, not far from the river Phasis. She married a king of Sarmatia, whom she poisoned, after which she fled into Italy ...&quot;

==Other hypothetical locations from literature==
Robert Graves (&quot;The Greek Myths&quot;) points out Aeaea as the island of Lošinj, near the Istrian peninsula in the north Adriatic Sea.

Fernando Jaume identifies the “Island of Circe” with Didyme aka Salina, the “erratic rocks” being the “Faraglioni di Lipari”, next to the “Island of the Sirens” and the “Hades in Sicily”, perhaps as many evocations of the volcanism of this archipelago. The narrow beach and the forests dedicated to Persephone would be there, in Acquedolci, and Sicily is the home of Circe&#x27;s father Helios&#x27;s sacred herds of oxen and sheep.

Tim Severin names in &quot;The Ulysses Voyage&quot; the island of Paxos near the Greek coast of the Ionian Sea. He describes it as the furthest west on a boundary of the sea and the river of Okeanos, the mythological freshwater river that encircles the Earth. Drawing upon this interpretation, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot; uses a fictional atoll point off the coast of Paxos as the location.

==Aeaea in literature==
In Richard Aldington&#x27;s novel &quot;All Men are Enemies&quot; (1933), Aeaea is the island, &quot;twelve hours from Naples&quot; (obviously mythical), where his heroes meet, and love between them flourishes.

John Banville&#x27;s 1993 novel &quot;Ghosts&quot; has a boating party shipwrecked on an unnamed island; one character, Sophie, speculates that it is Aeaea; another says, &quot;Yes...yes, Aeaea: you will feel at home, no doubt&quot;, a reference to Sophie&#x27;s Circean nature.

&quot;Aeaean&quot; was an epithet of Circe and her paternal niece Medea (), who were the sister and daughter of Aeëtes, the ruler of Aea () in Colchis. Circe&#x27;s son Telegonus is likewise given this epithet. It was also a name of Calypso, who was believed to have inhabited a small island of the name of Aeaea in the straits between Italy and Sicily.

==Popular culture==
* In the game, &quot;Hades II&quot; (the sequel to &quot;Hades&quot;), the Isle of &quot;Aiaia&quot; is a &#x27;safe location&#x27; where the Protagonist, Melinoë, can seek help from &quot;The Rift of Thessaly&quot; Biome&#x27;s &#x27;Helpful-Hand&#x27; character, her fellow sorceress, Madame Circe, stationed up on her private isle of Aiaia prior by Lady Hecate to be her eyes and ears there.

<doc id="448465" wikidata="Q4862207" url="?curid=448465" title="Baron Burgh">
<text>Baron Burgh ( or ) is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. 

The first creation was for William de Burgh in 1327, who was later Earl of Ulster, and both these titles later merged with the Crown in 1461.

The second, and still existing, peerage is of uncertain date. No Burgh sat in the House of Lords before 1529; the grandfather of that Lord Burgh had been summoned to the House in 1487, but did not sit; whether this was sufficient to create a barony by writ is debatable. This Barony was in abeyance for over three hundred years; when it was called out of abeyance, in 1916, it was accorded precedence as of 1487.

==History==
===First creation, 1327===

William de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster was summoned to the English Parliament in 1327 and 1328, by writs addressed &quot;Willelmo de Burgh&quot;, which, by modern law, would create a Barony of Burgh (; ). 

He was also summoned in 1331 as &quot;Comes de Ulton&#x27; &quot; (that is, Earl of Ulster) for a Parliament discussing Irish affairs. 

Insofar as these created English peerages, they later merged in the Crown when his descendant, Edward IV, acceded to the throne in 1461.

===Second creation, 1487 and 1529===
Sir Thomas Burgh of Gainsborough (; ), a distinguished Yorkist, was summoned to the Parliament of 1487 under Henry VII of England; there is no evidence that he attended. Some three weeks later, Henry VII signed a warrant ordering a writ to be issued for him, since the King intended to raise him to the pre-eminence of Barony, but no second writ was issued, nor was a patent. He was issued writs, but did not attend Parliament, for the rest of his life, until 1496; official documents call him a knight, not a peer.

His son, Sir Edward Burgh was never summoned to the House of Lords, although he was elected to the House of Commons in his father&#x27;s lifetime. In 1510, he was found a lunatic, being &quot;distracted of memorie.&quot; His wife was Anne Cobham, by modern doctrine Baroness Cobham of Sterborough.

In the third generation, Sir Thomas Burgh, Sir Edward&#x27;s son, was summoned to the first Parliament after his father&#x27;s death, and admitted on 2 December 1529. In the sixteenth century, this was treated as a new creation; Thomas, Baron Burgh, yielded precedence to the Barons Hussey, Windsor, Wentworth, all created 1 and 2 December 1529.

By modern law, the events of 1487 would not normally constitute a creation, for the elder Sir Thomas never sat as a peer; nevertheless, in 1916, the revived peerage was given precedence as of 1487. Sources vary, therefore, in calling the younger Sir Thomas 1st or 3rd Baron Burgh; this article calls him 1st, &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd.

===Abeyance===
The most prominent of the Lords Burgh, Thomas Burgh, 3rd Baron Burgh, grandson of the baron of 1529, was Lord Deputy of Ireland; when he died in 1597, he left four daughters, all of whom married and had children, and an infant son. When his son died at the age of eight, the barony of Burgh (according to modern law) went into abeyance between the daughters. By this, each daughter had a quarter share of the barony, which she transmitted to her heir; none of them holds the barony unless the Crown decides which of the four co-heirs is to have it; in this case it was not decided until 1916. (The first exercise of this power was in 1604, two years after the death of the young Baron, in the case of Baron le Despencer.)

The eldest daughter of the Lord Deputy, Elizabeth, had married George Brooke, who was executed and attainted in 1603, for his part in the Bye Plot against King James I; he was heir to Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, who was also attainted for his part in the Main Plot. None of this affected Elizabeth Brooke&#x27;s rights, and the abeyance was eventually resolved in favour one of her descendants; but her family was not welcomed by King James or his son: William Brooke, her son, was restored in blood in 1610, but not to the Barony of Cobham; he did not request the Barony of Burgh.

The second daughter, Anne, married Sir Drew Drury; the third daughter married Francis Coppinger, whose descendant has changed his name to de Burgh; the fourth daughter Katherine married Thomas Knyvett, who was also (by modern law) Baron Berners.

The inheritance of the Barony of Cobham and Elizabeth Brooke&#x27;s quarter of the Barony of Burgh is discussed under Baron Cobham; this is not the Barony of Cobham of Sterborough held by Edward Burgh&#x27;s wife, above, although the families are related.

===Inheritance and revival===
By the late eighteenth century, Elizabeth Brooke&#x27;s inheritance was again united in Sir William Boothby, 4th Baronet; when he died in 1787, the quarter of the Barony of Burgh, and the heirship to Cobham, passed to his only sister, Mrs. Mary Disney.

She had six daughters, three of whom had children.

<text>Several species of humans have intermittently occupied Great Britain for almost a million years. The earliest evidence of human occupation around 900,000 years ago is at Happisburgh on the Norfolk coast, with stone tools and footprints probably made by &quot;Homo antecessor&quot;. The oldest human fossils, around 500,000 years old, are of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; at Boxgrove in Sussex. Until this time Britain had been permanently connected to the Continent by a chalk ridge between South East England and northern France called the Weald-Artois Anticline, but during the Anglian Glaciation around 425,000 years ago a megaflood broke through the ridge, and Britain became an island when sea levels rose during the following Hoxnian interglacial.

Fossils of very early Neanderthals dating to around 400,000 years ago have been found at Swanscombe in Kent, and of classic Neanderthals about 225,000 years old at Pontnewydd in Wales. Britain was unoccupied by humans between 180,000 and 60,000 years ago, when Neanderthals returned. By 40,000 years ago they had become extinct and modern humans had reached Britain. But even their occupations were brief and intermittent due to a climate which swung between low temperatures with a tundra habitat and severe ice ages which made Britain uninhabitable for long periods. The last of these, the Younger Dryas, ended around 11,700 years ago, and since then Britain has been continuously occupied.

Traditionally it was claimed by academics that a post-glacial land bridge existed between Britain and Ireland, however this conjecture began to be refuted by a consensus within the academic community starting in 1983, and since 2006 the idea of a land bridge has been disproven based upon conclusive marine geological evidence. It is now concluded that an ice bridge existed between Britain and Ireland up until 16,000 years ago, but this had melted by around 14,000 years ago. Britain was at this time still joined to the Continent by a land bridge known as Doggerland, but due to rising sea levels this causeway of dry land would have become a series of estuaries, inlets and islands by 7000 BC, and by 6200 BC, it would have become completely submerged.

Located at the fringes of Europe, Britain received European technological and cultural developments much later than Southern Europe and the Mediterranean region did during prehistory. By around 4000 BC, the island was populated by people with a Neolithic culture. This neolithic population had significant ancestry from the earliest farming communities in Anatolia, indicating that a major migration accompanied farming. The beginning of the Bronze Age and the Bell Beaker culture was marked by an even greater population turnover, this time displacing more than 90% of Britain&#x27;s neolithic ancestry in the process. This is documented by recent ancient DNA studies which demonstrate that the immigrants had large amounts of Bronze-Age Eurasian Steppe ancestry, associated with the spread of Indo-European languages and the Yamnaya culture.

No written language of the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain is known; therefore, the history, culture and way of life of pre-Roman Britain are known mainly through archaeological finds. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that ancient Britons were involved in extensive maritime trade and cultural links with the rest of Europe from the Neolithic onwards, especially by exporting tin that was in abundant supply. Although the main evidence for the period is archaeological, available genetic evidence is increasing, and views of British prehistory are evolving accordingly. Julius Caesar&#x27;s first invasion of Britain in 55 BC is regarded as the start of recorded protohistory although some historical information is available from before then.

==Stone Age==
===Palaeolithic===

Palaeolithic (Old Stone Age) Britain is the period of the earliest known occupation of Britain by humans. This huge period saw many changes in the environment, encompassing several glacial and interglacial episodes greatly affecting human settlement in the region. Providing dating for this distant period is difficult and contentious. The inhabitants of the region at this time were bands of hunter-gatherers who roamed Northern Europe following herds of animals, or who supported themselves by fishing.

====First trace of human settlement at Happisburgh====
There is evidence from animal bones and flint tools found in coastal deposits near Happisburgh in Norfolk that early humans were present in Britain over 800,000 years ago. The archaeological site at Happisburgh lies underneath glacial sediments from the Anglian glaciation of 450,000 years ago. Paleo magnetic analysis shows that the sediments in which the stone tools were found have a reversed polarity- which means they are at least 780,000 years old. Plant remains as well as the presence of extinct species of vole, mammoth, red deer, horse and elk indicate a date between 780,000 and 990,000 years old. The evidence is that the early humans were there towards the end of an interglacial during that date range. There are two candidate interglacials - one between 970,000 and 935,000 years ago and the second from 865,000 and 815,000 years ago. Numerous footprints dating to more than 800,000 years ago were found on the beach at Happisburgh in 2013 of a mixed group of adult males, females and children. However there are no human fossils found. &quot;Homo antecessor&quot; is the most likely candidate species of ancient human as there are remains of roughly the same age at Gran Dolina at Atapuerca. &quot;Homo antecessor&quot; lived before the ancestors of Neanderthals split from the ancestors of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; 600,000 years ago.

Summer temperatures at Happisburgh were an average of 16-17 degrees C (60.8-61.6 degrees F) and average winter temperatures were slightly colder than present day temperatures, around freezing point or just below. Conditions were comparable to present-day southern Scandinavia. It is not established how early humans at Happisburgh would have been able to deal with the cold winters. It is possible that they migrated southwards during the winter but the distances are large. No evidence has been found for the use of fire during that period.

At this time, Britain was a peninsula of Europe, connected by a chalk ridge running across to northern France and the English Channel did not yet exist. There were two main rivers in eastern Britain: the Bytham River, flowing east from the English Midlands and then across the north of East Anglia, and the River Thames, which then flowed further north than today. Early humans may have followed the Rhine and thence around the huge north-facing bay into which the Thames and Bytham also flowed. Humans in Happisburgh were in a great valley downstream from the joining of the two great rivers.

Reconstructing this ancient environment has provided clues to the route first visitors took to arrive at what was then a peninsula of the Eurasian continent. Archaeologists have found a string of early sites located close to the route of a now lost watercourse named the Bytham River which indicate that it was exploited as the earliest route west into Britain.

====Settlement at Pakefield====
Chronologically, the next evidence of human occupation is at Pakefield on the outskirts of Lowestoft in Suffolk 48 kilometres south of Happisburgh. They were in the lower Bytham river, and not the Thames which had now moved further south. Pakefield had mild winters and warm summers with average July temperatures of between 18 and 23 degrees C (64.4 and 73.4 degrees F). There were wet winters and drier summers. Animal bones found in the area include those of rhinos, hippos, extinct elephants, giant deer, hyaenas, lions, and sabre-toothed cats.

Sites such as Boxgrove in Sussex illustrate the later arrival in the archaeological record of an archaic &quot;Homo&quot; species called &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; around 500,000 years ago. These early peoples made Acheulean flint tools (hand axes) and hunted the large native mammals of the period. One hypothesis is that they drove elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses over the tops of cliffs or into bogs to more easily kill them.

The extreme cold of the following Anglian Stage is likely to have driven humans out of Britain altogether and the region does not appear to have been occupied again until the ice receded during the Hoxnian Stage. This warmer time period lasted from around 424,000 until 374,000 years ago and saw the Clactonian flint tool industry develop at sites such as Swanscombe in Kent. The period has produced a rich and widespread distribution of sites by Palaeolithic standards, although uncertainty over the relationship between the Clactonian and Acheulean industries is still unresolved.

Britain was populated only intermittently, and even during periods of occupation may have reproduced below replacement level and needed immigration from elsewhere to maintain numbers. According to Paul Pettitt and Mark White:
:The British Lower Palaeolithic (and equally that of much of northern Europe) is thus a long record of abandonment and colonisation, and a very short record of residency. The sad but inevitable conclusion of this must be that Britain has little role to play in any understanding of long-term human evolution and its cultural history is largely a broken record dependent on external introductions and insular developments that ultimately lead nowhere. Britain, therefore, was an island of the living dead.

This period also saw Levallois flint tools introduced, possibly by humans arriving from Africa. However, finds from Swanscombe and Botany Pit in Purfleet support Levallois technology being a European rather than African introduction. The more advanced flint technology permitted more efficient hunting and therefore made Britain a more worthwhile place to remain until the following period of cooling known as the Wolstonian Stage, 352,000–130,000 years ago. Britain first became an island about 350,000 years ago.

230,000 years BP the landscape was reachable and Early Neanderthal remains discovered at the Pontnewydd Cave in Wales have been dated to 230,000 BP, and are the most north westerly Neanderthal remains found anywhere in the world.

The next glaciation closed in and by about 180,000 years ago Britain no longer had humans. About 130,000 years ago there was an interglacial period even warmer than today, which lasted 15,000 years. There were lions, elephants hyenas and hippos as well as deer. There were no humans. Possibly humans were too sparse at that time. Until c.60,000 years ago there is no evidence of human occupation in Britain, probably due to inhospitable cold in some periods, Britain being cut off as an island in others, and the neighbouring areas of north-west Europe being unoccupied by hominins at times when Britain was both accessible and hospitable.

This period is often divided into three subperiods: the Early Upper Palaeolithic (before the main glacial period), the Middle-Upper Palaeolithic (the main glacial period) and the Late Upper Palaeolithic (after the main glacial period). There was limited Neanderthal occupation of Britain in marine isotope stage 3 between about 60,000 and 42,000 years BP. Britain had its own unique variety of late Neanderthal handaxe, the bout-coupé, so seasonal migration between Britain and the continent is unlikely, but the main occupation may have been in the now submerged area of Doggerland, with summer migrations to Britain in warmer periods. La Cotte de St Brelade in Jersey is the only site in the British Isles to have produced late Neanderthal fossils.

The earliest evidence for modern humans in North West Europe is a jawbone discovered in England at Kents Cavern in 1927, which was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old. The most famous example from this period is the burial of the &quot;Red Lady of Paviland&quot; (actually now known to be a man) in modern-day coastal South Wales, which was dated in 2009 to be 33,000 years old. The distribution of finds shows that humans in this period preferred the uplands of Wales and northern and western England to the flatter areas of eastern England. Their stone tools are similar to those of the same age found in Belgium and far north-east France, and very different from those in north-west France. At a time when Britain was not an island, hunter gatherers may have followed migrating herds of reindeer from Belgium and north-east France across the giant Channel River.

The climatic deterioration which culminated in the Last Glacial Maximum, between about 26,500 and 19,000–20,000 years ago, drove humans out of Britain, and there is no evidence of occupation for around 18,000 years after c.33,000 years BP. Sites such as Cathole Cave in Swansea County dated at 14,500BP, Creswell Crags on the border between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire at 12,800BP and Gough&#x27;s Cave in Somerset 12,000 years BP, provide evidence suggesting that humans returned to Britain towards the end of this ice age during a warm period from 14,700 to 12,900 years ago (the Bølling-Allerød interstadial known as the &quot;Windermere Interstadial&quot; in Britain), although further extremes of cold right before the final thaw may have caused them to leave again and then return repeatedly. The environment during this ice age period would have been largely treeless tundra, eventually replaced by a gradually warmer climate, perhaps reaching 17 degrees Celsius (62.6 Fahrenheit) in summer, encouraging the expansion of birch trees as well as shrub and grasses.

The first distinct culture of the Upper Palaeolithic in Britain is what archaeologists call the Creswellian industry, with leaf-shaped points probably used as arrowheads. It produced more refined flint tools but also made use of bone, antler, shell, amber, animal teeth, and mammoth ivory. These were fashioned into tools but also jewellery and rods of uncertain purpose. Flint seems to have been brought into areas with limited local resources; the stone tools found in the caves of Devon, such as Kent&#x27;s Cavern, seem to have been sourced from Salisbury Plain, 100 miles (161 km) east. This is interpreted as meaning that the early inhabitants of Britain were highly mobile, roaming over wide distances and carrying &#x27;toolkits&#x27; of flint blades with them rather than heavy, unworked flint nodules, or else improvising tools extemporaneously. The possibility that groups also travelled to meet and exchange goods or sent out dedicated expeditions to source flint has also been suggested.

The dominant food species were equines (&quot;Equus ferus&quot;) and red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;), although other mammals ranging from hares to mammoth were also hunted, including rhino and hyena. From the limited evidence available, burial seemed to involve skinning and dismembering a corpse with the bones placed in caves. This suggests a practice of excarnation and secondary burial, and possibly some form of ritual cannibalism. Artistic expression seems to have been mostly limited to engraved bone, although the cave art at Creswell Crags and Mendip caves are notable exceptions.

Between about 12,890 and 11,650 years ago Britain returned to glacial conditions during the Younger Dryas, and may have been unoccupied for periods.

===Mesolithic===
(c. 9,000 to 4,300 BC)
The Younger Dryas was followed by the Holocene, which began around 9,700 BC, and continues to the present. There was then limited occupation by Ahrensburgian hunter gatherers, but this came to an end when there was a final downturn in temperature which lasted from around 9,400 to 9,200 BC. Mesolithic people occupied Britain by around 9,000 BC, and it has been occupied ever since. By 8000 BC temperatures were higher than today, and birch woodlands spread rapidly, but there was a cold spell around 6,200 BC which lasted about 150 years. The plains of Doggerland were thought to have finally been submerged around 6500 to 6000 BC, but recent evidence suggests that the bridge may have lasted until between 5800 and 5400 BC, and possibly as late as 3800 BC.

The warmer climate changed the arctic environment to one of pine, birch and alder forest; this less open landscape was less conducive to the large herds of reindeer and wild horse that had previously sustained humans. Those animals were replaced in people&#x27;s diets by pig and less social animals such as elk, red deer, roe deer, wild boar and aurochs (wild cattle), which would have required different hunting techniques. Tools changed to incorporate barbs which could snag the flesh of an animal, making it harder for it to escape alive. Tiny microliths were developed for hafting onto harpoons and spears. Woodworking tools such as adzes appear in the archaeological record, although some flint blade types remained similar to their Palaeolithic predecessors. The dog was domesticated because of its benefits during hunting, and the wetland environments created by the warmer weather would have been a rich source of fish and game. Wheat of a variety grown in the Middle East was present on the Isle of Wight at the Bouldnor Cliff Mesolithic Village dating from about 6,000 BC.

It is likely that these environmental changes were accompanied by social changes. Humans spread and reached the far north of Scotland during this period. Sites from the British Mesolithic include the Mendips, Star Carr in Yorkshire and Oronsay in the Inner Hebrides. Excavations at Howick in Northumberland uncovered evidence of a large circular building dating to c. 7600 BC which is interpreted as a dwelling. A further example has also been identified at Deepcar in Sheffield, and a building dating to c. 8500 BC was discovered at the Star Carr site. A group of 25 pits, aligned with a watercourse, laid out in straight lines, up to 500 metres long, has been found at Linmere, Bedfordshire. The older view of Mesolithic Britons as nomadic is now being replaced with a more complex picture of seasonal occupation or, in some cases, permanent occupation. Travel distances seem to have become shorter, typically with movement between high and low ground.

In 1997, DNA analysis was carried out on a tooth of Cheddar Man, human remains dated to c. 7150 BC found in Gough&#x27;s Cave at Cheddar Gorge. His mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) belonged to Haplogroup U5. Within modern European populations, U5 is now concentrated in North-East Europe, among members of the Sami people, Finns, and Estonians. This distribution and the age of the haplogroup indicate that individuals belonging to U5 were among the first people to resettle Northern Europe, following the retreat of ice sheets from the Last Glacial Maximum, about 10,000 years ago. It has also been found in other Mesolithic remains in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, France and Spain. Members of U5 may have been one of the most common haplogroups in Europe, before the spread of agriculture from the Middle East.

Though the Mesolithic environment was bounteous, the rising population and the ancient Britons&#x27; success in exploiting it eventually led to local exhaustion of many natural resources. The remains of a Mesolithic elk found caught in a bog at Poulton-le-Fylde in Lancashire show that it had been wounded by hunters and escaped on three occasions, indicating hunting during the Mesolithic. A few Neolithic monuments overlie Mesolithic sites but little continuity can be demonstrated.
Farming of crops and domestic animals was adopted in Britain around 4500 BC, at least partly because of the need for reliable food sources.
The climate had been warming since the later Mesolithic and continued to improve, replacing the earlier pine forests with woodland.

===Neolithic===

(c. 4,300 to 2,000 BC)

The Neolithic was the period of domestication of plants and animals, but the arrival of a Neolithic package of farming and a sedentary lifestyle is increasingly giving way to a more complex view of the changes and continuities in practices that can be observed from the Mesolithic period onwards. For example, the development of Neolithic monumental architecture, apparently venerating the dead, may represent more comprehensive social and ideological changes involving new interpretations of time, ancestry, community and identity.

In any case, the Neolithic Revolution, as it is called, introduced a more settled way of life and ultimately led to societies becoming divided into differing groups of farmers, artisans and leaders. Forest clearances were undertaken to provide room for cereal cultivation and animal herds. Native cattle and pigs were reared whilst sheep and goats were later introduced from the continent, as were the wheats and barleys grown in Britain. However, only a few actual settlement sites are known in Britain, unlike the continent. Cave occupation was common at this time.

The construction of the earliest earthwork sites in Britain began during the early Neolithic (c. 4400 BC – 3300 BC) in the form of long barrows used for communal burial and the first causewayed enclosures, sites which have parallels on the continent. The former may be derived from the long house, although no long house villages have been found in Britain — only individual examples. The stone-built houses on Orkney — such as those at Skara Brae — are, however, indicators of some nucleated settlement in Britain. Evidence of growing mastery over the environment is embodied in the Sweet Track, a wooden trackway built to cross the marshes of the Somerset Levels and dated to 3807 BC. Leaf-shaped arrowheads, round-based pottery types and the beginnings of polished axe production are common indicators of the period. Evidence of the use of cow&#x27;s milk comes from analysis of pottery contents found beside the Sweet Track. According to archaeological evidence from North Yorkshire, salt was being produced by evaporation of seawater around this time, enabling more effective preservation of meat.

Pollen analysis shows that woodland was decreasing and grassland increasing, with a major decline of elms. The winters were typically 3 degrees colder than at present but the summers some 2.5 degrees warmer.

The Middle Neolithic (c. 3300 BC – c. 2900 BC) saw the development of cursus monuments close to earlier barrows and the growth and abandonment of causewayed enclosures, as well as the building of impressive chamber tombs such as the Maeshowe types. The earliest stone circles and individual burials also appear.

Different pottery types, such as grooved ware, appear during the later Neolithic (c. 2900 BC – c. 2200 BC). In addition, new enclosures called henges were built, along with stone rows and the famous sites of Stonehenge, Avebury and Silbury Hill, which building reached its peak at this time. Industrial flint mining begins, such as that at Cissbury and Grimes Graves, along with evidence of long-distance trade. Wooden tools and bowls were common, and bows were also constructed.

Changes in Neolithic culture could have been due to the mass migrations that occurred in that time. A 2017 study showed that British Neolithic farmers had formerly been genetically similar to contemporary populations in the Iberian peninsula, but from the Beaker culture period onwards, all British individuals had high proportions of Steppe ancestry and were genetically more similar to Beaker-associated people from the Lower Rhine area. The study argues that more than 90% of Britain&#x27;s Neolithic gene pool was replaced with the coming of the Beaker people.

Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of modern European populations shows that over 80% are descended in the female line from European hunter-gatherers. Less than 20% are descended in the female line from Neolithic farmers from Anatolia and from subsequent migrations. The percentage in Britain is smaller at around 11%. Initial studies suggested that this situation is different with the paternal Y-chromosome DNA, varying from 10 to 100% across the country, being higher in the east. This was considered to show a large degree of population replacement during the Anglo-Saxon invasion and a nearly complete masking over of whatever population movement (or lack of it) went before in these two countries. However, more widespread studies have suggested that there was less of a division between Western and Eastern parts of Britain with less Anglo-Saxon migration. Looking from a more Europe-wide standpoint, researchers at Stanford University have found overlapping cultural and genetic evidence that supports the theory that migration was at least partially responsible for the Neolithic Revolution in Northern Europe (including Britain). The science of genetic anthropology is changing very fast and a clear picture across the whole of human occupation of Britain has yet to emerge.

==Bronze Age==
(Around 2200 to 750 BC)
This period can be sub-divided into an earlier phase (2300 to 1200 BC) and a later one (1200 – 700 BC). Beaker pottery appears in England around 2475–2315 &quot;cal.&quot; BC along with flat axes and burial practices of inhumation. With the revised Stonehenge chronology, this is after the Sarsen Circle and trilithons were erected at Stonehenge. Several regions of origin have been postulated for the Beaker culture, notably the Iberian peninsula, the Netherlands and Central Europe. Beaker techniques brought to Britain the skill of refining metal. At first the users made items from copper, but from around 2150 BCE smiths had discovered how to smelt bronze (which is much harder than copper) by mixing copper with a small amount of tin. With this discovery, the Bronze Age arrived in Britain. Over the next thousand years, bronze gradually replaced stone as the main material for tool and weapon making.

Britain had large, easily accessible reserves of tin in the modern areas of Cornwall and Devon and thus tin mining began. By around 1600 BC the southwest of Britain was experiencing a trade boom as British tin was exported across Europe, evidence of ports being found in Southern Devon at Bantham and Mount Batten. Copper was mined at the Great Orme in North Wales.

The Beaker people were also skilled at making ornaments from gold, silver and copper, and examples of these have been found in graves of the wealthy Wessex culture of central southern Britain.

Early Bronze Age Britons buried their dead beneath earth mounds known as barrows, often with a beaker alongside the body. Later in the period, cremation was adopted as a burial practice with cemeteries of urns containing cremated individuals appearing in the archaeological record, with deposition of metal objects such as daggers. People of this period were also largely responsible for building many famous prehistoric sites such as the later phases of Stonehenge along with Seahenge. The Bronze Age people lived in round houses and divided up the landscape. Stone rows are to be seen on, for example, Dartmoor. They ate cattle, sheep, pigs and deer as well as shellfish and birds. They carried out salt manufacture. The wetlands were a source of wildfowl and reeds. There was ritual deposition of offerings in the wetlands and in holes in the ground.

There has been debate amongst archaeologists as to whether the &quot;Beaker people&quot; were a race of people who migrated to Britain &quot;en masse&quot; from the continent, or whether a Beaker cultural &quot;package&quot; of goods and behaviour (which eventually spread across most of Western Europe) diffused to Britain&#x27;s existing inhabitants through trade across tribal boundaries. A 2017 study suggests a major genetic shift in late Neolithic/early Bronze Age Britain, so that more than 90% of Britain&#x27;s Neolithic gene pool was replaced with the coming of a people genetically related to the Beaker people of the lower-Rhine area.

There is evidence of a relatively large scale disruption of cultural patterns (see Late Bronze Age collapse) which some scholars think may indicate an invasion (or at least a migration) into Southern Great Britain c. the 12th century BC. This disruption was felt far beyond Britain, even beyond Europe, as most of the great Near Eastern empires collapsed (or experienced severe difficulties) and the Sea Peoples harried the entire Mediterranean basin around this time. Some scholars consider that the Celtic languages arrived in Britain at this time, but other elements of the Celtic cultural package derive from the Hallstatt culture.

In an archaeogenetics study, Patterson et al. (2021) uncovered a migration into southern Britain during the 500-year period 1,300–800 BC. The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul, and had higher levels of EEF ancestry. During 1,000–875 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain, making up around half the ancestry of subsequent Iron Age people in this area, but not in northern Britain. The &quot;evidence suggests that, rather than a violent invasion or a single migratory event, the genetic structure of the population changed through sustained contacts between Britain and mainland Europe over several centuries, such as the movement of traders, intermarriage, and small scale movements of family groups&quot;. The authors describe this as a &quot;plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain&quot;. There was much less migration into Britain during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then. The study also found that lactose tolerance rose swiftly in early Iron Age Britain, a thousand years before it became widespread in mainland Europe; suggesting milk became a very important foodstuff in Britain at this time.

==Iron Age==
(around 750 BC – 43 AD)
In around 750 BC iron working techniques reached Britain from southern Europe. Iron was stronger and more plentiful than bronze, and its introduction marks the beginning of the Iron Age. Iron working revolutionised many aspects of life, most importantly agriculture. Iron tipped ploughs could turn soil more quickly and deeply than older wooden or bronze ones, and iron axes could clear forest land more efficiently for agriculture. There was a landscape of arable, pasture and managed woodland. There were many enclosed settlements and land ownership was important.

It is generally thought that by 500 BC most people inhabiting the British Isles were speaking Common Brythonic, on the limited evidence of place-names recorded by Pytheas of Massalia and transmitted to us second-hand, largely through Strabo. Certainly by the Roman period there is substantial place and personal name evidence which suggests that this was so; Tacitus also states in his Agricola that the British language differed little from that of the Gauls. Among these people were skilled craftsmen who had begun producing intricately patterned gold jewellery, in addition to tools and weapons of both bronze and iron. It is disputed whether Iron Age Britons were &quot;Celts&quot;, with some academics such as John Collis and Simon James actively opposing the idea of &#x27;Celtic Britain&#x27;, since the term was only applied at this time to a tribe in Gaul. However, place names and tribal names from the later part of the period suggest that a Celtic language was spoken.

The traveller Pytheas, whose own works are lost, was quoted by later classical authors as calling the people &quot;Pretanoi&quot;, which is cognate with &quot;Britanni&quot; and is apparently Celtic in origin. The term &quot;Celtic&quot; continues to be used by linguists to describe the family that includes many of the ancient languages of Western Europe and modern British languages such as Welsh without controversy. The dispute essentially revolves around how the word &quot;Celtic&quot; is defined; it is clear from the archaeological and historical record that Iron Age Britain did have much in common with Iron Age Gaul, but there were also many differences. Many leading academics, such as Barry Cunliffe, still use the term to refer to the pre-Roman inhabitants of Britain for want of a better label.

Iron Age Britons lived in organised tribal groups, ruled by a chieftain. As people became more numerous, wars broke out between opposing tribes. This was traditionally interpreted as the reason for the building of hill forts, although the siting of some earthworks on the sides of hills undermined their defensive value, hence &quot;hill forts&quot; may represent increasing communal areas or even &#x27;elite areas&#x27;. However some hillside constructions may simply have been cow enclosures. Although the first had been built about 1500 BC, hillfort building peaked during the later Iron Age. There are around 3,300 structures that can be classed as hillforts or similar &quot;defended enclosures&quot; within Britain. By about 350 BC many hillforts went out of use and the remaining ones were reinforced. Pytheas was quoted as writing that the Britons were renowned wheat farmers. Large farmsteads produced food in industrial quantities and Roman sources note that Britain exported hunting dogs, animal skins and slaves.

===Late pre-Roman Iron Age (LPRIA)===
The last centuries before the Roman invasion saw an influx of Celtic speaking refugees from Gaul (approximately modern day France and Belgium) known as the Belgae, who were displaced as the Roman Empire expanded around 50 BC. They settled along most of the coastline of southern Britain between about 200 BC and AD 43, although it is hard to estimate what proportion of the population there they formed. A Gaulish tribe known as the Parisi, who had cultural links to the continent, appeared in northeast England.

From around 175 BC, the areas of Kent, Hertfordshire and Essex developed especially advanced pottery-making skills. The tribes of southeast England became partially Romanised and were responsible for creating the first settlements (oppida) large enough to be called towns.

The last centuries before the Roman invasion saw increasing sophistication in British life. About 100 BC, iron bars began to be used as currency, while internal trade and trade with continental Europe flourished, largely due to Britain&#x27;s extensive mineral reserves. Coinage was developed, based on continental types but bearing the names of local chieftains. This was used in southeast England, but not in areas such as Dumnonia in the west.

As the Roman Empire expanded northwards, Rome began to take interest in Britain. This may have been caused by an influx of refugees from Roman occupied Europe, or Britain&#x27;s large mineral reserves. See Roman Britain for the history of this subsequent period.

==Protohistory==
The first significant written record of Britain and its inhabitants was made by the Greek navigator Pytheas, who explored the coastal region of Britain around 325 BC. However, there may be some additional information on Britain in the &quot;Ora Maritima&quot;, a text which is now lost but which is incorporated in the writing of the later author Avienius. Julius Caesar also wrote of Britain in about 50 BC after his two military expeditions to the island in 55 and 54 BC. The failed invasion during 54 BC is thought to be an attempt to conquer at least the southeast of Britain.

After some further false starts, the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD led to most of the island falling under Roman rule, and began the period of Roman Britain.

<text>UPolo, the British University Water Polo League, aims to improve the standard of water polo in UK by giving university teams more opportunity to play at a competitive level. The league, which runs during the academic year and culminates in a Finals tournament, is divided regionally which allows for accessible matches and a full calendar of fixtures in each semester.

<text>A tripeptide (example [[Valine|Val]]-[[Glycine|Gly]]-[[Alanine|Ala]]) with [[Tripeptide|green]] marked [[N-terminus|amino end]] ([[Valine|[[Tripeptide|L-Valine]]]]) and [[Tripeptide|blue]] marked [[C-terminus|carboxyl end]] ([[Alanine|[[Tripeptide|L-Alanine]]]])

A tripeptide is a peptide derived from three amino acids joined by two or sometimes three peptide bonds. As for proteins, the function of peptides is determined by the constituent amino acids and their sequence. In terms of scientific investigations, the dominant tripeptide is glutathione (γ--Glutamyl--cysteinylglycine), which serves many roles in many forms of life.

==Examples==
* Eisenin (pGlu-Gln-Ala-OH) is a peptide with immunological activity that is isolated from the Japanese marine alga, &quot;Eisenia bicyclis&quot;, which more commonly is known as Arame
* GHK-Cu (glycyl--histidyl--lysine) is a human copper binding peptide with wound healing and skin remodeling activity, which is used in anti-aging cosmetics and more commonly referred to as copper peptide
* Lactotripeptides (Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro) found in milk products, act as ACE inhibitors
* Leupeptin (&quot;N&quot;-acetyl--leucyl--leucyl--argininal) is a protease inhibitor that also acts as an inhibitor of calpain
* Melanostatin (prolyl-leucyl-glycinamide) is a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus that inhibits the release of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)
* Ophthalmic acid (-&quot;γ&quot;-glutamyl--&quot;α&quot;-aminobutyryl-glycine) is an analogue of glutathione isolated from crystalline lens
* Norophthalmic acid (&quot;y&quot;-glutamyl-alanyl-glycine) is an analogue of glutathione (-cysteine replaced by -alanine) isolated from crystalline lens
* Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH, thyroliberin or protirelin) (-pyroglutamyl--histidinyl--prolinamide) is a peptide hormone that stimulates the release of thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin by the anterior pituitary
* ACV (δ-(-α-aminoadipyl)--Cys--Val) is a key biosynthetic precursor to penicillin and cephalosporin.

<text>Several unrelated groups of songbirds are called catbirds because of their wailing calls, which resemble a cat&#x27;s meowing. The genus name &quot;Ailuroedus&quot; likewise is from the Greek for &#x27;cat-singer&#x27; or &#x27;cat-voiced&#x27;.

[[Australasia]]n catbirds are the genera &quot;Ailuroedus&quot; and the monotypic &quot;Scenopooetes&quot;. They belong to the bowerbird family (Ptilonorhynchidae) of the basal songbirds:
* Ochre-breasted catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus stonii&quot;)
* White-eared catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus buccoides&quot;)
* Tan-capped catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus geislerorum&quot;)
* Green catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus crassirostris&quot;)
* Spotted catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus melanotis&quot;)
* Huon catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus astigmaticus&quot;)
* Black-eared catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus melanotis&quot;)
* Arfak catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus arfakianus&quot;)
* Northern catbird (&quot;Ailuroedus jobiensis&quot;)

[[New World]] catbirds are two monotypic genera from the mimid family (Mimidae) of the passeridan superfamily Muscicapoidea. Among the Mimidae, they represent independent basal lineages probably closer to the Caribbean thrasher and trembler assemblage than to the mockingbirds and &quot;Toxostoma&quot; thrashers:
* Gray catbird, &quot;Dumetella carolinensis&quot;
* Black catbird, &quot;Melanoptila glabrirostris&quot;

The [[Abyssinian catbird]] (&quot;Sylvia galinieri&quot;) is found in Africa. It was previously considered to represent a monotypic genus &quot;Parophasma&quot;.

<text>Zhao, briefly known officially as Wei (衛) in 350 AD, known in historiography as the Later Zhao (; 319–351) or Shi Zhao (石趙), was a dynasty of China ruled by the Shi family of Jie ethnicity during the Sixteen Kingdoms period. Among the Sixteen Kingdoms, the Later Zhao was the second in territorial size to the Former Qin dynasty that once unified northern China under Fu Jian. In historiography, it is given the prefix of &quot;Later&quot; to distinguish it with the Han-Zhao or Former Zhao, which changed its name from &quot;Han&quot; to &quot;Zhao&quot; just before the Later Zhao was founded.

When the Later Zhao was founded by former Han-Zhao general Shi Le, the capital was at Xiangguo (襄國, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), but in 335 Shi Hu moved the capital to Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei), where it would remain for the rest of the state&#x27;s history (except for Shi Zhi&#x27;s brief attempt to revive the state at Xiangguo). After defeating the Han-Zhao in 329, the Later Zhao ruled a significant portion of northern China and vassalized the Former Liang and Dai; only the Former Yan in Liaoning remained fully out of their control. For roughly twenty years, it maintained a stalemate with the Eastern Jin dynasty in the south before its rapid collapse in 349 following the death of Shi Hu.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Shi Le was a Jie chieftain from Shangdang Commandery in Bing province. The Jie was one of the miscellaneous &quot;hu&quot; (胡; &quot;barbarian&quot;) tribes; these tribes did not fall under the umbrella of the major ethnic groups like the Xiongnu or Xianbei. In 303, when a great famine broke out in Bing that displaced many of the Jie and other &quot;hu&quot; tribes in the region, the provincial inspector, Sima Teng, had these people captured and sold into slavery to fund his army. The Jie and &quot;hu&quot; people were scattered throughout Hebei and Shandong, including Shi Le who was sold to a wealthy family in Shandong but soon attained his freedom. 

By 305, Shi Le had made a name for himself by becoming a bandit, and raised a personal army with his friend, Ji Sang. Taking advantage of growing resentment against the Jin government, the two joined the rebel general Gongshi Fan to avenge the Prince of Chengdu, Sima Ying and later took leadership after Fan’s death, going as far as to sacking the city of Ye in 307. After their defeat, Shi Le led his forces to join the Xiongnu-led Han state in Bing province.

Under Han, Shi Le quickly rose through the ranks, attracting many Jie and &quot;hu&quot; tribes in Hebei to his cause. Like many rebel generals who joined the state, he had full control over his army as the Han court had little actual power to assert their authority. With his peers, he raided the North China Plain, plundering the local counties and commanderies although never capturing them and staying there for long. In 311, he massacred the 100,000 strong Jin imperial army in the Battle of Ningping, allowing Han forces to capture Luoyang in the Disaster of Yongjia.

Shortly after, Shi Le assassinated his rival peer, Wang Mi, and absorbed his army. The Han court, fearing that he would rebel, could only reprimand and appease him. With Wang Mi’s death, Shi Le essentially controlled the eastern parts of the empire, with the exception of Shandong. In 312, Shi Le departed from his practice of leading a roving army to cultivate a base in Xiangguo. He also expanded his territory by defeating the Jin governors, Wang Jun and Liu Kun. In 318, he joined forces with the prince, Liu Yao, in quelling the coup of Jin Zhun, who massacred the emperor and imperial family in Pingyang.

=== Reign of Shi Le ===
During the campaign, Liu Yao was instated as emperor, so Shi Le sent an envoy to congratulate him. However, Liu Yao, believing that Shi Le&#x27;s rebellion was already in motion, had the envoy killed instead. Shi Le promptly declared independence as Liu Yao moved the capital to his base in Chang’an, splitting the empire into two. In 319, Shi Le proclaimed himself the King of Zhao, a title he was supposed to receive before his envoy was killed. Prior to that, Liu Yao had also renamed the state from Han to Zhao. To distinguish the two states, historiographers refer to Liu Yao’s state as Former Zhao and Shi Le’s state as Later Zhao.

In his early reign, Shi Le expanded eastwards while Liu Yao dealt with matters in the west. By 323, he defeated Duan Pidi, one of the last remaining Jin powers in the north and conquered Shandong from the warlord, Cao Ni. War between the two Zhaos only broke out in 324, and in 328, Shi Le and Liu Yao led their armies to face each other in the pivotal Battle of Luoyang. Liu Yao was captured during the battle and later executed, while the remaining Former Zhao forces was destroyed in 329. Thus, the Later Zhao became the hegemonic power in northern China, though some areas were still out of their control; the Former Liang, Dai and Duan-Liaoxi states partially retained their independence through vassalage, while the Xianbei Murong tribe in Liaodong remained loyal to the Eastern Jin dynasty.

To consolidate his rule, Shi Le enacted several policies with the help of Han Chinese ministers such as Zhang Bin. Among others, he re-introduced the Nine Ranks System, promoted agriculture and emphasized education. He also continued the separate governance system between the Han Chinese and non-Chinese people from the Han-Zhao dynasty. He adopted the Grand Chanyu title, tasked with managing the tribes, while also introducing new offices that specifically dealt with litigations and population movements of the tribes. He banned the word “&quot;hu&quot;”, opting to use “&quot;guoren&quot;” (國人; countryman) instead, and forbid the tribes from oppressing the Han Chinese scholar-officials. Various ethnic group from conquered places were relocated to live around his capital, as to better control them and restore agricultural output in the north. Buddhism was also given a platform to grow as the Kuchean monk, Fotu Cheng, held a high-ranking position within Shi Le&#x27;s court.

Shi Le and his family had an unusual practice of adopting people into their clan, the earliest example being Shi Hu, a distant cousin who was adopted by Shi Le&#x27;s father during their tribal years. He continued this practice after taking the throne, and his adopted relatives, especially Shi Hu, became important princes and military commanders. Near the end of his reign, Shi Le prepared his biological son, Shi Hong to take the throne in accordance with the Chinese rule of succession and handpicked a selected few to be his retainers. However, Shi Hu, citing his vast contributions to the state&#x27;s founding, was angered by Shi Le&#x27;s decision as he saw himself having more claim to the throne.

=== Reign of Shi Hu ===
In 333, Shi Le died and was succeeded by Shi Hong. Almost immediately, Shi Hu launched a coup and took over the government, facing very little resistance from most of the Zhao gentry and military. Shi Le&#x27;s family and allies were swiftly eliminated by Shi Hu, and in 334, he took the throne by forcing Shi Hong to abdicate before also having him executed. When he first ascended, Shi Hu took the title of Regnant Heavenly King and later elevated it to Heavenly King in 337. He also moved the capital from Xiangguo to his base in Ye in 335.

Records describe Shi Hu as a tyrant with a violent streak who spent his time indulging in women and alcohol. Most notably, he took on several grand building projects in Ye and greatly expanded his harem at the expense of the common people, who were forced into construction work and often had their women taken away from them. On the other hand, he showed extreme leniency towards his own ministers and military generals, rarely punishing them to maintain their loyalty. The empire remained largely intact throughout his reign, with rebellions being quickly dealt with. Shi Hu reaffirmed Buddhism by continuining to show reverence to Fotu Cheng and promoting religious freedom. He also continued Shi Le&#x27;s policy of relocating people to live around the capital, such as the Di and Qiang people from Guanzhong.

Shi Hu had ambitions to expand the state and heavily conscripted his subjects, but his campaigns yielded very minimal success. In 338, he carried out a joint campaign with the Murong-led Former Yan to conquer the Duan-Liaoxi. After the campaign, he turned on Yan but was defeated in the Battle of Jicheng. In 339, provoked by Eastern Jin movements along the border, he sent his generals to launch an early attack, capturing a few cities before withdrawing. In 346, he invaded the Former Liang but was repelled, although he captured their territory south of the Yellow River.

His reign was also troubled by a succession crisis that would lead to the empire&#x27;s downfall. On two occasions, his crown princes attempted to kill him and usurp the throne, which led to him executing them in brutal fashion. In 349, shortly before his death, Shi Hu chose his 10-year-old son, Shi Shi to be the new Crown Prince and took the title of Emperor. In addition to the displeasure of his other sons, many of the military generals were also not pleased with his decision as he bestowed power to a regent and the soon-to-be empress dowager.

=== Ran Min disturbance and fall ===
After Shi Shi ascended the throne, his half-brother, Shi Zun conspired with the generals to depose him, and among these generals was Shi Hu&#x27;s adopted Han Chinese grandson, Shi Min. Shi Min was a powerful commander and favoured grandson of Shi Hu, who had adopted his father Shi Zhan, originally named Ran Zhan. To convince him into joining the plot, Shi Zun offered Shi Min the position of Crown Prince, which he accepted. Just a month into his reign, Shi Zun&#x27;s forces overthrew Shi Shi, his regent and the empress dowager at Ye. However, after ascending the throne, Shi Zun reneged on his promise and appointed another nephew as the Crown Prince. Shi Zun even planned to assassinate Shi Min, but after the plan leaked, Shi Min led his troops to depose him. He installed Shi Zun&#x27;s half-brother, Shi Jian to the throne, but real power in Ye was held by himself and his ally, Li Nong. In the old capital, Xiangguo, another son of Shi Hu, Shi Zhi, began rallying a coalition to fight Shi Min.

While controlling Shi Jian, Shi Min survived three attempts on his life, which made him deeply wary of his followers. Seeing that the Jie and other tribespeople in Ye refused to submit, he decreed an infamous culling order, calling on his Han Chinese subjects to kill any &quot;hu&quot; person they find. Shi Min personally led his army to massacre the tribes in Ye, while also ordering his generals to purge their armies of tribespeople. The Jie and &quot;hu&quot; were identified by their high noses and full beards, but many of the people killed were also mistakenly-identified Han Chinese. In total, around 200,000 people were killed.

Shi Min killed Shi Jian and declared himself Emperor of Wei in 350, changing his name to Ran Min. In response, Shi Zhi proclaimed himself the new Emperor of Zhao. At this point, the Later Zhao was on the verge of collapse. The Di general, Fu Hong led his forces west to occupy the Guanzhong, where his son Fu Jiàn founded the Former Qin dynasty in 351. The Xianbei general, Duan Kan, also founded his short-lived state of Duan Qi in Shandong. From the northeast, the Former Yan began an invasion to establish themselves on the Central Plains, while the Eastern Jin launched a series of northern expeditions to reclaim lost territory from the south.

For most of his reign, Shi Zhi was besieged at Xiangguo by Ran Min&#x27;s army. He was forced to make an alliance with the Former Yan and demoted his own title to King of Zhao. Despite eventually lifting the siege, he and his family were soon betrayed and slaughtered by his general, Liu Xian in 351. The last member of the Shi clan, Shi Kun fled to the Eastern Jin at Jiankang, where he was put to death.

== Cultural influences ==
Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian were two mechanical engineers under the Later Zhao who built a south-pointing chariot (also called &quot;south-pointing carriage&quot;), a directional compass vehicle that apparently did not use magnetic principle, but was operated by use of differential gears (which apply an equal amount of torque to driving wheels rotating at different speeds), or a similar angular differential principle. For the great ingenuity shown in the construction of the device, Shi Hu granted Xie Fei the noble title of &quot;hou&quot; without land possessions and rewarded him generously.

<text>Closed list describes the variant of party-list systems where voters can effectively vote for only political parties as a whole; thus they have no influence on the party-supplied order in which party candidates are elected. If voters had some influence, that would be called an open list. Closed list systems are still commonly used in party-list proportional representation, and most mixed electoral systems also use closed lists in their party list component. Many countries, however have changed their electoral systems to use open lists to incorporate personalised representation to their proportional systems.

In closed list systems, each political party has pre-decided who will receive the seats allocated to that party in the elections, so that the candidates positioned highest on this list tend to always get a seat in the parliament while the candidates positioned very low on the closed list will not. However, the candidates &quot;at the water mark&quot; of a given party are in the position of either losing or winning their seat depending on the number of votes the party gets. &quot;The water mark&quot; is the number of seats a specific party can be expected to achieve. The number of seats that the party wins, combined with the candidates&#x27; positions on the party&#x27;s list, will then determine whether a particular candidate will get a seat.

<doc id="448504" wikidata="Q223587" url="?curid=448504" title="Mansoura, Egypt">
<text>Mansoura (; &quot;&quot;, , ) is a city in Egypt located on the eastern bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile river. The city is the capital of the Dakahlia Governorate and has a population of 621,953 as of 2021.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Mansoura&quot; in Arabic means &quot;victorious&quot;. The city is named after the El Mansoura Battle (1250) against Louis IX of France during the Seventh Crusade.

==History==
Mansoura was established in 1219 by al-Kamil of the Ayyubid dynasty upon a Phatmetic branch of the Nile on a place of several older villages like Al-Bishtamir () and Kafr al-Badamas (, from , &quot;river, canal&quot;). After the Egyptians defeated the Crusaders during the Seventh Crusade, it was named &quot;Mansoura&quot; (aka. &quot;The Victorious&quot;).

In the Seventh Crusade, the Capetians were defeated and put to flight; between fifteen and thirty thousand of their men fell on the battlefield. Louis IX of France was captured in the main Battle of Fariskur, and confined in the house of Ibrahim Ibn Lokman, secretary of the sultan, and under the guard of the eunuch Sobih. The king&#x27;s brother was imprisoned in the same house. The sultan provided for their sustenance. The house of Ibrahim Ibn Lokman is now the only museum in Mansoura. It is open to the public and houses articles that used to belong to the French monarch, including his personal thirteenth century toilet.

The Mansoura Air Battle on October 14, 1973, occurred during the Yom Kippur War. Israeli Air Force fighters attacking Egyptian air bases were intercepted by the Egyptian Air Force. On that day, 160 jet fighters, most belonging to Israel, battled for 53 minutes over Mansoura. The Egyptian army claimed that despite the numerical and qualitative superiority of the Israeli warplanes, 17 Israeli planes were downed. (2 according to the Israelis), while the rest retreated. Egypt announced the loss of six planes, only three of which fell to Israeli fire. The Egyptian government subsequently changed the country&#x27;s &quot;Air Force Day&quot; from November 2 to October 14, to commemorate the Mansoura Air Battle.

==Geography==

===Location===
Mansoura lies on the east bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile, in the Delta region. Mansoura is about 120 km northeast of Cairo. Across from the city, on the opposite bank of the Nile, is the town of Talkha.

===Climate===
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).

==Culture==
The Egyptian Arabic dialect spoken by Mansoura&#x27;s population is a northern Egyptian Arabic dialect, with noticeable influences from the city&#x27;s surrounding rural villages, each of which has contributed to the city&#x27;s population over the years. There are some similarities to Alexandrian Egyptian Arabic in some aspects of pronunciation.

Mansoura National Museum used to be Dar Ibn Lockman, the house where Louis IX was imprisoned in 1250 during the Seventh Crusade. Displayed in the museum are the suits of mail and swords of the crusaders, as well as a collection of maps. Huge paintings depict the Battle of Mansoura.

The Mansoura branch of the National Library was inaugurated in 2008 as the Mansoura Misr Library.

Mansoura is famous for its architectural style, especially the Shinnawi Palace (after Mohamed Bek El-Shinnawi, a member of the Wafd Party). It was built by an Italian architect in 1928. The mosque of El-Saleh Ayoub El-Kebir is one of the most important in Mansoura. It was built by a loyal servant of the Sultan and is located in Al-Sagha Street that separates &quot;Old Mansoura&quot; from the modern city. 

Like Cairo, Alexandria and Port Said, Mansoura was home to a flourishing Greek community until the Nasser era, when many were forced to leave. Many of the older and best established shops and businesses around the city still bear their original Greek names. Mansoura also had a small Italian population living in the city too. The first Old English school in the city was established on the site of the old Greek school in the Toriel area, one of the traditionally relatively affluent residential districts of the city.

==Education==

The University of Mansoura was founded in 1962, initially as a branch of Cairo University. The Urology and Nephrology center of Mansoura University founded by Prof Mohammed Ghonem is considered to be the best kidney center in the Middle East and Africa.

Mansoura has a sports stadium (Mansoura Stadium) which is home to its football team.
== Clubs (Sport) ==
* Gezert Elward Sport Club: It is located directly on the Nile and has tennis courts, swimming, gymnastics, squash and social club. Recently, the gymnastics team participated under the seven-year club in the Republic Championship and received 2 gold medals 13 silver and 1 bronze and 1 participation.

<text>The Flemish Movement or (Flemish nationalism) (, ) is an umbrella term which encompasses various political groups in the Belgian region of Flanders and, less commonly, in French Flanders. Ideologically, it encompasses groups which have sought to promote Flemish culture and the Dutch language as well as those seeking greater political autonomy for Flanders within Belgium. It also encompasses nationalists who seek the secession of Flanders from Belgium, either through outright independence or (re)unification with the Netherlands.

In the 19th century, the Flemish Movement emerged around a form of cultural patriotism which celebrated Flemish traditions and history and sought equal status for Dutch in the Belgian nation-state, often under the auspices of the Catholic Church. Although gaining many of its initial objectives, it became increasingly radical in the aftermath of World War I. Inspired by authoritarian and fascist politics, it was widely discredited for its association with collaboration in German-occupied Belgium during World War II. However, it re-emerged in the post-war period under the auspices of the Volksunie (1954–2002) and increasingly permeated into other parties in Flanders. The Flemish Movement&#x27;s right wing is dominated by right-wing nationalist organizations such as Vlaams Belang, Voorpost, Nationalistische Studentenvereniging (Nationalist Students Union), and several others. The most radical group on the left side is the socialist and Flemish independentist Flemish-Socialist Movement. The militant wing also still comprises several moderate groups such as the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA, Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie), and several extra-parliamentary organisations, many of which are represented in the Overlegcentrum van Vlaamse Verenigingen (OVV, Consultation Centre of Flemish Associations). The most important of these is the Vlaamse Volksbeweging (VVB, Flemish People&#x27;s Movement).

In recent history, the Flemish Movement has increasingly grown amid the 2007-2011 Belgian political crisis and its aftermath. Since 2010, the separatist N-VA party has been the biggest polled in Flanders, while Vlaams Belang has become the second largest in the 2019 federal and regional elections.

==History==
===Early roots===

In the Spanish and then Austrian Netherlands in the 18th century and until the Brabant Revolution, the language of the literate was Spanish and then gradually French, but accompanied by a vernacular language. Language problems did not arise at that time.

In 1788 Jan Baptist Chrysostomus Verlooy (1747–1797), a jurist and politician from the Southern Netherlands, wrote an essay titled &quot;Verhandeling op d&#x27;Onacht der moederlycke tael in de Nederlanden&quot; (Essay on the disregard of the native language in the Low Countries). It is considered to be the first movement in favour of the Flemish language, but also in favour of freedom and democracy.

Before the creation of the Belgian state, the French language had already been for centuries a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for the bourgeoisie and noble elites among Europe (including the territories that would then become Belgium). With the French Revolution and Napoleon&#x27;s conquests, today&#x27;s Belgium was attached to France in 1795. France imposed its official language on the Belgian territory with the result of accelerating the conversion of the upper class from current Wallonia and Flanders to the French language.

At that time, most of the population however spoke Germanic languages and dialects in the north and south (Flemish, Brabantian, Limburgish and Luxembourgish) as well as Romance languages and dialects in the south of the territory (Walloon, Picard, Champenois and Lorrain) which were not standardized and unified languages. Those people often could not understand or speak any French.

===Belgian Independence===

After the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 led to the creation of a buffer state: the United Kingdom of the Netherlands composed of today&#x27;s Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium.

The United Kingdom of the Netherlands survived for a short period of 15 years; that was put to an end by the Belgian revolution. The revolution was due to a combination of factors, the main one being the difference of religion (Catholic in today&#x27;s Belgium, Protestant in today&#x27;s Netherlands). Other important factors also played a role in the independence. Among those factors, we can cite: 
* The under-representation of Belgians in the parliament (62% of the population for 50% of the seats);
* The over-representation of Dutch people in the administration and important positions (4 times more);
* The fact that the public debt of the Netherlands (higher than the one of the south) had to be supported by the today&#x27;s Belgium as well;
* The diminution in the freedom of the press and freedom of assembly.
* William I of the Netherlands imposed the standard Dutch everywhere in the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium, provoking the anger of the Flemish (albeit close to their language, Flemish people did not master at the time standard Dutch and were not considering this language as theirs ) and of the French-speaking upper-class of today&#x27;s Belgium. On 4 June 1830 (before the revolution) linguistic freedom was however restored.

A common grievance of the Flemish movement is that the Belgian revolution was a will of the French-speaking Belgians. They invoke that the volunteers were mainly Walloons and from the French-speaking bourgeoisie. This argument has also been invoked by Walloon nationalists in the past.

Two studies conducted by prof. John W. Rooney Jr. and prof. Jean Stengers however contradict those statements. These studies have shown that the vast majority of the revolutionaries originated from Brussels and from the province of Brabant and were of modest origin. According to John W. Rooney Jr., between 73% and 88% of the dead and injured were from Brussels and 91% and 95% were from Brabant. Jean Stengers reaches the same conclusion (76% of the fighters from Brussels). Prof. Els Witte comes to the same conclusion regarding the origin of the fighters. At the time, Brussels and the province of Brabant are mainly Brabantian-speaking (close to Flemish), which shows that Flemish speakers actively took part in the Belgian revolution. Rooney concludes that 60% of the workers who took part in the revolution were Flemish speakers. According to the same study, the upper class accounted for only 5% of revolutionaries.

A large part of the Francophone Belgian elites were in fact opposed to the revolution and wanted to remain within the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, considering that their interests would be better served there. This led to a movement called &quot;Orangism&quot; which spread among a substantial part of the French-speaking elites of Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia.

After the Belgian revolution, protests occurred in large Flemish cities, notably in Ghent, where the textile industry was deeply hurt by the new political situation. Those events are however not to be misplaced in time, as they occurred months after the actual revolution.

===French Flanders===
Upon Belgium becoming an independent state from the Netherlands, there was an (administrative) reaction against the Dutch and their language. In an attempt to remove Dutch from the new country, Belgian officials declared that the only official language in Belgium now was French. The Administration, Justice System, and higher education (apart from elementary schools in Flanders) all functioned in the French language. Even Brussels, the capital where more than 95% of the population spoke Dutch, lacked a formal, state-sanctioned Flemish school of higher education. The consequence was that every contact with the government and justice was conducted in French. This led to a number of erroneous legal judgements where innocent people received the death penalty because they were not able to verbally defend themselves at trials.

The French-speaking Belgian government succeeded in removing the Dutch language from all levels of government more quickly in Brussels than in any other part of Flanders. Because the administration was centered in Brussels, more and more French-speaking officials took up residency there. Education in Brussels was only in French which led to a surplus of young, unskilled and uneducated Flemish men. Dutch was hardly taught in the French schools. For example: Dutch was worth 10 points in French schools, but drawing earned 15 points. Today 16% of Brussels is Dutch-speaking, whereas in 1830 it was over 95%.

The French-speaking bourgeoisie showed very little respect for the Flemish portion of the population. Belgium&#x27;s co-founder, Charles Rogier, wrote in 1832 to Jean-Joseph Raikem, the minister of justice:

&quot;Les premiers principes d&#x27;une bonne administration sont basés sur l&#x27;emploi exclusif d&#x27;une langue, et il est évident que la seule langue des Belges doit être le français. Pour arriver à ce résultat, il est nécessaire que toutes les fonctions civiles et militaires soient confiées à des Wallons et à des Luxembourgeois; de cette manière, les Flamands, privés temporairement des avantages attachés à ces emplois, seront contraints d&#x27;apprendre le français, et l&#x27;on détruira ainsi peu à peu l&#x27;élément germanique en Belgique.&quot;

&quot;The first principles of a good administration are based upon the exclusive use of one language, and it is evident that the only language of the Belgians should be French. In order to achieve this result, it is necessary that all civil and military functions are entrusted to Walloons and Luxemburgers; this way, the Flemish, temporarily deprived of the advantages of these offices, will be constrained to learn French, and we will hence destroy bit by bit the Germanic element in Belgium.&quot;

In 1838, another co-founder, senator Alexandre Gendebien, even declared that the Flemish were &quot;one of the more inferior races on the Earth, just like the negroes&quot;.

The economic heart of Belgium in those days was Flanders. However, Wallonia would soon take the lead due to the Industrial Revolution. The Belgian establishment deemed it unnecessary to invest in Flanders and no less than 80% of the Belgian GNP between 1830 and 1918 went to Wallonia. This had as a consequence that Wallonia had a surplus of large coal mines and iron ore facilities, while Flanders, to a large extent, remained a rural, farming region. When Belgium became independent, the economy of Flanders was hard hit. Antwerp was now almost impossible to reach by ships (The Scheldt River was blocked by the Netherlands) and foreign trade was drastically affected. The prosperous textile industry of Ghent lost a major portion of its market to Amsterdam.

===A call for change===
It was decades after the Belgian revolution that Flemish intellectuals such as Jan Frans Willems, Philip Blommaert, Karel Lodewijk Ledeganck, Ferdinand Augustijn Snellaert, August Snieders, Prudens van Duyse, and Hendrik Conscience began to call for recognition of the Dutch language and Flemish culture in Belgium. This movement became known as the Flemish Movement, but was more intellectual than social, with contributors such as the poets Guido Gezelle, , and Albrecht Rodenbach (all of whom were associated with the Minor Seminary, Roeselare).

Cultural organizations promoting the Dutch language and Flemish culture were founded, such as the Willemsfonds in 1851, and the Davidsfonds in 1875. The first &quot;Vlaemsch Verbond&quot; (Constant Leirens, Ghent) and the &quot;Nederduitse Bond&quot;, were founded in 1861. The &quot;Liberale Vlaemsche Bond&quot; was founded in 1867. Writers such as Julius de Geyter and Max Rooses were active in the &quot;Nederduitse Bond&quot;. On 26 September 1866, Julius de Geyter founded the &quot;Vlaamsche Bond&quot; in Antwerp. The Flemish weekly magazine &quot;Het Volksbelang&quot;, founded by Julius Vuylsteke, appeared for the first time on 12 January 1867.

In 1861, the first Flemish political party, the &quot;Meetingpartij&quot; was founded in Antwerp, by radical liberals, Catholics and Flamingants (Jan Theodoor van Rijswijck, J. De Laet and E. Coremans), and it existed until 1914. In 1888, Julius Hoste Sr. founded the moderate liberal Flemish newspaper &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot;, to support the Flemish Movement in Brussels. In 1893, the Flemish priest Adolf Daens, founded the Christene Volkspartij, which would cause a radicalization and democratization of the Catholic party. The first Flemish political success was the passing of the &quot;Gelijkheidswet&quot; (Equality law) in 1898 that for the first time recognized Dutch as equal to French in judicial matters (legal documents).

===World War I===
The liberal politician Louis Franck, the Roman Catholic Frans Van Cauwelaert and the socialist Camille Huysmans (together they were called the &quot;three crowing cocks&quot;) worked together for the introduction of Dutch at Ghent University. In 1911 the proposal by Lodewijk De Raet to this end was accepted, though it would not be implemented until 1930. With the coming of the 20th century the Flemish Movement became more radical and during World War I some activists welcomed the occupiers as &quot;liberating Germanic brothers&quot;. The young Marnix Gijsen and the poet Paul van Ostaijen were involved in this &quot;activist&quot; movement during the war. The Germans did indeed help out their &quot;Germanic brothers&quot; by setting Dutch as the sole administrative language and by creating the Dutch language Von Bissing University in Ghent. Such steps were dictated by the German tactics of taking advantage of the Flemish-Walloon animosity in order to further Germany&#x27;s own aims and to boost the occupying power&#x27;s position known as the &quot;Flamenpolitik&quot;. With German support, Flemish activists formed a regional government, known as the &quot;Raad van Vlaanderen&quot; (RVV) which declared Flemish autonomy in December 1917. During World War I several Flemish soldiers were punished for their active or passive involvement in the Flemish Movement. Ten of these soldiers were sent to a penal military unit in 1918 called the Special Forestry Platoon in Orne, Normandy, France. They were forced to work as woodchoppers in hard living conditions until several months after the war ended. Most of the Flemish population disapproved of those who collaborated with the German occupiers. The language reforms implemented by the Germans during occupation did not remain in place after the defeat of Germany. The collaboration and subsequent prosecution of certain leaders of the Flemish Movement did not produce a climate congenial to compromise.
===Post World War I===

The Flemish Movement became more socially oriented through the &quot;Frontbeweging&quot; (Front Movement), an organization of Flemish soldiers who complained about the lack of consideration for their language in the army, and in Belgium in general, and harbored pacifistic feelings. The Frontbeweging became a political movement, dedicated to peace, tolerance and autonomy (Nooit Meer Oorlog, Godsvrede, Zelfbestuur). A yearly pilgrimage to the IJzertoren is still held to this day. The poet Anton van Wilderode wrote many texts for this occasion.
Many rumours arose regarding the treatment of Flemish soldiers in World War I, though Flemish historians debunked many of these. One such rumour is that many Dutch-speaking soldiers were slaughtered because they could not understand orders given to them in French by French speaking officers. Whether a disproportionate number of Flemish died in the war compared to Walloons remains a point of contention to this day. It is clear, however, that the Belgian army de facto had only French as the official language. The phrase &quot;et pour les Flamands, la meme chose&quot; originated in this environment also, allegedly being used by the French-speaking officers to &quot;translate&quot; their orders into Dutch. It literally means &quot;and for the Flemish, the same thing&quot;, which adds insult to injury for Flemish soldiers not understanding French.
Another source of further frustration was the Belgian royal family&#x27;s poor knowledge of Dutch. King Albert I enjoyed some popularity in the early ages of the war because he was a proponent of the bilingual status of Flanders – even though Wallonia was monolingual French, because he declared his oath to be king in both French and Dutch, and because he gave a speech at the start of the war in Dutch, referring to the Battle of the Golden Spurs. In the last years of the war, however, it became clear that his only wish was to keep his country peaceful, and not to give the Flemish the rights the French-speaking establishment denied them.

In the 1920s the first Flemish nationalist party was elected. In the 1930s the Flemish Movement grew ever larger and Dutch was recognized for the first time as the sole language of Flanders. In 1931, Joris Van Severen founded the &quot;Verbond van Dietse Nationaal-Solidaristen&quot; Verdinaso, a fascist movement in Flanders.

===World War II===
During World War II, Belgium was once again occupied by Germany. The Third Reich enacted laws to protect and encourage the Dutch language in Belgium and, generally, to propagate ill-feelings between Flemings and Francophones, e.g. by setting free only Flemish prisoners-of-war (see Flamenpolitik). The Nazis had no intentions of allowing the creation of an independent Flemish state or of a Greater Netherlands, and instead desired the complete annexation of not only Flanders (which they did &quot;de jure&quot; during the war through the establishment of a &quot;Reichsgau Flandern&quot; in late 1944), but all of the Low Countries as &quot;racially Germanic&quot; components of a Greater Germanic Reich. Most Flemish nationalists embraced collaboration as a means to more autonomy. Because of this collaboration by a few, after the war being part of the Flemish movement was associated with having collaborated with the enemy.

===Post World War II===
While the Vermeylenfonds had been founded in 1945, the Flemish Movement lay dormant for nearly 20 years following the Second World War. In the 1960s the Flemish movement once more gathered momentum and, in 1962, the linguistic borders within Belgium were finally drawn up with Brussels being designated as a bilingual city. Also, in 1967 an official Dutch version of the Belgian Constitution was adopted. For more than 130 years, the Dutch version of the Belgian constitution had been only a translation without legal value.
The late 1960s saw all major Belgian political parties splitting up into either Flemish or Francophone wings. It also saw the emergence of the first major nationalist Flemish party, the Volksunie (&quot;Popular Union&quot;). In 1977 more radical far right-wing factions of the Volksunie became united and, together with earlier far right nationalist groups, formed Vlaams Blok. This party eventually overtook the Volksunie, only to be forced later, on the grounds of a discrimination conviction, to change its name to Vlaams Belang. It has become an important right-wing party of the Flemish Movement.

===Language border===
During the existence of Belgium more and more Dutch-speaking regions have become French-speaking regions; for example, Mouscron (Moeskroen), Comines (Komen), and particularly Brussels (see Francization of Brussels). Every ten years the government counted the people who spoke Dutch and those who spoke French. These countings always favoured the French-speaking part of Belgium. In 1962 the Linguistic Border was drawn. In order to do so, a complicated compromise with the French-speakers was orchestrated: Brussels had to be recognised as an autonomous and bilingual region while Flanders and Wallonia remained monolingual regions. The French-speakers also demanded that in certain regions where there was a minority of more than 30% French-speaking or Dutch-speaking people; there would be &quot;language facilities&quot;. This means that these people can communicate with the government in their birth language.

===Present day===
The Flemish saw these facilities as a measure of integration to another language, as opposed to viewing it as a recognition of a permanent linguistic minority. The French-speaking people, however, saw these language facilities as an acquired right, and a step for an eventual addition to the bilingual region of Brussels, even though that would be unconstitutional. As a result, the number of French-speaking people in these regions (mostly around Brussels) did not decline, and contain a growing majority of French-speaking Belgians, even though they reside in the officially monolingual Flanders. Francization is considered frustrating by the Flemish Movement and a reason for a call to separate.

The situation is intensified due to a lack of Dutch language classes in the French-speaking schools.

===Transfers===
Since the 1960s and continuing into the present time, Flanders is significantly richer than Wallonia. Based on population and GDP figures for 2007, GDP per capita in that year was €28,286 (US$38,186) in Flanders and €20,191 (US$27,258) in Wallonia. Although equalization payments between richer and poorer regions are common in federal states, the amount, the visibility and the utilization of these financial transfers are a singularly important issue for the Flemish Movement. A study by the University of Leuven has estimated the size of the annual transfers from Flanders to Wallonia and Brussels in 2007 at 5.7 billion euros. If the effect of interest payments on the national debt is taken into account the figure could be as high as 11.3 billion euros or more than 6% of Flemish GDP. Flemish criticism is not limited to the size of the transfers but also extends to the lack of transparency and the presumed inability or unwillingness of the recipients to use the money wisely and thus close the economic gap with Flanders. Although no longer relevant in the current economic context, the discussion is often exacerbated by the historic fact that even in the 19th century, when Flanders was much the poorer region, there was a net transfer from Flanders to Wallonia; this was mainly because of relatively heavier taxation of agriculture than of industrial activity.
The tax system was never adjusted to reflect the industrial affluence of Wallonia, which led to an imbalance in tax revenue placing Flanders (average for 1832–1912 period: 44% of the population, 44% of total taxes) at a disadvantage compared with Wallonia (38% of population, 30% of taxes). 

===Current Belgian politics===

As a result of escalating internal conflicts the Volksunie ceased to exist in 2000, splitting into two new parties: Spirit and N-VA (&quot;Nieuwe Vlaamse Alliantie&quot;, New Flemish Alliance). Both parties tried their luck in cartel with a bigger party, N-VA allying with the Christian Democrats of CD&amp;V, and Spirit with the Flemish socialists of SP.a.
The cartel CD&amp;V – N-VA emerged as the clear winner of the Belgian general election in June 2007 on a platform promising a far-reaching reform of the state. However, coalition negotiations with the French-speaking parties, who rejected any reform, proved extremely difficult. When the CD&amp;V leader Yves Leterme was eventually able to form a government, his reform plans had been greatly diluted and with the onset of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008 they were shelved completely. This led N-VA to break up the cartel in September 2008, withdrawing its parliamentary support for the federal government (which was thus left without a parliamentary majority in Flanders, a situation that is not unconstitutional but has been deemed undesirable by politicians and constitutional experts).

The role of Spirit, which represented the more left-leaning part of the former Volksunie, gradually declined. After a series of defections, two unsuccessful attempts to broaden its appeal (each time accompanied by a name change) and ending far below the 5% threshold in the Flemish regional elections of 2009, what was left of the party merged with Groen! (the Flemish green party) at the end of 2009.

In the Belgian general election of June 2010, N-VA became the leading party in Flanders and even in Belgium as a whole, polling 28% of the Flemish vote, dwarfing the senior partner of their former cartel, CD&amp;V, which ended at an all-time low of 17.5%. The enormous growth of N-VA is generally explained as caused by an influx of &quot;moderate&quot; Flemish voters who do not support the party&#x27;s eventual aim of Flemish independence but do want consistent and far-reaching reforms with greater autonomy for the regions, something they no longer trust the traditional parties to be able to achieve. On the Walloon side, the Parti Socialiste (PS), led by Elio Di Rupo, received an even stronger electoral mandate with 37% of the vote. After the election, coalition negotiations started with seven parties: N-VA, CD&amp;V, SP.a and Groen! on the Flemish side, and PS, CDH (nominally Christian Democrat but very much left of centre) and the green party Ecolo on the Francophone side. The talks soon ran into serious difficulties, mainly because of the totally opposed objectives of the two victors: the N-VA economically conservative but with a radical constitutional agenda, the PS socialist and very reluctant to agree to any significant reform of the state. The ensuing deadlock led to an 18-month government formation crisis. In the end, a coalition was formed by CD&amp;V, SP.a, Open VLD on the Flemish side, and PS, CDH and MR on the Walloon side. This coalition however didn&#x27;t contain a majority of the Flemish representatives, with only 43 of 88 Flemish seats supporting it. This situation had never happened since the split of the political parties into Flemish and Walloon wings. The following 2014 election saw large electoral gains for N-VA, mostly at the expense of VB.

== Modern internal trends ==
=== Separatists ===
The militant wing of the Flemish Movement such as the Vlaams Belang advocates the foundation of an independent Flemish republic, separating from Wallonia. A part of this militant wing also advocates reunion with the Netherlands. This view is shared with several Dutch right-winged activists and nationalists, as well as some mainstream politicians both in the Netherlands and Flanders (such as Louis Tobback, the former mayor of Leuven and former minister of defence and Eurocommissioner Frits Bolkestein).

The N-VA takes a gradualist approach looking to transfer powers to Flanders and the EU working towards the final goal of an independent Flanders as a European Member State.

=== Confederalists ===
The liberal List Dedecker, as well as several representatives of important Flemish parties belonging to the moderate wing, including the Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V) party, the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD) party, and, to a lesser extent, the Different Socialist Party (SP.A), prefer a confederal organisation of the Belgian state over the current federal organisation. Such a scheme would make the Flemish government responsible for nearly all aspects of government, whereas some important aspects of government are currently the responsibility of the Belgian federal government. The Belgian capital of Brussels would remain a city where both Dutch-speaking and French-speaking citizens share equal rights.

As of 2010, the confederalist parties make up more than half of the Flemish Parliament, which combined with the separatist parties, would result in about 80% of the Flemish Parliament (and at least this much of the Flemish part of the Belgian Federal Parliament) occupied by parties who wish to see Flanders obtaining greater autonomy than is the case today.

=== Federalists ===
Several representatives of the SP.A and, to a lesser extent, the CD&amp;V and VLD parties, prefer an improved federal organisation of the Belgian state over a confederal one. This view is shared with several social and cultural organisations such as the Vermeylenfonds (Vermeylen Foundation) or Willemsfonds, with labor unions, and with mutual health insurance organisations. The advocates of this view hope to improve the Belgian institutions so that they work correctly.

==Opinion polling==

In June 2006 a poll published by VRT found that 40% percent of respondents support Flemish independence.

In December 2019 a poll published by Le Soir and RTL found that 37% percent of Flemish respondents would vote for Flemish independence, as opposed to only 14% percent of Walloons and 17% percent of Brussels residents.

In May 2021, an article by VRT showed a poll taken by &quot;De Stemming&quot; gauging preferences in how the country is run &quot;(depicted)&quot;. The research ran from late March to 19 April. Correspondents could choose between a grade ranging from 0 to 10, with 0 tending towards &#x27;more Flanders&#x27; and 10 referring to &#x27;more Belgium&#x27;. The study found that 63% wanted &#x27;more Belgium&#x27; and only 27% &#x27;more Flanders&#x27;, with 10% indicating the status quo is fine.

<text>Ismailia ( &quot;&quot;, ) is a city in north-eastern Egypt. Situated on the west bank of the Suez Canal, it is the capital of the Ismailia Governorate. The city had an estimated population of about 1,434,741 according to the statistics issued by the Central Agency for Mobilization and Statistics on 27 July 2022. It is located approximately halfway between Port Said to the north and Suez to the south. The Canal widens at that point to include Lake Timsah, one of the Bitter Lakes linked by the Canal.

== History ==

Ismailia was founded in 1863, during the construction of the Suez Canal, by Khedive Ismail, after whom the city is named. Following the Battle of Kafr-el-Dawwar in 1882 the British established a base there.

The head office of the Suez Canal Authority is located in Ismailia at the shore of Lake Timsah. It has a large number of buildings dating from British and French involvement with the Canal. Most of these buildings are currently used by Canal employees and officials.

During World War I the British had an air base there and the Battle of Romani took place nearby. Ismailia War Cemetery was designed in 1919 by Sir Robert Lorimer marking the casualties of the battle.

In 1973 the Battle of Ismailia took place in the city.

In October 2023, a massive fire broke out in the security directorate of the city, leaving the building fully burned with 38 injured and 1 dead.

===Government and politics===
The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Ismailia by Hassan al-Banna in March 1928. An underground paramilitary wing was established in the 1940s, primarily to contest the British occupation of Egypt. In the early 1950s, Ismailia hosted the British Military HQ and the Civilian Administration Centre of the Canal Zone. An attack on an Egyptian government building and army barracks manned by auxiliary policemen by a British Army force on 25 January 1952 was a key event leading to the overthrow of King Farouk I later that year and the Egyptian Revolution that followed. British forces pulled out of Ismailia in 1954.

== Eparchy ==
On 17 December 1982 an Eparchy (Eastern Catholic Diocese) of Ismayliah was established on territory split off from the Coptic Catholic Patriarchate of Alexandria (Alexandrian Rite in Coptic language), which remains its Metropolitan. Its episcopal see is St. Mark&#x27;s cathedral.

;Suffragan Eparchs (Bishops of Ismayliah)
* Athanasios Abadir (17 December 1982 – 25 December 1992, his death), previously Titular Bishop of Appia and Patriarchal Vicar of Alexandria of the Copts (Egypt) (18 May 1976 – 17 December 1982)
* Youhannes Ezzat Zakaria Badir (23 November 1992 – 23 June 1994), later Eparch (Bishop) of Luqsor of the Copts (Egypt) (23 June 1994 – 27 December 2015, his death)
* Makarios Tewfik (23 June 1994 – 29 June 2019, resigned)

* Pola Ayoub Matta Usama Shafik Akhnoukh (31 March 2023 – Present)

== Education ==
Ismailia has several public and private schools. Ismailia is the home of the Suez Canal University, established in 1976 with the help of the Chinese Government to serve the region of Suez Canal and Sinai. Suez Canal University now is one of the fastest growing educational institutions in Egypt with many students studying abroad.

== Culture and recreation ==

=== Arts and festivals ===

Ismailia hosts two important festivals each year. The first is the International Film Festival for Documentaries and Shorts that is held in June. In June 2014, the 17th consecutive festival was organized. The second is the Ismailia International Folklore Arts Festival that is held in September. In this festival folkloric troupes from all around the globe meet in Ismailia, where they perform folkloric dances representing the culture of their countries.

=== Tourism ===

Ismailia does get tourists from within Egypt, but is not a major tourism destination for international tourists. The city is approximately a ninety-minute automobile drive from Cairo. From Ismailia it is approximately a four-hour drive to Sharm el-Sheikh in South Sinai. Driving to the Taba Border Crossing at Taba and the Rafah Border Crossing at Rafah are both approximately four-hour drives. A major attraction is the Ismailia Museum which was built in 1932. Visitors will find a variety of significant archaeological finds especially from sites in the Ismailia governorate such as Tell el-Maskhuta, from North Sinai, and from Upper Egypt.

=== Sports ===

Ismailia is home to the third most successful club in Egypt (in the field of Football, Ismaily SC. The club&#x27;s performance is considered a major political issue, and can tend to dictate the city&#x27;s mood. The team enjoys brief stints of competition for local and international competition, but its financial situation prevents these stints from extending beyond a few years. The team has won the Egyptian League three times (1967, 1991, 2002), the Egyptian Cup twice (1997, 2000), and the African Cup of Champions Clubs once in 1969 as the first Egyptian and Arab Club team to have won this league.

== Climate ==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).

The hottest recorded temperature was on 14 June 1944 while the coldest recorded temperature was in January.

<doc id="448512" wikidata="Q14211167" url="?curid=448512" title="Top End">
<text>The Top End of Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory is a geographical region encompassing the northernmost section of the Northern Territory, which aside from the Cape York Peninsula is the northernmost part of the Australian continent. It covers a rather vaguely defined area of about behind the northern coast from the Northern Territory capital of Darwin across to Arnhem Land with the Indian Ocean on the west, the Arafura Sea to the north, and the Gulf of Carpentaria to the east, and with the almost waterless semi-arid interior of Australia to the south, beyond the huge Kakadu National Park.

The Top End contains the Territory&#x27;s regional center and its capital city, Darwin, as well as major towns such as Palmerston and Katherine. The well-known town of Alice Springs is located further south, in the arid southern part of the Northern Territory, sometimes referred to by Australians as the Red Centre.

The landscape is relatively flat with river floodplains and grasslands with eucalyptus trees along with rocky areas and patches of rainforest, and in western Arnhem Land a high rugged sandstone plateau cut through with gorges, much of which is in Kakadu National Park. The rivers that form the wetlands include the South and East Alligator Rivers, Mary River, and the Glyde River. The climate is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season, bringing the highest rainfall in northern Australia (over per year). Temperatures do not fluctuate widely throughout the year.

There are a number of islands off the Top End coast including the Tiwi Islands (Bathurst Island and Melville Island), and Groote Eylandt as well as many smaller ones.

==Flora==
Most savanna in Australia is used for grazing livestock, but in this far north, vast areas of grassland are in their original state and dotted with Darwin stringybark and Darwin woollybutt eucalyptus trees; these grasslands are a unique and highly important ecoregion. The sandstone plateau area of the ecoregion is a particularly rich centre of biodiversity supporting a unique heathland flora. The northern Top End is within the Arnhem Land tropical savanna ecoregion. A belt of transitional tropical savannas and woodlands (Carpentaria, Kimberley, and Victoria Plains) lies between the Top End and the semi-arid mulga scrubland, mallee, and sand dunes of Australia&#x27;s centre. The transition is gradual, and the demarcation line that divides the Top End from the centre is arbitrary.

==Fauna==
This area is home to unique wildlife. The rivers and estuaries are home to large populations of both saltwater and freshwater crocodiles, as well as bull sharks, sawfish, and dugongs. The wetlands are a rich habitat vital to bird migration and home to large populations of birds, including the world&#x27;s largest breeding colony of magpie geese, as well as large numbers of rodents and snakes. Endemic species of the Top End include the Woodward&#x27;s wallaroo, Oenpelli python, chestnut-quilled rock-pigeon, Arnhem Land rock rat, and several species of skinks. Other reptiles include frill-necked lizards and large monitor lizards (known locally as goannas). Snakes include the olive python, death adder (&quot;Acanthophis&quot;), mulga, water python (&quot;Liasis fuscus&quot;), and various others. The plateau is home to many of these endemics, especially invertebrates, fish, and frogs, including, for example, hundreds of species of ants. The offshore islands are home to unique subspecies of some of this wildlife.

==Threats and preservation==
The landscape is well preserved and most of the area is traditionally managed by Aboriginal land trusts, including Kakadu National Park, which is Australia&#x27;s largest national park and a World Heritage Site. Although some populations have declined, there have been no major extinctions of wildlife in this area. Darwin, though, is a growing city and a base for agriculture and mining, both of which threaten habitats. Introduced plants and animals, such as the water buffalo, are also changing natural habitats, and there has been criticism of the way the local population has changed the fire regimes used to control the bush foliage, in which large areas are burnt each year and allowed to renew. Also there was a large aboriginal trade in that area which has mostly settled down.

<text>Thomas Duane Arnold (born March 6, 1959) is an American actor and comedian. He is best known for playing Arnie Thomas on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, which starred his ex-wife Roseanne Barr. 

He has appeared in several films, including &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994), &quot;Nine Months&quot; (1995), &quot;Big Bully&quot;, &quot;Carpool&quot;, &quot;The Stupids&quot; (all 1996), &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; (1997), &quot;Animal Factory&quot; (2000), &quot;Cradle 2 the Grave&quot; (2003), &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; (2004), &quot;Happy Endings&quot; (2005), &quot;Pride&quot; (2007), &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; (2008), and &quot;Madea&#x27;s Witness Protection&quot; (2011). He was also the host of &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; for four years, and appeared on &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;.

==Early life==
Arnold was born Thomas Duane Arnold in Ottumwa, Iowa, the son of Linda Kay (née Graham) and Jack Arnold. His mother was Jewish. He had 2 siblings: a sister Lori and a brother Scott. As a child, Arnold was diagnosed with autism. His mother abandoned the family when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised by their father: 

In their teens, Arnold and his sister moved back in with their mother. With her mother&#x27;s consent, Lori was married at age 14 to a man who was 23 years old. Soon Lori was a heavy drug user and dealer running one of the largest meth operations in the Midwest until her arrest in 1989.

Arnold escaped his sister&#x27;s fate, and worked at a meatpacking plant. He attended Ottumwa High School, Indian Hills Community College, and from 1981 to 1983, the University of Iowa, where he studied business administration and writing.

==Career==

In the early 1980s, Arnold had a prop-based comedy routine called &quot;Tom Arnold and the Goldfish Review.&quot; Roseanne Barr brought him in as a writer for her television sitcom, &quot;Roseanne&quot;. He married her in 1990, after she divorced her first husband. Arnold wrote himself into the show as the character &quot;Arnie Thomas&quot; (a play on his name). The couple&#x27;s marriage attracted media and especially tabloid attention due to their sometimes outrageous behavior. In 1992, Arnold starred in his own sitcom, &quot;The Jackie Thomas Show&quot;. Airing after &quot;Roseanne&quot; on ABC, the show lasted 18 episodes.

In 1993, Arnold and Barr bought a house together in the town of Eldon, Iowa and opened a restaurant, &#x27;Roseanne and Tom&#x27;s Big Food Diner&#x27; nearby. The diner served loosemeat sandwiches similar to the specialty of the fictional Lanford Lunch Box on &quot;Roseanne&quot;, which in turn was based on the real-life Canteen Lunch in the Alley in Ottumwa. Both appeared in the 1993 movie &quot;The Woman Who Loved Elvis&quot;, filmed in Ottumwa. In 1994, Arnold appeared as the sidekick to Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s character in James Cameron&#x27;s action blockbuster film &quot;True Lies&quot;. Arnold and Barr divorced in 1994 due to irreconcilable differences. Their restaurant closed in 1995.

After Arnold&#x27;s divorce from Barr, he narrated and starred in several Craftmatic Adjustable Bed commercials that aired throughout 1995. The last commercial that he filmed culminated in Arnold lying in a bed that caught on fire and melted a strand of his underarm hair during the taping; the footage was never released. Arnold commented on Twitter in 2014: &quot;Me and Mike (Michael Jackson) (he was one of my best friends) used to laugh about how [I] had a Pepsi commercial of my own&quot;.

In November 2000, Arnold played the role of Al Raymond in the second-season &quot;Baywatch Hawaii&quot; episode, &quot;The Cage&quot;.

In a late 1990s interview on radio&#x27;s &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, Arnold admitted that his share of his and Barr&#x27;s estate amounted to &quot;over $20,000,000&quot;, including a percentage of the &quot;Roseanne&quot; ABC-TV series, but would not elaborate, citing a confidentiality clause. From 2001 through 2005, he was one of the hosts of &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot;. From 2003 to 2005, Arnold was the voice of Arby&#x27;s &quot;Oven Mitt&quot; commercials.

Arnold had his first romantic leading man part in the 2005 movie &quot;Happy Endings&quot;. That same year, Arnold starred in &quot;The Kid &amp; I&quot;. From 2008 to 2011, he hosted the CMT show &quot;My Big Redneck Wedding&quot;. He hosted CMT&#x27;s &quot;The Biggest Redneck Wedding Ever&quot; in 2008, in which he served as the wedding planner, created a wedding that exceeded the dreams of a couple who wanted to be married in a mud bog, and performed the actual ceremony. CMT also made three series of &quot;My Big Redneck Vacation&quot; presented by Arnold and featuring the Clampet Family from Shreveport, Louisiana.

Arnold&#x27;s role as a child molester in &quot;Gardens of the Night&quot; sparked revelations that he had been a victim of sexual abuse in his childhood. He decided to take on the role to shed more light on the issue.

In January 2017, Tom Arnold was revealed as a celebrity contestant on the Australian edition of &quot;I&#x27;m A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.
He was the first evictee from the jungle, after 17 days, and stated he was paid between $US600,000 and $US700,000 for his participation in the program. In June 2017, Arnold filed a lawsuit against companies Network Ten and &#x27;A List Entertainment&#x27; for defrauding him for being on &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. Arnold claims that he was promised a payment of $425,000 and a comedy tour in Australia. However, he was missing $140,000 in payment and Network Ten backed out of the comedy tour.

In 2018, Arnold&#x27;s Viceland show &quot;The Hunt for the Trump Tapes&quot; premiered to low ratings and mainly negative reviews. The show was canceled after one season.

==Personal life==

Arnold met comedian Roseanne Barr when she saw his act in 1983. Their relationship was complicated by his alcoholism and drug addiction, but eventually he became sober. The two married in 1990 and divorced in 1994. In an April 2009 interview on &quot;Anytime with Bob Kushell&quot;, Arnold discussed why when he divorced Barr, he did not take any alimony. During the next ten years, Arnold married two subsequent times. Both marriages ended in divorce. In August 2008, Arnold broke his scapula in a motorcycle accident on the Pacific Coast Highway.

Over Thanksgiving weekend 2009, Arnold married his fourth wife, Ashley Groussman, in Maui before 75 guests. Dax Shepard served as Arnold&#x27;s best man. He appeared December 10, 2009 on the late night talk show &quot;Asia Uncut&quot;. The couple have two children and four dogs. In January 2019, the couple announced their intention to divorce. The divorce was finalized in July 2020.

Arnold was raised a Methodist. Some sources say he converted to Judaism upon marrying Roseanne Barr in 1990, but in a podcast interview with Andrew Santino he speaks of growing up Jewish in Iowa. Arnold has denied converting to Judaism, which he still practices.

Arnold has given much of his time to charities including giving out toys during the holidays to those in need through the Miracle on 1st Street Toy Giveaway, an annual tradition of his.

===Involvement in Falwell scandal===
In 2019, Arnold tape-recorded a phone call with Michael Cohen where Cohen divulged his involvement in the cover-up of a scandal involving Jerry Falwell Jr., his wife, and a pool boy.

===Family reunion===
On October 8 2020, Tom Arnold, his brother Scottie, and sister Lori reunited for the first time in 28 years, back together again in their hometown of Ottumwa, Iowa. During this time, Lori was filming a 3-part docu-series called &quot;Queen of Meth,&quot; which her brother Tom helped to produce. It recounts her time as the &quot;queen-pin&quot; of a huge drug business that she ran from Iowa to California. &quot;Queen of Meth&quot; was originally released on Discovery+ in May 2021.

<doc id="448518" wikidata="Q1601337" url="?curid=448518" title="Heisenberg group">
<text>In mathematics, the Heisenberg group formula_1, named after Werner Heisenberg, is the group of 3×3 upper triangular matrices of the form
: formula_2
under the operation of matrix multiplication. Elements &quot;a, b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; can be taken from any commutative ring with identity, often taken to be the ring of real numbers (resulting in the &quot;continuous Heisenberg group&quot;) or the ring of integers (resulting in the &quot;discrete Heisenberg group&quot;).

The continuous Heisenberg group arises in the description of one-dimensional quantum mechanical systems, especially in the context of the Stone–von Neumann theorem. More generally, one can consider Heisenberg groups associated to &quot;n&quot;-dimensional systems, and most generally, to any symplectic vector space.

== Three-dimensional case ==
In the three-dimensional case, the product of two Heisenberg matrices is given by
: formula_3
As one can see from the term , the group is non-abelian.

The neutral element of the Heisenberg group is the identity matrix, and inverses are given by
: formula_4

The group is a subgroup of the 2-dimensional affine group Aff(2):
formula_2 acting on formula_6 corresponds to the affine transform formula_7

There are several prominent examples of the three-dimensional case.

=== Continuous Heisenberg group ===
If , are real numbers (in the ring R), then one has the continuous Heisenberg group H3(R).

It is a nilpotent real Lie group of dimension 3.

In addition to the representation as real 3×3 matrices, the continuous Heisenberg group also has several different representations in terms of function spaces. By Stone–von Neumann theorem, there is, up to isomorphism, a unique irreducible unitary representation of H in which its centre acts by a given nontrivial character. This representation has several important realizations, or models. In the &quot;Schrödinger model&quot;, the Heisenberg group acts on the space of square integrable functions. In the theta representation, it acts on the space of holomorphic functions on the upper half-plane; it is so named for its connection with the theta functions.

=== Discrete Heisenberg group ===
If are integers (in the ring Z), then one has the discrete Heisenberg group H3(Z). It is a non-abelian nilpotent group. It has two generators:
: formula_8
and relations
: formula_9
where
: formula_10
is the generator of the center of H3. (Note that the inverses of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; replace the 1 above the diagonal with −1.)

By Bass&#x27;s theorem, it has a polynomial growth rate of order 4.

One can generate any element through
: formula_11

=== Heisenberg group modulo an odd prime &quot;p&quot; ===
If one takes &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; in Z/&quot;p&quot; Z for an odd prime &quot;p&quot;, then one has the Heisenberg group modulo p. It is a group of order &quot;p&quot;3 with generators &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and relations
: formula_12

Analogues of Heisenberg groups over &quot;finite&quot; fields of odd prime order &quot;p&quot; are called extra special groups, or more properly, extra special groups of exponent &quot;p&quot;. More generally, if the derived subgroup of a group &quot;G&quot; is contained in the center &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, then the map &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; × &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; is a skew-symmetric bilinear operator on abelian groups.

However, requiring that &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; to be a finite vector space requires the Frattini subgroup of &quot;G&quot; to be contained in the center, and requiring that &quot;Z&quot; be a one-dimensional vector space over Z/&quot;p&quot; Z requires that &quot;Z&quot; have order &quot;p&quot;, so if &quot;G&quot; is not abelian, then &quot;G&quot; is extra special. If &quot;G&quot; is extra special but does not have exponent &quot;p&quot;, then the general construction below applied to the symplectic vector space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; does not yield a group isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;.

=== Heisenberg group modulo 2 ===
The Heisenberg group modulo 2 is of order 8 and is isomorphic to the dihedral group D4 (the symmetries of a square). Observe that if
: formula_13
then
: formula_14
and
: formula_15

The elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; correspond to reflections (with 45° between them), whereas &quot;xy&quot; and &quot;yx&quot; correspond to rotations by 90°. The other reflections are &quot;xyx&quot; and &quot;yxy&quot;, and rotation by 180° is &quot;xyxy&quot; (= &quot;yxyx&quot;).

== Heisenberg algebra==
The Lie algebra formula_16 of the Heisenberg group formula_1 (over the real numbers) is known as the Heisenberg algebra. 
It may be represented using the space of 3×3 matrices of the form
: formula_18
with formula_19. 

The following three elements form a basis for formula_16:
: formula_21
These basis elements satisfy the commutation relations
: formula_22

The name &quot;Heisenberg group&quot; is motivated by the preceding relations, which have the same form as the canonical commutation relations in quantum mechanics:
: formula_23
where formula_24 is the position operator, formula_25 is the momentum operator, and formula_26 is the Planck constant.

The Heisenberg group has the special property that the exponential map is a one-to-one and onto map from the Lie algebra formula_16 to the group :
: formula_28

=== In conformal field theory ===
In conformal field theory, the term Heisenberg algebra is used to refer to an infinite-dimensional generalization of the above algebra. It is spanned by elements formula_29 with commutation relations
: formula_30
Under a rescaling, this is simply a countably-infinite number of copies of the above algebra.

== Higher dimensions ==
More general Heisenberg groups formula_31 may be defined for higher dimensions in Euclidean space, and more generally on symplectic vector spaces. The simplest general case is the real Heisenberg group of dimension formula_32, for any integer formula_33. As a group of matrices, formula_31 (or formula_35 to indicate that this is the Heisenberg group over the field formula_36 of real numbers) is defined as the group formula_37 matrices with entries in formula_36 and having the form
: formula_39
where
: a is a row vector of length &quot;n&quot;,
: b is a column vector of length &quot;n&quot;,
: &quot;I&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the identity matrix of size &quot;n&quot;.

=== Group structure ===
This is indeed a group, as is shown by the multiplication:
: formula_40
and
: formula_41

=== Lie algebra ===
The Heisenberg group is a simply-connected Lie group whose Lie algebra consists of matrices
: formula_42
where
: a is a row vector of length &quot;n&quot;, 
: b is a column vector of length &quot;n&quot;,
: 0&quot;n&quot; is the zero matrix of size &quot;n&quot;.

By letting e1, ..., e&quot;n&quot; be the canonical basis of R&quot;n&quot; and setting
: formula_43
the associated Lie algebra can be characterized by the canonical commutation relations

where &quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;q&quot;1, ..., &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;, &quot;z&quot; are the algebra generators.

In particular, &quot;z&quot; is a &quot;central&quot; element of the Heisenberg Lie algebra. Note that the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group is nilpotent.

=== Exponential map ===
Let 
: formula_44
which fulfills formula_45. The exponential map evaluates to
: formula_46
The exponential map of any nilpotent Lie algebra is a diffeomorphism between the Lie algebra and the unique associated connected, simply-connected Lie group.

This discussion (aside from statements referring to dimension and Lie group) further applies if we replace R by any commutative ring &quot;A&quot;. The corresponding group is denoted &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;A&quot;).

Under the additional assumption that the prime 2 is invertible in the ring &quot;A&quot;, the exponential map is also defined, since it reduces to a finite sum and has the form above (e.g. &quot;A&quot; could be a ring Z/&quot;p&quot; Z with an odd prime &quot;p&quot; or any field of characteristic 0).

== Representation theory ==
The unitary representation theory of the Heisenberg group is fairly simple later generalized by Mackey theory and was the motivation for its introduction in quantum physics, as discussed below.

For each nonzero real number formula_26, we can define an irreducible unitary representation formula_48 of formula_31 acting on the Hilbert space formula_50 by the formula
: formula_51

This representation is known as the Schrödinger representation. The motivation for this representation is the action of the exponentiated position and momentum operators in quantum mechanics. The parameter formula_52 describes translations in position space, the parameter formula_53 describes translations in momentum space, and the parameter formula_54 gives an overall phase factor. The phase factor is needed to obtain a group of operators, since translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute.

The key result is the Stone–von Neumann theorem, which states that every (strongly continuous) irreducible unitary representation of the Heisenberg group in which the center acts nontrivially is equivalent to formula_48 for some formula_26. Alternatively, that they are all equivalent to the Weyl algebra (or CCR algebra) on a symplectic space of dimension 2&quot;n&quot;.

Since the Heisenberg group is a one-dimensional central extension of formula_57, its irreducible unitary representations can be viewed as irreducible unitary projective representations of formula_57. Conceptually, the representation given above constitutes the quantum-mechanical counterpart to the group of translational symmetries on the classical phase space, formula_57. The fact that the quantum version is only a &quot;projective&quot; representation of formula_57 is suggested already at the classical level. The Hamiltonian generators of translations in phase space are the position and momentum functions. The span of these functions does not form a Lie algebra under the Poisson bracket, however, because formula_61 Rather, the span of the position and momentum functions &quot;and the constants&quot; forms a Lie algebra under the Poisson bracket. This Lie algebra is a one-dimensional central extension of the commutative Lie algebra formula_57, isomorphic to the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group.

== On symplectic vector spaces ==
The general abstraction of a Heisenberg group is constructed from any symplectic vector space. For example, let (&quot;V&quot;, ω) be a finite-dimensional real symplectic vector space (so ω is a nondegenerate skew symmetric bilinear form on &quot;V&quot;). The Heisenberg group H(&quot;V&quot;) on (&quot;V&quot;, &quot;ω&quot;) (or simply &quot;V&quot; for brevity) is the set &quot;V&quot;×R endowed with the group law
: formula_63

The Heisenberg group is a central extension of the additive group &quot;V&quot;. Thus there is an exact sequence
: formula_64

Any symplectic vector space admits a Darboux basis {e&quot;j&quot;, f&quot;k&quot;}1 ≤ &quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; satisfying &quot;ω&quot;(e&quot;j&quot;, f&quot;k&quot;) = &quot;δ&quot;&quot;j&quot;&quot;k&quot; and where 2&quot;n&quot; is the dimension of &quot;V&quot; (the dimension of &quot;V&quot; is necessarily even). In terms of this basis, every vector decomposes as
: formula_65

The &quot;q&quot;&quot;a&quot; and &quot;p&quot;&quot;a&quot; are canonically conjugate coordinates.

If {e&quot;j&quot;, f&quot;k&quot;}1 ≤ &quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; is a Darboux basis for &quot;V&quot;, then let {&quot;E&quot;} be a basis for R, and {e&quot;j&quot;, f&quot;k&quot;, &quot;E&quot;}1 ≤ &quot;j&quot;,&quot;k&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; is the corresponding basis for &quot;V&quot;×R. A vector in H(&quot;V&quot;) is then given by
: formula_66
and the group law becomes
: formula_67

Because the underlying manifold of the Heisenberg group is a linear space, vectors in the Lie algebra can be canonically identified with vectors in the group. The Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group is given by the commutation relation
: formula_68
or written in terms of the Darboux basis
: formula_69
and all other commutators vanish.

It is also possible to define the group law in a different way but which yields a group isomorphic to the group we have just defined. To avoid confusion, we will use &quot;u&quot; instead of &quot;t&quot;, so a vector is given by
: formula_70
and the group law is
: formula_71

An element of the group 
: formula_70 
can then be expressed as a matrix
: formula_73 ,
which gives a faithful matrix representation of H(&quot;V&quot;). The &quot;u&quot; in this formulation is related to &quot;t&quot; in our previous formulation by formula_74, so that the &quot;t&quot; value for the product comes to
: formula_75,
as before.

The isomorphism to the group using upper triangular matrices relies on the decomposition of &quot;V&quot; into a Darboux basis, which amounts to a choice of isomorphism &quot;V&quot; ≅ &quot;U&quot; ⊕ &quot;U&quot;*. Although the new group law yields a group isomorphic to the one given higher up, the group with this law is sometimes referred to as the polarized Heisenberg group as a reminder that this group law relies on a choice of basis (a choice of a Lagrangian subspace of &quot;V&quot; is a polarization).

To any Lie algebra, there is a unique connected, simply connected Lie group &quot;G&quot;. All other connected Lie groups with the same Lie algebra as &quot;G&quot; are of the form &quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot; where &quot;N&quot; is a central discrete group in &quot;G&quot;. In this case, the center of H(&quot;V&quot;) is R and the only discrete subgroups are isomorphic to &quot;Z&quot;. Thus H(&quot;V&quot;)/Z is another Lie group which shares this Lie algebra. Of note about this Lie group is that it admits no faithful finite-dimensional representations; it is not isomorphic to any matrix group. It does however have a well-known family of infinite-dimensional unitary representations.

== Connection with the Weyl algebra ==

The Lie algebra formula_76 of the Heisenberg group was described above, (1), as a Lie algebra of matrices. The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem applies to determine the universal enveloping algebra formula_77. Among other properties, the universal enveloping algebra is an associative algebra into which formula_76 injectively imbeds.

By the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem, it is thus the free vector space generated by the monomials
: formula_79
where the exponents are all non-negative.

Consequently, formula_77 consists of real polynomials 
: formula_81
with the commutation relations
:formula_82

The algebra formula_77 is closely related to the algebra of differential operators on formula_84 with polynomial coefficients, since any such operator has a unique representation in the form
: formula_85

This algebra is called the Weyl algebra. It follows from abstract nonsense that the Weyl algebra &quot;Wn&quot; is a quotient of formula_77. However, this is also easy to see directly from the above representations; viz. by the mapping
: formula_87

== Applications ==

=== Weyl&#x27;s parameterization of quantum mechanics ===

The application that led Hermann Weyl to an explicit realization of the Heisenberg group was the question of why the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture are physically equivalent. Abstractly, the reason is the Stone–von Neumann theorem: there is a unique unitary representation with given action of the central Lie algebra element &quot;z&quot;, up to a unitary equivalence: the nontrivial elements of the algebra are all equivalent to the usual position and momentum operators.

Thus, the Schrödinger picture and Heisenberg picture are equivalent – they are just different ways of realizing this essentially unique representation.

=== Theta representation ===

The same uniqueness result was used by David Mumford for discrete Heisenberg groups, in his theory of equations defining abelian varieties. This is a large generalization of the approach used in Jacobi&#x27;s elliptic functions, which is the case of the modulo 2 Heisenberg group, of order 8. The simplest case is the theta representation of the Heisenberg group, of which the discrete case gives the theta function.

=== Fourier analysis ===
The Heisenberg group also occurs in Fourier analysis, where it is used in some formulations of the Stone–von Neumann theorem. In this case, the Heisenberg group can be understood to act on the space of square integrable functions; the result is a representation of the Heisenberg groups sometimes called the Weyl representation.

== As a sub-Riemannian manifold ==

The three-dimensional Heisenberg group &quot;H&quot;3(R) on the reals can also be understood to be a smooth manifold, and specifically, a simple example of a sub-Riemannian manifold. Given a point &quot;p&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) in R3, define a differential 1-form Θ at this point as
: formula_88

This one-form belongs to the cotangent bundle of R3; that is,
: formula_89
is a map on the tangent bundle. Let
: formula_90

It can be seen that &quot;H&quot; is a subbundle of the tangent bundle TR3. A cometric on &quot;H&quot; is given by projecting vectors to the two-dimensional space spanned by vectors in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; direction. That is, given vectors formula_91 and formula_92 in TR3, the inner product is given by
: formula_93

The resulting structure turns &quot;H&quot; into the manifold of the Heisenberg group. An orthonormal frame on the manifold is given by the Lie vector fields
: formula_94
which obey the relations [&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;] = &quot;Z&quot; and [&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;] = [&quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Z&quot;] = 0. Being Lie vector fields, these form a left-invariant basis for the group action. The geodesics on the manifold are spirals, projecting down to circles in two dimensions. That is, if
: formula_95
is a geodesic curve, then the curve formula_96 is an arc of a circle, and
: formula_97
with the integral limited to the two-dimensional plane. That is, the height of the curve is proportional to the area of the circle subtended by the circular arc, which follows by Green&#x27;s theorem.

== Heisenberg group of a locally compact abelian group ==
It is more generally possible to define the Heisenberg group of a locally compact abelian group &quot;K&quot;, equipped with a Haar measure. Such a group has a Pontrjagin dual formula_98, consisting of all continuous formula_99-valued characters on &quot;K&quot;, which is also a locally compact abelian group if endowed with the compact-open topology. The Heisenberg group associated with the locally compact abelian group &quot;K&quot; is the subgroup of the unitary group of formula_100 generated by translations from &quot;K&quot; and multiplications by elements of formula_98.

In more detail, the Hilbert space formula_100 consists of square-integrable complex-valued functions formula_103 on &quot;K&quot;. The translations in &quot;K&quot; form a unitary representation of &quot;K&quot; as operators on formula_100:
: formula_105
for formula_106. So too do the multiplications by characters:
: formula_107
for formula_108. These operators do not commute, and instead satisfy
: formula_109
multiplication by a fixed unit modulus complex number.

So the Heisenberg group formula_110 associated with &quot;K&quot; is a type of central extension of formula_111, via an exact sequence of groups:
: formula_112

More general Heisenberg groups are described by 2-cocyles in the cohomology group formula_113. The existence of a duality between formula_114 and formula_98 gives rise to a canonical cocycle, but there are generally others.

The Heisenberg group acts irreducibly on formula_100. Indeed, the continuous characters separate points so any unitary operator of formula_100 that commutes with them is an formula_118 multiplier. But commuting with translations implies that the multiplier is constant.

A version of the Stone–von Neumann theorem, proved by George Mackey, holds for the Heisenberg group formula_110. The Fourier transform is the unique intertwiner between the representations of formula_100 and formula_121. See the discussion at Stone–von Neumann theorem#Relation to the Fourier transform for details.

<text>Edward Hankey (born 20 February 1968) is an English former professional darts player and convicted sex offender. Nicknamed &quot;The Count&quot;, he won the BDO World Darts Championship in 2000 and 2009 and was runner-up in 2001.

He moved to the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) in 2012 but suffered a mini-stroke while playing Michael van Gerwen at the 2012 Grand Slam of Darts and took three months away from the sport to recuperate. He lost his PDC tour card in 2014, when he was 94th on the PDC Order of Merit, and returned to the BDO, where he failed to impress in the latter years of his playing career. He made his last appearance at the BDO World Darts Championship in 2016, losing 3–0 in the first round.

Hankey struggled financially in his later career and was declared bankrupt in 2018. In September 2021, he sexually assaulted a girl who was aged over 16 but under 18 at the time. After pleading guilty, he was sentenced in May 2022 to two years in prison and placed on the sex offender registry for ten years.

==Darts career==

===BDO career===

In the 2000 BDO World Darts Championship, after beating Bob Taylor, Steve Douglas, Kevin Painter and Chris Mason, Hankey whitewashed Ronnie Baxter 6–0 in the final, winning the match with a spectacular 170 checkout – the highest three-dart finish achievable. The final lasted only 46 minutes, the shortest in the tournament&#x27;s history. In the semi-final v Chris Mason, he scored a championship record 22 x 180s in a match. (The next highest are 15 and 14, which he also holds, in matches v Tony O&#x27;Shea in the final and Martin Adams in the semi-finals respectively, both in 2009.) He also scored a record 48 x 180s during the 2000 tournament.
Hankey reached the final again in 2001, but lost to John Walton 6–2. After this Hankey went through a fairly barren spell at the Lakeside and did not reach another major final or World Championship semi-final until his victory in the 2009 BDO World Championships.

In 2002, he was knocked out in the second round by Wayne Jones and suffered a first round exit in 2003 to &#x27;Silverback&#x27; Tony O&#x27;Shea. Ranked number two for the 2004 tournament, he was defeated in the quarter-finals, again losing to O&#x27;Shea 5–1. Hankey again reached the quarter-finals in 2005, this time falling to England captain Martin Adams 5–3, despite at one stage in the contest having led by 3–1 in sets. In the 2006 tournament, Hankey had an uncharacteristic &quot;bad day at the office&quot;, crashing out at the first hurdle to Dutchman Albertino Essers.

Seeded eighth for the 2007 BDO World Darts Championship, he defeated Mario Robbe of the Netherlands by 3–0 in the opening round. He then hit another 170 checkout in his tight 4–3 victory over qualifier Davy Richardson, before losing to Adams, again by 5–3. Despite this setback, Hankey remained positive and upbeat about his darts future after the game. He achieved the 9-Darter in the Scottish open 2011.

Hankey won his first round match of the 2008 BDO World Championship over Steve West 3–2. as he defeated Andy Boulton in the second round. He then lost in the quarter-finals to Australian Simon Whitlock 0–5. 

However, controversy continued to follow Hankey during the BDO International Open (formerly the England Open) on 15 June 2008. During a quarter-final match with former PDC player Robbie Green, Hankey went on to lose the match 2–1 in sets in the deciding leg. 

====Second world title and final seasons====
Hankey began the 2009 Lakeside Championships with a first round victory over close friend Brian Woods with a scoreline of 3–0. He then went on to win the Championship, beating his problems with &quot;oche rage&quot; as well as opponents such as former World Champion Walton and England darts team captain Adams, winning the final 7–6 in sets against O&#x27;Shea. Hankey led 4–2 at the interval, but missed several darts to win the match at 6–5, but he finally closed out the match 3–1 in the final set.

===PDC career===
As a result of his world title win, Hankey was invited to the 2009 Grand Slam of Darts, which is organised by the PDC. He accepted the invitation and was drawn in group E with Scott Waites, Wayne Mardle and Simon Whitlock. He lost his opening group game 3–5 to Waites, but went on to win against Wayne Mardle, and was defeated by Simon Whitlock 5–4.

In the 2010 BDO World Darts Championship Hankey beat Gary Robson 3–0 and Willy van de Wiel 4–1 before being knocked out of the competition in the quarter-final by Dave Chisnall with a scoreline of 5–4 on sets, despite at one point leading 4–1.

In the 2010 Grand Slam of Darts he defeated Phil Taylor 5–4 in the group stages, giving him 2 wins out of 2. He then went on to defeat Michael van Gerwen, also 5–4, to proceed to the knockout stage of the competition. Hankey was knocked out of the competition by Steve Beaton in the first knockout stage. He won the Isle of Man open but was unable to follow that up. Although he did get to the semi-finals of the English Open.

Hankey qualified for the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts. He managed to win 2 of his 3 group matches to qualify for the last 16. He played Michael van Gerwen winning the match by 10 legs to 9 before losing narrowly against Mark Walsh 14–16, after making a comeback from a 9–15 deficit.

In the 2012 BDO World Darts Championship, Hankey defeated newcomer Clive Barden 3–2 in sets, then the man who knocked him out of the previous year&#x27;s tournament, Scott Waites 4–3 to qualify for the quarter-final. In the quarter-final, Hankey defeated Martin Atkins 5–1. In the semi-final, Hankey led against débutant and eventual champion Christian Kist 5–3 and had a dart at bullseye to win 6–4, but Kist recovered to win the match 6–5. After the match Hankey announced he did not plan on returning to Lakeside the following year and would instead join the BDO&#x27;s rival organisation, the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC). Hankey also controversially suggested that the air conditioning was deliberately turned on when he was throwing for the match in the tenth set so as to prevent him from leaving the BDO as World Champion.

===Return to PDC===

The day after Hankey&#x27;s announcement that he was leaving the BDO, the PDC announced on its website that it was offering two-year tour cards to the 2012 BDO World Darts Championship semi-finalists. This meant that Hankey automatically received a tour card to play in the PDC and its Pro Tour, rather than having to play through the qualifying school tournament (usually a requirement to all new PDC players). His first event on the tour was the opening Players Championship of 2012, The Spanish Darts Trophy, where he lost 4–6 to Matthew Edgar in the preliminary round. Hankey then won his first matches in the PDC by defeating Steve West 6–5 and Toon Greebe 6–1 in the first UK Open qualifier in Crawley, before losing 6–4 to Connie Finnan. In May, Hankey had his best finish on the tour to date, reaching the last 16 of the Players Championship Event 5, losing 1–6 to Raymond van Barneveld. In his first major event on the tour, the UK Open, Hankey beat qualifier Danny Dutson 4–0 and Andy Jenkins 4–1, but then lost to his old BDO rival Mervyn King 1–4 in the second round.

====Health concerns====

Hankey was drawn in Group B of the 2012 Grand Slam of Darts with Michael van Gerwen, Robert Thornton and Steve Beaton. He was whitewashed 0–5 by Thornton but defeated Beaton 5–3 to stay alive in the group. However, requiring a 5–0 or 5–1 victory over Van Gerwen in his last game to have a chance of progressing, Hankey visibly struggled with a three-dart average of 59, missing five successive shots at a single in the first leg (including two that missed the board completely) to set up a double. Hankey was then seen rubbing his left eye repeatedly and losing his balance, and Van Gerwen eventually won the match 5–0 with a 90 average. Two days later it was revealed that Hankey had suffered a transient ischemic attack, had very high cholesterol and diabetes and needed six to eight weeks&#x27; rest, which ruled him out of the qualifier for the 2013 World Championship.

====Return to the oche====
Hankey returned to competitive darts for the first time in three months in February 2013, in an attempt to qualify for the first European Tour event of the year, the UK Darts Masters. He beat Wayne Atwood in the last 96, before losing 3–6 to Keith Rooney. He produced encouraging displays at the second Players Championship by beating John Henderson 6–3, world number 15 Paul Nicholson 6–5 and world number four James Wade 6–1 to reach the fourth round. Hankey faced Dennis Smith and lost 5–6, missing one dart for the match in the deciding leg to play in his first PDC quarter-final. Hankey qualified for the UK Open and beat Bernd Roith and Dave Weston before seeing a 3–1 lead turn into a 4–9 defeat in the third round to John Part. He qualified for his first European Tour event in July but was forced to withdraw from it in September due to whiplash injuries suffered in a minor car crash. He returned for the Grand Slam of Darts and lost 5–3 in his opening group game to Scott Waites. However, Hankey produced a superb performance in his next game against Dave Chisnall as from 3–3 he hit a 170 finish and then scored 177 in the next leg to set up 32 and a 5–3 win. He then defeated 2013 World Youth champion Michael Smith 5–1 in his final game to progress to the knock-out stages, where he faced Simon Whitlock. Hankey made an amazing fightback from 6–1 down to win 10–9 and reach the quarter-finals of the event for the second time in his career. He played Waites once again and his run came to an end with a 16–10 defeat.

===Return to the BDO===
Hankey&#x27;s two-year tour card expired after the 2014 World Championship and with him being ranked world number 94, well outside the top 64 who retain their professional status, he lost his position in the PDC. He registered to Q School, but withdrew from the event before it began. It was announced soon after that Hankey had decided to end his unsuccessful stay in the PDC and would return to the BDO.
In his first season back in the BDO, his best results were two quarter finals as he narrowly failed to automatically qualify for the Lakeside, being ranked 29 in the BDO (top 28 qualified). He also failed to qualify for the Masters, Lakeside and the World Trophy in the qualifying tournaments held in Hull. In 2015 he qualified for the 2015 BDO World Trophy but was beaten in the first round by Sam Hewson 6–4. 

==Personal life==
Hankey has three children. Following a stroke in 2012, his earnings from tournaments declined and he was declared bankrupt in June 2018. As of May 2022, he and his wife were in the process of divorcing.

=== Conviction for sexual assault ===
In March 2022, Hankey was charged with sexual assault; the prosecution said his female victim was over 16 but under the age of 18. The incident took place in September 2021 and was captured on film. He pleaded guilty to the charge on 14 April 2022 and was released on conditional bail. On 12 May 2022 at Chester Crown Court, he was sentenced to two years in prison and placed on the sex offender registry for ten years.

<text>The Amarillo Gorillas were a minor league hockey team based in Amarillo, Texas. The team was most recently affiliated with the now defunct Central Hockey League (CHL) from 2001–10. The Gorillas began play in 1996 as the Amarillo Rattlers in the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) until the WPHL was bought by the CHL in 2001. They would continue to use the Rattlers name until an ownership change in 2002, composed of local businessmen Bill Tolliver, Gary Thach, Joe Gammesfelter, Daryl Felsberg, Kevin Moon, Jay Hedrick, and Shaughn Ogrady. As the Rattlers, the team frequently finished at the bottom of the WPHL and CHL divisions, but made the playoffs four straight years after becoming the Gorillas until the 2006–2007 season. The Gorillas played in the Amarillo Civic Center. The team&#x27;s most recent head coach was Brian Pellerin.

On May 19, 2010, the Gorillas announced they had ceased operations. However, hockey would remain in Amarillo, as the North American Hockey League, a Junior A league affiliated with USA Hockey, named the Amarillo Bulls started play in the 2010–2011 season.

<doc id="448532" wikidata="Q781099" url="?curid=448532" title="Austin Ice Bats">
<text>The Austin Ice Bats were a professional minor league ice hockey team based in Austin, Texas, from 1996 to 2008. They were originally members of the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL) and later the Central Hockey League (CHL). The team was named for the Mexican free-tailed bats (&quot;Tadarida brasiliensis&quot;) that nest under the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge in the city.

== History ==
The team was established in 1996 and played home games in Luedecke Arena at the Travis County Exposition Center, a multi-purpose building that was furnished with skating ice and dubbed the &quot;Bat Cave&quot; for the games. The team was originally a member of the Western Professional Hockey League (WPHL). The Ice Bats joined several other WPHL teams in a merger with the Central Hockey League (CHL) in 2001. The Ice Bats finished first in their division in both the 2001–02 and 2002–03 season, making it to the championship game and losing to the Memphis RiverKings both times.

On February 15, 2006, the Ice Bats left the Travis County Exposition Center and relocate to Chaparral Ice, near Austin&#x27;s northeast border with neighboring Pflugerville. The Ice Bats cited scheduling conflicts at the Expo Center as the main reason for the move. Chaparral Ice proved to be an unsuccessful venue and seated only 500 fans. For the 2006–07 season, they were affiliated with the Minnesota Wild of the National Hockey League and the Houston Aeros of the American Hockey League. The team was coached by former National Hockey League player Brent Hughes from 1999 to 2003 and again from 2007 to 2008.

In May 2008, the team announced it was leaving Austin due to lack of fan support at Chaparral Ice center, which had a maximum seating capacity of 500. Anticipated competition with the announced Texas Stars of the AHL was also cited as a factor. The team attempted to relocate to Ford Arena in Beaumont, Texas, for the 2008–09 season, but was unsuccessful.

In 2021, a new junior team was launched using the Ice Bats&#x27; name in the North American 3 Hockey League.

== Media ==
Throughout the franchise&#x27;s history, the Ice Bats had three play-by-play announcers: Mark &quot;Space Wrangler&quot; Martello, Glen &quot;Sharky&quot; Norman and Brian &quot;Sun&quot; Rea. Bob &quot;The Blimp&quot; Fonseca was the team&#x27;s first PA announcer. Philip &quot;Dollar&quot; Billnitzer covered the Bats for the Austin-American Statesman during the inaugural season and continued to cover them for CitySearch.com for two more seasons.

<doc id="448533" wikidata="Q17144151" url="?curid=448533" title="Half-breed">
<text>Half-breed is a term, now considered offensive, used to describe anyone who is of mixed race, although in the United States, it usually refers to people who are half Native American and half European/white.

==Use by governments==

===United States===
In the 19th century, the United States government set aside lands in the western states for people of American Indian and European or European American ancestry known as the Half-Breed Tract. The Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation was established by the Treaty of Prairie du Chien of 1830. In Article 4 of the 1823 Treaty of Fond du Lac, land was granted to the &quot;half-breeds&quot; of Chippewa descent on the islands and shore of St. Mary&#x27;s River near Sault Ste. Marie.

Unusually for its time, under the 1850 Donation Land Claim Act, &quot;half-breed Indians&quot; were eligible for land grants in the Oregon Territory, as were married white women.

===Canada===
During the Pemmican War trials that began in 1818 in Montreal regarding the destruction of the Selkirk Settlement on the Red River the terms &quot;Half-Breeds&quot;, &quot;Bois-Brulés&quot;, &quot;Brulés&quot;, and &quot;Métifs&quot; were defined as &quot;Persons descended from Indian women by white men, and in these trials applied chiefly to those employed by the North-West Company&quot;.

The Canadian government used the term half-breed in the late 19th and early 20th century for people who were of mixed Aboriginal and European ancestry. The North-West Half-Breed Commission established by the Canadian government after the North-West Rebellion also used the term to refer to the Métis residents of the North-West Territories. In 1885, children born in the North-West of Métis parents or &quot;pure Indian and white parents&quot; were defined as half-breeds by the commission and were eligible for &quot;Half-breed&quot; Scrip.

In Alberta the Métis formed the &quot;Halfbreed Association of Northern Alberta&quot; in 1932.

==Geographical names==
* Halfbreed Lake National Wildlife Refuge and Halfbreed Lake in Montana

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Half-Breed&quot; is a country and western song recorded by Marvin Rainwater in 1959, which reached #16 on the US Country Chart.
* &quot;Half-Breed&quot; is a song recorded by Cher and released as a single in 1973. On October 6, 1973, it became Cher&#x27;s second US number one hit as a solo artist, and it was her second solo single to hit the top spot in Canada on the same date.
* &quot;Halfbreed&quot; is a memoir written by author Maria Campbell published in 1973. The book details her experience growing up as a Métis woman in Canada.

<doc id="448546" wikidata="Q955750" url="?curid=448546" title="William Powell Frith">
<text>William Powell Frith (9 January 1819 – 2 November 1909) was an English painter specialising in genre subjects and panoramic narrative works of life in the Victorian era. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1853, presenting &quot;The Sleeping Model&quot; as his Diploma work. He has been described as the &quot;greatest British painter of the social scene since Hogarth&quot;.

==Early life==
William Powell Frith was born in Aldfield, near Ripon in the then West Riding of Yorkshire on 9 January 1819. He had originally intended to be an auctioneer. His mother was Jane Frith, née Powell (1779–1851). Frith was encouraged to take up art by his father, a hotelier in Harrogate. Frith was great uncle and an advisor to the English school portrait painter Henry Keyworth Raine (1872–1932).

He moved to London in 1835 where he began his formal art studies at Sass&#x27;s Academy in Charlotte Street, before attending the Royal Academy Schools. Frith started his career as a portrait painter and first exhibited at the British Institution in 1838. In the 1840s he often based works on the literary output of writers such as Charles Dickens, whose portrait he painted (in 1859), and Laurence Sterne.

==Career==

He was a member of The Clique, which also included Richard Dadd. The principal influence on his work was the hugely popular domestic subjects painted by Sir David Wilkie. Wilkie&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Chelsea Pensioners&quot; was a spur to the creation of Frith&#x27;s own most famous compositions. Following the precedent of Wilkie, but also imitating the work of his friend Dickens, Frith created complex multi-figure compositions depicting the full range of the Victorian class system, meeting and interacting in public places. In &#x27;Ramsgate Sands&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Life at the Seaside&#x27;, 1854) he depicted visitors and entertainers at the seaside resort. He followed this with &quot;The Derby Day&quot;, depicting scenes among the crowd at the race at Epsom Downs, which was based on photographic studies by Robert Howlett. This 1858 composition was bought by Jacob Bell for £1,500. It was so popular that it had to be protected by a specially installed rail when shown at the Royal Academy of Arts. Another well-known painting was &quot;The Railway Station&quot;, a scene of Paddington station. In 1863 he was chosen to paint the marriage of the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) and Princess Alexandra of Denmark.

His 1858 painting &quot;The Crossing Sweeper&quot; has been described as breaking &quot;new ground in its description of the collision of wealth and poverty on a London street.&quot;

Later in his career he painted two series of five pictures each, telling moral stories in the manner of William Hogarth. These were the &quot;Road to Ruin&quot; (1878), about the dangers of gambling, and the &quot;Race for Wealth&quot; (1880) about reckless financial speculation. He retired from the Royal Academy in 1890 but continued to exhibit until 1902.

Frith was a traditionalist who made known his aversion to modern-art developments in a couple of autobiographies – &quot;My Autobiography and Reminiscences&quot; (1887) and &quot;Further Reminiscences&quot; (1888) – and other writings. He was also an inveterate enemy of the Pre-Raphaelites and of the Aesthetic Movement, which he satirised in his painting &quot;A Private View at the Royal Academy&quot; (1883; Private collection), in which Oscar Wilde is depicted discoursing on art while Frith&#x27;s friends look on disapprovingly. Fellow traditionalist Frederic Leighton is featured in the painting, which also portrays painter John Everett Millais and novelist Anthony Trollope.

In his later years, he painted many copies of his famous paintings, as well as more sexually uninhibited works, such as the nude &quot;After the Bath&quot;. A well-known raconteur, his writings, most notably his chatty autobiography, were very popular.

In 1856, Frith was photographed at &quot;The Photographed Institute&quot; by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of &quot;fine artists&quot;. The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857.

Frith died in 1909 aged 90 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

===Exhibitions and legacy===
The first major retrospective in Frith&#x27;s native Britain for half a century was staged at the Guildhall Art Gallery, London in November 2006. It transferred to Mercer Art Gallery in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in March 2007. Frith&#x27;s study for his last major work, &quot;The Private View&quot;, 1881, is in the Mercer Art Gallery. His work was also shown at the Whitechapel Gallery in London during an exhibition running from 25 October – 1 December 1951. Frith has paintings in the collection of several British institutions including Derby Art Gallery, Sheffield, Harrogate and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

==Personal life==
Frith was married twice. He had twelve children with his first wife, Isabelle, whilst a mile down the road maintaining a mistress (Mary Alford, formerly his ward) and seven more children – all a marked contrast to the upright family scenes depicted in paintings like &quot;Many Happy Returns of the Day&quot;. Frith married Alford a year after the death of Isabelle in 1880. A daughter from his first family, Jane Ellen Panton, published &quot;Leaves of a life&quot; in 1908. It is a book of childhood reminiscences describing her father and the family&#x27;s set of artist and literary friendships, chiefly members of The Clique. Walter Frith, the third son from Frith&#x27;s first marriage, was the author of fourteen plays and three novels.

<text>HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; (pennant D21) was a of the Royal Navy. She was the fourth Group 2 and the last of the County-class built.

The fifth ship named Norfolk, she was laid down on 15 March 1966 by Swan Hunter and launched by Lavinia, Duchess of Norfolk on 16 November 1967. She was commissioned on 7 March 1970.

In 1982 she was sold to Chile and served in their navy as Capitán Prat until 2006 and subsequently sold for scrap.

==Design==

&quot;Norfolk&quot; is described as a destroyer, rather than a cruiser, because the Royal Navy and First Sea Lord Earl Mountbatten had seen guided missile destroyers as easier to gain approval from the Treasury than cruisers, when the class originated in the late 1950s. By the late 1960s the armament being fitted to &quot;Norfolk&quot; was dated and limited with no more than the guns of a mid-1950s destroyer and a supposedly improved Sea Slug missile which was untested at the time work on &quot;Norfolk&quot; started. By the mid-1960s the Minister of Defence Denis Healey and the Labour Government were reducing the size of the Royal Navy and rejecting the idea of broken back conventional or limited nuclear war in the Atlantic. The Labour defence doctrine was one of tighter nuclear deterrence with the main armament, tactical nuclear and anti-submarine emphasis. Norfolk did not really fit with this strategy and was built to keep shipyards open and as a low level cruiser for low level defence, diplomacy, third world bushfire wars and recruitment. Eventually such ships could be sold to the third world to aid British interests in South America, the Middle East and Asia where Britain was withdrawing its own forces.

==Royal Navy service==
&quot;Norfolk&quot; was first commissioned on 7 March 1970 and was present at Portsmouth Navy Days. In 1972 &quot;Norfolk&quot; began a refit to replace &#x27;B&#x27; turret with four Exocet launchers. She was thus the first Royal Navy warship to be armed with the Exocet missile system. She also became the first warship to carry three independent missile systems: Exocet, Sea Cat and Sea Slug. &quot;Norfolk&quot; recommissioned in 1974. She had a displacement of 6,200 tons and was quite a large ship, considering she was classified as a destroyer. She undertook numerous deployments to the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and South Pacific Ocean. By the mid-1970s it was clear that the Mk 2 Sea Slug did not represent a significant improvement over the earlier version, because it was even less reliable and attempts to develop successful sustainer motors had failed. There was only money to fit new computer command and control to the three other second group County class, so Norfolk was reduced to increasingly marginal and third line roles.

In September 1976, one of the highlights of her relatively peaceful career came, when she flew the Queen&#x27;s Colour in Sweden and King Carl XVI Gustaf unveiled a plaque to commemorate the British Admiral James de Saumarez. During the ship&#x27;s visit to Fremantle, Australia in 1979, she had an unwelcome milestone - she became the first warship afloat to hold a Court Martial in over 10 years. The visit itself was made to commemorate 150 years of the founding of Western Australia.

In September 1976, &quot;Norfolk&quot; took over the UK&#x27;s commitment to Standing Naval Force Atlantic. She decommissioned in 1981 to become the Dartmouth Training Ship at Britannia Royal Naval College. Now of marginal naval value in the North Atlantic with even the Exocets being a light short ranged missile compared with the Soviets, &quot;Norfolk&quot; was inevitably a candidate for early pay off to be sold to third world or Commonwealth countries. She was first offered to New Zealand about the start of 1981. Its main selling point was seaworthiness, good range and current datalinks giving interoperability with both the RN and USN.

==Chilean Navy service==

&quot;Norfolk&quot; was sold to Chile on 6 April 1982 and renamed &quot;Capitán Prat&quot;, after Arturo Prat, commander of the Chilean ship during the War of the Pacific. In 1996, her Sea Cat launchers were removed and she was fitted with the Barak SAM. In 2001, her Sea Slug system was removed and she was refitted as a Helicopter Destroyer with a Cougar attack helicopter.

On 24 February 2006, &quot;Capitán Prat&quot; was laid up; she was decommissioned on 11 August 2006. In September 2008, she sailed to Mexico for scrap.

==Commanding officers==
Notable commanding officers include JWD Cook (1971-1972), Anthony J Whetstone (1977-1978) and A D Hutton (1978-1980).

<doc id="448554" wikidata="Q311811" url="?curid=448554" title="Shoshenq I">
<text>Hedjkheperre Setepenre Shoshenq I (Egyptian &quot;ššnq&quot;; reigned )—also known as Shashank or Sheshonk or Sheshonq I—was a pharaoh of ancient Egypt and the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt.

==Family==
Of Meshwesh ancestry, Shoshenq I was the son of Nimlot A, Great Chief of the Ma, and his wife Tentshepeh A, a daughter of a Great Chief of the Ma herself; Shoshenq was thus the nephew of Osorkon the Elder, a Meshwesh king of the 21st Dynasty.

He is generally presumed to be the Shishak mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, and his exploits are carved on the Bubastite Portal at Karnak.

==Chronology==

The conventional dates for his reign, as established by Kenneth Kitchen, are 945–924 BC but his time-line has recently been revised upwards by a few years to 943–922 BC, since he may well have lived for up to two to three years after his successful campaign in Israel and Judah, conventionally dated to 925 BC. As Edward Wente of the University of Chicago noted (1976) on page 276 of his JNES 35 Book Review of Kitchen&#x27;s study of the Third Intermediate Period, there is &quot;no certainty&quot; that Shoshenq&#x27;s 925 BC campaign terminated just prior to this king&#x27;s death a year later in 924 BC. Egyptologist Morris Bierbrier also dated Shoshenq I&#x27;s accession &quot;between 945–940 BC&quot; in his 1975 book concerning the genealogies of Egyptian officials, who served during the late New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period. Bierbrier based his opinion on Biblical evidence collated by W. Albright in a BASOR 130 paper. This development would also account for the mostly unfinished state of decorations of Shoshenq&#x27;s building projects at the Great Temple of Karnak where only scenes of the king&#x27;s Palestinian military campaign are fully carved. Building materials would first have had to be extracted and architectural planning performed for his great monumental projects here. Such activities usually took up to a year to complete before work was even begun. This would imply that Shoshenq I likely lived for a period in excess of one year after his 925 BC campaign. On the other hand, if the Karnak inscription was concurrent with Shoshenq&#x27;s campaign into Canaan, the fact that it was left unfinished would suggest this campaign occurred in the last year of Shoshenq&#x27;s reign. This possibility would also permit his 945 BC accession date to be slightly lowered to 943 BC.

A 2005 study by Rolf Krauss of ancient Egyptian chronology suggests that Shoshenq I came to power in 943 BC rather than 945 BC as is conventionally assumed based on epigraphic evidence from the Great Dakhla stela, which dates to Year 5 of his reign. Krauss and David Warburton write in the 2006 book &quot;Ancient Egyptian Chronology&quot;:

The chronology of early Dyn. 22 depends on dead reckoning. The sum of the highest attested regnal dates for Osorkon II, Takelot I, Osorkon I, and Shoshenq I, added to 841 BC as year 1 of Shoshenq III, yields 938 BC at the latest for year 1 of Shoshenq I...[However] The large Dakhla stela provides a lunar date in the form of a &quot;wrš&quot; feast in year 5 of Shoshenq [I], yielding 943 BC as his year 1.

The Year 5 &quot;wrš&quot; feast is recorded to have been celebrated at Dakhla oasis on IV Peret day 25 and Krauss&#x27; exploration of the astronomical data leads him to conclude that the only &#x27;fit&#x27; within the period of 950 to 930 BC places the accession of Shoshenq I between December 944 and November 943 BC—or 943 BC for the most part. However, Dr. Anthony Leahy has suggested that &quot;the identification of the &quot;wrš&quot;-festival of Seth as [a] lunar [festival] is hypothetical, and [thus] its occurrence on the first day of a lunar month an assumption. Neither has been proven incontrovertibly.&quot; Thus far, however, only Dr. Kenneth Kitchen is on record as sharing the same academic view.

A 2010 study by Thomas Schneider argued that Shoshenq reigned from 962 to 941 BCE. Ido Koch in his 2021 book considered Schneider&#x27;s chronology of Egyptian kings as a valuable integrative study. However, recent archaeomagnetic dating at Beth-Shean, one of three early sites that could have been destroyed by Shoshenq I, shows 68.2% probability the destruction occurred between 935 and 900 BC, and 95.4% probability it occurred between 940 and 879 BC.

==Biblical Shishak==

Shoshenq I is conventionally identified with the Egyptian king Shishak (שׁישׁק &quot;Šîšaq&quot;, transliterated), referred to in the Hebrew Bible at 1 Kings 11:40, 14:25 and 2 Chronicles 12:2–9. According to these passages, Jeroboam fled from Solomon and stayed with Shishaq until Solomon died, and Shishaq invaded Judah, mostly the area of Benjamin, during the fifth year of the reign of Rehoboam, taking with him most of the treasures of the temple built by Solomon. The egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen proposes that Shoshenq&#x27;s successor, Osorkon I, lavished 383 tons of gold and silver on Egyptian temples during the first four years of his reign and correlate it directly to the looting, while the archaeologist Israel Finkelstein claims that the looting narrative in question &quot;should probably be seen as a theological construct rather than as historical references&quot;.

Shishak/Sousakim was also related to Jeroboam: &quot;the wife of Jeroboam&quot; is a character in the Hebrew Bible. She is unnamed in the Masoretic Text, but according to the Septuagint, she was an Egyptian princess called Ano:
:And Sousakim gave to Jeroboam Ano the eldest sister of Thekemina his wife, to him as wife; she was great among the king&#x27;s daughters...

Archaeologists at Tel Gezer recently concluded that correlation of Stratum 7, (927–885 BC, 68.3% hpd), &quot;with Shishak/Sheshonq I&#x27;s [e]nd boundary, [included in] the biblical date for Shishak’s campaign [d]oes not fit well with [their] current 14C-based estimates for Sheshonq I,&quot; which they considered to be (c. 969-940 BC with 68.3% hpd, and 991-930 BC with 95.4% hpd) in Stratum 8.

==Origins and family==

Shoshenq I was the son of Nimlot A and Tentsepeh A. His paternal grandparents were the Chief of the Ma Shoshenq A and his wife Mehytenweskhet A. Prior to his reign, Shoshenq I had been the Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Army, and chief advisor to his predecessor Psusennes II, as well as the father-in-law of Psusennes&#x27; daughter &quot;Maatkare&quot;. He also held his father&#x27;s title of Great Chief of the Ma or Meshwesh, which is an Egyptian word for Ancient Libyans. His ancestors had settled in Egypt during the late New Kingdom, probably at Herakleopolis Magna, though Manetho claims Shoshenq himself came from Bubastis, a claim for which no supporting physical evidence has yet been discovered. Significantly, his uncle Osorkon the Elder had already served on the throne for at least six years in the preceding 21st Dynasty; hence, Shoshenq I&#x27;s rise to power was not wholly unexpected. As king, Shoshenq chose his eldest son, Osorkon I, as his successor and consolidated his authority over Egypt through marriage alliances and appointments. He assigned his second son, Iuput A, the prominent position of High Priest of Amun at Thebes as well as the title of Governor of Upper Egypt and Commander of the Army to consolidate his authority over the Thebaid. Finally, Shoshenq I designated his third son, Nimlot B, as the &quot;Leader of the Army&quot; at Herakleopolis in Middle Egypt.

==Foreign policy==

He pursued an aggressive foreign policy in the adjacent territories of the Middle East, towards the end of his reign. This is attested, in part, by the discovery of a statue base bearing his name from the Lebanese city of Byblos, part of a monumental stela from Megiddo bearing his name, and a list of cities in the region comprising Syria, Philistia, Phoenicia, the Negev, and the Kingdom of Israel, among various topographical lists inscribed on the walls of temples of Amun at al-Hibah and Karnak. The fragment of a stela bearing his cartouche from Megiddo has been interpreted as a monument Shoshenq erected there to commemorate his victory. Some of these conquered cities include ancient Israelite fortresses such as Megiddo, Taanach and Shechem.

There are other problems with Shoshenq being the same as the biblical Shishak: Shoshenq&#x27;s Karnak list does not include Jerusalem—his biggest prize according to the Bible. His list focuses on places either north or south of Judah, as if he did not raid the center. The fundamental problem facing historians is establishing the aims of the two accounts and linking up the information in them.

There have been some possible suggestions and proposals from scholars regarding this issue. Some argue that the mention of Jerusalem was erased from the list over time. Others believe that Rehoboam&#x27;s tribute to Shoshenq saved the city from destruction and therefore from the Bubastite Portal&#x27;s lists. Some scholars even propose that Shoshenq claimed a conquest that he did not enact and copied the list of conquered territories from an old Pharaoh&#x27;s conquest list.

As an addendum to his foreign policy, Shoshenq I carved a report of campaigns in Nubia and Israel, with a detailed list of conquests in Israel. This is the first military action outside Egypt formally commemorated for several centuries. This report of conquests is the only surviving late Iron Age text concerning Canaan.

==Domestic policy==
Libyan concepts of rule allowed for the parallel existence of leaders who were related by marriage and blood. Shoshenq and his immediate successors used that practice to consolidate their grasp on all of Egypt. Shoshenq terminated the hereditary succession of the high priesthood of Amun. Instead he and his successors appointed men to the position, most often their own sons, a practice that lasted for a century.

==Burial==

Shoshenq I was succeeded by his son Osorkon I after a reign of 21 years. According to the British Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, no trace has yet been found of the tomb of Shoshenq I. The sole funerary object linked to Shoshenq I is a canopic chest of unknown provenance that was donated to the Egyptian Museum of Berlin (ÄMB 11000) by Julius Isaac in 1891. This may indicate his tomb was looted in antiquity, but this hypothesis is unproven. Egyptologists differ over the location of Shoshenq I&#x27;s burial and speculate that he may have been buried somewhere in Tanis—perhaps in one of the anonymous royal tombs here—or in Bubastis. However, Troy Sagrillo in a GM 205 (2005) paper observes that &quot;there are only a bare handful of inscribed blocks from Tanis that might name the king (i.e. Shoshenq I) and none of these come from an &quot;in situ&quot; building complex contemporary with his reign.&quot; Hence, it is more probable that Shoshenq was buried in another city in the Egyptian Delta. Sagrillo offers a specific location for Shoshenq&#x27;s burial—the Ptah temple enclosure of Memphis—and notes that this king built:
Sagrillo concludes by observing that if Shoshenq I&#x27;s burial place was located at Memphis, &quot;it would go far in explaining why this king&#x27;s funerary cult lasted for some time at the site after his death.&quot;

While Shoshenq&#x27;s tomb is currently unknown, the burial of one of his prominent state officials at Thebes, the Third Prophet of Amun Djedptahiufankh, was discovered intact in tomb DB320 in the 19th century. Inscriptions on Djedptahiufankh&#x27;s Mummy bandages show that he died in or after Year 11 of this king. His mummy was discovered to contain various gold bracelets, amulets and precious carnelian objects, and give a small hint of the vast treasures that would have adorned Shoshenq I&#x27;s tomb.

<doc id="448557" wikidata="Q1146739" url="?curid=448557" title="Tokyo subway sarin attack">
<text>The was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated on 20 March 1995, in Tokyo, Japan, by members of the cult movement Aum Shinrikyo. In five coordinated attacks, the perpetrators released sarin on three lines of the Tokyo Metro (then &quot;Teito Rapid Transit Authority&quot;) during rush hour, killing 13 people, severely injuring 50 (some of whom later died), and causing temporary vision problems for nearly 1,000 others. The attack was directed against trains passing through Kasumigaseki and Nagatachō, where the National Diet (Japanese parliament) is headquartered in Tokyo.

The group, led by Shoko Asahara, had already carried out several assassinations and terrorist attacks using sarin, including the Matsumoto sarin attack nine months earlier. They had also produced several other nerve agents, including VX, attempted to produce botulinum toxin and had perpetrated several failed acts of bioterrorism. Asahara had been made aware of a police raid scheduled for 22 March and had planned the Tokyo subway attack in order to hinder police investigations into the cult and perhaps spark the apocalypse the leader of the group had prophesied.

In the raid following the attack, police arrested many senior members of the cult. Police activity continued throughout the summer, and over 200 members were arrested, including Asahara. Thirteen of the senior Aum management, including Asahara himself, were sentenced to death and later executed; many others were given prison sentences up to life. The attack remains the deadliest terrorist incident in Japan as defined by modern standards.

== Background ==
=== Aum Shinrikyo ===
==== Origins ====

Aum Shinrikyo was founded in 1984 as a yoga and meditation class, initially known as , by pharmacist Chizuo Matsumoto. The group believed in a doctrine revolving around a syncretic mixture of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Christian and Hindu beliefs, especially relating to the Hindu god Shiva. They believed Armageddon to be inevitable in the form of a global war involving the United States and Japan; that non-members were doomed to eternal hell, but could be saved if killed by cult members; and that only members of the cult would survive the apocalypse, and would afterwards build the Kingdom of Shambhala. In 1987, the group rebranded and established a New York branch; the following year, it opened a headquarters in Fujinomiya. Around this time, the mental health of Matsumoto (now going by the name Shoko Asahara) deteriorated – he developed a health anxiety and expressed suicidal views.

In August 1989, the group was granted official religious corporation status by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, giving it privileges such as tax breaks and freedom from governmental oversight. This recognition caused dramatic growth, including an increase in net worth from less than 430 million yen to over 100 billion yen (approximately $7m to $1.3b in 2024 dollars) over the next six years, as well as an increase in membership from around 20 members to around 20,000 by 1992.

The drastically increasing popularity of the group also saw an increase in violent behavior from its members. In the year preceding its recognition by the Tokyo government, a member of the cult – Terayuki Majima – had accidentally drowned during a ritual; his body was cremated, with the remaining bones ground up and scattered over a nearby lake. Majima&#x27;s friend – a fellow member of the group – was murdered by members acting under Asahara&#x27;s orders, after he became disillusioned and tried to leave.

Three months after recognition, six Aum Shinrikyo members were involved in the murder of Tsutsumi Sakamoto and his family. Sakamoto had been working on a class-action lawsuit against the cult. Asahara had previously advanced the concept of &quot;&#x27;poa&quot;&#x27;: a doctrine which stated that not only were people with bad karma doomed to an eternity in hell (unless they were &#x27;rebirthed&#x27; through intervention by &#x27;enlightened people&#x27;), but that it was acceptable to kill those at risk of bad karma to save them from hell.

==== Early attempts to seize power ====
Asahara had experienced delusions of grandeur as early as 1985. In his meditation sessions during this time, he claimed that the god Shiva had been revealed to him, and had appointed him &#x27;Abiraketsu no Mikoto&#x27; (&#x27;The god of light who leads the armies of the gods&#x27;), who was to build the Kingdom of Shambhala, a utopian society made up of those who had developed &#x27;psychic powers&#x27;.

In 1990, Asahara announced that the group would run 25 candidates in the election that year to the Japanese Diet, under the banner of . Despite showing confidence in their ability to gain seats in the diet, the party received only 1,783 votes; the failure to achieve power legitimately, blamed by Asahara on an external conspiracy propagated by &quot;Freemasons and Jews&quot;, caused him to order the cult to produce botulinum and phosgene in order to overthrow the Japanese government. As members became disillusioned with the group (following contact with the outside world made during the election campaign) and defected, an attitude among the remaining members that &#x27;the unenlightened&#x27; did not deserve salvation became accepted.

Attempts to stockpile botulinum toxin proved unsuccessful. Seiichi Endo – one of the members tasked with acquiring botulinum toxin – collected soil samples from the Ishikari River, and attempted to produce the toxin using three capacity fermenters. In total, around 50 batches of of a crude broth were producedhowever, the cult did not attempt to purify the broth (which mostly would have consisted of bacterial cultivation media; one member even fell into one of the fermenters and nearly drowned, but otherwise suffered no ill effects).

Despite mouse bioassays run by Tomomasu Nakagawa (another cult member assisting Endo) returning no toxic effects, in April 1990 the crude broth was loaded into three trucks equipped with custom spray devices, which was to be sprayed at two US naval bases, Narita airport, the Diet building, the Imperial Palace, and the headquarters of a rival religious group.

Simultaneously, Asahara announced that the coming apocalyptic war could not save people outside of the cult, and that members should attend a three-day seminar in Ishigakijima in order to seek shelter. The spraying attacks failed to cause any ill effects among the population but 1,270 people attended the seminar, many of them becoming devout monks.

With the intention of building a compound incorporating facilities such as a phosgene plant (as well as facilities to manufacture VX and chlorine gas), Aum Shinrikyo used 14 dummy companies to purchase acres of land in Namino (now part of Aso city), and began construction. However, public attitudes towards the cult had become very negative due to suspicions around the cult&#x27;s illegal activities. These attitudes were exacerbated once it was revealed to the surrounding community that the group had acted illegally. A police investigation in October resulted in the arrests of several Aum members, causing Asahara to fear a police raid – he hence ordered the destruction of all biological and chemical weapon stockpiles, and for the cult to focus on legitimate, non-violent strategies only.

==== Restarting violent activity ====
After the destruction of the illegal weapon stockpiles, the cult relied on &#x27;mainstream&#x27; methods to attract other members – this included frequent television appearances by Asahara, as well as the setting up of the &#x27;Aum Shinrikyo broadcasting&#x27; radio station in Russia in April 1992. However, starting in late 1992, Asahara&#x27;s mental health deteriorated further – he began to complain of hallucinations and paranoia, and he withdrew from public appearances (except on Aum Shinrikyo Broadcasting), claiming society was preventing him from fulfilling his destiny as Christ. The concurrent replacement of the previously predominantly female group of top advisers with a more aggressive male group led to the gradual restarting of the violent campaign to seize power. At some point in 1992, Asahara published &quot;Declaring Myself the Christ&quot;, in which he identified with the &quot;Lamb of God&quot;.

He outlined a doomsday prophecy, which included a Third World War, and described a final conflict culminating in a nuclear Armageddon, borrowing the term from the Book of Revelation . His purported mission was to take upon himself the sins of the world, and he claimed he could transfer to his followers spiritual power and take away their sins.

Asahara claimed to be able to see dark conspiracies everywhere promulgated by Jews, Freemasons, the Dutch, the British Royal Family, and rival Japanese religions.

The president of the Okamura ironworks, an industrial plant facing debt troubles, was a member of the cult who consulted with Asahara about a takeover strategy. In September 1992, Asahara was made president of the ironworks, resulting in 90% of staff being dismissed or leaving due to the &#x27;Aum-ification&#x27; of the plant. These workers were replaced with other members of the group. Over the course of 1993, the cult smuggled AK-74 rifles and 5.45x39mm bullets, and began to prototype rifles based on the AK-74 design.

Under the oversight of Endo, the biological weapons division of the cult resumedthis time pursuing not only botulinum toxin, but also anthrax, using improved drum fermenters at their Kameido facility.

Again, the group did not attempt to purify the resulting product, which resembled a foul-smelling brown slurry. Further failed attacks on individuals were attempted in 1993 and 1994 using botulinum – first using a homemade sprayer mounted to a car, and then by mixing with juice – but neither had any effects. Five days before the sarin attack on the Tokyo subways, botulinum was dispersed in a failed attack on Kasumigaseki station – a dissident member had replaced the active compound with water, but the cult had failed to acquire an active strain of &quot;C. botulinum&quot;.

Similarly, the Aum anthrax program was a failure – despite having access to a sympathiser outside of the group who could acquire anthrax spores, the strain received by the group was a Sterne vaccine strain incapable of causing harm. It was unclear why, despite having this knowledge, the group executed two attacks in 1993 using this vaccine strain – once from the roof of the headquarters building in Kameido, and once from a truck with a custom spraying device, aimed at the Diet building, Imperial Palace, and Tokyo Tower. Both attacks caused no effects other than a foul smell, reported by passers-by.

In the summer of 1993, Endo attempted a different strategy – by desiccating the slurry, the &quot;B. anthracis&quot; spores could be spread as a powder, rather than through spraying – this was achieved with a crude hot air dryer. Nakagawa has claimed that an attempt was made to spread this powder through the centre of Tokyo, but this, also, had no effects. The total failure of the biological weapons program had, by mid-1993, convinced Asahara to focus on the chemical weapons division under Masami Tsuchiya. While Endo would be promoted within the cult to &#x27;health minister&#x27; in 1994 – reflecting his seniority – no further attacks using biological weapons were attempted.

=== Chemical weapon production ===

Tsuchiya had established a small laboratory in their Kamikuishiki complex in November 1992. After initial research (done at Tsukuba University, where he had previously studied chemistry), he suggested to Hideo Muraia senior Aum advisor who had tasked him with researching chemical weapons in November 1992, out of fear that the cult would soon be attacked with themthat the most cost-effective substance to synthesize would be sarin.

He was subsequently ordered to produce a small amountwithin a month, the necessary equipment had been ordered and installed, and of sarin had been produced via synthetic procedures derived from the five-step DHMP process as originally described by IG Farben in 1938, and as used by the Allies after World War II.

After this small quantity had been produced, Murai ordered Tsuchiya to produce about when Tsuchiya protested, noting that this level of scaling was not feasible in a research laboratory, a chemical plant was ordered to be built alongside the biological production facility in the Fujigamine district of Kamikuishiki, to be labeled Satyan-7 (&#x27;Truth&#x27;). The specialized equipment and substantial chemicals needed to run the facility were purchased using shell companies under Hasegawa Chemical, a chemical company already owned by Aum. At the same time, in September 1993, Asahara and 24 other cult members traveled from Tokyo to Perth, Australia, bringing generators, tools, protective equipment (including gas masks and respirators), and chemicals to make sarin.

After repurchasing chemicals confiscated by customs, the group chartered aircraft from Perth to Banjawarn Station, where they searched for uranium deposits to make nuclear weapons and may have tested the efficacy of the synthesized sarin on animals. They remained in Australia for eight days and attempted to return in October of the same year, but were denied visasBanjawarn Station was sold by Aum in October 1994 for ~AU$150,000 less than market rate, the buyers noted that the previous owners wanted the property sold as soon as possible. They left behind several drums of hazardous and toxic chemicals and empty bottles of sake strewn about the property. Being concerned, the new owners contacted the Australian Federal Police, who soon inspected the property due to concerns about its previous owners, and Banjawarn was exposed as a former chemical weapons testing site for Aum. 

The Satyan-7 facility was declared ready for occupancy by September 1993 with the capacity to produce about of sarin, being equipped with capacity mixing flasks within protective hoods, and eventually employing 100 Aum members; the UN would later estimate the value of the building and its contents at $30 million.

Despite the safety features and often state-of-the-art equipment and practices, the operation of the facility was very unsafe – one analyst would later describe the cult as having a &quot;high degree of book learning, but virtually nothing in the way of technical skill.&quot;

When the facility developed leaks, buckets were used to contain spills; several technicians inhaled fumes on repeated occasions, developing &#x27;symptoms ranging from nosebleeds to convulsions&#x27;, and toxic chemicals leaked from the site and into the soil. Citizens lodged complaints about foul smells several times, with the cult claiming that the US Army had assaulted the complex with poison gas. An accident at the plant in November 1994 would eventually force the suspension of the production of chemical agents.

By December, Tsuchiya had accumulated in total about of sarinfrom this, two separate assassination attempts were made on Daisaku Ikeda, leader of Soka Gakkai (a rival Japanese religious movement), in mid-1994. The first attack involved a truck with a spraying system, as previously used – the spraying system malfunctioned, spraying sarin into the truck itself, and mildly poisoning the operators. The second attack utilized a truck modified to include an evaporation system based on heating sarin over a gas stove fire; despite prior warnings from cult member Kazuyoshi Takizawa, the truck caught fire during the dissemination, severely poisoning the driver Tomomitsu Niimi and causing both Niimi and Murai – the operators – to flee. Niimi received an injection of atropine and pralidoxime iodine, saving his life.

Despite the failure of the attack, the members of Aum were convinced of sarin&#x27;s efficacy, prompting Asahara to appoint Takizawa in charge of operations of Satyan-7; Tsuchiya was assigned to several other projects and would go on to manufacture several psychoactives – LSD, PCP, methamphetamine, mescaline, and phenobarbital to be used in the cult activities and brainwashing; he would also manufacture small amounts of phosgene, VX, soman, cyclosarin, and gunpowder. These compounds would be used in several attacks and assassination attempts:

=== Matsumoto sarin attack ===

In June 1994, Asahara ordered the cult to assassinate the judges involved in deciding a commercial land dispute involving the cult, due to his belief that they would not deliver a favourable judgement. About a week later, on 27 June, of sarin was loaded onto a truck equipped with a fan, heater, and pumpsix members, pre-administered with sarin antidotes and wearing improvised gas masks, began the propagation of sarin at around 10:40pm, spraying for around 10–20 minutes.

Due to it being a warm evening, many residents had left their windows open while they sleptthe first emergency call was made at 11:09pm. Within an hour, a mass disaster caused by an unknown toxic gas had been declared. Fifty-eight people were hospitalised, of whom seven people died in the immediate aftermath, and an eighth 14 years later, and an additional 253 people sought medical care at outpatient clinics.

Investigations after the Matsumoto attack were generally inconclusive, with the primary suspect being Yoshiyuki Kōno, whose wife had been left comatose by the attack. Blame would not be clearly attributed to Aum Shinrikyo until after the subway attack, despite tipoffs – in September 1994, two anonymous letters were sent to major media outlets in Japan – the first asserting that the group were responsible for the attack, and the second claiming that Matsumoto was an open-air &#x27;experiment of sorts&#x27;, noting that the results would have been much worse if sarin had been released indoors, such as in &#x27;a crowded subway&#x27;.

Following an accident at Satyan-7 the next month (and complaints from the surrounding communities), a police investigation revealed methylphosphonic acid and isopropyl methylphosphonic acid – the former being a degradation product of sarin, and the latter being a definitive signature of both sarin production and of failures in production. However, there was no law at the time prohibiting the production of the nerve agents. This evidence was left unacted on, but was leaked to the Yomiuri Shimbun in January 1995, alerting Asahara and the cult, and causing Nakagawa and Endo to begin the process of destroying and/or hiding all nerve agents and biological weapons, which lasted until the end of February.

=== Preparation for the attack ===
Fingerprint evidence for an Aum member linked to an earlier kidnapping, in addition to the sarin-contaminated soil samples, caused the police to set a raid date for 22 March. Asahara was made aware of the impending raid by two cult members inside the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and ordered an attack on Tokyo subway lines close to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department on the morning of 20 March – possibly as a desperate attack to initiate the apocalypse.

To aid in this, Tsuchiya was ordered by Endo to produce sarin again on 18 March – due to a lack of normal precursors as a result of the chemical destruction process, the sarin produced was of a lower quality and caused the normally colourless sarin to appear brown. of the chemical was manufactured and stored in a large container, from which it was decanted into plastic bags. Later forensic analysis found that the sarin utilised in the attack was roughly half as pure as that used in the Matsumoto attack.

== Attack ==
On Monday, 20 March 1995, five members of Aum Shinrikyo launched a chemical attack on the Tokyo subway (on lines that are part of the present-day Tokyo Metro), one of the world&#x27;s busiest commuter transport systems, at the peak of the morning rush hour. The chemical agent used, liquid sarin, was contained in plastic bags which each team then wrapped in newspaper. Each perpetrator carried two packets totaling approximately of sarin, except Yasuo Hayashi, who carried three bags totalling approximately of sarin. Aum originally planned to spread the sarin as an aerosol but did not follow through with it. Sarin has an LD50 of , corresponding to for a human; however, dispersal issues dramatically reduced its effectiveness.

Carrying their packets of sarin and umbrellas with sharpened tips, the perpetrators boarded their appointed trains. At prearranged stations, the sarin packets were dropped and punctured several times with the sharpened tip of the umbrella. Each perpetrator then got off the train and exited the station to meet his accomplice with a car. Leaving the punctured packets on the floor allowed the sarin to leak out into the train car and stations. This sarin affected passengers, subway workers, and those who came into contact with them. Sarin is the most volatile of the nerve agents, which means that it can quickly and easily evaporate from a liquid into a vapor and spread into the environment. People can be exposed to the vapor even if they do not come in contact with the liquid form of sarin. Because it evaporates so quickly, sarin presents an immediate but short-lived threat.

=== Chiyoda Line ===

The team of Ikuo Hayashi and Tomomitsu Niimi were assigned to drop and puncture two sarin packets on the Chiyoda Line. Hayashi was the perpetrator and Niimi was his getaway driver. On the way to Sendagi Station, Niimi purchased newspapers to wrap the sarin packets in—the Japan Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;Akahata&quot; and the Sōka Gakkai&#x27;s &quot;Seikyo Shimbun&quot;.

Hayashi eventually chose to use &quot;Akahata&quot;. Wearing a surgical mask commonly worn by the Japanese during cold and flu season, Hayashi boarded the first car of southwest-bound 07:48 Chiyoda Line train number A725K (JR East 203 series set 67) which was running on a through service from the Joban Line. As the train approached Shin-Ochanomizu Station, the central business district in Chiyoda, he punctured one of his two bags of sarin, leaving the other untouched, and exited the train at Shin-Ochanomizu.

The train proceeded down the line with the punctured bag of sarin leaking until 4 stops later at Kasumigaseki Station. There, the bags were removed and eventually disposed of by station attendants, of whom two died. The train continued on to the next station where it was completely stopped, evacuated and cleaned.

=== Marunouchi Line ===

==== Ogikubo-bound ====

Two men, Ken&#x27;ichi Hirose and Koichi Kitamura, were assigned to release two sarin packets on the westbound Marunouchi Line destined for Ogikubo Station. The pair left Aum headquarters in Shibuya at 6:00 am and drove to Yotsuya Station. There Hirose boarded a westbound Marunouchi Line train, then changed to a northbound JR East Saikyō Line train at Shinjuku Station and got off at Ikebukuro Station. He then bought a sports tabloid to wrap the sarin packets in and boarded the second car of Marunouchi Line train A777 (02 series set 16).

As he was about to release the sarin, Hirose believed the loud noises, on the usually quiet train, caused by the newspaper-wrapped packets had caught the attention of a schoolgirl. To avoid further suspicion, he got off the train at either Myogadani or Korakuen Station and moved to the third car instead of the second.

As the train approached Ochanomizu Station, Hirose dropped the newspapers to the floor, repeated an Aum mantra and punctured both sarin packets with so much force that he bent the tip of his sharpened umbrella. Both packets were successfully broken, and all of sarin was released onto the floor of the train. Hirose then departed the train at Ochanomizu and left via Kitamura&#x27;s car waiting outside the station. Hirose&#x27;s clumsy release of the sarin resulted in him accidentally poisoning himself, but he was able to administer an antidote stored in Kitamura&#x27;s car.

At Nakano-sakaue Station, 19 stops later, two severely injured passengers were carried out of the train car, while station attendant Sumio Nishimura removed the sarin packets (one of these two passengers was the only fatality from this attack). The train continued with sarin still on the floor of the third car. Five stops later, at 08:38, the train reached Ogikubo Station, the end of the Marunouchi Line, all while passengers continued to board the train. The train continued eastbound until it was finally taken out of service at Shin-Kōenji Station two stops later. The entire ordeal resulted in one passenger&#x27;s death with 358 being seriously injured.

==== Ikebukuro-bound ====

Masato Yokoyama and his driver Kiyotaka Tonozaki were assigned to release sarin on the Ikebukuro-bound Marunouchi Line. On the way to Shinjuku Station, Tonozaki stopped to allow Yokoyama to buy a copy of &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot;, to wrap the two sarin packets. When they arrived at the station, Yokoyama put on a wig and fake glasses and boarded the fifth car of the Ikebukuro-bound 07:39 Marunouchi Line train number B801 (02 series set 50). As the train approached Yotsuya Station, Yokoyama began poking at the sarin packets. When the train reached the next station, he fled the scene with Tonozaki, leaving the sarin packets on the train car. The packets were not fully punctured. During his drop, Yokoyama left one packet fully intact, while the other packet was only punctured once (and with a small hole), resulting in the sarin being released relatively slowly.

The train reached the end of the line, Ikebukuro, at 08:30 where it would head back in the opposite direction. Before it departed the train was evacuated and searched, but the searchers failed to discover the sarin packets. The train departed Ikebukuro Station at 08:32 as the Shinjuku-bound A801. Passengers soon became ill and alerted station attendants of the sarin-soaked newspapers at Kōrakuen Station. One station later, at Hongō-sanchōme, staff removed the sarin packets and mopped the floor, but the train continued on to Shinjuku. After arriving at 09:09, the train once again began to make its way back to Ikebukuro as the B901. The train was finally put out of service at Kokkai-gijidō-mae Station in Chiyoda at 09:27, one hour and forty minutes after Yokoyama punctured the sarin packet. The attack resulted in no fatalities, but over 200 people were left in serious condition.

=== Hibiya Line ===

==== Tōbu Dōbutsu Kōen-bound ====

Toru Toyoda and his driver Katsuya Takahashi were assigned to release sarin on the northeast-bound Hibiya Line.

The pair, with Takahashi driving, left Aum headquarters in Shibuya at 06:30. After purchasing a copy of &quot;Hochi Shimbun&quot; and wrapping his two sarin packets, Toyoda arrived at Naka-Meguro Station where he boarded the first car of northeast-bound 07:59 Hibiya Line train number B711T (Tobu 20000 series set 11). Sitting close to the door, he set the sarin packets on the floor. When the train arrived at the next station, Ebisu, Toyoda punctured both packets and got off the train. He was on the train for a total of two minutes, by far the quickest sarin drop out of the five attacks that day.

Two stops later, at Roppongi Station, passengers in the train&#x27;s first car began to feel the effects of the sarin and began to open the windows. By Kamiyacho Station, the next stop, the passengers in the car had begun panicking. The first car was evacuated and several passengers were immediately taken to a hospital. Still, with the first car empty, the train continued down the line for one more stop until it was completely evacuated at Kasumigaseki Station. This attack killed one person and seriously injured 532 others.

==== Naka-Meguro-bound ====

Yasuo Hayashi and Shigeo Sugimoto were the team assigned to drop sarin on the southwest-bound Hibiya Line departing Kita-Senju Station for Naka-Meguro Station. Unlike the rest of the attackers, Hayashi carried three sarin packets onto the train instead of two. Prior to the attack, Hayashi asked to carry a flawed leftover packet in addition to the two others in an apparent bid to allay suspicions and prove his loyalty to the group.

After Sugimoto escorted him to Ueno Station, Hayashi boarded the third car of southwest-bound 07:43 Hibiya Line train number A720S (03 series set 10) and dropped his sarin packets to the floor. Two stops later, at Akihabara Station, he punctured two of the three packets, left the train, and arrived back at Aum headquarters with Sugimoto by 08:30. Hayashi made the most punctures of any of the perpetrators. By the next stop, passengers in the third car began to feel the effects of the sarin. Noticing the large, liquid-soaked package on the floor and assuming it was the culprit, one passenger kicked the sarin packets out of the train and onto Kodenmachō Station&#x27;s subway platform. Four people in the station died as a result.

A puddle of sarin remained on the floor of the passenger car as the train continued to the next station. At 08:10, after the train pulled out of Hatchōbori Station, a passenger in the third car pressed the emergency stop button. The train was in a tunnel at the time, and was forced to proceed to Tsukiji Station, where passengers stumbled out and collapsed on the station&#x27;s platform and the train was taken out of service.

The attack was originally believed to be an explosion and was thus labeled as such in media reports. Eventually, station attendants realized that the attack was not an explosion, but rather a chemical attack. At 08:35, the Hibiya Line was completely shut down and all commuters were evacuated. Between the five stations affected in this attack, 8 people died and 275 were seriously injured.

== Main perpetrators ==
Ten members of Aum Shinrikyo were responsible for carrying out the attacks: five released the sarin, while the other five served as getaway drivers.

The five duos were:
Naoko Kikuchi, an eleventh member of Aum, was involved with producing the sarin.

=== Train A725K (Chiyoda Line train) ===
==== Ikuo Hayashi ====
Ikuo Hayashi (born 23 January 1947) was 48 years old at the time of the attacks. Prior to joining Aum, Hayashi was a senior medical doctor with &quot;an active &#x27;front-line&#x27; track record&quot; at the Ministry of Science and Technology. The son of a doctor, Hayashi graduated from Keio University. He was a heart and artery specialist at Keio Hospital, which he left to become head of Circulatory Medicine at the National Sanatorium Hospital in Tokai, Ibaraki (north of Tokyo).

In 1990, Hayashi resigned his job and left his family to join Aum in the monastic order Sangha, where he became one of Asahara&#x27;s favorites and was appointed the group&#x27;s Minister of Healing, as which he was responsible for administering a variety of &quot;treatments&quot; to Aum members, including sodium pentothal and electric shocks to those whose loyalty was suspect. These treatments resulted in several deaths.

Hayashi later reported to the Japanese police investigators about the sarin attacks and Aum activities post-Tokyo subway attack; his cooperation with the authorities resulted in numerous arrests and convictions, and he was given a life sentence instead of death penalty.

==== Tomomitsu Niimi ====
Tomomitsu Niimi, who was Hayashi&#x27;s getaway driver, was 31 years old at the time of the attacks; he was sentenced to death due to his involvement in other crimes perpetrated by Aum members. Niimi was executed at the Osaka Detention House on 6 July 2018 with six others of those principally involved.

=== Train A777 (Ogikubo-bound Marunouchi Line train) ===
==== Kenichi Hirose ====
Kenichi Hirose (12 June 1964 – 26 July 2018) was 30 years old at the time of the attacks. Holder of a postgraduate degree in physics from Waseda University, Hirose became an important member of the group&#x27;s Chemical Brigade in their Ministry of Science and Technology. He was also involved in the group&#x27;s Automatic Light Weapon Development scheme.

After releasing the sarin, Hirose showed symptoms of sarin poisoning. He was able to inject himself with the antidote (atropine sulphate) and was rushed to the Aum-affiliated Shinrikyo Hospital in Nakano for treatment. Medical personnel at the hospital had not been given prior notice of the attack and were consequently clueless regarding what treatment Hirose needed. When Kitamura realized that he had driven Hirose to the hospital in vain, he instead drove to Aum&#x27;s headquarters in Shibuya where Ikuo Hayashi gave Hirose first aid.

Hirose was later sentenced to death for his role in the attack. His appeal against his death sentence was rejected by the Tokyo High Court on 28 July 2003 and the sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court of Japan on 6 November 2009. Hirose was executed at the Tokyo Detention House on 26 July 2018, along with five other cult members.

==== Kōichi Kitamura ====
 was 27 years old when the attack was committed. He is currently serving a life sentence for the attack and other offenses.

Kitamura is a native of Aichi Prefecture and joined Aum Shinrikyo in the late 1980s after reading a book written by leader Shoko Asahara.

During the attack he drove Hirose to the Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line where Hirose boarded a train and punctured two bags of liquid sarin, causing the death of one person. Kitamura also aided cult fugitive Takeshi Matsumoto in hiding from justice between the months of March and April 1995 for the crime of kidnapping.

He was a fugitive until November 1996 when he was arrested in Tokorozawa, Saitama. In his first trial in May 1997 he admitted to the crimes and reportedly renounced the cult although he maintained the belief that Asahara had superpowers and his lawyer said that he still was under the spell of the cult.

Kitamura was sentenced to life imprisonment in November 1999, with the presiding judge chastising him for playing an &quot;indispensable role&quot; in the attack. The judge also highlighted his self-righteous motive for his crimes and pronounced the sentencing saying that:

After the verdict was read, his lawyer said that Kitamura was still under Asahara&#x27;s spell which made him a victim of the cult as well. He also said that the court had dismissed this point adding that he would discuss with him whether to appeal to the higher courts.

In January 2002, the Tokyo High Court upheld Kitamura&#x27;s sentence, which he called &quot;too harsh&quot; given his role in the attack. The court refuted his argument and highlighted his lack of remorse as motive for upholding the sentence.

=== Train B801 (Ikebukuro-bound Marunouchi Line) ===
==== Toru Toyoda ====
Toru Toyoda (23 January 1968 – 26 July 2018) was 27 years old at the time of the attack. He studied Applied Physics at University of Tokyo&#x27;s Science Department and graduated with honors. He also held a master&#x27;s degree, and was about to begin doctoral studies when he joined Aum, where he belonged to the Chemical Brigade in their Ministry of Science and Technology.

Toyoda was sentenced to death. The appeal against his death sentence was rejected by the Tokyo High Court on 28 July 2003, and was upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2009. Toyoda was executed at the Tokyo Detention House on 26 July 2018.

==== Katsuya Takahashi ====
Katsuya Takahashi, who was 37 years old at the time of the attack, was Toyoda&#x27;s getaway driver. Takahashi was arrested in June 2012. He was the last of the wanted fugitives of the attack to be arrested.

In 2015, Takahashi was convicted for his role in the attack and was sentenced to life in prison. His appeal was rejected by the Tokyo High Court in September 2016.

=== Train B711T (Tōbu Dōbutsu Kōen-bound Hibiya Line train) ===
==== Masato Yokoyama ====
Yokoyama (19 October 1963 – 26 July 2018) was 31 at the time of the attack. He was a graduate in Applied Physics from Tokai University&#x27;s Engineering Department. He worked for an electronics firm in Gunma Prefecture for three years after graduation before leaving to join Aum, where he became Undersecretary at the group&#x27;s Ministry of Science and Technology. He was also involved in their Automatic Light Weapons Manufacturing scheme. Yokoyama was sentenced to death in 1999. His appeals were rejected, and he was executed at the Nagoya Detention House on 26 July 2018.

==== Kiyotaka Tonozaki ====
Kiyotaka Tonozaki, a high school graduate who joined the group in 1987, was Yokoyama&#x27;s getaway driver. Tonozaki was 31 years old at the time of the attacks. He was a member of the group&#x27;s Ministry of Construction. Tonozaki was sentenced to life imprisonment.

=== Train A720S (Naka-Meguro-bound Hibiya Line train) ===
==== Yasuo Hayashi ====
Yasuo Hayashi (15 December 1957 – 26 July 2018) was 37 years old at the time of the attacks, and was the oldest person at the group&#x27;s Ministry of Science and Technology. He studied Artificial Intelligence at Kogakuin University; after graduation he traveled to India where he studied yoga. He then became an Aum member, taking vows in 1988 and rising to the number three position in the group&#x27;s Ministry of Science and Technology.

Asahara had at one time suspected Hayashi of being a spy. The extra packet of sarin he carried was part of &quot;ritual character test&quot; set up by Asahara to prove his allegiance, according to the prosecution.
Hayashi fled after the attacks. He was arrested 21 months later, one thousand miles from Tokyo on Ishigaki Island. He was later sentenced to death. His appeal was rejected by the Tokyo High Court in 2008. Hayashi was executed at the Sendai Detention House on 26 July 2018.

==== Shigeo Sugimoto ====
Hayashi&#x27;s getaway driver was 36-year-old Shigeo Sugimoto, whose lawyers argued he played only a minor role in the attack, but the argument was rejected and he was sentenced to life in prison.

=== Naoko Kikuchi ===
Naoko Kikuchi, who was involved in producing the sarin gas, was 24 years old at the time of the attacks. She was arrested after a tipoff in June 2012, but was acquitted in 2015 on the grounds that she was unaware of the plot.

== Aftermath ==
Following the attack, Japanese police raided Aum Shinrikyo facilities and arrested members. The cult&#x27;s headquarters in Tokyo was raided by police on 16 May 1995. Due to fears that armed cult members might resist the raid, the 1st Airborne Brigade of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force was stationed nearby to provide support if needed.

=== Injuries and deaths ===

On the day of the attack, ambulances transported 688 patients and nearly 5,000 people reached hospitals by other means. In total, 278 hospitals saw 5,510 patients – 17 of whom were deemed critical, 37 severe, and 984 moderately ill with vision problems. About 85% of those reporting to hospitals were the &quot;worried well&quot;, or psychogenic patients, who had to be distinguished from those who had physical symptoms. The categorization was that a moderate casualty just had miosis (excessive constriction of the pupil), a severe casualty was short of breath or had muscular twitching or gastrointestinal problems as well as miosis, and a severe or critical casualty required intensive care unit care.
Several of those affected by sarin went to work in spite of their symptoms, not realizing that they had been exposed to sarin. Most of the victims sought medical treatment as the symptoms worsened and as they learned of the actual circumstances of the attacks via news broadcasts.

By mid-afternoon, over 500 mildly affected victims had recovered from vision problems and were released from hospital. Most of the remaining patients were well enough to go home the following day, and within a week only a few critical patients remained in hospital. The death toll on the day of the attack was eight, with four more dying subsequently. Hospitals only became aware that sarin was involved after about two hours, and then started administering 2-PAM and atropine.

Several of those affected were exposed to sarin only by helping those who had been directly exposed. Among these were passengers on other trains, subway workers and health care workers.

A 2008 law enacted by the Japanese government authorized payments of damages to victims of the gas attack, because the attack was directed at the government of Japan. As of December 2009, 5,259 people have applied for benefits under the law. Of those, 47 out of 70 have been certified as disabled and 1,077 of 1,163 applications for serious injuries or illnesses have been certified.

Surveys of the victims in 1998 and 2001 showed that many were still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. In one survey 20% of 837 respondents complained that they felt insecure when on a train, while 10% answered that they tried to avoid any nerve-attack related news. Over 60% reported chronic eyestrain and said their vision had worsened.

Until 2008, 12 fatalities resulting from the attack had been officially acknowledged. However, in 2008 a survey of victims was conducted by the prefectural police department for the purpose of allocating compensation. This survey determined that a man who had died the day after the attack had also been killed by sarin inhalation, thereby increasing the officially recognised death toll to 13. On 10 March 2020, another victim, who had been bedridden for 25 years since the attack, died. 56-year-old Sachiko Asakawa&#x27;s cause of death was determined to be hypoxic encephalopathy caused by sarin poisoning; she is considered the attack&#x27;s 14th fatality.

=== Emergency services ===
At the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (TMPD) , the Operations Center of the Criminal Investigation Bureau received the first report at 8:10 a.m.: “There appears to be an explosion in the subway yard.&quot; Because of this initial misinformation, more than 30 police officers, including police captains attempting to take command, inadvertently entered the crime scene and were harmed by the sarin gas. 

Forensic Science Laboratory had been gathering information on sarin based on lessons learned from the Matsumoto incident, and by 10:30 a.m., they had discovered that the causative agent was sarin. On the scene, however, treatment was initiated even earlier than the laboratory report came in, assuming nerve agents . Dr. Nobuo Yanagisawa, the Director of Shinshu University Hospital and experienced with treating sarin poisoning after the Matsumoto incident, decided to share information with hospitals in Tokyo that were accepting victims. St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital, the hospital that had received the largest number of victims, had already begun treatment with the assumption of nerve agents, and after receiving a call from Dr. Yanagisawa at 10:15 a.m., they thought it was more likely to be sarin. After completing the call with St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, Dr. Yanagisawa faxed his report on the incident in Matsumoto to major hospitals in Tokyo. A medical team from the Self-Defense Forces Hospital that had been dispatched to the police hospital was also to move to St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital, arriving at 10:30 a.m. Dr. Hikaru Aoki, a physician being part of this team, had brought with him materials from a course he had taken the day before on “Medicine Against Chemical Weapons,” just after taking it. This hospital was one of very few hospitals in Tokyo at that time to have the entire building wired and piped for conversion into a &quot;field hospital&quot; in the event of a major disaster. This proved to be a very fortunate coincidence as the hospital was able to take in most of the 600+ victims at Tsukiji Station, resulting in no fatalities at that station.

As there was a severe shortage of antidotes in Tokyo, sarin antidote stored in rural hospitals as an antidote for herbicide/insecticide poisoning was delivered to nearby Shinkansen stations, where it was collected by the workers of Suzuken, a drug wholesaling company, on a train bound for Tokyo. An Osaka company that manufactured 2-PAM rushed emergency supplies to Tokyo unsolicited on hearing the news.

The TMPD had already been preparing for a mandatory investigation of the Aum cult as a danger, and based on the lessons learned from the Matsumoto incident, had procured chemical protective clothing from its own budget and sent riot specialists and detectives to JGSDF Chemical School to receive training in dealing with sarin gas. However, since the police officers had only basic training and could not handle a large-scale terrorism attack of this magnitude, the TMPD recognized the need to immediately request assistance from the JGSDF. At 12:50 a.m., the Governor of Tokyo, Yukio Aoshima, issued a disaster relief request to the JGSDF 1st Division. The division&#x27;s 32nd Infantry Regiment and Chemical Protection Platoon, along with a chemical protection platoon from the 12th Division, the 101st Chemical Protection Unit from the Eastern Army, and instructors from the Chemical School, were dispatched to decontaminate contaminated stations and vehicles.

=== Defense offered by Japanese and American scholars ===
Aum had carefully cultivated the friendship of Japanese scholars of religion. After the sarin gas attack, some of them, including Shimada Hiromi, a professor at Tokyo&#x27;s Japan Women&#x27;s University, suggested Aum may be innocent. Shimada later apologized, claiming he had been deceived by Aum, but his and others&#x27; statements damaged the public image of scholars of religion in general in Japan. Shimada later had to resign from his academic position.

In May 1995, Aum contacted an American group known as AWARE (Association of World Academics for Religious Education), founded by American scholar James R. Lewis, claiming that the human rights of its members were being violated. Lewis recruited human rights lawyer Barry Fisher, scholar of religion J. Gordon Melton, and chemical expert Thomas Banigan. They flew to Japan, with their travel expenses paid by Aum, and announced that they will investigate and report through press conferences at the end of their trip.

In the press conferences, Fisher and Lewis announced that Aum could not have produced the sarin with which the attacks had been committed. They had determined this, Lewis said, with their technical expert, based on photos and documents provided by the group.

However, the Japanese police had already discovered a sophisticated chemical weapons laboratory at Aum&#x27;s main compound in March. The facility was capable of producing thousands of kilograms of sarin a year; far in excess of what was used. Later investigation showed that Aum not only created the sarin used in the subway attacks, but had committed previous chemical and biological weapons attacks, including a previous attack with sarin that killed eight people and injured 144.

British scholar of Japanese religions Ian Reader, in a detailed account of the incident, reported that Melton &quot;had few doubts by the end of his visit to Japan of Aum’s complicity&quot; and eventually &quot;concluded that Aum had in fact been involved in the attack and other crimes&quot; In fact, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; account of the final press conference mentioned Lewis and Fisher but not Melton. A Christian anti-cult Web site called Apologetic Index quoted the &quot;Washington Post&quot; article and implied that Melton had spoken in the press conference. Melton was, however, not mentioned in the original &quot;Washington Post&quot; article.

Lewis, on the other hand, maintained his opinion that Aum had been framed, and wrote that having the trip funded by Aum had been arranged &quot;so that financial considerations would not be attached to our final report&quot;.

Reader concluded that, &quot;The visit was well-intentioned, and the participants were genuinely concerned about possible violations of civil rights in the wake of the extensive police investigations and detentions of followers.&quot; However, it was ill-fated and detrimental to the reputation of those involved. While distinguishing between Lewis&#x27; and Melton&#x27;s attitudes, Reader observed that Melton was criticized as well by both Japanese media and some fellow scholars. Using stronger words, Canadian scholar Stephen A. Kent chastised both Lewis and Melton for having put the reputation of the whole category of scholars of new religious movements at risk.

=== Murakami book ===
Popular contemporary novelist Haruki Murakami wrote &quot;Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche&quot; (1997). He was critical of the Japanese media for focusing on the sensational profiles of the attackers and ignoring the lives of the victimized average citizens. The book contains extensive interviews with the survivors, telling their stories. Murakami later added a second part to the work, &quot;The Place That Was Promised&quot;. The additional section consists of a series of interviews with present and former Aum Shinrikyo members, first published in Bungei Shunjū.

=== Aum/Aleph today ===
The sarin attack was the most serious attack upon Japan since World War II. Shortly after the attack, Aum lost its status as a religious organization, and many of its assets were seized. The Diet (Japanese parliament) rejected a request from government officials to outlaw the group. The National Public Safety Commission received increased funding to monitor the group. In 1999, the Diet gave the commission broad powers to monitor and curtail the activities of groups that have been involved in &quot;indiscriminate mass murder&quot; and whose leaders are &quot;holding strong sway over their members&quot;, a bill custom-tailored to Aum Shinrikyo.

Asahara was sentenced to death by hanging on 27 February 2004, but lawyers immediately appealed the ruling. The Tokyo High Court postponed its decision on the appeal until results were obtained from a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, which was issued to determine whether Asahara was fit to stand trial. In February 2006, the court ruled that Asahara was indeed fit to stand trial, and on 27 March 2006, rejected the appeal against his death sentence. Japan&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld this decision on 15 September 2006. Two re-trial appeals were declined by the appellate court. In June 2012, Asahara&#x27;s execution was postponed due to the further arrests of the two remaining Aum Shinrikyo members wanted in connection with the attack. Japan does not announce dates of executions, which are by hanging, in advance of them being carried out. On 6 July 2018, the Ministry of Justice announced that Asahara had been executed that morning with six others of those principally involved.

On 27 November 2004, all the Aum trials concluded, excluding Asahara&#x27;s, as the death sentence of Seiichi Endo was upheld by Japan&#x27;s Supreme Court. As a result, among a total of 189 members indicted, 13 were sentenced to death, five were sentenced to life in prison, 80 were given prison sentences of various lengths, 87 received suspended sentences, two were fined, and one was found not guilty.

In May and June 2012, the last two of the fugitives wanted in connection with the attack were arrested in the Tokyo and Kanagawa area. Of them, Katsuya Takahashi, was taken into custody by police near a comic book cafe in Tokyo.

The group reportedly still has about 2,100 members, and continues to recruit new members under the name &quot;Aleph&quot; as well as other names. Though the group has renounced its violent past, it still continues to follow Asahara&#x27;s spiritual teachings. Members operate several businesses, though boycotts of known Aleph-related businesses, in addition to searches, confiscations of possible evidence and picketing by protest groups, have resulted in closures.

== In popular culture ==
* In the novel &quot;The Fine Art of Invisible Detection&quot;, the main character&#x27;s husband is a victim of the attack.
* In the anime &quot;Mawaru Penguindrum&quot;, the fates of a handful of characters are explored and intertwined through a subway terrorist attack. Many references to the year 1995 are presented as well.
* The 1995 video game &quot;The Story of Kamikuishiki Village&quot; satirizes the attack and Aum Shinrikyo as a whole, mocking its members and showcasing &quot;humiliating&quot; news coverage of the event.
