<text>Persian literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in the Persian language and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest literatures. It spans over two-and-a-half millennia. Its sources have been within Greater Iran including present-day Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Caucasus, and Turkey, regions of Central Asia (such as Tajikistan), South Asia and the Balkans where the Persian language has historically been either the native or official language.

For example, Rumi, one of the best-loved Persian poets, born in Balkh (in modern-day Afghanistan) or Wakhsh (in modern-day Tajikistan), wrote in Persian and lived in Konya (in modern-day Turkey), at that time the capital of the Seljuks in Anatolia. The Ghaznavids conquered large territories in Central and South Asia and adopted Persian as their court language. There is thus Persian literature from Iran, Mesopotamia, Azerbaijan, the wider Caucasus, Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Tajikistan and other parts of Central Asia, as well as the Balkans. Not all Persian literature is written in Persian, as some consider works written by ethnic Persians or Iranians in other languages, such as Greek and Arabic, to be included. 

At the same time, not all literature written in Persian is written by ethnic Persians or Iranians, as Turkic, Caucasian, Indic and Slavic poets and writers have also used the Persian language in the environment of Persianate cultures.

Described as one of the great literatures of humanity, including Goethe&#x27;s assessment of it as one of the four main bodies of world literature, Persian literature has its roots in surviving works of Middle Persian and Old Persian, the latter of which dates back as far as 522 BCE, the date of the earliest surviving Achaemenid inscription, the Behistun Inscription. The bulk of surviving Persian literature, however, comes from the times following the Muslim conquest of Persia c. 650 CE. After the Abbasids came to power (750 CE), the Iranians became the scribes and bureaucrats of the Islamic Caliphate and, increasingly, also its writers and poets. The New Persian language literature arose and flourished in Khorasan and Transoxiana because of political reasons, early Iranian dynasties of post-Islamic Iran such as the Tahirids and Samanids being based in Khorasan.

Persian poets such as Ferdowsi, Saadi, Hafiz, Attar, Nezami, Rumi and Omar Khayyam are also known in the West and have influenced the literature of many countries.

== Classical Persian literature ==
=== Pre-Islamic Persian literature ===
Very few literary works of Achaemenid Iran have survived, partly due to the destruction of the library at Persepolis. Most of what remains consists of the royal inscriptions of Achaemenid kings, particularly Darius I (522–486 BC) and his son Xerxes. Many Zoroastrian writings were destroyed in the Islamic conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The Parsis who fled to India, however, took with them some of the books of the Zoroastrian canon, including some of the Avesta and ancient commentaries (Zend) thereof. Some works of Sassanid geography and travel also survived, albeit in Arabic translations.

No single text devoted to literary criticism has survived from pre-Islamic Iran. However, some essays in Pahlavi, such as &quot;Ayin-e name nebeshtan&quot; (Principles of Writing Book) and &quot;Bab-e edteda’I-ye&quot; (Kalileh o Demneh), have been considered as literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1959).

Some researchers have quoted the &quot;Sho&#x27;ubiyye&quot; as asserting that the pre-Islamic Iranians had books on eloquence, such as &#x27;Karvand&#x27;. No trace remains of such books. There are some indications that some among the Persian elite were familiar with Greek rhetoric and literary criticism (Zarrinkoub, 1947).

=== Persian literature of the medieval and pre-modern periods ===
While initially overshadowed by Arabic during the Umayyad and early Abbasid caliphates, New Persian soon became a literary language again of the Central Asian and West Asian lands. The rebirth of the language in its new form is often accredited to Ferdowsi, Unsuri, Daqiqi, Rudaki, and their generation, as they used pre-Islamic nationalism as a conduit to revive the language and customs of ancient Iran.

==== Poetry ====

So strong is the Persian inclination to versifying everyday expressions that one can encounter poetry in almost every classical work, whether from Persian literature, science, or metaphysics. In short, the ability to write in verse form was a pre-requisite for any scholar. For example, almost half of Avicenna&#x27;s medical writings are in verse.

Works of the early era of Persian poetry are characterized by strong court patronage, an extravagance of panegyrics, and what is known as &quot;exalted in style&quot;. The tradition of royal patronage began perhaps under the Sassanid era and carried over through the Abbasid and Samanid courts into every major Iranian dynasty. The Qasida was perhaps the most famous form of panegyric used, though quatrains such as those in Omar Khayyam&#x27;s Ruba&#x27;iyyat are also widely popular.

Khorasani style, whose followers mostly were associated with Greater Khorasan, is characterized by its supercilious diction, dignified tone, and relatively literate language. The chief representatives of this lyricism are Asjadi, Farrukhi Sistani, Unsuri, and Manuchehri. Panegyric masters such as Rudaki were known for their love of nature, their verses abounding with evocative descriptions.

Through these courts and system of patronage emerged the epic style of poetry, with Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnama&quot; at the apex. By glorifying the Iranian historical past in heroic and elevated verses, he and other notables such as Daqiqi and Asadi Tusi presented the &quot;Ajam&quot; with a source of pride and inspiration that has helped preserve a sense of identity for the Iranian people over the ages. Ferdowsi set a model to be followed by a host of other poets later on.

The 13th century marks the ascendancy of lyric poetry with the consequent development of the ghazal into a major verse form, as well as the rise of mystical and Sufi poetry. This style is often called Araqi (Iraqi) style (Araq-e-Ajam) and is known by its emotional lyric qualities, rich meters, and the relative simplicity of its language. Emotional romantic poetry was not something new, however, as works such as Vis o Ramin by As&#x27;ad Gorgani, and &quot;Yusof o Zoleikha&quot; by Am&#x27;aq Bokharai exemplify. Poets such as Sana&#x27;i and Attar (who ostensibly inspired Rumi), Khaqani Shirvani, Anvari, and Nizami, were highly respected ghazal writers. However, the elite of this school are Rumi, Saadi, and Hafiz Shirazi.

Regarding the tradition of Persian love poetry during the Safavid era, Persian historian Ehsan Yarshater notes, &quot;As a rule, the beloved is not a woman, but a young man. In the early centuries of Islam, the raids into Central Asia produced many young slaves. Slaves were also bought or received as gifts. They were made to serve as pages at court or in the households of the affluent, or as soldiers and bodyguards. Young men, slaves or not, also, served wine at banquets and receptions, and the more gifted among them could play music and maintain a cultivated conversation. It was love toward young pages, soldiers, or novices in trades and professions which was the subject of lyrical introductions to panegyrics from the beginning of Persian poetry, and of the ghazal. &quot; During the same Safavid era, many subjects of the Iranian Safavids were patrons of Persian poetry, such as Teimuraz I of Kakheti.

In the didactic genre one can mention Sanai&#x27;s &quot;Hadiqat-ul-Haqiqah&quot; (Garden of Truth) as well as Nizami&#x27;s &quot;Makhzan-ul-Asrār&quot; (Treasury of Secrets). Some of Attar&#x27;s works also belong to this genre as do the major works of Rumi, although some tend to classify these in the lyrical type due to their mystical and emotional qualities. In addition, some tend to group Naser Khosrow&#x27;s works in this style as well; however true gems of this genre are two books by Saadi, a heavyweight of Persian literature, the &quot;Bustan&quot; and the &quot;Gulistan&quot;.

After the 15th century, the Indian style of Persian poetry (sometimes also called &quot;Isfahani&quot; or &quot;Safavi&quot; styles) took over. This style has its roots in the Timurid era and produced the likes of Amir Khosrow Dehlavi, and Bhai Nand Lal Goya.

==== Prose writings ====
The most significant prose writings of this era are Nizami Arudhi Samarqandi&#x27;s &quot;Chahār Maqāleh&quot; as well as Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi&#x27;s anecdote compendium &quot;Jawami ul-Hikayat&quot;.
Shams al-Mo&#x27;ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir&#x27;s famous work, the &quot;Qabus nama&quot; (&quot;A Mirror for Princes&quot;), is a highly esteemed Belles-lettres work of Persian literature. Also highly regarded is &quot;Siyasatnama&quot;, by Nizam al-Mulk, a famous Persian vizier. &quot;Kelileh va Demneh&quot;, translated from Indian folk tales, can also be mentioned in this category. It is seen as a collection of adages in Persian literary studies and thus does not convey folkloric notions.

==== Biographies, hagiographies, and historical works ====
Among the major historical and biographical works in classical Persian, one can mention Abolfazl Beyhaghi&#x27;s famous &quot;Tarikh-i Beyhaqi&quot;, &quot;Lubab ul-Albab&quot; of Zahiriddin Nasr Muhammad Aufi (which has been regarded as a reliable chronological source by many experts), as well as Ata-Malik Juvayni&#x27;s famous &quot;Tarikh-i Jahangushay-i Juvaini&quot; (which spans the Mongolid and Ilkhanid era of Iran). Attar&#x27;s &quot;Tazkerat-ol-Owliya&quot; (&quot;Biographies of the Saints&quot;) is also a detailed account of Sufi mystics, which is referenced by many subsequent authors and considered a significant work in mystical hagiography.

==== Literary criticism ====
The oldest surviving work of Persian literary criticism after the Islamic conquest of Persia is &quot;Muqaddame-ye Shahname-ye Abu Mansuri&quot;, which was written during the Samanid period. The work deals with the myths and legends of &quot;Shahnameh&quot; and is considered the oldest surviving example of Persian prose. It also shows an attempt by the authors to evaluate literary works critically.

==== Storytelling ====
&quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; () is a medieval folk tale collection which tells the story of Scheherazade ( &quot;Šahrzād&quot;), a Sassanid queen who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar ( &quot;Šahryār&quot;), to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over several centuries, by many people from a number of different lands.

The nucleus of the collection is formed by a Pahlavi Sassanid Persian book called &quot;Hazār Afsānah&quot; (, &quot;Thousand Myths&quot;), a collection of ancient Indian and Persian folk tales.

During the reign of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an important cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and 9th-century translator into Arabic is reputedly the storyteller &quot;Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar&quot;. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.

==Persian dictionaries==
The biggest Persian dictionary is &quot;Dehkhoda Dictionary&quot; (16 volumes) by
Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda. It is the largest comprehensive Persian dictionary ever published, comprising 16 volumes (more than 27,000 pages). It is published by the Tehran University Press (UTP) under the supervision of the Dehkhoda Dictionary Institute and was first published in 1931. It traces the historical development of the Persian language, providing a comprehensive resource to scholars and academic researchers, as well as describing usage in its many variations throughout the world.
He names 200 Persian lexicographical works in his dictionary, the earliest, &quot;Farhang-i Oim&quot; () and &quot;Farhang-i Menakhtay&quot; (), from the late Sassanid era of the 3rd-7th century.

The most widely used Persian lexicons in the Middle Ages were those of Abu Hafs Sughdi () and Asadi Tusi (), written in 1092.

The production of Persian dictionaries declined in Iran after the 14th century, while it simultaneously grew in the Indian subcontinent and Ottoman Turkey, regions that were increasingly becoming Persianized. Only 4 dictionaries of Persian were compiled in Iran between the 10th and 19th centuries, while more than 66 were produced in India. Significant dictionaries from India include the &quot;Farhang-e Ghavvas,&quot; &quot;Sharafnama-ye Ebrahimi&quot;, &quot;Farhang-i Jahangiri&quot;, and &quot;Burhan-i Qati&quot;. Unlike the Persian dictionaries of India, most dictionaries from Ottoman Turkey are bilingual (Persian-Turkish). Some significant dictionaries of the era are &quot;Oqnum-e Ajam&quot;, &quot;Loghat-e Ne&#x27;matallah&quot;, and &quot;Lesan al-Ajam.&quot;

In 1645, Christian Ravius completed a Persian-Latin dictionary, printed at Leiden. This was followed by John Richardson&#x27;s two-volume Oxford edition (1777) and Gladwin-Malda&#x27;s (1770) Persian-English Dictionaries, Scharif and S. Peters&#x27; Persian-Russian Dictionary (1869), and 30 other Persian lexicographical translations through the 1950s.

Currently, English-Persian dictionaries of Manouchehr Aryanpour and Soleiman Haim are widely used in Iran. Also highly regarded in the contemporary Persian literature lexical corpus are the works of Dr. Mohammad Moin. The first volume of Moin Dictionary was published in 1963.

== Influence ==

=== Sufi literature ===
Some of Persia&#x27;s best-beloved medieval poets were Sufis, and their poetry was, and is, widely read by Sufis from Morocco to Indonesia. Rumi, in particular, is renowned both as a poet and as the founder of a widespread Sufi order. Hafez, too, is hugely admired in both East and West, and he was inspired by Sufism if he was not actually a Sufi himself. The themes and styles of this kind of devotional poetry have been widely imitated by many Sufi and non-Sufi poets. See also the article on Sufi poetry.

Many notable texts in Persian mystic literature are not poems, yet highly read and regarded. Among those are &quot;Kimiya-yi sa&#x27;ādat&quot;, &quot;Asrar al-Tawhid&quot; and &quot;Kashf ul Mahjoob&quot;.

=== Georgian literature ===
Beginning in the early 16th century, Persian traditions had a large impact on the Georgian ruling elites, which in turn resulted in Persian influence on Georgian art, architecture, and literature. This cultural influence lasted until the arrival of the Russians.

Jamshid Sh. Giunashvili remarks on the connection of Georgian culture with that of the Persian literary work &quot;Shahnameh&quot;:

Farmanfarmaian in the &quot;Journal of Persianate Studies&quot;:

=== Asia Minor ===
Despite that Asia Minor (or Anatolia) had been ruled various times prior to the Middle Ages by various Persian-speaking dynasties originating in Iran, the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the Sassanian Empire. Centuries later however, the practise and usage in the region would be strongly revived. A branch of the Seljuks, the Sultanate of Rum, took Persian language, art and letters to Anatolia. They adopted Persian language as the official language of the empire. The Ottomans, which can &quot;roughly&quot; be seen as their eventual successors, took this tradition over. Persian was the official court language of the empire, and for some time, the official language of the empire. The educated and noble class of the Ottoman Empire all spoke Persian, such as sultan Selim I, despite being Safavid Iran&#x27;s archrival and a staunch opposer of Shia Islam. It was a major literary language in the empire. Some of the noted earlier Persian literature works during the Ottoman rule are Idris Bidlisi&#x27;s &quot;Hasht Bihisht&quot;, which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight Ottoman rulers, and the &quot;Salim-Namah&quot;, a glorification of Selim I. After a period of several centuries, Ottoman Turkish (which was highly Persianised itself) had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature, which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation. However, the number of Persian and Arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%. The Ottomans produced thousands of Persian literary works throughout their century long lifespan.

=== South Asia ===

With the emergence of the Ghaznavids and their successors such as the Ghurids, Timurids and Mughal Empire, Persian culture and its literature gradually moved into South Asia too. In general, from its earliest days, Persian literature and language was imported into the subcontinent by culturally Persianised Turkic and Afghan dynasties. Persian became the language of the nobility, literary circles, and the royal Mughal courts for hundreds of years. In the early 19th century, Hindustani replaced it.

Under the Mughal Empire during the 16th century, the official language of the Indian subcontinent became Persian. Only in 1832 did the British army force the South Asia to begin conducting business in English. Persian poetry in fact flourished in these regions while post-Safavid Iranian literature stagnated. Dehkhoda and other scholars of the 20th century, for example, largely based their works on the detailed lexicography produced in India, using compilations such as Ghazi khan Badr Muhammad Dehlavi&#x27;s &quot;Adat al-Fudhala&quot; (), Ibrahim Ghavamuddin Farughi&#x27;s &quot;Farhang-i Ibrahimi&quot; (), and particularly Muhammad Padshah&#x27;s &quot;Farhang-i Anandraj&quot; ().

=== Balkans ===

Persian learning was also widespread in the Ottoman-held Balkans (&quot;Rumelia&quot;), with a range of cities being famed for their long-standing traditions in the study of Persian and its classics, amongst them Saraybosna (modern Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina), Mostar (also in Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Vardar Yenicesi (or Yenice-i Vardar, now Giannitsa, in the northern part of Greece).

Vardar Yenicesi differed from other localities in the Balkans insofar as that it was a town where Persian was also widely spoken. However, the Persian of Vardar Yenicesi and throughout the rest of the Ottoman-held Balkans was different from formal Persian both in accent and vocabulary. The difference was apparent to such a degree that the Ottomans referred to it as &quot;Rumelian Persian&quot; (&quot;Rumili Farsisi&quot;). As learned people such as students, scholars and literati often frequented Vardar Yenicesi, it soon became the site of a flourishing Persianate linguistic and literary culture. The 16th-century Ottoman Aşık Çelebi (died 1572), who hailed from Prizren in modern-day Kosovo, was galvanized by the abundant Persian-speaking and Persian-writing communities of Vardar Yenicesi, and he referred to the city as a &quot;hotbed of Persian&quot;.

Many Ottoman Persianists who established a career in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) pursued early Persian training in Saraybosna, amongst them Ahmed Sudi.

=== Western literature ===
Persian literature was little known in the West before the 18-19th century. It became much better known following the publication of several translations from the works of late medieval Persian poets, and it inspired works by various Western poets and writers.

==== German literature ====
* In 1819, Goethe published his &quot;West-östlicher Divan&quot;, a collection of lyric poems inspired by a German translation of Hafiz (1326–1390).
* The German essayist and philosopher Nietzsche was the author of the book &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; (1883–1885), referring to the ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster (c. 1700 BCE).

==== English literature ====
* A selection from Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; (935–1020) was published in 1832 by James Atkinson, a physician employed by the British East India Company.
* A portion of this abridgment was later versified by the British poet Matthew Arnold in his 1853 &quot;Rustam and Sohrab&quot;.
* The American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson was another admirer of Persian poetry. He published several essays in 1876 that discuss Persian poetry: &quot;Letters and Social Aims&quot;, &quot;From the Persian of Hafiz&quot;, and &quot;Ghaselle&quot;.

Perhaps the most popular Persian poet of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Omar Khayyam (1048–1123), whose &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; was freely translated by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859. Khayyam is esteemed more as a scientist than a poet in his native Persia, but in Fitzgerald&#x27;s rendering, he became one of the most quoted poets in English. Khayyam&#x27;s line, &quot;A loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou&quot;, is known to many who could not say who wrote it, or where:

The Persian poet and mystic Rumi (1207–1273) (known as Molana in Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and as Mevlana in Turkey), has attracted a large following in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Popularizing translations by Coleman Barks have presented Rumi as a New Age sage. There are also a number of more literary translations by scholars such as A. J. Arberry.

The classical poets (Hafiz, Saadi, Khayyam, Rumi, Nizami and Ferdowsi) are now widely known in English and can be read in various translations. Other works of Persian literature are untranslated and little known.

==== Swedish literature ====
During the last century, numerous works of classical Persian literature have been translated into Swedish by baron Eric Hermelin. He translated works by, among others, Farid al-Din Attar, Rumi, Ferdowsi, Omar Khayyam, Saadi and Sanai. Influenced by the writings of the Swedish mystic Emanuel Swedenborg, he was especially attracted to the religious or Sufi aspects of classical Persian poetry. His translations have had a great impact on numerous modern Swedish writers, among them Karl Wennberg, Willy Kyrklund and Gunnar Ekelöf. More recently classical authors such as Hafez, Rumi, Araqi and Nizami Aruzi have been rendered into Swedish by the Iranist Ashk Dahlén, who has published several essays on the development of Persian literature. Excerpts from Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot; has also been translated into Swedish prose by Namdar Nasser and Anja Malmberg.

==== Italian literature ====
During the last century, numerous works of classical and modern Persian literature have been translated into Italian by Alessandro Bausani (Nizami, Rumi, Iqbal, Khayyam), Carlo Saccone (&#x27;Attar, Sana&#x27;i, Hafiz, Nasir-i Khusraw, Nizami, Ahmad Ghazali, Ansari of Herat, Sa&#x27;di, Ayené), Angelo Piemontese (Amir Khusraw Dihlavi), Pio Filippani-Ronconi (Nasir-i Khusraw, Sa&#x27;di), Riccardo Zipoli (Kay Ka&#x27;us, Bidil), Maurizio Pistoso (Nizam al-Mulk), Giorgio Vercellin (Nizami &#x27;Aruzi), Giovanni Maria D&#x27;Erme (&#x27;Ubayd Zakani, Hafiz), Sergio Foti (Suhrawardi, Rumi, Jami), Rita Bargigli (Sa&#x27;di, Farrukhi, Manuchehri, &#x27;Unsuri), Nahid Norozi (Sohrab Sepehri, Khwaju of Kerman, Ahmad Shamlu), Faezeh Mardani (Forugh Farrokhzad, Abbas Kiarostami). A complete translation of Firdawsi&#x27;s &quot;Shah-nama&quot; was made by Italo Pizzi in the 19th century.

== Contemporary Persian literature ==
=== History ===

In the 19th century, Persian literature experienced dramatic change and entered a new era. The beginning of this change was exemplified by an incident in the mid-19th century at the court of Nasereddin Shah, when the reform-minded prime minister, Amir Kabir, chastised the poet Habibollah Qa&#x27;ani Shirazi for &quot;lying&quot; in a panegyric qasida written in Kabir&#x27;s honor. Kabir saw poetry in general and the type of poetry that had developed during the Qajar period as detrimental to &quot;progress&quot; and &quot;modernization&quot; in Iranian society, which he believed was in dire need of change. Such concerns were also expressed by others such as Fath-&#x27;Ali Akhundzadeh, Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani, and Mirza Malkom Khan. Khan also addressed a need for a change in Persian poetry in literary terms as well, always linking it to social concerns.
The new Persian literary movement cannot be understood without an understanding of the intellectual movements among Iranian philosophical circles. Given the social and political climate of Persia (Iran) in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which led to the Persian Constitutional Revolution of 1906–1911, the idea that change in poetry was necessary became widespread. Many argued that Persian poetry should reflect the realities of a country in transition. This idea was propagated by notable literary figures such as Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda and Abolqasem Aref, who challenged the traditional system of Persian poetry in terms of introducing new content and experimentation with rhetoric, lexico-semantics, and structure. Dehkhoda, for instance, used a lesser-known traditional form, the mosammat, to elegize the execution of a revolutionary journalist. &#x27;Aref employed the ghazal, &quot;the most central genre within the lyrical tradition&quot; (p.  88), to write his &quot;Payam-e Azadi&quot; (Message of Freedom).

Some researchers argue that the notion of &quot;sociopolitical ramifications of esthaetic changes&quot; led to the idea of poets &quot;as social leaders trying the limits and possibilities of social change&quot;.

An important movement in modern Persian literature centered on the question of modernization and Westernization and whether these terms are synonymous when describing the evolution of Iranian society. It can be argued that almost all advocates of modernism in Persian literature, from Akhundzadeh, Kermani, and Malkom Khan to Dehkhoda, Aref, Bahar, and Taqi Rafat, were inspired by developments and changes that had occurred in Western, particularly European, literatures. Such inspirations did not mean blindly copying Western models but, rather, adapting aspects of Western literature and changing them to fit the needs of Iranian culture.

Following the pioneering works of Ahmad Kasravi, Sadeq Hedayat and many others, the Iranian wave of comparative literature and literary criticism reached a symbolic crest with the emergence of Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub, Shahrokh Meskoob, Houshang Golshiri and Ebrahim Golestan.

=== In Afghanistan ===
Persian literature in Afghanistan has also experienced a dramatic change during the last century. At the beginning of the 20th century, Afghanistan was confronted with economic and social change, which sparked a new approach to literature. In 1911, Mahmud Tarzi, who came back to Afghanistan after years of exile in Turkey and was influential in government circles, started a fortnightly publication named &quot;Saraj’ul Akhbar&quot;. &quot;Saraj&quot; was not the first such publication in the country, but in the field of journalism and literature it launched a new period of change and modernization. &quot;Saraj&quot; not only played an important role in journalism, it also gave new life to literature as a whole and opened the way for poetry to explore new avenues of expression through which personal thoughts took on a more social colour.

In 1930 (1309 AH), after months of cultural stagnation, a group of writers founded the Herat Literary Circle. A year later, another group calling itself the Kabul Literary Circle was founded in the capital. Both groups published regular magazines dedicated to culture and Persian literature. Both, especially the Kabul publication, had little success in becoming venues for modern Persian poetry and writing. In time, the Kabul publication turned into a stronghold for traditional writers and poets, and modernism in Dari literature was pushed to the fringes of social and cultural life.

Two of the most prominent classical poets in Afghanistan at the time were Abdul Haq Betab and Khalil Ullah Khalili. Betab received the honorary title &quot;Malek ul Shoara&quot; (King of Poets). Khalili was drawn toward the &quot;Khorasan style&quot; of poetry instead of the usual &quot;Hendi style&quot;. He was also interested in modern poetry and wrote a few poems in a more modern style with new aspects of thought and meaning. In 1318 (AH), after two poems by Nima Youshij titled &quot;Gharab&quot; and &quot;Ghoghnus&quot; were published, Khalili wrote a poem under the name &quot;Sorude Kuhestan&quot; or &quot;The Song of the Mountain&quot; in the same rhyming pattern as Nima and sent it to the Kabul Literary Circle. The traditionalists in Kabul refused to publish it because it was not written in the traditional rhyme. They criticized Khalili for modernizing his style.

Very gradually new styles found their way into literature and literary circles despite the efforts of traditionalists. The first book of new poems was published in the year 1957 (1336 AH), and in 1962 (1341 AH), a collection of modern Persian (Dari) poetry was published in Kabul. The first group to write poems in the new style consisted of Mahmud Farani, Baregh Shafi’i, Solayman Layeq, Sohail, Ayeneh and a few others. Later, Vasef Bakhtari, Asadullah Habib and Latif Nazemi, and others joined the group. Each had his own share in modernizing Persian poetry in Afghanistan. Other notable figures include Leila Sarahat Roshani, Sayed Elan Bahar, Parwin Pazwak, and Qahar Asi. Poets like Mayakovsky, Yase Nien and Lahouti (an Iranian poet living in exile in Russia) exerted a special influence on the Persian poets in Afghanistan. The influence of Iranians (e.g. Farrokhi Yazdi and Ahmad Shamlou) on the newly established Afghan prose and poetry, especially in the second half of the 20th century, must also be taken into consideration.

Prominent novelists and short story writers from Afghanistan include Akram Osman, known especially for &quot;Real Men Keep Their Word&quot; (مرداره قول اس), written in part in Kabuli dialect, and Rahnaward Zaryab. Some prominent writers from Afghanistan like Asef Soltanzadeh, Reza Ebrahimi, Ameneh Mohammadi, and Abbas Jafari grew up in Iran and were influenced by Iranian writers and teachers.

=== In Tajikistan ===
The new poetry in Tajikistan is mostly concerned with the way of life of people and is revolutionary. From the 1950s until the advent of new poetry in France, Asia and Latin America, the impact of the modernization drive was strong. In the 1960s, modern Iranian poetry and that of Mohammad Iqbal Lahouri made a profound impression in Tajik poetry. This period is probably the richest and most prolific period for the development of themes and forms in Persian poetry in Tajikistan. Some Tajik poets were mere imitators, and one can easily see the traits of foreign poets in their work. Only two or three poets were able to digest the foreign poetry and compose original poetry. In Tajikistan, the format and pictorial aspects of short stories and novels were taken from Russian and other European literature. Some of Tajikistan&#x27;s prominent names in Persian literature are Golrokhsar Safi Eva, Mo&#x27;men Ghena&#x27;at, Farzaneh Khojandi, Bozor Sobir, and Layeq Shir-Ali.

=== Literary criticism ===
Pioneers of Persian literary criticism in 19th century include Mirza Fath `Ali Akhundzade, Mirza Malkom Khan, Mirza `Abd al-Rahim Talebof and Zeyn al-`Abedin Maraghe`i.

Prominent 20th century critics include:

* Jamshid Behnam
* Allameh Dehkhoda
* Badiozzaman Forouzanfar
* Mohammad-Taqi Bahar
* Jalal Homaei
* Mohammad Moin
* Saeed Nafisi
* Parviz Natel-Khanlari
* Sadeq Hedayat
* Ahmad Kasravi.
* Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub
* Shahrokh Meskoob
*Ali Abdolrezaei

Saeed Nafisi analyzed and edited several critical works. He is well known for his works on Rudaki and Sufi literature. Parviz Natel-Khanlari and Gholamhossein Yousefi, who belong to Nafisi&#x27;s generation, were also involved in modern literature and critical writings. Natel-Khanlari is distinguished by the simplicity of his style. He did not follow the traditionalists, nor did he advocate the new. Instead, his approach accommodated the entire spectrum of creativity and expression in Persian literature. Another critic, Ahmad Kasravi, an experienced authority on literature, attacked the writers and poets whose works served despotism.

Contemporary Persian literary criticism reached its maturity after Sadeq Hedayat, Ebrahim Golestan, Houshang Golshiri, Abdolhossein Zarrinkoub and Shahrokh Meskoob. Among these figures, Zarrinkoub held academic positions and had a reputation not only among the intelligentsia but also in academia. Besides his significant contribution to the maturity of Persian language and literature, Zarrinkoub boosted comparative literature and Persian literary criticism. Zarrinkoub&#x27;s &quot;Serr e Ney&quot; is a critical and comparative analysis of Rumi&#x27;s &quot;Masnavi&quot;. In turn, Shahrokh Meskoob worked on Ferdowsi&#x27;s &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, using the principles of modern literary criticism.

Mohammad Taghi Bahar&#x27;s main contribution to this field is his book called &quot;Sabk Shenasi&quot; (Stylistics). It is a pioneering work on the practice of Persian literary historiography and the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the 20th century. It contends that the exemplary status of Sabk-shinasi rests on the recognition of its disciplinary or institutional achievements. It further contends that, rather than a text on Persian ‘stylistics’, Sabk-shinasi is a vast history of Persian literary prose, and, as such, is a significant intervention in Persian literary historiography.

Jalal Homaei, Badiozzaman Forouzanfar and his student, Mohammad Reza Shafiei-Kadkani, are other notable figures who have edited a number of prominent literary works.

Critical analysis of Jami&#x27;s works has been carried out by Ala Khan Afsahzad. His classic book won the prestigious award of Iran&#x27;s Year Best book in the year 2000.

=== Persian short stories ===

Historically, the modern Persian short story has undergone three stages of development: a formative period, a period of consolidation and growth, and a period of diversity.

==== Period of diversity ====
In this period, the influence of the western literature on the Iranian writers and authors is obvious. The new and modern approaches to writing is introduced and several genres have developed specially in the field of short story. The most popular trends are toward post-modern methods and speculative fiction.

=== Poetry ===
Notable Persian poets, modern and classical, include Mehdi Akhavan-Sales, Simin Behbahani, Forough Farrokhzad, Mohammad Zohari, Bijan Jalali, Mina Assadi, Siavash Kasraie, Fereydoon Moshiri, Nader Naderpour, Sohrab Sepehri, Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani, Ahmad Shamlou, Nima Yushij, Houshang Ebtehaj, Mirzadeh Eshghi (classical), Mohammad Taghi Bahar (classical), Aref Ghazvini (classical), Ahmad NikTalab (new classic), Parvin Etesami (classical), Shahriar (classical) and, Ali Abdolrezaei (Post Modernism and New Post Modernism), Babak NikTalab (Children&#x27;s poetry).

==== Classical Persian poetry in modern times ====
A few notable classical poets have arisen since the 19th century, among whom Mohammad Taghi Bahar and Parvin Etesami have been most celebrated. Mohammad Taghi Bahar had the title &quot;king of poets&quot; and had a significant role in the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution in the early part of the 20th century. The theme of his poems was the social and political situation of Iran.

Parvin Etesami may be called the greatest Persian woman poet writing in the classical style. One of her remarkable series, called &quot;Mast va Hoshyar&quot; (The Drunk and the Sober), won admiration from many of those involved in romantic poetry.

==== Modern Persian poetry ====
Nima Yushij is considered the father of modern Persian poetry, introducing many techniques and forms to differentiate the modern from the old. Nevertheless, the credit for popularizing this new literary form within a country and culture solidly based on a thousand years of classical poetry goes to his few disciples such as Ahmad Shamlou, who adopted Nima&#x27;s methods and tried new techniques of modern poetry.

The transformation brought about by Nima Youshij, who freed Persian poetry from the fetters of prosodic measures, was a turning point in a long literary tradition. It broadened the perception and thinking of the poets that came after him. Nima offered a different understanding of the principles of classical poetry. His artistry was not confined to removing the need for a fixed-length hemistich and dispensing with the tradition of rhyming but focused on a broader structure and function based on a contemporary understanding of human and social existence. His aim in renovating poetry was to commit it to a &quot;natural identity&quot; and to achieve a modern discipline in the mind and linguistic performance of the poet.

Nima held that the formal technique dominating classical poetry interfered with its vitality, vigor and progress. Although he accepted some of its aesthetic properties and extended them in his poetry, he never ceased to widen his poetic experience by emphasizing the &quot;natural order&quot; of this art. What Nima Youshij founded in contemporary poetry, his successor Ahmad Shamlou continued.

The Sepid poem (which translates to white poem), which draws its sources from this poet, avoided the compulsory rules which had entered the Nimai’ school of poetry and adopted a freer structure. This allowed a more direct relationship between the poet and his or her emotional roots. In previous poetry, the qualities of the poet’s vision as well as the span of the subject could only be expressed in general terms and were subsumed by the formal limitations imposed on poetic expression.

Nima’s poetry transgressed these limitations. It relied on the natural function inherent within poetry itself to portray the poet’s solidarity with life and the wide world surrounding him or her in specific and unambiguous details and scenes. Sepid poetry continues the poetic vision as Nima expressed it and avoids the contrived rules imposed on its creation. However, its most distinct difference with Nimai’ poetry is to move away from the rhythms it employed. Nima Youshij paid attention to an overall harmonious rhyming and created many experimental examples to achieve this end.

Ahmad Shamlu discovered the inner characteristics of poetry and its manifestation in the literary creations of classical masters as well as the Nimai’ experience. He offered an individual approach. By distancing himself from the obligations imposed by older poetry and some of the limitations that had entered the Nimai’ poem, he recognized the role of prose and music hidden in the language. In the structure of Sepid poetry, in contrast to the prosodic and Nimai’ rules, the poem is written in more &quot;natural&quot; words and incorporates a prose-like process without losing its poetic distinction.
Sepid poetry is a developing branch of Nimai’ poetry built upon Nima Youshij&#x27;s innovations. Nima thought that any change in the construction and the tools of a poet’s expression is conditional on his/her knowledge of the world and a revolutionized outlook. Sepid poetry could not take root outside this teaching and its application.

According to Simin Behbahani, Sepid poetry did not receive general acceptance before Bijan Jalali&#x27;s works. He is considered the founder of Sepid poetry according to Behbahani.
Behbahani herself used the &quot;Char Pareh&quot; style of Nima, and subsequently turned to ghazal, a free-flowing poetry style similar to the Western sonnet. Simin Behbahani contributed to a historic development in the form of the ghazal, as she added theatrical subjects, and daily events and conversations into her poetry. She has expanded the range of traditional Persian verse forms and produced some of the most significant works of Persian literature in the 20th century.

A reluctant follower of Nima Yushij, Mehdi Akhavan-Sales published his &quot;Organ&quot; (1951) to support contentions against Nima Yushij&#x27;s groundbreaking endeavors. In Persian poetry, Mehdi Akhavan Sales has established a bridge between the &quot;Khorassani&quot; and &quot;Nima&quot; Schools. The critics consider Mehdi Akhavan Sales as one of the best contemporary Persian poets. He is one of the pioneers of free verse (new style poetry) in Persian literature, particularly of modern style epics. It was his ambition, for a long time, to introduce a fresh style to Persian poetry.

Forough Farrokhzad is important in the literary history of Iran for three reasons. First, she was among the first generation to embrace the new style of poetry, pioneered by Nima Yushij during the 1920s, which demanded that poets experiment with rhyme, imagery, and the individual voice. Second, she was the first modern Iranian woman to graphically articulate private sexual landscapes from a woman&#x27;s perspective. Finally, she transcended her own literary role and experimented with acting, painting, and documentary film-making.

Fereydoon Moshiri is best known as conciliator of classical Persian poetry with the New Poetry initiated by Nima Yooshij. One of the major contributions of Moshiri&#x27;s poetry, according to some observers, is the broadening of the social and geographical scope of modern Persian literature.

A poet of the last generation before the Islamic Revolution worthy of mention is Mohammad-Reza Shafiei-Kadkani (M. Sereshk). Though he is from Khorassan and sways between allegiance to Nima Youshij and Akhavan Saless, in his poetry he shows the influences of Hafiz and Mowlavi. He uses simple, lyrical language and is mostly inspired by the political atmosphere. He is the most successful of those poets who in the past four decades have tried hard to find a synthesis between the two models of Ahmad Shamloo and Nima Youshij.

In the twenty-first century, a new generation of Iranian poets continues to work in the New Poetry style and now attracts an international audience thanks to efforts to translate their works. Éditions Bruno Doucey published a selection of forty-eight poems by Garus Abdolmalekian entitled &quot;Our Fists under the Table&quot; (2012), translated into French by Farideh Rava. Other notable names are poet and publisher Babak Abazari (1984–2015), who died under mysterious circumstances in January 2015, and emerging young poet Milad Khanmirzaei.

Post Modern Persian poetry

In 1990s a progressive evolution called Postmodern Ghazal begun in the Persian poetry leading to the modern poetry that changed the balancing principle of rhythm and rhyme of the traditional Persian poetry, as did in the Free Verse poetry following the rhythm of natural speech. Now, the center of the attention was language alone, and not only rhythm was absent but the charm of language leads it to be the main axle pushing the Persian poetry forward. The three most talked about poets of the Post Modern Poetry in Iran are Reza Barahani, Ali Abdolrezaei and Ali Babachahi. Among them Ali Abdolrezaei enjoyed a wider admissibility due to the new language he expressed which prevailed in that period. Of these poets Reza Barahani’s “Butterflies” (or Addressed to Butterflies), Ali Abdolrezaei’s “Paris in Renault”, “So Sermon of Society”, “Shinema” and “Mothurt”, and Ali Babachahi’s “The Soft Rain is Me” belong to this genre.

===== Children&#x27;s poetry =====
In the contemporary period, the growth and manifestation of children&#x27;s poetry in Persian language and literature increased and in this period we see the emergence of prominent poets such as Mahmoud Kianoosh and Abbas Yamini Sharif in young poetry and Babak Niktalab in adolescent poetry.

<text>Andrey Yanuaryevich Vyshinsky (; ) ( – 22 November 1954) was a Soviet politician, jurist and diplomat.

He is best known as a state prosecutor of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Moscow Trials and in the Nuremberg trials. He was the Soviet Foreign Minister from 1949 to 1953, after having served as Deputy Foreign Minister under Vyacheslav Molotov since 1940. He also headed the Institute of State and Law in the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Vyshinsky was born in Odessa into a Polish Catholic family, which later moved to Baku. Early biographies portray his father, Yanuary Vyshinsky (Januarius Wyszyński), as a &quot;well-prospering&quot; &quot;experienced inspector&quot; (Russian: Ревизор); while later, undocumented, Stalin-era biographies such as that in the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; make him a pharmaceutical chemist. A talented student, Andrei Vyshinsky married Kara Mikhailova and became interested in revolutionary ideas. He began attending the Kiev University in 1901, but was expelled in 1902 for participating in revolutionary activities.

Vyshinsky returned to Baku, became a member of the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1903 and took an active part in the 1905 Russian Revolution. As a result, in 1908 he was sentenced to prison and a few days later was sent to in Baku to serve his sentence. Here he first met Stalin: a fellow-inmate with whom he engaged in ideological disputes. After his release, he returned home to Baku for the birth of his daughter Zinaida in 1909. Soon thereafter, he returned to Kiev University and did quite well, graduating in 1913. He was even considered for a professorship, but his political past caught up with him, and he was forced to return to Baku.
Determined to practise law, he tried Moscow, where he became a successful lawyer, remained an active Menshevik, gave many passionate and incendiary speeches, and became involved in city government.

===Russian Revolution and Civil War===
After the February Revolution in 1917, he was appointed police commissioner of the Yakimanka District. As a minor official, he undersigned an order to arrest Vladimir Lenin on charges of being a &quot;German spy&quot;, according to the decision of the Minister of Justice of the Russian Provisional Government, but the October Revolution quickly intervened, and the offices which had ordered the arrest were dissolved. In 1917, he became reacquainted with Stalin, who had become an important Bolshevik leader. Consequently, he joined the staff of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Food, which was responsible for Moscow&#x27;s food supplies, and with the help of Stalin, Alexei Rykov, and Lev Kamenev, he began to rise in influence and prestige. In 1920, after the defeat of the Whites under Denikin, and the end of the Russian Civil War, he joined the Bolsheviks.

===Bolsheviks in power===

Becoming a member of the nomenklatura he became a prosecutor in the new Soviet legal system, began a rivalry with a fellow lawyer, Nikolai Krylenko, and in 1925 was elected rector of Moscow University, which he began to clear of &quot;unsuitable&quot; students and professors.

In 1928, he presided over the Shakhty Trial against 53 alleged counter-revolutionary &quot;wreckers&quot;. Krylenko acted as prosecutor, and the outcome was never in doubt. As historian Arkady Vaksberg explains, &quot;all the court&#x27;s attention was concentrated not on analyzing the evidence, which simply did not exist, but on securing from the accused confirmation of their confessions of guilt that were contained in the records of the preliminary investigation.&quot;

In November–December 1930, he presided as judge over the Industrial Party Trial, with Krylenko as prosecutor, which was accompanied by a storm of international protest. In this case, all eight defendants confessed their guilt. As a result, he was promoted. In April 1933, he was prosecutor in the Metro-Vickers trial, at which eight out of 18 defendants were British engineers, and which resulted in relatively light sentences.

He carried out administrative preparations for a &quot;systematic&quot; drive &quot;against harvest-wreckers and grain-thieves&quot;.

===Procurator General and Soviet law theorist===
Vyshinsky was appointed First Deputy Procurator General of the Soviet Union when the office was first created on 30 June 1933. At this time, he outranked Krylenko but was nominally junior to Ivan Akulov. In January 1935, he prosecuted Grigory Zinoviev and 18 other former supporters of the Left Opposition, who were accused of &#x27;moral responsibility&#x27; for the assassination of Sergei Kirov.

In June 1935, Vyshinsky replaced Akulov, who had allegedly questioned the decision to link Zinoviev and others to the Kirov murder, and from thereon he was the legal mastermind of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge. Although he acted as a judge, he encouraged investigators to procure confessions from the accused. In some cases, he prepared the indictments before the &quot;investigation&quot; was concluded. In his &quot;Theory of Judicial Proofs in Soviet Justice&quot; (Stalin Prize in 1947) he laid a theoretical base for the Soviet judicial system. He also used his own speeches from the Moscow Trials as an example of how defendants&#x27; statements could be used as primary evidence. Vyshinsky is cited for the principle that &quot;confession of the accused is the queen of evidence&quot;.

Vyshinsky first became a nationally known public figure as a result of the Semenchuk case of 1936. Konstantin Semenchuk was the head of the Glavsevmorput station on Wrangel Island. He was accused of oppressing and starving the local Yupik and of ordering his subordinate, the sledge driver Stepan Startsev, to murder Dr. Nikolai Vulfson, who had attempted to stand up to Semenchuk, on 27 December 1934 (though there were also rumors that Startsev had fallen in love with Vulfson&#x27;s wife, Dr. Gita Feldman, and killed him out of jealousy). The case came to trial before the Supreme Court of the RSFSR in May 1936; both defendants, attacked by Vyshinsky as &quot;human waste&quot;, were found guilty and shot, and &quot;the most publicised result of the trial was the joy of the liberated Eskimos.&quot;

In 1936, Vyshinsky achieved international infamy as the prosecutor at the Zinoviev-Kamenev trial (this trial had nine other defendants), the first of the Moscow Trials during the Great Purge, lashing its defenseless victims with vituperative rhetoric:

He often punctuated speeches with phrases like &quot;Dogs of the Fascist bourgeoisie&quot;, &quot;mad dogs of Trotskyism&quot;, &quot;dregs of society&quot;, &quot;decayed people&quot;, &quot;terrorist thugs and degenerates&quot;, and &quot;accursed vermin&quot;. This dehumanization aided in what historian Arkady Vaksberg calls &quot;a hitherto unknown type of trial where there was not the slightest need for evidence: what evidence did you need when you were dealing with &#x27;stinking carrion&#x27; and &#x27;mad dogs&#x27;?&quot;

He is also attributed by some as the author of an infamous quote from the Stalin era: &quot;Give me a man and I will find the crime.&quot;

During the trials, Vyshinsky misappropriated the house and money of Leonid Serebryakov (one of the defendants of the infamous Moscow Trials), who was later executed.

In April 1937, Vyshinsky denounced Yevgeny Pashukanis, the Soviet Union&#x27;s foremost legal scholar and former Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Justice as a &#x27;wrecker&#x27;. This was the start of a purge of prosecutor&#x27;s apparatus, carried out by Vyshinsky, which saw 90 per cent of provincial prosecutors removed, and many of them arrested. Pashukanis was executed later that year.

During the Great Purge, Vyshinsky was approached in his office by Mikhail Ishov, a military procurator based in West Siberia, who had been trying to stop the arrests of innocent people in that territory. Vyshinsky told him: &quot;You have lost your sense of party and class. We don&#x27;t intend to pat enemies on the head. [...] If the enemy doesn&#x27;t surrender, he must be destroyed.&quot; After the meeting, he reported Ishov, who was arrested and sentenced to five years in labour camps.

Roland Freisler, a German Nazi judge, who served as the State Secretary of the Reich Ministry of Justice, studied and had attended the trials by Vyshinsky&#x27;s in 1938 to use a similar approach in show trials conducted by Nazi Germany.

In May 1939, Vyshinsky was promoted to the rank of Deputy Chairman of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars Ministers (ie deputy prime minister) of the Soviet Union. His sphere of responsibilities included education and culture, as these areas were incorporated more fully into the USSR, he directed efforts to convert the written alphabets of conquered peoples to the Cyrillic alphabet., as well as the law.

In June 1939, he presided over the All-Union Conference of Stage Directors. The fourth speaker in the main debate, on 15 June, was Vsevolod Meyerhold, the Soviet Union&#x27;s most renowned living stage director. His speech was not reported in the Soviet press, except to say that it was severely criticised. Meyerhold was arrested five days later, tortured, and shot.

===Wartime diplomat===
In June 1937, Vyshinsky took part in negotiations with the US Ambassador in Moscow, Joseph E. Davies, over trade debts, and after the completion of the last of the major show trials, in March 1938, he entered another phase in his career, devoted primarily to foreign affairs. Vyshinsky had a low opinion of diplomats because they often complained about the effect of trials on opinions in the West. The Great Purge inflicted tremendous losses on the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. Maxim Litvinov was one of the few diplomats who survived and he was dismissed in 1939, and replaced by Vyacheslav Molotov. 
In 1939, Vyshinsky introduced a motion to the Supreme Soviet to bring the Western Ukraine into the USSR. In June to August 1940 he was sent to Latvia to supervise the establishment of a pro-Soviet government and incorporation of that country into the USSR. He was generally well received, and he set out to purge the Latvian Communist Party of Trotskyists, Bukharinites, and possible foreign agents. In July 1940, a Latvian Soviet Republic was proclaimed. It was, unsurprisingly, granted admission to the USSR.

As a result of this success, on 6 September 1940, he was named First Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar of Foreign Affairs, and taken into greater confidence by Stalin, Lavrentiy Beria, and Vyacheslav Molotov. His main responsibility was Eastern Europe, though he was the official that Stafford Cripps dealt with during his period as British Ambassador, and the one to whom Cripps passed on Winston Churchill&#x27;s warning that Germany might be intending to invade the USSR, which Vyshinsky refused to discuss.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union Vyshinsky was transferred to the shadow capital at Kuibyshev. He remained here for much of the war, but he continued to act as a loyal functionary, and attempted to ingratiate himself with Archibald Clark Kerr and visiting Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie. During the Tehran Conference in 1943, he remained in the Soviet Union to &quot;keep shop&quot; while most of the leadership was abroad. Stalin appointed him to the Allied Control Council on Italian affairs where he began organizing the repatriation of Soviet POWs (including those who did not want to return to the Soviet Union). He also began to liaise with the Italian Communist Party in Naples.
In February 1945, he accompanied Stalin, Molotov, and Beria to the Yalta Conference. After returning to Moscow he was dispatched to Romania, where he arranged for a communist regime to assume control in 1945. He then once again accompanied the Soviet leadership to the Potsdam Conference. On 26 February 1946, he rushed to Bucharest to force King Michael of Romania, whose palace was surrounded by Soviet tanks, to dismiss the anti-communist head of government, General Nicolae Rădescu and appoint the pro-communist Petru Groza.

British diplomat Sir Frank Roberts, who served as British chargé d&#x27;affaires in Moscow from February 1945 to October 1947, described him as follows:
===Post-Second World War===

He was responsible for the Soviet preparations for the trial of the major German war criminals by the International Military Tribunal.

In 1953, he was among the chief figures accused by the U.S. Congress Kersten Committee during its investigation of the Soviet occupation of the Baltic states.

The positions he held included those of vice-premier (1939–1944), Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (1940–1949), Minister of Foreign Affairs (1949–1953), academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union from 1939, and permanent representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations.

===Death===
Vyshinsky died on 22 November 1954 in New York City. His body was returned to Moscow by a special flight, and his ashes buried at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

==Scholarship==
Vyshinsky was the director of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Institute of State and Law. Until the period of de-Stalinization, the Institute of State and Law was named in his honor.

During his tenure as director of the ISL, Vyshinsky oversaw the publication of several important monographs on the general theory of state and law.

==Family==
Vyshinsky married Kapitolina Isidorovna Mikhailova and had a daughter named Zinaida Andreyevna Vyshinskaya (born 1909).

==Awards and decorations==
* Six Orders of Lenin (1937, 1943, 1945, 1947, 1954)
* Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1933)
* Medal &quot;For the Defence of Moscow&quot; (1944)
* Medal &quot;For Valiant Labour in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945&quot; (1945).
* Stalin Prize, first class (1947; for the monograph &quot;Theory of forensic evidence in Soviet law&quot;)

==Cultural references==
The Pet Shop Boys song &quot;This Must Be the Place I Waited Years to Leave&quot; from the album &quot;Behaviour&quot; (1990) contains a sample of recording from Vyshinsky&#x27;s speech at the Zinoviev-Kamenev trial of 1936.

Vyshinsky appears at the beginning of the 2016 novel &quot;A Gentleman in Moscow&quot; by Amor Towles as the prosecutor in a purported transcript of an appearance by Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov, the novel&#x27;s gentleman protagonist, before the Emergency Committee of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs on 21 June 1922.

In Gregor Martov&#x27;s alternative history novel &quot;His New Majesty&quot;, depicting an alternate history in which Anton Denikin&#x27;s White forces defeated the Bolsheviks in 1921, Vyshinsky joins the winners and acts as the royal prosecutor in a show trial in which Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and Bukharin are sentenced to death as &quot;Subversives, Traitors, Blasphemers and Regicides&quot;. He is rewarded in being ennobled by the restored czar and made a duke, but gets assassinated by an anarchist girl with whom he had a secret affair.

The saying &quot;give me the man; there&#x27;ll be a paragraph for him&quot;, popular in Poland and referring to the miscarriage of justice under the communist regimes, has been attributed to him.

<text>Derek Anthony Hatton (born 17 January 1948) is a British former politician, later a broadcaster, property developer and businessman. He gained national prominence as deputy leader of Liverpool City Council in the 1980s and was a member of the Trotskyist Militant group.

==Early life==
Hatton attended the Liverpool Institute for Boys from 1959 to 1964. Notable names at the school included Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Peter Sissons, Bill Kenwright and Steven Norris. His subsequent academic success was limited, but he enjoyed sports and appeared on stage as Gratiano in a school production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; with future theatre producer Bill Kenwright.

==Political career==
Hatton became a firefighter and later joined the Labour Party and Militant, a Trotskyist organisation then following an entryist strategy within the Labour Party. As deputy leader of Liverpool City Council from 1983, Hatton was the most vocal and prominent member of the council&#x27;s leadership. The then Leader of the Council was John Hamilton, a soft-spoken and widely admired local politician.

Hatton joined the rate-capping rebellion in 1985 as the council refused to make a rate increase. In June, the council changed tactics and set an illegal &quot;deficit budget&quot; which committed it to spending £30 million more than its income, claiming that the excess represented grant &quot;stolen&quot; by central government. Once adopted by the Liverpool District Labour Party and 49 councillors, this policy catapulted Hatton and the city council into massive media attention and conflict with the then Conservative government. In 1986, Hatton and 46 other councillors were subsequently found to have committed wilful misconduct by the district auditor, ordered to repay the costs incurred by the council due to the failure to set a rate as a surcharge, and disqualified from office.

Hatton was expelled from the Labour Party in 1986 for belonging to Militant, which had earlier been found to be in breach of the Labour Party&#x27;s constitution. Hatton argued that Militant was a legitimate Marxist tendency within the Labour Party, but the National Executive Committee voted to expel him by twelve votes to six.

In 1993, Hatton was accused of corruption as deputy leader of Liverpool City Council. After a lengthy trial, at Mold Crown Court, he was found not guilty.

Hatton, along with others, believes that he was the inspiration behind the character of Michael Murray in the G.B.H. series aired by Channel Four.

==Media career==
Hatton presented the lunchtime phone-in on 105.4 Century FM when it launched in 1998, titled &quot;The Degsy Debate&quot;. The BBC Two fly-on-the-wall documentary &quot;Trouble at the Top&quot; followed the station&#x27;s launch, and Hatton&#x27;s training. In the 1990s, he worked as Talk Radio&#x27;s morning phone-in presenter. He was the subject of a BBC documentary, &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; in 1996.

In the 1990s, Hatton starred in a series of adverts for Sekonda watches. He also appeared on an episode of BBC panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; in 1993, alongside Conservative MP and panellist Edwina Currie, also a Liverpudlian.

In 2010, Hatton appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Alternative Election Night Special&quot; episode of &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; alongside Brian Paddick, Edwina Currie and Rod Liddle. 

Hatton was a director of Rippleffect Studios Limited from 1999 to 2008

==Rejoining the Labour Party==
It was reported in the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; in 2007 that Hatton had rejoined the Labour Party and intended to seek selection as a prospective parliamentary candidate in the North West. Hatton made clear that he is no longer a Trotskyist, but maintains that he remains firmly on the left of the party, expressing his belief that Labour has to abandon New Labour ideology (or &quot;neo-Tory&quot;, as Hatton puts it) and return to its traditional values.

In October 2008, during an interview with &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Hatton revealed that he had become a capitalist running a property company in Cyprus and driving a £60,000 Range Rover, justifying his change in attitude as &quot;My days in politics were a very long time ago and I lost interest in it after I was expelled from the city council&quot;. Hatton gave another interview in the same year to the &quot;Liverpool Daily Post&quot; in which he reasserted his intention to seek selection as a parliamentary Labour candidate for a constituency in Liverpool or elsewhere in the North West at some point in the future. Hatton stated that he may challenge &quot;one of the neo-Tory types currently representing Liverpool, like Maria Eagle maybe&quot;.

===2015 rejected application===
On 28 May 2015, it emerged that Hatton had attempted to rejoin the Labour Party on 9 May, two days after Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 2015 general election. His application was rejected by Iain McNicol, the party&#x27;s general secretary.

In September 2015, Hatton endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He wrote: &quot;For the first time since the Eighties we have a clear choice between a Tory party supported by big business, and a Labour party based on the trade unions. This might sound very old fashioned, but it&#x27;s simply a return to the obvious split that has always existed. It was artificially camouflaged under New Labour. It&#x27;s an exciting time for the whole country, but I fear that the pressure which will be brought to bear from the &#x27;New Labour dinosaurs&#x27; and from much of the media will be massive, and Jeremy Corbyn will need strength and support in abundance in order to resist it.&quot;

In a BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; broadcast on 27 July 2015 Hatton claimed not to be a property developer, and that he was a card-carrying member of the Labour Party. He supported the campaign of Jeremy Corbyn to lead the Labour Party. However, the Labour Party denied this, insisting instead that Hatton had been sent a membership card automatically but had not been permitted to join.

At the end of January 2017, in an article for the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;, Hatton wrote that he had voted against Britain leaving the European Union in the membership referendum in June 2016: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe Corbyn is arguing for Labour MPs to vote with the most reactionary and xenophobic Tory government we&#x27;ve seen for a long time. This shows a real lack of leadership on his part and does now make me have serious doubts about him&quot;.

===2018 overturned successful application===
Hatton applied to rejoin Labour in September 2018. The application was approved in February 2019. He was suspended from the party on 20 February, just days after he was re-admitted, after an allegedly anti-Semitic tweet from 2012 came to light.

==2020 arrest==

In December 2020, newspapers reported that Hatton was one of five men, including the Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, arrested as part of an investigation into building and development contracts in Liverpool.

<doc id="462490" wikidata="Q7538723" url="?curid=462490" title="Slapjack">
<text>Slapjack, also known as Slaps, is a card game generally played among children. It can often be a child&#x27;s first introduction to playing cards.
The game is a cross between Beggar-My-Neighbour and Egyptian Ratscrew and is also sometimes known as &quot;Heart Attack&quot;. It is also related to the simpler &#x27;slap&#x27; card games often called Snap.

==Gameplay==

A 52-card deck is divided into face-down stacks as equally as possible between all players. One player removes the top card of their stack and places it face-up on the playing surface within reach of all players. The players take turns doing this in a clockwise manner until a jack is placed on the pile. At this point, any and all players may attempt to slap the pile with the hand they didn&#x27;t use to place the card; the first player to cover the stack with their hand takes the pile, shuffles it, and adds it to the bottom of their stack. If another player puts their card over the jack before it is slapped, the jack and the cards underneath can&#x27;t be taken by a player until the next jack is revealed. When a player has run out of cards, they have one more chance to slap a jack and get back in the game, but if they fail, they are out. Gameplay continues with hands of this sort until one player has acquired all of the cards.

In a popular variation with a regular deck, the person covering the cards must simultaneously say &quot;Slapjack!&quot; If the person fails to say this, they do not get the pile. Additionally, if the player covers the pile and says &quot;Slapjack&quot;, and the card is not a jack, then the other players get to divide the pile evenly among themselves.

==Variations==

===Snap===
Snap is a popular children&#x27;s card game where cards are dealt out and the object is to react first when a pair of same-value cards are revealed. Gameplay is related to Egyptian Ratscrew. The game is often one of the first card games to be taught to children and is often played with special packs of cards featuring popular children&#x27;s characters from television programmes or recent films. For older children, more complex packs exist, where the differences between cards are more subtle and penalties exist for falsely calling &quot;Snap&quot;.

The pack of cards is dealt out among the players in face-down stacks as equally as possible. Play proceeds with the players taking it in turns to remove a card from the top of their stack and place it face-up on a pile in front of them. If two cards on the tops of any of these piles are ever identical (or, if a conventional pack of cards is used, are of the same number), the first player to shout &quot;Snap!&quot; takes both face-up piles and adds them to the bottom of their own stack. The player who accumulates all the cards wins.

In a variation, better suited to younger children, cards are played onto a single shared stack, and players call &quot;snap!&quot; if two consecutive cards on this pile are identical.

===Cabin 6===
This variation is played with a traditional deck of cards and complications are added as to appeal to a slightly older demographic. 

A standard 54 (including jokers) deck of cards is dealt face down to the players. Simultaneously, all players turn over their top card. If any two cards show the same number, OR a joker is played by any player, the first player to cry out (traditionally the word &#x27;snap&#x27; but any cry will do) receives all of the cards played. If none is played, players turn over the next card in their deck. When a player runs out of cards, they have until the end of the trick AND the next trick to attempt to win themselves cards. After this they are eliminated. Eliminated players act as judges as to who cries out first. The player with all of the cards at the end wins.

===Irish Snap===
Irish Snap is a card game whose objective is to lose cards as quickly as possible. Since there is only one loser, can be made for the person with all the cards at the end of the game.

A deck of card is dealt out to the players, face down. They take turns to play cards face-up to a centre pile, calling out card ranks as they do so: the first player calls &quot;Ace&quot;, the second &quot;two&quot;, and so on. If the card you play matches the card you have called, the pile can be slapped as in Slapjack, with the last person to slap taking the pile as a penalty. The last player to have any cards left is the loser.

====Alternative rules====

Other commonly accepted rules include:
*If the card laid is identical in rank to the one beneath it, all players snap.
*If the card laid is a queen, all players snap.
*If a seven (or another rank of card agreed upon by all players) is laid, the ranks are no longer counted out loud and players must keep track of them in their head. This may continue until the same card is laid again and nullifies the rule.
*Players snap a set of cards which increase or decrease by one rank every card. For example: 5,6,7 or 8,7,6.
*Players snap &quot;sandwiches&quot;, two matching cards with any card in between them, such as 5,7,5 or Jack,3,Jack.
*Players must salute before making a snap which will land on a king
*When a player runs out of cards, they continue to call numbers. However, any potential snaps this causes may be snapped before they have said the relevant card rank. This is particularly interesting when neighboring players run out of cards simultaneously.
*If a player snaps incorrectly when there is not actually any kind of matching pair, they receive all of the cards. However, in order for this to come into effect the player must touch the deck in the middle. If they simply shout snap, or motion towards it, the game carries on as normal.
*Any player who snaps fastest twice in a row may add another rule.
*A player who runs out of cards and snaps fastest is declared the winner.

Irish Snap can also be played as a drinking game, where a player must also take a drink when they take the pile of cards.

<text>Kiska (, ) is one of the Rat Islands, a group of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. It is about long and varies in width from . It is part of Aleutian Islands Wilderness and as such, special permission is required to visit it. The island has no permanent population.

== History ==

=== European discovery (1741) ===

In 1741 while returning from his second voyage at sea during the Great Northern Expedition, Danish-born Russian explorer Vitus Bering made the first European discovery of most of the Aleutian Islands, including Kiska. Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist-physician aboard Bering&#x27;s ship, wrote:

On 25 October 1741 we had very clear weather and sunshine, but even so it hailed at various times in the afternoon. We were surprised in the morning to discover a large tall island at 51° to the north of us.

Prior to European contact, Kiska Island had been densely populated by native peoples for thousands of years.

=== After discovery (1741–1939) ===
Kiska, and the other Rat Islands, were reached by independent Russian traders in the 1750s. After the initial exploitation of the sea otter population, Russians rarely visited the island as interest shifted further east. Years would frequently pass without a single ship landing.

Starting in 1775, Kiska, the Aleutian Islands, and mainland Alaska became fur trading outposts for the Russian-American Company managed by Grigory Shelekhov.

In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward negotiated the purchase of Alaska with the Russian Empire. Kiska was included in the purchase.

=== World War II (1939–1945) ===


The Japanese No. 3 Special Landing Party and 500 marines went ashore at Kiska on June 6, 1942, as a separate campaign concurrent with the Japanese plan for the Battle of Midway. The Japanese captured the sole inhabitants of the island: a small United States Navy Weather Detachment consisting of ten men, including a lieutenant, along with their dog. (One member of the detachment escaped for 50 days. Starving, thin, and extremely cold, he eventually surrendered to the Japanese.) The next day the Japanese captured Attu Island.

The military importance of this frozen, difficult-to-supply island was questionable, but the psychological impact upon the Americans of losing U.S. soil to a foreign enemy for the first time since the War of 1812 was tangible. During the winter of 1942–43, the Japanese reinforced and fortified the islands—not necessarily to prepare for an island-hopping operation across the Aleutians, but to prevent a U.S. operation across the Kuril Islands. The U.S. Navy began operations to deny Kiska supply which would lead to the Battle of the Komandorski Islands. During October 1942, American forces undertook seven bombing missions over Kiska, though two were aborted due to weather. Following the winter, Attu was recaptured, and bombing of Kiska resumed until a larger American force was allocated to defeat the expected Japanese garrison of 5,200 men.

The Japanese, aware of the loss of Attu and the impending arrival of the larger Allied force, successfully removed their troops on July 28 under the cover of fog, without being detected by the Allies.

On August 15, 1943, an invasion force consisting of 34,426 Allied troops, including elements of the US 7th Infantry Division, 4th Infantry Regiment, 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, 5,300 Canadians (mainly the 13th Infantry Brigade from the 6th Canadian Infantry Division), with supporting units including two artillery units from the 7th US Infantry Division, 95 ships including three battleships and a heavy cruiser, and 168 aircraft landed on Kiska, only to find the island completely abandoned.

Despite the lack of Japanese presence, Allied casualties during this invasion nevertheless numbered close to 200, either from bad weather, Japanese booby traps or friendly fire. As a result of the brief &quot;friendly fire&quot; engagement between U.S. and Canadian forces, 28 Americans and four Canadians were killed. There were an additional 130 casualties from trench foot. The destroyer hit a mine, resulting in 87 casualties.

That night the Imperial Japanese Navy warships, thinking they were engaged by Americans, shelled and attempted to torpedo the island of Little Kiska where the Japanese soldiers were waiting to embark. Admiral Ernest King reported to the secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, that the only things that remained on the island were dogs and freshly brewed coffee. Knox asked for an explanation and King responded, &quot;The Japanese are very clever. Their dogs can brew coffee.&quot;

=== Since World War II ===

In 1985 the Japanese occupation site on the island was designated a National Historic Landmark and part of Aleutian Islands World War II National Monument. The island is also a part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge (AMNWR) and contains the largest colony of least auklets (over 1,160,000 birds) and crested auklets. Research biologists from Memorial University of Newfoundland have been studying the impact of introduced Norway rats on the seabirds of Kiska since 2001.

Much of the aftermath of World War II is still evident in Kiska. The slow erosion processes on the tundra have had little effect on the bomb craters still visible both from the ground and in satellite images on the hills surrounding the harbor. Numerous equipment dumps, tunnels (some concrete-lined), Japanese gun emplacements, shipwrecks, and other war relics can be found, all untouched since 1943.

In 1983, a memorial plaque was placed on Kiska by the 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment, inscribed:

To the men of Amphibious Task Force 9 who fell here August 1943 placed here August 1983 by 87th Mountain Infantry Regiment.

In September 1989, divers from the United States Navy rescue and salvage ship surveyed the wreck of the Imperial Japanese Navy submarine , which sank in the harbor at Kiska with the loss of 19 lives on November 3, 1942.

On August 22, 2007, the submarine , which disappeared with a crew of 70 during World War II, was found in of water off Kiska.

There were no alterations to the landscape since World War II including the traces of the war. Unexploded ammunition is scattered throughout the landscape.

=== In fiction ===

Renamed &quot;Skira&quot;, the island was used as the setting for the Codemasters video game &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising&quot;. The fictionalized version of the island is relocated closer to Russia and China, but the island&#x27;s topography is replicated near-exactly, with elements of the game designed around it, instead of vice versa.

== Kiska Volcano ==

Kiska Volcano (Qisxan Kamgii in Aleut) is an active stratovolcano, in diameter at its base and high, located on the northern end of Kiska Island.

On January 24, 1962, an explosive eruption occurred, accompanied by lava extrusion and the construction of a cinder cone about high at Sirius Point on the north flank of Kiska Volcano, from the summit of the main cone (&quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot;, January 30, 1962). A second eruption that produced a lava flow was reported to have occurred on March 18, 1964 (&quot;Bulletin of Volcanic Eruptions&quot;, 1964).

Since then, the volcano has emitted steam and ash plumes, as well as smaller lava flows.

<doc id="462495" wikidata="Q6386696" url="?curid=462495" title="Kelvin MacKenzie">
<text>Kelvin Calder MacKenzie (born 22 October 1946) is an English media executive and a former newspaper editor. He became editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1981, by which time the publication had been established as Britain&#x27;s largest circulation newspaper. After leaving &quot;The Sun&quot; in 1994, he was appointed to executive roles in satellite television and other broadcasting outlets, as well as being involved in a number of publishing enterprises.

After short periods as a columnist at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, MacKenzie returned to &quot;The Sun&quot; as a columnist. His contract was terminated by mutual consent in May 2017, after he was suspended for comparing footballer Ross Barkley to a gorilla.

==Early life and career==
MacKenzie was born in Thanet, Kent, to Ian and Mary MacKenzie, both journalists working for &quot;The South London Observer&quot;. When the South London Press took over their paper, Mary became press chief for the Conservative leader of the Greater London Council, Horace Cutler. Educated at Alleyn&#x27;s School in Dulwich, MacKenzie left school with one O-level in English literature. He joined the &quot;South East London Mercury&quot; at 17 and, for the next ten years, worked on local and then national newspapers, including the &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

MacKenzie has said that, early in his career, he discovered that he had little writing ability and that his talents lay in making up headlines and laying out pages. By 1978, at the age of 32, he became managing editor of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, two years after it had been purchased by Rupert Murdoch.

==Editor of &quot;The Sun&quot;==
After moving back to the United Kingdom, and a period as night editor of the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Murdoch appointed MacKenzie to &quot;The Sun&quot; as editor in 1981. Conflict between the two mastheads meant that MacKenzie performed both jobs for a time.

In 1978, &quot;The Sun&quot; had overtaken the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; as the newspaper with the highest sales in the UK. MacKenzie cemented the paper&#x27;s image as a right-wing tabloid, not only increasing its profile, but also making it known for attacks on left-wing political figures and movements, and its sensationalist front-page celebrity exposés. They often proved to be misleading or false, and many controversies in that area occurred during MacKenzie&#x27;s editorship. Commentators including &quot;The Guardian&quot; contributor Roy Greenslade, and journalist John Pilger, commented on the alleged &quot;Murdoch effect&quot;. MacKenzie himself stated that he felt his own spell as editor of &quot;The Sun&quot; had a &quot;positively downhill impact on journalism&quot;.

The paper was frequently accused of dumbing down public discourse because of its preoccupations. Pilger blamed it for the promotion of jingoism, racism, homophobia, and intolerance. It was widely criticised for its perceived cruelty both to the targets of Mackenzie&#x27;s – sometimes false – allegations. Frequently, his choice of targets were not only left-wing politicians and celebrities, but also ordinary members of the public. His alleged cruelty to his own staff and colleagues was also criticised, to which MacKenzie later responded: &quot;Look, I am not here to be helpful. I am here to help myself, right, so I have no regrets to how I treated some people.&quot;

===Headlines===
MacKenzie was responsible for the &quot;Gotcha&quot; front-page headline of 4 May 1982, which reported the contentious sinking of the Argentinian cruiser &quot;General Belgrano&quot; by a British submarine during the Falklands War. MacKenzie was criticised by some commentators for the headline, although he had actually changed the front-page of later editions to &quot;Did 1,200 Argies drown?&quot; after it was established that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties.

MacKenzie&#x27;s coverage of the Falklands War was criticised by some commentators for being a glorification of war (Greenslade was working with MacKenzie on &quot;The Sun&quot; at the time).

MacKenzie was responsible for the &quot;Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster&quot; front-page headline. The claims made in the accompanying article, that the comedian Freddie Starr had placed his girlfriend&#x27;s hamster on a sandwich and ate it, turned out to be entirely untrue and was an invention of the publicist Max Clifford. That headline is often held up as the prime example of &quot;The Sun&quot;&#x27;s supposedly celebrity-obsessed, sensationalist and often inaccurate journalism.

===Politics===
In the general elections which were held during his time as editor, MacKenzie&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; strongly supported the Conservative Party and its policies.

Although the coverage of the 1992 election is particularly prominent, there were many other vitriolic personal attacks on Labour leaders by MacKenzie&#x27;s &quot;Sun&quot; during elections, such as during the 1983 campaign, when MacKenzie ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of Michael Foot, then nearly 70 years old, alongside the headline &quot;Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?&quot;.

MacKenzie&#x27;s coverage of the British miners&#x27; strike in 1984–1985 was supportive of the actions of the police and the Thatcher government against the striking NUM miners. The paper was accused of making misleading or even outright false claims about the miners, their unions, and their leader Arthur Scargill. At one point, MacKenzie prepared a front page with the headline &quot;Mine Führer&quot; and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose giving the appearance of him making a Nazi salute. Print workers at &quot;The Sun&quot;, regarding it as being a cheap smear, refused to print it.

At the time of the 1987 general election, MacKenzie ran a mock-editorial entitled &quot;Why I&#x27;m Backing Kinnock, by Joseph Stalin&quot;.

On the day of the 1992 election, MacKenzie used the front-page headline &quot;If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights&quot;, accompanied by a picture of Kinnock&#x27;s head superimposed over a lightbulb. Although the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, that soon changed. According to MacKenzie, following the UK&#x27;s forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, Major telephoned him to ask how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has said his response was: &quot;Prime Minister, I have on my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you.&quot;

===False stories===
In January 1987, MacKenzie published a completely untrue front-page story alleging that pop singer Elton John had engaged in sex with underage rentboys. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published another entirely false allegation that the singer had had the voice boxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him awake at night. Shortly after publication, MacKenzie confirmed the inaccuracy of that story by sending a reporter to the singer&#x27;s house, who quickly discovered that all of Elton John&#x27;s guard dogs were quite capable of barking.

MacKenzie later said that he found it difficult to understand why he had believed, let alone published, the claims about the guard dogs, which he later realised were absurd. Elton John sued &quot;The Sun&quot; for libel over both of the fallacious claims and was awarded £1,000,000 in damages. MacKenzie later said of Elton John:
There were many other controversies during MacKenzie&#x27;s time in charge of &quot;The Sun&quot;. At one point, he ran a story about a previously unknown member of the public who had just undergone a heart transplant operation. The story denounced the man as a &quot;love rat&quot;, &quot;Sun&quot; journalists having been told that he had left his wife 15 years earlier. Aside from criticism about the story&#x27;s highly questionable news value, the newspaper was furiously condemned as the story was run when the man&#x27;s recovery was still in the balance.

MacKenzie and his team were accused of simply inventing many of the stories that appeared in the newspaper, as well as interviews and, in some instances, that proved to be the case, such as when an entirely fabricated interview with the disfigured Falklands war hero Simon Weston was published, which was criticised for &quot;inviting readers to feel revulsion at his disfigurement&quot;. MacKenzie himself once told his staff: &quot;Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the royals. Don&#x27;t worry if it&#x27;s not true—so long as there&#x27;s not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.&quot;

Some other controversies during MacKenzie&#x27;s editorship include a headline describing Australian Aborigines as &quot;The Abo&#x27;s: Brutal and Treacherous&quot;, which was condemned as &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;unacceptably racist&quot; by the Press Council, and MacKenzie&#x27;s sending of photographers to break into a psychiatric hospital to ask actor Jeremy Brett, who was a patient there at the time, and who was suffering from manic depression and dying of cardiomyopathy, whether he was &quot;dying of AIDS&quot;. The newspaper apparently suspected Brett of being a homosexual and that his mystery illness might be AIDS, which it was not.

Those incidents led to considerable criticism of &quot;The Sun&quot;, but the newspaper&#x27;s profile increased dramatically during MacKenzie&#x27;s time as editor, although sales figures dipped. On the subject of the sensationalist and sometimes inaccurate reporting which appeared in &quot;The Sun&quot; during his time as editor, MacKenzie said:
===Hillsborough disaster coverage===


April 1989 saw the single biggest controversy during MacKenzie&#x27;s period as editor, later described in a &quot;Sun&quot; editorial in 2004 as &quot;the most terrible mistake in our history&quot;, occurred in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, a crowd crush during an FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield, which claimed the lives of 97 Liverpool fans.

Three days after the disaster, &quot;The Sun&quot; published an editorial which accused people of &quot;scapegoating&quot; the police, saying that the disaster occurred &quot;because thousands of fans, many without tickets tried to get into the ground just before kick-off – either by forcing their way in or by blackmailing the police into opening the gates&quot;.

The next day, &quot;The Sun&quot; had the front-page headline, &quot;The Truth&quot;, and accused Liverpool fans of theft, and of urinating on and attacking police officers and emergency services. It quoted Conservative Member of Parliament Irvine Patnick to support its claim that a group of Liverpool supporters told a police officer that they would have sex with a dead female victim. The journalist who wrote the first draft of the article, Harry Arnold, said that MacKenzie claimed he would &quot;make it clear that this is what some people are saying&quot;, but MacKenzie chose the headline &quot;The Truth&quot; only after staff members convinced him not to use &quot;You Scum&quot;. Its source was a Sheffield news agency, Whites, which later said that four South Yorkshire Police officers were the source of the claims, as well as &quot;a leading MP backing many of the police claims&quot;.

The article was accompanied by graphic photographs showing Liverpool fans, including young children, choking and suffocating as they were being crushed against the perimeter fences surrounding the terraces – this was widely condemned as inappropriate.

In their book about the history of &quot;The Sun&quot;, Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie wrote:

Prior to the publication of &quot;The Sun&quot;″s initial article, a number of local newspapers in Yorkshire, including the &quot;Sheffield Star&quot; and &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;, published very similar allegations. It has since emerged that many British national newspaper editors were offered the same story from the same sources the day before &quot;The Sun&quot; article was published but, while many national newspapers printed allegations about Liverpool fans being responsible for the disaster, only MacKenzie and his counterpart at the &quot;Daily Star&quot; were prepared to print the more outlandish allegations about theft and the abuse of dead bodies, with many editors feeling that the claims sounded dubious.

For his part, Murdoch ordered MacKenzie to appear on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The World This Weekend&quot; in the aftermath of the controversy to apologise. MacKenzie said on the programme: &quot;It was my decision and my decision alone to do that front page in that way and I made a rather serious error&quot;.

For years, MacKenzie maintained that his &quot;only mistake was to believe a Tory MP&quot;. In 1993, he told a House of Commons committee, &quot;I regret Hillsborough. It was a fundamental mistake. The mistake was I believed what an MP said&quot;. Next year, on &quot;Question Time&quot;, MacKenzie said that he believed some of the material he published in &quot;The Sun&quot; but was not sure about all of it. In 2012, he said: &quot;Twenty-three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium... these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters... I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong&quot;. A member of the Hillsborough Families Support Group responded &quot;too little, too late&quot;.

A widespread boycott of &quot;The Sun&quot; throughout Merseyside followed immediately and continues to this day. The boycott involves customers refusing to purchase the paper, and retailers refusing to stock it. In 2019, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Merseyside sales were estimated to have dropped from 55,000 per day to 12,000 per day, an 80% decrease. In 2014, Chris Horrie estimated that, in 1989 prices, the tabloid&#x27;s owner had lost £15million per month since the disaster.

The Press Council described the allegations unequivocally as &quot;lies&quot;. The official government enquiry into the disaster dismissed the allegation that drunken Liverpool fans had been responsible for the disaster, and concluded that inadequate crowd control and errors by the police had been the primary cause of the tragedy.

In 2024, it was reported that the Hillsborough coverage by &quot;The Sun&quot; would be used to train MPs to recognise false news stories.

==After editing &quot;The Sun&quot;==
In January 1994, MacKenzie moved to BSkyB, another of Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation assets, but left after a few months.

In 1995, MacKenzie joined Mirror Group Newspapers and was appointed joint boss of its fledgling L!VE TV British cable television channel. The station had previously been headed by Janet Street-Porter, who had set out to establish L!VE TV as an alternative, youth-orientated station. She clashed with MacKenzie over programme content and soon left, leaving him in sole charge.

MacKenzie later said that he would agree to indulge in a &quot;night of passion&quot; with Janet Street-Porter and that he would be &quot;willing&quot;, but only if she paid him £4.7m, a figure he had arrived at after calculating how much money he would lose from &quot;loss of reputation, the negative impact on future earnings etc&quot;.

MacKenzie took a radically different approach to that of his predecessor and produced cheap, down-market programming. He introduced features such as nightly editions of &quot;Topless Darts&quot; (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), &quot;The Weather in Norwegian&quot; (with a young, typically-blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian) and other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines.

A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers. L!VE TV&#x27;s best known character was the News Bunny, a man dressed as a giant rabbit who popped up during news broadcasts to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the various news stories, to indicate whether or not he found them interesting or exciting.

L!VE TV had a budget of only £2,000 an hour and attracted a small audience, with an average of 200,000 viewers, but became well known because of the controversy and criticism surrounding its programming. That led to the station being labelled &quot;Tabloid TV&quot; and even &quot;Sun TV&quot; (in reference to the newspaper. Some critics accused MacKenzie of doing nothing more than creating a television version of his old newspaper), and of taking a &quot;shamelessly tacky approach&quot;. He left the station in 1997.

He later said on L!VE TV:

 The station failed and closed after less than four years.

In November 1998, MacKenzie headed a consortium, TalkCo Holdings, which purchased Talk Radio from CLT for £24.7 million. One of the financial backers was News International, News Corporation&#x27;s UK subsidiary. In 1999, TalkCo was renamed The Wireless Group and, in January 2000, Talk Radio was rebranded as Talksport. The Wireless Group acquired The Radio Partnership in 1999, gaining control of its nine local commercial stations. In May 2005, it was announced that the Northern Irish media company, UTV plc, had made an agreed offer to buy the company, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In June 2005, the takeover proceeded, with MacKenzie being replaced by UTV executive Scott Taunton.

MacKenzie spent a year as chairman of one of the UK&#x27;s largest marketing and communications groups, Media Square plc. That was unsuccessful and MacKenzie left a year later, in March 2007.

In March 2006, MacKenzie joined BBC Radio 5 Live as a presenter. He made his debut on the station over the summer, presenting a series of programmes telling the story of various scandals which have occurred at FIFA World Cup tournaments over the years. He then presented a retrospective look at the year gone by on Christmas Day.

In May 2006, MacKenzie returned to &quot;The Sun&quot; as a columnist, and was accused of using one of his articles to attack the people of Scotland (see below). On the subject of the columns themselves, he said &quot;I want to get the Lonsdale Belt for vile and be personally rude to as many people as possible.&quot; In June 2011, it was announced that MacKenzie would leave &quot;The Sun&quot; to write a column for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

In December 2016, during a civil court case, it emerged that MacKenzie had left &quot;The Sun&quot; because Rebekah Brooks, then head of News International, and Dominic Mohan, then editor of &quot;The Sun&quot;, had not told him of the extent of the company&#x27;s phone hacking scandal. MacKenzie was also concerned about their employment of Jeremy Clarkson whose privacy injunction against his ex-wife was then in force. However he left the &quot;Mail&quot; in July 2012 after writing for the title for one year, citing an &quot;increased commercial workload&quot;. Subsequently, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that MacKenzie&#x27;s departure from the &quot;Mail&quot; was due to disagreements regarding the editing of his column.

MacKenzie was an early investor in online video company Base79, established in 2007 by his son Ashley MacKenzie. They sold the firm in 2014.

In 2011, MacKenzie launched the online TV channel Sports Tonight, describing the channel as &quot;Sky Sports News meets TalkSport&quot;. The channel received investment from former Conservative Party treasurer Lord Ashcroft, who took a minority stake.

MacKenzie joined &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as an online columnist in 2013, but he was dropped by the newspaper after one column, with Roy Greenslade reporting in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that he was let go because staff on the &quot;Telegraph&quot; sports desk were annoyed about his role in the false reporting on the Hillsborough disaster, in particular, football columnist and ex-Liverpool player Alan Hansen, who had played at Hillsborough.

In April 2013, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; was being sued for libel for £200,000 over a column by MacKenzie. The claim was brought by an NHS doctor, Antonio Serrano, who MacKenzie had criticised in an article.

In October 2014, MacKenzie was a contestant on gameshow &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;. Some angered viewers complained about MacKenzie&#x27;s presence to host Richard Osman, who said that if he had known in advance, he would not have let him appear.

In December 2014, &quot;The Sun&quot; announced that MacKenzie would make a second return to the newspaper as a columnist.

==Politics==
MacKenzie&#x27;s commitment to Conservative, Thatcherite politics has led him to argue that Margaret Thatcher is the UK&#x27;s greatest post-war prime minister. In 2003, he presented a documentary, &quot;Kelvin Saves the Tories&quot;, in which he proposed a low-tax, anti-BBC, and cautiously pro-capital punishment manifesto for the party. However, in February 2008, in a &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper article, MacKenzie wrote that he was against the return of the death penalty.

In May 2008, MacKenzie stood for election as a local councillor in Elmbridge. He lost the election, gaining 227 votes, whereas the Conservative incumbent, Glenn Dearlove, won 679.

That same year, after Conservative member of parliament David Davis announced that he would resign his seat in the House of Commons in order to fight a by-election as a protest against the Labour government&#x27;s plans for 42-day detention without charge for terrorist suspects, MacKenzie announced that he was likely to contest the election on a pro-42-day detention platform, stating: &quot;I have been associated with &quot;The Sun&quot; for 30 years. &quot;The Sun&quot; is very, very hostile to David Davis because of his 28 day stance and &quot;The Sun&quot; has always been very up for 42 days and perhaps even 420 days&quot;. Off-camera, before a BBC interview, MacKenzie referred to Hull, which the Haltemprice and Howden constituency borders, as &quot;an absolute shocker&quot;. Asked to clarify those comments, he said it was &quot;a joke&quot; and that he has &quot;never actually been to Hull&quot;.

MacKenzie subsequently decided not to run for the Haltemprice and Howden seat, stating: &quot;The clincher for me was the money. Clearly &quot;The Sun&quot; couldn&#x27;t put up the cash – so I was going to have to rustle up a maximum of £100,000 to conduct my campaign.&quot;

==Later developments in the Hillsborough controversy==
===Incidents in 2006–2007===
During an after-dinner speech to Newcastle-based law firm Mincoffs Solicitors on 30 November 2006, MacKenzie is reported to have said of his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster:

MacKenzie went on to compare Merseysiders with animal rights activists. &quot;If this got out, it would blow up all over again&quot;, MacKenzie is said to have remarked.

The remarks were met with widespread incredulity and condemnation, particularly on Merseyside, where Liverpool F.C., the local &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; and numerous local MPs condemned MacKenzie, with Walton MP Peter Kilfoyle arguing that the quotes confirmed that MacKenzie was &quot;never fit to edit a national newspaper&quot;. The &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; called for &quot;The Sun&quot; to sack MacKenzie as a columnist. &quot;The Sun&quot; issued a statement saying that they had &quot;already apologised for what happened and we stand by that apology.&quot; However, despite reports of consternation at &quot;The Sun&quot; over MacKenzie&#x27;s statements, the newspaper chose to retain him as a columnist. MacKenzie refused to comment publicly on the controversy and pulled out of a scheduled appearance on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; later that week.

Earlier that autumn MacKenzie had already provoked controversy in Liverpool by stating in a &quot;Press Gazette&quot; interview that he had never knowingly printed any lies in &quot;The Sun&quot; and that even stories which later turned out to be untrue were still &quot;good stories&quot;. In relation to the publishing of false or misleading reports in &quot;The Sun&quot;, MacKenzie asked &quot;What am I supposed to feel ashamed about?&quot; MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; published a piece reporting MacKenzie&#x27;s statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a &quot;good story&quot;).

Although there was actually little reaction to the quotes on Merseyside at the time, they did draw comment from Phil Hammond, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who said: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe that even after all these years, there is no remorse or regret for the hurt he caused&quot;. It was still thought at this point however that, although MacKenzie appeared not to regret the coverage, he no longer regarded it as having any factual basis after his apparent admissions in the past that the allegations made were lies fed to him by police officers and a Conservative MP.

In February 2007, &quot;Independent&quot; journalist Matthew Norman claimed that MacKenzie was considering issuing a public apology for his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, although at the time he was &quot;still unsure&quot; as to whether to do so. His former colleague at &quot;The Sun&quot;, Roy Greenslade has suggested that the real reason why MacKenzie may be so hesitant to apologise and admit the inaccuracy of the coverage may be his &quot;anti-Scouse&quot; bias, which Greenslade suspects makes it difficult for MacKenzie to &quot;bring himself to say sorry to the city&#x27;s people&quot;.

===Fan exoneration (2012)===
On 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld government papers which has exonerated the Liverpool fans present at the match, MacKenzie issued the following statement:

Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie&#x27;s apology as &quot;too little, too late&quot;, calling him &quot;lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife&quot;. The copy from White&#x27;s news agency was available to other newspapers, who reported the story as allegations – &quot;The Sun&quot; reported the allegations, on McKenzie&#x27;s say-so, as &#x27;the truth&#x27;.

Following the Warrington Inquests verdicts, Mackenzie was door-stepped by Alex Thomson of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. MacKenzie was filmed saying: &quot;Please Alex, this isn&#x27;t reasonable&quot;. Nine complaints were received by Ofcom asserting MacKenzie&#x27;s privacy had been invaded, but in its adjudication, the regulator rejected the application.

===Comments in 2016–2017===
Despite apologising on a number of platforms, in 2016, MacKenzie made a joke in &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper that if it was true that George Osborne (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) was putting gongs up for sale, he should be made Lord MacKenzie of Anfield (Liverpool FC&#x27;s home stadium).

A day before the 28th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in April 2017, MacKenzie&#x27;s column in &quot;The Sun&quot; mentioned the Everton footballer Ross Barkley appearing to imply Barkley deserved to be beaten up in a nightclub incident earlier in the week. Comparing the player to a &quot;gorilla at the zoo&quot;, MacKenzie was accused of racism (Barkley is of part-Nigerian descent). The column was removed from the newspaper&#x27;s website on the afternoon of its day of publication. Later in the day, a spokesman for the newspaper apologised &quot;for the offence caused&quot; and said the columnist &quot;has been suspended from the paper with immediate effect. The views expressed by Kelvin Mackenzie about the people of Liverpool were wrong, unfunny and are not the view of the paper&quot;. A month after the column appeared, it was announced that MacKenzie&#x27;s &quot;contract with News Group Newspapers&quot;, the &quot;Sun&quot;″s publishers, &quot;has been terminated by mutual consent&quot;.

In response to MacKenzie&#x27;s article, on the day of its publication Everton FC banned &quot;The Sun&quot; and its reporters &quot;from all areas of its operation&quot; following Liverpool FC who had made such a decision about &quot;The Sun&quot; in February 2017.

==Views==
===Scotland===
MacKenzie has criticised Scotland, although he is of Scottish descent – his grandfather was from Stirling.

In July 2006, MacKenzie wrote a column for &quot;The Sun&quot; referring to Scots as &quot;Tartan Tosspots&quot; and apparently rejoicing in the fact that Scotland has a lower life expectancy than the rest of the United Kingdom. MacKenzie&#x27;s column provoked a storm of protest and was heavily condemned by numerous commentators including Scottish MPs and MSPs.

On 11 October 2007, MacKenzie appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; TV programme and launched another attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie said that:
The comments came as part of criticism of prime minister Gordon Brown, whom MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was &quot;a socialist Scot&quot;, and stating that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist Chuka Umunna from the think tank Compass called his comments &quot;absolutely disgraceful&quot;, and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received around 200 complaints and MacKenzie&#x27;s comments drew widespread criticism, including comments from the Scottish entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne who responded on BBC Radio 5 Live:

On 13 January 2012, MacKenzie once again appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and remarked on the move for Scottish independence: 

===Hijabs===
In July 2016, after the Nice (France) truck attack, MacKenzie wrote an article for &quot;The Sun&quot; in which he queried whether it was appropriate for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; presenter Fatima Manji to read the news wearing a hijab. Manji accused MacKenzie of attempting to &quot;intimidate Muslims out of public life&quot; and attempting to smear 1.6 billion Muslims in suggesting they are inherently violent. She said, &quot;He has attempted to smear half of them further by suggesting they are helpless slaves. And he has attempted to smear me by suggesting I would sympathise with a terrorist&quot;.

The Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) received 17 complaints about Manji wearing the hijab, an objection which was rejected. Eventually, the IPSO received 1,700 complaints about MacKenzie&#x27;s article. The IPSO ruled in October 2016 that MacKenzie was &quot;entitled&quot; to make his comments, and a &quot;prejudicial or pejorative reference&quot; to Manji&#x27;s religion was not present in the article. Manji said the ruling meant it was now &quot;open season on minorities, and Muslims in particular&quot;.

===Irish===
In December 2020, MacKenzie tweeted that the Irish love the Germans and did not fight to save Jewish people in World War II. An estimated 70,000 Irish citizens served in the British Armed Forces, along with an estimated 50,000 from Northern Ireland.

==Personal life==
MacKenzie married Jacqueline Holland in 1968 in Camberwell. They had a daughter (born 1969) and two sons (born 1972 and 1974). His elder son and his daughter worked at Talkradio. In the late 1990s, MacKenzie was featured in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, holidaying in what the paper described as a &quot;love nest&quot; in Barbados with News International secretary Joanna Duckworth.

<doc id="462499" wikidata="Q3191171" url="?curid=462499" title="Powerful number">
<text>A powerful number is a positive integer &quot;m&quot; such that for every prime number &quot;p&quot; dividing &quot;m&quot;, &quot;p&quot;2 also divides &quot;m&quot;. Equivalently, a powerful number is the product of a square and a cube, that is, a number &quot;m&quot; of the form &quot;m&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot;3, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are positive integers. Powerful numbers are also known as squareful, square-full, or 2-full. Paul Erdős and George Szekeres studied such numbers and Solomon W. Golomb named such numbers &quot;powerful&quot;.

The following is a list of all powerful numbers between 1 and 1000:
:1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100, 108, 121, 125, 128, 144, 169, 196, 200, 216, 225, 243, 256, 288, 289, 324, 343, 361, 392, 400, 432, 441, 484, 500, 512, 529, 576, 625, 648, 675, 676, 729, 784, 800, 841, 864, 900, 961, 968, 972, 1000, ... .
== Equivalence of the two definitions ==

If &quot;m&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot;3, then every prime in the prime factorization of &quot;a&quot; appears in the prime factorization of &quot;m&quot; with an exponent of at least two, and every prime in the prime factorization of &quot;b&quot; appears in the prime factorization of &quot;m&quot; with an exponent of at least three; therefore, &quot;m&quot; is powerful.

In the other direction, suppose that &quot;m&quot; is powerful, with prime factorization
:formula_1
where each &quot;α&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≥ 2. Define &quot;γ&quot;&quot;i&quot; to be three if &quot;α&quot;&quot;i&quot; is odd, and zero otherwise, and define &quot;β&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;α&quot;&quot;i&quot; − &quot;γ&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Then, all values &quot;β&quot;&quot;i&quot; are nonnegative even integers, and all values γi are either zero or three, so

:formula_2

supplies the desired representation of &quot;m&quot; as a product of a square and a cube.

Informally, given the prime factorization of &quot;m&quot;, take &quot;b&quot; to be the product of the prime factors of &quot;m&quot; that have an odd exponent (if there are none, then take &quot;b&quot; to be 1). Because &quot;m&quot; is powerful, each prime factor with an odd exponent has an exponent that is at least 3, so &quot;m&quot;/&quot;b&quot;3 is an integer. In addition, each prime factor of &quot;m&quot;/&quot;b&quot;3 has an even exponent, so &quot;m&quot;/&quot;b&quot;3 is a perfect square, so call this &quot;a&quot;2; then &quot;m&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot;3. For example:

:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6

The representation &quot;m&quot; = &quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot;3 calculated in this way has the property that &quot;b&quot; is squarefree, and is uniquely defined by this property.

== Mathematical properties ==

The sum of the reciprocals of the powerful numbers converges. The value of this sum may be written in several other ways, including as the infinite product

: formula_7

where &quot;p&quot; runs over all primes, &quot;ζ&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) denotes the Riemann zeta function, and &quot;ζ&quot;(3) is Apéry&#x27;s constant. 
More generally, the sum of the reciprocals of the &quot;s&quot;th powers of the powerful numbers (a Dirichlet series generating function) is equal to

:formula_8

whenever it converges.

Let &quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) denote the number of powerful numbers in the interval [1,&quot;x&quot;]. Then &quot;k&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is proportional to the square root of &quot;x&quot;. More precisely,

: formula_9

(Golomb, 1970).

The two smallest consecutive powerful numbers are 8 and 9. Since Pell&#x27;s equation has infinitely many integral solutions, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers (Golomb, 1970); more generally, one can find consecutive powerful numbers by solving a similar Pell equation for any perfect cube . However, one of the two powerful numbers in a pair formed in this way must be a square. According to Guy, Erdős has asked whether there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers such as in which neither number in the pair is a square. showed that there are indeed infinitely many such pairs by showing that has infinitely many solutions.
Walker&#x27;s solutions to this equation are generated, for any odd integer , by considering the number

:formula_10

for integers divisible by 7 and divisible by 3,
and constructing from and the consecutive powerful numbers and with .
The smallest consecutive pair in this family is generated for , , and as

:formula_11

and

:formula_12
It is a conjecture of Erdős, Mollin, and Walsh that there are no three consecutive powerful numbers. If a triplet of consecutive powerful numbers exists, then its smallest term must be congruent to 7, 27, or 35 modulo 36.

If the abc conjecture is true, there are only a finite number of sets of three consecutive powerful numbers.

== Sums and differences of powerful numbers ==
Any odd number is a difference of two consecutive squares: (&quot;k&quot; + 1)2 = &quot;k&quot;2 + 2&quot;k&quot; + 1, so (&quot;k&quot; + 1)2 − &quot;k&quot;2 = 2&quot;k&quot; + 1. Similarly, any multiple of four is a difference of the squares of two numbers that differ by two: (&quot;k&quot; + 2)2 − &quot;k&quot;2 = 4&quot;k&quot; + 4. However, a singly even number, that is, a number divisible by two but not by four, cannot be expressed as a difference of squares. This motivates the question of determining which singly even numbers can be expressed as differences of powerful numbers. Golomb exhibited some representations of this type:

:2 = 33 − 52
:10 = 133 − 37
:18 = 192 − 73 = 35 − 152.

It had been conjectured that 6 cannot be so represented, and Golomb conjectured that there are infinitely many integers which cannot be represented as a difference between two powerful numbers. However, Narkiewicz showed that 6 can be so represented in infinitely many ways such as

:6 = 5473 − 4632,

and McDaniel showed that every integer has infinitely many such representations (McDaniel, 1982).

Erdős conjectured that every sufficiently large integer is a sum of at most three powerful numbers; this was proved by Roger Heath-Brown (1987).

== Generalization ==

More generally, we can consider the integers all of whose prime factors have exponents at least &quot;k&quot;. Such an integer is called a &quot;k&quot;-powerful number, &quot;k&quot;-ful number, or &quot;k&quot;-full number.

:(2&quot;k&quot;+1 − 1)&quot;k&quot;,  2&quot;k&quot;(2&quot;k&quot;+1 − 1)&quot;k&quot;,   (2&quot;k&quot;+1 − 1)&quot;k&quot;+1

are &quot;k&quot;-powerful numbers in an arithmetic progression. Moreover, if &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot; are &quot;k&quot;-powerful in an arithmetic progression with common difference &quot;d&quot;, then

: &quot;a&quot;1(&quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)&quot;k&quot;,  
&quot;a&quot;2(&quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)&quot;k&quot;, ..., &quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)&quot;k&quot;, (&quot;a&quot;&quot;s&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)&quot;k&quot;+1

are &quot;s&quot; + 1 &quot;k&quot;-powerful numbers in an arithmetic progression.

We have an identity involving &quot;k&quot;-powerful numbers:

:&quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;ℓ&quot; + ... + 1)&quot;k&quot; + &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; + 1(&quot;a&quot;&quot;ℓ&quot; + ... + 1)&quot;k&quot; + ... + &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;ℓ&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;ℓ&quot; + ... + 1)&quot;k&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;k&quot;(&quot;a&quot;&quot;ℓ&quot; + ... +1)&quot;k&quot;+1.

This gives infinitely many &quot;l&quot;+1-tuples of &quot;k&quot;-powerful numbers whose sum is also &quot;k&quot;-powerful. Nitaj shows there are infinitely many solutions of &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot; in relatively prime 3-powerful numbers(Nitaj, 1995). Cohn constructs an infinite family of solutions of &quot;x&quot; + &quot;y&quot; = &quot;z&quot; in relatively prime non-cube 3-powerful numbers as follows: the triplet

:&quot;X&quot; = 9712247684771506604963490444281, &quot;Y&quot; = 32295800804958334401937923416351, &quot;Z&quot; = 27474621855216870941749052236511

is a solution of the equation 32&quot;X&quot;3 + 49&quot;Y&quot;3 = 81&quot;Z&quot;3. We can construct another solution by setting &#x27; = &quot;X&quot;(49&quot;Y&quot;3 + 81&quot;Z&quot;3), &#x27; = −&quot;Y&quot;(32&quot;X&quot;3 + 81&quot;Z&quot;3), &quot;&quot; = &quot;Z&quot;(32&quot;X&quot;3 − 49&quot;Y&quot;3) and omitting the common divisor.

<doc id="462500" wikidata="Q231207" url="?curid=462500" title="Charlotte Church">
<text>Charlotte Maria Church (born Charlotte Maria Reed, 21 February 1986) is a Welsh singer-songwriter, actress, and television presenter from Cardiff.

As a child, Church was a popular classical singer with a less-successful attempt to move into pop music in 2005. By 2007, she had sold more than ten million records worldwide including over five million in the United States. She hosted a Channel 4 chat show titled &quot;The Charlotte Church Show&quot;. Church released her first album in five years, titled &quot;Back to Scratch&quot;, on 25 October 2010. Church is a soprano.

In recent years, Church has embraced political activism, supporting Jeremy Corbyn when he led the Labour party, Plaid Cymru in the Senedd elections, and the cause of Welsh independence.

==Early life==
Church was born Charlotte Maria Reed in Llandaff, a district of Cardiff, Wales, to Maria and computer engineer Stephen Reed. Her parents separated when she was two, and she was raised by her mother who brought her up as a Roman Catholic. In 1992, Maria married her second husband, James Church, who adopted Charlotte in 1999. She has four siblings: two younger half-brothers, through her biological father, and two older step-siblings from her adoptive father&#x27;s previous marriage.

Charlotte&#x27;s musical break came at age 11 when she sang Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; over the telephone on the television show &quot;This Morning&quot;, followed by her performance on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Big, Big Talent Show&quot; the same year. Subsequent to a request to sing &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; at Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s 1999 wedding to Wendy Deng, it was revealed Murdoch and Church&#x27;s management at the time persuaded Church to waive a $100,000 payment for singing at his wedding in return for &quot;good press&quot;. Church also received a vocal scholarship to Howell&#x27;s School Llandaff in Cardiff where she started in 1998, after leaving The Cathedral School, Llandaff. With help from tutors, she was able to manage both performing and school work, and said in many interviews that she was &quot;just like every other girl her age&quot;. She left school at age 16.

==Music career==
===1998–2002: Classical career===

As a classical music singer, Church sang in English, Welsh, Latin, Italian, and French. She was then introduced to the Cardiff impresario Jonathan Shalit, who became her manager and negotiated a contract with Sony Music. Her first album, &quot;Voice of an Angel&quot; (1998), was a collection of arias, sacred songs, and traditional pieces that sold millions worldwide and made her the youngest artist with a No. 1 album on the British classical crossover charts.

Church appeared on US Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) specials. Her 1999 eponymous second album also included operatic, religious, and traditional tracks. One, &quot;Just Wave Hello&quot;, was the centrepiece of a millennium-themed ad campaign for the Ford Motor Company. The song&#x27;s full-length video, featuring Church, won acclaim at the Detroit Auto Show and introduced her to new fans. The track reached No. 31 in Britain.

In 2000, she released &quot;Dream a Dream&quot;, an album of Christmas carols. It included Church&#x27;s first foray into a more non-classical, pop-influenced style in the title track &quot;Dream a Dream&quot;, borrowing the melody from Fauré&#x27;s Pavane and featuring American child country singer Billy Gilman.

In 2001, Church added more pop, swing, and Broadway with her album &quot;Enchantment&quot;. That year, Church made her first film appearance in the 2001 Ron Howard film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. Celine Dion was beginning a concert engagement in Las Vegas and was not available to perform the film&#x27;s end title song, &quot;All Love Can Be&quot;, so composer James Horner enlisted Church and the song was rewritten for her vocal range. Church also handled other vocal passages throughout the score.

In 2002, at 16, she released a &quot;best of&quot; album called &quot;&quot;, and took part in the Royal Christmas tour alongside Dame Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, marking the end of her classical music career. Her next album, &quot;Tissues and Issues&quot;, would be a pop release.

===2003–2009: Pursuing pop career; &quot;Tissues and Issues&quot;===
In 2003 Church teamed up with trance music producer Jurgen Vries to sing vocals on his track &quot;The Opera Song (Brave New World)&quot;. She was credited on the records as CMC (her initials) as it was her first foray into pop music. The song reached number three in the UK Singles Chart, Church&#x27;s second highest-charting single and Vries&#x27; highest.

In 2005, Church issued her first pop album &quot;Tissues and Issues.&quot; Four singles were successful in the UK with &quot;Crazy Chick&quot; reaching number two, &quot;Call My Name&quot; number ten, &quot;Even God Can&#x27;t Change the Past&quot; number seventeen, and &quot;Moodswings&quot; number fourteen. Although these were released in Australia as well, they failed to reach the same level of success there. Church&#x27;s pop album was released in the US through Amazon.com MP3 shop, and iTunes in 2009.

In April 2006, Church performed three concerts in Glasgow, London, and Cardiff, in venues holding between 2,000 and 3,000 people; the dates at London and Cardiff were sold out. Supported by Irish band the New Druids, Church performed a mix of tracks from her debut pop album and a number of pop covers including Prince&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot; and Gloria Estefan&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm is Gonna Get You&quot;.

In November 2006, it was announced that she and Sony had parted ways. According to her publicist, this was a mutual decision reached after a series of meetings throughout the year, which were held since her six-album contract had ended. There was speculation that Church had decided to take a break from her singing career to focus on her television show. Others suggested that her pop releases&#x27; chart performance contributed to the decision. Yet another factor was her pregnancy with her daughter, Ruby Megan Henson.
In 2007, Church became Patron of the charity The Topsy Foundation UK, helping to raise awareness and funds for its work to support rural communities in South Africa, empowering people infected with and affected by HIV and AIDS, through medical care, social support and skills development.

Articles emerged in the UK press in March and April 2008 stating that she was still training classically, considering a return to classical crossover. Church has sung in religious services in Taizé. She has also performed before Pope John Paul II, Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III (at that time the Prince of Wales), and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

In June 2008, she became pregnant with her son, Dexter Lloyd Henson. In an interview, she mentioned she would be ready to work on more music in a few months, although she was not sure whether she would further develop her career in classical, pop, or both, as she loved both genres for different reasons. Church also mentioned that she had been working with a vocal instructor to keep her voice in check.

In June 2009, Church was interviewed for &quot;Hello!&quot; magazine, discussing her life since having her second child. She said that she was currently in the studio, resuming work on a new album and that her partner, Gavin Henson, had been strongly encouraging her to get back to work pursuing the career that she has greatly missed since settling down.

===2010–2011: Return to music and &quot;Back to Scratch&quot;===
Church appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot; on 13 March 2010, where she confirmed that she had already begun writing and recording her sixth studio album. Church also stated that the album was of a different sound to previous ones, more mature with a &quot;kooky&quot; vibe.

On 4 August 2010, Church made a new track, &quot;Cold California&quot;, available to download from her website.

Church&#x27;s album, &quot;Back to Scratch&quot;, was released in the UK on 25 October 2010. The 14-track album was produced by Martin Terefe. &quot;Back to Scratch&quot; was preceded by a single – the LP&#x27;s title track – on 24 October. &quot;Back to Scratch&quot; was originally inspired &quot;by problems facing a family member&quot;, but Church admitted in a press release that the song now has resonance to her own personal life following her split from Gavin Henson. &quot;Back to Scratch&quot; also featured the song &quot;The Actors&quot;, which Church performed on BBC One talent contest &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, and a cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;River&quot;.

It was announced on 13 March 2011 that Church had ended her US$3 million deal with Power Amp Music over promotional disputes. Her spokesperson released the following statement: &quot;All I can really say, because of the confidentiality issues, is that it was in Charlotte&#x27;s financial interests to do so before the agreement entered the second year of its term. This is typical for these type of deals, which are investment deals rather than record deals. I can also say that the decision to terminate the term early, which suited both parties, was made well before the commercial release of the album.&quot; A spokesperson from the record label also released a statement saying &quot;It didn&#x27;t work out with Charlotte and that&#x27;s fair enough. There was no falling out. It was a mutual decision. They decided to exit the deal.&quot;

The third single to be released from the album, &quot;Snow&quot; was released on 11 April 2011.

===Since 2012: &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Two&quot;, &quot;Three&quot;, and &quot;Four&quot;===
On 26 May 2012, Church premiered three new songs &quot;The Rise&quot;, &quot;How Not to be Surprised When You&#x27;re a Ghost&quot;, and &quot;Say It&#x27;s True&quot; on BBC Radio with Bethan Elfyn. Church released her first EP &quot;ONE&quot; on 4 September 2012.

On 19 December 2012, Church released the lead single from her second EP, &quot;Glitterbombed&quot; on &quot;The Line of Best Fit&quot;, an online music magazine. Her second EP &quot;Two&quot; was released on 4 March 2013.
&quot;One&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; were combined for a US release on 12 March 2013. Church promoted &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; in the US with her first North American performances in almost a decade. She appeared in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, and at the South by Southwest Festival. Her costumes for her North American concerts were designed by Zoe Howerska.

Church released the lead single from her third EP, &quot;I Can Dream&quot; via SoundCloud on 15 July 2013. Her third EP &quot;THREE&quot; was released on 19 August 2013.

Church&#x27;s fourth EP &quot;Four&quot; was released on 10 March 2014. She released a music video for the lead single from the EP, &quot;Little Movements&quot; on YouTube on 15 March 2014.

==Acting and television career==
Church has made a number of cameo appearances on television. She appeared in the CBS series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, appeared in the 1999 Christmas special of &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, and in 2002, 2003 and 2012 she appeared on episodes of &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (the first time as the show&#x27;s youngest-ever panellist; the second time as host). In 2005, she played herself in an episode of &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot;, in a sketch with the fictional character Joanie Taylor (&quot;Nan&quot;). In 2008, Church appeared briefly in a sketch in &quot;Katy Brand&#x27;s Big Ass Show&quot;.

In December 2005, for &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; Christmas pantomime, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Church played Dorothy Gale.

In the summer of 2006, Church presented an entertainment TV show, &quot;The Charlotte Church Show&quot;. After a pilot episode, which caused some controversy, and was never broadcast, the series began, airing on 1 September 2006 on Channel 4. Church won a British Comedy Award for Best Female Comedy Newcomer in 2006, and the Funniest TV Personality award at the 2006 &quot;Loaded Magazine&#x27;s&quot; LAFTA awards. In 2008, she was nominated for the &quot;Rose d&#x27;Or&quot; Special Award for Best Entertainer.

In late June 2008, Channel 4 began showing trials for the series. It subsequently concluded its eight-episode run. A Christmas special aired on 21 December 2008. 

In January 2010, for &quot;Hospital 24/7&quot;, Church made an appearance on the programme finale, in which she visited the Children&#x27;s Hospital for Wales to launch the Noah&#x27;s Ark Appeals campaign. This was intended to fund the equipment in the new Critical Care Unit, which would help children needing high dependency, or critical and intensive care.

In 2014 Church performed as Mrs Ogmore Pritchard in a BBC adaptation of &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; by Dylan Thomas.

In 2018, Church appeared in the BBC One documentary &quot;Charlotte Church: Inside My Brain&quot;, in which she explores the subject of mental health and the various kinds of research being done in the field.

In 2022, Church appeared as &quot;Mushroom&quot; on the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; and finished in second place.

The same year, Church had a brief cameo in the seventh episode of the TV series &quot;Welcome to Wrexham&quot;, in which she was interviewed by Wrexham A.F.C. co-owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney before singing Wrexham&#x27;s team anthem and the Welsh National Anthem.

==Writing==
Church released an autobiography titled &quot;Voice of an Angel (My Life So Far)&quot; in October 2000, aged 14. She released a second autobiography titled &quot;Keep Smiling&quot; in late 2007.

In 2019, Church authored several opinion pieces for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Political activities==
Church gave BBC 6 Music&#x27;s John Peel Lecture at The Lowry in Salford in 2013, in which she criticised the music industry for what she described as a culture of sexism that pressures female artists to project a sexualised image of themselves.

Following Church&#x27;s appearance at the Leveson Inquiry, she became increasingly outspoken on a number of political issues, which she has explained as growing out of her experience of Leveson, as well as the Conservative victory in the 2015 general election. She is a member of the media campaigning group Hacked Off.

In May 2015, she joined a demonstration organised by the People&#x27;s Assembly Against Austerity in Cardiff, subsequently addressing a crowd of 250,000 at a People&#x27;s Assembly march in London the following month. In September 2015, she endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election, In 2016, Church, along with other celebrities, toured the UK to support Corbyn&#x27;s bid to become Prime Minister, and in March 2016, performed at a socialist fundraising event in Edinburgh for Corbyn.

At the 2015 Glastonbury Festival, she chaired a conversation with two members of Russian feminist punk band Pussy Riot.

In August 2015 she performed the song &quot;This Bitter Earth&quot; outside the Shell Centre in London as part of a month-long protest organised by Greenpeace against Shell&#x27;s pursuit of petroleum exploration in the Arctic.

In May 2016, she declared her support for the Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, in the National Assembly for Wales election. Church is a supporter of Welsh independence, performing at a pro-independence concert in 2019.

In January 2017, she took part in a protest in Cardiff about Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration as US president.

In February 2024, she was recorded singing in support of Palestine, in the period following the Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip (2023–present) after the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel. She led a choir of about 100 people in a rendition of &quot;From the River to the Sea&quot;, a phrase commonly heard at pro-Palestinian marches, which led to accusations of antisemitism.

==Personal life==
Church&#x27;s personal life and relationships were reported on by UK tabloid newspapers, inspiring the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Be Alone&quot; on her album &quot;Tissues and Issues&quot; (2005).

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, when she was 15, Church was criticised for the remarks attributed to her by the &quot;New York Post&quot; in which she allegedly criticised &quot;the hero status afforded to New York firefighters&quot; in their aftermath. She apologised for the remarks a month later, as well as at the Leveson Inquiry in 2011, stating that her comments were taken out of context. In a 2006 interview with Davina McCall, Church agreed that being diplomatic was &quot;not in her nature&quot;.

In November 2011, Church testified before the Leveson Inquiry about the media intrusion into her personal life, stating &quot;I&#x27;ve been made a caricature for so long, and this person portrayed in the tabloids really isn&#x27;t me. It&#x27;s not the person I am, and it&#x27;s had a massive impact on my career. As an artist, I find it hard to be taken seriously because my credibility has been blown to bits.&quot;

In 2007, Church made another appearance on a British young people&#x27;s rich list with her then-boyfriend, Welsh rugby player Gavin Henson. They were ranked 49th-richest young people in Britain with an estimated joint wealth of £12 million.

On 27 February 2012, Church accepted £600,000 in damages and costs in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of the News International phone hacking scandal. News International&#x27;s owner, Rupert Murdoch, had convinced Church in 1999 to waive a performance fee in return for &quot;good press&quot;. She had claimed that 33 stories about her that appeared in the &quot;News of the World&quot; were the product of illegal hacking into her family&#x27;s voicemail. After the settlement was announced in open court, she made a lengthy statement in which she said, &quot;I have also discovered that despite the apology which the newspaper has just given in court, these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour [...]. In my opinion, they are not truly sorry, only sorry they got caught.&quot;

The press devoted much attention to Church&#x27;s relationship with her first boyfriend in 2002, model and musician Steve Johnson; her second boyfriend, Kyle Johnson (no relation), who was later jailed for possession of a large amount of heroin; and her third boyfriend Gavin Henson, whom she started dating in 2005. At the end of 2005, Church bought a property in her native Cardiff – for a reported £500,000 – which she later sold for £900,000. The couple then bought a manor with a 20-acre (8 hectare) small holding in the Vale of Glamorgan in the village of St Brides Major.

The couple had mentioned wanting to marry numerous times on talk shows and in the press; they became engaged in February 2010. Henson proposed to Church with a two-carat heart-shaped diamond ring in Cornwall. The couple announced their engagement six weeks later, in April 2010.

Church and Henson have two children. She gave birth to their daughter Ruby in September 2007, and to their son Dexter in January 2009. The couple separated in mid 2010.

Church met musician, &quot;Back to Scratch&quot; collaborator, and former employee of James and Maria Church, Jonathan Powell, at The Robin Hood pub in Canton, Cardiff.&lt;ref name=&quot;walesonline/1906185&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They began dating in late 2010. In June 2017, she suffered a miscarriage. On 4 October that year, Church and Powell secretly married at a register office in Cardiff, before blessing their marriage with an intimate ceremony in front of family and friends under a tree at their home in Twyncyn, Dinas Powys.

In 2019, Church founded The Awen Project, a life learning and educational charity with access to nature in a secluded environment, starting with an initial pupil roll ambition of up to 20 children.

Church and Powell had a daughter, Frida Simone, in August 2020. Church had originally planned to give birth under a tree in their garden, but as the weather changed they moved indoors. Church explained, &quot;I laboured under there overnight, which was beautiful, but then I had her screaming on the bathroom floor. Mother Nature came and went, &#x27;Sit down, silly lady.&#x27;...I live next to a golf course, and I could really hear the golfers. As my noise started to up, I thought, &#x27;This is not going to work.&#x27;&quot;

In 2021, Church bought Rhydoldog House, a mansion in the Elan Valley, near Rhaeadr, Powys, Wales,&lt;ref name=&quot;housebeautiful/a27330585&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shropshirestar/singer-bought-ashley&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational.wales/19812490&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as seen on &quot;Charlotte Church&#x27;s Dream Build&quot;.

In February 2022, Church was the subject of &quot;Kate Garraway&#x27;s Life Stories&quot;, revealing that she had made a decision to quit music in 2002. Church explained that her mother caught her smoking at home at the age of 16, whereupon Church moved out, &quot;cut the ties&quot;, and set up home independently, rebelling against the &quot;facade of the celebrity culture&quot;, as she wanted to experience normal teenage life. By 19, Church had resumed her career.

In 2023, Church listed Rhydoldog House for sale.

<text>Janet Vera Street-Porter (&quot;née&quot; Bull; born 27 December 1946) is an English broadcaster, journalist, writer, and media personality. She began her career in 1969 as a fashion writer and columnist at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and was later appointed fashion editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in 1971. In 1973, she co-presented a mid-morning radio show with Paul Callan on LBC.

Street-Porter began working on television at London Weekend Television in 1975, first as a presenter of a series of mainly youth-oriented programmes. She was the editor and producer of the &quot;Network 7&quot; series on Channel 4 in 1987, and served as a BBC Television executive from 1987 until 1994. She was an editor of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; from 1999 until 2002, but relinquished the job to become editor-at-large. 

Since 2011, Street-Porter has been a regular panellist on the ITV talk show &quot;Loose Women&quot;. Her other television appearances include &quot;Question Time&quot; (1998–2015), &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; (1996–2023), &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot; (2004), &quot;Deadline&quot; (2007), &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; (2013, 2020), and &quot;A Taste of Britain&quot; (2014).

Street-Porter was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to journalism and broadcasting.

==Early life==
Street-Porter was born in Brentford, Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Hounslow). She is the daughter of Stanley W. G. Bull, an electrical engineer who had served as a sergeant in the Royal Corps of Signals in the Second World War, and Cherry Cuff Ardern (née Jones), who was Welsh and worked as a school dinner lady and in the civil service as a clerical assistant in a tax office. Street-Porter is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and considers herself nonreligious. Her mother was still married to her first husband, George Ardern, at the time, and was not to marry Stanley until 1954, hence Street-Porter&#x27;s name being recorded thus in the birth records. She was later to take her father&#x27;s surname.

Street-Porter grew up in Fulham, West London, and Perivale, Middlesex; the family moved there when she was 14. They stayed in her mother&#x27;s home town of Llanfairfechan in North Wales for their holidays. Street-Porter attended Peterborough Primary and Junior Schools in Fulham and Lady Margaret Grammar School for Girls (now Lady Margaret School) in Parsons Green from 1958 to 1964, where she passed 8 O-levels and 3 A-levels in English, History and Art. She also took an A-level in pure mathematics, but did not pass the exam. Whilst studying for her A-levels, she had an illegal abortion. She then spent two years at the Architectural Association School of Architecture, where she met her first husband, photographer Tim Street-Porter.

==Career==
Street-Porter began her career as a fashion writer and columnist on the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, and was appointed as the newspaper&#x27;s deputy fashion editor in 1969 by Shirley Conran. She subsequently became fashion editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; in 1971. When the London Broadcasting Company (LBC) local radio station began to broadcast in 1973, Street-Porter co-presented a mid-morning show with Fleet Street columnist Paul Callan. The intention was sharply to contrast the urbane Callan and the urban Street-Porter. Their respective accents became known to the station&#x27;s studio engineers as &quot;cut-glass&quot; and &quot;cut-froat&quot;. Friction between the ill-matched pair involved constant one-upmanship.

In early 1975, Street-Porter was launch editor of &quot;Sell Out&quot;, an offshoot of the London listings magazine &quot;Time Out&quot;, with its publisher and her second husband, Tony Elliott. The magazine was not a success.

===Television===

Street-Porter began to work in television at London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1975, first as a reporter on a series of mainly youth-oriented programmes, including &quot;The London Weekend Show&quot; (1975–79), then went on to present the late-night chat show &quot;Saturday Night People&quot; (1978–80) with Clive James and Russell Harty. She later produced &quot;Twentieth Century Box&quot; (1980–82), presented by Danny Baker.

Street-Porter was editor of the &quot;Network 7&quot; series on Channel 4 from 1987. In the same year, BBC Two controller Alan Yentob appointed her to become head of youth and entertainment features, making her responsible for the twice-weekly &quot;DEF II&quot;. She commissioned &quot;Rapido&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and &quot;Rough Guide&quot;. She was responsible for the cancellation of the long-running music series &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;. Her &quot;Network 7&quot; show was awarded a BAFTA for its graphics in 1988.

In 1992, Street-Porter provided the story for &quot;The Vampyr: A Soap Opera&quot;, the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of Heinrich August Marschner&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Vampyr&quot;, which featured a new libretto by Charles Hart. Street-Porter&#x27;s approach did not endear her to critics, who objected to her diction and questioned her suitability as an influence on Britain&#x27;s youth. In her final year at the BBC, she became head of independent commissioning. She left the BBC for Mirror Group Newspapers in 1994 to become joint-managing director, with Kelvin MacKenzie, of the ill-fated L!VE TV channel. She left in October 1995, four months after L!ve had begun broadcasting. In 1996, Street-Porter established her own production company. Since that year, Street-Porter has appeared several times on the BBC panel show &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, most recently in December 2023. From 1998 until 2015 (except 2013), Street-Porter appeared annually on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; television series.

In 2000, Street-Porter was nominated for the Mae West Award for the Most Outspoken Woman in the Industry at Carlton Television&#x27;s Women in Film and Television Awards. In 2007, Street-Porter starred in an ITV2 reality show, &quot;Deadline&quot;, serving as a tough-talking editor who worked with a team of celebrity &quot;reporters&quot; whose job it was to produce a weekly gossip magazine. She decided each week which of them to fire.

In 2011, Street-Porter became a regular panellist on ITV&#x27;s chat show &quot;Loose Women&quot;. In 2013, she appeared in &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot; reaching the final three, and returned again for a Christmas special in 2020, in which she was crowned the winner. She also appeared on the television show &quot;QI&quot;. Since 1 September 2014, Street-Porter has co-hosted BBC One cookery programme &quot;A Taste of Britain&quot; with chef Brian Turner, which ran for 20 episodes in one series.

Street-Porter has appeared on many reality TV shows, including &quot;Call Me a Cabbie&quot; and &quot;So You Think You Can Teach&quot;; the latter saw her trying to work as a primary school teacher. She conducted numerous interviews with business figures and others for Bloomberg Television.

===Newspaper work===
Street-Porter became editor of &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; in 1999. Despite derision from her critics, she took the paper&#x27;s circulation up to 270,460, an increase of 11.6 per cent. In 2001, Street-Porter became its editor-at-large, as well as writing a weekly column and regular features.

===Editor-at-large column===
Following the death of Ian Tomlinson, Street-Porter dedicated her editor-at-large column in &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; to painting a picture of Tomlinson as a &quot;troubled man with quite a few problems&quot;:Knowing that he was an alcoholic is critical to understanding his sense of disorientation and his attitude towards the police, which might on first viewing of the video footage, seem a bit stroppy.

===Other activities===
A rambler, Street-Porter was president of the Ramblers&#x27; Association for two years from 1994. She walked across Britain from Dungeness in Kent to Conwy in Wales for the television series &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; in 1998. Street-Porter also walked from Edinburgh to London in a straight line in 1998, for a television series and her book, &quot;As the Crow Flies&quot;. In 1994, for the documentary series &quot;The Longest Walk&quot;, Street-Porter visited long-distance walker Ffyona Campbell on the last section of her round-the-world walk.

In 1966, Street-Porter appeared as an extra in the nightclub scene in &quot;Blowup&quot;, dancing in a silver coat and striped trousers. In 2003, she wrote and presented a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Festival titled &quot;All the Rage&quot;. She published the autobiographical &quot;Baggage&quot; in 2004, about her childhood in working class London. Its sequel is titled &quot;Fallout&quot;. &quot;Life&#x27;s Too F***ing Short&quot; is a volume which presents, as she puts it, her answer to &quot;getting what you want out of life by the most direct route.&quot;

==Personal life==

While studying architecture she married fellow student and photographer Tim Street-Porter. They were together until 1975 when she went on to marry &quot;Time Out&quot; editor Tony Elliott. Her third marriage was to film director Frank Cvitanovich, who was 19 years her senior, before her final brief marriage in her fifties to 27-year-old David Sorkin. Before marrying Sorkin, she lived with DEF II presenter Normski for four years.

Since 1999, she has been in a relationship with restaurateur Peter Spanton. She has no children. She currently lives in Haddiscoe in Norfolk, as well as in Kent and London. She previously had a home in Nidderdale, North Yorkshire. An active member of the Nidderdale community, she contributed her time and energy to a number of local causes. She was the president of the Burley Bridge Association, leading a campaign for a crossing over the River Wharfe, linking North and West Yorkshire.

===Health===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Street-Porter regularly appeared as a guest on &quot;This Morning&quot; to review the political decisions taken by the government, alongside Matthew Wright, via video call from her home in Kent.

Street-Porter was diagnosed with basal-cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer, in January 2020. On 23 June 2020, she announced the news on &quot;Loose Women&quot; (from home, via video call, owing to COVID-19 restrictions).

<text>A Falseta is part of Flamenco music. They are usually short melodies played by the guitarist(s) in between sung verses, or to accompany dancers. In a guitar solo, the artists play already created falsetas or improvise new falsetas which are then put together to form the whole piece. A falseta can be roughly comparable to a lick in jazz or blues music.

==Examples==

The Soleares, Alegrias and other palos could be explained as one measure of 6/8 time and one measure of 3/4 time, although changes of harmony tend to accent the third and tenth beat, avoiding the Western Classical idea of downbeat, and therefore further obscure the unfamiliar listener&#x27;s ability to sense the beginning and middle of the cycle. As this musical tendency would be common for them, their sense of rhythmic emphasis would naturally be obscured.

 [12] 1 2 [3] 4 5 [6] 7 [8] 9 [10] 11

The Siguiriyas is the same pattern as the Soleares, but shifted:

 [12] 1 [2] 3 [4] 5 6 [7] 8 9 [10] 11

Although many performers will count it as follows:

 1 and 2 and 3 and a 4 and a 5 and

The Farrucas, are 2 measures of 4/4 time, the falsetas each having of 8 beats:

 [1] 2 [3] 4 [5] 6 [7] 8

Most other forms follow these two basic rhythms, though there can be considerable variation, such as in the Granaína.

<doc id="462504" wikidata="Q334191" url="?curid=462504" title="Matthew Parris">
<text>Matthew Francis Parris (born 7 August 1949) is a British political writer, broadcaster, and former politician. He served as Member of Parliament for West Derbyshire from 1979 to 1986. Ideologically a liberal conservative, he is a member of the Conservative Party.

Parris was born in South Africa to British parents. He subsequently studied at Clare College, Cambridge, and Yale University before working for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and then the Conservative Research Department. He entered parliament in 1979 and remained there until 1986, resigning to pursue a journalistic career as presenter of the television series &quot;Weekend World&quot;. After the series ended in 1988, he became a freelance columnist for &quot;The Times&quot;. Having spoken out for gay rights throughout the 1980s, in 1989 he was a founding member of the gay rights charity Stonewall.

During the 1990s, Parris&#x27; columns began being collected together for book publication and in 2002 he published his autobiography. His political column proved influential, described as being widely regarded as essential reading among the political class in Westminster. By the 2010s and 2020s he was more openly critical of some of the groups he had been affiliated with, criticising Conservative leaders Boris Johnson and Liz Truss as well as Stonewall&#x27;s move to include trans rights in its remit. In 2024, he ended his Saturday political column in &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Parris was born in Johannesburg, South Africa. He is the eldest of six children (including three brothers and two sisters) and grew up in several British territories and former territories: South Africa, Cyprus, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Swaziland (now Eswatini) and Jamaica, where his father was working as an electrical engineer. His parents ended up working and living in Catalonia, Spain, where Parris later bought a house.

At the age of 19, Parris drove across Africa to Europe in a Morris Oxford; the trip was traumatically punctuated when, he reports in his 2002 autobiography, he and his female companion were attacked, and he was forced to witness her rape.

He later attributed his embrace of conservatism to an early reading of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot;: &quot;An admiration for [the pigs&#x27;] intelligence and sense of order dawned in me. I never liked them, but their final triumph taught me that idealism is not enough.&quot;

Parris was educated at Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa, an independent school just outside Mbabane in Swaziland, Sessions School on the island of Cyprus, and Clare College, Cambridge, where he gained a first class degree in law and was a member of the Liberal Club. He won a Paul Mellon scholarship and studied international relations at Yale University. At Yale, he failed to receive his Master of Arts degree, later blaming &quot;too much coffee, Four Roses bourbon, train training to break a five-minute mile and hanging out with interesting people.&quot; It was at the university that he befriended Peter Ackroyd.

==Early and parliamentary career==
Parris was offered a job as an MI6 officer, but instead worked for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for two years. In 1976, he left this career because he did not like its formality, and because he wanted to become a Member of Parliament. He eventually joined the Conservative Research Department and moved on to become correspondence secretary to Margaret Thatcher.

In the late 1970s, he was awarded an RSPCA medal — presented by Thatcher, then Leader of the Opposition) — for jumping into the River Thames to rescue a dog. He later attributed that incident for the party&#x27;s decision to select him as a parliamentary candidate.

Parris was the Conservative MP for the parliamentary constituency of West Derbyshire from 1979 to 1986. Competing prospective candidates for the seat included Peter Lilley and Michael Howard. He voiced support for gay rights. Parris left politics to pursue a career in journalism. While a politician he wrote a few newspaper columns; one, &quot;Stop being Beastly to Tatchell&quot; for &quot;The Times&quot;, complained about homophobic tactics used against Peter Tatchell in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election.

==Radio and television==
Parris is now a radio and television presenter, &quot;The Times&quot; columnist, and pundit. As an MP he took part in a &quot;World in Action&quot; documentary during 1984 requiring him to live in Newcastle for a week on £26.80, the then state social security payment set for a single adult by the government he supported as a Conservative. The experiment came to an embarrassing end when he ran out of money for the electricity meter. Twenty years later, in 2004, he attempted the experiment again for the documentary &quot;For the Benefit of Mr Parris, Revisited&quot;.

Parris resigned as an MP by applying for the Crown position of Steward of the Manor of Northstead and left Parliament specifically to take over from Brian Walden as host of ITV&#x27;s influential Sunday lunchtime current-affairs series &quot;Weekend World&quot; in 1986. The series, broadcast since 1977 with Walden at its helm, ran for two more years under Parris before being cancelled in 1988.

He presents BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Great Lives&quot; biography series, and has appeared on the satirical news programme &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and presented &quot;After Dark&quot;. In 2007, Parris presented two light-hearted but caustic documentaries for Radio 4 on politicians&#x27; use of cliché and jargon, entitled &quot;Not My Words, Mr Speaker&quot;.

On 8 July 2011, on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions?&quot;, at the height of the furore surrounding the alleged illegal and corrupt activities of &quot;News of the World&quot; journalists, Parris eulogised the newspaper and gave an enthusiastic appreciation of what he considered the virtues and positive achievements of Rupert Murdoch.

In December 2017 Parris appeared, in a cameo role, in the Anniversary edition of BBC&#x27;s &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;.

==Writing and journalism==

Parris is a prolific writer and has written many books on politics and travel. In 1991, a compilation of his pieces in &quot;The Times&quot; appeared, entitled &quot;So Far, So Good&quot;. Since then there have been further compilations. &quot;Scorn&quot;, a book he has edited of quotations about curses, jibes and general invective, was published in October 1994. He has achieved continuing success as a parliamentary reporter and columnist through his knowledge and understanding of politicians and ability to write well about them. He worked as parliamentary sketch writer for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper from 1988 to 2001 and has had weekly columns in &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Spectator&quot; magazine. In 2004, Parris became Writer of the Year in Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; Awards. In part, this was for reporting on elections in Iraq and Afghanistan. His previous accolades include Columnist of the Year in the 1991 and 1993 British Press Awards, and in the &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; Awards 1992. In 1990 he received the London Press Club&#x27;s Edgar Wallace Outstanding Reporter of the Year Award.

In 2002, his autobiography, &quot;Chance Witness: An Outsider&#x27;s Life in Politics&quot;, was published by Viking. In 2005, he published &quot;A Castle in Spain&quot; about his family&#x27;s project to refurbish a derelict sixteenth-century mansion, L&#x27;Avenc, in Catalonia, close to the foothills of the Pyrenees, and make his home there.

In 2011, &quot;Total Politics&quot; said that Parris&#x27;s column &quot;is considered essential reading by many in Westminster. He has a penchant for holding opinions that go against the grain. Parris has written scathingly about the localism agenda, and was a long-time defender of PMQs, although he recently changed his mind.&quot;

Parris&#x27;s writing has often attracted wider comment. For example, in a 2007 article in &quot;The Times&quot; he wrote a satirical article which stated, &quot;A festive custom we could do worse than foster would be stringing piano wire across country lanes to decapitate cyclists&quot;, which attracted two hundred letters to the Press Complaints Commission Parris issued an apology: &quot;I offended many with my Christmas attack on cyclists. It was meant humorously but so many cyclists have taken it seriously that I plainly misjudged. I am sorry.&quot; In the same year Alastair Campbell called Parris &quot;a little shit&quot; in his diaries, to which Parris responded &quot;I&#x27;d rather be a little shit than a big cunt&quot;.

Parris criticised the initial 2015 leadership election for the Labour Party, referring to recent rule changes that allowed any individual who donated £3 to the Labour Party to vote in the leadership elections. Following a second leadership election, which incumbent leader Jeremy Corbyn won with an increased majority, Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said that Parris and Michael Dobbs commented that Corbyn&#x27;s reelection &quot;will break the Labour Party&quot;.

A co-founder of the gay rights charity Stonewall, Parris has criticised the organisation for latterly adopting trans rights as part of its agenda, writing that trans issues are unrelated to gay rights and should be for a separate organisation.

In May 2021, Parris called for the removal of ethnic minority status from Gypsy, Roma and Travellers, describing them &quot;not a race, but a doomed mindset&quot; and called for &quot;a gradual but relentless squeeze on anyone who tries without permission to park their home on public property or the property of others&quot;. The anti-racism group Hope not Hate responded to Parris saying &quot;The Times have published an article advocating for eradicating the way of life of an entire ethnic minority. Absolutely shameful. Solidarity with Gypsy, Roma and Traveller people who have to endure this racism, and this mindset.&quot;

In June 2021, Parris argued there was &quot;an absolute problem with human rights&quot; and wrote a column whose &quot;aim is to question the whole concept of fundamental human rights. It is so deeply flawed as to be fatal to all reasoning built upon it.&quot;

In his writing, Parris proved critical of several Conservative leaders. In June 2020 Parris wrote an excoriating article on Boris Johnson saying, &quot;He never had any judgment or strategic vision. Mr Johnson was only ever a shallow opportunist with a minor talent to amuse&quot;. In 2022, Parris described Liz Truss as &quot;a planet-sized mass of overconfidence and ambition teetering upon a pinhead of a political brain&quot;.

In July 2024, a few weeks short of his 75th birthday, Parris stopped writing his long-running Saturday opinion column in &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he mostly commented on British politics. He continues to write his diary column for the newspaper, which appears on Wednesdays.

===Travel writing===
Parris has made several expeditions abroad. They include Mount Kilimanjaro in 1967 and in 1989; Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1973; the Sahara in 1978; Peru; Bolivia. In 1990 he published &quot;Inca-Kola&quot; about his travels in Peru.

He spent the Antarctic winter of 2000 on the French possession of Grande Terre, part of the Kerguelen Archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a few dozen over-winterers, mostly researchers. One of them was fatally shot in an accident during his stay, about which he wrote for &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ideologically, in 2024 Parris described himself as inclining towards liberal conservatism.

Parris claims he attempted to out himself in a late-night debate in the House of Commons in 1984, but nobody noticed. He announced that he was gay in one of his weekly newspaper columns and admitted that he cruised Clapham Common for sex.
In an interview on &quot;Newsnight&quot;, during the Ron Davies scandal of 1998, he told Jeremy Paxman that there were two gay members of the then Labour Cabinet, one being Peter Mandelson. He has stated that there are between 30 and 60 unannounced gay members of the British Parliament.

In August 2006 Parris entered into a civil partnership with his long-term partner, Julian Glover, a speechwriter for David Cameron and a former political journalist at &quot;The Guardian&quot;. At the time of their partnership, they had been together for 11 years.

Parris owns homes in Spain, Derbyshire (where he keeps pet alpacas) and the Docklands in East London. He is the honorary patron of Clare Politics, a student-run politics society at Clare College, Cambridge. He was a keen marathon runner, taking part in the London Marathon several times. His personal best was 2:32:57, achieved in 1985 at the age of 35, a record which &quot;Total Politics&quot; in 2018 said &quot;looks unlikely to be smashed any time soon&quot;; John Lamont, the fastest of 15 MPs in the marathon that year, finished at 3:38:03. Parris decided that he wanted to go out on top, and arguing that serious running is not good for one&#x27;s health, he stopped running marathons after that. No British MP, sitting or retired, has bettered Parris&#x27; marathon-running time.

==Reception and influence==

In October 2017, the commentator Iain Dale placed Parris at Number 84 in his list of &#x27;The Top 100 Most Influential People on the Right&#x27;, describing him as &quot;the pre-eminent columnist of his generation&quot;.
In August 2010, in a list compiled by the &quot;Independent on Sunday&quot;, Parris was voted the 49th most influential LGBT person in Britain.

<text>Weet-Bix is a whole-grain wheat breakfast cereal created and manufactured in Australia and New Zealand by the Sanitarium Health Food Company, and in South Africa by Bokomo.

== History ==
Weet-Bix was developed by Bennison Osborne in Sydney, Australia, in the mid-1910s. Osborne set out to make a product more palatable than Granose, a biscuit that was marketed by the Sanitarium Health Food Company at that time. On 19 August 1926, he lodged an application for registration of the trademark Weet-Bix, a name which he had devised.

Production began at 659 Parramatta Road, Leichhardt, under the management of Osborne, and with the financial backing of Arthur Shannon, who created the company Grain Products to manufacture the cereal. Osborne&#x27;s friend, Malcolm Ian Macfarlane, from New Zealand, joined him to take on a marketing role. The product was so successful that, in October 1928, Shannon sold the rights in the product to the Australasian Conference Association Limited (Sanitarium Health Food Company, a wholly owned subsidiary and venture of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Australia).

Macfarlane suggested that they ship the product to New Zealand, where it proved so successful that it became difficult to adequately supply the market from Australia. Osborne and MacFarlane went to New Zealand and established factories in Auckland and Christchurch. However, once again, Shannon sold out to the Australasian Conference Association Limited.

Osborne and Macfarlane then exported the product to South Africa and, with Shannon&#x27;s financial backing, went to that country and built a factory in Cape Town, with Osborne managing sales. That enterprise was also sold subsequently, this time to Bokomo. While in South Africa, Osborne and Macfarlane sought to obtain more satisfactory financial backing to secure Osborne&#x27;s product. A group was formed, Osborne refined the product, and he and Macfarlane went to England to establish the product there.

The British &amp; African Cereal Company, Ltd. was registered in London in 1932, as a private company, with the proprietor shown as Weetabix Limited of Weetabix Mills, Kettering. All shares in the company were specified to be under the control of the directors, the first of whom were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm Ian Macfarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton. For the purpose of legally differentiating the product from that sold in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, the product was named Weetabix.

Osborne and Macfarlane became the joint managing directors with Osborne controlling production and Macfarlane controlling marketing. Sites for the factory were examined, with Burton Latimer in Northamptonshire eventually being chosen, due in part to the offer of a disused flour mill by a Mr. George, who requested shares in the company and who was subsequently offered a seat on the existing board of directors. In 1933, Macfarlane left the company to pursue other business interests, leaving Osborne as the sole managing director. George eventually became chairman of the board. Osborne sold his shareholding to the directors in July 1936, at which time the company was renamed Weetabix Limited.

At that time, Osborne established a Weetabix factory in the US, at Clinton, Massachusetts. However, the venture was unsuccessful, and Weetabix eventually entered the US market from Canada via Clinton, the site of the original US factory.

Weet-Bix Clusters are to be discontinued by June 2025. 

==Gluten Free Weet-Bix==
In July 2014, Sanitarium introduced gluten-free Weet-Bix, produced from sorghum grains. Earlier in 2014, the company had recommissioned their Perth-based Weet-Bix factory into a dedicated gluten-free manufacturing facility to produce this new product.

==Weet-Bix Bites==
Sanitarium introduced Weet-Bix™ Bites in 2012 as a bite-sized version of the popular breakfast cereal. It is a wheat-based cereal infused with fruit and honey. As of 2024, Weet-Bix Bites are available in four varieties: apricot, wild berry, honey crunch, and, most recently, coco crunch.

==Brand popularity==

Weet-Bix is seen in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa as an iconic national foodstuff. An online poll of 16,000 people in 2006 identified it as Australia&#x27;s favourite trademark. The product has been marketed in Australia since 1985 with the catchphrase &quot;Aussie kids are Weet-Bix kids&quot;. Based on its success in Australia, a similar catchphrase was adopted six months later in New Zealand: &quot;Kiwi Kids are Weet-Bix kids&quot;.

==Weet-Bix cards==
Sanitarium started to issue collectors&#x27; cards in 1942 as a marketing device in their boxes of Weet-Bix and for some of their other breakfast cereal products, including Granose, Bixies, Cerix and later Puffed Wheat, Puffed Rice, Weeta Puffs, Weeta Flakes and Corn Flakes. Sanitarium have also issued cards in their New Zealand products, sometimes similar to the Australian series but also series with a New Zealand focus such as the All Blacks (New Zealand Rugby team) –themed &quot;Stat Attack&quot; cards.

<text>Alvinella pompejana, the Pompeii worm, is a species of deep-sea polychaete worm (commonly referred to as &quot;bristle worms&quot;). It is an extremophile found only at hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean, discovered in the early 1980s off the Galápagos Islands by French marine biologists.

==Introduction==
In 1980 Daniel Desbruyères and Lucien Laubier, just a few years after the discovery of the first hydrothermal vent system, identified one of the most heat-tolerant animals on Earth — &quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot;, the Pompeii worm. It was described as a deep-sea polychaete that resides in tubes near hydrothermal vents, along the seafloor. In 1997, marine biologist Craig Cary and colleagues found the same worms in a new section of Pacific Ocean, near Costa Rica, also attached to hydrothermal vents. The new discovery and subsequent work led to important progress in the scientific knowledge of these special worms.

They can reach up to in length and are pale gray, with red tentacle-like gills on their heads. Perhaps most fascinating, their tail ends are often resting in temperatures as high as , while their feather-like heads stick out of the tubes into water that is much cooler, . Scientists are attempting to understand how Pompeii worms can withstand such extreme temperatures by studying the bacteria that form a &quot;fleece-like&quot; covering on their backs. The bacteria have also been discovered to be chemolithotrophic, contributing to the ecology of the vent community. Recent research suggests the bacteria might play an important role in the feeding of the worms.

Attaching themselves to black smokers, the worms have been found to thrive at sustained temperatures of from and even for a short time, making the Pompeii worm the most heat-tolerant complex animal known to science after the tardigrades (or water bears), which are able to survive temperatures over 150 °C.

==Biology==
Reaching a length of up to , Pompeii worms have &quot;hairy&quot; backs; these &quot;hairs&quot; are actually colonies of bacteria such as &quot;Nautilia profundicola&quot;, which are thought to afford the worm some degree of insulation. Glands on the worm&#x27;s back secrete a mucus on which the bacteria feed, a form of symbiosis. The Pompeii worms form large, aggregate colonies enclosed in long tubes.

&quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot; has relatively simple organ systems centering around its rod-like heart. Its outermost organ is the gills along its feather-shaped head, four external gills present as leaf-like structures with a red colour due to their hemoglobin. The heart provides blood to these organs using contractions, pushing blood along the dorsal and ventral vessels. Beneath the heart lies the animal&#x27;s stomach which connects to an oesophagus that is used to consume food. Finally, surrounding the organs is a coelom filled with coelomocytes, a type of phagocyte that acts as an immune system for the animal.

The Pompeii worm feeds upon chemosynthetic bacteria, using retractable, ciliated feeding tentacles to scoop them up or absorbing their organic matter within the hydrothermal vent fluid. These tentacles are coated with 4 types of secretory cells along the entire epidermis. The tentacle&#x27;s muscle cells seem to be filled with homogenous blood cells and individual hat-shaped cells, the hat-shaped cells have a condensed nucleus and it is hypothesised that these are heavily modified sperm cells.

The gills of &quot;A. pompejana&quot; are pinnate with many thin outgrowths. This organ is ultrastructurally similar to the gills of &quot;terebellidae&quot; and the epidermis is irregularly folded inwards. This gives the blood access to a space very close to the skin of &quot;A. pompejana&quot;, thus allowing more effective oxygen diffusion. Secretory cells of the goblet type have also been observed, along with hairlike receptor cells known as bipolar ciliary receptor cells. It is important to note that the Pompeii worm&#x27;s epibiotic bacteria are absent from both the gills and tentacles.

== Physiology ==
&quot;Alvinella pompejana&#x27;s&quot; blood is abnormally cool at 20-30 °C. This is due to their blood&#x27;s high positive cooperativity at these temperatures, thus haemoglobin is more likely to gain oxygen, an essential feature in an environment with sparse oxygen levels. Additionally, &quot;A. pompejana&#x27;s&quot; gills have the highest specific surface area of any polychaete and small diffusion distances between the circulatory system and external seawater further assist in oxygenation.

&quot;Alvinellidae&quot; have an exceptionally high congenital oxygen affinity, in addition to a high heat requirement for oxygenation (𝚫H). Therefore, to allow adequate release of oxygen within the body, the Pompeii worm has acidic blood with a pH range of 6.6-6.9. A lower pH decreases the energy required to unbind oxygen from haemoglobin by utilising the Bohr effect. The effect gradually compounds as the haemoglobin&#x27;s 4 O2 binding sites are emptied, it is maximal when the haemoglobin is fully deoxygenated. As a result, they can release all possible oxygen without expending excessive energy. To further compound this, &quot;A. pompejana&#x27;s&quot; vascular haemoglobin has a lower oxygen affinity when compared to coelomic haemoglobin. When it is time to rebind oxygen to the haemoglobin, the blood must be cooled to 20-30 °C to regain optimal cooperativity. However, hydrothermal vents reach much higher temperatures. This makes the low blood temperature strange and seemingly hard to maintain.

The current hypothesis is that the polychaete worm maintains an “external microenvironment” that does not exceed this 20-30 °C limit, possibly through cold water being pulled into the tube during the worms repeated exit and entry in addition to the bacteria circulating this water around the worms body. This is supported by evidence that &quot;A. pompejana&#x27;s&quot; mitochondria break down when 30 °C is exceeded. Despite this the worm still manages to live in vents that exceed 50 °C. Furthermore, an inverse relationship is drawn between 𝚫H value and the temperature range of an environment; a higher 𝚫H means a habitat has a smaller range of temperatures with fewer fluctuations. As &quot;A. pompejana&quot; has a high 𝚫H it is reasonable to theorise that their habitable temperature range is quite small with few fluctuations.

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot; are a gonochoric species with distinct differences between the male and female genital pores (located at the base of the gills). Males have a pair of tentacles near the mouth that are absent in females. However, females possess a genital tract consisting of oviducts and spermathecae. The exact method of reproduction is unknown but it is believed that it is a complex multi-step process. However, it is known that the Pompeii worm&#x27;s habitat rapidly changes and is extremely unstable, and thus their reproduction has adapted accordingly.

The size of the female oocytes suggests that the embryo is lecithotrophic meaning the only nutrition is within the yolk of the egg. Prior to fertilisation these oocytes are flattened spheres with an undulating membrane and a slightly off centre germinal vesicle that is less dense than the surrounding cytoplasm. Upon dilution in seawater, they become spherical and the GV disappears, at this point the whole oocyte appears homogeneous. This process does not require sperm.

The current hypothesis for egg synthesis and spawning is as follows: first the yolk is formed through a long process within the animal&#x27;s coelom, next, the mature eggs are stored and finally, the eggs are spawned when either an environmental or biological change occurs (eg. sperm transfer). The method for transfer of spermatozoa it is likely achieved through pseudo-copulatory behaviour as the worms have been observed diving head-first into tubes in a display that may be mating.

When it is deemed appropriate to fertilise the eggs they are seemingly selected based upon size and then individually passed through the spermathecae. This method of fertilisation is more efficient than having all eggs be passed through at once.

Between 30 minutes and several hours after fertilisation has been achieved, the fertilisation envelope progressively elevates. This begins at a single point along the periphery of the oocyte. Then, prior to the first cleavage, a polar lobe forms thus resulting in asymmetrical cleavages. The diameter ratio between the asymmetrical blastomeres remains fairly constant (1:1.5) with &quot;4 cell&quot; embryos typically possessing 1 cell bigger than the other 3. This is a similar to the pattern observed in other polychaetes.

== Early development ==
Although &quot;in situ&quot; observations are yet to be made of &quot;Alvinella pompejana&#x27;s&quot; early development, experiments have been conducted in order to hypothesise the embryonic and early stages of this polychaete&#x27;s life.

Embryos of the Pompeii worm are unable to tolerate both low and high temperatures, only developing in temperatures higher than 2 °C and lower than 20 °C. At 2 °C, the temperature of the abyssal sea, embryos enter a state of arrested development and at 20 °C the embryos die. Thus, they must not develop in hydrothermal vent colonies as temperatures much higher than 20 °C are achieved in this habitat.

Both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in situ&quot; incubation supported the hypothesis that embryonic development within an adult colony is impossible. To test their theory, researchers placed embryos in 3 areas, (I1) at the base of the chimney, (I2) in a &quot;Riftia pachyptila&quot; colony and (I3) in an adult colony. Results are presented in the below table with the highest survival and development rate coming from the (I1) and (I2) placements. It is also important to note that although the max temperature directly next to the (I3) incubator was 17 °C, temperatures as high as 27 °C were recorded 20 cm away.

After considering all results, as well as prior studies, it was concluded that the 3 most likely hypotheses are as follows.

# Embryos develop within a Riftia pachyptila colony (often near hydrothermal vents)
# Embryos develop at the base of hydrothermal chimneys
# Embryos enter a state of arrest and float in the abyssal column until a warm environment is found before resuming development (this would allow the dispersal of the species)
However, new evidence of an ecosystem underneath hydrothermal vents has suggested that the worm larvae may instead travel underground to colonise new vent systems.

== Tubes ==
The Pompeii worm is known for the tubes that it inhabits. Further research has uncovered that these tubes are unusually stable glycoprotein structures with high sulfur levels. Their construction was originally unknown but it is now hypothesised that the structure is made from a secretion from the epidermis of &quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot;. The fibril layers of the tubing are layered in a similar manner to plywood with each layer being slightly random. Within these tubes a layer of filamentous and rod-shaped bacteria are present, strangely these same bacteria can be found embedded within the walls of the tubes. It has been assumed that these are the bacteria that live in the worm&#x27;s tubing, they seem to become trapped when the mucus is secreted. Additionally bacteria have been found to be a source of elemental sulfur which explains the sulfur detected within their tube walls.

==Name==
Pompeii worms get their name from the Roman city of Pompeii that was destroyed during an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Its family name Alvinellidae and genus name &quot;Alvinella&quot; both derive from DSV &quot;Alvin&quot;, the three-person submersible vehicle used during the discovery of hydrothermal vents and their fauna during the late 1970s. The family Alvinellidae contains eight other species, but none matches the Pompeii worm&#x27;s heat tolerance.

==Symbiotic bacteria==
While it is not yet known precisely how the Pompeii worm survives these severe vent conditions, scientists suspect the answer lies in the fleece-like bacteria on the worm&#x27;s back; this layer may be up to 1 cm thick. The bacteria may possess special proteins, &quot;eurythermal enzymes&quot;, providing the bacteria—and by extension the worms—protection from a wide range of temperatures. Studies are hampered by the difficulties of sampling; It is currently quite difficult for Pompeii worms to survive decompression.

The bacteria are known to live in a mutualistic relationship with &quot;A. pompejana&quot;, making them both symbiotrophs. The main nutrition for the Pompeii worm is derived from chemosynthetic bacteria, this is why it chooses to live in such intense environments. This is due to the toxic metal levels of hydrothermal vent fluid, a factor chemosynthetic bacteria require. Unfortunately, the low pH, low oxygen levels and aforementioned metals within the fluid create an environment only fit for extremophiles; &quot;A. pompejana&quot; has physiological traits to assist in combating this but they are not enough. As a result, they have developed a strong relationship with the bacteria. The bacteria detoxify the fluid; this allows the worm to feed and live. Then, as the worm lives it respires, thus giving the bacteria a carbon source to feed upon. As an additional benefit, the bacteria gain shelter and surfaces to multiply upon due to the worm&#x27;s tubes.

Study of the Pompeii worm&#x27;s seemingly life-sustaining bacteria could lead to significant advances in the biochemical, pharmaceutical, textile, paper, and detergent industries.

==Behavior==
Pompeii worms simultaneously keep their heads (including the gills) in much cooler water while their tails are exposed to hot water. Since their internal temperature has yet to be measured, a Pompeii worm may survive exposure to hot water by dissipating heat through its head to keep its internal temperature within the realm previously known to be compatible with animal survival.

<text>A decongestant, or nasal decongestant, is a type of pharmaceutical drug that is used to relieve nasal congestion in the upper respiratory tract. The active ingredient in most decongestants is either pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine (the latter of which has disputed effectiveness). Intranasal corticosteroids can also be used as decongestants and antihistamines can be used to alleviate runny nose, nasal itch, and sneezing.

Topical decongestants on topical application as dilute solution (0.05–0.1%) produce local vasoconstriction.

Regular use of decongestants for long periods should be avoided because mucosal ciliary function is impaired: atrophic rhinitis and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) can occur due to persistent vasoconstriction.

Decongestants can be absorbed from the nose via an inhaler and produce systemic effects, mainly central nervous system stimulation and rise in blood pressure. These drugs should be used cautiously in hypertensives and in those receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as they can cause hypertensive crisis.

Expectorants such as guaifenesin are a related type of drug which help to clear mucus.

==Medical uses==
Decongestants are used to treat nasal congestion, for instance in allergies, infections like the common cold, influenza, and sinus infection, and nasal polyps. Decongestants are also used to reduce redness in the treatment of simple conjunctivitis.

A 2016 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to support the use of intranasal corticosteroids in the relief of common cold symptoms; however, the review was based on three trials and the quality of the evidence was regarded as very low.

==Pharmacology==
The vast majority of decongestants act via enhancing norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline) or adrenergic activity by stimulating the α1-adrenergic receptor since they mediate vasoconstriction and constricting nasal vasculature causes decongestion of nasal mucosa. This induces vasoconstriction of the blood vessels in the nose, throat, and paranasal sinuses, which results in reduced inflammation (swelling) and mucus formation in these areas.

Decongestant nasal sprays and eye drops often contain oxymetazoline and are used for topical decongestion. Pseudoephedrine acts indirectly on the adrenergic receptor system, whereas phenylephrine and oxymetazoline are direct agonists. The effects are not limited to the nose, and these medicines may cause hypertension (high blood pressure) through vasoconstriction; it is for this reason that people with hypertension are advised to avoid them. Most decongestants, however, are not pronounced stimulants, due to lack of response from the other adrenoreceptors. Besides hypertension, common side-effects include sleeplessness, anxiety, dizziness, excitability, and nervousness.

Topical nasal or ophthalmic decongestants quickly develop tachyphylaxis (&quot;a rapid decrease in the response to a drug after repeated doses over a short period of time&quot;). Long-term use is not recommended since these agents lose effectiveness after a few days.

<text>John Graham Kettley (born 11 July 1952 in Halifax, West Yorkshire) is a British freelance weather forecaster.

==Early life==
His father Harold lived at 75 Hollins Road in Walsden, the son of Fred Kettley. His father was a trumpet player in brass bands, playing with the band of the 10th Battalion Royal Army Ordnance Corps. His mother was Marion Greenwood. He was born at Halifax General Hospital, and lived at 35 Commercial Street.

He was educated at Todmorden Grammar School, gaining English Language, Art, Maths, Physics, and Chemistry O-levels in 1968. A geography teacher at his school sparked his interest in weather forecasting. He started Geography A-level, but never took the exam. In 1970 he gained A-levels in Maths and Physics.

His sister Susan was born on 6 June 1955 and went to the grammar school, where she threw the discus, acquiring 3 O-levels.

He played cricket for Burnley and Todmorden. By 1967 he played cricket for the local second XI team, mainly as a bowler, not a batsman.

He worked at the meteorological office at Manchester Airport for two years from 1970 before studying applied health and social care at what is now Coventry University, where he met his wife. He spent four years researching meteorology. He trained for a year in weather presentation at the Met Office College, Shinfield near Reading.

His parents moved to Smithy Bridge.

==Career==
From 1980, he worked at the Nottingham Weather Centre, presenting his first forecast for Radio Lincolnshire, then further forecasts for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Midlands Today&quot; (in the Nottingham news opt-out, starting 28 May 1980) and Central Television. In 1985, he became a national forecaster on the BBC. On Thursday 18 April 1991 he launched the first international weather forecast on the new BBC World Service Television.

===Radio===
Kettley used to work for the Met Office, and has previously presented weather for BBC Radio Five Live. Since October 2019, he has presented the weather forecasts during weekday breakfast on national rolling news radio station LBC News. On Tuesday 1 December 1998, he appeared on &quot;Radio Shuttleworth&quot; on Radio 4. He is now frequently heard presenting the weather forecasts on Boom Radio.

===Travel programmes===
He was a presenter on &quot;The Travel Show&quot; programme, from Thursday 18 June 1987, with Penny Junor, John Thirlwell and Matthew Collins. In May 1997, Kettley presented the &quot;Out and About&quot; walking programme.

===Commercial weather forecasting===
In 2000, Kettley left the Met Office to join commercial weather company British Weather Services, and continues to provide forecasts across a range of media outlets and sporting concerns including the Football Association, Twickenham and racecourses such as Newbury, Cheltenham, Haydock Park and Newmarket

==Personal life==
Kettley enjoys playing cricket, fell-walking and horse racing. A supporter of Burnley F.C., he often makes references to the team&#x27;s performances during broadcasts. He married Lynn in September 1990 in North Lincolnshire. His parents lived in Littleborough. He lived in Brinsley, when at Nottingham.

In 1988 he played cricket (as a bowler) for Ardeley in East Hertfordshire, where he lived.

He married graphic designer Lynn Grundy at St Andrew&#x27;s church in Kirton in Lindsey on 12 September 1990, with the service given by Rev Ian Walker. Kettley had known Grundy at his polytechnic, although she went later to the University of Leicester, and designed Ladybird Books in the mid-1980s; his wife had attended Brigg High School for Girls. They have two sons.

==Immortalised in verse==
Kettley&#x27;s status was confirmed in 1988, when a band called A Tribe of Toffs released the song &quot;John Kettley Is a Weatherman&quot;, which also made reference to other TV weather presenters of the day, including Michael Fish, Bernard Davey, Bill Giles, Ian McCaskill and Wincey Willis. The single reached number 21 in the UK Singles Chart. The song included the chorus:

:&quot;John Kettley is a weatherman&quot;
:&quot;A weatherman, a weatherman&quot;
:&quot;John Kettley is a weatherman&quot;
:&quot;And so is Michael Fish&quot;
:&quot;And so is Billy Giles&quot;
:&quot;And so is Ian McCaskill&quot;
:&quot;And so is Wincey Willis&quot;

<text>William Francis Deedes, Baron Deedes, (1 June 1913 – 17 August 2007) was a British Conservative politician, army officer and journalist. He was the first person in Britain to have been both a member of the Cabinet and the editor of a major daily newspaper, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

==Early life ==
Deedes was born in Hampstead in 1913, the second child and only son of landowner Herbert William Deedes and his wife Melesina Gladys, daughter of Philip Francis Chenevix Trench. His younger sister Margaret Melesina married the 21st Baron FitzWalter. He was brought up in the family home of Saltwood Castle until it was sold in 1925. He was educated at Harrow until after his father, who had struggled to manage the family&#x27;s wealth for years, suffered heavy financial losses from the Wall Street crash of 1929 which eradicated their remaining fortunes.

==Journalism==
Due to the lack of funds, Deedes was forced to leave school a year early and finish his exams with a tutor. After failing to get into a university, Deedes began his career as a reporter on the &quot;Morning Post&quot; in 1931, joining &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; when it took over the &quot;Post&quot; in 1937. Between 1931 and the beginning of the Second World War in 1939, he shared a home in Bethnal Green, with his uncle Wyndham Deedes.

==War Service==
Deedes fought with the British Army in the Second World War, being based initially at Shrapnel Barracks in Woolwich as an officer in the 2nd Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Westminsters, one of the Territorial Army (TA) units of the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps, into which he was commissioned in June 1939.

He gained the Military Cross near Hengelo, the Netherlands in April 1945. He rose to the rank of major and was the only officer to serve in 12th King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (2nd Queen&#x27;s Westminsters) for the duration of the war. His battalion served as the motorised battalion of 8th Armoured Brigade in the North-west Europe campaign.

==Politics==
Deedes came from a family with a tradition of public service. He was very proud of the fact that there had been a Deedes member of parliament in every century since 1600.

Deedes was elected as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Ashford in 1950. First serving as a junior minister under Winston Churchill for three years, he later entered Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Cabinet in 1962 as Minister without Portfolio. He left the Cabinet in 1964, as Minister of Information, and subsequently stood down as an MP at the October 1974 election.

==Editorship and Fleet Street==
Deedes was editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1974 to 1986 and, after he was replaced by Max Hastings, continued his career as a journalist. His tenure was noted for battles with the print unions.

After the 1999 Australian republic referendum, Deedes wrote in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;I have rarely attended elections in any country, certainly not a democratic one, in which the newspapers have displayed more shameless bias. One and all, they determined that Australians should have a republic and they used every device towards that end.&quot;

He continued to comment on social and political issues through his newspaper columns until his death. In his later years, he gained a cult fanbase after two memorable appearances on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and was, at the age of 88, the oldest guest ever to have appeared on the programme until 2012, when Baroness Trumpington appeared at the age of 90.

He was also a stalwart member of the Carlton Club and was appointed as an ambassador for UNICEF in 1998, running high-profile campaigns against landmines. In 2006, he wrote in an opinion piece for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Islam &quot;is the only faith on Earth that persuades its followers to seek political power and impose a law – sharia – which shapes everyone&#x27;s style of life&quot; and added that Islam &quot;forbids&quot; Muslims from conforming with British society. He continued to write into his 94th year, with his final article, published on 3 August 2007, about Darfur.

==Personal life==
Deedes was married to Evelyn Hilary Branfoot, who died in May 2004, by whom he had two sons Jeremy and Julius and three daughters, Juliet, Jill and Lucy. A convinced Christian like his father, he lived very unpretentiously on the edge of Romney Marsh, Kent, where his wife, Hilary, kept a menagerie of farm animals. He was never particularly well-off, preferring to use public transport whenever possible.

He was created a life peer on 23 September 1986, becoming Baron Deedes, of Aldington in the County of Kent, but he always preferred to be addressed as &quot;Bill&quot;, rather than &quot;Lord Deedes&quot;. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.

His son, Jeremy Deedes, was a director of the Telegraph Group of companies and was (2008–2012) a director of lobbyists Pelham Bell Pottinger. He has been a director of the Tote, chairman of The &quot;Sportsman&quot; newspaper, and was a director of Warwick Racecourse. He is the father of journalist Henry Deedes.

Lucy Deedes is a former Master of Foxhounds and was the first wife of Crispin James Alan Nevill Money-Coutts, 9th Baron Latymer. She is the mother of society magician Drummond Money-Coutts and the journalist Sophia Money-Coutts.

==Death==

Deedes died from bronchopneumonia at his home in Aldington on 17 August 2007, at the age of 94. There is a residential street named for him in the village, called Bill Deedes Way.

==Popular culture==

===&quot;Scoop&quot;===
According to many sources, Deedes was the journalist used by Evelyn Waugh as the model and inspiration for the hapless William Boot, protagonist of the satirical novel &quot;Scoop&quot;. Deedes himself said he &quot;spent part of my life brushing aside the charge&quot;, but admitted &quot;that my inexperience and naivety as a reporter in Africa might have contributed a few bricks to the building of Boot.&quot; The two had reported together in 1936, trying to cover the Second Italo-Abyssinian War; Deedes arrived in Addis Ababa aged 22 with almost 600 pounds of luggage. Berhanu Kebele, Ethiopian ambassador to London, pointed out that Deedes&#x27;s sharp journalistic instincts ensured Italian excesses were kept in the public eye.

Barring the question of age, a more appropriate model for Boot is William Beach Thomas who, according to Peter Stothard, &quot;was a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous &quot;Daily Mail&quot; war correspondent&quot; in World War I.

===&quot;Dear Bill&quot;===
Deedes was close to Margaret Thatcher and her husband Denis. The spoof letters &quot;from&quot; Mr. Thatcher which appeared in satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; throughout the Thatcher years were always addressed to &quot;Dear Bill&quot; – the &quot;Bill&quot; in question was usually assumed to be Deedes; however some instalments (e.g. 16 May and 28 November 1986) would suggest otherwise. The two men regularly played golf together, with Deedes saying it was a public service to take the spouse of the Prime Minister away from the stress of being married to the country&#x27;s head of government. The &quot;Eye&quot; also based its long-running editorial comment, &quot;Shome mishtake shurely?&quot;, on Deedes&#x27; distinctive slur.

<text>Anselm Leonard Strauss (December 18, 1916 – September 5, 1996) was an American sociologist professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) internationally known as a medical sociologist (especially for his pioneering attention to chronic illness and dying) and as the developer (with Barney Glaser) of grounded theory, an innovative method of qualitative analysis widely used in sociology, nursing, education, social work, and organizational studies. He also wrote extensively on Chicago sociology/symbolic interactionism, sociology of work, social worlds/arenas theory, social psychology and urban imagery. He published over 30 books, chapters in over 30 other books, and over 70 journal articles.

Strauss was born in New York City to Jewish immigrants in the United States and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York. His physician recommended that Strauss move to Arizona after high school because he suffered from bronchial problems. However, he moved to the University of Virginia in 1935, where he received his B.S. in Biology in 1939. From there he went to the University of Chicago, where he received his M.A. in sociology (1942) and his Ph.D. in the same field (1945). It was also there where he studied symbolic interactionism under Herbert Blumer, but ultimately completed his doctoral dissertation under the supervision of Ernest Burgess.

During the years 1944 to 1947, Strauss was on the faculty of Lawrence College. From there he moved to Indiana University (1946–1952), where he met and collaborated with Alfred Lindesmith; in 1949, they published their very influential book, &quot;Social Psychology&quot;. That volume was translated into Swedish, German, and Japanese and the eighth edition in English was published in 1999.

In 1952, Strauss returned to the University of Chicago as an assistant professor. During that time, he worked with Prof. Everett Hughes, and became associated with a group of colleagues who would become known as the &quot;Second Chicago School&quot; (e.g., Howard S. Becker and Erving Goffman). In 1960, he went to the School of Nursing at the University of California, San Francisco where he founded the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences. He chaired the department until 1987, although even as a professor emeritus he continued his research and teaching activities. During his time as chair, he was a consultant to the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1962 and 1970.

While at the University of California, San Francisco, Strauss and Barney Glaser originated grounded theory, which is widely used within qualitative research.

Strauss was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980. In that year he also received the Charles H. Cooley Award from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interactionism. Between 1955 and 1980, he was an invited visiting professor at the universities of Frankfurt and Konstanz in Germany, Cambridge and Manchester in England, Paris in France, and Adelaide in Australia.

Strauss married Frances Cooperstein in 1940 and was survived by her, his nephews Ted and Elliot Zucker and four grand-nephews and nieces, including Jonathan Zucker.

<doc id="462524" wikidata="Q775594" url="?curid=462524" title="Countdown">
<text>A countdown is a sequence of backward counting to indicate the time remaining before an event is scheduled to occur. NASA commonly employs the terms &quot;L-minus&quot; and &quot;T-minus&quot; during the preparation for and anticipation of a rocket launch, and even &quot;E-minus&quot; for events that involve spacecraft that are already in space, where the &quot;T&quot; could stand for &quot;Test&quot; or &quot;Time&quot;, and the &quot;E&quot; stands for &quot;Encounter&quot;, as with a comet or some other space object, like a spacecraft.

Other events for which countdowns are commonly used include the detonation of an explosive, the start of a race, the start of the New Year, or any anxiously anticipated event. An early use of a countdown once signaled the start of a Cambridge University rowing race. 

One of the first known associations with rockets was in the 1929 German science fiction movie &quot;Frau im Mond&quot; (English: &quot;Woman in the Moon&quot;) written by Thea von Harbou and directed by Fritz Lang in an attempt to increase the drama of the launch sequence of the story&#x27;s lunar-bound rocket.

== Rocketry ==
A countdown is a carefully devised set of procedures ending with launch of a rocket. Depending on the type of vehicle used, countdowns can start from 72 to 96 hours before launch time.

There are two countdowns proceeding simultaneously:
* The T-minus clock, a schedule of planned activities prior to launch (T−0), and
* The L-minus clock, a mechanical countdown to the time of launch (L−0).

Except for the last few minutes, which are highly automated and rigid, scheduled activities rarely take exactly the scheduled time, and the T-minus clock only corresponds approximately to the time until launch.

A &quot;hold&quot; is the suspension of the normal countdown process, during which the T-minus clock is stopped and no planned activities take place. This can be done to investigate a technical process that has gone wrong, or to intentionally delay the launch, e.g. because of bad weather at the launch pad. Most countdown schedules also include some pre-planned &quot;built-in holds&quot;. These provide an opportunity to perform non-launch activities, handle unexpected issues, or to catch up on the schedule if it is running long.

Under some circumstances, a countdown may be recycled to an earlier time. When that happens, launch personnel begin following the countdown checklist from the earlier point.

During countdown:
* Aerospace personnel bring the rocket vehicle to the launch site and load it with payload and propellants;
* Launch-center computers communicate with sensors in the rocket, which monitor important systems on the launch vehicle and payload;
* Launch personnel monitor the weather and wait for the launch window;
* Security personnel prevent unauthorized persons from entering the &quot;keep-out&quot; area.

The procedures for each launch are written carefully. For the Space Shuttle, a five-volume set, Shuttle Countdown (KSC S0007), often referred to as &quot;S0007&quot;, was used. Rosie Carver, a technical writer for United Launch Alliance, has created at least 15,000 procedures for more than 300 missions since the Solar Maximum Mission, which launched Feb. 14, 1980. These documents are living documents, which reflect new issues and solutions as they develop. Each mission requires approximately 100 procedure books.

Proceeding with the countdown depends on several factors, such as the proper launch window, weather that permits a safe launch, and the rocket and payload working properly.
The launch weather guidelines involving the Space Shuttle and expendable rockets are similar in many areas, but a distinction is made for the individual characteristics of each. The criteria are broadly conservative and assure avoidance of possibly adverse conditions. They are reviewed for each launch. For the Space Shuttle, weather &quot;outlooks&quot; provided by the U. S. Air Force Range Weather Operations Facility at Cape Canaveral began at Launch minus 5 days in coordination with the NOAA National Weather Service Spaceflight Meteorology Group at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. These included weather trends and their possible effects on launch day. A formal prelaunch weather briefing was held on Launch minus 1 day, which was a specific weather briefing for all areas of Space Shuttle launch operations.

The launch window is a precise time during which aerospace personnel launch a rocket so the payload can reach the proper orbital destination.

During communications for a countdown, the launch team uses acronyms to keep channels open as much as possible. All Firing Room console positions are assigned unique &#x27;call signs&#x27; that are used by the team for quick and positive identification of who is talking. For example, dialogue heard during the launch of a Delta II rocket carrying the Kepler Space Telescope on March 8, 2009, included:

In the context of a rocket launch, the &quot;L minus Time&quot; is the physical time before launch, e.g. &quot;L minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds&quot;. &quot;T minus Time&quot; is a system to mark points at which actions necessary for the launch are planned - this time stops and starts as various hold points are entered, and so doesn&#x27;t show the actual time to launch. The last ten seconds are usually counted down aloud &quot;Ten seconds to liftoff. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.&quot; After a launch, most countdown clocks begin to show Mission Elapsed Time, which is typically shown as &quot;T plus.&quot; The adjacent picture shows &quot;+00:00:07&quot;, approximately seven seconds after liftoff.

The time T−0 is specifically the moment of &quot;launch commit&quot;, when it is no longer possible to prevent liftoff. This is necessarily slightly before the moment the rocket actually lifts off the launch pad. Liquid-fueled rocket engines (which can be turned off after ignition) are normally lit a few seconds before T−0 and brought to full throttle around T−0. Solid rocket motors, which cannot be extinguished, are lit at T−0 and achieve full power a few seconds later. If a rocket has hold-down clamps which can withstand full engine thrust, the moment the clamps are released defines T−0.

In Fritz Lang&#x27;s film &quot;Frau im Mond&quot;, after each number the phrase &quot;seconds to go&quot; was repeated.

== Film ==

At the start of films, a countdown sequence is printed on the head leader, and is used to synchronize film reel changeovers (switching between reels of film). In film (but not television) the &#x27;Academy Leader&#x27; countdown first used in 1930 is in units of feet rather than time units; it starts at 11 and ends at 3 where it cuts to black for the last few feet. In 1959, SMPTE leader was created and measures seconds, not feet. It starts at 8 and cuts to black on the first frame of 2, which is accompanied by a &#x27;pop.&#x27; This leader eventually displaced the older Academy and was the only leader used by the end of the optical (film) projection era.

==New Year&#x27;s Eve==

In many New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations, there is a countdown during the last seconds of the old year until the beginning of the new year. These countdowns usually end in fireworks. Some celebrations also have countdowns to midnight in preceding timezones.

==Independence Day==
In Malaysia, the countdown is also used to celebrate independence day, with an event called Ambang Merdeka. The countdown was carried out at 11:59:50 pm and ended with chanting Merdeka 8 times and singing the national anthem.

<doc id="462531" wikidata="Q7892376" url="?curid=462531" title="United States congressional apportionment">
<text>United States congressional apportionment is the process by which seats in the United States House of Representatives are distributed among the 50 states according to the most recent decennial census mandated by the United States Constitution. After each state is assigned one seat in the House, most states are then apportioned a number of additional seats which roughly corresponds to its share of the aggregate population of the 50 states. Every state is constitutionally guaranteed two seats in the Senate and at least one seat in the House, regardless of population.

The U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; maximum number of seats has been limited to 435, capped at that number by the Reapportionment Act of 1929—except for a temporary (1959–1962) increase to 437 when Alaska and Hawaii were admitted into the Union. The Huntington–Hill method of equal proportions has been used to distribute the seats among the states since the 1940 census reapportionment. Federal law requires the clerk of the United States House of Representatives to notify each state government of the number of seats apportioned to the state no later than January 25 of the year immediately following each decennial census.

The size of a state&#x27;s total congressional delegation (which in addition to representative(s) includes 2 senators for each state) also determines the size of its representation in the U.S. Electoral College, which elects the U.S. president.

==Constitutional context==

Article One, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution initially provided:
The phrase &quot;all other persons&quot; refers to slaves, a word not used in the Constitution until the Thirteenth Amendment.

Following the end of the Civil War, the first of those provisions was superseded by Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment:

The phrase &quot;counting the whole number of persons in each State&quot; has traditionally been understood to include non-citizens for purposes of apportionment.

==Reapportionment==
Reapportionments normally occur following each decennial census, though the law that governs the total number of representatives and the method of apportionment to be carried into force at that time are enacted prior to the census.

The decennial apportionment also determines the size of each state&#x27;s representation in the U.S. Electoral College. Under Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the number of electors of any state equals the size of its total congressional delegation (House and Senate seats).

Federal law requires the Clerk of the House of Representatives to notify each state government no later than January 25 of the year immediately following the census of the number of seats to which it is entitled. Whether or not the number of seats has changed, the state determines the boundaries of congressional districts—geographical areas within the state of approximately equal population—in a process called redistricting.

Because the deadline for the House Clerk to report the results does not occur until the following January, and the states need sufficient time to perform the redistricting, the decennial census does not affect the elections that are held during that same year. For example, the electoral college apportionment and congressional races during the 2020 presidential election year were still based on the 2010 census results; all of the newly redrawn districts based on the 2020 census did not finally come into force until the 2022 midterm election winners were inaugurated in January 2023.

==Number of members==

The size of the U.S. House of Representatives refers to the total number of congressional districts (or seats) into which the land area of the United States proper has been divided. The number of voting representatives is currently set at 435. There are an additional five delegates to the House of Representatives. They represent the District of Columbia and the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, which first elected a representative in 2008, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Puerto Rico also elects a resident commissioner every four years.

===Controversy and history===
Since 1789, when the United States Congress first convened under the Constitution, the number of citizens per congressional district has risen from an average of 33,000 in 1790 to over 700,000 . Prior to the 20th century, the number of representatives increased every decade as more states joined the union, and the population increased.

The ideal number of members has been a contentious issue since the country&#x27;s founding. George Washington agreed that the original representation proposed during the Constitutional Convention (one representative for every 40,000) was inadequate and supported an alteration to reduce that number to 30,000. This was the only time that Washington pronounced an opinion on any of the actual issues debated during the entire convention. Five years later, Washington was so insistent on having no more than 30,000 constituents per representative that he exercised the first presidential veto in history on a bill which allowed half states to go over the quota.

In Federalist No. 55, James Madison argued that the size of the House of Representatives has to balance the ability of the body to legislate with the need for legislators to have a relationship close enough to the people to understand their local circumstances, that such representatives&#x27; social class be low enough to sympathize with the feelings of the mass of the people, and that their power be diluted enough to limit their abuse of the public trust and interests.

Madison also addressed Anti-Federalist claims that the representation would be inadequate, arguing that the major inadequacies are of minimal inconvenience since these will be cured rather quickly by virtue of decennial reapportionment. He noted, however,

Madison argued against the assumption that more is better:

==== Global comparison and disparities ====
When talking about the populations within California&#x27;s reapportioned House districts in 1951, a report from Duke University found that &quot;[there] is not an excessive disparity in district populations, but [the populations and disparities are] perhaps larger than necessary.&quot; If the House had a similar ratio of representatives to constituents as it did after the 1930 United States census, it would currently have 1,156 members (still just the second largest lower house, after China).

The United States has unusually large constituencies compared to other OECD countries, the third largest in the world. However, most of this is caused by the United States&#x27;s large population, which is the third-largest in the world; legislatures typically grow in proportion to the cube root of the population, rather than linearly, meaning larger countries tend to have larger constituency sizes.

=== Membership cap===
The Apportionment Act of 1911 (Public Law 62-5) raised the membership of the U.S. House to 433 and provided for an apportionment. It also provided for additional seats upon the admissions of Arizona and New Mexico as states, increasing the number to 435 in 1912.

In 1921, Congress failed to reapportion the House membership as required by the United States Constitution. This failure to reapportion may have been politically motivated, as the newly elected Republican majority may have feared the effect such a reapportionment would have on their future electoral prospects. A reapportionment in 1921 in the traditional fashion would have increased the size of the House to 483 seats, but many members would have lost their seats due to the population shifts, and the House chamber did not have adequate seats for 483 members. By 1929, no reapportionment had been made since 1911, and there was vast representational inequity, measured by the average district size. By 1929 some states had districts twice as large as others due to population growth and demographic shift.

In 1929 Congress (with Republican control of both houses of Congress and the presidency) passed the Reapportionment Act of 1929 which capped the size of the House at 435 and established a permanent method for apportioning a constant 435 seats. This cap has remained unchanged since then, except for a temporary increase to 437 members (twice, in 1959 and 1961) upon the 1959 admission of Alaska and Hawaii into the Union.

Two states, Wyoming and Vermont, have populations smaller than the average for a single district, although neither state has fewer people than the least populous congressional districts.

===Proposed expansion===
Among the Bill of Rights amendments to the United States Constitution proposed by Congress in 1789, was one addressing the number of seats in the House. It attempted to set a pattern for growth of the House along with the population, but has not been ratified.

Taken at face-value, with the nation&#x27;s population reaching approximately 308.7 million according to the 2010 census, the proposed amendment would have called for an up-to 6,000-member House. However, in the context of its original construction, the amendment may have instead outlined an iterative procedure for apportionment following a square root rule relative to the population (e.g. formula_1) that would still have called for a more than 1,600-member House following the same 2010 census. 

One proposal to alleviate the current constituency disparities and the high average number of constituents in many states&#x27; congressional districts is the &quot;Wyoming rule.&quot; Operating similar to New Zealand&#x27;s method of allocation for proportional representation, it would give the least populous state (which has been Wyoming since 1990) one representative and then create districts in other states with the same population.

Another proposed expansion rule, the cube root rule, calls for the membership of the legislature to be based on the cube root (rounded up) of the U.S. population at the last census. For example, such a rule would call for 692 members of the House based on the 2020 United States census. An additional House member would be added each time the &quot;national&quot; population &quot;exceeds&quot; the next cube; in this case, the next House member would be added when the census population reached 331,373,889, and the one after that at 332,812,558. A variation would split the representation between the House and the Senate, e.g. 592 members in the House (692 − 100 senators). 

On May 21, 2001, Rep. Alcee Hastings sent a dear colleague letter pointing out that U.S. expansion of its legislature had not kept pace with other countries.

In 2007, during the , Representative Tom Davis introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would add two seats to the House, one for Utah and one for the District of Columbia. It was passed by the House, but was tripped up by procedural hurdles in the Senate and withdrawn from consideration. An identical bill was reintroduced during the . In February 2009 the Senate adopted the measure 61–37. In April 2010, however, House leaders decided to shelve the proposal.

Two provisions of Section 102, subsection (d) in the Washington, D.C., Admission Act by delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton and its same-titled Senate companion by Sen. Tom Carper, both introduced in 2021 and again in 2023 during the and es, seek to amend Section 22(a) of the Reapportionment Act by adding one to the permanent House membership for a total of 436 representatives as the state of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth (i.e., Washington, D.C.) would have been entitled to an at-large district. Holmes Norton&#x27;s bill previously passed the House during the but not the Senate.

==Apportionment methods==

Apart from the requirement that each state is to be entitled to at least one representative in the House of Representatives, the number of representatives in each state is in principle to be proportional to its population. Since the adoption of the Constitution, five distinct apportionment methods have been used.
The first apportionment was contained in Art. I, § 2, cl. 3 of the Constitution. After the first census in 1790, Congress passed the Apportionment Act of 1792 and adopted the Jefferson method to apportion U.S. representatives to the states based on population. The Jefferson method required fractional remainders to be discarded when calculating each state&#x27;s total number of U.S. representatives and was used until the 1830 census. The Webster method, proposed in 1832 by Daniel Webster and adopted for the 1840 census, allocated an additional representative to states with a fractional remainder greater than 0.5. 

From 1850 to 1900, the situation was substantially less clear. Congress passed a law in 1850 declaring future apportionment would be done with Hamilton&#x27;s method. However, Congress continued to pass ad hoc apportionment bills from 1850 through 1900, in each case overruling the procedure laid out in the 1850 census. This was particularly true after the 1860 Census: the national situation was complicated by the Civil War), and no real apportionment method was used. Apart from 1860, Congress deliberately chose after each census to set the size of the House at a level where Hamilton and Webster&#x27;s methods gave the same apportionment. This unofficial adoption of Webster&#x27;s method was driven by the discovery of the Alabama paradox, which created an uproar in the House. The Apportionment Act of 1911, in addition to setting the number of U.S. representatives at 435, returned to the Webster method, which was used following the 1910 and 1930 censuses (no reapportionment was done after the 1920 census). The current method, known as the Huntington–Hill method or method of equal proportions, was adopted in 1941 for reapportionment based on the 1940 census and beyond. The revised method was necessary in the context of the cap on the number of representatives set in the Reapportionment Act of 1929.

===Method of equal proportions===
The apportionment method currently used is the method of equal proportions, which minimizes the percentage differences in the number of people per representative among the different states. The resulting apportionment is optimal in the sense that any additional transfer of a seat from one state to another would result in larger percentage differences.

In this method, as a first step, each of the 50 states is given its one guaranteed seat in the House of Representatives, leaving 385 seats to assign. The remaining seats are allocated one at a time, to the state with the highest priority number. Thus, the 51st seat would go to the most populous state (currently California). The priority number is determined by the ratio of the state population to the geometric mean of the number of seats it currently holds in the assignment process, &quot;n&quot; (initially 1), and the number of seats it &quot;would&quot; hold &quot;if&quot; the seat were assigned to it, &quot;n&quot;+1. Symbolically, the priority number &quot;An&quot; is

:formula_2

where &quot;P&quot; is the population of the state, and &quot;n&quot; is the number of seats it currently holds before the possible allocation of the next seat. An equivalent, recursive definition is

:formula_3
:formula_4

where &quot;n&quot; is still the number of seats the state has before allocation of the next (in other words, for the &quot;m&quot;th allocation, &quot;n&quot; = &quot;m&quot;-1).

Consider the reapportionment following the 2010 U.S. census: beginning with all states initially being allocated one seat, the largest value of &quot;A&quot;1 corresponds to the largest state, California, which is allocated seat 51. After being allocated its 2nd seat, its priority value decreases to its &quot;A&quot;2 value, which is reordered to a position back in line. The 52nd seat goes to Texas, the 2nd largest state, because its &quot;A&quot;1 priority value is larger than the &quot;An&quot; of any other state. However, the 53rd seat goes back to California because its &quot;A&quot;2 priority value is larger than the &quot;An&quot; of any other state. The 54th seat goes to New York because its &quot;A&quot;1 priority value is larger than the &quot;An&quot; of any other state at this point. This process continues until all remaining seats are assigned. Each time a state is assigned a seat, &quot;n&quot; is incremented by 1, causing its priority value to be reduced and reordered among the states, whereupon another state normally rises to the top of the list.

The 2010 census ranking of priority values shows the order in which seats 51–435 were apportioned after the 2010 census, with additional listings for the next five priorities. Minnesota was allocated the final (435th) seat. North Carolina missed its 14th seat by 15,754 residents as the 436th seat to be allocated; ten years earlier it had gained its 13th seat as the 435th seat to be allocated based on the 2000 census.

The 2020 census ranking of priority values shows the order in which seats 51–435 were apportioned after the 2020 census, with additional listings for the next ten priorities. For the second time in a row, Minnesota was allocated the final (435th) seat. If either New York had registered 89 more residents or Minnesota had registered 26 fewer residents, New York would have been allocated the 435th seat instead.

<text>The Lotka–Volterra equations, also known as the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model, are a pair of first-order nonlinear differential equations, frequently used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, one as a predator and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations:
formula_1

where
*the variable is the population density of prey (for example, the number of rabbits per square kilometre);
*the variable is the population density of some predator (for example, the number of foxes per square kilometre);
*formula_2 and formula_3 represent the instantaneous growth rates of the two populations;
* represents time;
*The prey&#x27;s parameters, and , describe, respectively, the maximum prey per capita growth rate, and the effect of the presence of predators on the prey death rate. 
*The predator&#x27;s parameters, , , respectively describe the predator&#x27;s per capita death rate, and the effect of the presence of prey on the predator&#x27;s growth rate. 
*All parameters are positive and real.

The solution of the differential equations is deterministic and continuous. This, in turn, implies that the generations of both the predator and prey are continually overlapping.

The Lotka–Volterra system of equations is an example of a Kolmogorov population model (not to be confused with the better known Kolmogorov equations), which is a more general framework that can model the dynamics of ecological systems with predator–prey interactions, competition, disease, and mutualism.

== Biological interpretation and model assumptions ==

The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this exponential growth is represented in the equation above by the term . The rate of predation on the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet; this is represented above by . If either or is zero, then there can be no predation. With these two terms the prey equation above can be interpreted as follows: the rate of change of the prey&#x27;s population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is preyed upon.

The term represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). The term represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration; it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey. Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator&#x27;s population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate.

The Lotka–Volterra predator-prey model makes a number of assumptions about the environment and biology of the predator and prey populations:
# The prey population finds ample food at all times.
# The food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population.
# The rate of change of population is proportional to its size.
# During the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species, and genetic adaptation is inconsequential.
# Predators have limitless appetite.
# Both populations can be described by a single variable. This amounts to assuming that the populations do not have a spatial or age distribution that contributes to the dynamics.

== Biological relevance of the model ==
None of the assumptions above are likely to hold for natural populations. Nevertheless, the Lotka–Volterra model shows two important properties of predator and prey populations and these properties often extend to variants of the model in which these assumptions are relaxed:

Firstly, the dynamics of predator and prey populations have a tendency to oscillate. Fluctuating numbers of predators and prey have been observed in natural populations, such as the lynx and snowshoe hare data of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the moose and wolf populations in Isle Royale National Park.

Secondly, the population equilibrium of this model has the property that the prey equilibrium density (given by formula_4) depends on the predator&#x27;s parameters, and the predator equilibrium density (given by formula_5) on the prey&#x27;s parameters. This has as a consequence that an increase in, for instance, the prey growth rate, formula_6, leads to an increase in the predator equilibrium density, but not the prey equilibrium density. Making the environment better for the prey benefits the predator, not the prey (this is related to the paradox of the pesticides and to the paradox of enrichment). A demonstration of this phenomenon is provided by the increased percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of World War I (1914–18), when prey growth rate was increased due to a reduced fishing effort.

A further example is provided by the experimental iron fertilization of the ocean. In several experiments large amounts of iron salts were dissolved in the ocean. The expectation was that iron, which is a limiting nutrient for phytoplankton, would boost growth of phytoplankton and that it would sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The addition of iron typically leads to a short bloom in phytoplankton, which is quickly consumed by other organisms (such as small fish or zooplankton) and limits the effect of enrichment mainly to increased predator density, which in turn limits the carbon sequestration. This is as predicted by the equilibrium population densities of the Lotka–Volterra predator-prey model, and is a feature that carries over to more elaborate models in which the restrictive assumptions of the simple model are relaxed.

== Applications to economics and marketing ==
The Lotka–Volterra model has additional applications to areas such as economics and marketing. It can be used to describe the dynamics in a market with several competitors, complementary platforms and products, a sharing economy, and more. There are situations in which one of the competitors drives the other competitors out of the market and other situations in which the market reaches an equilibrium where each firm stabilizes on its market share. It is also possible to describe situations in which there are cyclical changes in the industry or chaotic situations with no equilibrium and changes are frequent and unpredictable.

==History==

The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model was initially proposed by Alfred J. Lotka in the theory of autocatalytic chemical reactions in 1910. This was effectively the logistic equation, originally derived by Pierre François Verhulst. In 1920 Lotka extended the model, via Andrey Kolmogorov, to &quot;organic systems&quot; using a plant species and a herbivorous animal species as an example and in 1925 he used the equations to analyse predator–prey interactions in his book on biomathematics. The same set of equations was published in 1926 by Vito Volterra, a mathematician and physicist, who had become interested in mathematical biology. Volterra&#x27;s enquiry was inspired through his interactions with the marine biologist Umberto D&#x27;Ancona, who was courting his daughter at the time and later was to become his son-in-law. D&#x27;Ancona studied the fish catches in the Adriatic Sea and had noticed that the percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of World War I (1914–18). This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years and, as prey fish the preferred catch, one would intuitively expect this to increase of prey fish percentage. Volterra developed his model to explain D&#x27;Ancona&#x27;s observation and did this independently from Alfred Lotka. He did credit Lotka&#x27;s earlier work in his publication, after which the model has become known as the &quot;Lotka-Volterra model&quot;.

The model was later extended to include density-dependent prey growth and a functional response of the form developed by C. S. Holling; a model that has become known as the Rosenzweig–MacArthur model. Both the Lotka–Volterra and Rosenzweig–MacArthur models have been used to explain the dynamics of natural populations of predators and prey.

In the late 1980s, an alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model (and its common-prey-dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or Arditi–Ginzburg model. The validity of prey- or ratio-dependent models has been much debated.

The Lotka–Volterra equations have a long history of use in economic theory; their initial application is commonly credited to Richard Goodwin in 1965 or 1967.

==Solutions to the equations==
The equations have periodic solutions. These solutions do not have a simple expression in terms of the usual trigonometric functions, although they are quite tractable.

If none of the non-negative parameters , , , vanishes, three can be absorbed into the normalization of variables to leave only one parameter: since the first equation is homogeneous in , and the second one in , the parameters &quot;β&quot;/&quot;α&quot; and &quot;δ&quot;/&quot;γ&quot; are absorbable in the normalizations of and respectively, and into the normalization of , so that only remains arbitrary. It is the only parameter affecting the nature of the solutions.

A linearization of the equations yields a solution similar to simple harmonic motion with the population of predators trailing that of prey by 90° in the cycle.

===A simple example===
Suppose there are two species of animals, a rabbit (prey) and a fox (predator). If the initial densities are 10 rabbits and 10 foxes per square kilometre, one can plot the progression of the two species over time; given the parameters that the growth and death rates of rabbits are 1.1 and 0.4 while that of foxes are 0.1 and 0.4 respectively. The choice of time interval is arbitrary.

One may also plot solutions parametrically as orbits in phase space, without representing time, but with one axis representing the number of prey and the other axis representing the densities of predators for all times.

This corresponds to eliminating time from the two differential equations above to produce a single differential equation
:formula_7
relating the variables &quot;x&quot; (predator) and &quot;y&quot; (prey). The solutions of this equation are closed curves. It is amenable to separation of variables: integrating
:formula_8 
yields the implicit relationship 
: formula_9
where &quot;V&quot; is a constant quantity depending on the initial conditions and conserved on each curve.

An aside: These graphs illustrate a serious potential limitation in the application as a biological model: for this specific choice of parameters, in each cycle, the rabbit population is reduced to extremely low numbers, yet recovers (while the fox population remains sizeable at the lowest rabbit density). In real-life situations, however, chance fluctuations of the discrete numbers of individuals might cause the rabbits to actually go extinct, and, by consequence, the foxes as well. This modelling problem has been called the &quot;atto-fox problem&quot;, an atto-fox being a notional 10−18 of a fox. A density of 10−18 foxes per square kilometre equates to an average of approximately 5×10−10 foxes on the surface of the earth, which in practical terms means that foxes are extinct.

===Hamiltonian structure of the system===
Since the quantity formula_10 is conserved over time, it plays role of a Hamiltonian function of the system. To see this we can define Poisson bracket as follows 
formula_11. Then Hamilton&#x27;s equations read
formula_12
The variables formula_13 and formula_14 are not canonical, since formula_15. However, using transformations formula_16 and formula_17 we came up to a canonical form of the Hamilton&#x27;s equations featuring the Hamiltonian formula_18:
formula_19
The Poisson bracket for the canonical variables formula_20 now takes the standard form formula_21.

===Phase-space plot of a further example===
A less extreme example covers: 
, , . Assume , quantify thousands each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from = = 0.9 to 1.8, in steps of 0.1. The fixed point is at (1, 1/2).

==Dynamics of the system==
In the model system, the predators thrive when prey is plentiful but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator population is low, the prey population will increase again. These dynamics continue in a population cycle of growth and decline.

===Population equilibrium===
Population equilibrium occurs in the model when neither of the population levels is changing, i.e. when both of the derivatives are equal to 0:
formula_22
formula_23

The above system of equations yields two solutions:
formula_24
and
formula_25

Hence, there are two equilibria.

The first solution effectively represents the extinction of both species. If both populations are at 0, then they will continue to be so indefinitely. The second solution represents a fixed point at which both populations sustain their current, non-zero numbers, and, in the simplified model, do so indefinitely. The levels of population at which this equilibrium is achieved depend on the chosen values of the parameters &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;γ&quot;, and &quot;δ&quot;.

===Stability of the fixed points===
The stability of the fixed point at the origin can be determined by performing a linearization using partial derivatives.

The Jacobian matrix of the predator–prey model is
formula_26
and is known as the community matrix.

====First fixed point (extinction)====
When evaluated at the steady state of , the Jacobian matrix becomes
formula_27

The eigenvalues of this matrix are
formula_28

In the model and are always greater than zero, and as such the sign of the eigenvalues above will always differ. Hence the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point.

The instability of this fixed point is of significance. If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels. However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model.) The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover.

====Second fixed point (oscillations)====
Evaluating &quot;J&quot; at the second fixed point leads to
formula_29

The eigenvalues of this matrix are
formula_30

As the eigenvalues are both purely imaginary and conjugate to each other, this fixed point must either be a center for closed orbits in the local vicinity or an attractive or repulsive spiral. In conservative systems, there must be closed orbits in the local vicinity of fixed points that exist at the minima and maxima of the conserved quantity. The conserved quantity is derived above to be formula_31 on orbits. Thus orbits about the fixed point are closed and elliptic, so the solutions are periodic, oscillating on a small ellipse around the fixed point, with a frequency formula_32 and period formula_33.

As illustrated in the circulating oscillations in the figure above, the level curves are closed orbits surrounding the fixed point: the levels of the predator and prey populations cycle and oscillate without damping around the fixed point with frequency formula_34.

The value of the constant of motion , or, equivalently, , formula_35, can be found for the closed orbits near the fixed point.

Increasing moves a closed orbit closer to the fixed point. The largest value of the constant is obtained by solving the optimization problem
formula_36
The maximal value of &quot;K&quot; is thus attained at the stationary (fixed) point formula_37 and amounts to 
formula_38
where is Euler&#x27;s number.

<doc id="462535" wikidata="Q166755" url="?curid=462535" title="Blue Ridge Mountains">
<text>The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Highlands range. The mountain range is located in the Eastern United States and extends 550 miles southwest from southern Pennsylvania through Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. The province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range.

The Blue Ridge Mountains are known for having a bluish color when seen from a distance. Trees put the &quot;blue&quot; in Blue Ridge, from the isoprene released into the atmosphere. This contributes to the characteristic haze on the mountains and their perceived color.

Within the Blue Ridge province are two major national parks: Shenandoah National Park in the northern section and Great Smoky Mountains National Park in the southern section. The Blue Ridge Parkway, a long scenic highway, connects the two parks and runs along the ridge crest-lines, as does the Appalachian Trail. Eight national forests include George Washington and Jefferson, Cherokee, Pisgah, Nantahala and Chattahoochee.

==Geography==
Although the term &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; is sometimes applied exclusively to the eastern edge or front range of the Appalachian Mountains, the geological definition of the Blue Ridge province extends westward to the Ridge and Valley area, encompassing the Great Smoky Mountains, the Great Balsams, the Roans, the Blacks, and other mountain ranges. In North Carolina, two lower elevation ranges to the east, referred to as foothills, are also often included as &quot;spurs&quot; of the Blue Ridge: the Brushy Mountains and the South Mountains. In Virginia, the Southwest Mountains are an anticlinal range that similarly parallels the Blue Ridge.

The Blue Ridge extends as far south as Mount Oglethorpe in Georgia and as far north into Pennsylvania as South Mountain. While South Mountain dwindles to hills between Gettysburg and Harrisburg, the band of ancient rocks that form the core of the Blue Ridge continues northeast through the New Jersey and Hudson River highlands, eventually reaching the Berkshires of Massachusetts and the Green Mountains of Vermont.

The Blue Ridge contains the highest mountains in eastern North America south of Baffin Island. About 125 peaks exceed in elevation. The highest peak in the Blue Ridge (and in the entire Appalachian chain) is Mount Mitchell in North Carolina at . There are 39 peaks in North Carolina and Tennessee higher than ; by comparison, in the northern portion of the Appalachian chain only New Hampshire&#x27;s Mount Washington rises above . Southern Sixers is a term used by peak baggers for this group of mountains.

The Blue Ridge Parkway runs along crests of the southern Appalachians and links two national parks: Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains. In many places along the parkway, there are metamorphic rocks (gneiss) with folded bands of light-and dark-colored minerals, which sometimes look like the folds and swirls in a marble cake.

==Geology==
Most of the rocks that form the Blue Ridge Mountains are ancient granitic charnockites, metamorphosed volcanic formations, and sedimentary limestone. Recent studies completed by Richard Tollo, a professor and geologist at George Washington University, provide greater insight into the petrologic and geochronologic history of the Blue Ridge basement suites. Modern studies have found that the basement geology of the Blue Ridge is made of compositionally unique gneisses and granitoids, including orthopyroxene-bearing charnockites. Analysis of zircon minerals in the granite completed by John Aleinikoff at the U.S. Geological Survey has provided more detailed emplacement ages.

Many of the features found in the Blue Ridge and documented by Tollo and others have confirmed that the rocks exhibit many similar features in other North American Grenville-age terranes. The lack of a calc-alkaline affinity and zircon ages less than 1.2 billion years old suggest that the Blue Ridge is distinct from the Adirondacks, Green Mountains, and possibly the New York–New Jersey Highlands. The petrologic and geochronologic data suggest that the Blue Ridge basement is a composite orogenic crust that was emplaced during several episodes from a crustal magma source. Field relationships further illustrate that rocks emplaced prior to 1.078–1.064 billion years ago preserve deformational features. Those emplaced post-1.064 billion years ago generally have a massive texture and missed the main episode of Mesoproterozoic compression.

At the time of their emergence, the Blue Ridge were among the highest mountains in the world and reached heights comparable to the much younger Alps. Weathering, erosion, and mass wasting over hundreds of millions of years has resulted in much shorter peaks.

==History==

At the foot of the Blue Ridge, various tribes including the Siouan Manahoacs, the Iroquois, and the Shawnee hunted and fished. A German physician-explorer, John Lederer, first reached the crest of the Blue Ridge in 1669 and again the following year; he also recorded the Virginia Siouan name for the Blue Ridge (&quot;Ahkonshuck&quot;).

At the Treaty of Albany negotiated by Virginia Lieutenant Governor Alexander Spotswood with the Iroquois between 1718 and 1722, the Iroquois ceded lands they had conquered south of the Potomac River and east of the Blue Ridge to the Virginia Colony. This treaty made the Blue Ridge the new demarcation point between the areas and tribes subject to the Six Nations, and those tributaries to the colony. When colonists began to disregard this by crossing the Blue Ridge and settling in the Shenandoah Valley in the 1730s, the Iroquois began to object, finally selling their rights to the valley, on the west side of the Blue Ridge, at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744.

==Flora and fauna==
===Flora===

The Blue Ridge Mountains have stunted oak and oak-hickory forest habitats, which comprise most of the Appalachian slope forests. Flora also includes grass, shrubs, hemlock and mixed-oak pine forests.

While the Blue Ridge range includes the highest summits in the eastern United States, the climate is nevertheless too warm to support an alpine zone, and thus the range lacks the tree line found at lower elevations in the northern half of the Appalachian range. Statistical modelling predicts that the alpine tree line would exist at above 7,985 feet (2434 m) in the climate zone and latitude of the southern Appalachians. The highest parts of the Blue Ridge are generally vegetated in dense Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forests.

===Fauna===
The area is host to many animals, including:
*Many species of amphibians and reptiles
*Ocoee salamander
*A large diversity of fish species, many of which are endemic
*American black bear
*Songbirds and other bird species
*Bobcat
*Coyote
*Red fox 
*Gray fox
*Grouse
*North American River Otter
*Whitetail deer
*Wild boar
*Wild turkey

==Population centers==
The largest city located in the Blue Ridge Mountains is Roanoke, located in Southwest Virginia, while the largest Metropolitan Statistical Area is the Greenville metropolitan area in Upstate, South Carolina. Other notable cities in the Blue Ridge Mountains include Charlottesville, Frederick, Hagerstown, Chambersburg, Asheville, Johnson City, and Lynchburg.

<text>Lubao, officially the Municipality of Lubao (; ), is a municipality in the province of Pampanga, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 173,502 people.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the indigenous term &quot;lubo&quot; which means low or sunken, reflective of the area&#x27;s muddy and flooded characteristics. Lubao is also known by its Kapampangan language equivalent Baba.

According to Spanish records by Fr. Diego Martínez, Lubao was also once called Lubag.

== History ==

=== Precolonial era ===
Before the arrival of the Spaniards, Lubao was said to have already been one of the prosperous major settlements in Pampanga and is considered as the oldest settlement in Pampanga and the cradle of Kapampangan civilization.

By 1571, Lubao was a heavily fortified settlement claimed to be under the rule of Datu Macabulus, the last chieftain of Lubao who was part of the Soliman clan of Lubao. It is also claimed that the Soliman clan was the origin of the rulers of Maynila, such as Lakandula, Rajah Matanda and Rajah Sulayman, although this is not widely mentioned in scholarly works, except by historian John Larkin, who suggested that Rajah Sulayman was possibly from Lubao. Revolutionary leader of Tarlac, Francisco Macabulos, whose father himself was from Lubao, was a descendant of Datu Macabulus.

According to Governor-General Francisco de Sande, Lubao was the site of a major river in Pampanga, which helped the settlement produce large amounts of rice. By 1572, Lubao housed 3,500 people, who were described to be Moros, suggesting that Islam had already reached Lubao by the time of Spanish conquest.

=== Spanish colonial era ===
After the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Bangkusay on June 3, 1571 between the Spanish and Visayan mercenary forces of Legazpi and the combined Kapampangan-Tagalog fleet under Rajah Sulayman and Tarik Sulayman of Macabebe, Betis and Lubao remained defiant to Spanish rule, forcing the Spaniards to launch an invasion against them. After the Spanish conquest of Pampanga, Martín de Goiti, together with Lt. Antonio Carvajal and the Augustinian missionaries established Lubao as a Spanish settlement on September 14, 1571 after Datu Macabulus and the Council of Elders received the Spaniards with conciliatory promises of capitulation.

Fr. Diego de Herrera first established a convent in the settlement where the locals constructed a brick church called the San Agustin Church in the nearby village of Gato in 1572, marking the beginning of Christianization of Lubao. Gato became a visita of Tondo in May 3 of the same year. In 1579, Fr. Francisco Manrique began his missionary efforts in the town.

In 1583, Kapampangans were forced to work in the goldmines of Ilocos and not allowed to return in time for the planting season, causing a severe food shortage and eventual famine in Lubao, leading to the deaths of 1,000 people in the town by 1584. Due to this aforementioned disaster and the abuses by encomenderos, a mass uprising occurred in Lubao in 1585 and other Kapampangan settlements, but were suppressed afterwards.

In 1589, Philip III of Spain ordered Governor-General Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas in the construction of a fort in Lubao after the recent raids by Sambals from the nearby Zambales region.

In 1591, Lubao was described to be an encomienda along with Betis under the Spanish crown, which housed 5,000 tributes which amounted to 20,000 inhabitants, with four Augustinian convents and an alcalde mayor with a deputy.

After the Francisco Maniago Revolt in October 1660, the people of Lubao was successfully persuaded by Juan Macapagal of Arayat to end their participation in the revolt. As a result of the revolt, Governor-General Sabiniano Manrique de Lara ordered the construction of a fort in Lubao called the Fortaleza de Mamalas, to serve as a garrison fort for any future revolts in the town.

=== Revolutionary era ===

On November 17, 1896, the people of Bataan invited the locals of Lubao to join in the attack against the Spanish church in Hermosa. The people of Lubao accepted the invitation, and together with the combined forces of the people from the towns of Lubao, Orani, Hermosa and Hagonoy in Bulacan, they attacked the Hermosa Church and proceeded to behead and mutilate the fingers and genitals of Fr. David Varas. Other parts of his body were turned into amulets (anting-anting). After the incident, Spanish forces along with a Kapampangan contingent launched an offensive against the revolutionaries at Orani, leading to the deaths of 200 revolutionaries. Two Spanish contingents were then assigned in the nearby towns of Dinalupihan and Hermosa.

On June 3, 1898, Spanish religious authorities fled from Bataan and Lubao towards Macabebe, which was followed by a takeover by revolutionaries, who were later absorbed into the Philippine Revolutionary Army. On June 12, the Philippines under President Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence from Spain.

=== Philippine-American War ===
In 1899, the Church of Lubao was used as a hospital by American soldiers fighting the Philippine Republican Army. On September 22, 1900, the Military Government of the Philippine Islands under the United States placed Lubao under a civil administration. Between 1911–1912, a group of outlaws began raiding various barrios of Lubao near the Bataan border.

=== World War II ===
On December 8, 1941, the Japanese Invasion of the Philippines began. On January 3, 1942, the Japanese 2nd Formosa Infantry pushed the USAFIP 11th Infantry south from Guagua, then on to Lubao in the evening of the 4th, and then to the Gumain River by the 5th.

During the month of January, Silvestre Liwanag reported the presence of armed groups of the Aguman ding Maldang Talapagobra stationed in the nearby mountains carrying homemade guns and stolen rifles from hacienderos in defiance to Japanese rule in Lubao, in which Liwanag would later join the group. These groups were later incorporated into the Hukbalahap, the leading communist resistance guerrilla organization at the time.

===Baybay Ilog===

Baybay Ilog (Sagip Ilog) is a project of Department of Tourism and Congresswoman Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.

In the Baybay Ilog, Bye-bye Basura project, officials and volunteers gathered at the Banqueruan Port in San Nicolas 1st, Lubao where the clean-up drive started. After a brief program, the whole contingent coursed the river, checked the preparation of the communities and conducted the river clean-up. The Lubao-Sasmuan River was one of the ecosystems heavily affected when Mount Pinatubo erupted 20 years ago. With this project coinciding with the anniversary of the said volcanic eruption and our country&#x27;s independence day celebration, the people from Lubao and Sasmuan are looking at it as a liberation from the dreaded effects of the said natural disaster which, through tourism, will pave the way for the rise to progress of the said communities. Once again, the river is resuming its role, as a driving factor for the growth of a civilization.

The symbolic river clean-up dubbed as “Baybay-Ilog, Bye-bye Basura”, is the first step in preparing the people in 17 identified Barangays that will benefit from the Pampanga bayou river cruise project spearheaded by the local government units of Sasmuan and Lubao in cooperation with the Provincial government of Pampanga and the second district congressional office of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. River Clean-up held last June 12, 2011. This event mobilized more than 700 volunteers from Sasmuan and Lubao for ground and boat contingents. With the support of the Local Government Units of Sasmuan and Lubao, Community Volunteers and Social Preparation Group of Pampanga Bayou Development Project, this was really an astounding success.

There were 700 volunteers from 13 coastal barangays boarded participating boats at the Banqueruan banca port at the town of San Nicolas, Lubao to participate in the symbolic river cleanup shortly after the sun rose on an otherwise lazy Sunday morning. Armed with cleaning tools, the residents carefully rid the river of wastes in preparation for the formal launch of the town&#x27;s newest tourist attraction – the Pampanga river bayou cruise. Prior to the river cleanup, Christian Narito, project leader of the social preparation phase of the Pampanga Wetlands Development Project, said the identified 17 barangay communities located along the cruise route had earlier been educated about the benefits tourism could bring into the communities. “People within and around the area participated in determining how will they react or be affected by any major development planned within their area of residence. We helped them identify their strengths and how they could contribute to the river cruise project,” Narito said.

<doc id="462537" wikidata="Q1237409" url="?curid=462537" title="John Moore (bishop of Ely)">
<text>John Moore (1646–1714) was Bishop of Norwich (1691–1707) and Bishop of Ely (1707–1714) and was a famous bibliophile whose vast collection of books forms the surviving &quot;Royal Library&quot; within Cambridge University Library.

==Origins==
Bishop John Moore was descended from the ancient family of De La Moor (later Moore), of Moore Hayes in the parish of Cullompton in Devonshire, England. He was born in Market Harborough in Leicestershire, the son of Thomas Moore (1621–1686), an ironmonger of Market Harborough, by his wife Elizabeth Wright, daughter of Edward Wright of Sutton in the parish of Broughton, Leicestershire. The Bishop&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Rev. John Moore (c.1595–1657) a clergyman of Puritan views and an author of pamphlets against enclosures, who was a younger son of Sir John Moore of Moor Hayes, knighted at the Palace of Westminster by King Edward VI in 1549, by his wife Katherine Pomeroy, a daughter of Sir Thomas Pomeroy (1503-1566),
feudal baron of Berry Pomeroy in Devon, who in 1547 sold Berry Pomeroy Castle, Deer park and manor to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of England from 1547 until 1549 during the minority of his nephew, King Edward VI (1547-1553), and eldest brother of Queen Jane Seymour (d.1537), the third wife of King Henry VIII.

==Career==
He was educated at Clare Hall, Cambridge where he subsequently became a Fellow in 1667. He was Rector of Blaby in Leicestershire from 1676 to 1687, and subsequently became Rector of St Ann&#x27;s, Westminster and St Andrew, Holborn. By 1670 he was a member of the household of Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham, whom he served as chaplain. He supported the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and was appointed a Royal Chaplain to the new King William III.

Moore was appointed Bishop of Norwich in 1691. He was a Whig in politics, and supported the Low Church party. He gave practical support to leading theologians, such as Richard Bentley, Gilbert Burnet and John Strype, and he found preferment for Samuel Clarke, William Whiston (whose undergraduate study he subsidised) and Samuel Knight.

Moore was translated to the See of Ely in 1707. When it was proposed that Bentley should be appointed Bishop of Chichester (1709), the support of Moore was enlisted on his behalf. As Visitor of Trinity College, Cambridge, he presided at the trial of Bentley and during the sessions at his London townhouse of Ely Palace he caught a cold. He died in Ely on 31 July 1714 and was buried in Ely Cathedral.

==Bibliophile==
At the time of his death in 1714, Moore&#x27;s collection of books and papers contained over 30,000 items, and may have been the largest in England. To celebrate his coronation, King George I caused it to be purchased intact, at a cost of 6,000 guineas, and donated it to Cambridge University Library. Moore&#x27;s library alone contained nearly double the previous material in that library. While some material has been removed over the years, the gift is still largely intact, and is called &quot;The Royal Library&quot; in honour of its patron. Notable books in his library include the &quot;Book of Deer&quot; and the &quot;Treatise of Love&quot;.

==Marriages==
Moore married twice: 
*Firstly to Rose Butler, daughter of Neville Thomas Alexander Butler by his wife Cicely Aglionby; 
*Secondly (as her third husband) to Dorothy Barnes, daughter of William Barnes of Sadberge, County Durham, and widow of Sir Richard Browne, 3rd Baronet (c. 1656–1689) (Browne baronets, of London, cr.1660), who was killed in Flanders in 1689 by Colonel Billingsley.

<text>Sixth Army is a theater army of the United States Army. The Army service component command of United States Southern Command, its area of responsibility includes 31 countries and 15 areas of special sovereignty in Central and South America and the Caribbean. It is headquartered at Fort Sam Houston.

The Sixth Army saw extensive service in the South Pacific during World War II, including in New Britain, New Guinea, and the Philippines. Postwar it served stateside training army forces until its inactivation during force reduction in 1995. The army was reactivated in 2007.

==History==

===Interwar period===

====Sixth Army (I)====

The first iteration of the Sixth Army was authorized by the National Defense Act of 1920 and was originally to be composed of Organized Reserve units primarily from the Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Corps Areas. The Sixth Army Headquarters and Headquarters Company were constituted in the Organized Reserve on 15 October 1921 and allotted to the Seventh Corps Area. Little Rock, Arkansas, was designated as the army headquarters upon organization, but the unit was never organized at that location. The Headquarters Company was initiated 13 October 1922 at Little Rock. Little Rock remained the Sixth Army’s headquarters location upon the event of its activation until 25 February 1924, when St. Louis, Missouri, was designated as the army’s new headquarters location. The headquarters was initiated in August 1924 at St. Louis. The Headquarters Company was inactivated at Little Rock on 1 October 1924 and relocated to St. Louis. Due to the abandonment of the “Six Army” plan in favor of the “Four Army” plan, the Sixth Army was deleted from the mobilization plans on 1 October 1933 and demobilized (disbanded). Its subordinate units were reassigned to the Fourth Army, the General Headquarters Reserve, or demobilized.

===World War II===

====Sixth Army (II)====

The Sixth United States Army was activated in January 1943, commanded by Lieutenant General Walter Krueger. Under the code name Alamo Force, it assumed control of the majority of US Army units involved in Operation Cartwheel, the campaign to isolate and neutralize the Japanese base at Rabaul in New Britain. Following the completion of Cartwheel, Sixth Army joined the Australian Army and other US forces on the north coast of New Guinea. Similar in conception to the island hopping operations of the central Pacific, the object of the attacks was to land, establish a garrison and airfield which could support the next strike, and then move on.

In September 1944, Sixth Army was relieved from operations in New Guinea by the Eighth Army. On 20 October 1944, X Corps and XXIV Corps, under Sixth Army, invaded Leyte in the Philippines. By December, Leyte was secured, and the Sixth Army was relieved again by Eighth Army to prepare for the invasion of Luzon. As a prelude to that invasion, the island of Mindoro was invaded by the Western Visayan Task Force comprising the 19th and 503rd Regimental Combat Teams. Sixth Army took part in the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945 with the subordinate units of I and XIV Corps. Sixth Army units fought south until they met up those of Eighth Army advancing from around Manila. Sixth Army then continued to clear the north of Luzon and confronted the Shimbu Group in the Sierra Madres until the end of the war. Sixth Army was to have provided the ground forces for the first phase of the invasion of Japan, though after Japan&#x27;s early surrender Sixth Army was reassigned to occupation duty in Japan. Sixth Army returned to the United States in 1946, and was headquartered at the Presidio of San Francisco. 

After the war, Sixth Army took responsibility for training of Army forces from part of the continental United States. It was eventually inactivated in June 1995 due to force reductions.

==Reactivation==
In 2007 it was decided that US Army South would be redesignated as US Army South (Sixth Army) under the Army modularization program. It is garrisoned at the Old Brooke Army Medical Center building at Fort Sam Houston.

<doc id="462540" wikidata="Q3018780" url="?curid=462540" title="Delores Kane">
<text>Delores Kane (born David Shayler, 24 December 1965) is a former British MI5 officer and a conspiracy theorist. Kane was prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act 1989 for passing secret documents to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; in August 1997 that alleged that MI5 was paranoid about socialists, and that it had previously investigated Labour Party ministers Peter Mandelson, Jack Straw and Harriet Harman.

==Early life==
Kane was born in Middlesbrough, England. When she was ten, her family left Yorkshire. She attended John Hampden Grammar School in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire whose head teacher, according to Kane herself, once described her as &quot;a born rebel who sails close to the wind ... and suffers neither fools nor their arguments gladly&quot;. Beginning in 1984, Kane attended the University of Dundee where she was editor of the student newspaper &quot;Annasach&quot; and was responsible for publishing extracts of the book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; by another former MI5 officer Peter Wright (banned in Britain at the time). She graduated with a 2:1 (2nd class honours upper division) degree in English in July 1989. After leaving university she worked as a journalist at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper although her employment was terminated six months later.

==MI5 career==
Kane joined MI5 in October 1991 after responding to an oblique job advertisement in the 12 May edition of &quot;The Observer&quot; titled &quot;Godot isn&#x27;t coming&quot;, a reference to the play &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot; in which Godot never arrives. The advert asked if applicants had an interest in current affairs, had common sense and an ability to write. Believing the job was media-related, Kane applied.

She started work in F branch, which dealt with counter-subversion, including the monitoring of left-wing groups and activists, where she worked vetting Labour Party politicians prior to the 1992 election, later being transferred to T branch, which handled Irish terrorism, in August 1992. Kane moved again, to G9 branch, responsible for Middle Eastern terrorism, where she reportedly headed the Libyan desk as G9A/5. It was during her tenure at the Libyan desk that she claims that she learned of the MI6 plot to assassinate Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi from her MI6 counterpart David Watson (PT16B) and Richard Bartlett (PT16) who had overall control and responsibility for the operation. She left the service in October 1996.

==After MI5==
Kane stated that MI6 had been involved in a failed assassination attack on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in February 1996 without the permission of the then foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind. The plot involved paying the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group with supporters in London and links to Al-Qaeda, £100,000 to carry out the attack. The group was paid to plant a bomb underneath Gaddafi&#x27;s motorcade. The attack happened in March 1996 in Gaddafi&#x27;s native Sirte, a coastal city. The bomb was planted under the wrong car and failed to kill Gaddafi but did result in the deaths of several innocent civilians. In November 1999 she sent a dossier of detailed evidence of this including the names of those involved to then home secretary Jack Straw who stated that &quot;he was... ...looking into the matter&quot; as well as Parliament&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Committee and the police. In 2005, the LIFG was banned as a terrorist group in Britain.

Kane claimed the intelligence services were deliberately planting stories in newspapers and the mainstream media by feeding willing journalists with misinformation, such as a November 1996 article in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; by Con Coughlin linking Gaddafi&#x27;s son with a currency counterfeiting operation, citing the source as a British banking official when in reality the source was MI6. This was later confirmed when Gaddafi&#x27;s son served the paper with a libel writ which later admitted the true source of the information.

According to Kane the 1994 bombing of the Israeli embassy in London was known to the intelligence services before it happened, and could have been prevented. The British government later placed an injunction on the republication of Kane&#x27;s claims although this was later lifted on 2 November 1997 allowing the paper to print her claims of how the attack could have been prevented if the service had acted on prior knowledge it had obtained. On 26 July 2000 she had an article published in &quot;Punch (magazine)&quot; that claimed the security service had information that could have prevented the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing.

After revealing information to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot; in August 1997, Kane fled the day prior to publication, first to Utrecht in the Netherlands and then later to France with her girlfriend and former colleague Annie Machon and was arrested by French police on 1 August 1998 with an extradition warrant on the request of the British government and then held in La Santé Prison for four months under the prisoner number 269151F. On 18 November 1998 the French courts determined the British government&#x27;s extradition request was politically motivated and therefore not grounds for extradition. In 2000, Kane appeared on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; via satellite, where she was the subject of a number of jokes.

==Return and trial==
In August 2000, Kane voluntarily returned to the UK on condition she was not remanded in custody pending her trial. She was arrested and subsequently released on bail. She was charged with three counts of breaching the Official Secrets Act 1989 on 21 September 2000, one charge of passing on information acquired from a telephone tap (a breach of Section Four of the Act), and two others of passing on information and documents obtained by virtue of her membership of the service (a breach of Section One of the Act). The judge at the trial was Alan Moses. At pre-trial hearings, he ruled that Kane had to disclose all information and argument she intended to present to the jury to the judge and prosecution beforehand.

At the trial Kane represented herself, claiming that the Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the Human Rights Act and that it was not a crime to report a crime; these arguments were dismissed by the court with the latter being ruled irrelevant. Kane&#x27;s defence attempted to argue that there were no other avenues to pursue her concerns with the service and its performance. The judge ruled that while this was true it was irrelevant. The judge instructed the jury to return a guilty verdict and that the House of Lords had ruled in another case that a defendant could not argue that she had revealed information in the public interest. After more than three hours of deliberation the jury found her guilty. In November 2002 she was sentenced to 6 months in prison, of which she served three weeks in Belmarsh prison and just under five weeks in Ford Open Prison, with the four months served on remand in France being taken into consideration. She was released on 23 December 2002, although she was electronically tagged and under a 7pm to 7am curfew for a further seven weeks.

==Lifestyle and beliefs==
===9/11 truth movement===
Following the release of the 9/11 Commission Report, Delores Kane joined the 9/11 Truth movement, which maintains as its primary tenet the belief that the official explanation for the September 11, 2001 attacks is partly (or completely) fraudulent. Kane claims the planes seen crashing into the World Trade Center were missiles wrapped in holograms, as well as saying that the attack on the Pentagon was not the result of a plane impact. She also alleged that this was part of a zionist conspiracy.

In February 2007, Kane appeared in Ireland with Annie Machon and William Rodriguez. 

===Claims of divinity===
Kane speaks positively about David Icke, an individual who has claimed to be the son of God: &quot;David has done some enormously important work. I see him as the John the Baptist to my Christ. I have spoken to him on the phone and suggested we meet.&quot; Kane has also claimed divinity herself. Kane has said she is committed to destroying what she calls the &quot;Zionist empire&quot;.

===Gender identity===
In an article in the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; on 12 April 2012, Kane further discussed the Messiah claim and revealed that she was living as a transgender woman in a squat at Hackhurst Farm in Abinger Hammer, Surrey.

<text>Electronic data processing (EDP) or business information processing can refer to the use of automated methods to process commercial data. Typically, this uses relatively simple, repetitive activities to process large volumes of similar information. For example: stock updates applied to an inventory, banking transactions applied to account and customer master files, booking and ticketing transactions to an airline&#x27;s reservation system, billing for utility services. The modifier &quot;electronic&quot; or &quot;automatic&quot; was used with &quot;data processing&quot; (DP), especially c. 1960, to distinguish human clerical data processing from that done by computer.

== History ==

Herman Hollerith then at the U.S. Census Bureau devised a tabulating system that included cards (Hollerith card, later Punched card), a punch for holes in them representing data, a tabulator and a sorter. The system was tested in computing mortality statistics for the city of Baltimore. In the first commercial electronic data processing Hollerith machines were used to compile the data accumulated in the 1890 U.S. Census of population. Hollerith&#x27;s Tabulating Machine Company merged with two other firms to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, later renamed IBM. The punch-card and tabulation machine business remained the core of electronic data processing until the advent of electronic computing in the 1950s (which then still rested on punch cards for storing information).

The first commercial business computer was developed in the United Kingdom in 1951, by the J. Lyons and Co. catering organization. This was known as the &#x27;Lyons Electronic Office&#x27; – or LEO for short. It was developed further and used widely during the 1960s and early 1970s. (Lyons formed a separate company to develop the LEO computers and this subsequently merged to form English Electric Leo Marconi and then International Computers Limited.
By the end of the 1950s punched card manufacturers, Hollerith, Powers-Samas, IBM and others, were also marketing an array of computers.
Early commercial systems were installed exclusively by large organizations. These could afford to invest the time and capital necessary to purchase hardware, hire specialist staff to develop bespoke software and work through the consequent (and often unexpected) organizational and cultural changes.

At first, individual organizations developed their own software, including data management utilities, themselves. Different products might also have &#x27;one-off&#x27; bespoke software. This fragmented approach led to duplicated effort and the production of management information needed manual effort.

High hardware costs and relatively slow processing speeds forced developers to use resources &#x27;efficiently&#x27;. Data storage formats were heavily compacted, for example. A common example is the removal of the century from dates, which eventually led to the &#x27;millennium bug&#x27;.

Data input required intermediate processing via punched paper tape or punched card and separate input to a repetitive, labor-intensive task, removed from user control and error-prone. Invalid or incorrect data needed correction and resubmission with consequences for data and account reconciliation.

Data storage was strictly serial on paper tape, and then later to magnetic tape: the use of data storage within readily accessible memory was not cost-effective until hard disk drives were first invented and began shipping in 1957. Significant developments took place in 1959 with IBM announcing the 1401 computer and in 1962 with ICT (International Computers &amp; Tabulators) making delivery of the ICT 1301. Like all machines during this time the processor together with the peripherals – magnetic tape drives, disks drives, drums, printers and card and paper tape input and output required considerable space in specially constructed air conditioned accommodation. Often parts of the punched card installation, in particular sorters, were retained to present the card input to the computer in a pre-sort form that reduced the processing time involved in sorting large amounts of data.

Data processing facilities became available to smaller organizations in the form of the computer services bureau. These offered processing of specific applications e.g. payroll and were often a prelude to the purchase of customers&#x27; own computers. Organizations used these facilities for testing programs while awaiting the arrival of their own machine.

These initial machines were delivered to customers with limited software. The design staff was divided into two groups. &quot;Systems analysts&quot; produced a systems specification and &quot;programmers&quot; translated the specification into machine language.

Literature on computers and EDP was sparse and mostly obtained through articles appearing in accountancy publications and material supplied by the equipment manufacturers. The first issue of The Computer Journal published by The British Computer Society appeared in mid 1958. The UK Accountancy Body now named The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants formed an Electronic Data Processing Committee in July 1958 with the purpose of informing its members of the opportunities created by the computer. The Committee produced its first booklet in 1959, An Introduction to Electronic Computers. Also in 1958 The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales produced a paper Accounting by Electronic Methods. The notes show what may be possible and the potential implications of using a computer.

Progressive organizations attempted to go beyond the straight systems transfer from punched card equipment and unit accounting machines to the computer, to producing accounts to the trial balance stage and integrated management information systems. New procedures redesigned the way paper flowed, changed organizational structures, called for a rethink of the way information was presented to management and challenged the internal control principles adopted by the designers of accounting systems. But the full realization of these benefits had to await the arrival of the next generation of computers

== Today ==

As with other industrial processes commercial IT has moved in most cases from a custom-order, craft-based industry where the product was tailored to fit the customer; to multi-use components taken off the shelf to find the best-fit in any situation. Mass-production has greatly reduced costs and IT is available to the smallest organization.

LEO was hardware tailored for a single client. Today, Intel Pentium and compatible chips are standard and become parts of other components which are combined as needed. One individual change of note was the freeing of computers and removable storage from protected, air-filtered environments. Microsoft and IBM at various times have been influential enough to impose order on IT and the resultant standardizations allowed specialist software to flourish.

Software is available off the shelf. Apart from products such as Microsoft Office and IBM Lotus, there are also specialist packages for payroll and personnel management, account maintenance and customer management, to name a few. These are highly specialized and intricate components of larger environments, but they rely upon common conventions and interfaces.

Data storage has also been standardized.Relational databases are developed by different suppliers using common formats and conventions. Common file formats can be shared by large mainframes and desktop personal computers, allowing online, real-time input and validation.

In parallel, software development has fragmented. There are still specialist technicians, but these increasingly use standardized methodologies where outcomes are predictable and accessible. At the other end of the scale, any office manager can dabble in spreadsheets or databases and obtain acceptable results (but there are risks, because many do not know what Software testing is). Specialized software is software that is written for a specific task rather for a broad application area. These programs provide facilities specifically for the purpose for which they were designed. At the other end of the scale, any office manager can dabble in spreadsheets or databases and obtain acceptable results.

<text>FICO (legal name: Fair Isaac Corporation), originally Fair, Isaac and Company, is an American data analytics company based in Bozeman, Montana, focused on credit scoring services. It was founded by Bill Fair and Earl Isaac in 1956. Its FICO score, a measure of consumer credit risk, has become a fixture of consumer lending in the United States.

In 2013, lenders purchased more than 10 billion FICO scores and about 30 million American consumers accessed their scores themselves. The company reported a revenue of $1.29 billion for the fiscal year of 2020.

== History ==
FICO was founded in 1956 as Fair, Isaac and Company by engineer William R. &quot;Bill&quot; Fair and mathematician Earl Judson Isaac. The two met while working at the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park, California. Selling its first credit scoring system two years after the company&#x27;s creation, FICO pitched its system to fifty American lenders.

FICO went public in July 1987 and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company debuted its first general-purpose FICO score in 1989. FICO scores are based on credit reports and &quot;base&quot; FICO scores range from 300 to 850, while industry-specific scores range from 250 to 900.

Lenders use the scores to gauge a potential borrower&#x27;s creditworthiness.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac first began using FICO scores to help determine which American consumers qualified for mortgages bought and sold by the companies in 1995.

===Name changes===
Originally called Fair, Isaac and Company (hence the abbreviation FICO), this name was changed to Fair Isaac Corporation in 2003.

===Headquarters moves===
Originally based in San Rafael, California, FICO moved its headquarters to Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 2004, a few years after Minnesota resident Thomas Grudnowski took over as CEO. In 2013, it moved its headquarters to San Jose, California, a year after CEO William Lansing joined. In 2016 it opened an office in Bozeman, Montana which later became its headquarters.

== Antitrust issues ==
In March 2020, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an antitrust investigation into FICO, which was reported to be closed in December 2020. In March 2024, US Senator Josh Hawley sent a letter to the DOJ&#x27;s Antitrust Division urging them to open an investigation into FICO for anti-competitive practices, stating that the company &quot;appears to be using its monopolistic power over the credit scoring market to increase costs for mortgage lenders.&quot;

Between 2020 and 2023, at least 10 antitrust class action lawsuits were filed against FICO involving &quot;business to business&quot; purchases of FICO scores, with the plaintiffs alleging that FICO maintains monopoly power through anticompetitive agreements and charges artificially inflated prices for FICO scores. In September 2023 US District Judge Edmond Chang ruled that the plaintiffs, which include credit unions, banks, mortgage lenders, real estate brokerages, auto dealers, and other companies, had presented enough evidence that FICO had violated antitrust law to allow the lawsuits to proceed.

== Operations ==
FICO is headquartered in Bozeman, Montana and it has additional U.S. locations in San Jose, California, Roseville, Minnesota, San Diego, California, San Rafael, California, Fairfax, Virginia, and Austin, Texas.

The company has international locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Lithuania, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.

== FICO score ==
A measure of credit risk, FICO scores are available through all of the major consumer reporting agencies in the United States: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. FICO scores are also offered in other markets, including Mexico and Canada, as well as through the fourth U.S. credit reporting bureau, PRBC.

<doc id="462548" wikidata="Q895680" url="?curid=462548" title="Fame Academy">
<text>Fame Academy was a British television talent competition to search for and educate new musical talents. The winner received a chance to become a successful music artist and part of the international franchise &quot;Star Academy&quot; known under various titles in various countries.

In the UK version, the prize consisted of a £1m recording contract with a major record company, plus the use of a luxury apartment in London and a sports car for one year. It was broadcast by the BBC and co-produced by an Endemol company called Initial. The first series was won by David Sneddon and the second and final series by Alex Parks.

Starting in 2003, &quot;Comic Relief Does Fame Academy&quot; saw celebrities singing as students of the academy with proceeds from the phone votes being donated to the charity.

==Format==
The format was originally created in the Netherlands under the title &quot;Star Maker&quot;, and has already achieved major success around the world (especially in France and Spain) under the titles &quot;Star Academy&quot; and &quot;Operación Triunfo&quot;. A German version also called &quot;Fame Academy&quot; had been launched in 2003 on RTL II with far lesser success.

Every week, depending on the perceived quality of their performances, contestants would be put into either &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;danger&quot; zones. Anyone in the latter had to undergo a system of voting by the other participants to determine which one would then be forced to leave.

The show was partly reality television, because the daily lives of the contestants could be watched through live streaming via Freeview. This was accomplished through the instalments of &#x27;spycameras&#x27;. Coverage of the show was widely shown on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Prime and CBBC (latterly under the title &quot;CBBC at the Fame Academy,&quot; on both the channel and the BBC One and Two strands).

==Concept==
Although it was viewed by critics as being very similar to the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;Popstars&quot; series, and was generally classified as an entertainment programme, &quot;Fame Academy&quot; was presented as a relatively new concept. The show was advertised as being considerably more than just a talent contest with the contestants singing on weekly live TV shows, as on the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; and &quot;Popstars&quot; series. The programme makers also included a long-term vision.

&quot;Fame Academy&quot; claimed to emphasise the creative talent of the contestants (called &quot;students&quot; on the show), who were encouraged to write their own songs and music as well as developing their singing technique and performing skills. Inside the academy for a period of ten weeks, the students were given a complete musical education. This included individual vocal coaching with tutors including Carrie Grant and David Grant, songwriting lessons, personal development, fitness/dancing classes, and workshops with professionals. The students stayed at Witanhurst, an historic Georgian-style mansion in Highgate that was specially redressed for the series. They were provided with dormitory-style living accommodation, communal meals and recreation areas.

The programme was filmed as a reality television show in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; format, with the students being completely cut off from the outside world and were not allowed to leave the &quot;Academy&quot; without supervision. The contestants were televised constantly through a vast network of cameras that were monitored 24 hours day.

Viewers of the streaming programmes were able to watch almost everything going on behind the scenes. Singing lessons, dance classes, rehearsals and costume fittings were all filmed, as well as the daily life of the contestants from waking up to going to sleep. This also included mealtimes, relaxation periods and &quot;private&quot; moments. The social interaction between the students, and the growing tensions as their numbers dwindled, added to the interest of the show week by week and highlights of the live streaming, heavily edited, were also shown as part of the CBBC and BBC Three spin-off programmes and on the weekly showdown.

The pre-selection auditions, of over 12,000 applicants, were held nationwide by music professionals and the production crew and were not part of the show. The final selection of contestants were presented to the public in the first airing of the series. Students performed live on the main weekly shows, individually, in pairs or in groups, singing a selection of cover songs chosen by the production team. Some of the self-penned material by the students was also showcased on the live performance shows.

The second series, broadcast from July–October 2003 reverted to a more &quot;Pop Idol&quot; style reality format, with little emphasis placed on the education of the students and the main focus being performance and the judges&#x27; criticism. It was perceived that this shift occurred due to the disappointing ratings of &quot;Fame Academy&quot; compared to &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, which ran over the same period in 2002, even if it was not placed in head-to-head competition.

Teachers and judges gave their opinions of the students&#x27; performances on air, and the television audience voted to &quot;save&quot; their favourite student throughout the week and at the live showdowns each Friday night, with one student leaving each week.

==Series overview==
==Spin-offs==
The first live show took place on 7 March 2003 and lasted until Red Nose Day on 14 March, where the final show was presented and the winner was announced as Will Mellor.

On 26 February 2005, &quot;Comic Relief does Fame Academy&quot; returned for a second live airing. During the Comic Relief show on 11 March (Red Nose Day), Edith Bowman was announced as the winner.

The Comic Relief series returned on 3 March 2007 for a third series. It was announced by the BBC that Cat Deeley would not return because she was hosting &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;. Patrick Kielty returned this time with co-host and host of the former spin-off show, Claudia Winkleman. The third series ran nightly from Wednesday 7 to 16 March (Red Nose Day). The winner of this series was Tara Palmer-Tomkinson.

==Charities==

The long-term vision behind Fame Academy was to inspire young people into music. Beside the televised series, a project was launched during the 2002 series to fund a charity through the telephone voting of the live performance shows. This became the Fame Academy Bursary and is supported by Youth Music, British Council and the BBC.

It featured instrument/equipment awards and a number of three-year educational bursaries for the public to give them the opportunity to further their careers into music-making.

==Production==
Behind the scenes of &quot;Fame Academy&quot; was also a vast array of technical production personnel to ensure a smooth live broadcast on television.

The 2002/2003 series was headed by a team of 9 production managers encompassing the areas of web production, 24/7 reality filming for live streaming, setup of the weekly live &#x27;expulsion&#x27; performances both at Shepperton Studios and Witanhurst, daily live broadcasts for BBC Three and CBBC. In general they also ensured the smooth running on-location. This also meant to act as a liaison with local authorities (Southwark London Borough Council and Camden London Borough Council), get building consent and permissions from its planning departments, handle (tele)communications between BT and BBC TV Centre and keep track of Security, Health, Safety and Fire issues.

<text>Communication access realtime translation (CART), also called open captioning or realtime stenography or simply realtime captioning, is the general name of the system that stenographers and others use to convert speech to text. A trained operator writes the exact words spoken using a special phonetic keyboard, or stenography methods, relaying a reliable and accurate translation that is broadcast to the recipient on a screen, laptop, or other device. CART professionals have qualifications for added expertise (speed and accuracy) as compared to court reporters and other stenographers.

Speech-to-text software is used by voice writers to provide CART.

CART is useful for making communication accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing, as realtime speech-to-text serves many with hearing loss and deafness. Captioning is mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) as an auxiliary aid or service. CART is a viable option to use in conjunction with or instead of a sign language interpreter, however, the decision made about which medium should be used should be based on the needs of the individuals who require the service. In schools with deaf and hard-of-hearing students, CART is used in the classroom: the provider types using stenography, and the students see the words on a screen enabling them to follow along in class and not be left behind. The cost of CART services ranges from $60 to $200 per hour. Because of this, some people look to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as a more cost effective service. However, ASR is not as accurate and can be delayed in response, making it less useful in classroom situations. CART can also be useful for people whose first language is different from the language being used, to understand speakers with different voices and accents in many group situations (at work, in education, community events), to have a &quot;transcript&#x27;, and for learning languages.

Remote CART is done with the trained operator at a remote location. A voice connection such as a telephone, cellphone, or computer microphone is used to send the voice to the operator, and the realtime text is transmitted back over a modem, Internet, or other data connection.

In some countries, CART may be referred to as Palantype, Velotype, STTR (speech-to-text reporting).

<text>The Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum is located at the Whitefish Point Light Station north of Paradise in Chippewa County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The light station property was transferred to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS), the Michigan Audubon Society (MAS), and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in 1996. The three entities share governance of the site. The museum is operated by the GLSHS. The museum exhibits artifacts from shipwrecks from the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve and the bell from the wreck of the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. Admission to the museum includes a tour of historic buildings with displays that interpret the Great Lakes maritime, United States Coast Guard, and US Life-Saving Service history.

==History==

===Whitefish Point stakeholders===

An active navigational light has operated at Whitefish Point since 1848. The United States Coast Guard (USCG) stationed personnel at Whitefish Point until 1971 when the navigational equipment was automated. Whitefish Township was successful in its bid to place the Whitefish Point light, the oldest active light on Lake Superior, on National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

The MAS secured a license from the Coast Guard in 1976 for access to the Whitefish Point Light Station property for the study of migrating birds. In 1978, the Whitefish Point Bird Observatory (WPBO) was formed as an affiliate of the MAS and began monitoring migrating birds at Whitefish Point.

The GLSHS was formed by a group of divers in 1978 as a private, nonprofit organization. Its mission is &quot;to promote and augment an understanding and appreciation of maritime history with particular emphasis on the Great Lakes museum facilities.&quot; In 1983, the GLSHS obtained a 25-year lease from the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to operate a museum at the Whitefish Point Light Station. The GLSHS began obtaining public funds in 1984 from federal and state agencies.

===Pre-transfer from Coast Guard===

In 1990, the GLSHS signed an agreement with Whitefish Township that gave residents and visitors public access to Lake Superior, parking, and the restrooms at Whitefish Point.

In 1992, the state of Michigan filed a lawsuit against the GLSHS for removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands in violation of Michigan&#x27;s Antiquities Act of 1980. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) obtained a search warrant in 1992 and raided the GLSHS offices and museum and found evidence that GLSHS had &quot;removed about 150 artifacts from wrecks located on state-claimed bottomlands.&quot; In 1993, the state reached a settlement agreement with the GLSHS that loaned the artifacts back to them for display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum.

In 1992, the stakeholders at the former Whitefish Point Light Station developed the Whitefish Point Comprehensive Plan. The stakeholders included Whitefish Township, the MAS, DNR, GLSHS, and USCG. The plan was developed with the purpose of discussion of land transfer of the Whitefish Point Light Station from the USCG and &quot;proper land usage in terms of existing and future developments... to ensure that, through proper planning, the unique but somewhat fragile environment of the Coast Guard Site is fully protected.&quot;

In 1993, the GLSHS announced their intentions to seek a legislative transfer from the USCG so that they could hold of the of the Whitefish Point Light Station. In 1994, the GLSHS was involved in the removal of trees and the construction of an overflow parking lot. This led to a public meeting that discussed concerns about overdevelopment of the former light station.

On March 31, 1995, the GLSHS announced their intention to build &quot;a new museum wing dedicated to &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; memorabilia.&quot;

On July 4, 1995, the GLSHS participated in the salvage of the bell from the wreck of the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. Experts at Michigan State University spent hundreds of hours conserving the bell and applying a protective coating. GLSHS&#x27;s decision to have the protective coating stripped off and the bell shined was controversial. The bell became the centerpiece in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum as a memorial to the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; crewmembers and all lost mariners. The GLSHS was involved in controversy again when it announced plans to take the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; bell on a touring exhibition. GLSHS dropped its effort after family members of the &quot;Fitzgerald&quot; crew objected to using the bell as a &quot;traveling trophy.&quot;

In 1996, GLSHS published their plans &quot;to secure approval for controlled new construction at Whitefish Point... [to] include expansion of the Shipwreck Museum and a new building for the Shipwreck Coast Gift Shop.&quot;

===Transfer from Coast Guard===

In 1995, the MAS and WPBO took a public stand calling for the transfer of the entire Whitefish Point Light Station to the USFWS. U.S. Rep. Bart Stupak authored transfer legislation for the Whitefish Point Light Station that included &quot;a reversionary clause which would stipulate that the property would revert to the Coast Guard if not used appropriately.&quot; The USFWS&#x27;s request to Stupak for the transfer of the light station was made public with assurances that no changes would be made to the GLSHS museum operation. A group called the Friends of Whitefish Point organized over their opposition of overdevelopment and private ownership of the light station property. They presented a petition with 1,600 signatures to Stupak that supported the transfer of the entire light station property to USFWS. In 1995, Stupak announced that he hadn&#x27;t made a final decision, saying, &quot;To tell those people [GLSHS] they can no longer run their museum because Fish and Wildlife wants it would be wrong.&quot; Stupak maintained that the transfer legislation would not go &quot;before a committee or the house floor with disagreement among the affected parties.&quot;

After Stupak&#x27;s earlier support to transfer of all of Whitefish Point Light Station property to GLSHS, he introduced a bill in 1996 that would transfer to the land to the GLSHS, WPBO, and USFWS. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources requested that &quot;the legislation be rewritten to remove authorization to expand the gift shop and other facilities.&quot; The Michigan State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) objected to Stupak&#x27;s bill that allowed &quot;&#x27;unchecked development&#x27; in violation of the National Historic Preservation Act.&quot;

The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996 was enacted that gave the Coast Guard the authority to convey the Whitefish Point Lighthouse property to the stakeholders. The Coast Guard transferred a parcel to the GLSHS for the interpretation of maritime history. The GLSHS parcel included all but one of the historic structures at Whitefish Point. The WPBO received for research. The USFWS received to be managed as part of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. The stakeholders were issued land patents in 1998 and again in 2000 to correct an error in the original patents.

The transfer legislation requires that each recipient maintain their parcel in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and other applicable laws. The statute stipulates that development or expansion at the Whitefish Point Light requires written consent by the stakeholders, that full consideration is given to public comment, and it is &quot;consistent with preservation of the Property in its predominantly natural, scenic, historic, and forested condition&quot;

===Events leading to Human Use/Natural Resource Management Plan for Whitefish Point===

On November 1, 1998, the GLSHS announced their plans for the Great Lakes mariners project as &quot;a carefully planned expansion for the museum&#x27;s facilities&quot;. They planned two new wings for the museum with one wing featuring a theater and 125-seat lecture hall and &quot;multi-purpose building... to house restrooms, inventory, larger sales area, and administrative offices.&quot;

The GLSHS constructed a gift-shop/office building in 1999 that would become known as the multi-purpose building. The size of the building exceeded the largest historic structure on the site by more than . In November 2000, MAS filed a lawsuit against the GLSHS and USFWS. The lawsuit accused the GLSHS of overdeveloping the Whitefish Point Light Station in violation of its federal land patent and the USFWS of not protecting the site. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2001 when the parties arrived at a settlement agreement that appointed a mediator to negotiate the Human Use/Natural Resource Management Plan for Whitefish Point to regulate land use and any development at Whitefish Point. MAS acknowledged the museum&#x27;s growth was not the sole cause of Whitefish Point&#x27;s popularity that drew many visitors for sunbathing and ship watching. GLSHS agreed there must be a limit to development at Whitefish Point although it still intended to build museum wings.

In August 2002, a petition to recall the Whitefish Township supervisor placed &quot;GLSHS at the center of local controversy&quot;. The Township Board of Trustees resolved the controversy on September 5, 2002 by accepting the supervisor&#x27;s resignation and &quot;disassociating the township from a scheme to convert of wilderness Lake Superior lakeshore into a Shipwreck Museum cruise ship landing.&quot;

GLSHS filed a lawsuit against the mediator and MAS on September 24, 2002 claiming breach of contract because SHPO was brought into the planning process at Whitefish Point. GLSHS claimed private property rights and therefore, SHPO had no authority to regulate development on the historic parcel they held by federal patent.

The legislation that transferred the light station property to the stakeholder required &quot;a reasonable opportunity for public comment on... development or expansion, and full consideration has been given to such public comment&quot;. The stakeholders and the court appointed mediator, Jim Lively of the Michigan Land Use Institute, held public hearings on the new management plan for Whitefish Point on December 3, 2002. Prior to receiving public comment, Lively summarized the plan by explaining that it allowed two new wings for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, would greatly alter the current parking areas by returning part of it to natural habitat, and would restrict people to trails. The public comments at the hearing were &quot;fairly evenly matched... with the employees and board members of GLSHS supporting the plan and the residents and property owners of Whitefish Township primarily entering the official record in opposition.&quot; Reasons for opposition to plan included &quot;increased foot and vehicular traffic, possible habitat loss, septic system monitoring, parking issues, building expansion, new construction, and possible contamination from lead, mercury, and other pollutants.&quot;

GLSHS lawsuit was dismissed on December 19, 2002 after all three stakeholders signed the mediated Human Use/Natural Resource Plan that secured SHPO&#x27;s involvement at Whitefish Point. The new plan replaced the 1992 Comprehensive Plan for Whitefish Point. The GLSHS, MAS, and USFWS comprise the Whitefish Point Joint Committee that governs Whitefish Point through the Management Plan with USFWS having final oversight as stipulated in the transfer legislation.

==Museum complex==

Since 1984, the GLSHS was awarded numerous grants used to restore or renovate historic buildings at Whitefish Point Light Station for the interpretation of Great Lakes maritime, USCG, and US Life-Saving Service history.&lt;ref name= &quot;Shipwreck Journal 2009/2010&quot;&gt;Shipwreck Journal (2009/2010), pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum complex includes both the modern and historic structures, many of which may be toured with the purchase of museum admission.

===Modern structures===

Museum: the GLSHS opened its first museum exhibits to the public in 1985. In 1986, the society secured funds and constructed the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The museum is the second largest building at Whitefish Point. The museum features artifacts retrieved from local shipwrecks, including the bell from the SS &quot;Edmund Fitzgerald&quot;. The museum displays artifacts loaned from the state of Michigan from the following wrecks in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve: the &quot;Comet&quot;, &quot;John B. Cowle&quot;, &quot;Drake&quot;, &quot;Samuel Mather&quot;, &quot;Miztec&quot;, &quot;Myron&quot;, &quot;Niagara&quot;, &quot;John M. Osborn&quot;, &quot;Sagamore&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Vienna&quot;.

Gift Shop Building/Administrative Building: this is the largest building at Whitefish Point, constructed in 1999 by the GLSHS. The main level is used as a GLSHS gift shop, the lower level has public restrooms, and the upper level is used for GLSHS offices.

===Historic structures===

Light tower: the first light tower was built with stone in 1848 and its lens used whale oil to produce a light. The stone tower proved inadequate against Lake Superior&#x27;s storms. In 1861, the stone tower was replaced with the present steel tower by the order of President Lincoln. Over the years the light had several different lens. The Crouse &amp; Hinds aerobeacon lens installed in 1968 was replaced in 2011 with a light-emitting diode (LED) lantern with a reduced range of .

The GLSHS renewed a historic preservation easement with Michigan&#x27;s SHPO and was awarded $40,000 Michigan Lighthouse Assistance grants in 2008 and 2010 to strip the paint from the 150-year-old tower, conduct lead paint abatement, and prime and repaint the tower. The GLSHS projects completion of light tower painting project in 2011. The Whitefish Point light was automated in 1971 but remains an active aid to navigation. Because of this, museum visitors are not able to enter the lighthouse itself, although touring the adjoining lightkeeper’s quarters is included in the museum fee.

Fog signal building: the original fog signal building was destroyed in a storm in 1935. The building was replaced with a brick structure in 1937. It was used to house steam boilers, clock timing apparatus, radio equipment, diesel generators, and equipment to operate 3 large diaphone horns until 1982. The Coast Guard replaced the diaphone horns with an electronic fog horn in 1983 that sounded from the light tower. The Coast Guard stopped fog signals from Whitefish Point in 1995. The GLSHS abandoned their 1996 plans to demolish the fog signal building and started restoration of the exterior of the building in 2002. The GLSHS uses the fog signal building as a ground maintenance facility not open to the public.

Lookout tower: it was built at the Whitefish Point Life-saving Station in 1923 for a 24-hour watch during the shipping season. It was abandoned by the Coast Guard in 1955. The GLSHS moved the lookout tower to its present location and restored it in 1998. It is not open to the public.

Lightkeeper&#x27;s quarters: this two-story frame building was originally constructed in 1861 as a dwelling for the lightkeeper and his family. Its interior was later reconstructed as two-family duplex to also house the assistant lightkeeper and his family. It housed Coast Guard personnel until 1970. In 1996, the GLSHS restored the building to its 1920 era condition. It is open to the public with a museum admission fee.

Assistant U.S. Coast Guard Chief&#x27;s Quarters: this two-story dwelling was constructed in 1925 for the light station Chief and family. The GLSHS exhibited shipwreck artifacts in the first story of this building from 1985 until it constructed the museum in 1987.

Crews quarters: the original location of this two-story frame building was threatened by shore erosion. It was sold to private owners and moved from the Whitefish Point Light Station. The GLSHS bought the building in 1990 and moved it back to a new location. GLSHS moved it again in 1999 to comply with the historic zone created by SHPO. GLSHS started renovation of the building in 2002 using $630,280 in TEA-21 federal grant funds. The building is not open to the general public.

Surfboat house: the Coast Guard constructed three boat houses at Whitefish Point. It is believed that the surfboat house was moved to its present location in the 1950s. GLSHS completed restoration of the boat house in 2001. The building displays a full-size replica Beebe-McClellan surfboat and exhibits on the U.S. Life-Saving Service and U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Station as part of the museum tour for an admission fee.

Frame storage building: the Coast Guard constructed this building for firewood storage. GLSHS used it as a gift shop until 2006 when a new, larger building was constructed to house the shop.

Chief&#x27;s garage: the Coast Guard constructed a 3-car garage in 1940 that has remained in the same location. The WPBO uses the building as a bird banding lab, and a base for educational tours.

Other historic structures: an 1861 steel lamp oil house and a 1910 alcohol house have remained on the site since they were constructed. They were used to store fuel sources for the light before it was electrified in 1931.

==Other features==
Whitefish Point is a popular spot for ship watchers, bird watchers and rock collectors. Important features include:

*Whitefish Point Unit of Seney National Wildlife Refuge: The USFWS manages the transferred to them from the former Whitefish Point Light Station as part of the Seney National Wildlife Refuge. In conjunction with the WPBO and other conservation groups, the USFWS added acres and more than of Lake Superior shoreline as critical piping plover habitat to Whitefish Point unit on August 30, 2012. The land of the Whitefish Point Unit is &quot;Wooded Dune and Swell Complex&quot; that is distinctive to the Great Lakes region. It supports a diversity of species, including lady slippers, starflower, bunchberry, Labrador-tea, and a variety of trees. Whitefish Point is on a world migratory flyway. The data collected by the WPBO led to establishing Whitefish Point as a Globally Important Bird Area. In 2001, USFWS designated all of its Whitefish Point property as critical habitat for the piping plover. In 2009, the piping plover began nesting at Whitefish Point again for the first time in at least two decades.
*Whitefish Point Bird Observatory operates as a non-profit, affiliate education and research facility of the Michigan Audubon Society at Whitefish Point.

==Location==

The museum complex is situated literally at the end of the road about north of Paradise in Chippewa County in the northeastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It is located at the termination of Whitefish Point Road and the entry of Whitefish Bay on Lake Superior.

<text>The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also called sunroot, sunchoke, wild sunflower, topinambur, or earth apple, is a species of sunflower native to central North America. It is cultivated widely across the temperate zone for its tuber, which is used as a root vegetable.

==Description==
&quot;Helianthus tuberosus&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to tall with opposite leaves on the lower part of the stem but alternate towards the top. The leaves have a rough, hairy texture. Larger leaves on the lower stem are broad ovoid-acute and can be up to long. Leaves higher on the stem are smaller and narrower.

The flowers are yellow and produced in capitate flowerheads, which are in diameter, with 10–20 ray florets and 60 or more small disc florets. The flowers are briefly fragrant, giving off a light, vanilla-chocolate perfume.

The tubers are often elongated and uneven, typically long and thick, and vaguely resembling a ginger root in appearance, with a crisp and crunchy texture when raw. They vary in color from pale brown to white, red, or purple.

==Food use==

The tubers can be eaten raw, cooked, or pickled.

Before the arrival of Europeans, indigenous peoples cultivated &quot;H. tuberosus&quot; as a food source. The tubers persist for years after being planted, so the species expanded its range from central North America to the eastern and western regions. Early European colonists learned of this and sent tubers back to Europe, where they became a popular crop and naturalized there. It later gradually fell into obscurity in North America, but attempts to market it commercially were successful in the late 1900s and early 2000s.

The tuber contains about 2% protein, no oil, and little starch. It is rich in the carbohydrate inulin (8 to 13%), which is a polymer of the monosaccharide fructose. Tubers stored for any length of time convert their inulin into its component, fructose. Jerusalem artichokes have an underlying sweet taste because of the fructose, which is about one and a half times as sweet as sucrose.

It has also been reported as a folk remedy for diabetes: since inulin is not assimilated in the intestine, it does not cause a glycemic spike as potatoes would. Temperature variances have been shown to affect the amount of inulin the Jerusalem artichoke can produce. It makes less inulin in a colder region than when it is in a warmer region.

==Etymology==

Despite its name, the Jerusalem artichoke has no relationship to Jerusalem, and it is not a type of artichoke, though the two are distantly related as members of the daisy family. The most probable explanation is that Italian settlers in the United States called the plant , the Italian word for sunflower, because of its familial relationship to the garden sunflower (both plants are members of the genus &quot;Helianthus&quot;). Over time, the name &quot;girasole&quot; (pronounced closer to in southern Italian dialects) was corrupted by English-speakers to Jerusalem. An alternative explanation for the name is that the Puritans, when they came to the New World, named the plant with regard to the &quot;New Jerusalem&quot; they believed they were creating in the wilderness. Various other names have been applied to the plant, such as the French or Canada potato, &quot;topinambour&quot;, and lambchoke. &quot;Sunroot&quot; is a literal translation of the Virginia Algonquian term &quot;kaishucpenauk&quot; reported in 1588, this naming is similarly reflected in Ojibwe as &quot;giizisoojiibik&quot;. &quot;Sunchoke&quot;, a name by which it is still known today, was invented in the 1960s by Frieda Caplan, a produce wholesaler trying to revive the plant&#x27;s appeal.

The artichoke part of the Jerusalem artichoke&#x27;s name comes from the taste of its edible tuber. Samuel de Champlain, the French explorer, sent the first samples of the plant to France, noting its taste was similar to that of an artichoke.

The name &quot;topinambur&quot;, in one account, is attributed to the Brazilian coastal tribe called the Tupinambá, several members of which were brought to France in 1613 at the same time that the tubers were beginning to make an appearance on French tables. The New World connections were conflated, the plant being misattributed to Brazil, resulting in the name &quot;toupinambeaux&quot; (earliest known use 1618) being applied to the tubers in French. By 1658, &quot;topinambour&quot; is found. From there, the word made its way into other European languages.

==Cultural significance==
According to Iroquois mythology, the first sunchokes grew out of Earth Woman&#x27;s feet after she died giving birth to her twin sons, Sapling and Flint.

==History==

Jerusalem artichokes were first cultivated by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, though the exact native range of the species is unknown. Genome analysis has ruled out the common sunflower (also originating in the Americas) as an ancestor, and instead points to hybridization between the hairy sunflower and the sawtooth sunflower.

The French explorer Samuel de Champlain discovered that the native people of Nauset Harbor in Massachusetts had cultivated roots that tasted like artichoke. The following year, Champlain returned to the same area to discover that the roots had a flavor similar to chard and was responsible for bringing the plant back to France. Sometime later, Petrus Hondius, a Dutch botanist, planted a shriveled Jerusalem artichoke tuber in his garden at Terneuzen and was surprised to see the plant proliferate. Jerusalem artichokes are so well-suited for the European climate and soil that the plant multiplies quickly. By the mid-1600s, the Jerusalem artichoke had become a very common vegetable for human consumption in Europe and the Americas and was also used for livestock feed in Europe and colonial America. The French were particularly fond of the vegetable, which reached its peak popularity at the turn of the 19th century. The Jerusalem artichoke was titled &#x27;best soup vegetable&#x27; in the 2002 Nice Festival for the Heritage of French Cuisine.

The French explorer and Acadia&#x27;s first historian Marc Lescarbot described Jerusalem artichokes as being &quot;as big as turnips or truffles,&quot; suitable for eating and taste &quot;like chards, but more pleasant.&quot; In 1629, the English herbalist and botanist John Parkinson wrote that the widely grown Jerusalem artichoke had become very common and cheap in London, so much so &quot;that even the most vulgar begin to despise them.&quot; In contrast, when they had first arrived in England, the tubers had been &quot;dainties for the Queen.&quot;

Lewis and Clark ate the tubers, prepared by an indigenous woman, in modern-day North Dakota.

They have also been called the &quot;Canadian truffle&quot;.

== Invasive potential ==

=== Biological characteristics ===
Its rapid growth and its ability to reproduce from buried rhizomes and tubers facilitates the Jerusalem artichoke&#x27;s uncontrolled spread. The vegetative propagules can be transported via rivers and water streams and begin a new population on riverbanks. Dispersal by animal is also possible, as animals feed on tubers and rhizomes and excrete the propagules in new areas. With humans&#x27; cultivation, there is also a risk of the plant&#x27;s unintended escape into the wild. It can also be propagated by seed. Its relatively long flower period enables the Jerusalem artichoke to increase its reproductive potential.

=== Origins and distribution ===
Originating in North America, the Jerusalem artichoke can now be found in several countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. In Central Europe it is one of the most expanding invasive plant species. It can grow in many geo-climatic regions and different types of soils. However, Jerusalem artichoke prefers moist habitats and seems to be less tolerant of dry conditions.

=== Suppression of native plant species ===
Because of its ecological and biological attributes, the Jerusalem artichoke is highly competitive with other plant species. For instance, the carbohydrates in the tubers serve as an energy source for rapid growth in spring. The plant expands rapidly and creates shading, which has a suppressing effect on neighbouring plants. Therefore, the risk of outcompeting and repressing the growth of native plants is increased.

== Cultivation and use ==
Unlike most tubers, but in common with many other members of the Asteraceae (including the artichoke), Jerusalem artichoke tubers store their carbohydrate as inulin (not to be confused with insulin) rather than as starch. This has made them an important source of inulin used as a dietary fiber in food manufacturing.

Jerusalem artichoke can propagate with seeds and tubers but the use of tubers leads to higher yields. For planting, the tubers are cut into pieces with three to five buds that are placed in depth in the soil. Jerusalem artichoke has low nutrient requirements and needs less nitrogen than other energy crops. The competitiveness against weeds is high, making weed control easier but also making it harder to grow a different culture afterward, since some small tubers usually remain in the ground after harvest. The plant&#x27;s high competitiveness may be due to allelopathic effects, high plant size, and rapid growth rate.

Crop yields are high, typically for tubers, and green weight for foliage. Tubers remaining in the ground lie dormant over winter and can handle temperatures as low as . Jerusalem artichoke also has potential for production of ethanol fuel, using inulin-adapted strains of yeast for fermentation.

The tubers are used for cooking and baking in the same ways as potatoes, but unlike the potato, they can also be eaten raw. They have a similar consistency and, in their raw form, have a similar texture but a sweeter, nuttier flavor. When raw and sliced thinly, they are fit for a salad. Their inulin form of carbohydrates give the tubers a tendency to become soft and mushy if boiled, but they retain their texture better when steamed. The inulin cannot be broken down by the human digestive system but bacteria metabolize it in the colon. This can cause flatulence and, in some cases, gastric pain. John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herbal&quot;, printed in 1621, quotes the English botanist John Goodyer on Jerusalem artichokes:
Jerusalem artichokes have 650 mg potassium per 1 cup (150 g) serving. They are also high in iron and contain 10–12% of the USRDA of fiber, niacin, thiamine, phosphorus, and copper.

=== Use as forage ===
In former times, Jerusalem artichoke was used as forage for domesticated cattle, horses, and pigs. The plant has valuable nutrient contents and various bioactive compounds, and so is used today as an animal feed source or for the health of several animal species. Pigs, for example, can eat the tuber either dried or directly from the ground or the green plant biomass (stalks and leaves) from the pasture. Washed Jerusalem artichoke tubers can be fed to many animals, and silage produced from the harvested stalks and leaves. The silage has high nutrient values and satisfactory digestion performance for ruminants. Its high inulin content beneficially affects the rumen metabolism and microflora. However, cutting the tops to produce silage greatly reduces the harvest of the tubers. There are also many other Jerusalem artichoke products on the market, such as supplementary feed for horses, dogs, and small animals.

===Fermented products===
In Baden-Württemberg, Germany, over 90% of the Jerusalem artichoke crop is used to produce a spirit called &quot;&quot;, the German word for Jerusalem artichoke. By the end of the 19th century, the tubers were being used in Baden to make a spirit called &quot;&quot;Topinambur-Branntwein&quot; (Jerusalem artichoke brandy), &quot;Topinambur&quot; (Jerusalem artichoke), &quot;Topi&quot;, &quot;Erdäpfler&quot;, &quot;Rossler&quot;, or &quot;Borbel&quot;&quot;. &quot;Topinambur&quot; produced in the European Union and Switzerland must be made exclusively from Jerusalem artichokes, contain at least 38% alcohol by volume, and contain neither added alcohol nor flavorings. Caramel color is the only permitted additive.

Jerusalem artichoke brandy smells fruity and has a slight nutty-sweet flavor. An intense, pleasant, earthy note characterizes it. The tubers are washed and dried in an oven before being fermented and distilled. It can be further refined to make &quot;Red Rossler&quot; by adding the roots of the common tormentil, giving it a bitter and astringent taste and a red color. Red Rossler contains other ingredients such as currants, producing a schnapps with about 50% alcohol used as digestif and as a folk remedy for diarrhea or abdominal pain.

===US marketing scheme===
In the 1980s, the Jerusalem artichoke also gained some notoriety when its seeds were planted by Midwestern US farmers at the prodding of an agricultural attempt to save the family farm. This effort aimed to teach independent farmers to raise their own food, feed, and fuel. Little market existed for the tuber in that part of the US then, but contacts were made with sugar producers, oil and gas companies, and the fresh food market for markets to be developed. Fructose had not yet been established as a mainstay, nor was ethanol used as a main fuel additive as it is today. The only real profit in this effort was realized by a few first-year growers (who sold some of their seed to other farmers individually as well as with the help of the company attempting this venture). As a result, many of the farmers who had planted large quantities of the crop lost money.

== Diseases and pests ==
Stem rot disease is caused by the fungus &quot;Agroathelia rolfsii&quot; (aka &quot;Sclerotium rolfsii&quot; or &quot;Athelia rolfsii&quot;), which is one of the most important pathogens causing tuber and stem rot and up to 60% loss in Jerusalem artichoke yield. Growing resistant varieties is an important method of controlling &quot;Agroathelia rolfsii&quot;.

==Cultivation and uses==
Some species are grown as flavouring agents or for their medicinal properties. The most notable of these is garden angelica (&quot;A. archangelica&quot;), which is commonly known simply as &quot;angelica&quot;. Crystallized strips of young angelica stems and midribs are green in colour and are sold as decorative and flavoursome cake decoration material, but may also be enjoyed on their own. The roots and seeds are commonly used to flavour gin. Its presence accounts for the distinct flavour of many liqueurs, such as Chartreuse.

Seacoast angelica (&quot;A. lucida&quot;) has been eaten as a wild version of celery.

&quot;A. sylvestris&quot; and some other species are eaten by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including bordered pug, grey pug, lime-speck pug and the V-pug.

===Asia===
The radix of Angelica dahurica is widely used as an herbal remedy in traditional Chinese medicine and is known as . In Korean medicine, its name is &quot;baek-ji&quot;.

In parts of Japan, especially the Izu Islands, the shoots and leaves of &quot;ashitaba&quot; (&quot;A. keiskei&quot;) are eaten as tempura, particularly in the spring.

===Europe===
Natives of Lapland use the fleshy roots as food and the stalks as medicine. Among the Sami people of Lapland, the plant is used to make a traditional musical instrument the &quot;fadno&quot;.

===North America===
&quot;A. dawsonii&quot; was used by several first nations in North America for ritual purposes.

&quot;A. atropurpurea&quot; is found in North America from Newfoundland west to Wisconsin and south to Maryland, and was smoked by Missouri tribes for colds and respiratory ailments. This species is very similar in appearance to the poisonous water hemlock.

The boiled roots of angelica were applied internally and externally to wounds by the Aleut people in Alaska to speed healing.

<text>Masaba (&quot;Lumasaaba&quot;), sometimes known as Gisu (&quot;Lugisu&quot;) after one of its dialects, is a Bantu language spoken by more than two million people in East Africa. The Gisu dialect in eastern Uganda is mutually intelligible with Bukusu, spoken by ethnic Luhya in western Kenya. &quot;Masaba&quot; is the local name of Mount Elgon and the name of the son of the ancestor of the Gisu tribe. Like other Bantu languages, Lumasaba nouns are divided into several sets of noun classes. These are similar to the genders in Germanic and Romance languages, except that instead of the usual two or three, there are around eighteen different noun classes. The language has a quite complex verb morphology.

==Varieties==
Varieties of Masaba are as follows:
*Gisu (&quot;Lugisu&quot;)
*Kisu
*Bukusu (&quot;Lubukusu&quot;; ethnic Luhya)
*Syan
*Tachoni (&quot;Lutachoni&quot;; ethnic Luhya)
*Dadiri (&quot;Ludadiri&quot;)
*Buya (&quot;Lubuya&quot;)

Dadiri is spoken in the north, Gisu in the center, and Buya in the center and south of Masaba territory in Uganda. Bukusu is spoken in Kenya, separated from ethnic Masaba by Nilotic languages on the border.

==Phonology==
See Bukusu dialect for details of one variety of Masaba.

===Consonants===

* Sounds /k, ɡ, ŋ/ when before front vowels /i, e/ are heard as palatal [c, ɟ, ɲ].

* Sounds /i, u/ may be heard as glides [w, j] within initial vowel sequences.

===Vowels===
Masaba has a basic 5-vowel system consisting of /i, e, a, o, u/.

<text>Earl of Granard is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1684 for Arthur Forbes, 1st Viscount Granard. He was a lieutenant-general in the army and served as Marshal of the Army in Ireland after the Restoration and was later Lord Justice of Ireland. He had already succeeded his father as second Baronet of Castle Forbes and been created Baron Clanehugh and Viscount Granard in 1675, also in the Peerage of Ireland. The baronetcy, of Castle Forbes in county Longford, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 29 September 1628 for his father, Arthur Forbes.

The first Earl&#x27;s grandson, the third Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He was summoned to the Irish House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as &quot;Lord Forbes&quot; in his father&#x27;s lifetime. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He was a lieutenant-general in the Army. His grandson, the sixth Earl, was a general in the Army. In 1806 he was created Baron Granard, of Castle Donington in the County of Leicester, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the Earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the seventh Earl. He notably served as Lord Lieutenant of County Leitrim from 1856 to 1872. His son, the eighth Earl, was a soldier and Liberal politician. Lord Granard held junior office in the Liberal administrations of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith and was also a member of the Senate of Southern Ireland and of the Senate of the Irish Free State. the titles are held by his grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his uncle in 1992.

The invented title of &quot;Viscount Forbes&quot; is used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s heir apparent.

The family seat is Castle Forbes, near Newtownforbes, County Longford.

<doc id="462585" wikidata="Q5326281" url="?curid=462585" title="Earl of Gosford">
<text>Earl of Gosford is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1806 for Arthur Acheson, 2nd Viscount Gosford.

The Acheson family descends from the Scottish statesman Sir Archibald Acheson, 1st Baronet of Edinburgh, who later settled in Markethill, County Armagh. He served as Solicitor General for Scotland, as a Senator of Justice (with the title Lord Glencairn), as an Extraordinary Lord of Session as &#x27;Lord Glencairn&#x27;, and as Secretary of State for Scotland. In 1628 he was created a baronet in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage, the 2nd Baronet. He married but died without male issue at a relatively early age and was succeeded by his half-brother, George, the 3rd Baronet, who settled in Ireland and was High Sheriff for cos. Armagh and Tyrone.

His son, the 4th Baronet, represented County Armagh in the Irish House of Commons. On his death the title passed to his son, the fifth Baronet. He sat as Member of the Irish Parliament for Mullingar. His son, the sixth Baronet, represented Dublin University and Enniskillen in the Irish House of Commons. In 1776 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Gosford, of Market Hill in the County of Armagh, and in 1785 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Gosford, of Market Hill in the County of Armagh, also in the Peerage of Ireland.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Viscount. He sat in the Irish Parliament as the representative for Old Leighlin from 1783 to 1790. In 1806 he was created Earl of Gosford in the Peerage of Ireland. Since then, heirs apparent to the earldom have traditionally used the invented courtesy title of Viscount Acheson. His son, the second Earl, sat on the Whig benches in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1811 to 1849 and served under Lord Melbourne as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard in 1834 and 1835. Between 1835 and 1838 he was Governor General of British North America. Lord Gosford married Mary, daughter of Robert Sparrow of Worlingham Hall in Suffolk. In 1835 he was created Baron Worlingham, of Beccles in the County of Suffolk, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords.


He was succeeded by his son, the third Earl. He represented County Armagh in the House of Commons from 1831 to 1847. The latter year, two years before he succeeded his father in the earldom, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Acheson, of Clancairny in the County of Armagh. His son, the fourth Earl, served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Armagh and was also a Lord of the Bedchamber to the Prince of Wales and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household to Her Majesty Queen Alexandra. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He was a colonel in the Coldstream Guards and fought in the Second Boer War and in the First World War. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, sat on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords and served under Harold Macmillan as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1958 to 1959. the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1966.

The family seat was Gosford Castle, near Markethill, County Armagh.

<text>James Joseph Tarbuck (born 6 February 1940) is an English comedian, singer, actor, entertainer and game show host.

Tarbuck was a host of &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; in the mid-1960s and hosted numerous game shows and quiz shows on ITV during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. He is also known for leading ITV&#x27;s &quot;Live from Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot; and its subsequent incarnations during the 1980s.

Actress, television and radio presenter Liza Tarbuck is his daughter.

==Biography==
Tarbuck was born in Wavertree, Liverpool, on 6 February 1940, son of bookmaker Joseph Frederick Tarbuck and Ada McLoughlin. Joseph Tarbuck had been at school with Ted Ray. Jimmy had a brother, Kenneth, and a sister, Norma (another elder brother died aged 18 months), and was a friend of Dave Morris. He attended Dovedale Primary School in Liverpool, where he was a schoolmate of John Lennon.

From October 1955 to late 1956 Tarbuck played washboard in a band known as the Blackjacks. Later in April 1960, at the age of 20, he was convicted of stealing a diamond-encrusted cigarette holder from the dressing room of comedian Terry-Thomas, and was placed on probation for two years. For a period, he worked in a ladies&#x27; hairdresser with Mike McCartney (brother of Paul) and Lewis Collins.

His first television show was &quot;It&#x27;s Tarbuck &#x27;65!&quot; on ITV in 1964, though he had been introduced on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; in October 1963 by Bruce Forsyth. He then replaced Forsyth as the last original host of the show from 1965 until it was axed in 1967. He has also hosted numerous quiz shows, including &quot;Winner Takes All&quot;, &quot;Full Swing&quot;, and &quot;Tarby&#x27;s Frame Game&quot;. In the early 1970s he hosted a variety show &quot;Tarbuck&#x27;s Luck&quot; on the BBC.

In the 1980s, he hosted similar Sunday night variety shows, &quot;Live from Her Majesty&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Live from the Piccadilly&quot; and finally &quot;Live from the Palladium&quot;, which were produced by London Weekend Television for ITV.

He appeared on the fourth series of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2006, but was forced to pull out due to high blood pressure, and needed surgery to fit stents in his heart. In 2008, he returned to a variety format on television screens when he co-hosted, alongside Emma Bunton, an edition of ITV1&#x27;s variety show &quot;For One Night Only&quot;. He appeared on &quot;Piers Morgan&#x27;s Life Stories&quot; on 25 May 2012, while on 3 December that year he was invited to celebrate 100 years of the Royal Variety Performance along with Bruce Forsyth, Ronnie Corbett and Des O&#x27;Connor.

Tarbuck made a &quot;Comedy Playhouse&quot; pilot for the BBC in 1967, acting in Johnny Speight&#x27;s &quot;To Lucifer, A Son&quot; alongside John Le Mesurier and Pat Coombs, but a series was not commissioned. His only other acting credit was in a 1993 episode of police comedy &quot;The Detectives&quot;, playing the straight role of Johnny McKenna, an international arms dealer who liked to conduct his business on the golf course.

In October 2015, Tarbuck and Des O&#x27;Connor starred in their own one-off show at the London Palladium to raise money for the new Royal Variety Charity. During the following two years they toured clubs and theatres around the UK with his comedy show.

Tarbuck was a close friend of actor and singer Kenny Lynch.

==Personal life==
Tarbuck married Pauline (&quot;née&quot; Carfoot) in 1959. His best man was footballer Bobby Campbell. The couple live in Coombe, Kingston upon Thames, London, and have three children: Cheryl (born in 1960), Liza (born in 1964) and James (born in 1968).

Tarbuck has often been nicknamed &#x27;Tarby&#x27;. He is a Conservative Party supporter and, at the height of his celebrity, was a prominent supporter of Margaret Thatcher.

Tarbuck is well known as a keen player of golf, and was prominent as a competitor in pro-celebrity golf matches when these were televised. He is also a devoted supporter of Liverpool Football Club. 

In February 2020, Tarbuck revealed the day after his 80th birthday that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

On 15 May 2023 Tarbuck committed a series of driving offences, causing damage to vehicles while driving in Coombe Gardens, Kingston upon Thames, near his home. The incident was reported to have occurred a few days after his sister&#x27;s funeral. According to court documents, he pleaded guilty to a series of offences, including driving a mechanically propelled vehicle without due care and attention, failing to stop and give his name and address following a road accident and failing to report an accident.

<doc id="462594" wikidata="Q1416913" url="?curid=462594" title="Stenomask">
<text>A stenomask is a hand-held microphone built into a padded, soundproof enclosure that fits over the speaker&#x27;s mouth or nose and mouth. Some lightweight versions may be fitted with an elastic neck strap to hold them in place while freeing the user&#x27;s hands for other tasks. The purpose of a stenomask is to allow a person to speak without being heard by other people, and to keep background noise away from the microphone.

A stenomask is useful for speech recognition applications, because it allows voice transcription in noisy environments. Perhaps more importantly, a stenomask silences the user&#x27;s voice so that it does not interfere with the surrounding environment such as a court or a classroom. The user can verbally identify the speaker, indicate gestures and unspoken answers, and describe activities as they take place.

An operator of a stenomask can be trained to &quot;re-voice&quot; everything they hear into a stenomask connected to a speech recognition system, for a real-time text transcription of everything spoken. This allows a &quot;voice writer&quot; to produce instant text feeds within a courtroom and distribute them in plain text format immediately after a proceeding. The equipment can also interface with litigation management software.

A trained operator using a stenomask connected to a pre-trained speech recognition system can exceed 180 words per minute while at the same time exceeding 95 percent accuracy. They may also modify the pronunciation of the words they are speaking in order to improve accuracy.

In comparison to conventional approaches like Gregg shorthand and stenotype technology, the main disadvantage of stenomask technology is the distinctive visual appearance of the operator when speaking into the stenomask. As the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; put it, they &quot;can channel their inner Darth Vader.&quot; In covering Wisconsin&#x27;s first official voice writer, the &quot;Racine Journal Times&quot; began by explaining that the mask is not &quot;a way to summon his minions to build the Death Star.&quot;

Microphones that work much like a stenomask are used by aircraft ground crews to communicate with cockpit crews in airport environments with extreme engine noise, and are usually part of their headsets.

==History==
The stenomask was developed by Horace Webb and two colleagues in the early 1940s. He was proficient with Gregg shorthand, but sought a more accurate and faster system of transcription, as shorthand notes can become unmanageable with fast talkers or difficult terminology. Furthermore, until speech recognition software became accurate enough for everyday use in the mid-1990s, shorthand reporters would verbally dictate transcription notes into typewritten form, resulting in about two hours dictation for every hour transcribing.

Thus, Webb thought he could &quot;repeat it with my voice instead of with a pen&quot;. After much experimentation — first with a cigar box and then a tomato juice can — he arrived at a solution using a microphone inside a military aviator&#x27;s rubber oxygen mask, paired with a coffee pot filled with sound-absorbing material. The result was eventually deemed by the United States Navy to be the most accurate method of transcription among &quot;all known systems of verbatim reporting&quot;, and was subsequently adopted for use in their court reporting.

<doc id="462606" wikidata="Q5326306" url="?curid=462606" title="Earl of Kerry">
<text>Baron Kerry is an ancient title in the Peerage of Ireland, named after County Kerry. It was created circa 1223 for Thomas FitzMaurice, Lord OConnello, son of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Llanstephan.

In 1325, Maurice FitzMaurice, 4th Baron Kerry, murdered Diarmaid Óg MacCarthy (son of Cormac Mór MacCarthy) in the courtroom at Tralee. For this act, Maurice was tried and attainted by the parliament in Dublin and his lands forfeited, but after his death they were restored to his brother John FitzMaurice, 5th Baron of Kerry.

The title was sometimes given as Baron Lixnaw (after Lixnaw) or Baron Kerry and Lixnaw. In a 1615 dispute with Baron Slane over precedence, it was claimed the title &quot;Baron Lixnaw&quot; was promoted by the rival Earl of Desmond, who wanted &quot;Baron Kerry&quot; to be a a courtesy title for his heir. The Privy Council of Ireland&#x27;s ruling in the dispute referred to Baron Kerry as both &quot;Lo[rd] of Kierry&quot; and &quot;Baron of Kierry and Licksnawe&quot; .

In 1537, the eleventh Baron was created Baron Odorney and Viscount Kilmaule in the Peerage of Ireland. However, these titles became extinct on his death in 1541 while he was succeeded in the Barony of Kerry by his younger brother.

The twenty-first Baron was created Earl of Kerry in the Peerage of Ireland in 1723. His younger son John Petty Fitzmaurice was created the 1st Earl of Shelbourne in the Peerage of Ireland in 1753 and his son William Petty FitzMaurice, the 2nd Earl of Shelburne, who served as British prime minister from 1782 to 1783, was created Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784. In 1818 the latter&#x27;s son, the third Marquess, succeeded his cousin as 4th Earl of Kerry and 24th Baron Kerry. Earl of Kerry has subsequently been used as a courtesy title by heirs of the Marquess.

<doc id="462609" wikidata="Q5616664" url="?curid=462609" title="Paul Daniels">
<text>Newton Edward Daniels (6 April 1938 - 17 March 2016), known professionally as Paul Daniels, was an English magician and television presenter. He achieved international fame through his television series &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot;, which ran on the BBC from 1979 to 1994.

Daniels was known for his catchphrase &quot;You&#x27;ll like this... not a lot, but you&#x27;ll like it!&quot;, and for his marriage to his assistant, Debbie McGee. He was awarded the &quot;Magician of the Year&quot; Award by the Academy of Magical Arts in 1982, the first magician from outside the United States to receive it. He also won the Golden Rose of Montreux in 1985. He was a Member of the Inner Magic Circle with Gold Star. He has been described as &quot;The Godfather of Magic&quot; and has been repeatedly credited with inspiring many top magicians to start in the profession.

Daniels was outspoken on matters including politics, current affairs, magic, entertainment, and fellow celebrities. Towards the end of his life he also appeared in reality television shows.

== Early life ==
Daniels was born on 6 April 1938 in the South Bank area of Middlesbrough, the son of Handel Newton &quot;Hughie&quot; Daniels and Nancy (&quot;née&quot; Lloyd). He was of Welsh descent. His father was a cinema projectionist at the Hippodrome Theatre and a worker for ICI in Wilton, North Riding of Yorkshire. After completing his education at Sir William Turners Grammar School on Coatham Road in Coatham, North Riding of Yorkshire and holding his first job as a junior clerk in the treasurer&#x27;s office of Eston Council, Daniels served as a conscript in the 1st Battalion, Green Howards, during his national service. He was posted to the British garrison in Hong Kong before training as an accountant in local government.

Even in his early age, Daniels had thinning hair, which he claimed to be an act of &quot;magic&quot;. He later sported a wig for much of his television career. After working as a junior clerk and then as an auditor in local government, he joined his parents in their grocery business. He later set up his own shop, at one point a mobile shop, but eventually gave this up in favour of his growing career as a magician.

In 2012, Daniels explained the origin of his stage name to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, saying: &quot;I borrowed the name Paul from my first son, who was born in 1960. I was born Newton Edward Daniels, everyone called me Ted, but Paul worked better for showbusiness&quot;.

== Showbusiness career ==
Daniels&#x27; interest in magic began at the age of 11 when, during a holiday, he read a book called &quot;How to Entertain at Parties&quot;. He began performing magic as a hobby, occasionally entertaining at parties and youth clubs and later doing shows for fellow servicemen during his national service. After returning to civilian life he continued to develop his magic by performing in clubs in the evenings while working at his grocery business during the day. Paul was a member of the Middlesbrough Circle of Magicians where he developed an act. with his first wife Jackie. under the name of &quot;The Eldani&#x27;s&quot;, an anagram of Daniels. It was while working the clubs that he developed what would become his long-running catchphrase, &quot;You&#x27;ll like this ... not a lot, but you&#x27;ll like it.&quot; He stated that he first came up with the line at a club in Bradford as a way to deal with a heckler.

A major turning point in Daniels&#x27; career came in 1969 when he was offered a summer season in Newquay in Cornwall. He decided to sell his grocery business and try magic as a full-time career. He made his television debut on the long-running talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; in 1970, and came second. Television producer Johnnie Hamp saw Daniels in that show and later gave him a regular spot on a show compèred by Bernard Manning, &quot;The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club&quot;, for Granada Television.

In 1978, ITV gave Daniels his own Sunday night show, &quot;Paul Daniels&#x27; Blackpool Bonanza&quot;. His first series for the BBC was &quot;For My Next Trick&quot;, where Daniels appeared with several other magicians and singer Faith Brown. This led to Daniels presenting his own television series, &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot;, on BBC1 from 1979 until 1994. As well as featuring tricks and illusions for pure entertainment, he also included a regular segment (the &quot;Bunco Booth&quot;) in which he exposed the confidence tricks of street charlatans. He also replicated the kind of results that have impressed researchers of the paranormal and parapsychologists in a segment called &quot;Under Laboratory Conditions&quot;, thereby demonstrating his scepticism about claims made in these fields.
Daniels starred in his own stage show, &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot;, at the Prince of Wales Theatre from 10 December 1980 until 6 February 1982. At that time, the show was one of the longest-running magic shows ever staged in London. By this point he was already working with his future wife, Debbie McGee, whose role as his assistant would become a major feature of his act. She had first worked with him on his summer season show in Great Yarmouth in 1979.

In addition to his magic shows he hosted other television series during the 1980s and 1990s, including three BBC1 quiz shows: &quot;Odd One Out&quot;, &quot;Every Second Counts&quot; and &quot;Wipeout&quot; (all of which were based on short-lived American game shows), and the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Wizbit&quot; (also for the BBC), about a magician called Wizbit and a rabbit called Woolly, who lived in Puzzleopolis. In 1987, he was a timekeeper in the charity television special &quot;The Grand Knockout Tournament&quot;.

Also in 1987, Daniels hosted a controversial Halloween live special of his magic show where he replicated a Harry Houdini escape from an iron maiden. The trick was deliberately staged to give the illusion that the escape had gone tragically wrong and Daniels had been killed – it was later broadcast that he had successfully escaped from the device.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1988 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.

Daniels and McGee were the focus of one of the episodes of the 2001 BBC documentary series &quot;When Louis Met...&quot;, presented by Louis Theroux, with Daniels additionally appearing on &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; in an Ali G costume, and was interviewed by Caroline Aherne in her guise as Mrs Merton. In 2004, Daniels and McGee appeared in the Channel 5 reality TV show, &quot;The Farm&quot;, and in 2006, they appeared in the ITV show &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot;. They were the first act voted off the show, after singing &quot;Let Me Entertain You&quot; by Robbie Williams. Daniels and McGee also made a guest appearance in the &quot;Wife Swap&quot; series in early 2007, with McGee changing places with journalist and presenter Vanessa Feltz.

In 2010, he competed in &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; with his partner Ola Jordan. They were consistently criticised by the judges and were the second couple to leave the competition.

In August 2011, while filming a scene for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Sooty&quot;, Daniels was struck by a flying pizza, thrown by the puppet Sooty. He got a piece of pizza in his eye and called in to a cottage hospital for them to rinse it out. Later that month he appeared with his son, Martin, on episode 9 of the first season of &quot;Penn &amp; Teller: Fool Us&quot;.

On 10 October 2012, Daniels and McGee appeared on &quot;All Star Mr &amp; Mrs&quot; on ITV.

In 2008 and 2010, Daniels toured with &#x27;The Best of British Variety Tour&#x27;, with acts including Cannon and Ball, Christopher Biggins, Frank Carson and The Krankies, where he closed the first half of the show.

In 2013, Daniels and Debbie McGee toured their &#x27;First Farewell Tour&#x27;, followed by a tour &#x27;comically&#x27; entitled &#x27;Back Despite Popular Demand Tour&#x27; a year later. They toured &#x27;The Intimate Tour&#x27; in 2015 and starred in the pantomime &quot;Aladdin&quot; at the Regent Theatre, Ipswich from December 2015 until January 2016, completing the run a few days before Daniels was taken ill.

== Awards ==
Daniels was awarded the &quot;Zina Bennett Trophy&quot; from the British Ring of the International Brotherhood of Magicians in 1964 while he was known as &quot;Ted Daniels&quot;.

Daniels was awarded the &#x27;Magician of the Year&#x27; Award by the Academy of Magical Arts in 1982, becoming the first magician from outside the US to receive it. An Easter special of &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot; won the Golden Rose of Montreux Award at the International TV Festival in Switzerland in 1985.

Daniels was the recipient of &#x27;The Maskelyne&#x27;, awarded for services to British Magic by The Magic Circle in 1988.

Daniels was awarded &#x27;The Devant&#x27; for services to International Magic by The Magic Circle in 2007, and &#x27;The Carlton Comedy Award&#x27; was bestowed upon him in 2012 by the same organization.

Daniels was also awarded the &quot;Great Lafayette Award&quot; by the Edinburgh International Magic Festival in 2011.

== Politics and other views ==
Daniels was a supporter of the Conservative Party. He was reported to have considered leaving the UK with the election of a Labour Party government at the 1997 general election. Daniels later said that his views had been misrepresented, and he would only have considered leaving if they raised income tax. Daniels stated that he had limited sympathy with the homeless because he had come from a &quot;very poor&quot; background and &quot;grafted&quot; to achieve his success. In 2011, he tweeted that he did not consider the term &quot;Paki&quot; to be any more offensive than the word &quot;Brit&quot;, and described those who held the opposite view of being excessively politically correct. Daniels was personally affected by the winter storms of 2013–2014 and described himself in an interview for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; as a climate change sceptic, instead attributing flooding to changes in procedures of The Environment Agency, particularly with regard to dredging. He supported the hereditary system in the House of Lords, expressing the view that the aristocracy had &quot;genetic knowledge&quot; that others lacked. On the subject of criminal justice, he once publicly offered to help murderer Ian Huntley end his own life.

Daniels refused to attend magic conferences in the UK since they &quot;...were ruined for me by bitchiness and jealousy...now I only go to foreign conventions where, to be honest, I am greeted with respect and civility AND I have tons of &#x27;foreign&#x27; magician friends.&quot; He was dismissive of modern illusionists, once describing David Blaine as &quot;not very original&quot;. He commented on other television personalities such as Anne Robinson and Chris Morris, saying that Robinson had hated him ever since his 1987 Halloween special hoax performance, while describing Morris as &quot;just nasty.&quot; He was dismissive of the younger generation of impressionists, saying: &quot;Forget Alistair McGowan. There&#x27;s been no-one good since Mike Yarwood.&quot; Daniels was also critical of journalists, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t really understand why journalism has to be so nasty, so sarcastic and intrusive&quot;.

Following the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal in 2012, Daniels said that while he believed his fellow BBC broadcaster Jimmy Savile was &quot;undoubtedly a bad guy&quot;, he questioned whether some accusers were &quot;for real&quot;. His comments were criticised by the NSPCC, and Mark Williams-Thomas, the former child protection officer who had presented the documentary that first aired the allegations against Savile, accused Daniels of &quot;belittling&quot; Savile&#x27;s victims in one of his blog posts. The entry was later removed from Daniels&#x27;s blog.

Daniels was an atheist.

== Personal life ==
Daniels married his first wife, Jacqueline Skipworth (born 1942), in 1960; she was 17 and he was 21. They had three sons together: Gary, Paul, and magician Martin. All three sons occasionally appeared on &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot; in varying capacities. Daniels&#x27;s father often made props for the show, such as wooden boxes for the Selbit Sawing illusion, whilst his mother sewed the stage curtains for his theatre tours.

Daniels married his second wife, long-time assistant Debbie McGee, on 2 April 1988 in Buckinghamshire. The couple met in London in May 1979 during rehearsals for Daniels&#x27;s summer season show in Great Yarmouth that year. McGee went on to work with Daniels in his 1980 summer show in Bournemouth and then his London stage show &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot; before being offered the role of assistant in his long-running television series. Their relationship gradually became more established, and he proposed in 1987. When they married, he was 50 and she was 29. Early in their marriage, they lived in a house in Denham that once belonged to Roger Moore. In 1998, they moved to a house on the banks of the River Thames in Wargrave, Berkshire.

Daniels&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Under No Illusion&quot;, includes descriptions of his and McGee&#x27;s joking life: &quot;I was writing and needed to concentrate, so I had a &#x27;Do Not Disturb&#x27; sign on my back. Eventually I went to bed and Debbie was lying stark naked on the bed – eat your heart out fellas! She was wearing the sort of sleeping blindfold you get on long-haul flights. Printed on it was &#x27;Do Not Disturb&#x27;. But further down her body she had a sign that said &#x27;Disturb&#x27;!&quot;

Daniels also wrote in the book that he had, as of 2000, sexual relations with more than 300 women. He said that he had a &quot;passionate&quot; encounter with a schoolgirl hitch-hiker in 1969 when he was aged 30, though he ejected her from the car upon realising her age.

Daniels maintained a website that included personal information, a detailed blog, and podcasts.

In 2012, Daniels cut off his left index finger and the tip of his ring finger in an accident with a circular saw, in the garden shed of his Wargrave home. He drove himself from his home to hospital in Henley-on-Thames, where the index finger was reattached.

==Health problems and death==
On 20 February 2016, Daniels had a fall and was taken to hospital, where he was treated by medical staff for suspected pernicious anemia. It was later discovered that he had an incurable brain tumour. He died less than a month later, on 17 March, at the age of 77, at his home in Wargrave.

<text>Timex Social Club is an American R&amp;B group, formed in 1985 and best known for the 1986 hit single &quot;Rumors&quot;.

==History==
Originally known as the Timex Crew, members included Marcus Thompson (founder), Gregory &quot;Greg B&quot; Thomas, Michael Marshall, Craig Samuel, and Darrien Cleage. By 1986, Samuel, Cleage, and Thomas had departed, Alex Hill and Kevin Moore were added, and the name Timex Social Club was adopted (despite the group&#x27;s name, Timex Group USA bears no sponsorship of the group). They fused funk and urban R&amp;B. 

In 1986, the group released the &quot;Vicious Rumors&quot; album produced by Jay Logan on Danya/Fantasy Records (A&amp;M in Canada; Mercury in Europe; CBS/Sony in Japan). Its one major hit, &quot;Rumors&quot;, written by Thompson, Hill, and Marshall, peaked at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 13 in the UK, and number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B, Hot Dance Club Play, and Hot Dance/Disco-12 inch Singles-Sales charts. The two follow-up singles, &quot;Thinkin&#x27; About Ya&quot; and &quot;Mixed-Up World&quot;, reached the R&amp;B top 20. Also in 1986 Ocea Savage was added on keyboards and background vocals.

===Tour===
The success of the single &quot;Rumors&quot; prompted hip hop impresario Russell Simmons to hire the group as the opening act for 38 dates on Run DMC&#x27;s Raising Hell tour in 1986. Other acts on the tour were Beastie Boys, LL Cool J, and Whodini. Besides solo dates, the group also opened for New Edition, Midnight Star, the S.O.S. Band, Kool &amp; the Gang, and Jermaine Jackson.

===Split===
Timex Social Club disbanded shortly after the success of &quot;Rumors&quot;. The band&#x27;s producer Jay King, Denzil Foster, and Thomas McElroy formed Club Nouveau, whose first single was &quot;Jealousy&quot;, an answer song to &quot;Rumors&quot; that references Timex Social Club&#x27;s split. Club Nouveau subsequently had a #1 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit in 1987 with a go-go cover of Bill Withers&#x27;s &quot;Lean on Me&quot;.

===Revival===
As of 2011, the current Timex Social Club roster consisted of founding member Marcus Thompson as DJ and Samuelle Prater on vocals.

<doc id="462612" wikidata="Q407506" url="?curid=462612" title="Bromothymol blue">
<text>Bromothymol blue (also known as bromothymol sulfone phthalein and BTB) is a pH indicator. It is mostly used in applications that require measuring substances that would have a relatively neutral pH (near 7). A common use is for measuring the presence of carbonic acid in a liquid. It is typically sold in solid form as the sodium salt of the acid indicator.

==Structure and properties==

Bromothymol blue acts as a weak acid in a solution. It can thus be in protonated or deprotonated form, appearing yellow or blue, respectively. It is bright aquamarine by itself, and greenish-blue in a neutral solution. The deprotonation of the neutral form results in a highly conjugated structure, accounting for the difference in color. An intermediate of the deprotonation mechanism is responsible for the greenish color in neutral solution.

The protonated form of bromothymol blue has its peak absorption at 427 nm thus transmitting yellow light in acidic solutions, while the deprotonated form has its peak absorption at 602 nm thus transmitting blue light in more basic solutions. In contrast, highly acidic bromothymol blue is magenta in color.

The general carbon skeleton of bromothymol blue is common to many indicators including chlorophenol red, thymol blue, and bromocresol green.

The presence of one moderate electron-withdrawing group (bromine atom) and two moderate donating groups (alkyl substituents) are responsible for bromothymol blue&#x27;s active indication range from a pH of 6.0 to 7.6. While the conjugation is responsible for the length and nature of the color change range, these substituent groups are ultimately responsible for the indicator&#x27;s active range.
Bromothymol blue is sparingly soluble in oil, but soluble in water, ether, and aqueous solutions of alkalis. It is less soluble in nonpolar solvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, and practically insoluble in petroleum ether.

==Synthesis and preparation==
Bromothymol blue is synthesized by addition of elemental bromine to thymol blue in a solution in glacial acetic acid.

To prepare a solution for use as pH indicator, dissolve 0.10 g in 8.0 cm3 N/50 (a.k.a. 0.02 Normal) NaOH and dilute with water to 250 cm3. To prepare a solution for use as indicator in volumetric work, dissolve 0.1 g in 100 cm3 of 50% (v/v) ethanol.

==Uses==
Bromothymol blue may be used for observing photosynthetic activities, or as a respiratory indicator (turns yellow as CO2 is added). A common demonstration of BTB&#x27;s pH indicator properties involves exhaling through a tube into a neutral solution of BTB. As CO2 is absorbed from the breath into the solution, carbonic acid forms and change the solution color from green to yellow. Thus, BTB is commonly used in science classes to demonstrate that the more that muscles are used, the greater the CO2 output.

Bromothymol blue has been used in conjunction with phenol red to monitor the fungal asparaginase enzyme activity with phenol red turning pink and bromothymol blue turning blue signalling an increase in pH and therefore enzyme activity. However, a recent study suggests that methyl red is more useful in determining activity due to the bright yellow ring formed in the zone of enzyme activity.

It may also be used in the laboratory as a biological slide stain. At this point, the bromothymol is already blue, and a few drops of BTB are used on a water slide. The specimen is mixed with blue BTB solution and fixed to a slide by a cover slip. It is sometimes used to determine cell walls or nuclei under the microscope.

Bromothymol is used in obstetrics for detecting premature rupture of membranes. Amniotic fluid typically has a pH &gt; 7.2, bromothymol will therefore turn blue when brought in contact with fluid leaking from the amnion. As vaginal pH normally is acidic, the blue color indicates the presence of amniotic fluid. The test may be false-positive in the presence of other alkaline substances such as blood or semen, or in the presence of bacterial vaginosis.

<doc id="462616" wikidata="Q6679483" url="?curid=462616" title="Lord Kinloss">
<text>Lord Kinloss is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1602 for Edward Bruce, later Master of the Rolls, with remainder to his heirs and assigns whatsoever. In 1604 he was also made Lord Bruce of Kinloss, with remainder to his heirs male, and in 1608 Lord Bruce of Kinloss, with remainder to any of his heirs. He was succeeded by his son, the second Lord, who was killed in a duel in 1613.

His younger brother, the third Lord, was created Earl of Elgin and Lord Bruce of Kinloss (a third separate barony) in 1633, with remainder to heirs male whatsoever, bearing the name and arms of Bruce. In 1641 he was also created Baron Bruce (designated &quot;of Whorlton in the County of York&quot;) in the Peerage of England. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was created Baron Bruce of Skelton, Viscount Bruce and Earl of Ailesbury in the Peerage of England in 1664.

His grandson, the fourth Earl of Elgin, was the last male descendant of the first Lord Kinloss and had no male heirs of his own. He therefore chose as his heir his nephew the Hon. Thomas Brudenell, fourth son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan. In 1746 he was given the additional title of Baron Bruce (designated &quot;of Tottenham in the County of Wilts&quot;) with remainder to the Hon. Thomas. On his death in 1747 the earldom of Ailesbury, viscountcy of Bruce, Whorlton barony Bruce, and barony of Bruce of Skelton became extinct. The rest of his titles took three different lines of descent. He was succeeded in the &quot;three&quot; lordships of Bruce of Kinloss and the earldom of Elgin by his kinsman the ninth Earl of Kincardine (see Earl of Elgin and Earl of Kincardine for later history of these peerages). The Tottenham barony of Bruce passed according to the special remainder to his nephew Thomas, the second Baron. (The Earldom of Ailesbury was created anew for Thomas; see the Marquess of Ailesbury for later history of these titles).

The status of the lordship of Kinloss became uncertain. However, in 1868 the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords decided that the rightful heir to the title was James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos, as the son of Lady Mary Bruce, daughter of the fourth Earl of Elgin. However, he never assumed the title. On the death of the Duke, the dukedom became extinct.

The heir to the lordship of Kinloss was his only child, Anne, Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos and &quot;de jure&quot; eighth Lady Kinloss, the wife of Richard Temple-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. In 1868 her grandson, Richard Temple-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, established his right to the lordship before the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords, and became the tenth Lord Kinloss. On his death in 1889 the dukedom became extinct, while the lordship passed to his eldest daughter Mary. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s great-granddaughter, the thirteenth Lady, who succeeded her mother in 2012.

The family seat is North View House, near Sheriff Hutton, North Yorkshire.

<doc id="462620" wikidata="Q5962455" url="?curid=462620" title="Hythe, Hampshire">
<text>Hythe () is a town in Hampshire, England. It is located by the shore of Southampton Water, and has a ferry service connecting it to Southampton. Hythe has a shopping area, a pier, and a marina for yachts.

==History==
The name Hythe means landing-place or haven. Hythe is recorded in a Parliamentary roll from 1293. The Hythe ferry (&quot;Hitheferye&quot;) to Southampton is marked on a map by Christopher Saxton of 1575, and on a map by John Harrison in 1788. Hythe was part of the parish of Fawley, although it became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1841. The current church, of Saint John the Baptist, was erected in 1874. It is of red brick with Bath Stone dressings. The design was by John Oldrid Scott and replaced an earlier church dating from 1823. There were at one time stocks in the village.

The Hampshire Advertiser, 23 Dec 1837, reports the death of John Richards of Hythe (1764-1837) and notes &#x27;the father of the deceased founded the neat little village of Hythe: previous to his time there was no building there of greater pretensions than the huts of a few fishermen. The elder Mr Richards, when he established a shipbuilding yard at Heath (as it was then called) built houses for his workmen and the village soon sprang up.&#x27;

At the beginning of the 20th century, Hythe was a &quot;little fishing village&quot;; with an hourly steamboat service to Southampton, and with the clubhouse of Hythe Yacht Club at the end of the pier. Hythe remained part of the civil parish of Fawley until 1913, when it became part of the parish of Dibden.

Thanks in part to the British Power Boat Company and its excellent access to the English Channel, during World War II Hythe was used as a port for the &quot;little ships&quot; of the Royal Navy, the Motor Torpedo Boats and the RAF Air/Sea Rescue Boats. In 1960, The Hovercraft Development Company and Sir Christopher Cockerell, its founder, moved to Hythe. There was also a small Royal Air Force base in Hythe known as RAF Hythe. Until its closure in September 2006 it was used by the United States Army to service and maintain watercraft. Part of the site is now used by the local Air Training Corps squadron. 

Hythe was a village up to the 1950s, but the expansion of Fawley Refinery led to a demand for more houses for workers, and Hythe and Dibden Purlieu were allowed to expand into a small town. In 1983, following the growth of Hythe, the parish of Dibden was renamed to Hythe and Dibden, to reflect the importance of Hythe as a new focal point of the Parish. Construction of Hythe Marina began in 1985.

==Geography==
Hythe has a small shopping area clustered around the High Street, which includes two supermarkets (a Waitrose and a Lidl), a public library, several charity shops, and small independent shops. The Hythe Pier, Railway and Ferry operates across Southampton Water to Southampton, and is the oldest working pier train in the world.

Hythe&#x27;s position makes it a good vantage point for viewing ocean liners arriving and departing at the port of Southampton, which attracts ship-watchers to the area. Hythe has a marina, at which a large number of yachts and boats are moored. Large and expensive houses are situated around the marina, overlooking the waterside.

Ewart Recreation Ground on Jones Lane in Hythe is home to Hythe and Dibden Cricket Club. The club was formed in 1948 with the amalgamation of The Hythe Club and The Dibden Purlieu Club. The Hythe club was formed in 1860.

Hythe was home to the US Army between 1968 and 2006 at RAF Hythe. Following its closure, RAF Hythe was bought by the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), who turned the site into a marine business park, Hythe Marine Park. Every year, usually around August, the marina hosts the RNLI (Royal National Lifeboat Institution) Great Waterside Raft Race, where teams race rafts in the Solent Estuary to raise money in support of the nearby Calshot RNLI station.

==British Power Boat Company==

The British Power Boat Company, which manufactured racing boats and later military patrol boats, was formed on 30 September 1927 when Hubert Scott-Paine bought and renamed Hythe&#x27;s shipyard, with the intention of transforming it into one of the most modern mass production boat building yards in the country. Together with his chief designer, Fred Cooper, the company produced many racing boats which won numerous awards around Europe, including Miss England II and Miss Britain III.

From 1930 the British Power Boat Company supplied seaplane tenders to the Air Ministry, commencing with RAF200, a -footer. In 1931 the Royal Air Force seconded T. E. Lawrence – better known as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; – in his service name of T. E. Shaw, to liaise with Scott-Paine on the design, trials and operations of the boat. Lawrence lodged in the village from 1931 to 1932, in Myrtle Cottage at the junction of St John Street and Shore Road. The tenders were initially powered by twin 100bhp Meadows petrol engines giving a maximum speed of 29 knots, with some later versions fitted with Perkins S6M diesels.

== Thermionic Products and RACAL Recorders ==
Thermionic Products, acquired by RACAL Electronics plc to become RACAL Recorders, was established in Hythe in the 1950s, moving to a large facility at the nearby Hardley Industrial Estate. RACAL Recorders produced a wide range of specialist magnetic tape recorders for recording multiple channels of voice, as used by air traffic control and the emergency services, and also instrumentation recorders. The company was awarded a number of patents. RACAL Recorders won several Queen&#x27;s Awards for innovation and export.

==Sport and leisure==
Hythe has a non-League football club Hythe &amp; Dibden FC, which plays at Clayfields Sports Ground, as well as Southern Premier League cricket club Hythe &amp; Dibden Cricket Club.

Not far away is Applemore Recreation Centre, near Applemore College, where the New Forest District Council supplies facilities, which include swimming, archery, basketball, tennis, squash and more.

Hythe&#x27;s proximity to Southampton Water makes water sports easily accessible, via Hythe Marina, Hythe Marina&#x27;s slipway or Hythe Sailing Club. The slipway is used for the annual RNLI Raft Race.

Hythe Sea Scouts also have good access to the water – their hut adjacent to Hythe Sailing Club. As a Royal Navy recognised group, the group has acquired a variety of kayaks, canoes and dinghies through funding. The building is currently undergoing maintenance due to erosion of the coastline putting the group at threat of being &#x27;washed away&#x27;. A significant funding campaign, led by Chris Godfrey, raised over £80,000 to secure the ground beneath the scout hut.

<doc id="462621" wikidata="Q7514224" url="?curid=462621" title="Silas Soule">
<text>Silas Stillman Soule ( ; July 26, 1838 – April 23, 1865) was an American abolitionist, a teenage &#x27;conductor&#x27; on the Underground Railroad, military officer, and an early example of what would later be called a whistleblower. As a Kansas Jayhawker, he supported and was a proponent of John Brown&#x27;s movement in the time of strife leading up to the American Civil War.

During the war, Soule joined the Colorado volunteers, and rose to the rank of captain in the Union Army. Soule was in command of 1st Colorado Cavalry, Company D that was present at Sand Creek and the massacre of Native Americans that occurred there on November 29, 1864. He testified at a U.S. military hearing that convened in February 1865 to investigate the event. Soule was murdered two months later in what some believed was retaliation.

==Early life ==
Silas Soule was born into a family of abolitionists in Bath, Maine, descended from Mayflower passenger George Soule He was raised in Maine and Massachusetts. Soule was a &quot;...friendly, intelligent, and good-natured young man, full of practical jokes, [and] tall tales... In 1854, his family became part of the newly formed New England Emigrant Aid Company, an organization whose goal was to help settle the Kansas Territory and bring it into the Union as a free state. His father and brother arrived in the vicinity of modern day Lawrence in November 1854, and became one of the town&#x27;s founding families. The teenage Silas, his mother, and two sisters came the following summer.

Shortly after the family&#x27;s arrival at Coal Creek located a few miles south of Lawrence, Silas&#x27;s father, Amasa, established his household as a stop on the Underground Railroad. At the age of 17, Silas escorted escaped slaves from Missouri north to freedom.

==Strife in Kansas==


During the late 1850s, pro-slavery forces from Missouri and abolitionist forces from Kansas were engaged in open warfare. The conflict was over whether Kansas would be admitted to the Union as a slave or free state. This period was often called &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;. In July 1859, twenty pro-slavery men had crossed into Kansas to look for escaped slaves. They located and ambushed an Underground Railroad party led by Dr. John Doy, a physician in Lawrence, who was escorting 13 former slaves to Iowa. The men from Missouri arrested Dr. Doy and sold the former slaves.

Doy, meanwhile, was tried and convicted of abducting slaves and sentenced to five years in a Missouri penitentiary. Because he was awaiting transfer to the prison at the jailhouse in St. Joseph, Soule and a group of men from Lawrence decided they would free him. Soule went into the jail and convinced the jailkeeper that he had a letter from Doy&#x27;s wife. The note in fact read: &quot;Tonight, at twelve o&#x27;clock.&quot; Later that night they overpowered the jailer and helped Doy escape back to Kansas. Thereafter known as &quot;The Immortal Ten&quot;, when they reached Lawrence they had their photo taken (above left).

Later that year, after John Brown was captured following the raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Soule once again found himself planning a jailbreak. Brown had been tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging, when, in November 1859, Soule visited him and offered to help him escape. Brown told Soule, however, that he had already decided to become a martyr for the abolitionist cause and would willingly allow himself to be hanged, hoping his death would help bring on a war between North and South. This frustrated Soule&#x27;s planned rescue attempt. Nonetheless, pastor and Secret Six member, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, an associate of Soule&#x27;s, put together a rescue attempt of two men who had also been incarcerated along with Brown, Albert Hazlett and Aaron Dwight Stevens. As part of this plan, Soule posed as a drunken Irishman, got himself arrested for brawling, and was put into the Charles Town jail for the night. He managed to convince the jailer into letting him out of his cell for a short while during which he contacted Brown and the two men. Brown, Hazlett, and Stevens all refused to be sprung from the jail, choosing instead to become martyrs for the cause.

After his release from the Charles Town jail, Soule traveled to Boston, where he often met with various abolitionists and befriended the poet Walt Whitman.

==Life in Colorado and the Civil War==
In May 1860, Soule—along with his brother William, and his cousin, Sam Glass—went to the gold fields in Colorado where he dug for gold and worked in a blacksmith shop.

In 1861, after the start of the Civil War, Soule enlisted in Company K; 1st Colorado Infantry, and took part in the New Mexico campaign of 1862, including the key Battle of Glorieta Pass. In November 1864, he was assigned the command of Company D, 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment.

===The Sand Creek Massacre===
On November 29, 1864, at Sand Creek, in what was then the southeastern corner of territorial Colorado, Colonel John Chivington ordered the Third Colorado Cavalry to attack Southern Cheyenne Chief Black Kettle&#x27;s encampment of Southern Cheyenne. 

Before the attack, Soule told other officers “any man who would take part in [such] murders, knowing the circumstances as we did, was a low lived cowardly son of a bitch.” Several lieutenants also objected to Chivington&#x27;s plans. Lt. Joseph Cramer and Soule went directly to Major Scott Anthony, Chivington&#x27;s superior.

As the attack began, Soule reminded his troops that the supposed &quot;enemy&quot; was a peace chief&#x27;s band, and some responded that they &quot;would not fire a shot today&quot;. His company did not follow the orders given to them to enter the creek bed leading to the settlement but moved up and down the banks and observed the slaughter. There was heavy crossfire, and they did not participate in the killings.

After the attack, in Chivington&#x27;s telegram reporting his &quot;victory&quot; he condemned Soule for &quot;saying that he thanked God he killed no Indians, and like expressions, proving himself more in sympathy with the Indians that the whites.&quot;

The U.S. Congress created a congressional committee to investigate the Sand Creek Massacre due to a nationwide outrage of the incident. Soule&#x27;s and others&#x27; verbal and written testimonies about the Sand Creek Massacre led to Chivington&#x27;s resignation; Colorado&#x27;s Second Territorial Governor, John Evans’, dismissal; and the U.S. Congress refusing the U.S. Army&#x27;s repeated requests for a general war against the Plains Indians.

==Personal life and family==
Soule was &quot;...a great favorite with the men of his own military company...&quot; and could express a &quot;...devilish sense of humor...&quot;being able to &quot;...slither under the thickest skin of pro-slavery or Union supporter alike, with his sharp tongue, cynical nature and charming wit ... [being] wise beyond his years and able to separate the wheat from the chaff on matters of politics...&quot;

On April 1, 1865, Soule married Thersa A. &quot;Hersa&quot; Coberly; the marriage lasted just twenty-two days before he was murdered. Following his death, his widow remarried. She and her second husband, Alfred Lea, became the parents of the adventurer, author, and geopolitical strategist Homer Lea.
==Death==
On April 23, 1865, two months after testifying before a U.S. military commission investigating the Sand Creek Massacre, Soule was on duty as provost marshal of the Colorado Territory in Denver, when he went to investigate guns being fired. At around 10:30 p.m., with his pistol out, Soule went around a corner in what is now downtown Denver, and faced Charles Squier. Soule fired the first shot and wounded Squier&#x27;s left arm, but Squier fired a bullet that entered Soule&#x27;s right cheek, mortally wounding him. Soule was dead before help could arrive. Squier dropped his pistol and ran before he could be arrested by the authorities. Soule&#x27;s assassination occurred two weeks after the end of the Civil War.

One of Soule&#x27;s assassins fled the scene, but Squier was eventually caught and brought back to Denver for a court-martial. However, the officer who captured Squier was found dead in a Denver hotel with what was presumed to be a staged drug overdose, and Squier escaped to New York, where his father lived. Once there he held various jobs, and tried to rejoin the Army, but was rejected. Squier then fled to Central America to avoid the law. His legs were crushed in a railroad accident, and he later died from gangrene in 1869. Despite his crime, he was buried in New York with honors.

==Remembrance==
Soule&#x27;s funeral on April 26, 1865, was attended by a large crowd, with military and civil dignitaries. A journalist described the funeral as &quot;the finest ever seen in this country.&quot; In 1867, Soule was posthumously brevetted to the rank of major, in recognition of his meritorious service.

Soule was first buried at Denver City Cemetery (now the location of Cheesman Park). A large memorial stone was erected above his grave. The cemetery later closed and burials were transferred in the early 1890s to Riverside Cemetery in Denver. Soule&#x27;s large memorial stone was not moved with his remains, and he now has a soldier&#x27;s gravestone in the Grand Army of the Republic section of Riverside Cemetery. His widow is buried in a different section at Riverside Cemetery.

From 1998 to 2018 a Spiritual Healing Run/Walk was held in November to honor those killed at Sand Creek. It began at the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site in southeastern Colorado and concluded on the west steps of the Colorado State Capitol. Starting in 2010, a memorial ceremony was also held at Soule&#x27;s grave site and at a Denver high-rise building where a memorial plaque honoring Soule was installed near the location of his murder.

==Legacy==
Soule&#x27;s name has been proposed as a replacement name for several locations in Colorado. Soule was among the proposed names when Mount Evans was renamed Mount Blue Sky. A creek in Chaffee County (whose name previously included an offensive slur) was renamed Silas Soule Creek. In 2022, it was recommended as a new name for Colorado&#x27;s Pingree Park, Pingree Road and Pingree Hill after Colorado State University renamed its nearby campus Colorado State University Mountain Campus.

<text>Madeline Gail Kahn (&quot;née&quot; Wolfson; September 29, 1942 – December 3, 1999) was an American actress, comedian, and singer. She was known for her comedic roles in films directed by Peter Bogdanovich and Mel Brooks, including &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972), &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977), &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot; (1981), and her Academy Award–nominated roles in &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973) and &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974).

Kahn made her Broadway debut in &quot;Leonard Sillman&#x27;s New Faces of 1968&quot;, and received Tony Award nominations for the play &quot;In the Boom Boom Room&quot; in 1974 and for the original production of the musical &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot; in 1978. She starred as Madeline Wayne on the short-lived sitcom &quot;Oh Madeline&quot; (1983–84) and won a Daytime Emmy Award in 1987 for an &quot;ABC Afterschool Special&quot;. She received a third Tony Award nomination for the revival of the play &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; in 1989, before winning the 1993 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for the comedy &quot;The Sisters Rosensweig&quot;. Her other film appearances included &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; (1983), &quot;City Heat&quot; (1984), &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), and &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995).

==Early life and education==

Kahn was born in Boston, the daughter of Bernard B. Wolfson, a garment manufacturer, and his wife Freda (née Goldberg). She was raised in a nonobservant Jewish family. Her parents divorced when Kahn was two, and she moved with her mother to New York City. In 1953, Freda married Hiller Kahn, who later adopted Madeline; Freda eventually changed her own name to Paula Kahn. Madeline Kahn had two half-siblings: Jeffrey (from her mother&#x27;s marriage to Kahn) and Robyn (from her father&#x27;s second marriage).

In 1948, Kahn was sent to the progressive Manumit School, a boarding school in Bristol, Pennsylvania. During that time, her mother pursued her acting dream. Kahn soon began acting herself and performed in a number of school productions. In 1960, she graduated from Martin Van Buren High School in Queens, New York, and then earned a drama scholarship to Hofstra University on Long Island. At Hofstra, she studied drama, music, and speech therapy. Kahn graduated from Hofstra in 1964 with a degree in speech therapy. She was a member of a local sorority on campus, Delta Chi Delta. She later studied singing in New York City with Beverley Peck Johnson.

==Career==
When asked on television by Kitty Carlisle and Charles Nelson Reilly how she began the opera aspect of her career, Kahn said: It&#x27;s so hard to determine exactly when I began or why, singing. The Muse was definitely not in attendance. I&#x27;ll tell you exactly.

To earn money while a college student, Kahn was a singing waitress at a Bavarian restaurant named Bavarian Manor, a &quot;Hofbräuhaus&quot; in New York&#x27;s Hudson Valley. She sang musical comedy numbers during shows.

There was a really important customer there, a big Italian man, who shouted out to me &#x27;Sing &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;&#x27;, and of course he didn&#x27;t mean the whole opera. He meant that one very popular aria, &quot;Un Bel Di&quot;. So, if I was to come back the next summer to earn more money during the next year, I&#x27;d better know that aria. You know, and I didn&#x27;t know anything about it; I just learned that one aria and a few others and then one thing led to another and I studied that, and I discovered that I could sing that, sort of, that way. But my first actual thing that I did was &quot;Candide&quot; for Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 50th birthday at Philharmonic Hall—at the time that&#x27;s what it was called. And I don&#x27;t know if that was an opera, but it was very hard to sing. I actually have done Musetta in &quot;La Bohème&quot; a long time ago in Washington, DC. I mean, utterly terrifying. I mean, basically I feel as though I was asked to do it and I did it.

===1960s===
Kahn began auditioning for professional acting roles shortly after her graduation from Hofstra; on the side, she briefly taught public school. Just before adopting the professional name Madeline Kahn (Kahn was her stepfather&#x27;s surname), she made her stage debut as a chorus girl in a revival of &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;, which led her to join Actors&#x27; Equity. Her part in the musical &quot;How Now, Dow Jones&quot; was written out before the 1967 show reached Broadway.

In 1968, Kahn performed her first professional lead in a special concert performance of the operetta &quot;Candide&quot; in honor of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 50th birthday. She made her Broadway debut in 1968 with &quot;Leonard Sillman&#x27;s New Faces of 1968&quot; and also appeared off-Broadway in the musical &quot;Promenade&quot;.

===1970s and 1980s===
Kahn appeared in two Broadway musicals in the 1970s: a featured role in Richard Rodgers&#x27; 1970 Noah&#x27;s Ark–themed show &quot;Two by Two&quot; (singing a high C) and a lead turn as Lily Garland in 1978&#x27;s &quot;On the Twentieth Century&quot;. She left (or, reportedly, was fired from) the latter show early in its run, yielding the role to understudy Judy Kaye. She starred in a 1977 Town Hall semi-staged concert version of &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (opposite Barry Bostwick and original London cast member Rita Moreno).

Kahn&#x27;s film debut was in the 1968 short &quot;De Düva (The Dove)&quot;. Her feature debut was as Ryan O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s character&#x27;s hysterical fiancée in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s screwball comedy &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972) starring Barbra Streisand. Her film career continued with Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Kahn was cast in the role of Agnes Gooch in the 1974 film &quot;Mame&quot;, but star Lucille Ball fired Kahn due to artistic differences. (Several of Ball&#x27;s biographies say Kahn was eager to be released from the role so that she could join the cast of &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, a film about to go into production. Kahn stated in a 1996 interview with Charlie Rose that she was fired.) Ball&#x27;s version was that Kahn had already been offered &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; and thus deliberately got herself fired by acting badly in the first few days of shooting for &quot;Mame&quot;.

A close succession of comedies—&quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; (1974), and &quot;High Anxiety&quot; (1977)—were all directed by Mel Brooks, who was able to bring out the best of Kahn&#x27;s comic talents. Their last collaboration was 1981&#x27;s &quot;History of the World, Part I&quot;. For &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;, she was again nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In the April 2006 issue of &quot;Premiere&quot;, her performance in &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; as Lili von Shtupp was selected as number 74 on its list of the 100 greatest performances of all time.

In 1975, Kahn again teamed with Bogdanovich to co-star with Burt Reynolds and Cybill Shepherd in the musical &quot;At Long Last Love&quot;. The film was a critical and financial disaster, but Kahn largely escaped blame for the failure. &quot;At Long Last Love&quot; was one of three films in which Kahn worked alongside the character actress Eileen Brennan, the other two being &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; and &quot;Clue&quot;. In that same year, she again teamed with Gene Wilder, this time for his comedy &quot;The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes&#x27; Smarter Brother&quot;. In 1978, Kahn&#x27;s comic screen persona reached another peak with her portrayal of Mrs. Montenegro in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), a spoof of both &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, directed by Robert Moore. That role was followed by a cameo in 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Muppet Movie.&quot;

Kahn&#x27;s roles were primarily comedic rather than dramatic, although the 1970s found her originating roles in two plays that had elements of both: 1973&#x27;s &quot;In the Boom Boom Room&quot; on Broadway and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Marco Polo Sings a Solo&quot; off-Broadway.

After her success in Brooks&#x27; films, Kahn appeared in a number of films in the 1980s. She played Mrs. White in 1985&#x27;s &quot;Clue,&quot; First Lady Constance Link in the 1980 spoof &quot;First Family&quot;, a twin from outer space in the Jerry Lewis sci-fi comedy &quot;Slapstick of Another Kind&quot; (1982), the love interest of Burt Reynolds in the crime comedy &quot;City Heat&quot; (1984), and Draggle in the animated film &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; (1986). She voiced the character Gussie Mausheimer in the animated film &quot;An American Tail&quot;. According to animator Don Bluth, she was cast because he was &quot;hoping she would use a voice similar to the one she used as a character in Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;Blazing Saddles.&quot;

In 1983, Kahn starred in her own short-lived TV sitcom, &quot;Oh Madeline&quot;, which ended after one season due to poor ratings. In 1986, she starred in ABC Comedy Factory&#x27;s pilot of &quot;Chameleon&quot;, which never aired on the fall schedule. In 1987, Kahn won a Daytime Emmy award for her performance in the ABC Afterschool Special &quot;Wanted: The Perfect Guy&quot;.

Kahn returned to the stage as Billie Dawn in the 1989 Broadway revival of &quot;Born Yesterday&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

===1990s===
Kahn played the mother of Molly Ringwald&#x27;s character in the 1990 film &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, and shortly after she recorded a voice for the animated movie &quot;The Magic 7&quot;, which, as of 2024, has still not been released. In 1994, she portrayed suicide hotline worker Blanche Munchnik in the holiday farce &quot;Mixed Nuts&quot;. Kahn played the corrupt mayor in a benefit concert performance of &quot;Anyone Can Whistle&quot; in 1995. She appeared in &quot;Nixon&quot; as Martha Beall Mitchell (1995).

On stage, Kahn played Dr. Gorgeous in Wendy Wasserstein&#x27;s 1993 Broadway play &quot;The Sisters Rosensweig&quot;, a role for which she earned a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She was a member of the cast of &quot;Cosby&quot; (1996–1999) as Pauline, the eccentric friend and neighbor. 

Kahn participated in a workshop reading of &quot;Dear World&quot; at the Roundabout Theatre Company in June 1998, reading the part of Gabrielle. She also voiced Gypsy the moth in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998).

Kahn received good reviews for her turn in the 1999 independent movie &quot;Judy Berlin&quot;, her final film. Before her death, she also voiced Mrs. Shapiro on the first two episodes of &quot;Little Bill&quot;, the second of which (&quot;Just a Baby&quot; / &quot;The Campout&quot;) was dedicated to her memory. Kathy Najimy succeeded her in the role following Kahn&#x27;s death.

==Illness and death==
Kahn was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in September 1998. She underwent treatment, continued to work on &quot;Cosby&quot;, and married John Hansbury in October 1999. However, the disease spread rapidly, and she died on December 3, 1999, at age 57.

She was cremated on December 6, at Garden State Crematory in North Bergen, New Jersey. A bench dedicated to her memory was erected in Central Park by her husband John and her brother Jeffrey. The bench is located near the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir on West 87th Street.

<doc id="462627" wikidata="Q181448" url="?curid=462627" title="Subway Series">
<text>A Subway Series in Major League Baseball (MLB) is one played between teams based in New York City, currently the New York Yankees and New York Mets, and historically the Yankees versus the New York Giants or Brooklyn Dodgers. The venues for games have been accessible via the New York City Subway, hence the name of the series.

The term historically refers to World Series games played between the city&#x27;s teams. The Yankees have appeared in all Subway Series games as they have been the only American League (AL) team based in the city. Since 1997, the term has also been applied to interleague play during the regular season between the Yankees and Mets.

==19th century Subway Series==
Although organized games between all-stars from New York teams against all-stars from Brooklyn teams date back to the 1850s, the first actual New York-Brooklyn &quot;World Championship Series&quot; occurred in 1889, a full nine years before Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York by the Greater New York Act of 1898. At the time, the series would not have been called a &quot;Subway Series&quot;, since New York&#x27;s subway did not open until 1904, but it was the first recorded series involving the teams who would later earn the phrase.

The New York Giants squared off against (and defeated) the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, also called the &quot;Trolley Dodgers&quot;, of the American Association. The following season, Brooklyn withdrew from the Association and joined the League, setting the stage for many future intra-city competitions.

==Early and mid-20th century Subway Series==
By the 1920s, the subway had become an important form of public transport in the city and provided a convenient form of travel between the three city ballparks: the Polo Grounds, in upper Manhattan; Yankee Stadium, in the Bronx; and Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. The 155th Street elevated and subway stations, the 161st Street station, and the Prospect Park respectively, served the ballparks. (New York&#x27;s subway and elevated systems—the IRT, BRT/BMT, and IND—were in competition with each other until 1940.)

In the case of the World Series contests listed, the entire Series could be attended by using the subway. The date of the first usage of the term &quot;Subway Series&quot; is uncertain. The term &quot;Nickel Series&quot; (a nickel was the old subway fare) appeared in newspapers by 1927, and &quot;Subway Series&quot; appeared by 1928. &quot;Subway Series&quot; was clearly already a familiar concept by 1934, as discussed in this article about that year&#x27;s All-Star Game to be held in New York, discussing the &quot;subway series&quot; possibility for the Giants and Yankees. (Ultimately, no New York team made it to the 1934 post-season.).

===Yankees–Giants===

The 1921 and 1922 match-ups were played in a single ballpark, as both the Giants and Yankees then played at the Polo Grounds. The Giants won both of these World Series against the Yankees, the first two Subway Series played. Despite cordial relations just a few years before when the Yankees allowed the Giants to share their home at Hilltop Park for a year in 1911 and the Giants more than returning the favor in kind by sharing Polo Grounds with the Yankees since 1913, the Yankees were issued an eviction notice in mid-1920 ending their lease after the 1922 season. The Yankees opened their new ballpark in 1923. Fortunes changed immediately for the Yankees as they defeated the Giants this time in the third straight year of World Series competition between the two teams. Their new home would host the Yankees&#x27; first of 11 Subway World Series victories that year and first of an unprecedented 37 World Series until the stadium closed in 2008.

The venues for the 1923, 1936, 1937, and 1951 World Series—the Polo Grounds and the old Yankee Stadium—were a short walk apart across the Macombs Dam Bridge over the Harlem River.

===Yankees–Dodgers===

The term was used again in 1941 when the Dodgers made their first World Series appearance since . Multiple Hall of Famers took part in these contests between the &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; and &quot;Dem Bums from Brooklyn&quot; and the games involved numerous achievements including Jackie Robinson breaking the color barrier as the first African-American baseball player in the World Series and Don Larsen&#x27;s performance in pitching the only perfect game in post-season history. The seven matchups between the Yankees and the Dodgers between 1941 and 1956 cemented the term as being mostly associated with the New York vs. Brooklyn contests, during the time when New York City was retroactively dubbed by historians as &quot;The Capital of Baseball&quot;. Despite Brooklyn&#x27;s repeated success at winning the National League pennant, it was only able to win one World Series (1955) against the Yankees, the only time the Dodgers won a championship when in Brooklyn.

==World Series matchups==
All-New York match-ups in World Series play:



==Exhibition series==
In addition to the five World Series played between the Yankees and Giants before 1940, the two teams also played exhibition series against each other from time to time. The match-ups were known as the &quot;City Series&quot; and were sometimes played in October while other teams played in the World Series. However, after 1940, this became difficult because the Yankees would routinely appear in the World Series. In the 17 years from 1941 to 1957 (after which the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California), the Yankees appeared in the World Series 12 times, failing to reach the Series only in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948, and 1954.

The first and only game that featured the Dodgers, Giants, and Yankees was the 1944 Tri-Cornered Baseball Game. The game was a World War II fundraiser, which saw the three teams play in a round-robin format in which each team batted and fielded during six innings and rested for the other three. 

Before New York&#x27;s two National League teams left the city, the Yankees and Giants (from 19461950, 1955) and Yankees and Dodgers (19511954, 1957) played an annual midseason exhibition game called the Mayor&#x27;s Trophy Game to benefit sandlot baseball in New York City. The proceeds raised by the Yankees were given to leagues in Manhattan and the Bronx, while proceeds raised by the Dodgers went to leagues on Long Island and Staten Island. The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season, when the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles and the Giants moved to San Francisco, leaving the Yankees as the only major league team in the city. 

The game was revived in 1963, after the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets in 1962. These games were played primarily to benefit sandlot baseball in the city, with proceeds going to the city&#x27;s Amateur Baseball Federation. After dwindling interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor&#x27;s Trophy Game was discontinued following the 1983 season. It was revived again as a pre-Opening Day series titled the &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Challenge&quot; and held in 1989.
==Modern usage==


In modern usage, the term &quot;Subway Series&quot; generally refers to a series played between the two current New York baseball teams, the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. Their stadiums remain directly accessible by subway: Yankee Stadium via the 161st Street–Yankee Stadium station, and Citi Field via the Mets–Willets Point station.

There are several other New York City-based teams that play each other and are accessible via the city&#x27;s public transport, such as the Knicks and Nets in the NBA, and the Rangers and Islanders in the NHL: the Knicks and Rangers via 34th Street–Penn Station, the Nets via Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center, and the Islanders via Elmont-UBS Arena and Belmont Park on the Long Island Railroad. That being said, the term, &quot;Subway Series&quot; is only generally applied to Major League Baseball.

With the departure of the Dodgers and Giants in the 1950s, New York was left without a crosstown rivalry. Even with the Mets joining MLB they were placed in the National League opposite of the Yankees. When interleague play was introduced in 1997 the teams finally got to play one another in a competitive fashion. The rivalry has included heated moments such as the Roger Clemens and Mike Piazza feud. Currently the Yankees lead the &quot;Subway Series&quot; with the Mets 84–65 all time, as of June 26, 2024.

===Mets–Yankees===
The Mets and Yankees first met in a regular season game on June 16, 1997, with the introduction of interleague play. The Mets won the game 6–0. The Yankees took the next two games to win the series, all three being played at Yankee Stadium. 1999 marked the first year of this rendition of the Subway Series to be two three-game series, three hosted by the Mets and three hosted by the Yankees. The Mets won the series for the first time in 2004, four games to two. The Yankees lead the series all time with 11 series wins to the Mets 3 series wins with there being 10 ties. The Yankees lead in head-to-head wins 75-52, counting postseason.

The first two series in the rivalry were only one three-game series hosted by one team, alternating each year. From 1999 to 2012 the series was changed to two three-game series, with each team hosting three games. This format changed in 2013 to two series of two games hosted by each team, except in years that the AL East and NL east play each year when it goes back to a three-game series.

The Mets and Yankees have played each other in games that live on as classics. The Yankees beat the Mets in the 2000 World Series 4 games to 1. This series included the infamous Mike Piazza and Roger Clemens incident. Clemens, of the Yankees, threw part of a broken bat at Piazza, of the Mets, after a hit. On June 12, 2009 Luis Castillo of the Mets dropped a popup hit by Alex Rodriguez giving the Yankees a win in the series. On May 19, 2006 David Wright, the Mets&#x27; third baseman, had a walkoff hit off Yankees&#x27; star reliever Mariano Rivera to cap off a Mets comeback.

===2000 World Series===

The first Subway Series in New York since 1956 was the 2000 World Series between the New York Yankees and the New York Mets. The Yankees won four games to one and celebrated their 26th championship in front of Mets fans at Shea Stadium.

During the 2000 World Series, the city decorated some of the trains that ran on the train (which went to Shea Stadium in Queens, home of the Mets) and train (which went to the old Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, home of the Yankees). The 7 trains were blue and orange and featured the Mets version of the &quot;NY&quot; logo, and the 4 trains were white with blue pinstripes and featured the Yankees version of the &quot;NY&quot; logo. Also, after each game in the series the city offered free subway rides home for attendees of the game. Yankee fans displayed signs that read &quot;Yankees in 4 and not in 7&quot;, predicting that the Yankees would easily dispatch the Mets in a Series sweep as opposed to a difficult, full-length Series. The signs had the 4 in a dark green circle designating the number 4 train, and the 7 in a purple circle designating the number 7 train.

==Club success==
Note: Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants last season in New York was 1957.&lt;br&gt;Pennants won by all teams include pennants won before the modern World Series.&lt;br&gt;
As of October 30, 2024.

<doc id="462632" wikidata="Q5326305" url="?curid=462632" title="Earl of Kingston">
<text>Earl of Kingston is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1768 for Edward King, 1st Viscount Kingston. The Earl holds the subsidiary titles Baron Kingston, of Rockingham in the County of Roscommon (created in 1764), Viscount Kingston, of Kingsborough in the County of Sligo (created in 1766), Baron Erris, of Boyle in the County of Roscommon (created in 1801), and Viscount Lorton, of Boyle in the County of Roscommon (created in 1806), also in the Peerage of Ireland. He is also a baronet in the Baronetage of Ireland. Between 1821 and 1869 the earls also held the title Baron Kingston, of Mitchelstown in the County of Cork (created in 1821), in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

==Family history until 1755==
The King family descends from Robert King, younger brother of John King, 1st Baron Kingston (a title which became extinct in 1761; see Baron Kingston). In 1682 Robert King was created a baronet, of Boyle Abbey in the County of Roscommon. He subsequently represented County Roscommon and Boyle in the Irish House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, John, the second Baronet, who also represented County Roscommon and Boyle in the Irish Parliament.

John died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the third Baronet, who like his father and brother represented County Roscommon and Boyle in Parliament. Henry was succeeded by his eldest son, Robert, the fourth Baronet, who sat as Member of Parliament for Boyle. In 1748, aged 24, Robert was created Baron Kingsborough in the Peerage of Ireland. He died unmarried only seven years later, at which time the barony became extinct.

==Family history 1755–1869==
Lord Kingsborough was succeeded in the baronetcy by his younger brother, Edward, the fifth Baronet, who represented Boyle and County Sligo in the Irish Parliament. In 1764 Edward was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Kingston, of Rockingham in the County of Roscommon, a revival of the barony held by his kinsmen which had become extinct three years earlier. He was further honoured when he was made Viscount Kingston, of Kingsborough in the County of Sligo, in 1766, and Earl of Kingston in 1768, also in the Peerage of Ireland.

He was succeeded by his son, Robert, the second Earl, who represented County Cork in the Irish House of Commons. He married his kinswoman, the heiress Caroline Fitzgerald (died 1823), daughter of Richard FitzGerald by the Honourable Margaret King, daughter of James King, 4th Baron King (of the first creation). Some detail is known about the lives of the second Earl and his wife, as they hired the pioneer educator and proto-feminist Mary Wollstonecraft as governess to their daughters. Her books &quot;Thoughts on the Education of Daughters&quot; and &quot;Original Stories from Real Life&quot; draw on her experiences under their roof at Mitchelstown Castle. The daughter she influenced the most was Margaret King, who, as Lady Mount Cashell, undertook a Grand Tour on the Continent, accompanied by her friend Catherine Wilmot, whose diaries were eventually published as &quot;An Irish Peer on the Continent, 1801–03&quot; (1920).

The second Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, George, the third Earl, who represented County Roscommon in the Irish Parliament and later sat in the British House of Lords as an Irish representative peer. In 1821 he was created Baron Kingston, of Mitchelstown in the County of Cork, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His eldest son, Edward, Viscount Kingsborough, was an antiquarian and also represented County Cork in the British Parliament.

Lord Kingsborough predeceased his father, unmarried, and the earldom devolved on his younger brother, Robert, the fourth Earl. Robert sat as Member of Parliament for County Cork but was later declared to be of an &quot;unsound mind&quot;. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, James, the fifth Earl, who died childless in 1869, when the barony of Kingston created in 1821 became extinct.

==Family history, 1869–present==
The fifth Earl was succeeded in the remaining titles by his first cousin, Robert King, 2nd Viscount Lorton, who became the sixth Earl. Robert was the son of General the Honourable Robert King, fourth son of the second Earl, who had been created Viscount Lorton in the Peerage of Ireland in 1806 (see Viscount Lorton for earlier history of this branch of the family). Robert, the sixth Earl, had previously represented County Roscommon in Parliament. He died in October 1869, only a month after he succeeded in the earldom.

He was succeeded by his elder son, Robert, the seventh Earl, who died two years later at the age of forty, without any male issue. The seventh Earl was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the eighth Earl, who was Lord-Lieutenant of County Roscommon and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative peer. Henry married Frances Margaret Christina King-Tenison, daughter of Edward King-Tenison, of Kilronan Castle, County Roscommon, and assumed in 1883 by Royal licence the additional surname of Tenison.

He was succeeded by his second but only surviving son, Henry, the ninth Earl, who fought in both the Second Boer War and the First World War and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative peer. As of 2002 the titles are held by the ninth Earl&#x27;s great-grandson, Robert, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded in 2002, the titles having descended from father to son. As of 31 July 2002, the twelfth Earl has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. The baronetcy is considered dormant.

==Other family members==
Several other members of the King family may also be mentioned. The Honourable Sir Henry King, fourth son of the second Earl, was a politician and soldier. The Honourable James William King, younger son of the second Earl, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. George King, son of Reverend the Honourable Richard FitzGerald King, younger son of the second Earl, was a major-general in the British Army.

The Honourable Laurence Harman King-Harman, younger son of the first Viscount Lorton, was the father of Edward King-Harman, a politician (see also Stafford-King-Harman baronets), and Sir Charles King-Harman, High Commissioner to Cyprus.

<text>Earl of Kilmorey () is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1822 for Francis Needham, 12th Viscount Kilmorey, a General in the British Army and former Member of Parliament for Newry. He was made Viscount Newry and Mourne, in the County of Down, at the same time, also in the Peerage of Ireland.

The title of Viscount Kilmorey was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1625 for Sir Robert Needham, Member of Parliament for Shropshire, and High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1606. His son, the second Viscount, represented Newcastle-under-Lyme in Parliament and supported King Charles I during the Civil War. His younger son, the fourth Viscount (who succeeded his elder half-brother), also fought as a Royalist in the Civil War. His great-great-grandson was the twelfth Viscount, who was created Earl of Kilmorey in 1822.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He also represented Newry in the House of Commons. His grandson, the third Earl, (son of Francis Jack Needham, Viscount Newry) was briefly Member of Parliament for Newry and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1881 to 1915.

His eldest son, the fourth Earl, served as Lord Lieutenant of County Down and as Vice-Admiral of Ulster and Commanding Officer of HMS &quot;Caroline&quot;, Ulster Division Royal Naval Reserve. Lord Kilmorey was also an Irish Representative Peer from 1916 to 1961, becoming the last surviving Irish Representative Peer to sit in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Earl. He was the son of Major the Hon. Francis Edward Needham, second son of the third Earl.

 the titles are held by the fifth Earl&#x27;s eldest son, the sixth Earl, who succeeded in 1977. He does not use his titles and did not use his courtesy title of Viscount Newry and Mourne which he was entitled to from 1969 to 1977, and is known as Sir Richard Needham. He is a former Conservative government minister.

The Needham estate, known as Mourne Park, is near Kilkeel in County Down in Northern Ireland but the title and estate were separated when the fifth Earl inherited the title but opted to live in England. The Needham estate or Mourne Park is now owned by the Anley family, descendants of the 4th Earl of Kilmorey. The house was badly damaged by fire on 18 May 2013.

<text>The title chief of staff (or head of staff) identifies the leader of a complex organization such as the armed forces, institution, or body of persons and it also may identify a principal staff officer (PSO), who is the coordinator of the supporting staff or a primary aide-de-camp to an important individual, such as a president, or a senior military officer, or leader of a large organization. 

In general, a chief of staff provides a buffer between a chief executive and that executive&#x27;s direct-reporting team. The chief of staff generally works behind the scenes to solve problems, mediate disputes, and deal with issues before they are brought to the chief executive. Often chiefs of staff act as a confidant and advisor to the chief executive, acting as a sounding board for ideas. Ultimately the actual duties depend on the position and the people involved.

<text>Lord Elibank, of Ettrick Forest in the County of Selkirk, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1643 for Sir Patrick Murray, 1st Baronet, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. He had already been created a Baronet, of Elibank, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1628. 

==History==
The first Lord&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the fifth Lord, was an author and economist. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Lord, who was an admiral in the Royal Navy. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the seventh Lord. He represented Peeblesshire in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Peeblesshire.

His great-grandson, the tenth Lord, was also Lord Lieutenant of Peebleshire. In 1911 he was created Viscount Elibank, of Elibank in the County of Selkirk, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His eldest son and heir apparent, Alexander Murray, Master of Elibank, was a Liberal politician and was created Baron Murray of Elibank in 1912. However, he predeceased his father and the Viscount was succeeded by his younger son, the second Viscount. He sat as Member of Parliament for Glasgow St Rollox and served as Lord Lieutenant of Peeblesshire. On his death the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Viscount. He represented Kincardineshire in Parliament as a Liberal.

However, on his death in 1962 the viscountcy became extinct while he was succeeded in the baronetcy and lordship by his third cousin, the thirteenth Lord. He was the great-grandson of the Hon. James Murray, fourth son of the seventh Lord. He was succeeded his first cousin, the fourteenth Lord. He was the son of Robert Alan Erskine-Murray, uncle of the thirteenth Lord. the titles are held by his son, the fifteenth Lord, who succeeded his father in that year.

The Honourable Alexander Murray of Elibank, fourth son of the fourth Lord, played a significant role in an abortive Jacobite conspiracy, in 1752, thereafter known as the Elibank Plot. He afterwards retired to France, where for some years he was, as &quot;Count Murray&quot;, the representative of the Jacobite claimant &quot;James III and VIII&quot;, known as the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, who created him Earl of Westminster (Letters Patent, August 12, 1759) in the Jacobite Peerage, with remainder to heirs male of the body of his father, the fourth Lord Elibank.

He has produced four &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one singles: &quot;I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)&quot; by Hi-Five, &quot;Stutter&quot; by Joe, &quot;My Prerogative&quot; by Bobby Brown, and &quot;No Diggity&quot; (featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen) by his group, Blackstreet. His other productions include the 1992 singles &quot;Remember the Time&quot; by Michael Jackson and &quot;Right Here (Human Nature Remix)&quot; by SWV. Beginning with his work on the extended play &quot;Teddy Riley, the First Expansion In Asia&quot; (2011), Riley has since worked on releases in the Eastern pop market, having produced the singles &quot;Call Me Baby&quot; for Exo in 2015, &quot;The Boys&quot; for Girls&#x27; Generation in 2011, and &quot;Mamacita&quot; for Super Junior in 2014. 

A two-time Grammy Award winner, Riley is recognized for his influence on the production of contemporary R&amp;B, leading to further usage of samples, sound effects, and rapping segments as well as singing—a practice which in part was reminiscent of the Jackson family. He is also credited with popularizing modern use of the talk box vocoder, and discovering Pharrell Williams in 1991.

==Early life==
Riley was raised in St. Nicholas Houses in Harlem, New York City. A child prodigy from the age of five, he began playing instruments in church. His uncle, who owned the Harlem club The Rooftop, built a studio in the club in which Riley would spend most of his time while growing up. By age 15, he was beginning to work with artists like Doug E. Fresh.

==Career==
Under the guidance of local music producer Gene Griffin, Riley formed the short-lived group Kids at Work. At the age of 18, Riley produced Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s 12&quot; single &quot;Go See the Doctor&quot;. Released on an independent label in 1986, the song became a crossover hit, reaching number 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Riley had previously worked on the production of Doug E. Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew&#x27;s &quot;The Show&quot; in 1985.

In 1987, Riley, Aaron Hall, and Timmy Gatling formed the R&amp;B group Guy. In 1989, Riley produced Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s &quot;I Get the Job Done&quot;, as well as other work for the Jacksons, the Winans, and James Ingram. That same year, he helped produce the debut album &quot;Wrecks-n-Effect&quot; of his rap group, Wreckx-n-Effect.

After the release and tour of Guy&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Future&quot;, Riley co-produced half of Michael Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Dangerous&quot; on the recommendation of Jackson&#x27;s long-time producer Quincy Jones. After the disbandment of Guy in 1992, Riley moved on to producing and promoting Wreckx-n-Effect&#x27;s second album &quot;Hard or Smooth&quot;, which he also performed on.

In late 1991, Riley formed a second group, Blackstreet. The group would go on to release several major hits, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot; (1997), the number one single &quot;No Diggity&quot; (featuring Dr. Dre and Queen Pen) (1996), and &quot;Girlfriend/Boyfriend&quot; (with Janet Jackson featuring Ja Rule and Eve) (1999). By 2011, the group had disbanded and reformed several times.

In 2000, Riley worked with Spice Girl Melanie B on the tracks &quot;ABC 123&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, and &quot;Pack Your Shit&quot; for her solo debut album &quot;Hot&quot;. He also worked on an album with Outsiderz 4 Life, producing &quot;Wil&#x27; Out&quot; and other songs.

At the start of 2006, he was part of the New Jack Reunion Tour, featuring Blackstreet and Guy, in addition to After 7, SWV, and Tony! Toni! Toné!. In May 2006, Riley announced that he would be working on two key projects: a new Blackstreet album and a new Guy album.

In 2008, Riley was the victim of a Ponzi scheme that left him bankrupt. In June 2008, a fire destroyed Riley&#x27;s Virginia Beach recording studio. Fire investigators said that an electrical problem caused the blaze that burned the abandoned recording studio. The Virginia Beach Fire Department said lightning in the area also could have been a factor, although there was no direct
strike. The empty studio was for sale and was insured for $336,000.

In 2009, Riley performed with Guy at the BET Awards. In the same year, Riley worked with Amerie and Robin Thicke on their respective albums. Leading on from his work on Snoop Dogg&#x27;s album &quot;Ego Trippin&#x27;&quot;, Riley became part of the production supergroup QDT, which features DJ Quik as well as Snoop Dogg.

Riley produced and co-wrote the song &quot;Teeth&quot; with Lady Gaga for her EP &quot;The Fame Monster&quot;. Speaking in March 2010 to &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot;&#x27;s Pete Lewis, Riley said that he was no longer affiliated with Guy (Riley had last performed with the group in October 2010). Riley also said that the current lineup of Blackstreet consisted of himself, Chauncey &quot;Black&quot; Hannibal, Dave Hollister, and Sherman &quot;J-Stylz&quot; Tisdale. He confirmed that he was working on a new Blackstreet album, though intended to release his own album – entitled &quot;TRX&quot; – first. Artists he could possibly be working with for the project included Stevie Wonder and Elton John, plus his own new, upcoming acts. However, Hannibal stopped performing with the group and the lineup became Riley, Hollister, Mark Middleton, and Eric Williams. In 2012, Hannibal returned to Blackstreet; Middleton and Williams left the group. As of 2019, the group&#x27;s lineup now consists of Riley, Hollister, J-Stylz, and Rodney Poe under the name &quot;Blackstreet 2&quot;.

In an August 2010, co-executor of the Michael Jackson estate, John Branca, confirmed that a posthumous album of Jackson would be released, containing work done in the previous five years with producers Theron &quot;Neff-U&quot; Feemster, Christopher &quot;Tricky&quot; Stewart, and Riley, as well as work written and produced solely by Jackson himself. The album &quot;Michael&quot; was released on December 14, 2010, in the United States. After the release, several people questioned some of the music Riley produced for the project. Riley insisted all of the songs were sung by Jackson and claimed that vocal artifacts were added from overprocessing Jackson&#x27;s voice. However, Riley made comments in an interview with Dan Dodds (also known as Soul Jones) in which he stated that there were some elements of his voice in the music. Riley is reported to have said, &quot;They may use some elements from me, put together ideas but I haven&#x27;t been working on the new album.&quot;

Recently, Riley has stepped into the Korean music market. Riley worked with rapper Jay Park on an English track titled &quot;Demon&quot;, which was originally meant for Michael Jackson. Riley produced a mini-album for the girl group Rania.

He produced the tracks &quot;Believe&quot; and &quot;Flow&quot; by the R&amp;B group Boyz II Men for the album &quot;Twenty&quot;. He has also produced Korean girl group Girls&#x27; Generation&#x27;s single &quot;The Boys&quot; for the group&#x27;s first international release. He has also produced songs for Girls&#x27; Generation&#x27;s labelmates Shinee and Exo. He worked with Shinee on &quot;Beautiful&quot;, &quot;Shine&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous&quot; from their two-part third studio album &quot;The Misconceptions of Us&quot;. Riley also produced the songs &quot;Milk&quot; and &quot;All Night&quot; for f(x)&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Red Light&quot; and the song &quot;What Is Love&quot; for Exo.
