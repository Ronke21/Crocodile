<text>Trevor Martin Chappell (born 12 October 1952) is a former Australian cricketer, a member of the South Australian Chappell family which excelled at cricket. He played 3 tests and 20 One Day Internationals for Australia. He won the Sheffield Shield with New South Wales twice, and scored a century for Australia against India in the 1983 World Cup. His career was overshadowed, however, by an incident in 1981 in which he bowled an underarm delivery to New Zealand cricketer Brian McKechnie to prevent the batsman from hitting a six.

After retiring from first class cricket in 1986, Chappell went on to become fielding coach for the Sri Lanka cricket team in 1996, and in 2001 became coach of the Bangladesh cricket team. He later was the coach of the Singapore cricket team.

==Early life==
Chappell was the youngest of the Chappell cricketing brothers, his two elder brothers being Ian and Greg, and the grandson of former Australian captain Vic Richardson. Chappell grew up playing cricket in the backyard with his brothers, and like them was coached by Lynn Foster and attended Prince Alfred College.

Greg Chappell later recalled, &quot;I was going to be every bit the tyrant to Trevor that Ian had been to me. But TC was his own man. Trevor was quiet and unassuming, but if you pushed him too far, he&#x27;d explode. That&#x27;s TC through and through: very passive most of the time, easy going, but push him too far and there&#x27;s an explosion coming.&quot;

Chappell&#x27;s childhood hero was Keith Miller. Throughout his early playing career he was a batsman, although his excellent fielding at cover also brought him attention. &quot;I figured the cover region was the area where the ball went more often than not, so I thought it was a good spot to field&quot;, he later said. &quot;It keeps you occupied and always in the game.&quot;

Over the summer of 1969/70 he toured the West Indies with the Australian Schoolboys XI, a team that also included Gary Gilmour, Gary Cosier and Ian Davis. During the tour he came down with chicken pox. He recovered to score 52 against St Kitts.

Chappell also played for South Australia in the Australian Schoolboys Cricket Council Championships in Sydney.

==Early career: 1972–77==
===South Australia===
Chappell debuted for South Australia in the 1972–73 season, replacing Ken Cunningham who had to drop out for business reasons. He later recalled:
When I first got picked for South Australia, Ian said, &quot;You got to decide what sort of a player you want to be – whether you want to be an aggressive, attacking player, or more like a grafting sort of player.&quot; I had to think about that and that I&#x27;m not really a free hitter of the ball, so the choice I made was I was going to be more of a grafter.
His career began well, scoring 67 on debut. He made half-centuries in his next two games, but struggled thereafter and was eventually dropped from the South Australian side. Chappell:
When I first played for South Australia, I did all right. Then I got injured right at the start of the second season – I broke my nose and cheekbone in a fielding accident. I damaged my shoulder as well. I couldn&#x27;t throw very well. Fielding has always been one of my main skills and I lost confidence in the fielding. I wasn&#x27;t getting any runs, I wasn&#x27;t bowling much in those days, and I wasn&#x27;t fielding terribly well either. I ended up playing all of the first-class season and had a bad season. I still couldn&#x27;t get runs in South Australia the following season but I&#x27;d go to England and get runs. I got dropped from the South Australian team.

In 1975 Chappell played for Walsden in the Central Lancashire Cricket League over the English summer. It was a highly successful season for Chappell, who found his medium pace bowling effective on English wickets. He ended up making 1,268 runs at an average of 52.8 and taking 106 wickets at an average of 14 – the first &quot;double&quot; of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in the Central League since 1961.

Over the 1975–76 Australian summer Chappell toured South Africa as part of DH Robins XI, a special invitational side managed by Richie Benaud. Chappell&#x27;s teammates included David Steele and Geoff Howarth. Chappell later said &quot;I ... did all right&quot; on the tour. Highlights included scoring 69 against Transvaal.

He returned to England in 1976 and enjoyed another successful English summer in the Lancashire League, this time for East Lancashire.

===Western Australia===
Chappell then received an offer to play for the Scarborough Cricket Club in Perth and moved to Western Australia. He had a run of strong games with scores of 48, 88, 43 and 76. This led to him playing four first class games for Western Australia in 1976–77, in which he scored two fifties at an average of 40.

In 1977, he played for East Lancashire again in the Lancashire League.

==World Series Cricket==
In 1977, Chappell signed to play for World Series Cricket along with his brothers. He had failed to make the first team for WA for the 1977–78 season when Dennis Lillee approached him. Chappell later recalled, &quot;Lillee said to me, &quot;Bad luck about not making it in the WA team. Don&#x27;t worry, something better might come along.&quot; I had no idea what he meant. And a few days later [Austin] Robinson, Dennis&#x27; manager, rang and said, &quot;Do you want to join World Series Cricket&quot; and I said, &quot;Yeah, where do I sign?&quot;&quot;

Chappell played ten games for WSC Australia in the Country Cup in 1977–78, scoring 339 runs, more than any other Australian batsman, although his average was only 26.

A highlight was a 110 he scored against the West Indies in Albury. He also scored 56 off 300 minutes against a World XI in a Lismore game which resulted in him being booed by the crowd for slow scoring. &quot;Trevor Chappell batted exceptionally well and he did not deserve the rubbishing the crowd gave him&quot;, said Australian captain Ross Edwards.

Over the 1978–79 season Chappell mostly played for the WSC Cavaliers, a team of players of various nationalities who were not selected for the top three WSC teams, competing in the Cavaliers Cup.

&quot;We had a whole mixture and nobody probably really wanted to be there&quot;, recalled Chappell. &quot;They would rather be in the main games. We had some surprising results. We won a few games we probably weren&#x27;t expected to.&quot;

Chappell enjoyed good form that season, which he partly attributed to the captaincy of Eddie Barlow. &quot;Eddie once said to me early on in the series, &#x27;You gotta stop trying to play like Ian or Greg and play like you. Just be Trevor.&#x27; That definitely helped me through World Series.&quot;

Chappell&#x27;s highlights that season included 93 against the West Indies and 126, 96 and 72 against the World XI.

Chappell led the aggregates out of all players in the Country Tour, making 629 runs at an average of 33.1, including one century and four half centuries.

This form helped earn Chappell selection in the Australian XI one-day team for the International Cup that summer (he played in three games with a top score of 14) and also on the Australian XI in the West Indies in 1979.

In the West Indies Chappell was picked in the first four of the Supertests, but was unable to reprise his Australian form in the Caribbean, his highest score in the Test matches and One Day Internationals being 28. During the first Test he was struck in the face by a delivery from Andy Roberts and required stitches.

==Post-WSC==
===1979–80: Move to New South Wales===
When World Series Cricket ended in 1979, Chappell moved to Sydney and started playing for the club Gordon. He started off the season with 55 for a Rick McCosker XI against a Ross Edwards XI in a trial game. This ensured his selection in the New South Wales side for the first Sheffield Shield match that summer, meaning Chappell had now played for three states. He was preferred to non-WSC-aligned batsman John Dyson, which caused some controversy at the time.

Chappell was under pressure to justify his selection but responded with 150 against West Australia, helping New South Wales win. He later scored 144 against Tasmania 76 not out against Queensland and 80 against the touring English.

Chappell made 674 runs at 42.12. He started to bowl more (five wickets at 14.8), and his fielding by now was amongst the best in the country; he began to be discussed as an international prospect. In April 1980 one Sydney journalist suggested &quot;he must be close to winning the remaining batting place&quot; in the Australian squad to tour England in 1980.

===1980–81: One Day International Player===
Chappell began the 1980–81 summer scoring 110 in a grade match for Gordon. His bowling spell of 3–22 helped NSW defeat Queensland.

In November, Chappell was selected in the Australian one-day side against New Zealand alongside Shaun Graf; although Chappell had only scored 121 runs at 31.5 in five innings (39, 2, 50, 19 and 16) his bowling (four wickets for 90) and fielding were seen as benefits by selectors who wanted an all rounder. &quot;The Age&quot; called it a &quot;shock selection&quot;. It was the first time three brothers had been selected for Australia.

Both Graf and Trevor Chappell were picked in the side. Australia lost the game. Chappell managed only 12 runs and took 0–21 with the ball, but he did run out Geoff Howarth. He did not bat or bowl in his second game, also against New Zealand.

Chappell was kept in the team to play India, taking 1–14 and scoring 14. His figures for his next game were 0–27 and 6, then 1–40,

Chappel&#x27;s position in NSW&#x27;s Shield team was under threat from Dirk Wellham after making 133 runs at 26 but Chappell then scored 111 for New South Wales against Queensland.

When the game ended Chappell discovered he had been picked in the Australian twelve to play the third test against New Zealand, replacing Shaun Graf (although Graf was kept in the 13 man squad to play India). &quot;The Age&quot; wrote &quot;in some ways Chappell&#x27;s incursion is hard to explain. Despite his fielding brilliance, he is not a front line bowler and can hardly lay claim to first call on a vacant position as a Test middle order batsman&quot;, suggesting Graham Yallop, Peter Toohey or David Boon would be better. Chappell was made twelfth man for the test match. However Rod Marsh suggested Chappell and/or Graeme Beard could be selected on the 1981 Ashes as a specialist one day player, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t speak too highly for his fielding. There&#x27;s no doubt he has lifted our performance in the field.&quot; Chappell had to make way for the next test – the first test against India – when Graf returned from injury, although Graf would only play as twelfth man.

He was dropped from the one-day side to make way for Jim Higgs, but soon returned. He took 2–42 against India (including the wicket of Gavaskar), 1–21 and 0 in a narrow loss against New Zealand (dropping John Wright, who scored 78, on 20), 14 against India and 14 against New Zealand.

Chappell scored 100 as a temporary opener for NSW in a three day game again New Zealand. He managed to keep his place in the Australian ODI squad for the World Series Cricket finals against New Zealand. In the second final Chappell took 2–21. In February 1981, Ian Chappell listed his possible squad for the Ashes. He wrote &quot;if another batsman is needed for any reason, then Trevor Chappell would be my selection because he can bat anywhere in the order and is the best cover field in Australia.&quot; This recommendation would be overshadowed by what happened in the third final.

===Underarm incident===

Chappell became infamous after bowling an underarm delivery when playing for Australia during a match against New Zealand in 1981. Australia scored 235 batting first; Trevor Chappell bowled the last over in which he dismissed Richard Hadlee and Ian Smith (His figures would be 2-57). New Zealand needed to score six runs off the last ball to tie the match. Not wanting to risk this, Greg Chappell, Australia&#x27;s captain, asked Trevor how his underarm bowling was. When Trevor Chappell replied that he didn&#x27;t know because he had never bowled underarm, Greg Chappell said, &quot;well there is only one way to find out&quot; and then Trevor Chappell rolled the ball along the ground to batsman Brian McKechnie.

Underarm bowling, allowed at the time by the rules of the series, but already outlawed at the time in England&#x27;s domestic competition, is no longer permitted in games under the playing regulations directly controlled by the ICC. In terms of The Laws of Cricket (Law 24.1b), underarm bowling is permitted in other matches provided that the captains agree to it prior to the start of the match.

Although it was not universally illegal to bowl underarm at the time, it was widely accepted to be contrary to the spirit of the game. A visibly agitated McKechnie could do little but block the ball to avoid being dismissed, then throwing his bat away in disgust, and so Australia won the game. It was described as &quot;the most disgusting incident I can recall in the history of cricket&quot; by the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Robert Muldoon.

Chappell played in the fourth final, taking 1–41.

He returned to Sheffield Shield making 71 against WA, and 59 and 0 against Tasmania. This form, and his bowling and fielding, helped Chappell be selected on the squad to tour England for the 1981 Ashes. Trevor Chappell&#x27;s selection – when he had made 2,259 first class runs at 31 and taken 15 wickets at 27 – was generally held to be surprise, as was that of fellow NSW batter Dirk Wellham especially considering Doug Walters had not been selected. (The other main surprise was the selection of Ray Bright over Bruce Yardley and Jim Higgs, who had both played test cricket that summer.) &quot;The Age&quot; reported Trevor Chappell &quot;must be the first Australian cricketer to have won a major tour berth on the strength of his brilliant fielding.&quot;

===1981 Ashes===
Greg Chappell chose not to tour England in 1981, and there was much speculation over who would take his spot at number three in the batting line-up. During the early stages of the tour it was thought Martin Kent would take his place at number three, and Chappell only play one-dayers and tour games. However, Kent displayed poor form while Chappell was more consistent with scores of 47 against Somerset and 91 against Gloucestershire. Brian Mossop of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said Chappell &quot;came to Australia assured of a place in the one day internationals but needing to show great fortitutde to win a test berth. He is mounting an appreciable challenge... His ability to offer a broad bat is a quality that is not much in evidence other than by John Dyson.&quot;

Chappell was selected in the Australian side to play the first ODI. Batting at three he scored 16. In the second ODI he was prompted to opener but scored a first ball duck and returned bowling figures of 1-69. In the third ODI he made 14 but took 3-31 to help Australia win the game and the series (the first time Australia had won the pre-Ashes ODI series in England since it was introduced in 1972). Kim Hughes said &quot;Trevor Chappell epitomised what this team&#x27;s built on – few stars but a good gutsy effort.&quot;

As the tour went on, Chappell&#x27;s form was not particularly good but Kent&#x27;s was worse (he had a highest score of 28), and it was felt the other batsman, Dirk Wellham, was too inexperienced. All three batters were selected to play Derbyshire – Chappell made 14, Kent 2, Wellham 47. Against Middlesex, Chappell made 18 and 7 but Kent and Wellham did not play. In the end, Chappell was selected in the first Test to bat at number three. Peter McFarline of &quot;The Age&quot; wrote &quot;although he is a courageous player he is not really the man for the job but he will be there because the only other contender... Kent has failed to come to terms with English conditions.&quot; Kim Hughes said &quot;Trevor has batted at number three for New South Wales and faced all of the top Australian bowlers. I think he will do a good job for us. I don&#x27;t believe it is asking too much of him to bat in such a crucial position in his first test.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;d never really expected to play Test cricket – three family members had already played, what were the chances of a fourth?&quot; said Trevor Chappell. &quot;Then I was involved in World Series Cricket, throw in the underarm and the odds were getting longer. So when it did happen, it was a great thrill.&quot; Chappell&#x27;s father Martin, in England at the time, said &quot;It&#x27;s a proud moment for me... Now that Trevor&#x27;s got there I hope he makes a good fist for it.&quot;

In the final event, Chappell&#x27;s first innings saw him come in at number five with Graham Yallop at three. He was dropped by ian Botham when on five, and made 17 runs over 122 minutes. In the second innings, he came to the wicket when Australia was 3-77 chasing 132; he made 20 over 94 minutes, and hit the winning runs as Australia won by four wickets.

Chappell kept his place in the team for the second Test but failed twice, scoring 2 and 5 (in an hour). Despite this poor result, in the next tour game, against Northampton, Chappell scored 71 and Kent failed again (Dirk Wellham scored 135), so the selectors – Kim Hughes, Rod Marsh and Peter Philpott – picked Chappell for the third test. This time Chappell was promoted to number three.

This match passed into legend. In Australia&#x27;s first innings, Chappell scored 27 over 161 minutes, helping Australia reach 401, notably taking part in a 94-run partnership with John Dyson. England were dismissed for 174, Kim Hughes enforced the follow-on, and at one stage England were 7–135 in response. Then Ian Botham began one of the most famous counter-attacks in Test cricket, scoring 149 not out and helping England reach 356. Chappell was never called upon to bowl. Australia had to score 130 to win. Chappell came to the wicket when Australia were 1–13 – he and Dyson took them to 56, with Chappell making 8 off 56 balls. He was then dismissed, which triggered a collapse; Australia lost the match by 18 runs.

The fighting quality of Chappell&#x27;s innings had been noted, and it was not a foregone conclusion that he would be dropped. However, by this stage Martin Kent had rediscovered his form with a score of 92 against Worcestershire (Wellham made 52), and he was selected in the Australian eleven for the fourth Test, with Chappell made twelfth man.

Australia lost the fourth test and there was some media talk that Chappell might find his way back in the team for the fifth test in place of Graham Yallop, who had shown weakness against fast bowling. Chappell scored 46 in a tour game, but then it seemed the wicket for the fifth test would take spin, which Yallop excelled at playing, so he kept his spot and Chappell remained twelfth man.

Chappell then won a man-of-the-match award for hitting 63 in a one-day game against Leicestershire. However, Dirk Wellham was preferred to him in the sixth Test.

===1981 to 1983===
At the beginning of the 1981–82 summer, Chappell was still mentioned as a Test prospect. &quot;Trevor Chappell cannot be left out of calculation&quot;, wrote one journalist. &quot;He is resourceful, can bat early or late, bowls a penetrative medium pacer and fields brilliantly.&quot; However, Chappell never played Test cricket again. &quot;Being on a tour that is not very successful probably damns your chances to get another go&quot;, he later reflected.

Chappell did participate in a 219-run stand against Tasmania for NSW in January 1982. He later took 4–35 against WA in a McDonald&#x27;s Cup match, and in a crucial Sheffield Shield game against Victoria he took 4–12 and made 47 runs.

Chappell began the following summer poorly when hit by a ball at training. He recovered, and went on to deliver a number of excellent performances for NSW, including 92 against South Australia, 61 against England, 89 against New Zealand in a one-day game and 132 against Queensland. Reviewing the latter innings, which was Chappell&#x27;s fourth Shield century, Bill O&#x27;Reilly wrote that &quot;serious consideration&quot; should be given to Chappell getting back in the Australian team.

The highlight of Chappell&#x27;s summer came during the Sheffield Shield final, where New South Wales played Western Australia in Perth. Chappell only scored 10 and 33 with the bat, but he took 3-32 in Western Australia&#x27;s first innings and 4-45 in their second. This effort was crucial in helping bowl New South Wales to victory. It was the state&#x27;s first Shield in seventeen years.

Chappell then took 2-32 in a McDonald&#x27;s Cup game semi-final against Queensland. He ended the season with 633 first class runs and 27 wickets plus eleven catches.

===1983 World Cup===
Chappell&#x27;s efforts over the summer resulted in a surprise selection for the 14-man Australian&#x27;s 1983 World Cup squad in May 1983. His ODI record was 16 games, 90 runs at 10 and 15 wickets at 29.6 but Chappell&#x27;s experience in England was thought to have given him the edge over his main rival, Ken MacLeay. He said at the time:
I thought I was in with a chance but I didn&#x27;t want to build up my hopes. The way I worked it out, it was to be me or Ken MacLeay and I knew I had a few years experience on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.
Trevor Chappell was going to the World Cup as part of a travel business he had with Doug Walters, but had to cancel. Ken Macleay ended up joining the squad anyway, when Greg Chappell fell injured and elected not to tour. Captain Kim Hughes said &quot;with the utmost respect to Trevor and Ken we haven&#x27;t got a world class all rounder.&quot;

Chappell was made 12th man for Australia&#x27;s early games. He was selected for a game against India and promoted to opener – he responded by scoring 110 of 131 balls. However, he found less success in later matches – although he took 3-47 against Zimbabwe. Reviewing the tour Peter Mcfarline wrote Chappell &quot;helped the side enormously with a century against India but lack of class both as a batsman and a bowler is exposed at this level.&quot;

He never played for Australia again after the tournament. Chappell later recalled:
I preferred to open the batting or bat in the top order somewhere. But I probably wasn&#x27;t good enough to bat at No. 3 or No. 4, which is why I was where I was – down at the bottom. It just depended if we had couple of good openers so I wasn&#x27;t going to get a go there and at No. 3 or No. 4 or even at 5, 6, so 7 is where I got a go in the international side.

==Later career==
A series of indifferent performances led to Chappell being dropped by New South Wales during the 1983–84 season. He was kept on in the one day team and scored 54 against the Australian Capital Territory.

During the opening game of the 1984–85 season Chappell was again dropped from the NSW Shield team down to 12th man. However he was kept in the side for the McDonald&#x27;s Cup. Injuries to players and national selection duties meant Chappell found himself back in the team. New South Wales ended up winning both the Sheffield Shield and the McDonald&#x27;s Cup that season.

During the 1985–86 summer, Chappell was suspended for two premiership matches in Sydney&#x27;s grade competition for disputing an umpire&#x27;s decision.

==Later life==
Chappell retired from first-class cricket in 1986; however, he continued to play grade cricket with the North Sydney cricket club, leading them to a premiership.
He went on to coach the Gordon Women&#x27;s cricket club.

In 1987, he and Brian McKechnie reunited to play a double wicket game together in New Zealand.

He was a fielding coach for Sri Lanka from 1996 to 2000 and had a short stint as national coach for Bangladesh. &quot;I’m lucky coaching came along because I couldn’t bear the thought of office work&quot;, he said later. He says coaching Bangladesh was a very rough job because of the language barrier. He was sacked as coach of Bangladesh in April 2002 after the team lost ten out of its first eleven Tests.

In 2003, Chappell, along with his brothers, were honoured by the South Australian Cricket Association when a new stand in the Adelaide Oval was named the Chappell Stand after the cricketing brothers.

Chappell then became coach of the 1st XI cricket team at The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta over the Australian summer. He also began coaching the Singapore National Cricket Team. In 2006, he also participated in a game to celebrate former teammate Robert Holland&#x27;s 60th birthday, as well as Greg Matthews, David Gilbert, Rick McCosker and Greg Dyer at Toronto, NSW.

From July to September 2009, he undertook a 50-day stint as coach of Singapore for its ICC World Cricket League Division 6 tournament, held in Singapore.

In 2013, he said about coaching in Singapore that &quot;I have never had my best 11 together during a training session. It is very disjointed and players offer excuses not to train, some of which are probably not legitimate. The players are amateur, so there isn’t always the motivation to come to training. The work schedule is long and players can’t leave work early for cricket here. So, as coach it means having to do things over and over again because we can’t get guys together.&quot; &quot;I wouldn’t mind being more involved with helping the New South Wales juniors&quot;, he said. &quot;Unfortunately, the cricket associations seem to look at players from the 1970s and ‘80s as from a bygone era. I have tried a few times to get a more prominent gig in Australia but it never progressed anywhere.&quot;

==Personal life==
Chappell married Lorraine Gavin in Canberra in 1981; Graeme Watson was his best man.

&quot;There is not a lot non-cricketing that I have done really&quot;, he said in a later interview. &quot;I&#x27;m not married and don&#x27;t have any kids, so that is a very short story. I was married, shortly after the underarm actually, in March 1981 and then divorced before the 1980s had finished.&quot;

<text>The Sims 2 is a 2004 social simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. It is the second major title in &quot;The Sims&quot; series, and is the sequel to &quot;The Sims&quot;. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on September 14, 2004, and a port for MacOS by Aspyr was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine &quot;stuff packs&quot; were subsequently released between 2005 and 2008. In addition, versions of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; were released on various video game consoles, including the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Nintendo DS, and GameCube, and mobile platforms, including the Nokia Ovi Store. Unlike the original, the handheld and console versions are more storyline-based. The three handheld versions of the game are completely different among themselves, unlike the home console versions of the game, which are virtually identical to each other. A sequel, &quot;The Sims 3&quot;, was released in June 2009.

Like its predecessor, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; allows the player to create and dress characters called &quot;Sims&quot;, design neighborhoods, and build and furnish houses. Players manage their Sims from birth to death, forming relationships in a manner similar to real life. Sims have life goals, wants, and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce good or bad outcomes. First incorporated in the console versions of &quot;The Sims&quot;, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; was the first PC game in the series to incorporate a complete 3D graphics engine of the game world. This allows the player to get 360º views as opposed to the fixed 2D isometric view of &quot;The Sims&quot;. Genetics are also a new game mechanic; children in &quot;The Sims&quot; that were born in-game were randomly generated. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines and scripted events exist in the game&#x27;s pre-built neighborhoods.

&quot;The Sims 2&quot; was critically acclaimed, and it has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It was also a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time. It contributed to &quot;The Sims&quot; series reaching 100 million copies in April 2008. By March 2012, the game had sold 13 million copies over all platforms with over six million PC copies, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time. The game was re-released on Steam and EA desktop in January 2025 to coincide with the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Sims&quot; series.

== Gameplay ==
From the neighborhood view, the player selects one lot to play, as in &quot;The Sims&quot;. While there are both residential and community lots, Sims can only live in residential lots. Sims can travel to community lots in order to purchase things like clothing and magazines, and to interact with NPCs and townies. The player can choose between playing a pre-made inhabited lot, moving a household into an unoccupied pre-built lot, or constructing a building on an empty lot. One novelty from &quot;The Sims&quot; is foundations. The player switches among the Live mode (default) to control Sims, the Buy mode to add, move, or delete furniture, and the Build mode to rebuild the house and make structural changes. Although the Buy and Build modes cannot be accessed when on a community lot, the lots can be built on by using the neighborhood view. It is also possible to import neighborhood terrains from &quot;SimCity 4&quot;.

The game contains some time-bound social challenges that provide a reward if successful. Sims can throw parties to gain aspiration points or invite the headmaster over for dinner in order to enroll their children in private school. Some expansion packs have new mini-games like running a Greek house in &quot;University&quot;, or dating in &quot;Nightlife&quot;. In &quot;Nightlife&quot;, each date is a challenge to keep both Sims as happy as possible while accumulating aspiration points. Various other expansion packs introduce supernatural characters which Sims can be turned into, such as Zombies, Vampires, Werewolves, PlantSims, and Witches.

=== Sims ===

The main part of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby several times. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) pregnant before giving birth to a baby. During Pregnancy, the belly does not expand gradually. Instead, every day, it pops to a bigger size. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby&#x27;s appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby&#x27;s appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling adoption service on the phone, even by single parents, old age sims or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for the toddler to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a teenager, and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an elder. An elder will eventually die; the length of this final stage depends on the aspiration bar when they become an elder.

Babies, toddlers, children, teens, and adults can be advanced to their next life stage at any time during the 24 Sim hours before they will grow up automatically. For babies, this requires using the birthday cake. Toddlers, children, teens, and adults can use the &quot;Grow Up&quot; self-interaction. If the university expansion pack is installed, teens have the option to go to college, where they will be young adults for approximately 24 days. Aging can be disabled via cheats. Poor choices can have consequences. Players will need to build up talent badges, skills, and relationships with other people, so that they can be successful in their career. A player will also need to make sure a Sim is happy and well by fulfilling wants (including lifetime wants, avoiding fears, and fulfilling motives). Pregnancy, toddlers, teens, and elders are new stages of life. Young adult is a unique age added with the &quot;University&quot; expansion. Teen Sims will become young adults once they are moved to a university, and will be adults once they leave campus, regardless of the reason.

==== Create-a-Sim ====

In &quot;The Sims 2&quot;, Create a Family is entered by clicking the &quot;Families&quot; button in the lower left-hand corner of the neighborhood view, then clicking the large &quot;Create New Family&quot; button. Clicking the button labeled &quot;Create A Sim&quot; will expand a tab which has the &quot;Create a Sim&quot; and &quot;Make a Child&quot; icons. &quot;Make a Child&quot; will be grayed out unless the family contains an adult male and adult female. Clicking the &quot;Create a Sim&quot; icon will generate a random adult Sim, who may be male or female which can be edited by the player. As opposed to &quot;The Sims&quot;, any age besides baby or young adult (which must be made in the University Create a Student tool) may be created. Instead of having to choose from already finished faces which include hair, it is now possible to alter the facial structure (e.g. widening the nose, thinning the lips, elongating the chin, and so on) and choose any hairstyle to go with it. Different eye colors and an additional skin tone is available for the Sims as well. If Sims are older than a child, their aspiration and turn-ons/offs (&quot;Nightlife&quot; or later) may be determined. There are ten personality traits which are: sloppy, neat, shy, outgoing, lazy, active, serious, playful, grouchy, and nice but only 25 personality points which can be assigned to those traits.

In &quot;The Sims 2&quot;, all personality points must be assigned. Additionally, there are twelve pre-set personalities, one for each zodiac sign. A zodiac sign will be set which matches the personality the player has selected for the Sim. A sim also has one of eight Aspirations which is a lifetime goal that strongly influences their Wants and Fears which are: Grow Up (only for toddler and child Sims), Romance, Family, Knowledge, Popularity, Fortune, Pleasure (&quot;Nightlife&quot; or later), and the Grilled Cheese aspiration (&quot;Nightlife&quot; or later, and can only be set as a Sim&#x27;s main aspiration if they use the ReNuYuSenso Orb machine and it malfunctions). &quot;The Sims 2&quot; comes with The Sims 2 Body Shop, which enables users to create custom genetics, make-up, clothes, and Sims, with the help of third-party tools, such as Microsoft Paint, Paint.NET, Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, and SimPE.

=== Social interactions ===
There are several new social interactions introduced in &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. These new social interactions can create memories and can be related to certain age groups. Social interactions can come up in the Wants and Fears panel and can be dependent on the Sim&#x27;s personality and aspiration. Sims with certain personalities may not want to complete certain social interactions.
* Influence
:Influencing social interactions are introduced in the &quot;University&quot; expansion pack. A Sim is able to influence another Sim to complete a social interaction or a chore. Sims gain influence points by completing Wants and can lose influence points by completing Fears. The size of the influence bar depends on the number of friends the Sim has. It also can grow in size with business perks from the &quot;Open for Business&quot; expansion pack. Influence was also in the Nightlife expansion but added nothing.
* Chemistry
:The &quot;Nightlife&quot; expansion pack introduced a new feature, Turn-Ons and Turn-Offs. Teenagers and older are able to choose their turn-ons and turn-offs. These and other factors such as aspiration and personality, determine the chemistry that one Sim has with another in the form of lightning bolts. Sims can have up to three lightning bolts with another Sim. The higher the chemistry is that a Sim has with another Sim, the greater the chance for social interactions to be accepted. New turn-ons and turn-offs are introduced with the &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; expansion pack.
* Fury
:Fury is introduced in the &quot;Nightlife&quot; expansion pack and occurs when one Sim gets angry at another. During this time relationships with the Sim who is furious are harder to build. Also, the Sim who is furious may pick a fight or vandalize the home lot of the Sim they are furious with. Fury can be caused by another Sim burgling the Sim&#x27;s house, getting fined after calling emergency services when there was no emergency, fighting, cheating on (the cheater or the Sim that was cheated with, often both), and more.
* Reputation
:Reputation, which is found in the previous Sims game &quot;The Urbz: Sims in the City&quot;, is reintroduced in the &quot;Apartment Life&quot; expansion pack. A Sim gains reputation by interacting with other Sims on community lots. Sims with higher reputations are more likely to gain perks such as free objects and job promotions.

=== Careers ===
There are 25 careers (counting all expansion packs) that come with the game that require skills and a certain number of friends in order for promotion. Each career track has ten levels. Success in these careers unlocks career rewards and higher salaries plus bonuses. Sims also receive chance cards. Correct answers to these chance cards creates rewards for Sims while incorrect answers could cause a Sim to lose its job. &quot;Nightlife&quot; and &quot;Apartment Life&quot; allow Sims to gain promotions through social interactions with other Sims.

=== Neighborhoods ===

&quot;The Sims 2&quot; ships with three pre-made worlds, known as neighborhoods for the player to explore, all with a specific theme and storylines. These worlds are Pleasantview, a continuation of the playable neighborhood from &quot;The Sims&quot;, featuring many of the same families, such as the Goths and the Pleasants – Strangetown, a small desert town themed around the supernatural, with aliens, mad scientists and haunted graveyards. The final neighborhood, Veronaville, is a European-themed town based on the works of William Shakespeare, with its central plot being a loose, modern retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Aside from these pre-made neighborhoods, players can create and populate towns of their own, using built-in presets, or create their own entirely using &quot;SimCity 4&quot;, since &quot;SimCity 4&quot; maps are compatible with &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. Additionally, although &quot;SimCity 4&quot; has powerful tools for terraforming, only the middle section of the map is usable in &quot;The Sims 2&quot;.

Expansion packs add several new neighborhoods, such as university towns, a shopping district, a downtown area and several vacation destinations. &quot;Seasons&quot; adds a fully-fledged neighborhood, a rural small town called Riverblossom Hills, &quot;Free Time&quot; adds a hobby-themed town named Desiderata Valley, while &quot;Apartment Life&quot; adds Belladonna Cove, a bigger, more metropolitan area featuring apartments and high-rises.

=== Comparison to &quot;The Sims&quot; ===
Graphically, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; is more detailed than &quot;The Sims&quot; and lets players view its world in full 3D. This is a change from earlier Sim games, such as &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;, which used dimetric projection and fixed resolutions, as the camera was in &quot;The Sims&quot;. In &quot;The Sims&quot;, Sims are 3D meshes, but &quot;The Sims 2&quot; introduces far more detail in mesh quality, texture quality, and animation capability. A Sim&#x27;s facial features are customizable and unique, and Sims can smile, frown, and blink. The player can adjust a Sim&#x27;s features in the in-game Create-a-Sim tool; for example, noses can be made to be very large or very small. Texturing is achieved through use of raster images, although it appears more lifelike. The &quot;GameSpot&quot; review wrote of how &quot;The Sims 2&quot; is &quot;powered by an all-new 3D graphics engine so it looks much better than the original game did.&quot;

&quot;The Sims 2&quot; characters pass through seven life stages — babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with &quot;University&quot;), adults, and elders — with eventual death of old age, while babies in &quot;The Sims&quot; only become children before ceasing to age further. The aspiration system is also new to &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits as opposed to &quot;The Sims&quot;, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics play a major role in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role than they did in the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child. Some of the other additions to gameplay are career rewards, a week cycle, the cleaning skill (which was a hidden skill in &quot;The Sims&quot;), a variety of meals (depending on time of day), exercise clothing, body shape affected by diet and exercise, and houses built on foundations. Cutscenes were another new feature in &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. There are cutscenes featuring first kiss, woohoo, child birth, going to college and graduating in &quot;The Sims 2: University&quot;, and alien abductions.

== Development ==
Preliminary development on &quot;The Sims 2&quot; began in late 2000 following the release of &quot;The Sims&quot;. EA Games announced on May 5, 2003, that the Maxis studio had begun development on &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. A teaser trailer was provided on &quot;The Sims: Makin&#x27; Magic&quot; CD, released October 2003, which was later uploaded to websites all over the Internet. The game was first shown at E3 in Los Angeles, California, on May 13, 2003. The development team decided that the core qualities that drew people to &quot;The Sims&quot; were that it was easily relatable to most people, gave players the freedom to be creative, had an irreverent sense of humor, and featured open-ended gameplay, and set out to build upon these aspects in the sequel. The move to 3D graphics was considered essential in getting players of the first game to upgrade. The development team considered adding thirst and stress needs but reconsidered after feedback from players showed that they were growing tired of maintaining their Sims&#x27; basic needs. Instead, the team focused on using the existing needs to differentiate the different life stages; for example, teenage Sims have a higher need for social interaction. Custom content was also considered an essential part of &quot;The Sims&quot;&#x27; popularity; to incentivize its creation, the team ensured that installing and managing user-made content was as smooth as possible. Will Wright stated that the reception to the expansion packs for the first game helped the team to decide which features to include in the base game, citing community lots as an example.

On December 15, 2012, Electronic Arts announced that the official website would be shut down on January 14, 2013. It is now no longer possible to download content from the official site, create exchanges, or participate in the official forum communities. On July 16, 2014, Electronic Arts announced the end of support for &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. As a response, &quot;The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection&quot;, containing the core game and all expansion packs and stuff packs, was released at the same time as a limited time offer. The game became available for free download from Origin exclusively following an announcement by EA that they would no longer be supporting the game. This offer ended at 10:00 PDT July 31, 2014.

On August 7, 2014, Aspyr Media released &quot;The Sims 2: Super Collection&quot; as digital download exclusively available at the Mac App Store; the game was updated for OS X Mavericks, 4K, and Retina. This compilation only includes the first six expansion packs and the first three stuff packs. Aspyr stated they were unable to include the remaining packs for the game due to licensing conflicts with EA. Like the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, no new updates on when the remaining packs were to be released separately or as a single add-on to the &quot;Super Collection&quot; emerged. In his &quot;York Vision&quot; review of the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, Tom Davies wrote &quot;it really is quite difficult to make the mind boggling grandness of &quot;The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection&quot; live for you. By the time Maxis gave up on bringing out expansions for it they had pretty much given you everything you could have ever wanted the game to have, and a whole heap of stuff you never considered but are grateful for anyway. ... The thing is, if anything there is too much game. You just don&#x27;t know what to do first or how on earth you&#x27;re going to get round to doing it all, it&#x27;s like being a six year old in Toys&#x27;R&#x27;Us.&quot;

On January 31, 2025, EA released &quot;The Sims 2: Legacy Collection&quot; as a digital download via EA App and Steam to coincide with the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Sims&quot; series. This version of the game, a re-release of &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; (however lacking the &quot;IKEA Home Stuff&quot; pack because of &quot;modern licensing restrictions&quot;), was updated to fix graphical issues and performance bugs to run on modern computers with Windows 10 and 11.

== Music ==

Mark Mothersbaugh composed the build mode, buy mode, Create a Sim, neighborhood music, and main theme of &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. The game also features original Simlish-language songs on the radio, provided by Jerry Martin, The Humble Brothers, Kirk Casey, and others. In later expansion and stuffpacks, well-known recording artists provided Simlish versions of their songs for the in-game radio stations, including Depeche Mode, Kajagoogoo, Lily Allen, Datarock, Plain White T&#x27;s, and Katy Perry, among others. &quot;Pressure&quot; by Paramore, &quot;Don&#x27;t Cha&quot; by The Pussycat Dolls, &quot;Good Day&quot; by Tally Hall, and &quot;Like Light to the Flies&quot; by Trivium were among the songs re-recorded by their original artists in Simlish for the console version of &quot;The Sims 2&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;The Sims 2&quot; received widespread critical acclaim, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; average score of 90, based on 61 reviews, indicates &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. The game also received the Editor&#x27;s Choice Award from &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot; upon final review of the finished product. &quot;The Sims 2&quot; had a successful E3. From 71 online reviews, the average score was 90 out of 100. Seven of those sources awarded the game a 100-out-of-100 score. X-Play gave the game a 4/5. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; awarded the game as their 2004 &quot;Strategy Game of the Year (General)&quot;, beating out &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon 3&quot;, &quot;The Political Machine&quot;, and &quot;Silent Storm&quot;. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences awarded &quot;The Sims 2&quot; with &quot;Simulation Game of the Year&quot;, along with a nomination for &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;.

&quot;The Sims&quot;″ creator, Will Wright, was recognized by being nominated at the Billboard Digital Entertainment Awards for Visionary and Game Developer. The game was also nominated for two international awards in 2005. The Mac version of the game won an Apple Design Award in 2006. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;The Sims 2&quot; the sixth-best computer game of 2004. The editors wrote that it is &quot;more of a game and less of a dollhouse [than &quot;The Sims&quot;], but it remains a celebration of the beauty of the mundane.&quot; It also won the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best Voice Acting&quot; award.

&quot;The Sims 2&quot; was an instant commercial success, selling a then-record one million copies in its first ten days. The game sold 4.5 million units within its first year, and 7 million by October 2006. It received a &quot;Double Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. It received a &quot;Double Platinum&quot; award from the Asociación Española de Distribuidores y Editores de Software de Entretenimiento (aDeSe), for more than 160,000 sales in Spain during its first 12 months.

In April 2008, &quot;The Sims 2&quot;″s official website announced that 100 million copies of &quot;The Sims&quot; series had been sold. In June 2009, &quot;The Sims 3&quot; was released. As of March 2012, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; had sold 13 million units across all platforms with at least six million units on PC, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all time. The 2016 World Video Game Hall of Fame Inductees announced that 200 million copies of &quot;The Sims&quot; series had been sold, becoming one of the top best-selling video game franchises of all time. Even after subsequent &quot;Sims&quot; installments, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; still has an active fanbase. To this day, the game has a large modding community, with new user-created content being continually uploaded to fansites such as Mod The Sims and &quot;Sim&quot;-themed blogs hosted on Tumblr (nicknamed &quot;Simblrs&quot;).

== Controversy ==

&quot;The Sims 2&quot;″s malleable content and open-ended customization have led to controversy on the subject of pay sites. Custom content is distributed through independent websites, some of which charge for downloading materials. Charging money for custom content is considered a violation of the game&#x27;s EULA, which prohibits the commercial use of Electronic Arts&#x27; intellectual property. 

On July 22, 2005, Florida attorney Jack Thompson alleged that Electronic Arts and &quot;The Sims 2&quot; promoted nudity through the use of a mod or a cheat code. The claim was made that pubic hair, labia, and other genital details were visible once the blur (the pixelation that occurs when a Sim is using the toilet or is naked in the game) was removed. Electronic Arts executive Jeff Brown said in an interview with &quot;GameSpot&quot;: &quot;This is nonsense. We&#x27;ve reviewed 100 percent of the content. There is no content inappropriate for a teen audience. Players never see a nude Sim. If someone with an extreme amount of expertise and time were to remove the pixels, they would see that the sims have no genitals. They appear like Ken and Barbie.&quot; Prior to Thompson&#x27;s statement, there was an enterable code which allowed users to modify the size of the pixelation in the game; this had been left over from the beta testing stage of the game and was not intended for a public audience. Following the statement, subsequent patches and expansion packs removed this code.

== Editions, compilations, and add-ons ==
=== Mac OS X ===
Mac OS X ports of the base game, the first six expansion packs, and the first three Stuff Packs have been released by Aspyr Media. The port for the base game was announced on October 19, 2004. &quot;The Sims 2&quot; had reached beta status on March 1, 2005, and was released on June 17 the same year. The Sims 2 Body Shop was also available for Mac OS X. Aspyr Media released &quot;The Sims 2&quot; with all ported expansions and stuff packs as &quot;The Sims 2: Super Collection&quot; for Intel Macs in 2014. The game is available for purchase on the Mac App Store for OS X 10.9 Mavericks and above. At its release, it was compatible with Mac OS X Panther and above on PowerPC Macintosh systems. In its review, &quot;Macworld&quot; wrote: &quot;All told, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; is a technically impressive game that adds many new features to an already proven formula. And believe it or not, &quot;The Sims 2&quot; uses some of the most sophisticated and demanding 3-D graphics ever seen in a Mac game. A 1.2GHz or faster machine is absolutely mandatory. Owners of ATI graphics cards will want to update their cards with the latest drivers and firmware from ATI —this made a big difference with my X800 card.&quot;

=== Consoles ===
The console versions of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; featured local splitscreen multiplayer, a story mode, and an option to control game characters directly, as opposed to queuing options as is traditional &quot;Sims&quot; gameplay; however, unlike in the Windows PC and Mac OS X versions, it is not possible for Sims to have children or realistically age, as they are only adults (excluding elders), although they can get married. The player must earn aspiration points to unlock rewards by filling up the Sims goals, which would also be needed to complete story mode. Story mode is a sequence of multiple levels along with developed storylines which each character asks the player to fulfill wants that pertain to their story. There is also a sandbox mode where the player can live in a preset family or build their own.

In his review for &quot;GameSpot&quot;, Andrew Park wrote: &quot;It should probably go without saying that the Xbox version of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; looks the best on consoles, though the GameCube version also looks almost as sharp and clean. The PS2 version of the game, as you&#x27;d also expect, fares the worst, and it has a slightly blurrier look and shows a few more jaggies, especially in wide shots of houses and open lots. It also has noticeably longer load times, though this shouldn&#x27;t be surprising to any PS2 owners.&quot; In his review for &quot;GameRevolution&quot;, Mike Reilly wrote: &quot;Balancing such plusses and minuses while keeping the species afloat is the stuff life is made of, and as &quot;The Sims 2&quot; for the PC proved, also makes for a damn good video game. Unfortunately, the new console versions feel more like weak clones of the original rather than the vivacious offspring we hoped would carry the line into our PS2s, Gamecubes and Xboxes. There&#x27;s still a ton of content and some interesting new features here, but the complex sense of manners and familial intellect were lost on these three red-headed stepchildren.&quot;

=== Handhelds ===
==== Game Boy Advance ====

The Game Boy Advance version of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; takes place in Strangetown, and shares a similar GUI to its predecessors (&quot;The Sims Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; and &quot;The Urbz&quot;). Players are guided through a goal-oriented game based on the reality television concept in which partitions of the game are divided into episodes. Characters from the previous handheld &quot;Sims&quot; games also appeared.

==== Nintendo DS ====

The Nintendo DS version of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; begins with the player&#x27;s car breaking down in Strangetown. Upon arriving, an anonymous donor grants the player the deed to a hotel which can be operated and customized at the player&#x27;s discretion. The player&#x27;s job is to bring life back into Strangetown by encouraging people to come to the hotel, which players can do by upgrading it and making the guests happy. There are several ways in which a player can make Strangetown a nicer place but is up to the player to find them. Unlike most games in the &quot;Sim&quot; series, this one takes place in real-time.

==== PlayStation Portable ====
The PlayStation Portable version of the game is played in third person, much like the Nintendo DS version. The game contains elements of role-playing games and has more of a solid storyline the player is required to navigate through in order to unlock most of the things available in the other versions. The option to build your own home is replaced by a pre-built home where you can customize the furniture and decor. Conversations and jobs are carried out via a mini-game function. The player&#x27;s character does not age, nor are they able to marry or have children, but they can have a significant other and &quot;WooHoo&quot;. Relationships are mainly used for the point of solving goals, although a close friend may move in with the player after progressing in the game. When the player completes a goal their sanity meter, represented as a Plumbob, will fill up slightly and if the player actively does not complete their goals the sanity meter will rapidly deplete until the player is hospitalised or abducted by aliens. The player can also earn &quot;Sanity Points&quot; by completing goals which they can use to unlock special perks. Another feature unique to this and the Nintendo DS version are &quot;Secrets&quot;, which the player can find scattered around Strangetown or by socialising with characters.

The game begins with the player&#x27;s character driving through the Strangetown desert, presumably the &quot;Road to Nowhere&quot; in their car, when suddenly a flying green diamond (also known as the Plumbob, the marker and logo of the Sims games) flies past the player and causes them to lose control of, and damage, their car. Fortunately for the player&#x27;s character, they find a gas station. The player takes their car into the garage, at which point the player takes control. The player is introduced to a vehicle mechanic named Oscar who, after a brief tutorial in teaching the player how to talk to NPC Sims, informs the player their car will only take a short while to fix. The player is then free to roam around the gas station, and after being introduced to some more NPCs, including Bella Goth, who claims to be abducted by aliens, completing tasks and being taught the basic objective of the game which is &quot;Secret Hunting&quot; for the store clerk. The player then exits the shop only to find the garage around the back has completely disappeared along with Oscar and their car, with only the foundation of the garage remaining. The only thing left from the disappearance is a cell phone, which the player answers and a man named Doctor Dominic Newlow offers the player a job, requiring him or her to get a ride into town and find a place to stay. The player informs Police Deputy Duncan about the situation who replies that he can do nothing about it and suggests the player find a place to stay. After having bought Bella&#x27;s house for pocket change and getting donuts for Deputy Duncan (which happen to have been found in the trash), the player finally gets a lift into Strangetown&#x27;s Paradise Place, only to find more tasks and mysteries. In its review, &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;The Sims 2&quot; on PSP plays differently than the PC original and the console versions. Luckily, the differences don&#x27;t make it a bad game at all. On the contrary, these tweaks streamline the experience and spice it up for a mobile audience. And, for those who may be worried, it&#x27;s still very much a &quot;Sims&quot; game. Just different.&quot;

=== Expansion packs ===
&quot;The Sims 2&quot; expansion packs provide additional game features and items. Eight expansion packs were released throughout the game&#x27;s lifecycle. &quot;The Sims 2: Apartment Life&quot; is the final expansion pack for &quot;The Sims 2&quot;.

=== Stuff packs ===
Stuff packs are add-ons that intend to add only new items (usually in the amount of 60) to the base game. Some releases include certain gameplay elements introduced in previous expansion packs. There are ten total stuff packs. &quot;The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack&quot; served as the pilot release for this line of products, which were called &quot;booster packs&quot;. After the success of the pilot release, EA named the releases &quot;stuff packs&quot; and launched the line with &quot;The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff&quot;. &quot;The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff&quot; is the final stuff pack for &quot;The Sims 2&quot;.


=== Core game editions ===
=== Expansion-only compilations ===
Compilations of expansion packs and stuff packs without the core game have been released in 2009 and 2010.

=== Downloadable content ===

==== Pre-order content and The Sims 2 Store ====
Most of expansion packs and stuff packs were released with pre-order items. This game content was redeemable at the official site using a code supplied by the retailer from which the player purchased, each retailer was often associated with an exclusive download. The Sims 2 Store was an online store where players of &quot;The Sims 2&quot; for PC could purchase and download content for their game online for additional fees. It offered objects, clothing, skins, and hairstyles that are both exclusive to the store and also come from earlier expansion and stuff packs. It also had featured seven exclusive item collections that could only be found in the store. The store used a point system that players can purchase. It was opened from July 2008 to March 31, 2011, as a beta version limited to the United States and Canada. To download, players must install &quot;The Sims 2&quot; Store Edition and the EA Download Manager. The exclusive collections were &quot;Cubic&quot;, &quot;Art Deco&quot;, &quot;Spooky&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, &quot;Asian Fusion&quot;, &quot;Art Nouveaulicious&quot;, and &quot;Oh Baby&quot;, including a total of 458 items. Since the closure of The Sims 2 Store on March 31, 2011, &quot;The Sims 2: Store Edition&quot; and the savegame cannot be used with &quot;The Sims 2: Ultimate Collection&quot;.

===Third-party tools===

&quot;SimPE&quot; is an open-source utility for &quot;The Sims 2&quot; that allows editing of Sims&#x27; characteristics, relationships and careers. It also allows the creation of objects. As the tool is intended for use by experienced modders, the &quot;SimPE&quot; interface is not considered intuitive, and users risk corrupting the game files. &quot;TS2 Enhancer&quot;, developed by Rick Halle, is a commercial utility for editing characters and neighborhoods, but has since fallen into disuse.

<doc id="462915" wikidata="Q1333366" url="?curid=462915" title="Snap election">
<text>A snap election is an election that is called earlier than the one that has been scheduled. Snap elections in parliamentary systems are often called to resolve a political impasse such as a hung parliament where no single political party has a majority of seats, when the incumbent prime minister is defeated in a motion of no confidence, to capitalize on an unusual electoral opportunity, or to decide a pressing issue. Snap elections are called under circumstances when an election is not required by law or convention.

A snap election differs from a recall election in that it is initiated by politicians (usually the head of government or ruling party) rather than voters, and from a by-election in that a completely new parliament is chosen as opposed to merely filling vacancies in an already established assembly. Early elections can also be called in certain jurisdictions after a ruling coalition is dissolved if a replacement coalition cannot be formed within a constitutionally set time limit.

Since the power to call snap elections (the dissolution of parliament) usually lies with the incumbent head of government (such as a prime minister), they often result in increased majorities for the party already in power provided they have been called at an advantageous time. However, snap elections can also backfire on the incumbent resulting in a decreased majority or in some cases the opposition winning or gaining power. As a result of the latter cases, there have been occasions in which the consequence has been the implementation of fixed-term elections.

==Americas==

===Belize===
According to Section 84 of the Constitution of Belize, the National Assembly must be dissolved &quot;five years from the date when the two Houses of the former National Assembly first met&quot; unless dissolved sooner by the governor-general upon the advice of the prime minister.

Since Belize gained independence from the United Kingdom in September 1981, snap elections have been called twice, in 1993 and 2012. In March 2015, Belizean Prime Minister Dean Barrow ruled out the possibility of a snap election later in the year. In the November 2015 general election, Prime Minister Barrow&#x27;s United Democratic Party increased its majority by 9 percent as it made Belizean history, forming its third consecutive government.

===Canada===
In Canada, snap elections at the federal level are very common. Section 50 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; and section 4 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; limits the maximum life of a federal parliament to five years following the return of the last writs of election. A law was passed to set the election date on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the previous poll, although courts found it effectively legally unenforceable and not binding on the prime minister. Any election that occurs before the schedule is a snap election.

During his 10 years as prime minister, Jean Chrétien recommended to the governor general to call two snap elections, in 1997 and 2000, winning both times. Wilfrid Laurier and John Turner, meanwhile, both lost their premierships in snap elections they themselves had called (in 1911 and 1984, respectively). The most notable federal snap election is that of 1958, where Prime Minister John Diefenbaker called an election just nine months after the previous one and transformed his minority government into the largest majority in the history of Canada up to that date.

A snap election was also called in the province of Ontario in 1990, three years into Premier David Peterson&#x27;s term. Peterson was polling at 54%, lower than his peak popularity but still well above the opposition party leaders, and expected to be re-elected with comfortable majority. However, the 1990 Ontario general election backfired since it was interpreted as a sign of arrogance, with some cynically viewing it as an attempt to win another mandate before an anticipated economic recession. In the biggest upset in Ontario history, the Ontario New Democratic Party led by Bob Rae won an unprecedented majority government while Peterson lost his own seat to a rookie NDP candidate. A similar result occurred in Alberta in 2015 when Premier Jim Prentice of the governing Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta called a snap election. A few months before, 11 MLAs including their leader from the official opposition Wildrose Party had crossed the floor to sit with the government. However, the province was entering an economic recession due to the abrupt 2010s oil glut, and Prentice&#x27;s budget was not well received by either the political left or right. The resulting Alberta New Democratic Party majority victory unseated 13 cabinet ministers and ended 44 years of Progressive Conservative government in Alberta.

In 2021, sitting Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called a snap election in an attempt to win a majority, up from his previous minority government. He justified the snap election as a way for Canadians to choose which government leads them through Canada&#x27;s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Trudeau was widely criticized for calling the snap election while the country was in the midst of a 4th wave of Covid. Following the election Trudeau managed to remain Prime Minister, but the Liberal Party failed to win a majority government.

===Peru===

The Constitution of Peru allows for the dissolution of Congress by the President if a vote of no-confidence is passed two times by the legislative body, who then has four months to call for new parliamentary elections or faces impeachment. The 2020 Peruvian parliamentary elections were declared after President Martín Vizcarra dissolved Congress.

==Asia and Oceania==

===Australia===
There are three procedures in which federal elections can be held early in Australia:
* The maximum term of the Australian House of Representatives is 3 years. However, the chamber can wait several months after the election to make its first sitting, while a campaign period of at least 33 days is needed between the dates that the election is called and held. It is the norm for the chamber to be dissolved early by the Governor-General before its term expires, which is done on the advice of the Prime Minister.
* Half of the Australian Senate (excluding the seats representing territories) changes over every three years in July. An election for the half about to change over must take place up to a year before this is due, on a date determined by the government. By convention, the elections of both chambers have usually been held on the same day. If the previous Senate election was held close to the changeover, the next Senate election can be held significantly earlier.
* A double dissolution may be called to resolve conflict between the two chambers, in which case the entire membership of both chambers comes up for election. This requires at least one bill that originated in the House of Representatives (often called a &quot;trigger&quot;) to be rejected twice by the Senate under certain conditions. In this case, the next Senate changeover is due in the second month of July after the election, while the House of Representatives begins a new 3-year term.

Examples of early elections in Australia:
* 1963 election: Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies called an early election for the House of Representatives because the government were struggling to govern with their narrow 2-seat majority in the chamber. The government succeeded in gaining 10 seats. The election left the House and Senate elections out of synchronization until 1974.
* 1974 election: The double dissolution election focused on Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam&#x27;s first years in office and whether the Australian public was willing to continue with his reform agenda, and also to break a deadlock in the Senate after Opposition Leader Billy Snedden announced that the opposition would block the Government&#x27;s supply bills in the Senate following the Gair Affair. The Whitlam government was subsequently returned with a reduced majority in the House of Representatives but increased presence (but no majority) in the Senate, allowing the government to pass six reform bills in a joint sitting of the two houses of the Australian parliament.
* 1975 election: The election followed the controversial dismissal of the Whitlam government by Governor-General Sir John Kerr in the 1975 constitutional crisis and the installation of Opposition Leader Malcolm Fraser as prime minister. Labor believed it had a chance of winning the elections, and that the dismissal would be an electoral asset for them but the Coalition attacked Labor for the economic conditions they presided over, resulting in the Coalition winning a record victory, with 91 seats in the House of Representatives to the ALP&#x27;s 36 and a 35–27 majority in the expanded Senate.
* 1983 election: While an election was not due for seven more months, Malcolm Fraser had been emboldened by the unexpected victory in a 1982 by election which his Liberal Party was expected to lose. Fraser also sought to exploit divisions in the opposition Labor Party, and was surprised to learn that the popular Bob Hawke had won the Labor Party leadership on the day he sought a dissolution. Ultimately, Labor won power and defeated the Fraser government on a 24-seat swing—the largest defeat of a sitting government since 1949, and the worst defeat a sitting non-Labor government has ever suffered. 
* 1984 election: This election was held 18 months ahead of time in order to bring the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate back into line. They had been thrown out of balance by the double dissolution of 1983. It was widely expected that the incumbent Hawke Labor government would be easily re-elected, but an exceptionally long 10-week campaign, confusion over the ballot papers and a strong campaign performance by Liberal leader, Andrew Peacock, saw the government&#x27;s majority reduced (although this was disguised by the increase in the size of the House from 125 to 148).
* 1998 election: The election on 3 October 1998 was held six months earlier than required by the Constitution. Prime Minister John Howard made the announcement following the launch of the coalition&#x27;s Goods and Services Tax (GST) policy launch and a five-week advertising campaign. The ensuing election was almost entirely dominated by the proposed 10% GST and proposed income tax cuts.
* 2010 election: A federal election was held on Saturday, 21 August 2010, which was called relatively early in order to give Prime Minister Julia Gillard – who had won the prime ministership outside of an election from Kevin Rudd – a greater mandate. The election ended in a hung parliament, and a resultant retaining of Labor&#x27;s majority in the House of Representatives after negotiations with independents and the Greens.
* 2021 Tasmanian state election: Liberal Premier Peter Gutwein called the election a year early after the Liberal majority government fell into a minority government. The Liberals won the 2021 state election with a majority of one seat, with Labor forming opposition and the crossbench being composed of Greens and independents.
* 2024 Tasmanian state election: Liberal Premier Jeremy Rockliff called the election a year early for the same reason as Gutwein (his predecessor).

In the states and territories, all except Tasmania have fixed election dates legislated into their constitutions or electoral laws and snap elections can only be called in extraordinary circumstances when certain conditions are met (loss of confidence, loss of supply or, in the bicameral legislatures, a deadlocked bill). In Western Australia, the Premier retains the ability to call a snap election at any time despite the fixed election dates. In the Australian Capital Territory, the federal government also has the ability to call a snap election in instances of incapacitation or gross misconduct of the Legislative Assembly. As federal territories constituted under federal legislation, the federal parliament also has the ultimate power to call a snap election in the ACT and the Northern Territory through the normal legislative process, although this has never occurred.

===Bangladesh===
After Khaleda Zia&#x27;s Bangladesh Nationalist Party five-year term ended in January 1996, the country went to the polls on 15 February 1996, where elections were boycotted by all major opposition parties including BNP&#x27;S arch-rival Sheikh Hasina&#x27;s Awami League. The opposition had demanded a neutral caretaker government to oversee the polls, but it was rejected by the incumbent government and the election went on as scheduled. The BNP won by default, grabbing all the 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad and assumed power. The Awami League and its allies did not accept the results and called a month-long general strike and blockades to overthrow the BNP government. The general strike was marred by bloody violence including a grenade attack on Awami League&#x27;s headquarters which killed scores of people. On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh annulled the election results which forced the BNP government to amend the constitution in a special parliamentary session by introducing the Caretaker government system as a part of the electoral reform. Eventually the BNP government was toppled and ousted when they resigned on 31 March 1996, and handed over power to the caretaker government. The caretaker government stayed in power for 90 days before new elections could be held. Finally a snap election was held on 12 June 1996, where Awami-League won a simple majority by beating its bitter rival BNP and stayed in power for the next five years.

===India===
* 1998 general election: General elections were held in India in 1998, after the government elected in 1996 collapsed and the 12th Lok Sabha was convened. New elections were called when Indian National Congress (INC) left the United Front government led by I.K. Gujral, after they refused to drop the regional Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party from the government after the DMK was linked by an investigative panel to Sri Lankan separatists blamed for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. The outcome of the new elections was also indecisive, with no party or alliance able to create a strong majority. Although the Bharatiya Janata Party&#x27;s Atal Bihari Vajpayee regained his position of prime minister getting support from 272 members out of 543, the government collapsed again in late 1998 when the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, with its 18 seats, withdrew their support, leading to new elections in 1999.
* 1999 general election: General elections were held in India from 5 September to 3 October 1999, a few months after the Kargil War. The 13th Lok Sabha election is of historical importance as it was the first time a united front of parties managed to attain a majority and form a government that lasted a full term of five years, thus ending a period of political instability at the national level that had been characterised by three general elections held in as many years.

On 17 April 1999, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) coalition government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee failed a to win a confidence vote in the Lok Sabha (India&#x27;s lower house), falling short a single vote due to the withdrawal of one of the government&#x27;s coalition partners – the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The leader of the AIADMK, J. Jayalalitha, had consistently threatened to withdraw support from the ruling coalition if certain demands were not met, in particular the sacking of the Tamil Nadu government, control of which she had lost three years prior. The BJP accused Jayalalitha of making the demands in order to avoid standing trial for a series of corruption charges, and no agreement between the parties could be reached leading to the government&#x27;s defeat.

Sonia Gandhi, as leader of the opposition and largest opposition party (Indian National Congress) was unable to form a coalition of parties large enough to secure a working majority in the Lok Sabha. Thus shortly after the no confidence motion, President K. R. Narayanan dissolved the Parliament and called fresh elections. Atal Bihari Vajpayee remained caretaker prime minister till the elections were held later that year.

=== Israel ===
After the legislative election in April 2019 resulted in a political stalemate after Yisrael Beiteinu refused to join a Likud-led governing coalition, on the day transitional prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#x27;s mandate for coalition formation ended, the Knesset voted to dissolve itself (preventing president Reuven Rivlin from transferring the mandate for coalition formation to the second-largest party Blue and White&#x27;s leader, Benny Gantz, with respect to the process defined by the law). Thus, a snap legislative election was called, which resulted in a similar stalemate. After both Likud and Blue and White failed to form a coalition, a third consecutive snap election resulted in yet another stalemate. Progress has been made due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and consequently the thirty-fifth government of Israel was formed. However, another snap election was held in 2021 after collapse of the coalition government.

===Japan===
In Japan, a snap election is called when a prime minister dissolves the lower house of the National Diet. The act is based on Article 7 of the Constitution of Japan, which can be interpreted as saying that the prime minister has the power to dissolve the lower house after so advising the Emperor. Almost all general elections of the lower house have been snap elections since 1947, when the current constitution was enacted. The only exception was 1976 election, when the Prime Minister Takeo Miki was isolated within his own Liberal Democratic Party. The majority of LDP politicians opposed Miki&#x27;s decision not to dissolve the lower house until the end of its 4-year term.

=== Kazakhstan ===
Nationally, elections for president and parliament in Kazakhstan are held every seven and five years, respectively. According to the Constitutional Law, the President may call a snap election for both and must held no later than two months respectively after which they are called.

Virtually every presidential election in Kazakhstan since independence had been held ahead of schedule in 1999, 2005, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2022. In which the reasoning behind for consecutive snap elections were due to economic and political factors with allegations for the Kazakh leadership to systemically maintain its grip on power while leaving the opposition consolidated and unprepared.

* 2019 presidential election: Long-time president Nursultan Nazarbayev unexpectedly resigned from office on 19 March 2019, leading for Senate Chairman Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to briefly serve as the acting president until the scheduled 2020 election. From there Tokayev was widely viewed to temporarily serve the remainder of Nazarbayev&#x27;s presidential term as a way to ensure transition of power and hand over the office to Dariga Nazarbayeva, the eldest daughter of Nazarbayev. However, On 9 April 2019, Tokayev initiated a snap presidential election for 9 June 2019 citing the reason of avoiding &quot;political uncertainty&quot; and became Nazarbayev&#x27;s endorsed frontrunner in the race, resulting in him being officially elected to succeed Nazarbayev.

Snap parliamentary elections have also become more frequent in Kazakhstan&#x27;s politics. Originally the 1994 legislative election was held as a result of the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet which previously consisted of former Communist legislators and paved way for a multi-party system. However due to the nature of the newly Supreme Council opposing then-President Nursultan Nazarbayev, it was dissolved a year later and were followed by 1995 legislative elections which saw pro-Nazarbayev candidates being elected as deputies. Snap elections took place in 2007, 2012, and 2016 under the pretext of economic issues.
* 2023 legislative election: After President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev&#x27;s reelection win in November 2022, he called snap elections for the lower chamber Mäjilis for 19 March 2023 under a promise to conclude &quot;a reset and renewal of all major political institutions&quot; following the January Events and 2022 constitutional referendum by promising for a new parliamentary composition to represent the interests of &quot;broad groups of citizens.&quot; The election saw reduced vote share for the ruling Amanat party, resulting in an appearance of various newly formed political factions including independents for the first time since 2004.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand elections must be held every three years, and the date is determined by the prime minister. There have been three snap elections, in 1951, 1984 and 2002.
* The 1951 snap election occurred immediately after the 1951 waterfront dispute, in which the National Party government sided with shipping companies against a militant union, while the Labour opposition equivocated and thus annoyed both sides. The government was returned with an increased majority.
* The 1984 snap election occurred during a term in which the National Party government had a majority of only one seat. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon lost patience with his less obedient MPs and called an election, announcing it on television while visibly drunk. Muldoon&#x27;s government subsequently lost and the Labour Party took power.
* The 2002 election. On 12 June 2002 the Labour Party Prime Minister Helen Clark announced that the country would have a general election on 27 July 2002. Clark claimed that an early poll was necessary due to the collapse of her junior coalition partner, the Alliance, but denied it was a snap election. This early election caused considerable comment. Critics claimed that Clark could have continued to govern, and that the early election was called to take advantage of Labour&#x27;s strong position in the polls. The National Party was caught unprepared by the election and suffered its worst ever result (20.9% of the party vote), and the government was returned with an increased majority.

===Pakistan===
* 1990 general election: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led by Benazir Bhutto won a plurality of seats in the 1988 election and Bhutto became prime minister. However, by 1990 there was discontent over rising lawlessness, allegations of corruption and the failure of the government to fulfill the promises it had made during the 1988 campaign.
* 1993 general election: The Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) won the 1990 election and the party&#x27;s leader, Nawaz Sharif, became prime minister. In early 1993 he attempted to strip the president of the power to dismiss the prime minister, National Assembly and regional assemblies. However, in April 1993 President Khan dismissed Sharif for corruption and called elections for 14 July after dissolving the National Assembly. Sharif immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which in May ruled by 10 to 1 that Khan had exceeded his powers and therefore restored Sharif as prime minister.

Khan and Sharif then began to battle for control of Pakistan for the next two months. They both attempted to secure control over the regional assemblies and in particular, Punjab. In Punjab this saw a staged kidnapping and the moving of 130 members of the Punjab Assembly to the capital to ensure they stayed loyal to Sharif. Meanwhile, the leader of the main opposition party Benazir Bhutto threatened to lead a march on Islamabad unless new elections were called.

Finally on 18 July, under pressure from the army to resolve the power struggle, Sharif and Khan resigned as prime minister and president respectively. Elections for the National Assembly were called for 6 October with elections for the regional assemblies set to follow shortly afterwards.

* 1997 general election: The PPP won the largest number of seats in the 1993 election and Benazir Bhutto became prime minister at the head of a coalition government. However, on 5 November 1996, President Leghari, a former ally of Bhutto, dismissed the government 2 years early for alleged corruption and abuse of power. The allegations included financial mismanagement, failing to stop police killings, destroying judicial independence and violating the constitution. A number of PPP party members were detained including Bhutto&#x27;s husband Asif Ali Zardari who was accused of taking commissions for arranging official deals.

A former speaker and member of the PPP Miraj Khalid was appointed interim prime minister. The National Assembly and provincial assemblies were dissolved and elections called for 3 February 1997. Bhutto denied all the charges against herself and petitioned the Supreme Court to reverse her dismissal. However, the court ruled in January that there was sufficient evidence for the dismissal to be justified legally.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has used the presidential system with fixed terms imposed for more of its history than not. This means that Congress cannot be dissolved, and that &quot;snap elections&quot; as understood under the parliamentary system cannot be invoked. However, during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, the constitution starting from 1973, and first applied in 1978, placed the country under the semi-presidential system of government, where the Batasang Pambansa (parliament) can be dissolved. During the operation of that constitution, the parliament was not dissolved, but Marcos, who had earlier been elected in 1981 for a six-year term, asked Parliament to move the 1987 presidential election to 1986, in response to growing social unrest, political and economic crises, political instability, and deteriorating peace and public order.

In the Philippines, the term &quot;snap election&quot; often refers to the 1986 presidential election. Marcos declared himself the official winner of the election but was eventually ousted when allegations of fraud marred the election. A new constitution approved in 1987 reverted to the presidential system, which made future snap elections unlikely. Fixed presidential elections are held every six years, with legislative elections held every three years.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Previously, During the Dominion of Ceylon, House of Representatives, the Lower House of the Parliament of Ceylon, is elected to a 5 year term. Senate of Ceylon, which is the Upper House, cannot by dissolved. The Prime Minister shall request the Governor-General to dissolve the House of Representatives and call a General Election at a required time. 

* 1956 general election: Even though the elections were not due till 1957, Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala called an early election. The Ruling United National Party led by Kotelawala was defeated to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who became the Prime Minister.
* 1960 March general election: Elections were due on 1961, But Prime Minister Wijayananda Dahanayake dissolved Parliament and called a general election as Ceylon&#x27;s governing Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) coalition was falling apart. United National Party led by Dudley Senanayake obtained a plurality of seats, but without a majority could not form a stable government. This Resulted in a Hung Parliament which eventually led to the 1960 July general election.
* 1960 July general election: As the general election in March resulted in a Hung Parliament, the Parliament was dissolved and a Snap election was held on 20 July 1960, where Sri Lanka Freedom Party led by Sirimavo Bandaranaike formed a Government.

As the Senate of Ceylon was abolished in 1971, The Constitution of 1978, introduced the Executive Presidency and increased the term length of the now Unicameral Parliament to 6 years. The President had the authority to dissolve the Parliament and call a Snap election at a required time.

* 1994 general election: Even though the elections were due in 1995, President D.B. Wijetunga dissolved the Parliament and called a General election in August 1994. Chandrika Kumaratunga of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, became the Prime Minister ending the 17 years of UNP rule in Sri Lanka.
* 2001 general election: 2000 general election lost the majority of the ruling People&#x27;s Alliance but Ratnasiri Wickremanayake continued to be the Prime Minister. Since Several MPs crossed over to the opposition and the Government feared a Motion of No-Confidence, President Kumaratunga dissolved the Parliament and called a general election.
* 2004 general election: 2001 general election resulted in a Cohabitation government where the President and the Prime Minister were from different parties. As the Government was unstable, President Kumaratunga dissolved the Parliament and called a general election 3 1/2 years ahead of schedule.

19th Amendment reduced the maximum term length of the Parliament to 5 years. And the President did not had the authority to dissolve the Parliament and call an Early General Election until the expiration of 4 years and 6 months from the date appointed for its first meeting. In 9 November 2018, As a result of the 2018 Constitutional crisis, President Maithripala Sirisena attempted to dissolve the Parliament and call a general election but the Supreme Court declared this move unconstitutional, which effectively set the election date back to 2020. 

Under the 20th Amendment, The President has the authority to dissolve the Parliament and call an Early General Election after 2 years and 6 months from the date appointed for its first meeting.

* 2024 general election: Even though the elections were not due till August, 2025, Newly Inaugurated President Anura Kumara Dissanayake dissolved Parliament and called a general election roughly 11 months ahead of schedule.

===Thailand===
* 2006 general election: In 2005, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai Party were re-elected for a second consecutive term in office when they won a landslide general election victory by securing 375 out of 500 seats in parliament. This result gave his party the power to amend the constitution since they won a two-thirds majority. However one year later, in 2006, Thaksin was suspected to have been indulging in corrupt business practices in his telecommunication firm &#x27;Shincorp&#x27;. And after several protests orchestrated by the People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy pursuing for the PM&#x27;s resignation, Thaksin called a snap election scheduled for 2 April 2006 where the opposition party supporters boycotted the polls, resulting in over 50% of voters chosen to not cast their ballots. Due to this political demonstration, Thaksin won the snap election and captured all the 500 seats in the house of parliament. Months later, the supreme court annulled the election results and ordered a fresh election to be held within 100 days from the date of the court&#x27;s ruling. However, Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 Thai coup d&#x27;état, forcing him into exile in the Philippines and Dubai. The military stayed in power until 2007 when they stepped down and held a general election in December that year to restore democracy.

* 2014 general election: Thaksin Shinawatra&#x27;s sister Yingluck Shinawatra became Thailand&#x27;s first female prime minister on 3 August 2011 when she won a landslide election victory on 3 July 2011. Later, the government faced a political crisis in November 2013 when her opponents wanted the prime minister and her Pheu Thai Party government to resign after she tried to pass a controversial amnesty bill in parliament which would permit the return of her brother Thaksin as a free man. However, the bill was not passed because the government succumbed to pressure from weeks of street protests and blockades that took place in Bangkok, which intensified before the King&#x27;s birthday. On 9 December 2013, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra decided to dissolve parliament and called a snap general election, which was held on 2 February 2014. This announcement came a day after the resignation of all MPs from the main opposition Democrat Party led by opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva, which boycotted the election afterwards.

===Armenia===
Snap parliamentary elections were held in Armenia on 9 December 2018, as none of the parties in the National Assembly were able to put forward and then elect a candidate for prime minister in the two-week period following the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. They were the first elections following the 2018 revolution and the country&#x27;s first-ever snap elections.

===Belgium===

Snap elections are possible for the Federal Parliament of Belgium, but not for the regional parliaments. The last snap election was held in 2010.

Technically, usually the federal parliament is dissolved by means of a Declaration of Revision of the Constitution (automatically triggering an election), just before the normal expiration of the legislative period.

===Bulgaria===

Snap elections were held in 2014 when neither the Bulgarian Socialist Party nor GERB were able to form a coalition with a tied parliament.

After the 2020–2021 Bulgarian protests there has been a political stalemate which has led to snap elections in July 2021, November 2021, 2022 (after the Petkov Government fell) and 2023, with another snap election called for June 2024, after the fall of the Denkov Government.

===Czech Republic===
Snap general elections were held in the Czech Republic on 25 and 26 October 2013, seven months before the constitutional expiry of the elected parliament&#x27;s four year legislative term.

The government elected in May 2010 led by Prime Minister Petr Nečas was forced to resign on 17 June 2013, after a corruption and bribery scandal. A caretaker government led by Prime Minister Jiří Rusnok was then appointed by the President, but narrowly lost a vote of confidence on 7 August, leading to its resignation six days later. The Chamber of Deputies then passed a motion dissolving itself on 20 August, with a call for new elections within 60 days after presidential assent. The President gave his assent on 28 August, scheduling the elections for 25 and 26 October 2013.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, Parliamentary elections take place every fourth year (Danish Constitution art. 32, sec. 1); however, the prime minister can choose to call an early election at any time, provided that any elected parliament has already been called into session at least once (Danish Constitution art. 32, sec. 2). If a government loses its majority in the Folketing, this is not automatically a vote of confidence, but such a vote may be called, and – if lost – the government calls a new election. Denmark has a history of coalition minority governments, and due to this system, a party normally providing parliamentary support for the sitting government while not being part of it, can choose to deprive the government of a parliamentary majority regarding a specific vote, but at the same time avoid calling new elections since any vote of no confidence takes place as a separate procedure.

Notably, Denmark faced a number of very short parliaments in the 1970s and the 1980s. Prime Minister Poul Schlüter lead a series of coalition minority governments calling elections in both 1984, 1987, 1988 and 1990. Likewise, his predecessors called elections in 1971, 1973, 1975, 1977, 1979 and 1981. For more than 40 years, no Danish parliament has sat its full four-year term, although Lars Løkke II and Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet came very close in 2019, in all cases, the prime minister has called elections at an earlier date.

*2007 general election: Prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced an election date for 24 October 2007. The election was held ahead of time in the sense that by law, the election needed to be held before 8 February 2009, four years after the previous election. Anders Fogh Rasmussen explained that the elections were called early in order to allow the parliament to work on important upcoming topics without being distracted by a future election. Referring specifically to welfare reform, he said rival parties would then try to outdo each other with expensive reforms which would damage the Danish economy.
*2022 general election: Prime minister Mette Frederiksen announced an election date for 1 November 2022. The elections were called on 5 October following an ultimatum to the government by the Social Liberals (which had been providing external support) due to the outcome of a report on the 2020 Danish mink cull by the Mink Commission, which was critical of the government.

===Finland===
The President of Finland can call for an early election. As per the version of the 2000 constitution currently in use, the president can do this only upon proposal by the prime minister and after consultations with the parliamentary groups, while the Parliament is in session. In prior versions of the constitution, the President had the power to do this unilaterally.

===France===
In France, under the Fifth Republic, while the National Assembly is elected for a five-year term, the President has the authority to dissolve the National Assembly and call an early election, provided the Assembly has not been dissolved in the preceding twelve months. When the presidential term of office was shortened from seven to five years in the 2000 French constitutional referendum, presidential terms became equal in length to legislative terms. Until a snap 2024 legislative election was called, presidential and parliamentary terms were synchronized, with the National Assembly elected a few weeks after the president, reducing the risk of a cohabitation. The Senate, which is the upper house, can never be dissolved prematurely.
* 1968 legislative election: The then-president Charles de Gaulle called a snap election after May protests.
* 1988 legislative election: After the re-election of François Mitterrand in that year&#x27;s presidential election, a snap parliamentary election was called to try and create a parliamentary majority for Mitterrand in order to end the cohabitation government. While his allies obtained a plurality of seats, a coalition government needed to be formed. A similar dissolution occurred in 1981 after Mitterrand&#x27;s first election.
* 1997 legislative election: The then-president Jacques Chirac called an election one year before it was scheduled to take place in an effort to catch the left-wing parties off guard. Partly due to the unpopularity of the prime minister, Alain Juppé, a coalition of left-wing parties were able to form a government, resulting in the longest cohabitation period in modern French history. This also marks the only time a French president has lost an election he called on his own initiative since the start of the Fifth Republic (1958).
* 2024 legislative election: President Emmanuel Macron called a snap election in response to the European Parliament elections, when Macron&#x27;s party Renaissance took heavy losses and the far-right populist National Rally got 31.5% of the vote.

===Germany===
In the Federal Republic of Germany, elections to the Bundestag must take place within 46–48 months (every four years) after the first sitting of the previous chamber. The Federal President may only dissolve the chamber prematurely if the government loses a confidence motion (at the request of the Chancellor), or if no majority government can be formed.
* 1972 federal election: after the 1969, the second placed Social Democratic Party and the small Free Democratic Party had formed a social-liberal coalition with a relatively narrow 20-seat majority. Due to Chancellor Willy Brandt&#x27;s &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; foreign policy, especially the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line, the government then lost their majority after several MPs defected to the CDU/CSU opposition. On 27 April 1972 the opposition tried to have CDU leader Rainer Barzel elected new chancellor in a motion of no confidence, but Barzel surprisingly missed the majority in the Bundestag by two votes. A snap election was held after the 1972 Olympics in Munich. Benefitting from Brandt&#x27;s personal popularity and modern interior policies, his SPD became the strongest party for the first time, with 45.8%
* 1983 federal election: The government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt had been ousted in October 1982 after the FDP had switched from being allied with the SPD to being allied with the CDU-CSU union. Although the majority of MPs now supported the government of the new Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he wanted an early election in order to gain an explicit mandate to govern. To do this, he deliberately lost a confidence motion by asking for his coalition MPs to abstain. There was some controversy over this fake move and the decision was challenged in the Constitutional Court, but given approval by President Carstens. Kohl&#x27;s government won the election with a net loss of one seat despite FDP losses. In addition, a new party, the Greens, first entered the parliament, weakening the SPD. 
* 2005 federal election: in 1998 Gerhard Schröder (SPD) had won over Kohl (CDU), but already in 2002, the major parties were deadlocked at 38.5% each, and with the Greens being the larger of the minor parties, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder could carry on with his SPD-Green coalition for some time. After a series of state election losses, culminating with North Rhine-Westphalia in 2005, caused the opposition to gain a wide majority in the Bundesrat, the second chamber, Schröder deliberately lost a confidence motion to trigger new elections. His red-green coalition government also feared that left-wing SPD MPs were threatening to block Agenda 2010 reform legislation. As with the 1983 dissolution, it was challenged and upheld in the Federal Constitutional Court. The election produced a hung parliament due to the gains made by a fifth force, The Left party of former East Germany, resulting in a grand coalition being formed between the CDU-CSU and SPD. Schröder lost his chancellorship to Angela Merkel due to his party narrowly coming second in the elections.

In most German states, the parliament is able to dissolve itself. This explains why there have been many more snap elections, actual, intended, or cancelled, in German states compared to the federal level, for example:
* Hamburg: The Bürgerschaft elections of December 1982, 1987, 1993, 2004, and 2011.
* Berlin: The Abgeordnetenhaus elections of 1950, 1981, 1990, and 2001.
* Hesse: The Landtag election of 2009.
* Schleswig-Holstein: The Landtag elections of 1988, with 2009 and 2012 being two snap elections in a row, after the grand coalition of 2005 had collapsed in mid 2009. Due to ambiguity and complications with the electoral law, the 2009 election result was the subject of a legal challenge by the Greens, The Left, and the Danish minority party SSW. In August 2010, the state Constitutional Court ruled that the electoral law was unconstitutional. The court mandated that a new electoral law be legislated within six months and that new elections be held by September 2012, two years ahead of schedule.
* Thuringia: no snap elections after gains for the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the 2019 Thuringian state election caused a hung parliament and the 2020 Thuringian government crisis. Snap elections were scheduled for April 25, 2021, then postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic to align with the 2021 German federal election on September 26, but the idea was abandoned in July 2021 to carry on with the minority government led by Minister-President Bodo Ramelow of The Left. The regular 2024 Thuringian state election resulted in another hung parliament, as the AfD became largest party for the first time in Germany and the new BSW established itself in third place after splitting off from The Left. Two of the three federal traffic light coalition parties, FDP and Greens, were eliminated from presence in the Thuringian parliament altogether, while the SPD, the party of reigning German Chancellor Scholz, came close to elimination with only 6.1%.

===Greece===
In 2012, Greece held snap elections in two consecutive months. The government of George Papandreou, elected in the 2009 legislative election, had resigned in November 2011. Instead of triggering an immediate snap election, the government was replaced by a national unity government which had a remit to ratify and implement decisions taken with other Eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) a month earlier. This government served for six months.

The May 2012 legislative election produced a deadlocked parliament and attempts to form a government were unsuccessful. The constitution directs the president to dissolve a newly elected parliament that is unable to form a government. Ten days after the election, the president announced that a second election would be held. The June 2012 legislative election resulted in the formation of a coalition government.

In 2015, after the bailout referendum, in which the proposed bailout program was rejected with a 61.31% majority, the Syriza government accepted the program, relying on votes from the opposition parties New Democracy, PASOK and The River. Since many Syriza MPs refused to support the government, new elections were called for 20 September of the same year, 8 months after the previous ones.

* May 2023 Greek legislative election
* June 2023 Greek legislative election

===Italy===
In Italy, national snap elections have been quite frequent in modern history, both under the Monarchy and in the current republican phase. After the foundation of the Italian Republic in 1946, the first snap election occurred in 1972 and the latest one in 2022. After significant changes in the election system (in 1992–1993), the frequency of snap elections has been slightly reduced since new regulations granted completion of two of four parliamentary terms. Nonetheless, snap elections still play a role in the political debate as tools considered by political parties and the Executive branch to promote their agenda or to seize political momentum. No recall election is codified in electoral regulations.
The Italian President is not required to call for a snap election, even if the prime minister asks for it, provided that the Parliament is able to form a new working majority (President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro denied snap election to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi after the loss of confidence in 1994).

===Luxembourg===
Early general elections were held in Luxembourg on 20 October 2013. The elections were called after Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, at the time the longest serving head of government in the European Union, announced his resignation over a spy scandal involving the Service de Renseignement de l&#x27;Etat (SREL). The review found Juncker deficient in his control over the service.

After a spy scandal involving the SREL illegally wiretapping politicians, the Grand Duke and his family, and allegations of paying for favours in exchange for access to government ministers and officials leaked through the press, Prime Minister Juncker submitted his resignation to the Grand Duke on 11 July 2013, upon knowledge of the withdrawal of the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party from the government and thereby losing its confidence and supply in the Chamber of Deputies. Juncker urged the Grand Duke for the immediate dissolution of parliament and the calling of a snap election.

===Romania===
In Romania, under the 1993 constitution, according the article 89, the President of Romania can dissolve the Parliament of Romania if a government has not been formed in 60 days and two proposals for Prime Minister have been refused.

===Russia===
In Russia, under the 1993 constitution, according the article 109, while the State Duma (lower house of the Federal Assembly) is elected for a five-year term, but the president has the authority to dissolve the State Duma and call a snap election. However, this possibility of the president is limited, and he can use it only in two cases: if the State Duma three times in a row refused to approve the prime minister, or twice in three months pass a motion of no confidence against the Government of Russia.

*2016 legislative election &quot;de facto&quot; were snap, as they were held three months ahead of schedule. However, the early holding of election was not due to the dissolution of the State Duma, but to the postponement of the day of voting on the day on which the regional elections were held. The early elections were approved by the Constitutional Court.

===Slovakia===
A snap general election took place in Slovakia on 10 March 2012 to elect 150 members of the &quot;Národná rada&quot;. The election followed the fall of Prime Minister Iveta Radičová&#x27;s Slovak Democratic and Christian Union – Democratic Party-led coalition in October 2011 over a no confidence vote her government had lost because of its support for the European Financial Stability Fund. Amidst a major corruption scandal involving local center-right politicians, former Prime Minister Robert Fico&#x27;s Direction – Social Democracy won an absolute majority of seats.

===Slovenia===
A parliamentary election for the 90 deputies to the National Assembly of Slovenia was held on 4 December 2011. This was the first early election in Slovenia&#x27;s history. 65.60% of voters cast their vote. The election was surprisingly won by the center-left Positive Slovenia party, led by Zoran Janković. However, he failed to be elected as the new prime minister in the National Assembly, and the new government was formed by a right-leaning coalition of five parties, led by Janez Janša, the president of the second-placed Slovenian Democratic Party.
the National Assembly consists of 90 members, elected for a four-year term, 88 members elected by the party-list proportional representation system with D&#x27;Hondt method and 2 members elected by ethnic minorities (Italians and Hungarians) using the Borda count.

The election was previously scheduled to take place in 2012, four years after the 2008 election. However, on 20 September 2011, the government led by Borut Pahor fell after a vote of no confidence.

As stated in the Constitution, the National Assembly has to elect a new prime minister within 30 days and a candidate has to be proposed by either members of the Assembly or the President of the country within seven days after the fall of a government. If this does not happen, the president dissolves the Assembly and calls for a snap election. The leaders of most parliamentary political parties expressed opinion that they preferred an early election instead of forming a new government.

As no candidates were proposed by the deadline, the President Danilo Türk announced that he would dissolve the Assembly on 21 October and that the election would take place on 4 December. The question arose as to whether the President could dissolve the Assembly after the seven days, in the event that no candidate was proposed. However, since this situation is not covered in the constitution, the decision of the President to wait the full 30 days was welcomed by the political parties. The dissolution of the Assembly, a first in independent Slovenia, took place on October 21, a minute after midnight.

===Spain===
*2011 general election: The Cortes Generales were dissolved and the general election called by King Juan Carlos I on 26 September, at the request of Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who had already announced his intention to call for a snap election on 28 July.
*2016 general election: After no party secured a majority in the 2015 general election and with ensuing negotiations leading to political deadlock, a fresh election was called for 26 June—the first time in Spanish recent history that an election was triggered as a result of failure in the government formation process.
*2023 general election. A general election was originally due to take place in December 2023. However, after losing majorities in many regional parliaments and local councils in the 28 May 2023 local elections, Prime minister Pedro Sánchez announced a snap election to be held on 23 July. 

===Sweden===
The Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen) in the Constitution of Sweden allows an &quot;extra election&quot; (&quot;extra val&quot; in Swedish). The wording is used to make clear it does not change the period to the next ordinary election, and the Members of Parliament elected merely serve out what remains of the four-year parliamentary term. This has however not occurred since 1958. 

Elections are called by the government. Elections are also to be held if the parliament fails four times to elect a prime minister.
Elections may not otherwise be called during the first three months of the Riksdag&#x27;s first session after a general election. Elections may not be called by a prime minister who has resigned or been discharged. 
* 2014 Swedish government crisis: On 3 December 2014, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven announced that the government was calling for a snap election on 22 March 2015, after the parliament elected on 14 September 2014 voted against the government&#x27;s proposal for the 2015 state budget. However, the final order of the snap election was never carried out as six out of the eight parliament parties reached an agreement on 27 December 2014 called &quot;Decemberöverenskommelsen&quot; (The December Agreement). The agreement was dissolved in 2015.

===Switzerland===
Following a total revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution, both chambers of the Federal Assembly must be newly elected. Otherwise, early elections are not intended. This being the case because the Swiss political system does not rely on stable coalitions as its government, the Federal Council, acts independently from the Assembly and bills voted on by parliament are dealt on a case-by-case basis.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine a snap poll must have a voter turnout higher than 50%. A snap election was most recently held with the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election held after President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dissolved the Verkhovna Rada shortly after his inauguration to win a parliamentary majority for his Servant of the People party. 

===United Kingdom===
The prime minister of the United Kingdom has the &quot;de facto&quot; power to call an election at will by requesting a dissolution from the monarch; the limited circumstances where this would not be granted are set out in the Lascelles Principles. If this does not happen, parliament dissolves automatically after five years, but this never happens; so in effect, most elections since the length of parliament was first limited in 1694, except the one in 2015 (the date for which was fixed by law), have technically been snap elections. The term is thus normally reserved in the British context for elections called significantly earlier than required (after five years since 1911, or after seven years prior to that).

==== Fixed-term Parliaments Act ====
From 2011 to 2022, the conditions for when a snap election could be called were significantly restricted by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (FTPA) to occasions when the government loses a confidence motion or when a two-thirds supermajority of MPs vote in favour. During autumn 2019 there were three attempts to trigger an election through the FTPA&#x27;s provision for a two-thirds majority: all failed. Then the FTPA was bypassed entirely by Parliament enacting the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 stipulating a set date for the next election: the 2019 general election. This required only a simple majority, because of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy: Parliament cannot pass a law that cannot be changed or reversed by a future Parliament. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act was repealed on March 24, 2022 by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, which restored the Monarch&#x27;s power to dissolve parliament on request by the Prime Minister. This is thought to have revived the Lascelles Principles as well.

==== History ====
The following elections were called by a voluntary decision of the government less than four years after the previous election:
*1923 general election: Although the Conservative Party had won a working majority in the House of Commons after Bonar Law&#x27;s victory in the 1922 general election, Stanley Baldwin called an election only a year later. Baldwin sought a mandate to raise tariffs, which Law had promised against in the previous election, as well as desiring to gain a personal mandate to govern and strengthen his position within the party. This backfired, as the election resulted in a hung parliament. Following losing a confidence motion in January 1924, Baldwin resigned and was replaced by Ramsay MacDonald, who formed the country&#x27;s first ever Labour minority government with tacit support from the Liberal Party.
*1931 general election: Following his government split over how to deal with the Great Depression, Ramsay MacDonald offered his resignation to the King in August 1931. He was instead persuaded to form a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals, which resulted in his expulsion from the Labour Party. The Cabinet then decided to call the election to obtain a Doctor&#x27;s Mandate to fix the economy. The result was that the National Government won the biggest landslide in British history. Labour, which was blamed for running away from responsibility as a Government in the nation&#x27;s hour of need, was reduced to just 52 seats and its leader, Arthur Henderson, lost his seat.
*1951 general election: Despite the fact the Conservatives were leading in the polls, Clement Attlee called the election to increase his government&#x27;s majority, which had been reduced to just five seats in the previous general election. The Labour Party was defeated and Winston Churchill returned to power with a majority of 17.
*1955 general election: After Winston Churchill retired in April 1955, Anthony Eden took over and immediately called the election in order to gain a mandate for his government.
*1966 general election: Harold Wilson called the election seventeen months after Labour narrowly won the 1964 general election: The government had won a barely-workable majority of four seats, which had been reduced to two following the Leyton by-election in January 1965. Labour won a decisive victory, with a majority of 98 seats.
*February 1974 general election: Prime Minister Edward Heath called the election in order to get a mandate to face down a miners&#x27; strike. The election unexpectedly produced a hung parliament in which Labour narrowly won more seats, despite winning fewer votes than the Conservatives. Unable to form a coalition with the Liberals, Heath resigned and was replaced by Wilson.
*October 1974 general election: Six months following the February election, Wilson called another general election in an attempt to win a majority for his Labour minority government and resolve the deadlock. Wilson was successful, though Labour only held a narrow 3-seat majority.

Gordon Brown came very close to calling a snap election in the autumn of 2007; after he failed to do this, his popularity and authority greatly declined and he lost power in 2010.
The following elections were forced by a motion of no confidence against the will of the government:
*1924 general election: Ramsay MacDonald was forced to call the election after a successful vote of no confidence as a result of the Campbell Case. It was the third general election in three years. The result was a landslide victory for Baldwin and the Conservatives.
*1979 general election: This election was held six months before the latest possible date. It was called when the minority Labour government of James Callaghan lost a confidence motion, which had been proposed by the SNP in the aftermath of the Scottish devolution referendum and was taken forward by the Conservatives, by one vote. The Conservatives, led by Margaret Thatcher, won a majority of seats at the election.

The following two elections were called by the will of Parliament while the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 was in force:
*2017 general election: In April 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May tabled a motion in the House of Commons for an early general election in the form detailed in section 2(2) of the 2011 Act, which was approved in Parliament by a near-unanimous vote. This was shortly after the official commencement of the process of withdrawing from the European Union (Brexit), with May saying that she needed a clear mandate to lead the country through the ensuing negotiations, and hoping to increase her Conservative Party&#x27;s majority. The election was a failure for May, with the Conservative Party losing seats, resulting in a hung parliament and a minority Conservative government with a confidence and supply agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party.
*2019 general election: In September and October 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, seeking a mandate and a majority to break the parliamentary deadlock on his Brexit deal, failed on several occasions to pass a section 2(2) motion for an early general election due to its requirement for a two-thirds majority. After failing to force the deal through with minimal scrutiny via a long prorogation that was ruled unlawful, he introduced a bill to bypass the 2011 Act, requiring only a simple majority in both houses. The bill passed and the Conservatives gained an 80 seat majority in the subsequent election, allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union the following January.

====Devolved governments====
The devolved UK administrations (the Northern Ireland Assembly, Scottish Parliament, and the Senedd; established in 1998, 1999, and 1998 respectively) are also elected for fixed terms of government (four years prior to 2011, five years thereafter), but snap elections can still be called in the event of a motion of no confidence, or other special circumstances.
*2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election: Held ten months after the previous Assembly election. Following the resignation of Sinn Féin deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness over various issues and scandals with his party&#x27;s DUP coalition partners, and the subsequent refusal of Sinn Féin to nominate a new deputy First Minister, the Northern Ireland Executive collapsed and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire was legally obliged to call a snap election to attempt to restore a functional devolved government. This election took place on 2 March 2017. The DUP and Sinn Féin remained the two largest parties following the election, but did not reach an agreement to share power until January 2020.

<doc id="462920" wikidata="Q12061403" url="?curid=462920" title="Lustron house">
<text>Lustron houses are prefabricated enameled steel houses developed in the post-World War II era United States in response to the shortage of homes for returning G.I.s by Chicago industrialist and inventor Carl Strandlund. Considered low-maintenance and extremely durable, they were expected to attract modern families who might not have the time for, or interest in, repairing and painting conventional wood and plaster houses. Lustron production ceased in 1950 due to the company&#x27;s inability to pay back the startup loans it had received from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Over 2,000 homes were constructed during the Lustron&#x27;s brief production period, and many remain in use today. Several have been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Development==
In January 1947, the newly formed Lustron Corporation announced that it had received a $12.5-million Reconstruction Finance Corporation loan to manufacture mass-produced prefabricated homes that featured vitreous enamel-coated steel panels (). Led by Chicago industrialist and inventor Carl Strandlund, who had worked with constructing prefabricated gas stations, Lustron offered a home that would &quot;defy weather, wear, and time.&quot;

Strandlund&#x27;s Lustron Corporation, a division of the Chicago Vitreous Enamel Corporation, set out to construct 15,000 homes in 1947 and 30,000 in 1948. From its plant in Columbus, Ohio (the former Curtiss-Wright factory), the corporation eventually constructed 2,498 Lustron homes between 1948 and 1950. The houses sold for between $8,500 and $9,500, according to a March 1949 article in the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot;—about 25 percent less than comparable conventional housing. By November 1949, however, a Lustron&#x27;s average selling price had come up to $10,500.

Most of the known Lustron houses were constructed in 36 of the United States, including Alaska. However, some were constructed in Venezuela for families of oil industry employees.

Billed as a way to maximize pleasure and minimize work, Lustron advertising contended that the Lustron home would create a &quot;new and richer experience for the entire family,&quot; where &quot;Mother...has far more hours,&quot; the &quot;youngsters...have fewer worries,&quot; and there would be &quot;far more leisure for Dad.&quot; How this would be accomplished with just a choice of housing was not clarified, although presumably, it was through enameled-steel design that would not need painting.

The Lustron design was created to adapt it to mass production. A steel framing system was devised consisting of vertical steel studs and roof-ceiling trusses to which all interior and exterior panels were attached. The concept of prefabricated housing was well established by firms such as The Aladdin Company, Gordon-Van Tine Company, Montgomery Ward, and Sears in the early 1900s. These companies, however, used conventional balloon-framing techniques and materials in their kits. After World War II, the domestic demand for steel exceeded production and the federal government exercised control over its allocation. Strandlund had orders for his porcelain-enameled panels for use in construction for new gas stations for Standard Oil. He made a request for allocation of steel but was denied. However, he was advised by Wilson W. Wyatt, Housing Expediter during the Truman administration, that steel would be available if Strandlund produced steel houses instead of gas stations.

Wyatt endorsed the idea but was unable to convince Congressional members to appropriate funds for Strandlund. In turn, Wyatt resigned his post, but other influential members of Congress were successful in getting support to finance the production of Lustron homes. Through the government agency, Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), Strandlund ultimately received over $37 million in loans plus a leased war surplus plant in Columbus, Ohio. This was the first venture capital loan made by the federal government. Initially, Strandlund was provided the availability of a war surplus plant in Chicago.
However, due to the political intrigue in government, Preston Tucker, who proposed to produce a radical new automobile, acquired the plant. In turn, Tucker shortly failed in his business operation. The political ramifications are as fascinating as the engineering of the Lustron homes.
The Lustron factory had approximately eight miles of automated conveyor lines and included 11 enameling furnaces, each of which was more than 180 feet long. The plant equipment included presses for tubs and sinks. The bathtub press could stamp a tub in one draw and could produce 1000 tubs a day at capacity. Specially designed trailer trucks were used as the final assembling point where the manufactured parts came off the assembly line. There were approximately 3300 individual parts in a complete house loaded on a single trailer. The trucks then delivered the house package to the building site.

Lustron established builder-dealers, which in turn sold and erected the house package on a concrete foundation. In 20 months of production and sales, Lustron lost money on each house, and in turn, was not able to repay the RFC loan. RFC foreclosed on Lustron and production stopped on June 6, 1950. On the Lustron order book were contracts for more than 8000 housing units, which were never shipped.

==Models==
Arguably the most popular of the Lustron homes was the two bedroom, &quot;Westchester Deluxe&quot; model. In total, there were three &quot;models&quot; of Lustrons: the Westchester, Newport, and Meadowbrook. With the exception of the Esquire (which had been the prototype&#x27;s name) each Lustron type was available as either a two- or three-bedroom model.

===Model comparison===
==Design features==

Prefabricated housing had existed before the Lustron home came on the market. However, it was Lustron&#x27;s promises of assembly-line efficiency and modular construction that set it apart from its competitors. The homes were designed by Morris Beckman of Chicago firm Beckman and Blass and may have been loosely based on designs for the Cemesto houses in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. With enameled steel panels inside and out, as well as steel framing, the homes stood out next to more traditional dwellings made of wood and plaster.

Lustron homes were usually built on concrete slab foundations with no basement. However, about 40 Lustron homes have been reported to have basements. Their sturdy steel frame was constructed on-site and the house was assembled piece-by-piece from a special Lustron Corporation delivery truck. The assembly team, who worked for the local Lustron builder-dealer, followed a special manual from Lustron and were supposed to complete a house in 360 man-hours.

===Color options===
The Ohio History Connection recognizes four exterior colors: &quot;Surf Blue,&quot; &quot;Dove Gray,&quot; &quot;Maize Yellow,&quot; and &quot;Desert Tan.&quot; Reported in error over the years is that Blue-Green, Green, Pink, and White were available. Window surrounds were primarily ivory-colored, although early models used yellow trim on &quot;Surf Blue&quot; models.

===Interiors===
The interiors were designed with an eye toward the modern age, space-saving, and ease of cleaning. All Lustrons had metal-paneled interior walls that were most often gray. To maximize space, all interior rooms and closets featured pocket doors. All models featured metal cabinetry, a service and storage area, and metal ceiling tiles. In the Westchester Deluxe models, the living room and master bedrooms featured built-in wall units. As an added option, customers were presented with the unique Thor-brand combination clothes- and dish-washer, which incorporated the kitchen sink.

===Window types===
There were two major window types in Lustron homes: “tripartite” and casement, all manufactured by Reynolds Aluminum. The tripartite consisted of a central light flanked by two four-light casement windows. Three-light and/or square aluminum casements with interior screens were standard on all Lustrons. Add-on storm windows were available for residents in colder climates.

Westchester Deluxe two- and three-bedroom models were unique in that they boasted a tripartite bay window in the living room area: no other Lustron line included this feature. In Westchester Deluxe two-bedroom models, additional tripartite windows were located in the dining area and bedrooms. For Westchester Deluxe three-bedroom models, tripartite windows were found in the dining area and two of the bedrooms, as well as the living room bay. Though the Westchester Standard line had no bay windows, it had tripartite windows in the same rooms as the Westchester Deluxe two-bedroom model.

Newport two- and three-bedroom models, which had no bay windows, offered tripartite windows in the dining/living room area. A model of the Meadowbrook home shows that the design would have provided two tripartite windows, both in the dining/living room area, similar to those in the Newport line.

===Roof, flooring, and other details===

The roof likewise consisted of porcelain-enameled steel tiles, which were installed shingle-style. The front and rear doors featured a single light of translucent, rippled glass. As seen in the chart above, floors in the Westchester Deluxe models were asphalt tile, but in other models (Westchester Standard, Newport, and Meadowbrook), floors were installed as a “builder&#x27;s option.”

===Temperature control===
In most models, the homes were heated with an oil burning furnace that directed hot air into an enclosed space above the metal ceilings. The walls contained a one-inch blanket of fiberglass wool insulation. Later production models of the Newport use a forced-air system.

===Identifying marks===
Among noteworthy Lustron exterior features are the siding consisting of square segments of material, followed by a zig-zag downspout trellis on the buildings&#x27; front and rear corners. In the two-bedroom Westchester models, the downspout attaches via the trellis to a pillar that supports the open porch. Rust has often led to removal of the trellis by owners.

==End of the Lustron Corporation==
The Lustron Corporation declared bankruptcy in 1950, despite it being an extremely well funded, well-publicized, government-supported enterprise manufacturing a desperately needed product. Production delays, the lack of a viable distribution strategy, and the escalating prices for the finished product all contributed to the failure. Additionally, local zoning codes also played a part. In some municipalities, for example, an ordinance prohibited homes with steel chimneys. Some accounts suggest an organized effort from the existing housing industry to stop Strandlund, comparing him to Preston Tucker (ironic, because Strandlund&#x27;s first choice for the Lustron factory building, the Dodge Chicago Aircraft Engine Plant in Illinois, was actually granted to Tucker to build his automobiles).

==Lustrons on a Marine base==
The largest assembly of Lustrons in one geographic location was in Quantico, Virginia, where 60 were installed at the U.S. Marine Corps military base. All Westchester Deluxe models, they came in all four colors. Major remodels in the 1980s resulted in some of them being painted pink and lime green. In January 2006, it was announced that the homes, which had grown &quot;too small for most families,&quot; would be eliminated from base housing and would be given away. Fifty-eight of Quantico&#x27;s Lustrons were offered for free (with an application and $8,000 deposit) in 2006, yet only one individual came forward and acquired a home, which was disassembled and moved to storage in Delaware. Twenty-three of Quantico&#x27;s Lustrons were demolished in 2006, and an additional thirty-four homes were razed in 2007. The two remaining homes at the base are on the National Register of Historic Places, and are currently used as maintenance buildings.

==Preservation==
About 1,500 Lustron homes are still in existence in 36 states. Many have been modified with additions, remodeled kitchens, vinyl windows, composite roofs, new heating systems, sheet rock interior walls, painted exteriors, and siding. Some have been dismantled, relocated and reassembled.

A restored Westchester Deluxe (sans ceiling and roof) from Arlington, Virginia, was reassembled inside the Ohio History Connection in Columbus, Ohio, in 2013. It had been partially assembled (no bedrooms) for a few months in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan. The house continues to be on display in Columbus through 2024 at least.

A small group of Lustron owners are preserving the original condition of their homes and are urging others to do the same, and a significant number of entirely original Lustron homes exist. Over time, Lustron owners often removed the &quot;Thor&quot; brand combination washing machine/dish washer, and in cold regions, the ceiling&#x27;s radiant heat systems were often replaced.

===Threats===
Demolition continues to threaten Lustrons where rising property values attract buyers who desire larger homes of newer construction. Other major threats to Lustron homes&#x27; integrity include: severe weather (tornadoes, hurricanes), vehicular or other impact, and lack of local zoning/preservation/aesthetic legislation.

==Current status==

Many Lustron houses remain, some as individual or contributing properties to the National Register of Historic Places. The Lustron Houses of Jermain Street Historic District is a notable grouping and historic district in New York state.

<text>No. 206 Squadron is a Test and Evaluation Squadron of the Royal Air Force. Until 2005 it was employed in the maritime patrol role with the Nimrod MR.2 at RAF Kinloss, Moray. It was announced in December 2004 that 206 Squadron would disband on 1 April 2005, with half of its crews being redistributed to Nos. 120 and 201 Squadrons, also stationed at Kinloss. This was a part of the UK Defence Review called &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;; the Nimrod MR.2 fleet was reduced in number from 21 to 16 as a consequence.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
No. 206 Squadron was formed on 31 December 1916 as No. 6 Squadron, Royal Naval Air Service, a fighter unit operating Nieuport 17s and later Sopwith Camels over the Western Front before disbanding on 27 August 1917. The squadron was reformed on 1 January 1918 as a bomber and reconnaissance unit, operating Airco DH9s. With the establishment of the RAF in 1918 the squadron was renumbered No. 206 Squadron, RAF, being used for photo-reconnaissance in support of the British Second Army and for bombing support during the Allies final offensive. Following the Armistice it was used to operate an air mail service for the British occupying army in Germany, before being deployed to Helwan, Egypt in June 1919. It was renumbered as 47 Squadron on 1 February 1920.

Flying ace Major (later Group Captain) Ernest Norton served in the squadron during World War I.

===Interbellum and World War II===

The squadron was reformed at RAF Manston from a flight of No. 48 Squadron on 15 June 1936, with Avro Ansons as part of the new RAF Coastal Command. It moved to RAF Bircham Newton on 30 July that year. It initially operated as a training squadron, but later assigned to maritime patrols.

On the outbreak of the Second World War, the Squadron entered into a routine of patrols with its Ansons from Bircham Newton with detachments at other bases around the United Kingdom, including RAF Carew Cheriton in South Wales and RAF Hooton Park on the Mersey. The squadron attacked German submarines on two occasions in September, with no effect (the anti-submarine bombs used by the RAF at the time were ineffective weapons - one friendly-fire incident in December 1939 resulted in a direct hit on the conning tower of the British submarine HMS &quot;Snapper&quot; with the sole damage being four broken light bulbs). The squadron&#x27;s Ansons also occasionally encountered German maritime reconnaissance aircraft. On 8 November, one shot down a Heinkel He 115 floatplane. On the same day, a different Anson engaged and hit two Dornier Do 18, probably shooting one down.

In March 1940, the squadron began to re-equip with the Lockheed Hudson, flying the first patrols using the new aircraft on 12 April. It converted to the Boeing Fortress Mk.II in July 1942, allowing long range patrols over the Atlantic, moving to the Azores during October 1943, before returning to the United Kingdom for re-equipping with the Consolidated Liberator Mk.VI, later augmented by the Liberators Mk.VIII. The Squadron&#x27;s Liberators were based at RAF St Eval until after D-Day, when the unit moved North to RAF Leuchars. A section was detached to West Africa for anti-submarine and convoy patrols as No. 200 Squadron RAF. Detachments also operated from bases such as RAF St Eval in Cornwall and RAF Aldergrove in County Antrim. On 25 June 1945 the squadron transferred to Transport Command and flew trooping flights until 25 April 1946 when it disbanded.

206 Squadron was a successful anti-submarine unit, accounting for nine U-boats destroyed during the Second World War.

===Post-war===

The squadron was reformed on 17 November 1947, flying Avro York C.1 transport aircraft, but again disbanded on 31 August 1949. It was soon reformed on 1 December 1949, flying Douglas Dakotas, the military transport version of the well-known Douglas DC-3 airliner. This lasted only till 20 February 1950 however.

Reformed yet again on 27 September 1952 as a maritime reconnaissance squadron, it was equipped with Avro Shackletons and based at RAF St Eval in Cornwall. The squadron moved to RAF Kinloss in Scotland in July 1965 and was re-equipped with the jet-powered Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod in November 1970. It continued to operate the Nimrod until disbanding on 1 April 2005.

===Present===
On 1 April 2009, the Heavy Aircraft Test &amp; Evaluation Squadron at Boscombe Down (Air Space Warfare Centre) gained the 206 Squadron numberplate, as 206 (Reserve) Squadron. Currently split between RAF Boscombe Down and RAF Brize Norton with &#x27;B Flt&#x27; C130 specialists moved from RAF Lyneham in June 2011 to their new home at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to continue the Hercules Test and Evaluation process.

<doc id="462931" wikidata="Q642735" url="?curid=462931" title="Ooid">
<text>Ooids (, ) are small (commonly ≤2 mm in diameter), spheroidal, &quot;coated&quot; (layered) sedimentary grains, usually composed of calcium carbonate, but sometimes made up of iron- or phosphate-based minerals. Ooids usually form on the sea floor, most commonly in shallow tropical seas (around the Bahamas, for example, or in the Persian Gulf). After being buried under additional sediment, these ooid grains can be cemented together to form a sedimentary rock called an &quot;oolite&quot;. Oolites usually consist of calcium carbonate; these belong to the limestone rock family. Pisoids are similar to ooids, but are larger than 2 mm in diameter, often considerably larger, as with the pisoids in the hot springs at Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary) in the Czech Republic. Ooids have been the subject of scientific research for centuries.

==Formation==
An ooid forms as a series of concentric layers around a nucleus. The layers contain crystals arranged radially, tangentially or randomly. The nucleus can be a shell fragment, quartz grain or any other small fragment. Most modern ooids are aragonite, a polymorph of calcium carbonate; some are composed of high-magnesium calcite, and some are bimineralic (layers of calcite and aragonite). Ancient ooids can be calcitic, either originally precipitated as calcite (as in calcite seas), or formed by alteration (neomorphic replacement) of aragonitic ooids (or the aragonite layers in originally bimineralic ooids). Moldic ooids (or molds later filled in by calcite cement) occur in both young and ancient rocks, indicating the removal of a soluble polymorph (usually aragonite).

==Variation==
Whether ooids become calcitic or aragonitic can be linked to strontium/calcium substitution within the crystalline structure. This has been shown in some examples to be due to temperature fluctuations in marine environments, which affects salinity levels, which in turn facilitate the substitution. Marine calcitic ooids were typically formed during calcite sea intervals, especially during the Ordovician and the Jurassic Periods. The geochemistry of these seas was a function of seafloor spreading and fluctuating Mg/Ca ratios. Low Mg/Ca ratios favor the precipitation of low-magnesium calcite.

==Growth mode==
Ooids with radial crystals (such as the aragonitic ooids in the Great Salt Lake, Utah, US) grow by ions extending the lattices of the radial crystals. The mode of growth of ooids with tangential (usually minute needle-like) crystals is less clear. They may be accumulated in a &quot;snowball&quot; fashion from tiny crystals in the sediment or water, or they may crystallize in place on the ooid surface. A hypothesis of growth by accretion (like a snowball) from the polymineralic sediment of fine aragonite, high-magnesium calcite (HMC) and low-magnesium calcite (LMC), must explain how only aragonite needles are added to the ooid cortex. Both in tangential and in radial ooids, the cortex is composed of many very fine increments of growth. Some modern (and ancient) ooids partially or totally lack clear layering and have a micritic (very fine grained) texture. Examination of such micritic ooids by scanning electron microscopy often shows evidence of microbial borings later filled by fine cement.

==Growth factors==
There are several factors that affect ooid growth: supersaturation of the water with respect to calcium carbonate, the availability of nuclei, agitation of the ooids, water depth, and the role of microbes.

==Ooimmuration==
Sometimes fossils are included in ooids, often forming the nuclei. This taphonomic process is termed &quot;ooimmuration&quot; (Wilson et al., 2021). The formation of the ooid cortex around the test or shell protects it from abrasion, fragmentation and bioerosion. Ooimmuration also retains fine organic remains that would ordinarily be winnowed away by currents.

<text>Body image is a person&#x27;s thoughts, feelings and perception of the aesthetics or sexual attractiveness of their own body. The concept of body image is used in several disciplines, including neuroscience, psychology, medicine, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, philosophy, cultural and feminist studies; the media also often uses the term. Across these disciplines, there is no single consensus definition, but broadly speaking, body image consists of the ways people view themselves; their memories, experiences, assumptions, and comparisons about their appearances; and their overall attitudes towards their respective heights, shapes, and weights—all of which are shaped by prevalent social and cultural ideals.

Body image can be negative (&quot;body negativity&quot;), positive (&quot;body positivity&quot;) or neutral in character. A person with a negative body image may feel self-conscious or ashamed and may feel that others are more attractive. In a time where social media holds a very important place and is used frequently in our daily lives, people of different ages are affected emotionally and mentally by the appearance and body size/shape ideals set by the society they live in. These standards that are created and constantly being changed by society can contribute in part to body shaming - the act of humiliating an individual by mocking or making critical comments about a person&#x27;s physiological appearance.

Aside from having low self-esteem, sufferers typically fixate on altering their physical appearances to appease the perceived standards. Such behavior creates body dissatisfaction and higher risks of eating disorders, isolation, and mental illnesses in the long term. In eating disorders, a negative body image may also lead to body image disturbance, an altered perception of the whole one&#x27;s body. Body dissatisfaction also characterizes body dysmorphic disorder, an obsessive-compulsive disorder defined by concerns about some specific aspect of one&#x27;s body (usually face, skin or hair), which is severely flawed and warrants exceptional measures to hide or fix. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or by undergoing cosmetic surgery. On the other hand, positive body image consists of perceiving one&#x27;s figure clearly and correctly, celebrating and appreciating one&#x27;s body, and understanding that one&#x27;s appearance does not reflect one&#x27;s character or worth.

Many factors contribute to a person&#x27;s body image, including family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are either underweight or overweight can have poor body image.

A 2007 report by the American Psychological Association found that a culture-wide sexualization of girls and women was contributing to increased female anxiety associated with body image. An Australian government Senate Standing Committee report on the sexualization of children in the media reported similar findings associated with body image. However, other scholars have expressed concern that these claims are not based on solid data.

== History ==
The phrase &#x27;body-image&#x27; was first coined by Austrian neurologist Paul Schilder in his book &quot;The Image and Appearance of the Human Body&quot; (1935).

Throughout most of history, any feature that implied social status or wealth was ideal. Because of the historical link of wealth to food, those with full-figured frames were seen as rich or powerful. In other regions cultural values and beliefs also heavily influenced body image. In the Han dynasty, features such as clear skin and dark hair were highly prized, as it was thought that damaging the skin and hair your ancestors gave you was disrespectful.

Sought out characteristics have always changed with the evolution of moral and cultural values and sensibilities throughout history. However, cultural icons like Hollywood, fashion designers, and actresses have also influenced body image perception.

Today, advancements in communication technology have resulted in a &quot;platform of delivery in which we intercept and interpret messages about ourselves, our self-worth, and our bodies.&quot; Social media in particular has reshaped the &quot;perfect body&quot;, and presents inconsistent ideals for hair, body type, and skin tone.

==Demographics==
===Women===
&quot;Social currency for girls and women continues to be rooted in physical appearance&quot;. Women &quot;all over the world are evaluated and oppressed by their appearances&quot;, including their ages, skin tones, or sizes.

Many advertisements promote insecurities in their audiences in order to sell them solutions, and so may present retouched images, sexual objectification, and explicit messages that promote &quot;unrealistic images of beauty&quot; and undermine body image, particularly in female audiences.

Body dissatisfaction creates negative attitudes, a damaging mentality, and negative habits in young women. The emphasis on an ideal female body shape and size is psychologically detrimental to young women, who may resort to grooming, dieting, and surgery in order to be happy. &quot;The prevalence of eating disorder development among college females is especially high, with rates up to 24% among college students.&quot; Body dissatisfaction in girls is associated with increased rate of smoking and a decrease in comfort with sexuality when they&#x27;re older, which may lead them to consider cosmetic surgery. The pressure on women and girls &quot;to cope with the effects of culturally induced body insecurity&quot; is &#x27;severe&#x27;. Many reported that &quot;their lives would be better if they were not judged by their looks and body shape, [as] this is leading to low self-esteem, eating disorders, mental health problems and depression.&quot;

Women who compare themselves to images in the media believe they are more overweight than they actually are. One reason for this is because &quot;idealised media images are routinely subjected to computer manipulation techniques, such as airbrushing (e.g. slimming thighs and increasing muscle tone). The resulting images present an unobtainable &#x27;aesthetic perfection&#x27; that has no basis in biological reality.&quot;

Global eating disorder rates such as anorexia and bulimia are gradually rising in adolescent girls. The National Eating Disorders Association, reported that 95% of individuals who suffer from an eating disorder are aged 12 to 26, and anorexia is the third-most-common illness among teenagers. Teenage girls are most prone &quot;to internalize negative messages and obsess about weight loss to obtain a thin appearance&quot;. &quot;Cultural messages about beauty (i.e. what it is, how it should be cultivated, and how it will be rewarded) are often implicitly conveyed through media representations of women.&quot;

However, other researchers have contested the claims of the media effects paradigm. An article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard, for example, argues that peer effects are much more likely to cause body dissatisfaction than media effects, and that media effects have been overemphasized. It also argues that one must be careful about making the leap from arguing that certain environmental conditions might cause body dissatisfaction to the claim that those conditions can cause diagnosable eating disorders.

When female undergraduates were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased; when they were exposed to larger models, it rose. Many women engage in &quot;fat talk&quot; (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one&#x27;s body), a behavior that has been associated with weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. Women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt.

Monteath and McCabe found that 44% of women express negative feelings about both individual body parts and their bodies as a whole. 37.7% of young American males and 51% of young American females express dissatisfaction with their bodies.

In America, the dieting industry earns roughly 40 billion dollars per year. A Harvard study (Fat Talk, Harvard University Press) published in 2000 revealed that 86% of teenage girls are on a diet or believe they should be on one. Dieting has become common even among very young children: 51% of 9- and 10-year-old girls feel better about themselves when they are on diets.

According to a study by Dove, only 4% of women thought they were beautiful, while approximately 70% of women and girls in the UK believed the media&#x27;s portrayal of impractical beauty standards fueled their appearance anxieties. As a result, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that, 91% of women were mostly unhappy with their bodies, while 40% will consider cosmetic surgery to fix their flaws.

=== Men ===
Similarly, media depictions idealizing a muscular physique have led to body dissatisfaction among young men. As many as 45% of teenage boys may suffer from body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on self-perceived bodily flaws. Men may also suffer from muscle dysmorphia and may incessantly pursue muscularity without ever becoming fully satisfied with their physiques.

Research shows that the greatest impact on men&#x27;s criticism of their bodies comes from their male peers, including likeminded individuals or potentially people they admire who are around the same age, as opposed to romantic partners, female peers, or male relatives like fathers or brothers. 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weights and physiques (Malcore, 2016); 29% frequently thought about their appearances.; 50% had recently complained about the way they looked. 25% of males report having been teased about their weight, while 33% specify social media as the source for self-consciousness. Following celebrities on social media sites makes it possible to interact personally with celebrities, which has been shown to influence male body image. A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others. 53% of boys cited advertisements as a &quot;major source of pressure to look good; [though] social media (57%) and friends (68%) exerted more influence, while celebrities (49%) were slightly less persuasive&quot;. 22% of adolescent boys thought that the ideals depicted by the media were aspirational, while 33% called them healthy.

The ideal male body is perceived to feature a narrow waist and hips, broad shoulders, a well-developed upper body, [and] toned &quot;six-pack&quot; abs. The figure may be traced back to an idealized male doll, G.I. Joe. The &quot;bulked-up action heroes, along with the brawny characters in many video games, present an anatomically impossible ideal for boys, much as Barbie promotes proportions that are physically impossible for girls.&quot; Boys who are exposed to depictions of muscular warriors who solve problems with their fists may internalize the lesson that aggression and muscles are essential to masculinity.

Some studies have reported a higher incidence of body dissatisfaction among Korean boys and girls than among boys and girls living in the United States, while noting that these studies fail to control for the slimmer and smaller size of Koreans as compared with Westerners. A cross-cultural analysis of the United States and South Korea focusing on social media found that between South Korean men and American men, Korean men are more concerned with their body image in relation to their social media use.

Teenage boys may participate in extreme workouts and weight training, and may abuse supplements and steroids to further increase muscle mass. In 2016, 10.5% acknowledged the use of muscle-enhancing substances, while 5 to 6% of respondents admitted to the use of steroids. Although dieting is often overlooked, a significant increase in eating disorders is present among men. Currently, males account for 1 in 4 of those suffering from eating disorders, while 31% have admitted to purging or binge eating in the past.

Men often desire up to 26 pounds of additional muscle mass. Men who endorse traditional masculine ideas are more likely to desire additional muscle. The connection between masculinity and muscle can be traced to classical antiquity.

Men with lower, more feminine waist–hip ratios (WHR) feel less comfortable and self-report lower body esteem and self-efficacy than men with higher, more masculine, WHRs.

=== Gender differences ===
Although body dissatisfaction is more common in women, men are becoming increasingly negatively affected. In a longitudinal study that assessed body image across time and age between men and women, men placed greater significance on their physical appearances than women, even though women reported body image dissatisfaction more often. The difference was strongest among adolescents. One theory to explain the discrepancy is that women have already become accustomed and desensitized to media scrutiny.

Studies suggest that the significance placed upon body image improved among women as they got older; men in comparison showed little variation in their attitude. Another suggested that &quot;relative to men, women are considerably more psychologically aware of their appearances. Moreover, women&#x27;s greater concern over body image has a greater impact on their daily lives.&quot;

As men and women reach older age, body image takes on a different meaning. Research studies show that the importance attached to physical appearance decreases with age.

=== Weight ===
The desire to lose weight is highly correlated with poor body image. Kashubeck-West &quot;et al.&quot; reported that when considering only men and women who desire to lose weight, sex differences in body image disappear.

In her book &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;, Naomi Wolf reported that &quot;thirty-three thousand women told American researchers they would rather lose ten to fifteen pounds than achieve any other goal.&quot; Through repeated images of excessively thin women in media, advertisement, and modeling, thinness has become associated with not only beauty, but happiness and success. As Charisse Goodman put it in her article, &quot;One Picture is Worth a Thousand Diets&quot;, advertisements have changed society&#x27;s ideas of beauty and ugliness: &quot;Indeed to judge by the phrasing of the ads, &#x27;slender&#x27; and &#x27;attractive&#x27; are one word, not two in the same fashion as &#x27;fat&#x27; and &#x27;ugly.&#x27;&quot;

Research by Martin and Xavier (2010) shows that people feel more pressure from society to be thin after viewing ads featuring a slim model. Ads featuring a larger sized model resulted in less pressure to be thin. People also felt their actual body sizes were larger after viewing a slim model as compared to a larger model.

Many, like journalist Marisa Meltzer, have argued this contemporary standard of beauty to be described as anorexic thinness, an unhealthy idea that is not representative of a natural human body: &quot;Never before has the &#x27;perfect&#x27; body been at such odds with our true size.&quot; However, these figures do not distinguish between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct.

Post-1997 studies indicate that around 64% of American adults are overweight, such that if the 56%/40% female/male dissatisfaction rates in the &quot;Psychology Today&quot; study have held steady since its release, those dissatisfaction rates are if anything disproportionately low: although some individuals continue to believe themselves to be overweight when they are not, those persons are now outnumbered by persons who might be expected to be dissatisfied with their bodies but are not.

Some argue that the social pressure to lose weight has lessened what is described in both popular and academic parlance as an &quot;obesity epidemic&quot;, despite the adverse effects. Overweight children experience not only discrimination but overall body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, social isolation and depression. Because of the negative stigma, the child may suffer severely from emotional and physical ailments that could persist past childhood into adulthood.

=== Race ===
The association of light skin with moral virtue dates back at least to the medieval era, and was reinforced during the Atlantic slave trade. The medieval theory that all races originated from the white race was an early source of the longstanding association of white bodies and beauty ideals with &quot;normality&quot; and other racial phenotypes as aberrant. The 1960s Black is Beautiful movement attempted to end that mindset.

A lack of black women in the fashion industry contributes to body image issues among African-American women. However, a 2003 experiment presented three photographs of attractive white, black and Asian women to white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women and white women both reported similar levels of body dissatisfaction, while black women were less dissatisfied with their own appearances. These findings are consistent with previous research showing that black women generally have higher self-esteem than white or Asian women in America.

One study found that, among women, East Asian women are more satisfied with their bodies than white women. East Asian men reported more body dissatisfaction than white males did. Western men desire as much as 30 pounds more muscle mass than do Asian men.

=== Sexuality ===
There is no scientific consensus on how a person&#x27;s sexuality affects their body image. For example, a 2013 study found that lesbian-identifying women reported less body dissatisfaction than did heterosexual women. In contrast, a 2015 study found no differences in weight satisfaction between heterosexual and lesbian and bisexual women, and no differences in the amount of pressure to be thin they experienced from the media, sexual partners, friends or family. This research did find that heterosexual women were more likely to have internalised the thin ideal (accepted the Western concept that thinness equals attractiveness) than lesbian and bisexual women.

Lesbian and bisexual women have said that while they are often critical of mainstream body size/shape ideals these are still the ideals that they feel social pressure to conform to. In a study conducted in 2017, Henrichs-Beck and Szymanski claimed that lesbian gender definition within the lesbian culture may dictate whether or not they are dissatisfied with their bodies. They suggested that lesbians who identified as more stereotypically &#x27;feminine&#x27; were at greater risk of body dissatisfaction, while those who identified as more &#x27;butch&#x27;, were traditionally more satisfied with their bodies. Qualitative research with non-heterosexual women found that female sexual/romantic partners were a source of both body confidence and concerns. These women reported that while they compared their body size and shape to that of their partner, and could feel more self-conscious if their partner was slimmer than them, their attractions to women who did not conform to the narrow Western definition of ‘beauty’ gave them confidence in their own appearance.

A 2005 study found that gay men were more likely than straight men to have body image dissatisfaction, diet more, and were more fearful of becoming fat. There is some evidence to link the sexual objectification of gay males and heterosexual females by men in general as a reason for increased numbers in these groups for eating disorders and stimulants addictions. Bisexual people have historically been overlooked within body image research, either subsumed under gay/lesbian labels or ignored completely.

==Causes==
=== Fashion industry ===
Fashion magazines directed at females subtly promote thinness and diet practices, and teenagers heavily rely on them for beauty and fashion advice. &quot;Seventeen&quot; in particular recorded one of the highest number of articles devoted to appearances; 69% of girls reported that it had influenced their ideal body shapes. 50% of advertisements featured also used beauty appeal to sell products. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that 90% of teenage girls felt a need to change their appearances, and that 81% of 10-year-olds were already afraid of being fat. According to a survey by Manchester Metropolitan University, &quot;self-esteem and views of body image suffered after the participants were shown magazine pictures of models, [suggests] that media portrayal of images can prolong anorexia and bulimia in women and may even be a cause of it&quot;. A 2014 survey of 13- to 17-year-old Americans found that 90% &quot;felt pressured by fashion and media industries to be skinny&quot;, and that 65% believed that the bodies portrayed were too thin. More than 60% habitually compared themselves to models, and 46% strove to resemble models&#x27; bodies.

According to Dove&#x27;s &quot;The 2017 Dove Global Beauty and Confidence&quot; &quot;Report&quot;, &quot;a total of 71% of women and 67% of girls want to call on the media to do a better job portraying women of diverse physical appearance, age, race, shape and size.&quot; In addition, 67% of men now strongly believe that it is unacceptable for brands to use photo manipulation techniques to alter the body image of a model. In response, the fashion magazine industry has made efforts to include &#x27;real&#x27; women, and to reduce or ban the use of airbrushing tools. Likewise, some fashion brands and retailers adopt vanity sizing in their assortments to try to intentionally raise a customer&#x27;s self-esteem while shopping in stores. This involves labeling clothes with smaller sizes than the actual cut of the items to trick and attract the consumer.

Fashion models themselves have experienced negative body image due to industry pressures: 69% reported that they were told to tone up, while 62% reported that their agencies had required them to lose weight or change their body shapes. 54% of models revealed that they would be dropped by their agencies if they failed to comply. Models frequently have underweight body mass index (BMI): a study published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders discovered that a majority of models had a BMI of 17.41, which qualifies as anorexia. In the past twenty years, runway models have also transformed from a typical size 6–8 to 0–2. The average weight of an American model was recorded to be twenty-three percent less than that of an average American woman. In 2006, the fashion industry came under fire due to the untimely deaths of two models, Luisel Ramos and Ana Carolina Reston, both of whom had suffered from eating disorders and been severely underweight. Other models endure intensive exercise regimes, diets, fasts, and detoxes; in order to maintain or lose weight. In addition, 17% have admitted to stimulant abuse, while another 8% frequently engaged in self-induced vomiting to induce weight loss.

Fashion industry insiders argue that clothes hang better on tall, thin catwalk models, but critics respond that an overemphasis on that body type communicates an unhealthy and unrealistic body image to the public.

=== Attempts at promoting body positivity ===
Various jurisdictions have taken steps to protect models and promote healthier body image. The U.K. and the U.S. have pursued social education campaigns. Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel prohibit models from working with a BMI below 18.5. France similarly forbids the employment of extremely skinny models, and requires medical certificates to verify their health.

France is also working on ensuring retailers specify when an image is airbrushed in magazines, websites, and advertisements, although it is unclear whether consumers are already aware of digital retouching techniques. Companies in France who want to avoid a fine must label their post if the image has been altered for enhancement.

Fashion conglomerates Kering and LVMH recently &quot;announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2&quot;. in hopes of improving the working conditions of models and inspiring others to follow suit. Critics have objected that to ban size-zero models from working constitutes discrimination or thin-shaming. Moreover, the announcement of a small minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to &quot;send the message that super slim body types is the &#x27;ideal&#x27;&quot;. Plus-size models are slowly emerging in mainstream media, which may improve body image. Prominent plus-size models include Ashley Graham, the face of popular plus-size retailer Lane Bryant, and Iskra Lawrence, a classified role model for lingerie and swimwear retailer aerie. Christian Siriano cast five plus-size models for his New York Fashion Week shows. Siriano made global headlines after he designed a gown for plus-sized actress Leslie Jones.

The lack of fashion-forward plus-size clothing in the fashion industry has given rise to the #PlusIsEqual movement. High-street brands such as Forever 21 and ASOS have increased plus-size product offerings. Other brands include Victoria Beckham&#x27;s, who plans to release a range of high-street clothing with sizes up to XXXL, and Nike, which expanded its plus-size collection sizes 1X to 3X. In response to the criticism that the term plus-size caused unnecessary labeling, Kmart replaced its numerical sizing with positive tags such as, &quot;lovely&quot; and &quot;fabulous&quot; instead.

Models have notably used Instagram as a tool to &quot;encourage self-acceptance, fight back against body-shamers, and post plenty of selfies celebrating their figure&quot;. In the U.S., a group of plus-size models launched the #DearNYFW campaign, which targeted the fashion industry&#x27;s &#x27;harmful approach&#x27; towards their bodies. This movement was broadcast across different social media platforms, with other models using the hashtag to share their experiences, in hopes of persuading the American fashion industry to start &quot;prioritizing health and celebrate diversity on the runway&quot;. Fashion photographer Tarik Carroll released a photo series titled the &quot;EveryMAN Project&quot; to showcase large-framed queer and transgender men of color, with the stated purpose of &quot;challenging hyper-masculinity and gender norms, while bringing body-positivity to the forefront&quot;.

Another tactic to promote body positivity has been to protest against photo retouching. In 2014, the Aarie Real campaign promised to display &quot;campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads&quot;. Neon Moon, a feminist lingerie brand from London, advocates the beauty of flaws, instead of the need to retouch its models for aesthetic purposes. Another tactic was used by the U.S. e-tailer ModCloth, in which it employed its own staff as models for its swimwear collection.

=== Social media ===
Beauty standards are being enforced and shaped by social media. Users are constantly exposed to notifications, posts, and photos about the lives of others. Despite the ability to create and control content on social media, the online environment still enforces the same beauty standards that traditional media promoted. Over-engagement with social networking platforms and images can lead to unattainable ideas of beauty standards. Oftentimes, the look of the people they idealize is the result of medical procedures. Influencers and celebrities change the way they look with the help of medical procedures, such as lip augmentation, which became a trend. There was an increase of 759% in botox procedures between 2000 and the late 2010s.

In an international study of social media apps, photo-based social media apps, predominately Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, were found to have a negative impact on the body image of men more than non-photo-based social media apps. Another study by the Florida Health Experience found that &quot;87% of women and 65% of men compare their bodies to images they consume on social and traditional media.&quot; They also found that users felt like they got more positive attention towards their bodies if they altered them in some way. A study by the University of South Australia discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalize the thin ideal.

Applications, such as Instagram, have become a &quot;body-image battleground&quot;, while &quot;selfie&quot; is what individuals use to criticize their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the high points of their lives, a survey by Common Sense Media reported that 22% felt bad if their posts were ignored, or if they did not receive the amount of attention they had hoped for. Instagram is ranked at the most detrimental to mental health according to a study done by the Royal Society for Mental Health. The increased use of body and facial reshaping applications such as Snapchat and Facetune has been identified as a potential cause of body dysmorphia. Social media apps that have body altering filters contribute to body image issues which most often result in eating disorders and body dysmorphia. Recently, a phenomenon referred to as &#x27;Snapchat dysmorphia&#x27; has been used to describe people who request surgery to look like the edited versions of themselves as they appear through Snapchat filters.

Many users digitally manipulate the self-portraits they post to social media. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35-year-old women edited their images before uploading. 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online.

Reports have also shown that the messages delivered by &quot;fitspiration&quot; websites are sometimes identical to the &quot;thinspiration&quot; or pro-anorexia types. This is evident through &quot;language inducing guilt about weight or the body, and promoted dieting&quot;. The marketing of restrictive diets to young women as a form of self care can cause &quot;increasingly disordered eating&quot;, and orthorexia, an obsession with the right and wrong types of food.

==== Attempted social media tackling of the issue ====
In an attempt to tackle such issues, the UK launched a national campaign called Be Real, after findings showed 76% of secondary school students who learnt about body confidence in class felt more positive about themselves. The stated goal of this movement was to improve body confidence through educational resources provided to schools, and persuading the media, businesses, and the diet industry to endorse different body shapes and sizes instead.

Social media platforms such as Instagram have banned the use of &quot;thinspiration and &quot;thinspo&quot; related hashtags. Other solutions include the promotion of hashtags such as #SelfLove and #BodyPositivity, and the promotion of &quot;transformation photos&quot;, side-by-side images displaying an individual&#x27;s fitness or weight-loss progress, which users have utilized to showcase the deceptiveness of social media. Eating Disorder Hope launched the Pro-Recovery Movement, a live Twitter chat encouraging sufferers to celebrate self-love and a positive body image, through recovery subject matters. Project HEAL introduced a campaign called #WhatMakesMeBeautiful, with the stated aim of celebrating admirable attributes other than appearance.

There have been recent demands for social media sites to highlight photos that have been edited and prevent universal publication.

== Measurement ==
Body image can be measured by asking a subject to rate their current and ideal body shape using a series of depictions. The difference between these two values is the measure of body dissatisfaction.

There are currently more than 40 &quot;instruments&quot; used to measure body image. All of these instruments can be put into three categories: figure preferences, video projection techniques, and questionnaires. Because there are so many ways to measure body image, it is difficult to draw meaningful research generalizations. Many factors have to be taken into account when measuring body image, including gender, ethnicity, culture, and age.

=== Figure rating scales ===
One of the measures of body image is figure rating scales, which present a series of body images graded from thin to muscular or from thin to obese. The subject is asked to indicate which figure best represents their current perceived body, and which represents their ideal or desired body. Bodies depicted in figure rating scales are either hand-drawn silhouettes, computer rendered images, or photographic images.

=== Video projection techniques ===
One study showed each participant a series of images of himself or herself with either increased weight or decreased weight. Each participant was asked to respond to the pictures, and their startle and eyeblink responses were measured. &quot;Objective, psychophysiological measures, like the affect modulated startle eyeblink response, are less subject to reporting bias.&quot;

=== Questionnaires ===
BASS is a 9-item subscale of the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire. It uses a rating scale from −2 to +2 and assesses eight body areas and attributes and overall appearance (face, hair, lower torso, mid-torso, upper torso, muscle tone, height, and weight).

Questionnaires can have variable responses. For instance, &quot;Acquiescent response style (ARS), or the tendency to agree with items on a survey, is more common among individuals from Asian and African cultures.&quot;

<text>Tupperware is an American company that manufactures and internationally distributes preparation, storage, and serving containers for the kitchen and home. It was founded in 1942 by Earl Tupper, who developed his first bell-shaped container and introduced the products to the public in 1946.

As of 2007, it was sold by approximately 1.9 million direct salespeople on contract. In 2013, the top marketplace for Tupperware was Indonesia, topping Germany. Indonesia&#x27;s sales in 2013 were more than $200 million.

In September 2024, when its parent company filed for bankruptcy, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Tupperware Brands Corporation (TBC). Two months later, it was announced that a company formed by a group of TBC secured lenders, Party Products LLC, had completed the purchase of the brand, as well as certain related operations.

==Company history==

=== Early years ===
Earl Tupper (1907–1983) purchased polyethylene pellets from DuPont to build Tupperware products in 1938. He developed the first product in 1946 in Leominster, Massachusetts. The polyethylene plastic containers could be used in households to contain food and keep them airtight, and featured a &quot;burping seal&quot; that was patented in 1949. 

The product became notable with a sale-through-presentation idea, held in a party setting. Tupperware developed a direct marketing strategy known as the party plan to sell products. The party plan called Tupperware party enabled women of the 1950s to earn an income while keeping their focus in the domestic domain. Brownie Wise (1913–1992), a former sales representative of Stanley Home Products, started organizing more of these parties and was soon made vice president of marketing in 1951. Later, she created Tupperware Parties Inc. Women at the parties were exhorted to sell more via the slogan &quot;No Sex, No Sup, Just Tup-Tup-Tup!&quot;.

During the early 1950s Tupperware products gained popularity and sales increased. The company continued the Tupperware parties and rewarded top-selling women.

=== 1960–2000 ===
Tupperware expanded to Europe in 1960 when Mila Pond hosted Tupperware parties in Weybridge, England, and other locations around the world. A comparison technique called &quot;carrot calling&quot; was used by the representatives wherein they would travel door-to-door in a neighborhood and ask housewives to compare carrots placed in a Tupperware container with anything that they would have ordinarily left them in. These would lead to scheduling of a Tupperware party.

In 1977, Rexall, the owner of the Tupperware brand, sold its namesake drugstores and renamed itself Dart Industries. Dart merged with Kraft Foods to form Dart &amp; Kraft. The company demerged, with the former Dart assets renamed to Premark International. Tupperware Brands was spun off from Premark in 1996.

Tupperware also produced limited products outside its core preparation and storage lines. The Shape O is a toddler toy/puzzle, first produced in 1969. Ten different geometric shapes are inserted into corresponding holes in the ball to complete the game.

=== 2001–present ===

In 2003 Tupperware closed down operations in the UK and Ireland, citing customer dissatisfaction with their direct sales model. The company relaunched in the UK in mid-2011, and recruited UK staff, but in December the relaunch was canceled. 

As of 2007 Tupperware was sold by means of approximately 1.9 million direct salespeople on contract.

In May 2018, the Israeli daily &quot;TheMarker&quot; reported that Tupperware will withdraw from Israel leaving 2,000 agents without a job. Tupperware Israel relaunched in December 2020 as an online shop. In March 2021 Tupperware closed down operations in the Netherlands. In August 2022, Tupperware announced it would be leaving the New Zealand market in late 2022.

In 2022 Tupperware has faced criticism for continuing its operations and actively hiring in Russia despite the country’s invasion of Ukraine. This decision has drawn scrutiny as many multinational companies have ceased their activities in Russia to comply with international sanctions and condemn the war, which has caused widespread civilian casualties and devastation in Ukraine. Critics argue that Tupperware&#x27;s ongoing presence in Russia undermines global efforts to isolate the aggressor state and holds the company complicit in prioritizing profits over ethical considerations during a time of geopolitical crisis. 

On November 2, 2022, after publishing quarterly results, the company said its inability to maintain compliance with its credit agreement raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The stock value dropped more than 40%. In April 2023 the company warned that there is &quot;substantial doubt about the company&#x27;s ability to continue as a going concern&quot;. The stock price dropped almost 50% on the same day. On April 11, 2023, Tupperware&#x27;s stock value plummeted to $1.30. Although there was a slight recovery the following day, its sliding sales and increasing debt prompted warnings of permanent company closure unless it receives substantial investment.

As of April 2023 Tupperware had 82 countries listed as places they trade. In May 2023, a financially-ailing Tupperware signed on Moelis &amp; Co. to explore various available strategic options, as it also detected inconsistencies in its prior periods&#x27; financial reportings.

On June 1, 2023, Tupperware stopped supplying an independent sales force in the UK and Ireland and moved fully to selling online and via the shopping TV channel Ideal World, shortly before Ideal World itself went out of business in early July 2023.

On October 14, 2023, Laurie Ann Goldman became CEO and board director following leadership roles at Spanx, Avon and Guess. Tupperware Chair Susan Cameron said in a prepared statement that Goldman “brings the right mix of business and brand experience and has built consumer affinity for some of the world&#x27;s most iconic brands.” 

On June 14, 2024, Tupperware announced that it would close its last remaining US manufacturing plant in Hemingway, South Carolina and shift production to their plant in Lerma in Mexico, with the closure to be completed in January 2025.

On September 16, 2024, Tupperware Brands Corp. announced that they were preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection later in the week after a failed comeback after beneficial sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company&#x27;s stock fell nearly 60% after the announcement. On September 18, Tupperware Brands filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, with plans to continue operating during the proceedings. Lenders involved are advocating for a foreclosure in order to claim assets. 
On October 22, with $818 million obligations, it signed a deal with lenders for $23.5 million cash and $63 million debt relief in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware bankruptcy court for approval of Judge Brendan Shannon. In November 2024, the Tupperware brand name was acquired by Party Products LLC, who will allow for Tupperware&#x27;s operations to continue.

==Tupperware parties==

Tupperware is still sold mostly through a party plan. A Tupperware party is run by a Tupperware consultant as a host or hostess who invites friends and neighbors into their home to see the product line. Parties also take place in workplaces, schools, and other community groups. To stay in touch with its sales force, Tupperware published the monthly magazine &quot;Tupperware Sparks&quot;. The magazine had snapshots of saleswomen posing with awards and recognition for high sales. To avoid spending money on advertising, Tupperware created events that attracted free publicity.

The multi-level marketing strategy adopted by Tupperware has been criticized as manipulative. Statistics released by Tupperware in 2018 showed that 94% of its active distributors remained on the lowest level of the pyramid, with average gross earnings of $653.

In recent years, Tupperware in North America has moved to a new business model which includes more emphasis on direct marketing channels and eliminated its dependency on authorized distributorships. This transition included selling through Target stores in the US and Superstores in Canada with disappointing results. In countries with a focus on marketing through parties (such as Germany, Australia, and New Zealand), Tupperware&#x27;s market share and profitability continue to decline. In New Zealand, products can be also purchased online without a salesperson. 

In China, Tupperware products are sold through franchised &quot;entrepreneurial shopfronts&quot;, of which there were 1,900 in 2005, due to pyramid selling laws enacted in 1998. 

==Feminist reactions==
Feminist academics had different reactions to Tupperware. A more positive interpretation argued Tupperware provided employment for women who were pregnant or otherwise not guaranteed their position at work due to unequal laws in the workplace. Opposing views argued that the intended gendered product and selling campaign further domesticates women, and keeps their predominant focus on homemaking. Negative views also argued Tupperware helped keep women restricted to the domestic sphere.

<doc id="462945" wikidata="Q1470995" url="?curid=462945" title="Chickasaw Campaign of 1736">
<text>The Chickasaw Campaign of 1736 (February 28 – March 25, 1736), also known as the First Chickasaw War, consisted of two pitched battles by the French and allies against Chickasaw fortified villages in present-day Northeast Mississippi. Under the overall direction of the governor of Louisiana, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, a force from Upper Louisiana attacked &quot;Ogoula Tchetoka&quot; on March 25, 1736. A second force from Lower Louisiana attacked &quot;Ackia&quot; on May 26, 1736. Both attacks were bloodily repulsed (see Atkinson, 2004).

==Strategic situation==
The French empire of New France extended from New Orleans in the south to Canada in the north. Its unity was disrupted only by the presence of hostile Natchez and Chickasaw tribes in the lower Mississippi River valley. The French effort to reduce these hostile tribes and gain free passage along the Mississippi culminated in the Chickasaw Wars.

Since 1716, the French and Choctaw had united against the Natchez in an overt campaign of destruction. By 1736, the Natchez were killed or scattered, with many of them taking refuge among the Chickasaw. Bienville wanted to destroy these Natchez remnants, and reduce the Chickasaw: &#x27;It is absolutely necessary that some bold and remarkable blow be struck, to impress the Indians with a proper sense of respect and duty toward us.&#x27; He planned coordinated operations by two forces: one under Pierre d&#x27;Artaguette, commander of the Illinois District of Louisiana, from the North; and a larger army under himself from the South. These forces were to meet &#x27;at the Chickasaw villages&#x27; on March 31, 1736.

==Battle of Ogoula Tchetoka==

D&#x27;Artaguette at Fort de Chartres collected detachments throughout the Illinois Country and proceeded with great expedition to Chickasaw Bluff at present-day Memphis. Despite failing to meet promised detachments under de Monchervaux and de Grandpré, he resumed his march with Chicagou and de Vincennes to the Chickasaw lands, only to be advised by courier that the southern army was late and that he should act according to his own judgement.

Unable or unwilling to wait any longer, d&#x27;Artaguette arrived before a seemingly isolated village at Ogoula Tchetoka (part of Chuckalissa, or Old Town in present-day northwest Tupelo, Mississippi) with 130 French regulars and militia and 366 Iroquois, Quapaw, Miami, and Illinois warriors. The day was &#x27;Palm Sunday&#x27;, March 25. Leaving 30 French behind to guard supplies, d&#x27;Artaguette&#x27;s northern force attacked with &#x27;great vigor&#x27; but was pinned down, routed, and furiously pursued, and its baggage train of valuable shot and powder was captured. Surviving remnants scattered back to meet the belated de Monchervaux on the return trail; Bienville wrote that, without the firm resistance given by the Iroquois and Quapaw, not a single Frenchman would have survived. According to French reports, twenty-one of the French were captured of whom nineteen, including d&#x27;Artaguette thrice wounded in battle, were executed by burning, some of whom were already dead when thrown into large fires. Two Frenchmen were held in hope of exchange for an imprisoned Chickasaw chief, but were eventually sent to the British in South Carolina.

A contemporary memoir by Dumont de Montigny mistakenly reported this battle as taking place on May 20, 1736, leading to confusion in many later accounts.

==Battle of Ackia==


Ackia (in present-day south Tupelo, Mississippi) was attacked by the Southern force. The French contingent, including grenadiers, regulars, Swiss, and various companies of militia, assembled at Mobile throughout March 1736. Starting the first of April, the French proceeded by boat with little loss 270 river miles up the Tombigbee River. On April 23, the army reached its forward depot at Fort Tombecbé (which had been prepared at present-day Jones Bluff, Sumter County, Alabama, in anticipation of this campaign), and there mustered 544 European and 45 African men, excluding officers, before being met up-river by a 600 man Choctaw contingent. Departing Fort Tombecbé on May 4 by boat and on foot, the combined army continued upriver and reached the vicinity of present-day Amory, Mississippi, on May 22. Quickly fortifying a base camp to protect the supplies and boats, essential for its return, the army departed on May 24 for the nearest Chickasaw village, located about 20 miles across the prairie to the northwest.

On May 26, the army approached three fortified hilltop villages, named Ackia, Tchoukafalaya, and Apeony, collectively called Long Town. As the villages came into view it became apparent that a British flag flew over one of them. As they got closer the French saw a number of Englishmen among the Chickasaws. After this discovery, the Chevalier de Noyan, Bienville&#x27;s nephew, urged an immediate attack. After some debate the army advanced to attack, with the French contingent in typically European order, and the Choctaw noisily but reluctantly covering the flanks. Avoiding Apeony, where a trader&#x27;s cabin flew a British flag, the force stormed Ackia under cover of large shields or mats called &quot;mantelets&quot;. The French immediately received &#x27;a shower of balls&#x27; from the Chickasaw fortifications, and the mantelets proved to be ineffective. The attack became pinned down on the side of the hill with steadily mounting casualties. Several outlying cabins were taken, but after several hours&#x27; combat the French fell back &#x27;without having been able to make the slightest breach&#x27; in the fortress at the point of attack. During the night the Chickasaws further improved their position by razing surrounding cabins and vegetation. The French, short of ammunition and provisions, and worried that they could not carry any more wounded, and with no information from d&#x27;Artaguette, retreated the way they came having lost roughly two hundred men (roughly 100 killed and 100 wounded) in an ultimately futile campaign.

==Assessment==

B. F. French stated &#x27;The war was rashly brought and rashly conducted. Bienville entered the enemy&#x27;s country without any means of siege, made one attack on a fort, and then, without attempting by scouts to open a communication with D&#x27;Artaguette, whom he had ordered to meet him in the Chickasaw country on the 10th of May [sic], or making any attempt to give him proper orders, without even taking one Chickasaw prisoner to get any information of D&#x27;Artaguette&#x27;s proceedings, he retreated, and ended the campaign disastrously.&#x27; Atkinson described as &#x27;stupid&#x27; the frontal assaults against positions that were practically invincible. A Frenchman&#x27;s relation of the observations of a Choctaw chief named Red Shoes is quoted by Atkinson: &#x27;The French did not know at all the way to carry on war; we had been able to take only a little village of thirty of forty men; that on the contrary we had lost many men without being able to say that we had killed a single one; that our troops heavily clad marched with too slow a step and so close together that it was impossible for the Chickasaws to fire without killing some of them and wounding several.&#x27;
The Chickasaw were amply equipped with English arms via a trade route from the English and small Chickasaw settlements in South Carolina and Georgia. Their rectangular palisade forts with loopholed walls were complemented by round fortified houses, also with loopholes. With this technology the Chickasaw invincibly maintained their homeland against relentless pressure from the French and Choctaw, including a repeat campaign in 1739 and numerous small attacks by Choctaws for the next 20 years.

A village once thought to possess archaeological remains of Ackia battleground was made a U.S. National Monument in 1938. The National Park Service realized only a few years after establishment of the National Monument that Ackia and the battle were not located there, and it was absorbed into the Natchez Trace Parkway in 1961. It is now called &#x27;Chickasaw Village.&#x27; Research 25 years later, however, determined that the actual site of Ackia and its neighboring villages are in a developed area of south Tupelo. A subdivision called &#x27;Lee Acres&#x27; covers the site of the 1736 Battle of Ackia, cited by historians as a pivotal rebuff to French territorial ambitions in the Southeast.

<text>Broadcast.com was an Internet radio company founded as AudioNet in September 1995 by Cameron Christopher Jaeb. Todd Wagner and Mark Cuban later led the company&#x27;s daily operations which was eventually sold to Yahoo! on April 1, 1999, for $5.7 billion, making it the most expensive acquisition Yahoo! has made. The service has since been discontinued.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1989 as Cameron Audio Networks, named after its founder Cameron Christopher Jaeb, who received an initial investment from his father. Jaeb wanted a method for people to be able to listen to out-of-town sports games. The original idea, a shortwave radio that would receive broadcasts inside a sports venue, morphed into a handheld device that would receive customized satellite broadcasts. With the support of his father Tom, Jaeb incorporated.

Jaeb then began soliciting the rights to broadcast radio and professional sports games live on the Internet, making 80–100 calls per day.

In 1994, through a class that his girlfriend was taking, Jaeb was introduced to Todd Wagner, an attorney at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld. Wagner introduced Jaeb to Mark Cuban, who invested $10,000 in exchange for 2% of the company. Cuban wanted to listen to the basketball games of his alma mater, Indiana University. Cuban and Wagner worked out a deal whereby Jaeb would keep 10% of the company and would get a monthly salary of $2,500 but Cuban would take control of the company. The company was renamed AudioNet.com in September 1995 in conjunction with the reorganization. At first, Cuban picked up signals from KLIF (AM) in his bedroom and then streamed them on the Internet. The company grew from mainly broadcasting sporting events to broadcasting U.S. presidential nominating conventions and many other events.

In 1998, AudioNet was renamed to Broadcast.com and in July 1998, the company became a public company via an initial public offering. The stock price soared 250% on its first day of trading, a record for a newly-issued public stock. After the IPO, the company was worth $1 billion, Mark Cuban was worth $300 million, and Todd Wagner was worth $170 million.

On April 1, 1999, less than nine months after the IPO, Yahoo! announced the acquisition of Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in stock. At the time, Broadcast.com had 570,000 users and the purchase price was $10,000 per user. Cuban sold most of his Yahoo! stock that same year, netting over $1 billion. Founder Chris Jaeb, whose stake was diluted to less than 1% of the company, received approximately $50 million from the sale.

The service became a part of Yahoo! Broadcast Services.

Yahoo! shut down much of its broadcast services in 2002, and Broadcast.com has since been discontinued. Yahoo!&#x27;s high-profile purchase of Broadcast.com has since been called one of the worst Internet acquisitions.

<doc id="462949" wikidata="Q1284788" url="?curid=462949" title="Schnorrer">
<text>Schnorrer (; also spelled shnorrer) is a Yiddish pejorative term for a beggar who, unlike ordinary beggars, presents himself as respectable and feels entitled for the alms received.

==Historical==
A large number of beggars appeared in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the pogroms of the Khmelnytsky Uprising, when many homes were destroyed. Schnorrers begged for themselves, for the dowries of poor brides (), or for the restoration of a house that had burned down. This practice was allowed even when it disrupted the public study of the Torah. Azriel Hildesheimer was described as the &quot;international schnorrer&quot; for his calls for philanthropy in many countries he visited.

Milton Hindus, commenting on the picaresque novel &quot;The King of Schnorrers&quot;, wrote that the Jews did not regard outcasts as failures, and assumed social responsibility for them. &quot;Properly exploited by a fertile intelligence like Menasseh’s, this attitude enables the ostensible mendicant to become the actual master in the eleemosynary relationship.&quot;

==Jewish humor==
Schnorrers are a common butt of Jewish jokes, depicting his living off his wits and his dignified entitlement to handouts.

(One of many variants) A schnorrer comes to a wealthy businessman and asks for a handout. &quot;Have a pity for a poor shoemaker whose family is starving&quot;. - &quot;But aren&#x27;t we the one who asked for alms from me last week presenting yourselves as a carpenter?&quot; - &quot;So true, who can in these bad times support himself from just one job?&quot;

Moishe the shnorrer is outraged to hear that his wealthy patron has halved his annual allowance. The donor apologetically explains that his son has married a woman of expensive tastes and he, the father, must foot the bill. &quot;He can marry who he wants&quot;, retorts the shnorrer. &quot;Just not with my money&quot;.

Sigmund Freud in his 1905 joke collection &quot;Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious&quot; (its 1905 translation is in public domain now together with the original) gives the following interpretation of a shnorrer&#x27;s entitlement.
== In film and literature ==
*Israel Zangwill&#x27;s 1894  picaresque novel &quot;The King of Schnorrers&quot; 
**Bernard Herrmann wrote a musical comedy based on Zangwill&#x27;s novel, which ran on Broadway for a short time in 1979.
*The comedian Jackie Mason often poked fun at the stereotype of Jews as schnorrers.
*Father Phil in Season 1 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; often refers to himself as a &quot;schnorrer,&quot; going to parishioner&#x27;s homes to eat their home cooking, commonly that of Carmela Soprano. He defines a &quot;schnorrer&quot; as &quot;Somebody who always shows up in time for free grub.&quot; He attributes this language to growing up in Yonkers, NY, among many Jewish people.

<text>Figures on a Beach was an early synth-pop and beyond band from Detroit, Michigan that was active from 1981 to 1992. The band had two charting singles in 1989: &quot;Accidentally 4th Street (Gloria)&quot;, which reached #14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart and a cover of Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot;, which peaked at #67 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==History==
Figures on a Beach was formed in Detroit, Michigan in the early 1980s out of the embers of pioneering electronic group Razor 1922. The band was co-founded by vocalist and keyboardist Anthony Kaczynski and guitarist John &quot;Rik&quot; Rolski, (a.k.a. Ricci Ara in the earliest incarnation of FOAB). With the additions of keyboardist Christopher Ewen and drummer Michael Smith in May 1981, the foundational version of Figures on a Beach was born, to be augmented further by bassist and guitarist Perry Tell, who joined the quartet in 1984. The group released an independent EP, &quot;Swimming&quot; in 1983, the Don Was-produced single &quot;Breathless&quot; in 1984, as well as 1985&#x27;s &quot;Paradise/In Camera Obscura&quot; for Detroit&#x27;s Metro-America label. All of these were collected on a cassette named &quot;Paradise and Other Four-Letter Words&quot; which was released in early 1986.

Figures moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1985 and, after submitting a demo version of &quot;No Stars&quot; to producer Ivan Ivan, was signed by Seymour Stein of Sire Records soon afterward. They released their first full-length album in 1987, titled &quot;Standing on Ceremony&quot;. A self-titled LP (&quot;Figures on a Beach&quot;) followed in 1989, containing a hit cover of Bachman–Turner Overdrive&#x27;s &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet&quot; and a single titled &quot;Accidentally 4th Street (Gloria)&quot;. The group disbanded in late 1992 after soldiering on for a year as a quartet with the departure of Rolski.

Anthony Kaczynski went on to form Fireking, originally with Michael Smith. Fireking has released two albums to date, &quot;Live a Little, Love a Little&quot; in 2001, and the double-album &quot;Double Trouble&quot; in 2015, as well as contributing tracks to tribute albums for Sloan and Matthew Sweet. Kaczynski produced and played on Trusty Sidekick&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;The Friends of Trusty Sidekick&quot;, and also sings seven songs on Gymnasium&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Hansen&#x27;s Pop&#x27;N&#x27;Rock Music &#x27;22&quot;.

Michael Smith, aka Smitt E. Smitty, went on to form Smitt E. Smitty &amp; the Fezztones in 2017, and play drums in Little Billy Lost with Fred Pineau of the Atlantics. Smitt E. Smitty &amp; the Fezztones have released one full album titled &quot;Just a Modern Guy&quot; in 2018, as well as a number of singles, and a number of singles from Little Billy Lost too. Both bands are currently on Rock Garden Records.

As well as carving out a successful career as a DJ in Boston and Cambridge, most notably at beloved nightspot ManRay, Chris Ewen went on to form Future Bible Heroes, a collaboration with Stephin Merritt and Claudia Gonson from The Magnetic Fields. Anthony Kaczynski was brought in to perform Merritt&#x27;s vocals and played guitar and bass on Future Bible Heroes&#x27; 2013 tour in support of their album &quot;Partygoing&quot;, which Merritt opted to skip. Ewen and Kaczynski joined the Magnetic Fields for their 2017 tour for Merritt&#x27;s &quot;50 Song Memoir&quot;. In 2022 they became full members of The Magnetic Fields and toured the USA and Europe, and have continued touring through 2023, with an upcoming European tour scheduled for November 2023, and a tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;69 Love Songs&quot; on tap for 2024.

Michael Smith currently performs with Smitt E. Smitty and the Feztones as well as drumming for Little Billy Lost.

<text>Carnac (; , ) is a commune beside the Gulf of Morbihan on the south coast of Brittany in the Morbihan department in north-western France.

Its inhabitants are called &quot;Carnacois&quot; in French. Carnac is renowned for the Carnac stones – one of the most extensive Neolithic menhir collections in the world – as well as its beaches, which are popular with tourists.

Located on a narrow peninsula halfway between the medieval town Vannes and the seaside resort Quiberon, Carnac is split into two centres: &quot;Carnac-Ville&quot; and &quot;Carnac-Plage&quot; (the beachfront). In total there are five beaches, including &quot;la Grande Plage&quot;, and further to the east, &quot;Plage Men Dû&quot; and &quot;Beaumer&quot;.

==Map==
==Standing stones==

Carnac is famous as the site of more than 10,000 Neolithic standing stones, also known as menhirs. The stones were hewn from local rock and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a Roman legion turned to stone by Pope Cornelius.

The Carnac stones were erected during the Neolithic period which lasted from around 4500 BC until 2000 BC. The precise date of the stones is difficult to ascertain as little dateable material has been found beneath them, but the site&#x27;s main phase of activity is commonly attributed to c. 3300 BC. One interpretation of the site is that successive generations visited the site to erect a stone in honour of their ancestors. A recent suggestion, proposed by Santiago Sevilla, posits that the megaliths were set as protecting shields for an army of defenders of Carnac as a pre-erected burg against attacking enemies.

==History==
In 1864, La Trinité-sur-Mer and its port were separated from the commune to create their own commune and parish. The fishermen found the church in Saint-Cornély to be too far from the port, and had one built in a more convenient location. La Trinité-sur-Mer thus became both a parish and a separate commune.

In 1903, a seaside resort was created on the old salt flats, developing extensively through the 1950s to create the split Carnac of today: Carnac-ville and Carnac-plage. In 1974, a renowned hydrotherapy centre was sponsored by champion cyclist Louison Bobet, retiring after having won the Tour de France three times from 1953 to 1955.

In 1958, the place became a new tourism site to the astonishing direct line of stones and some people speculated that the stones were old graves.

==Tourism==
Since the end of World War II, Carnac has been a popular site for tourists seeking a break from the traditional destinations on the Côte d&#x27;Azur. During the July and August, the number of people in the town increases significantly with tourists and summer residents. The beaches of Brittany are rarely able to offer warm waters on par with those of their southern cousins; however, local factors have ensured that Carnac continues to attract large numbers of visitors. Wind and waves in the region attract day and cruise sailors. The standing stones and other monuments in the vicinity provide a cultural attraction and Carnac-Plage&#x27;s variety of bars and clubs provide entertainment at night.

There are a number of camping grounds in the woods around Carnac, some clustered around lakes such as the &quot;Étang du moulin du lac&quot;, which lies immediately west of the river Crac&#x27;h. Other campsites nearby include Camping le Moulin de Kermaux, Des Menhirs and La Grande Metairie.

&quot;École de Voile de Carnac&quot; provides sailing and windsurfing lessons and rentals to sailors of all levels of experience. The geography of the Bay of Quiberon provides ideal conditions for sailing. The Peninsula of Quiberon provides protection from Atlantic waves and turbulence while allowing the Gulf Winds to enter the bay.

For windsurfers, the Saint-Colomban beach is in Carnac-Plage. The beach is very popular with windsurfers, as its position allows for the best exploitation of strong winds from the west. Other beaches in the area provide equal access to the winds of the bay but windsurfers may find themselves frustrated in the areas of dead air close to their shores.

Other beaches are Bihan Plage, Légenèse Plage, Grande Plage, Beaumer Plage and Men-Du Plage.

As of 2020, 70.6% of the properties were holiday homes, one of the highest percentages in Morbihan.

==Neighbouring communes==
Carnac is connected to La Trinité-sur-Mer to the east by road and by a shared pedestrian-and-bike path along the beach. The other neighbouring communes are Crac&#x27;h, Erdeven, Ploemel and Plouharnel.

==Population==

Inhabitants of Carnac are called &quot;Carnacois&quot; in French.
==Breton language==
In 2008, the municipality launched a linguistic plan and signed an agreement to encourage and facilitate the translation of municipal documents and news materials into the Breton language.

In 2009, 11.03% of children attended bilingual schools in primary education.

<doc id="462957" wikidata="Q1927105" url="?curid=462957" title="Whiskey Ring">
<text>The Whiskey Ring took place from 1871 to 1876 centering in St. Louis during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant. The ring was an American scandal, broken in May 1875, involving the diversion of tax revenues in a conspiracy among government agents, politicians, whiskey distillers, and distributors. Whiskey distillers bribed officials from the U. S. Department of the Treasury to increase profits and evade taxes. Grant&#x27;s Justice Department prosecuted members of Grant&#x27;s own Republican Party who were part of the Ring. The kingpin of the Whiskey Ring was the notorious General John McDonald, whom Grant had appointed Revenue Collector of Missouri District in 1869. Under the leadership of Grant&#x27;s Secretary of Treasury, Benjamin Bristow, a reformer, the Ring was uncovered and broken up.

Prosecutions of members of the Ring started in 1875 and ended in 1876. McDonald was indicted, put on trial, found guilty, fined $5,000, and sentenced to federal prison for 18 months. Grant&#x27;s private Secretary Orville Babcock was indicted, put on trial in St. Louis, but acquitted in February 1876. Grant pardoned McDonald from prison on March 3, 1877, the last full day Grant was in office. In 1880, an angered McDonald authored a salacious book &quot;The Secrets of the Great Whiskey Ring&quot;, in an effort to keep Grant from getting a third term nomination. McDonald also believed Babcock was guilty and had deserved to go to prison with him. How much Grant knew about the Whiskey Ring is a matter of speculation by historians. Three million dollars of stolen tax revenue was recovered by Bristow, with 110 convictions.

==History and formation ==
During the Lincoln Administration, Mid-West whiskey distillers created a slush fund by bribing treasury agents and evading taxes on whiskey they produced and sold. The Whiskey Ring was formed by Republican operatives in 1871 on the pretext to raise money for Republican campaigns. However, Republican campaign contributions were minimal compared to how much was pocketed by the ring itself. Distilleries and leaders of the ring received between $45,000 and $60,000 each. By the mid-1870s, during the Ulysses S. Grant administration, the illegal cartel had organized into an efficient machine of whiskey distillers who kept Treasury agents in line by aggressive tactics. By 1873, the ring had become a purely criminal crime syndicate. The whiskey syndicate involved distillers, government officials, rectifiers, gaugers, storekeepers, and internal revenue agents. Due to the increase of liquor taxes after the Civil War, whiskey was supposed to be taxed at 70 cents per gallon. However, distillers would instead pay the officials 35 cents per gallon, and the illicit whiskey was stamped as having the tax paid. Before they were caught, a group of politicians was able to siphon off millions of dollars in federal taxes. In St. Louis, the ring was led by Missouri Revenue Collector John McDonald, appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant, in 1869. McDonald coordinated with Grant&#x27;s private secretary, Orville Babcock, in Washington D.C. to keep the ring hidden and prevent it being exposed.

===Investigations===
On June 4, 1874, Benjamin Bristow was appointed to Secretary of Treasury by Ulysses S. Grant. Bristow, an ambitious Kentuckian, was zealous for reform and wanted to make a name for himself. Grant&#x27;s appointment of Bristow was popular among reformers. In December 1874, Bristow wanted to send a team of investigators to St. Louis to look into the Whiskey Ring. This attempt was thwarted by Orville Babcock, Grant&#x27;s private secretary, who persuaded Commissioner of Internal Revenue J.W. Douglass to revoke the order. Bristow and Bluford Wilson, Solicitor of the Treasury, were undeterred and sought an independent way to investigate the ring. An effort to break up Treasury Supervisors and move them to different cities proved unpractical and unsuccessful. George Fishback, the proprietor of the St. Louis Democrat, gave Bristow and Wilson an informant to investigate the Ring and uncover illegal activity. Wilson added other agents. The secret investigators reported to Bristow evidence of a massive ring of conspirators between revenue agents and distillers. Whiskey was labeled as vinegar, or falsely recorded at a lower proof, while revenue stamps were used over and over again. The cheating cost the Treasury millions of dollars.

In mid-April 1875, Bristow gave Grant evidence of the ring. Grant left Washington to attend Centennial commemorations of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Hearing rumors of impending raids by Bristow, Supervisor of Internal Revenue John McDonald, of Saint Louis, went to Washington D.C. With the evidence presented against him, McDonald broke down and confessed to Bristow. McDonald resigned on April 23 and returned to St. Louis. When Grant returned Bristow informed him of the full operations of the ring. Bristow urged Grant to fire Commissioner of Internal Revenue J.W. Douglas for criminal negligence. Grant complied and replaced Douglas with Daniel Pratt of Indiana.

==Prosecutions (1875-1876)==

On Monday, May 10, 1875, Bristow conducted a series of raids across the nation that broke up the Whiskey Ring. The trials began at Jefferson City, Missouri in October 1875. Ultimately, of 238 people who were indicted, 110 convictions were made and more than $3 million in taxes were recovered. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed General John Brooks Henderson (a former U.S. Senator from Missouri) to serve as special prosecutor in charge of the indictments and trials, but Grant eventually fired Gen. Henderson for challenging Grant&#x27;s interference in the prosecutions. There was also some animosity between Grant and Henderson, because Senator Henderson, in 1868, voted to acquit President Andrew Johnson, saving Johnson from impeachment by one vote. Grant replaced Henderson with an attorney James Broadhead. The ringleader John McDonald, was indicted, tried by Henderson and United States Attorney of the Eastern District of Missouri, David P. Dyer. McDonald was convicted, fined $5,000, and sentenced to prison for 18 months. Revenue agent John A. Joyce, was indicted, tried, convicted, and sent to the penitentiary.

===Orville Babcock&#x27;s indictment===
In July 1875, Bristow and Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont, working as Grant&#x27;s anti-corruption team, met Grant, who was vacationing at Long Branch, and gave him evidence that Babcock was a member of the ring. Grant told Pierrepont &quot;Let no guilty man escape...&quot; and said if Babcock was guilty then it was the &quot;greatest piece of traitorism to me that a man could possibly practice.&quot; In October, Babcock was summoned in front of Grant, Bristow, and Pierrepont at the White House to explain two ambiguous telegrams handwritten by Babcock and signed &quot;Sylph&quot;, an apparent code name for Babcock. The first message said, &quot;&quot;I have succeeded. They will not go. I will write you.&quot; (December 10, 1874) and the second one said, &quot;We have official information that the enemy weakens. Push things.&quot;&quot; (February 3, 1875) Bristow had shown these messages to Grant at a cabinet meeting the same day. Babcock said something to Grant, unintelligible to Bristow and Pierrepont, and Grant appeared satisfied by Babcock&#x27;s interpretation of the telegrams.

Pierrepont and Bristow, believing the matter to be crucial, insisted Babcock send a message to his telegraphic correspondent demanding that this individual come to Washington to give his version of the messages. After Babcock seemed to be taking too long, Pierrepont went to check on him and found Babcock writing a warning to revenue agent John A. Joyce, his St. Louis confederate, to be on his guard. Infuriated, Pierrepont grabbed Babcock&#x27;s pen and dashed through his message yelling &quot;You don&#x27;t want to send your argument; send the fact, and go there and make your explanation. &quot;I&quot; do not understand it.&quot; Grant, on the other hand, was divided between the loyalty he had for Babcock, and his desire for Bristow and Pierrepont, trustworthy members of his cabinet, to prosecute the Whiskey Ring. Since Babcock had no acceptable explanation for his messages, he was indicted for conspiracy to defraud the Treasury of the United States on November 4, 1875.

===Orville Babcock&#x27;s trial===

On February 8, 1876, Babcock went on trial, an event that lasted eighteen days. Babcock&#x27;s defense team was noted for its prowess and included Grant&#x27;s former Attorney General George Williams, a top criminal defense advocate and lawyer, Emory A. Storrs, and a former appeals judge (New York), John K. Porter. It took place at the U.S. Post Office and Customs House located at 218 North Third Street, and the status of the defendant made the trial a popular and well-attended spectacle. Demand to attend the proceedings was so great that only persons with signed passes and Whiskey Ring defendants were allowed in. Babcock arrived in civilian clothes, including sky-blue pants, a silk hat, and a light jacket. When court was not in session, Babcock stayed at the newly rebuilt Lindell Hotel on Sixth Street and Washington Avenue.

Grant&#x27;s White House deposition took place on February 12; it was notarized by Chief Justice Morrison Waite and witnessed by both Bristow and Pierrepont. In his statement, Grant fully supported the Whiskey Ring prosecutions, but willfully refused to testify against Babcock, despite having been informed by Bristow of Babcock&#x27;s duplicity. Instead, Grant praised Babcock, saying he had &quot;great confidence&quot; in Babcock&#x27;s integrity, and that his confidence in Babcock was &quot;unshaken&quot;.

On February 17, Babcock&#x27;s defense counsel read President Grant&#x27;s deposition to the jury, which severely weakened any chance of Babcock being convicted. The same day, General William T. Sherman testified that Babcock&#x27;s &quot;character has been very good.&quot; Grant&#x27;s deposition, Sherman&#x27;s in-person testimony, and the evidence presented by Babcock&#x27;s shrewd defense counsel led to his acquittal on February 25. A rumor spread that Pierrepont had leaked information to Babcock that aided in his acquittal, but Pierrepont denied this and suggested that Babcock himself had started the rumor. A few months later Grant&#x27;s appointed anti-corruption team broke up. Pierrepont resigned from office on May 21, 1876, and was appointed by Grant United States Minister to the United Kingdom on July 11, 1876. Enmity between Grant and Bristow forced Bristow out of the cabinet, and he resigned on June 20, 1876.

==Effect on Republican Party==
The Whiskey Ring was seen by many as a sign of corruption under the Republican governments that took power across the nation following the American Civil War. However, Grant&#x27;s appointment, Bristow, was a hero among reformers. Babcock, the private secretary to the President, was indicted as a member of the ring. He was acquitted through the personal intervention and testimony of President Grant. Newspapers at the time were known to slant toward a Republican agenda, making light of the trial. This led many people to think the Whiskey Ring was a ploy for the Republican party to increase their funds. For this reason, President Grant, although not directly involved in the ring, came to be seen as emblematic of Republican corruption, and later scandals involving his Secretary of War William W. Belknap only confirmed that perception. The Whiskey Ring, along with other alleged abuses of power by the Republican party, contributed to a national weariness of Reconstruction, which ended Grant&#x27;s presidency with the Compromise of 1877.

==&quot;Sylph&quot;==
According to John McDonald, the kingpin of the Whiskey Ring, there was much public interest and speculation of the &quot;Sylph&quot; letter signature. McDonald said that when Babcock had attended the annual St. Louis Fair, with Col. John A. Joyce, while they were walking on 5th Street, he saw a very attractive woman, who would be nicknamed the &quot;Sylph&quot; for her beauty. Although Babcock was a married man, he inquired who the lady was. Babcock reportedly said to Joyce, &quot;She is the most beautiful and bewitching woman I ever saw; for heaven&#x27;s sake; let us turn the corner and meet her again so that you can give me an introduction.&quot;. Later, meeting at Freund&#x27;s restaurant, Babcock was introduced to Louise Hawkins, the &quot;Sylph&quot;. Babcock would later use &quot;Sylph&quot;, as a code signature for Babcock, in letter correspondence to Joyce.

<doc id="462966" wikidata="Q15839081" url="?curid=462966" title="West Country English">
<text>West Country English is a group of English language varieties and accents used by much of the native population of the West Country, an area found in the southwest of England.

The West Country is often defined as encompassing the official region of South West England: Cornwall, and the counties of, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Wiltshire, Bristol and Gloucestershire. However, the exact northern and eastern boundaries of the area are hard to define. In the adjacent counties of Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Hampshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire, it is possible to encounter similar accents and indeed, much the same distinct dialect, albeit with some similarities to others in neighbouring regions. Although natives of all these locations, especially in rural parts, often still have West Country influences in their speech, their increased mobility and urbanisation has meant that in the more populous of these counties the dialect itself, as opposed to the people&#x27;s various local &quot;accents&quot;, is becoming increasingly rare.

Academically the regional variations are considered to be dialectal forms. The &quot;Survey of English Dialects&quot; captured manners of speech across the South West region that were just as different from Standard English as any from the far North of England. There is some influence from the Welsh and Cornish languages depending on the specific location.

==In literature, film and television==
In literary contexts, most of the usage has been in either poetry or dialogue, to add local colour. It has rarely been used for serious prose in recent times but was used much more extensively until the 19th century. West Country dialects are commonly represented as &quot;Mummerset&quot;, a kind of catch-all southern rural accent invented for broadcasting.

===Early period===
* The Late West Saxon dialect was the standard literary language of later Anglo-Saxon England, and consequently the majority of Anglo-Saxon literature, including the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; and the poetic Biblical paraphrase &quot;Judith&quot;, is preserved in West Saxon dialect, though not all of it was originally written in West Saxon.
* In the medieval period, &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; (13th century) is a notable example of a work in the dialect.
* The Cornish language (and Breton) descended from the ancient British language (Brythonic/Brittonic) that was spoken all over what is now the West Country until the West Saxons conquered and settled most of the area. The Cornish language throughout much of the High Middle Ages was not just the vernacular but the prestigious language in Cornwall among all classes, but was also spoken in large areas of Devon well after the Norman conquest. Cornish began to decline after the Late Middle Ages with English expanding westwards, and after the Prayer Book Rebellion, suffered terminal decline, dying out in the 18th century. (Its existence today is a revival).

===17th century===
* In &quot;King Lear&quot;, Edgar speaks in the West Country dialect, as one of his various personae.
* Both Sir Francis Drake and Sir Walter Raleigh were noted at the Court of Queen Elizabeth for their strong Devon accents.

===18th century===
* &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1749) by Henry Fielding, set in Somerset, again mainly dialogue. Considered one of the first true English novels.

===19th century===
* William Barnes&#x27; Dorset dialect poetry (1801–1886).
*Walter Hawken Tregellas (1831–1894), author of many stories written in the local dialect of the county of Cornwall and a number of other works.
* Anthony Trollope&#x27;s (1815–1882) series of books &quot;Chronicles of Barsetshire&quot; (1855–1867) also use some dialect in dialogue.
* The novels of Thomas Hardy (1840–1928) often use the dialect in dialogue, notably &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot; (1891).
* &quot;Wiltshire Rhymes and Tales in the Wiltshire Dialect&quot; (1894) and other works by Edward Slow.
* The Gilbert and Sullivan operetta &quot;The Sorcerer&quot; is set in the fictional village of Ploverleigh in Somerset. Some dialogue and song lyrics, especially for the chorus, are a phonetic approximation of West Country speech. &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; and &quot;Ruddigore&quot; are both set in Cornwall.
* John Davey a farmer from Zennor, records the native Cornish language Cranken Rhyme.
* R. D. Blackmore&#x27;s &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;. According to Blackmore, he relied on a &quot;phonogogic&quot; style for his characters&#x27; speech, emphasizing their accents and word formation. He expended great effort, in all of his novels, on his characters&#x27; dialogues and dialects, striving to recount realistically not only the ways, but also the tones and accents, in which thoughts and utterances were formed by the various sorts of people who lived in the Exmoor district.

===20th century===
* &#x27;Zummerzet speech&#x27; is discussed in &quot;The Somerset Coast&quot; (1909) by Charles George Harper.
* &quot;Songs of the Soil&quot; by Percy G Stone, verse in Isle of Wight dialect, rendered phonetically, showing similarities with &#x27;core&#x27; West Country dialects. 
* &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; (1933) by John Cowper Powys (1872–1963) contains dialogue written in imitation of the local Somerset dialect.
* Albert John Coles, (1876–1965), writing as Jan Stewer, wrote 3,000 short stories in the Devonshire dialect for local Devon newspapers, and published collections of them, as well as performing them widely on stage, film, and broadcast.
* David Foot (1929–2021) wrote often about the West Country. &quot;Footsteps from East Coker&quot; was about his childhood village and beyond.
* Laurie Lee&#x27;s (1914–1997) works such as &quot;Cider with Rosie&quot; (1959) portray a somewhat idealised Gloucestershire childhood in the Five Valleys area.
* John Fowles&#x27;s &quot;Daniel Martin&quot;, which features the title character&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s dialect.
* Dennis Potter&#x27;s &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; is a television play about children in the Forest of Dean during the Second World War. The dialogue is written in the style of the Forest dialect.
* The songs of Adge Cutler (from Nailsea, died 1974) were famous for their West Country dialect, sung in a strong Somerset accent. His legacy lives on in the present day Wurzels and other so-called &quot;Scrumpy and Western&quot; artists.
* The folk group The Yetties perform songs composed in the dialect of Dorset (they originate from Yetminster).
* Andy Partridge, lead singer with the group XTC, has a pronounced Wiltshire accent. Although more noticeable in his speech, his accent may also be heard in some of his singing.
* J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fantasy novels feature Hagrid, a character who has a West Country accent.
* Berk, the central monster character from &quot;The Trap Door&quot;, voiced by actor and comedian Willie Rushton.
* Archaeologist Phil Harding from Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; speaks with a strong Wiltshire accent.

==History and origins==
Until the 19th century, the West Country and its dialects were largely protected from outside influences, due to its relative geographical isolation. While standard English derives from the Old English Mercian dialects, the West Country dialects derive from the West Saxon dialect, which formed the earliest English language standard. Thomas Spencer Baynes claimed in 1856 that, due to its position at the heart of the Kingdom of Wessex, the relics of Anglo-Saxon accent, idiom and vocabulary were best preserved in the Somerset dialect.

The dialects have their origins in the expansion of Old English into the west of modern-day England, where the kingdom of Wessex (West-Saxons) had been founded in the 6th century. As the Kings of Wessex became more powerful they enlarged their kingdom westwards and north-westwards by taking territory from the British kingdoms in those districts. From Wessex, the Anglo-Saxons spread into the Celtic regions of present-day Devon, Somerset and Gloucestershire, bringing their language with them. At a later period, Cornwall came under Wessex influence, which appears to become more extensive after the time of Athelstan in the 10th century. However, the spread of the English language took much longer here than elsewhere.

Outside Cornwall, it is believed that the various local dialects reflect the territories of various West Saxon tribes, who had their own dialects
which fused together into a national language in the later Anglo-Saxon period.

As Lt-Col. J. A. Garton observed in 1971, traditional Somerset English has a venerable and respectable origin, and is not a mere &quot;debasement&quot; of Standard English:

In some cases, many of these forms are closer to modern Saxon (commonly called Low German/Low Saxon) than Standard British English is, e.g.
The use of masculine and sometimes feminine, rather than neuter, pronouns with non-animate referents also parallels Low German, which unlike English retains grammatical genders. The pronunciation of &quot;s&quot; as &quot;z&quot; is also similar to Low German. However, recent research proposes that some syntactical features of English, including the unique forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot;, originate rather with the Brythonic languages. (See &quot;Celtic language influence&quot; below.)

In more recent times, West Country dialects have been treated with some derision, which has led many local speakers to abandon them or water them down. In particular it is British comedy which has brought them to the fore outside their native regions, and paradoxically groups such as The Wurzels, a comic North Somerset/Bristol band from whom the term Scrumpy and Western music originated, have both popularised and made fun of them simultaneously. In an unusual regional breakout, the Wurzels&#x27; song &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot; reached the top of the UK charts in 1976, where it did nothing to dispel the &quot;simple farmer&quot; stereotype of Somerset and West Country folk. It and all their songs are sung entirely in a local version of the dialect, which is somewhat exaggerated and distorted. Some words used aren&#x27;t even typical of the local dialect. For instance, the word &quot;nowt&quot; is used in the song &quot;Threshing Machine&quot;. This word is generally used in more northern parts of England, with the West Country equivalent being &quot;nawt&quot;.

===Celtic-language influence===

Although the English language gradually spread into Cornwall after approximately the 13th century, a complete language shift to English took centuries more. The linguistic boundary between English in the east and Cornish in the west shifted markedly in the county between 1300 and 1750 (see figure). This is not to be thought of as a sharp boundary, and it should not be inferred that there were no Cornish speakers to the east of the line and no English speakers to the west. Nor should it be inferred that the boundary suddenly moved a great distance every 50 years.

During the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549, which centred on Devon and Cornwall, many of the Cornish objected to the Book of Common Prayer, on the basis that many Cornish could not speak English. Cornish probably ceased to be spoken as a community language sometime around 1780, with the last monoglot Cornish speaker believed to be Chesten Marchant, who died in 1676 at Gwithian (Dolly Pentreath was bilingual). However, some people retained a fragmented knowledge and some words were adopted by dialect(s) in Cornwall.

In recent years, the traffic has reversed, with the revived Cornish language reclaiming Cornish words that had been preserved in the local dialect into its lexicon, and also (especially &quot;Revived Late Cornish&quot;) borrowing other dialect words. However, there has been some controversy over whether all of these words are of native origin, as opposed to imported from parts of England, or the Welsh Marches. Some modern-day revived Cornish speakers have been known to use Cornish words within an English sentence, and even those who are not speakers of the language sometimes use words from the language in names.

Brythonic languages have also had a long-term influence on the West Country dialects beyond Cornwall, both as a substrate (certain West Country dialect words and possibly grammatical features) and languages of contact. Recent research on the roots of English proposes that the extent of Brythonic syntactic influence on Old English and Middle English may have been underestimated, specifically citing the preponderance of forms of the verbs &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;to do&quot; in South West England and their grammatical similarity to the Welsh and Cornish forms as opposed to the forms in other Germanic languages.

Bos: Cornish verb to be
The Cornish dialect, or Anglo-Cornish (to avoid confusion with the Cornish language), has the most substantial Celtic language influence because many western parts were non-English speaking even into the early modern period. In places such as Mousehole, Newlyn and St Ives, fragments of Cornish survived in English even into the 20th century, e.g. some numerals (especially for counting fish) and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer were noted by W. D. Watson in 1925, Edwin Norris collected the Creed in 1860, and J. H. Nankivel also recorded numerals in 1865. The dialect of West Penwith is particularly distinctive, especially in terms of grammar. This is most likely due to the late decay of the Cornish language in this area. In Cornwall the following places were included in the Survey of English Dialects: Altarnun, Egloshayle, Gwinear, Kilkhampton, Mullion, St Buryan, and St Ewe.

In other areas, Celtic vocabulary is less common; some possible examples of Brythonic words surviving in the Devon dialect include:
* Goco — A bluebell
* Jonnick — Pleasant, agreeable

==Characteristics==
===Phonology===
* West Country accents are rhotic like most Canadian, American, Irish and Scottish accents, meaning that the historical loss of non-syllable-final /r/ did not take place, in contrast to non-rhotic accents like Received Pronunciation. Often, this is specifically realised as the retroflex approximant , which is typically lengthened at the ends of words. This rhoticity can be attributed to the relative isolation of the South West from the rest of England. Rhoticity appears to be declining in both real and apparent time in some areas of the West Country, for example Dorset.
* , as in &quot;guide&quot; or &quot;life&quot;, more precisely approaches , , or .
* , as in &quot;house&quot; or &quot;cow&quot;, more precisely approaches or , with even very front and unrounded variants such as .
* Word-final &quot;-ing&quot; in polysyllabic words is typically realised as .
* , as in &quot;trap&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;, is often open , the more open variant is fairly common in urban areas but especially common in rural areas.
** The split associated with London English may not exist for some speakers or may exist marginally based simply on a length difference. In other words, some may not have any contrast between and , for example making &quot;palm&quot; and &quot;Pam&quot; homophones (though some pronounce the in &quot;palm&quot;). For some West Country speakers, the vowel is even the same in the , , , and word sets: . The split&#x27;s &quot;bath&quot; vowel (appearing as the letter &quot;a&quot; in such other words as &quot;grass&quot;, &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;path&quot;, etc.) can also be represented by the sounds or in different parts of the West Country (RP has in such words); the isoglosses in the &quot;Linguistic Atlas of England&quot; are not straightforward cases of clear borders. Short vowels have also been reported, e.g., .
* h-dropping: initial can often be omitted so &quot;hair&quot; and &quot;air&quot; become homophones. This is common in working-class speech in most parts of England.
* t-glottalisation: use of the glottal stop as an allophone of , generally when in any syllable-final position.
* The word-final letter &quot;y&quot; is pronounced or ; for example: &quot;party &quot;, &quot;silly &quot; etc.
* The Survey of English Dialects found that Cornwall retained some older features of speech that are now considered &quot;Northern&quot; in England. For example, a close in &quot;suck, but, cup&quot;, etc. and sometimes a short in words such as &quot;aunt&quot;.
* Initial fricative consonants can be voiced, particularly in more traditional and older speakers, so that &quot;s&quot; is pronounced as Standard English &quot;z&quot; and &quot;f&quot; as Standard English &quot;v&quot;. This feature is now exceedingly rare.
* In words containing &quot;r&quot; before a vowel, there is frequent metathesis – &quot;gurt&quot; (great), &quot;Burdgwater&quot; (Bridgwater) and &quot;chillurn&quot; (children)
* &quot;l&quot; sounds are vocalised (pronounced like &quot;w&quot;) when not followed by a vowel, so &quot;all old people&quot; is .
**As a result, the &quot;fool-fall&quot; merger is common, with both pronounced .
* In Bristol, a terminal &quot;a&quot; can be realised as the sound  – e.g. &quot;cinema&quot; as &quot;cinemaw&quot; and &quot;America&quot; as &quot;Americaw&quot; – which is often perceived by non-Bristolians to be an intrusive &quot;l&quot;, known as the &quot;Bristol l&quot;. Hence the old joke about the three Bristolian sisters Evil, Idle and Normali.e.: Eva, Ida, and Norma. The name &quot;Bristol&quot; itself (originally &quot;Bridgestowe&quot; or &quot;Bristow&quot;) is often claimed to have originated from this local pronunciation, though this is contested.

===Vocabulary===

* Some of the vocabulary used relates to English words of a bygone era, e.g. the verb &quot;to hark&quot; (as in &quot;&#x27;ark a&#x27;ee&quot;), &quot;thee&quot; (often abbreviated to &quot;&#x27;ee&quot;), the increased use of the infinitive form of the verb &quot;to be&quot; etc.
Some of these terms are obsolete, but some are in current use.
Some dialect words now appear mainly, or solely, in place names, such as &quot;batch&quot; (North Somerset, = hill but more commonly applied to Coalmine spoil heaps e.g. Camerton batch, Farrington batch, Braysdown batch), &quot;tyning&quot;, &quot;hoe&quot; (a bay). The suffix &quot;-coombe&quot; is quite commonly used in West Country place names (not so much in Cornwall), and means &quot;valley&quot;.

===Grammar===
* The second person singular &quot;thee&quot; (or &quot;ye&quot;) and &quot;thou&quot; forms used, &quot;thee&quot; often contracted to&quot; &#x27;ee&quot;.
* &quot;Bist&quot; may be used instead of &quot;are&quot; for the second person, e.g.: &quot;how bist?&quot; (&quot;how are you?&quot;) This has its origins in the Old English – or Anglo-Saxon – language; compare the modern German (a literal translation of &quot;How are you?&quot;, not used as a greeting).
* Use of masculine (rather than neuter) pronouns with non-animate referents, e.g.: &quot;put&#x27;ee over there&quot; (&quot;put it over there&quot;) and &quot;″e&#x27;s a nice scarf&quot; (&quot;That&#x27;s a nice scarf&quot;).
* An &quot;a-&quot; prefix may be used to denote the past participle; &quot;a-went&quot; (&quot;gone&quot;).
* Use of &quot;they&quot; in conjunction with plural nouns, where Standard English demands &quot;those&quot; e.g.: &quot;They shoes are mine&quot; (&quot;Those shoes are mine&quot; / &quot;They are mine&quot;). This is also used in Modern Scots but differentiated &quot;thae&quot; meaning those and &quot;thay&quot; the plural of &quot;he&quot;, &quot;she &quot;and &quot;it&quot;, both from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;þā&quot; &#x27;they/those&#x27;, the plural form of &#x27;he/that&#x27;, &#x27;she/that&#x27; and &quot;þæt&quot; &#x27;it/that&#x27;.
* In other areas, &quot;be&quot; may be used exclusively in the present tense, often in the present continuous; &quot;Where be you going to?&quot; (&quot;Where are you going?&quot;)
* The use of &quot;to&quot; to denote location. &quot;Where&#x27;s that to?&quot; (&quot;Where&#x27;s that [at]?&quot;). This is something that can still be heard often, unlike many other characteristics. This former usage is common to Newfoundland English, where many of the island&#x27;s modern-day descendants have West Country origins — particularly Bristol — as a result of the 17th–19th century migratory fishery.
*Use of the past tense &quot;writ&quot; where Standard English uses &quot;wrote&quot;. e.g.: &quot;I writ a letter&quot; (&quot;I wrote a letter&quot;).
*Nominative pronouns as indirect objects. For instance, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell I, tell&#x27;ee!&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t tell me, tell him!&quot;), &quot;&#x27;ey give I fifty quid and I zay no, giv&#x27;ee to charity inztead&quot; (&quot;They gave me £50 and I said no, give it to charity instead&quot;). When in casual Standard English the oblique case is used, in the West Country dialect the object of many a verb takes the nominative case.

==Social stigma and future of the dialect==
Owing to the West Country&#x27;s agricultural history, the West Country accent has for centuries been associated with farming, and consequently with a lack of education and rustic simplicity. This can be seen in literature as early as the 18th century, for instance in Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s play &quot;The Rivals&quot;, set in the Somerset city of Bath.

As more and more of the English population moved into towns and cities during the 20th century, non-regional, Standard English accents increasingly became a marker of personal social mobility. Universal primary education was also an important factor as it made it possible for some to move out of their rural environments into situations where other modes of speech were current.

A West Country accent continues to be a reason for denigration and stereotype:
In the early part of the twentieth century, the journalist and writer Albert John Coles used the pseudonym Jan Stewer (a character from the folk song Widecombe Fair) to pen a long-running series of humorous articles and correspondences in Devon dialect for the &quot;Western Morning News&quot;. These now preserve a record of the dialect as recalled with affection in the period. The tales perpetuate – albeit sympathetically – the rustic uneducated stereotype as the protagonist experiences the modern world.

There is a popular prejudice that stereotypes speakers as unsophisticated and even backward, due possibly to the deliberate and lengthened nature of the accent. This can work to the West Country speaker&#x27;s advantage, however: recent studies of how trustworthy Britons find their fellows based on their regional accents put the West Country accent high up, under southern Scottish English but a long way above Cockney and Scouse. Recent polls put the West Country accent as third and fifth most attractive in the British Isles respectively.

The West Country accent is probably most represented in film as &quot;pirate speech&quot;that cartoon-like &quot;Ooh arr, me &#x27;earties! Sploice the mainbrace!&quot; way of talking is very similar. This may be a result of the strong (both legal and outlawed) seafaring and fisherman tradition of the West Country. Edward Teach (Blackbeard) was a native of Bristol, and privateer and English hero Sir Francis Drake hailed from Tavistock in Devon. Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; may also have added to the association. West Country native Robert Newton&#x27;s performance in the 1950 Disney film &quot;Treasure Island&quot; is credited with popularising the stereotypical West Country &quot;pirate voice&quot;. Newton&#x27;s strong West Country accent also featured in &quot;Blackbeard the Pirate&quot; (1952).

<doc id="462968" wikidata="Q1294065" url="?curid=462968" title="Edward Whelan (Canadian politician)">
<text>Edward Whelan (1824 – December 10, 1867) was one of Prince Edward Island&#x27;s delegates to the Québec Conference and one of the Fathers of the Canadian Confederation. Whelan was also a journalist, orator and advocate for responsible government.

==Early years==
Edward Whelan was born in 1824 in Ballina, County Mayo, in Ireland. At seven years old, he and his family moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1831. Growing up in Halifax, he was greatly influenced by Joseph Howe, where he worked as a printing apprentice, as well as Father Richard Baptist O&#x27;Brien, a dynamic Irish priest who was a gifted orator as well as Whelan&#x27;s teacher at St. Mary&#x27;s School in Halifax. These two influences led Whelan to abandon his studies at the age of 18 to take up a position as editor of &quot;The Register&quot;, an Irish-Catholic, Liberal newspaper.

==Journalism career==

Edward Whelan was a Canadian journalist who worked for a newspaper known as &quot;The Register&quot; whose target audience was Irish Roman Catholics.

==Political career==
In August 1846, Whelan was elected as an assemblyman for St. Peters in Kings County. He remained an assemblyman until the last year of his life but had sporadic attendance. Critics of Whelan point out that his political voice lacked the passion and genius that was apparent in his printed work.

In the fall of 1846, Whelan sought to embark on yet another newspaper venture, namely the &quot;Examiner&quot;. This publication nearly failed, but he managed to keep it going.

Whelan then devoted much of 1850 to speak at meetings regarding the concept of responsible government. This led to Whelan&#x27;s rise in stature and in April 1851, Whelan was named to the Executive Council and also appointed the Queen&#x27;s Printer.

Within this new government role, Whelan spent much of his time defending the major Liberal reforms regarding the Free Education Act, extension of the franchise, and the Land Purchase Act. These Liberal reforms were not without controversy, and Whelan took the brunt of the criticism.

===Confederation===
In 1864, the union of the British North American colonies was the topic of the day. Though the Liberals were against confederation, Whelan supported confederation as he saw it as an opportunity for PEI to gain more control of its own affairs. Whelan was chosen to be one of the delegates to the Quebec Conference. Attending this conference made Whelan an even stronger proponent. Despite his advocacy, few politicians and residents were persuaded and Whelan became disillusioned.

==End of political career==

Whelan&#x27;s stance on Confederation as well as other issues, led him to become isolated within the Liberal party. In the election of 1867, Whelan was defeated for the first time in 21 years. There is no single cause for his defeat. He had lost support from his traditional supporters by denouncing the Tenant League and Fenianism. Moreover, his support of Confederation was unpopular with the people of PEI. On all three of these issues, his opponent, Edward Reilly, had the edge.

However, Whelan believed that the defeat came from the disapproval of the newly appointed cleric of St. Peters, Father William Phelan, a supporter of Reilly. Whelan felt that the clergy had unduly influenced the election.

Whelan felt very bitter about this defeat and by the autumn of 1867 his health slowly got worse. Whelan died on December 10, 1867.

<doc id="462969" wikidata="Q1365233" url="?curid=462969" title="Hogtie">
<text>The hogtie is a method of tying the limbs together, rendering the subject immobile and helpless. Originally, it was applied to pigs (hence the name) and other young four-legged animals.

== Agriculture uses ==
The hogtie when used on pigs and cattle has it where three of the four limbs are tied together, as tying all four together is difficult and can result in harm to the animal. 

== Human uses ==
When performed on a human, a hogtie is any position that results in the arms and legs being bound, both tied behind the person and then connecting the hands and feet. The practice has been called inhumane.

Typically, the person&#x27;s feet are restrained with legcuffs or similar devices, and handcuffed with the hands behind the back. The feet are pulled behind the person, until the hands and feet can be connected. (The head and neck are left free.) The restrained person is then placed on the stomach, in a face-down prone position, which decreases the risk of the restrained person kicking nearby people or objects, or hurting themselves by pounding their heads against nearby objects, but which also increases the risk of positional restraint asphyxia (a restraint-specific form of positional asphyxia). 

Hogtying, also called the &quot;prone maximal restraint position&quot; or the &quot;hobble position&quot;, may make it somewhat more difficult for some people to breathe, especially after physical activity. Frequently, hog-tying has been performed on a person who has been violently resisting. Various mechanisms for sudden death while hogtied have been proposed, ranging from changes in chest movement from being handcuffed, to drug use, to pre-existing medical conditions such as obesity or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, to police and medical personnel using their body weight to compress both the chest and abdomen in the process of applying the restraint devices. Concerns about the restrained person dying have led to many US police departments discontinuing the practice of hogtying people.

<doc id="462975" wikidata="Q507462" url="?curid=462975" title="Yorkshire dialect">
<text>Yorkshire dialect, also known as Yorkshire English, Broad Yorkshire, Tyke, or Yorkie, is a grouping of several regionally neighbouring dialects of English spoken in the Yorkshire area of Northern England. The varieties have roots in Old English and are influenced to a greater extent by Old Norse than Standard English is. Yorkshire experienced drastic dialect levelling in the 20th century, eroding many traditional features, though variation and even innovations persist, at both the regional and sub-regional levels. Organisations such as the Yorkshire Dialect Society and the East Riding Dialect Society exist to promote the survival of the more traditional features.

The dialects have been represented in classic works of literature such as &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;, and linguists have documented variations of the dialects since the 19th century. In the mid-20th century, the Survey of English Dialects collected dozens of recordings of authentic Yorkshire dialects.

== Early history and written accounts ==
Based on fragments of early studies on the dialect, there seem to have been few distinctions across large areas: in the early 14th century, the traditional Northumbrian dialect of Yorkshire showed few differences compared to the dialect spoken in Aberdeen, now often considered a separate Scots language. The dialect has been widely studied since the 19th century, including an early work by William Stott Banks in 1865 on the dialect of Wakefield, and another by Joseph Wright who used an early form of phonetic notation in a description of the dialect of Windhill, near Bradford. Significant works that covered all of England include Alexander John Ellis&#x27;s 1899 book On Early English Pronunciation, Part V, and the English Dialect Dictionary, which was published in six volumes between 1898 and 1905.

Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1839) and Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1847) are notable 19th century works of literature which include examples of contemporary Yorkshire dialects. The following is an excerpt of Brontë&#x27;s use of contemporary West Riding dialect from Haworth in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, with a translation to standard English below:&quot;&#x27;Aw wonder how yah can faishion to stand thear i&#x27; idleness un war, when all on &#x27;ems goan out! Bud yah&#x27;re a nowt, and it&#x27;s no use talking—yah&#x27;ll niver mend o&#x27;yer ill ways, but goa raight to t&#x27; divil, like yer mother afore ye!&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;I wonder how you can dare to stand there in idleness and worse, when all of them have gone out! But you&#x27;re a nobody, and it&#x27;s no use talking—you&#x27;ll never mend your evil ways, but go straight to the Devil, like your mother before you!

== Geographic distribution ==
Yorkshire covers a large area, and the dialect is not the same in all areas. In fact, the dialects of the North and East Ridings are fairly different from that of the West Riding, as they display only Northumbrian characteristics rather than the mixture of Northumbrian &amp; Mercian features found in the West Riding. The Yorkshire Dialect Society draws a border roughly at the River Wharfe between two main zones. The area southwest of the river has been influenced by Mercian, originating from the East Midlands dialects during the industrial revolution, whilst that to the northeast, like Geordie, the Cumbrian dialect and the Scots language, is descended more purely from the Northumbrian dialect. The distinction was first made by A. J. Ellis in &quot;On Early English Pronunciation&quot;. The division was approved of by Joseph Wright, the founder of the Yorkshire Dialect Society and the author of the &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot;. Investigations at village level by the dialect analysts Stead (1906), Sheard (1945) and Rohrer (1950) mapped a border between the two areas. A rough border between the two areas was mapped by the Swiss linguist Fritz Rohrer, having undertaken village-based research in areas indicated by previous statements by Richard Stead and J.A. Sheard, although there were &quot;buffer areas&quot; in which a mixed dialect was used, such as a large area between Leeds and Ripon, and also at Whitgift, near Goole.

One report explains the geographic difference in detail:This distinction was first recognised formally at the turn of the 19th / 20th centuries, when linguists drew an isophone diagonally across the county from the northwest to the southeast, separating these two broadly distinguishable ways of speaking. It can be extended westwards through Lancashire to the estuary of the River Lune, and is sometimes called the Humber-Lune Line. Strictly speaking, the dialects spoken south and west of this isophone are Midland dialects, whereas the dialects spoken north and east of it are truly Northern. It is likely that the Midland influence came up into the region with people migrating towards the manufacturing districts of the West Riding during the Industrial Revolution.

Over time, speech has become closer to Standard English and some of the features that once distinguished one town from another have disappeared. In 1945, J. A. Sheard predicted that various influences &quot;will probably result in the production of a standard West Riding dialect&quot;, and K. M. Petyt found in 1985 that &quot;such a situation is at least very nearly in existence&quot;.

== Authentic recordings ==
The Survey of English Dialects in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s recorded over 30 examples of authentic Yorkshire dialects which can be heard online via the British Library Sound Archive. Below is a selection of recordings from this archive:

* Miss Madge Dibnah (b.1890) of Welwick, East Yorkshire, &quot;female housekeeper&quot;. According to the Library, &quot;much of her speech remains part of the local dialect to this day&quot;.
* Cooper Peacock (b.1887) of Muker, North Yorkshire, farmer.
* Unidentified of Golcar, West Yorkshire, mill worker.
* Mrs Hesselden (b.1882) of Pateley Bridge North Yorkshire.
* Ronald Easton (b.1895) of Skelton, North Yorkshire, farmer.

== Pronunciation ==
Some features of Yorkshire pronunciation are general features of northern English accents. Many of them are listed in the northern English accents section on the English English page.

=== Vowels ===

* Words such as &quot;strut, cut, blood, lunch&quot; usually take , although is a middle-class variant.
* Most words affected by the trap-bath split of South East England – the distinction between the sounds and – are not affected in Yorkshire. The long of southern English is widely disliked in the &quot;bath&quot;-type words. However, words such as &quot;palm, can&#x27;t, spa&quot; are pronounced with a long vowel, usually more fronted .
* In parts of the West Riding, &quot;none, one, once, nothing, tongue, among(st)&quot; are pronounced with rather than A shibboleth for a traditional Huddersfield accent is the word &quot;love&quot; as , pronounced with the same vowel as &quot;lot&quot;.
* Words such as &quot;late, face, say, game&quot; are pronounced with a monophthong or . However, words with &lt;gh&gt; in the spelling (e.g. straight, weight), as well as exclamations and interjections such as &quot;hey&quot; and &quot;eh&quot; (the tag question), are usually pronounced with a diphthong . Some words with &quot;ake&quot; at the end may be pronounced with , as in take to &quot;tek&quot;, make to &quot;mek&quot; and sake to &quot;sek&quot; (but not for &quot;bake&quot; or &quot;cake&quot;).
* Words with the vowel in Received Pronunciation, as in &quot;goat&quot;, may have a monophthong or . In a recent trend, a fronted monophthong is common amongst young women, although this has been the norm for a long time in Hull (where it originates). It has developed only since 1990, yet it has now spread to Bradford. historically there was a four-way split whereby a diphthong (west riding) or (north and east ridings) exists in words subject to vocalisation in middle English (e.g. &quot;grow, glow, bow, bowt, fowk, nowt, owt&quot; for &quot;grow, glow, bow, bought, folk, nought, ought&quot; respectively&quot;). The Os in some words are pronounced as , such as &quot;oppen&quot;, &quot;brokken&quot;, &quot;wokken&quot; for &quot;open, broken, woken&quot;. Other words spelled ow were pronounced with an aw sound such as &quot;knaw, snaw, blaw&quot; for &quot;know, snow, blow&quot;, from old English āw. An (west riding) or (north and east ridings) sound was found in words that were subject to lengthening of Old English [o] in middle English such as &quot;coil, hoil&quot; in the West Riding and &quot;cooal, hooal&quot; in the North and East Ridings for &quot;coal, hole&quot; . Another was (west riding) or (north and east ridings) that originated from old English ā (e.g. West Riding &quot;booan, hooam, booath, looaf, mooast&quot; and North and East Riding &quot;beean, yam, baith, leeaf, maist&quot; for &quot;bone, home, both, loaf, most&quot;). This four-way split was found throughout all of northern England and contrasted with the historic two-way split found in the south and midlands.
Due to dialect levelling, however, these sounds were merged into the modern monophthong , and (east riding) by the 1950s.
* If a close vowel precedes , a schwa may be inserted. This gives for and (less frequently) for .
* When precedes in a stressed syllable, can become . For example, &quot;very&quot; can be pronounced .
* In Hull, Middlesbrough and the east coast, the sound in &quot;word&quot;, &quot;heard&quot;, &quot;nurse&quot;, etc. is pronounced in the same way as in &quot;square, dare&quot;. This is . The set of words with , such as &quot;near, fear, beard,&quot; etc., may have a similar pronunciation but remains distinctive as .
** In other parts of Yorkshire, this sound is a short or long . This seems to have developed as an intermediate form between the older form (now very rare in these words) and the RP pronunciation . 
* In Hull, Middlesbrough and much of the East Riding, the phoneme (as in &quot;prize&quot;) may become a monophthong before a voiced consonant. For example, &quot;five&quot; becomes (fahv), &quot;prize&quot; becomes (). This does not occur before voiceless consonants, so &quot;price&quot; is .
* In the west riding, Middle English /uː/ is traditionally realised as a monophthong or in the Holme Valley as a diphthong [ɛə] as in &quot;daan&quot;, &quot;abaat&quot;, &quot;naa&quot;, &quot;haa&quot;, and aa&quot;t&quot; for &quot;down, about, now, how&quot; and &quot;out&quot;
** The traditional pronunciation of these words is in the east riding and the eastern part of the north riding; in the western half of the north riding, it is as in &quot;doon, aboot, noo, hoo, oot&quot;.These are now far less common than the RP found throughout Yorkshire. 
* Words like &quot;city&quot; and &quot;many&quot; are pronounced with a final in the Sheffield area.
* What would be a schwa on the end of a word in other accents is realised as in Hull and Middlesbrough.
* A prefix to a word is more likely not to take a reduced vowel sound in comparison to the same prefix&#x27;s vowel sound in other accents. For example, &quot;concern&quot; is or rather than , and &quot;admit&quot; is rather than .
* In some areas of the Yorkshire Dales (e.g. Dent, Sedbergh), the FLEECE vowel can be so that &quot;me&quot; is and &quot;green&quot; is .

The following features are recessive or even extinct; generally, they are less common amongst younger than older speakers in modern Yorkshire:
* Words originating from old English ō (e.g. &quot;goose, root, cool, roof, hoof&quot;) historically had an sound in the West Riding word-medially (&quot;ɡooise, rooit, cooil, rooif, hooif&quot;) as well as an sound in the North and East Ridings (&quot;ɡeease, reeat, keeal, reeaf, yuf&quot;). Today a more RP-like pronunciation is found in all Yorkshire accents.
* Traditionally in the West Riding, in word final environments and before [k], &quot;ō&quot; is realised as the vowel in words such as &quot;book&quot;, &quot;cook&quot;, and &quot;look&quot;, this also occurred in the east and north ridings, where it was realised before [k] as an and as in word final environments. 
* Traditionally words such as &quot;swear&quot;, &quot;there&quot;, &quot;wear&quot; take the diphthong , often written &quot;sweer, theer, weer&quot; in dialect writing. This sound may also be used in words originating from Old English ēa, commonly spelt &quot;ea&quot; in standard english spelling: for example, &quot;head&quot; as (&quot;heead&quot;), &quot;red&quot; as (&quot;reead&quot;) &quot;leaves&quot; as (&quot;leeavs&quot;).
* may take the place of , especially in the West Riding in words such as &quot;key, meat, speak&quot; often written &quot;key, meyt, speyk&quot; in dialect writing.
* Words such as &quot;door, floor, four, board&quot; may take on a variety of diphthongal pronunciations, . This is a consequence of an incomplete Horse-hoarse merger. 
* Words which once had a velar fricative in Old and Middle English or a vocalised consonant may have for (e.g. &quot;browt, thowt, nowt, owt, grow, gowd, bowt&quot; for &quot;brought, thought, nought, ought, grow, gold, bolt&quot;).
* Words that end &quot;-ight&quot; join the FLEECE lexical set. Today they can still be heard in their dialectal forms. For example, &quot;neet&quot; and &quot;reet&quot; . This can also be heard in Nova Scotia, Geordie and the Lancashire dialect.

=== Consonants ===
* In some areas, an originally voiced consonant followed by a voiceless one can be pronounced as voiceless. For example, &quot;Bradford&quot; may be pronounced as if it were &quot;Bratford&quot;, with (although more likely with a glottal stop, ) instead of the employed in most English accents. &quot;Absolute&quot; is often pronounced as if it were &quot;apsolute&quot;, with a in place of the .
* As with most dialects of English, final sound in, for example, &quot;hearing&quot; and &quot;eating&quot; are often reduced to . However, can be heard in Sheffield.
* H-dropping is common in informal speech, especially amongst the working classes.
* Omission of final stops and fricatives , especially in function words. As in other dialects, &quot;with&quot; can be reduced to &quot;wi&quot;, especially before consonants. &quot;Was&quot; is also often reduced to &quot;wa&quot; (pronounced roughly as &quot;woh&quot;), even when not in contracted negative form (see table below).
* A glottal stop may also be used to replace (e.g. &quot;like&quot; becomes ) at the end of a syllable.
* In the Middlesbrough area, glottal reinforcement occurs for .
* In some areas, an alveolar tap (a &#x27;tapped r&#x27;) is used after a labial (&quot;pray, bright, frog&quot;), after a dental (&quot;three&quot;), and intervocalically (&quot;very, sorry, pair of shoe&quot;s).

Some consonant changes amongst the younger generation are typical of younger speakers across England, but are not part of the traditional dialect:
* Th-fronting so that for (although Joseph Wright noted th-fronting in the Windhill area in 1892).
* T-glottalisation: a more traditional pronunciation is to realise as in certain phrases, which leads to pronunciation spellings such as &quot;gerroff&quot;.
* R-labialization: Possible for .

The following are typical of the older generation:
* In Sheffield, cases of initial &quot;th&quot; become . This pronunciation has led to Sheffielders being given the nickname &quot;dee dahs&quot; (the local forms of &quot;thee&quot; and &quot;thou&quot;/&quot;tha&quot;).
* realised as before . For example, &quot;clumsy&quot; becomes .

====Rhoticity====
At the time of the Survey of English Dialects, most places in Yorkshire were non-rhotic, but full rhoticity could be found in Swaledale, Lonsdale, Ribblesdale, and the rural area west of Halifax and Huddersfield. In addition, the area along the east coast of Yorkshire retained rhoticity when was in final position though not when it was in preconsonantal position (e.g. &quot;farmer&quot; ). A 1981 MA study found that rhoticity persisted in the towns of Hebden Bridge, Lumbutts, and Todmorden in Upper Calderdale.

Rhoticity seems to have been more widespread in Yorkshire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: for example, the city of Wakefield was marked as rhotic in the works of A. J. Ellis, and the recording of a prisoner of war from Wakefield in the Berliner Lautarchiv displays rhotic speech, but the speech of Wakefield nowadays is firmly non-rhotic.

=== Further information ===

These features can be found in the English Accents and Dialects collection on the British Library website. This website features samples of Yorkshire (and elsewhere in England) speech in &quot;wma&quot; format, with annotations on phonology with X-SAMPA phonetic transcriptions, lexis and grammar.

== Vocabulary and grammar ==
A list of non-standard grammatical features of Yorkshire speech is given below. In formal settings, these features are castigated and, as a result, their use is recessive. They are most common among older speakers and among the working class.

* Definite article reduction: shortening of &quot;the&quot; to a form without a vowel, often written t&#x27;. See this overview and a more detailed page on the Yorkshire Dialect website, and also . This is most likely to be a glottal stop , although traditionally it was or (in the areas that border Lancashire) .
* Some dialect words persist, although most have fallen out of use. The use of &quot;owt&quot; and &quot;nowt&quot;, derived from Old English &quot;a wiht&quot; and &quot;ne wiht&quot;, mean &quot;anything&quot; and &quot;nothing&quot;, as well as &quot;summat&quot; to mean &quot;something&quot;. They are pronounced and in North Yorkshire, but as and in most of the rest of Yorkshire. Other examples of dialect still in use include &quot;flayed&quot; (sometimes &quot;&quot;) (scared), &quot;laik&quot; (play), &quot;roar&quot; (cry), &quot;aye&quot; (yes), &quot;nay&quot; (emphatic &quot;no&quot;), &quot;and all&quot; (also), &quot;anyroad&quot; (anyway) and &quot;afore&quot; (before).
* When making a comparison such as &quot;greater than&quot; or &quot;lesser than&quot;, the word &quot;nor&quot; can be used in place of &quot;than&quot;, e.g. &quot;better nor him&quot;.
* Nouns describing units of value, weight, distance, height and sometimes volumes of liquid have no plural marker. For example, &quot;ten pounds&quot; becomes &quot;ten pound&quot;; &quot;five miles&quot; becomes &quot;five-mile&quot;.
* The word &quot;us&quot; is often used in place of &quot;me&quot; or in the place of &quot;our&quot; (e.g. we should put us names on us property). &quot;Us&quot; is invariably pronounced with a final rather than an .
* Use of the singular second-person pronoun &quot;thou&quot; (often written &quot;tha&quot;) and &quot;thee&quot;. This is a T form in the T–V distinction, and is largely confined to male speakers.
* &quot;Were&quot; can be used in place of &quot;was&quot; when connected to a singular pronoun. The reverse – i.e. producing constructions such as &quot;we was&quot; and &quot;you was&quot; – is also heard in a few parts of Yorkshire (e.g. Doncaster). This is also common in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Pronouncing &#x27;hospital&#x27; as &#x27;hospickle&#x27; and &#x27;little&#x27; as &#x27;lickle&#x27; is also common in Rotherham, as is shop workers and bus drivers greeting both males and females as &#x27;love&#x27; or &#x27;duck&#x27;.
* &quot;While&quot; is often used in the sense of &quot;until&quot; (e.g. &quot;Unless we go at a fair lick, we&#x27;ll not be home while seven.&quot;). &quot;Stay here while it shuts&quot; might cause a non-local to think that they should stay there &quot;during&quot; its shutting, when the order really indicates that they should stay only &quot;until&quot; it shuts. Joseph Wright wrote in the English Dialect Dictionary that this came from a shortening of the older word &quot;while-ever&quot;.
* The word &quot;self&quot; may become &quot;sen&quot;, e.g. &quot;yourself&quot; becomes &quot;thy sen&quot;, &quot;tha sen&quot;.
* Similar to other English dialects, using the word &quot;them&quot; to mean &quot;those&quot; is common, e.g. &quot;This used to be a pub back i them days&quot;.
* The word &quot;reight/reet&quot; is used to mean &quot;very&quot; or &quot;really&quot;, e.g. &quot;If Aw&#x27;m honest, Aw&#x27;m nut reight bother&#x27;d abaat it&quot;.
* As in many non-standard dialects, double negatives are common, e.g. &quot;I was never scared of nobody&quot;.
* The relative pronoun may be &quot;what&quot; or &quot;as&quot; rather than &quot;that&quot;, e.g. &quot;other people what I&#x27;ve heard&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s a man as likes his drink&quot;. Alternatively there may be no relative pronoun, e.g. &quot;I&#x27;ve a sister lives there&quot;.
* &quot;Yon&quot; to mean &quot;that over there&quot; is still used in some areas.

=== Contracted negatives ===
In informal Yorkshire speech, negatives may be more contracted than in other varieties of English. These forms are shown in the table below. Although the final consonant is written as , this may be realised as , especially when followed by a consonant.

&quot;Hadn&#x27;t&quot; does not become reduced to . This may be to avoid confusion with &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot; or &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot;, which can both be realised as .

== Yorkshire Dialect Society ==
The Yorkshire Dialect Society exists to promote and preserve the use of this extensively studied and recorded dialect. After many years of low activity, the Society gained some media attention in 2023 with their &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Tyke&quot; classes, teaching the traditional dialect to Yorkshire residents.

The Yorkshire Dialect Society is the oldest of England&#x27;s county dialect societies; it grew out of a committee of workers formed to collect material for the &quot;English Dialect Dictionary&quot;. The committee was formed in October 1894 at Joseph Wright&#x27;s suggestion, and the Yorkshire Dialect Society was founded in 1897. It publishes an annual volume of &quot;The Transactions of the Yorkshire Dialect Society&quot;; the contents of this include studies of English dialects outside Yorkshire, e.g. the dialects of Northumberland, and Shakespeare&#x27;s use of dialect. It also publishes an annual Summer Bulletin of dialect poetry.

In the early 1930s, the society recorded gramophone records of dialect speakers from Baildon, Cleveland, Cowling, Driffield and Sheffield. The recording from Cowling was provided by Lord Snowden of Ickornshaw.

Significant members of the society have included Joseph Wright, Walter Skeat, Harold Orton, Stanley Ellis, J. D. A. Widdowson, K. M. Petyt, Graham Shorrocks, Frank Elgee, and Clive Upton.

Although Joseph Wright was involved in the Society&#x27;s foundation, the Society&#x27;s annual &quot;Transactions&quot; published one of the first critiques of his work in 1977. Peter Anderson, then the editor of the &quot;Transactions&quot;, argued that Wright took much of his material for his work &quot;English Dialect Grammar&quot; without sufficient citation from the work of Alexander John Ellis and that Wright did Ellis &quot;a disservice&quot; by criticising this same work.

==Examples of traditional Yorkshire dialect==

== Yorkshire dialect and accent in popular culture ==
Wilfred Pickles, a Yorkshireman born in Halifax, was selected by the BBC as an announcer for its North Regional radio service; he went on to be an occasional newsreader on the BBC Home Service during World War II. He was the first newsreader to speak in a regional accent rather than Received Pronunciation, &quot;a deliberate attempt to make it more difficult for Nazis to impersonate BBC broadcasters&quot;, and caused some comment with his farewell catchphrase &quot;... and to all in the North, good neet&quot;.

The director Ken Loach has set several of his films in South or West Yorkshire and has stated that he does not want actors to deviate from their natural accent. The relevant films by Loach include &quot;Kes&quot; (Barnsley), &quot;Days of Hope&quot; (first episode in south of West Yorkshire), &quot;The Price of Coal&quot; (South Yorkshire and Wakefield), &quot;The Gamekeeper&quot; (Sheffield), &quot;Looks and Smiles&quot; (Sheffield) and &quot;The Navigators&quot; (South and West Yorkshire). Loach&#x27;s films were used in a French dialectological analysis on changing speech patterns in South Yorkshire. Loach said in his contribution that the speech in his recently released film &quot;The Navigators&quot; was less regionally-marked than in his early film &quot;Kes&quot; because of changing speech patterns in South Yorkshire, which the authors of the article interpreted as a move towards a more standard dialect of English.

Dialect of the northern dales featured in the series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;.

A number of popular bands hail from Yorkshire and have distinctive Yorkshire accents. Singer-songwriter YUNGBLUD, originating from Doncaster, preserves a strong Yorkshire accent. Louis Tomlinson, who was a member of One Direction, is from Yorkshire and in his solo music his accent is often heard. Joe Elliott and Rick Savage, vocalist and bassist of Def Leppard; Alex Turner, vocalist of the Arctic Monkeys; Jon McClure, of Reverend and The Makers; Jon Windle, of Little Man Tate; Jarvis Cocker, vocalist of Pulp; and Joe Carnall, of Milburn and Phil Oakey of The Human League are all known for their Sheffield accents, whilst The Cribs, who are from Netherton, sing in a Wakefield accent. The Kaiser Chiefs originate in Leeds, as does the Brett Domino Trio, the musical project of comedian Rod J. Madin. Graham Fellows, in his persona as John Shuttleworth, uses his Sheffield accent, though his first public prominence was as cockney Jilted John. Toddla T, a former DJ on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra, has a strong Sheffield accent and often used on air the phrase &quot;big up thysen&quot; (an adaptation into Yorkshire dialect of the slang term &quot;big up yourself&quot; which is most often used in the music and pop culture of the Jamaican diaspora). Similarly, grime crews such as Scumfam use a modern Sheffield accent, which still includes some dialect words.

The Lyke Wake Dirge, written in old North Riding Dialect, was set to music by the folk band Steeleye Span. Although the band was not from Yorkshire, they attempted Yorkshire pronunciations in words such as &quot;light&quot; and &quot;night&quot; as and .

Actor Sean Bean normally speaks with a Yorkshire accent in his acting roles, as does actor Matthew Lewis, famously known for playing Neville Longbottom in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.

Wallace of Wallace and Gromit, voiced by Peter Sallis, has his accent from Holme Valley of West Yorkshire, despite the character living in nearby Lancashire. Sallis has said that creator Nick Park wanted a Lancashire accent, but Sallis could only manage to do a Yorkshire one.
The late British Poet Laureate, Ted Hughes originated from Mytholmroyd, close to the border with Lancashire, and spent much of his childhood in Mexborough, South Yorkshire. His own readings of his work were noted for his &quot;flinty&quot; or &quot;granite&quot; voice and &quot;distinctive accent&quot; and some said that his Yorkshire accent affected the rhythm of his poetry.

The soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, formerly &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, was noted for use of broad Yorkshire, but the storylines involving numerous incomers have diluted the dialect until it is hardly heard.

In the ITV Edwardian/interwar period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, set at a fictional country estate in North Yorkshire between Thirsk and Ripon, many of the servants and nearly all of the local villagers have Yorkshire accents. BBC One series &quot;Happy Valley&quot; and &quot;Last Tango in Halifax&quot;, both from creator Sally Wainwright of Huddersfield, also heavily feature Yorkshire accents.

In the HBO television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, many of the characters from the North of Westeros speak with Yorkshire accents, matching the native dialect of Sean Bean, who plays Lord Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark.

Several of the dwarfs in the Peter Jackson film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, namely Thorin Oakenshield, Kíli and Fili, speak with Yorkshire accents.

The character of the Fat Controller in the &quot;Thomas and Friends&quot; TV series, as voiced by Michael Angelis, has a broad Yorkshire accent.

&quot;On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at&quot;, a popular folk song, is sung in the Yorkshire dialect and accent and considered to be the unofficial anthem of Yorkshire.

Actress Jodie Whittaker keeps her native Yorkshire accent in her role as the Thirteenth Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

The freeware action game &quot;Poacher&quot; by Ben &quot;Yahtzee&quot; Croshaw features Yorkshireman as a protagonist and majority of the in-game dialogues is done in Yorkshire dialect.

Studies have shown that accents in the West Riding (that is, mostly, modern West and South Yorkshire), and by extension local dialects, are well-liked among Britons and associated with common sense, loyalty, and reliability.

<text>The  (; ; abbreviation: ₶ or £) was one of numerous currencies used in medieval France, and a unit of account (i.e., a monetary unit used in accounting) used in early modern France.

The 1262 monetary reform established the as 20 , or 80.88 grams of fine silver. The was a gold coin of one minted in large numbers from 1360.
In 1549, the was decreed a unit of account, and in 1667 it officially replaced the . 
In 1720, the was redefined as 0.31 grams of pure gold, and in 1726, in a devaluation under Louis XV, as 4.50516 grams of fine silver.
It was the basis of the revolutionary French franc of 1795, defined as 4.5 grams of fine silver exactly.

==Circulating currency==
In France, the was worth 240 deniers (the &quot;Tours penny&quot;). These deniers were first minted by the abbey of Saint Martin, in the province of Touraine. Soon after Philip II of France seized the counties of Anjou and Touraine in 1203 and standardized the use of the there, the began to supersede the (Paris pound) which had been up to that point the official currency of the Capetian dynasty.

The was, in common with the original livre of Charlemagne, divided into 20 ( after 1715), each of which was divided into 12 deniers.

Between 1360 and 1641, coins worth one were minted, known as (the name coming from the inscription , []). Other francs were minted under Charles V, Henry III and Henry IV. The use of the name &quot;franc&quot; became a synonym for in accounting.

The first French paper money, issued between 1701 and 1720, was denominated in (see &quot;Standard Catalog of World Paper Money&quot;, Albert Pick). This was the last time the name was used officially, as later notes and coins were denominated simply in , the having finally been abolished in 1667.

==Accounting currency==
With many forms of domestic and international money (with different weights, purities and quality) circulating throughout Europe in the late Middle Ages and the early modern period, the use of an &quot;accounting currency&quot; became a financial necessity. In the world of international banking of the 13th century, it was the florin and ducat that were often used. In France, the and the currency system based on it became a standard monetary unit of accounting and continued to be used even when the ceased to exist as an actual coin. For example, the Louisiana Purchase treaty of 1803 specified the relative ratios of the franc, dollar and .

The official use of the accounting unit in all contracts in France was legislated in 1549, but it had been one of the standard units of accounting in France since the 13th century. In 1577 the accounting unit was officially abolished and accountants switched to the écu, which was at that time the major French gold coin in actual circulation, but in 1602 the accounting unit was brought back. (A monetary unit of accounting based on the continued to be used for minor uses in and around Paris and was not officially abolished until 1667 by Louis XIV).

Since coins in Europe in the Middle Ages and the early modern period (the French écu, Louis, teston d&#x27;argent, denier, double, franc; the Spanish doubloon, pistole, real; the Italian florin, ducat or sequin; the German and Austrian thaler; the Dutch gulden, etc.) did not have any indication of their value, their official value was determined by royal edicts. In cases of financial need, French kings could use the official value for currency devaluation. This could be done in two ways: (1) the amount of precious metal in a newly minted French coin could be reduced while nevertheless maintaining the old value in or (2) the official value of a domestic or foreign coin in circulation could be increased. By reversing these techniques, currencies could be reinforced.

For example: 
* the worth of an écu d&#x27;or, a French gold coin, was changed from 60 to 57 sols in 1573.
* to curb increasing use of the Spanish real, its official worth was decreased to 4 sols 2 deniers in the 1570s.

Royal finance officers faced many difficulties. In addition to currency speculation, forgery and the intentional shaving of precious metal from coins (which was harshly punished), they had the difficult problem of setting values for gold, silver, copper and billon coins, responding to the often large influx of foreign coin and the appearance of inferior foreign coins of intentionally similar design. For more on these issues, see Monetary policy and Gresham&#x27;s law.

A glyph for the was added to Unicode 5.2, in the Currency Symbols block at code point U+20B6.

<doc id="462984" wikidata="Q951353" url="?curid=462984" title="Humanistic Judaism">
<text>Humanistic Judaism () is a Jewish movement that offers a nontheistic alternative to contemporary branches of Judaism. It defines Judaism as the cultural and historical experience of the Jewish people rather than a religion, and encourages Jews who are humanistic and secular to celebrate their identity by participating in relevant holidays and rites of passage (such as weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs) with inspirational ceremonies that go beyond traditional literature while still drawing upon it.

==Origins==
In its current form, Humanistic Judaism was founded in either 1963 or 1965 (sources differ) by American Rabbi Sherwin Wine. As a rabbi trained in Reform Judaism with a small, secular, non-theistic congregation, he developed a Jewish liturgy that reflected his and his congregation&#x27;s philosophical viewpoints by combining Jewish culture, history, and identity with humanistic outlooks while excluding all prayers and references to a god of any kind. This congregation developed into the Birmingham Temple in Farmington Hills, Michigan. It was soon joined by a previously Reform congregation in Illinois and a group in Westport, Connecticut.

In 1969, all three congregations were organizationally united with other groups under the umbrella of the Society for Humanistic Judaism (SHJ). The SHJ had 10,000 members across 30 congregations in the United States and Canada in 1994; however, there are many congregations that identify with Humanistic Judaism&#x27;s teachings but are not members of the SHJ.

As of 2020, the Pew Research Center estimated that Humanistic Judaism, along with Reconstructionism and other smaller denominations, constituted 4% of the United States&#x27;s 7.5 million Jews.

The International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism (IISHJ), founded in 1986, is the academic and intellectual center of Humanistic Judaism. It currently has two centers of activity: the original in Jerusalem and another in Lincolnshire, Illinois. Rabbi Adam Chalom is the dean of the IISHJ&#x27;s American site. The IISHJ offers professional training programs for spokespersons, educators, leaders (also referred to in Hebrew as &quot;madrikhim/ot&quot; or Yiddish as &quot;vegvayzer&quot;), and rabbis, in addition to its publications, public seminars, and colloquia for lay audiences.

==Principles of belief and practice==
According to the SHJ, the philosophical foundation of Humanistic Judaism includes the following ideas:

* Judaism is the culture of the Jewish people, which includes many religious and secular traditions.
* A Jew is any person who chooses to identify with the faith and culture of the Jewish people.
* After the Holocaust, it is clear that the meaning of Jewish history is that Jews must be responsible for their own fate.
* Every person is entitled to be the master of their own life, subject to the final authority of his or her own conscience.
* The power to achieve human survival, happiness, and dignity is a human power.

Humanistic Judaism presents a far more radical departure from traditional Jewish religion than Mordecai Kaplan, the co-founder of Reconstructionist Judaism, ever envisioned. Kaplan redefined God and other traditional religious terms so as to make them consistent with the naturalist outlook, but continued to use traditional prayer language. Wine rejected this approach as confusing, since participants could ascribe to these words whatever definitions they favored. Wine strove to achieve philosophical consistency and stability by creating rituals and ceremonies that were purely non-theistic. Services were created for Shabbat, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and other Jewish holidays and festivals, often with reinterpretation of the meaning of the holiday to bring it into conformity with secular humanistic philosophy.

Humanistic Judaism was developed as a possible answer to the problem of retaining Jewish identity and continuity among non-religious Jews. Recognizing that congregational religious life was thriving, Wine believed that secular Jews who had rejected theism would be attracted to an organization that provided all the same forms and activities as the religious branches of Judaism, but which expressed a purely secular humanistic viewpoint. In terms of social issues, the SHJ has outlined its stance in a series of ongoing statements.

<text>The Alvinellidae are a family of small, deep-sea polychaete worms endemic to hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean. Belonging to the order Terebellida, the family contains two genera, Alvinella and Paralvinella; the former genus contains two valid species and the latter eight. Members of the family are termed alvinellids.

The family was first described in 1979 after discoveries made off the Galápagos Islands by the crew of the DSV &quot;Alvin&quot;. The ship subsequently lent its name to the family and genera within it.

The worms build mucus tubes and extend red feathery gills. Members of the Alvinellidae are noted for their exceptional heat tolerance: one species, the Pompeii worm (&quot;Alvinella pompejana&quot;), is thought to be the most heat-tolerant complex organism on Earth. Mitochondria start to break down at temperatures of , apparently providing an upper limit for eukaryotes. Under laboratory conditions, in a pressurized aquarium with a heat gradient, worms of the species &quot;Paralvinella sulfincola&quot;, chose water heated to and made brief forays into water as hot as . Unlike other (chemosynthetic) vent-dwelling worms, alvinellid worms possess a digestive tract. However, they do rely on an episymbiotic relationship with thermophilic bacteria; hair-like growths of the bacteria living on the worm&#x27;s back are thought to offer thermal protection to the worm.

<text>Nicholas (Kasatkin), Equal-to-the-Apostles, Archbishop of Japan, born Ivan Dmitrovich Kasatkin (; – 16 February 1912) was a Russian Orthodox priest, monk, and bishop. He introduced the Eastern Orthodox Church to Japan. The Orthodox cathedral of Tokyo (metropolitan diocese of Japan), Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral, was informally named after him as &quot;Nikorai-do&quot;, first by the local community, and today nationwide, in remembrance of his work.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in the Smolensk prefecture in the Russian Empire to Dimitry Kasatkin, a Russian Orthodox deacon. His mother died when he was five years old. In 1857, he entered the Theological Academy in Saint Petersburg.

On 24 June 1860, he was tonsured with the name Nicholas by the academy rector, Bishop Nectarius Nadezhdin. Nicholas was ordained deacon on 29 July the same year; the following day, on the altar day of the academy church (the feast day of the Holy Apostles, according to the Julian Calendar), he was ordained to the priesthood.

==Japan==
On 2 July 1861, Nicholas landed at Hakodate, Hokkaidō, Japan, as a priest attached to the chapel of the Russian consulate in Hakodate. He had volunteered for the appointment to this duty, attracted since the day he noticed a poster calling for a priest for this chapel when he was a seminary student. After he arrived at the consulate, he studied Japanese and quickly gained mastery of the language. He studied Buddhism during the first eight years of his time in Japan, when, in his words, he &quot;strove with all diligence to study Japanese history, religion, and the spirit of the Japanese people&quot;.

While at the consulate chapel, he converted three Japanese, one of whom, a former samurai and Shinto priest named Sawabe Takuma, had originally come to his home to kill him. After conversion, Sawabe became one of the first Japanese Orthodox priests. In 1870, Nicholas was made an archimandrite and moved to Tokyo, and began an extensive missionary effort. He bought property on a height in Kanda Surugadai for his headquarters which later became the site of the see of the Orthodox Archbishop of Japan. Under his leadership, by 1870 the Orthodox community numbered more than 4,000 people, and by 1912 about 33,000 people and 266 Orthodox communities.

Nicholas was consecrated bishop on 30 March 1880, as Bishop of Revel, auxiliary to the Archdiocese of Riga. While Nicholas never visited the city, the parish of Revel supported his Japanese mission financially. In the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, bishops sign with their see, but Nicholas made his habit to sign as &quot;Episcop (Bishop) Nicholai&quot;, without mentioning Revel. He presided over the consecration of the Tokyo Resurrection Cathedral in 1891, and was elevated to the dignity of Archbishop of All Japan by the Russian Orthodox Holy Synod on 6 April 6, 1907.

===Russo-Japanese War===
During the Russo-Japanese War, Nicholas stayed in Japan. Those days were very difficult for him. His love for the land of his birth conflicted with his duty as the bishop of Japan to support his faithful and to pray for the Japanese emperor and the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy. In the Orthodox liturgy at that time, priests had to explicitly pray not only benediction on the sovereign and his army but also for the defeat of his enemies in the intercession. Nicholas, therefore, did not participate in any public services during the war; instead, he encouraged his Japanese faithful both to pray for and to contribute to the Army and the Navy. Some encouraged him to go back to Russia, but he refused and worked eagerly for Japanese faithful and Russian prisoners of war. In a letter on the conditions of a camp in Hamadera, Osaka, Nicholas wrote of his astonishment at the Russians soldiers&#x27; illiteracy: &quot;nine of ten captives could not read.&quot;

Nicholas sent priests and teachers to camps to educate and care for the captives. His attitude and manners impressed not only the Orthodox faithful but also non-Christians.

==Character==
Even Emperor Meiji was impressed with his character, especially his diplomatic efforts between the Russian Imperial Household and the Japanese government. When the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was the Tsarevich under Alexander III, the young Nicholas II visited Japan and was injured during the Ōtsu Incident by a Japanese policeman. Bishop Nicholas made a great effort to resolve this incident.

Nicholas&#x27;s study of Japanese was fruitful, allowing him to translate all liturgy books and many parts of the Bible including the whole of the New Testament and Psalms, most of the Book of Genesis and the Book of Isaiah with help from a Japanese Christian and scholar Nakai Tsugumaro who ran a &quot;kanbun&quot; private school Kaitokudo in Osaka. His translations are still used in the liturgy of Japanese Orthodox Church. Being fond of church singing, Kasatkin made a significant contribution in introducing this art to the Japanese. He also established a theological seminary, primary schools for boys and girls, a library, shelter and other agencies.

Nicholas wrote a diary in Russian for years, recording the pastoral life of early Orthodox Church of Japan as well as his thought and observation of Meiji era Japan. His diary was believed to have been burned and lost in Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, but rediscovered by Kennosuke Nakamura, a Russian literary researcher, and published in 2004 as &quot;Dnevniki Sviatogo Nikolaia Iaponskogo&quot; (5 vols. Saint Petersburg: Giperion, 2004). Nakamura translated the whole diary into Japanese and published with his commentary in 2007.

Nicholas offered an integral study of Buddhism in his work, &quot;Japan from the point of view of Christian mission&quot;, published in 1869. This was the first description of Japanese Buddhism accessible to the Russian language reader.

== Veneration ==
Nicholas was the first saint of the Japanese Orthodox Church. After his death, his body was buried in Tokyo Metropolitan Yanaka Cemetery, near Ueno. In 1970, he was canonized as &#x27;Equal-to-the-Apostles, Archbishop of Japan, St Nicholas&#x27;. His feast day is 3 February (New Calendar), 16 February (Old Calendar). The Russian Orthodox Church and the Japanese Orthodox Church celebrate this feast nationwide on the old-style date.

There is a church which commemorates him in Maebashi, Gunma, built in 1974. There is also an Eastern Orthodox Church dedicated to Saint Nicholas of Japan in Moscow.

<text>Mehmedalija &quot;Mak&quot; Dizdar (17 October 1917 – 14 July 1971) was a Bosnian poet. His poetry combined influences from the Bosnian Christian culture, Islamic mysticism and cultural remains of medieval Bosnia, and especially the stećci.

His works &quot;Kameni spavač (Stone Sleeper)&quot; and &quot;Modra rijeka (Blue River)&quot; are probably the most important Bosnian poetic achievements of the 20th century.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mehmedalija Dizdar was born during World War I, to a Muslim family in Stolac, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was the son of Muharem (died 1923) and Nezira (née Babović; 1881–1945). Mehmedalija was the second of three children. His older brother Hamid was a writer. Mehmedalija&#x27;s sister Refika (1921–1945) and mother were killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp.

===Career===
In 1936, Dizdar relocated to Sarajevo where he attended and graduated from the Gymnasium. He started working for the magazine &quot;Gajret&quot;, which his brother Hamid regulated and which was founded by Safvet beg Bašagić.

Dizdar spent his World War II years as a supporter of the Communist Partisans. He moved frequently from place to place in order to avoid the Independent State of Croatia authorities&#x27; attention.

After the war, Dizdar was a prominent figure in the cultural life of Bosnia and Herzegovina, working as the editor-in-chief of the daily &quot;Oslobođenje&quot; (&quot;Liberation&quot;). He served as head of a few state-sponsored publishing houses and eventually became a professional writer and the President of the Writers&#x27; Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a post he held until his death.

==Personal life==
Dizdar&#x27;s son Enver (8 June 1944 – 21 December 2012) was a journalist and publicist.

Mak Dizdar died aged 53 in 1971, having outlived his parents and both siblings.

==Work==
Dizdar&#x27;s two poetry collections and series of longer poems, &quot;Kameni spavač&quot; (&quot;Stone Sleeper&quot;) (1966–71) and &quot;Modra rijeka&quot; (&quot;Blue River&quot;, 1971), fused seemingly disparate elements. He drew inspiration from pre-Ottoman Bosnian Christian culture, from the sayings of heterodox Islamic visionary mystics, and from the 15th century Bosnian vernacular linguistic idiom. His poetry referenced medieval Bosnian tombstones (&quot;stećci&quot; or &quot;mramorovi&quot; - marbles) and their gnomic inscriptions on the ephemerality of life. It articulated a distinctive vision of life and death, drawing on Christian and Muslim Gnostic sensibilities of life as a passage between &quot;tomb and stars&quot;, expressing both the Gnostic horror of corporeality and a sense of the blessedness of the universe.

His literary work is a part of common heritage of Serbs, Croats, Montenegrins and Bosniaks.

==Dizdar and Stećci==
In Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are about 60,000 stećci and a total of 70,000 in the greater region. The stećci are inscribed with various symbols and illustrations. Many of the symbols on the stećci bore significant religious symbolism in Dizdar’s works. The most common religious motifs visible on the stećci were a crescent moon, stars and circles (representing the sun). The second most common motif were the cross, which never appears alone. It regularly is seen in unison with a crescent moon and a star, and also sometimes with other symbols like a shield, sword, spear or flags. Other symbols used on stećci were men with large right hands, spirals, images of a kolo and deer. In addition to carved symbols on the stećci, short inscriptions or epigraphs were also carved into many stećci. The inscriptions on the stećci characterized the whole life of the deceased - their habits, the manner of their death, the love of their country in which they lie, and their awe at death.

Dizdar used the symbols and the inscriptions on the stećci as the backbone for his most famous work, &quot;Kameni Spavač&quot;. Dizdar’s Bosnia was &quot;defined by the stećci and Bosnia’s stigma regarding the question of it being the poetic subject response: its defiance from dreams.&quot; Dizdar used the symbols and inscriptions on the stećci to give &quot;Kameni Spavač&quot; a historical point of view, by envisioning the world through the eyes of the medieval peoples buried under the stećci. By envisioning the world through the eyes of the stone sleepers buried under the stećci, Dizdar was able to discuss many themes. Through the stećci, he discussed themes of &quot;the intimate life journey of origin, of homeland or landscapes, of sources of knowledge, of experiences of the world, of a new and coordinated deciphering of signs, which reach pass their singularity.&quot;

Dizdar said that the themes expressed in the inscriptions were the “secrets of Bosnia.” Dizdar himself described the importance and mystery of the stećci by saying “stećak is for me what it is not for others, things that are on them or in them, others did not inscribe or knew to see. It is stone, but also a word, it is earth, but also heaven, it is matter, but also a spirit, it is a cry, but also a song, it is death, but also life, it is the past, but also the future.”

Mak Dizdar also fought against the forced influence of Serbicisms on the Bosnian colloquial vernacular, in his 1970 article &quot;Marginalije o jeziku i oko njega&quot;.

After the collapse of Communism and following the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dizdar&#x27;s poetic &quot;magnum opus&quot; has remained the cornerstone of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina literature.

<text>ConFurence was the first exclusively furry convention, held annually in southern California from 1989 to 2003. The large furry presence at the BayCon science fiction conventions instigated Mark Merlino and Rod O&#x27;Riley to throw &quot;furry parties&quot; at Westercon, Baycon, and other west coast sci-fi conventions in the late 80&#x27;s. This led to the test gathering in 1989, ConFurence Zero.

The convention became well known in mainstream media and among the furry fandom for its sexual themes. Sam Conway said, “By ConFurence 6 it looked like PrideFest”. Although Mark Merlino claims nothing special happened at the convention. 

==History==
After trying the Red Lion hotel, Confurence 0 was held at the Holiday Inn Bristol Plaza in Costa Mesa, California, on January 21 to 22, 1989. According to Joe Strike, While attendance for this first serious attempt to create a &quot;funny animal fandom&quot; convention was sparse at 65 persons, it was enough to encourage the Californians to attempt a full-fledged furry convention next year. Attendance was doubled to 130 for the first official ConFurence convention in January 1990, proving them right. 

In 1997 Kare 11 reported adult oriented events going on at the convention. At the height of popularity in 1998, ConFurence 9 boasted the then-largest furry convention attendance of 1250. 

Control of the ConFurence convention was transferred to Darrel Exline in 1999, who created a new entity called &quot;The ConFurence Group&quot; to run it, but by 2003 attendance had dwindled to 470 due to increased competition from other regional furry conventions and infighting among different factions of anthropomorphic fandom. The final ConFurence gathering gained notoriety when television crew from &quot;The Man Show&quot; appeared and attempted to interview attendees on camera.

With the demise of ConFurence, Mark Merlino and Robert Johnson Jr. teamed up to establish Califur in 2004 to continue the tradition of a furry convention in Southern California.

==Legacy==

ConFurence created the mold by which other furry conventions were to follow, with the successful art show, a masquerade and an emphasis on fan-created content and Guests of Honor. As of 2018 there are dozens furry conventions and many more meets and gatherings all around the world, due in part to ConFurence&#x27;s lead.

The name ConFurence is a registered trademark of the ConFurence Group. It is not a generic term for a furry convention, but as the original furry convention, many later cons took similar-sounding names, such as the now defunct ConFurence East (originally called &quot;Furtasticon&quot; in 1994 and took the name &quot;MoreFurCon&quot; just before its dissolution in 1997), and the current Eurofurence.

<text>The Hutchinson River Parkway (known colloquially as the Hutch) is a controlled-access parkway in southern New York in the United States. It extends for from the Bruckner Interchange in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx to the New York–Connecticut state line at Rye Brook. The parkway continues south from the Bruckner Interchange as the Hutchinson River Expressway (Interstate 678) and north into Greenwich, Connecticut, as the Merritt Parkway (Connecticut Route 15). The roadway is named for the Hutchinson River, a stream in southern Westchester County that the road follows alongside. The river, in turn, was named for English colonial religious leader Anne Hutchinson.

Construction of the parkway began in 1924 and was completed in 1941. The section of the parkway between Eastern Boulevard (now Bruckner Boulevard) in the Bronx and U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Pelham Manor was designated as New York State Route 1X (NY 1X) from 1941 to 1946. NY 1A was subsequently realigned to follow the Hutch between Eastern Boulevard and US 1. The NY 1A designation was removed around 1962.

== Route description ==
The road is designated as NY 908A within the Bronx and is maintained by the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). In Westchester County, the road is designated as NY 907W and is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Both designations are unsigned reference routes. Like the Bronx River Parkway, the reference route designation of the parkway in Westchester County violates the numbering scheme used by the NYSDOT. The second digit of a reference route designation typically indicates its region. While other reference routes in the county carry a second digit of &quot;8&quot;, as Westchester County is located in region 8, the &quot;0&quot; in 907W is indicative of regions 10 and 11, containing Long Island and New York City, respectively.

=== Throggs Neck to Pelham ===

The Hutchinson River Parkway begins at the large Bruckner Interchange in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx. This interchange consists of junctions with the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and I-295), the Hutchinson River Expressway (I-678), and the Bruckner Expressway (I-95 and I-278). The Hutchinson River Parkway proceeds north as a continuation of I-678, entering exit 1A, a small 1-lane ramp to Bruckner Boulevard near Saint Raymond&#x27;s Cemetery. Just to the north of exit 1A, gas stations appear on each side of the road, which turns northeast and into exit 1B, a connection to East Tremont Avenue. After exit 1B, the parkway crosses under the IRT Pelham Line just west of Middletown Road subway station, crossing into the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx.

Just after crossing into Pelham Bay, the parkway enters exits 1C–D, an interchange with Pelham Parkway in a small section of Pelham Bay Park. After crossing over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, the parkway crosses out of Pelham Bay Park and into exit 2A–B, a junction with I-95 and the New England Thruway. Crossing over Bartow Avenue and the Hutchinson River, the parkway crosses into the main section of Pelham Bay Park, where exit 3 forks off towards the center of the park. The now six-lane parkway crosses north through Pelham Bay Park, entering exit 4A, another junction with the New England Thruway. When the Hutchinson River Parkway leaves Pelham Bay Park, the right-of-way leaves the Bronx and enters Westchester County. Now in the village of Pelham Manor, the parkway enters exit 4B, an interchange with US 1 (Boston Post Road). Southbound, an exit 5A is present, a ramp to Sandford Boulevard in Pelham Manor. Proceeding northbound, exit 5 connects to Colonial Avenue, the continuation of Sandford Boulevard after the Hutchinson River Parkway in the adjacent village of Pelham. The parkway winds north through Pelham, entering exit 5B on the southbound lanes, a connection to East 3rd Street. Winding northeast, the parkway crosses under the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line just west of Pelham station. Just after the line, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into exit 6A, a bi-directional junction with Lincoln Avenue in Pelham.

=== Mount Vernon to Connecticut ===
Soon the parkway leaves Pelham for Mount Vernon, entering the Chester Heights section. In Mount Vernon, the Hutchinson River Parkway enters exit 6B, a connection to the Cross County Parkway. The parkway winds northeast into exit 7, a junction with New Rochelle Road, bending northwest through Nature Study Woods Park. The parkway then bends north into New Rochelle. Just after crossing into New Rochelle, the Cross County Parkway merges into the northbound lanes. Crossing through Twin Lakes Park, the parkway enters exit 8, a junction with the northern end of Webster Avenue. Passing around Reservoir 3, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into Eastchester and soon back into New Rochelle near exit 9, which connects to North Avenue.

To the north, exit 9A and exit 9B going southbound junctions with Mill Road in Eastchester, the continuation of North Avenue. After exits 9A and 9B, the parkway passes east of Reservoir 1 and south of exit 9C, Wilmot Road. The Hutchinson River Parkway proceeds northeast as a four-lane freeway through New Rochelle. The parkway crosses under NY 125 (Weaver Street), which is accessible southbound via exit 11. Proceeding northbound, exit 11 services Hutchinson Avenue, which connects to NY 125 and Quaker Ridge Country Club. Now in the Quaker Ridge section of Scarsdale, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into exit 12, Mamaroneck Road near Saxon Woods County Park. The parkway runs along the southern end of the park, entering exit 13A-B in the center of the park.

Exit 13A-B services Mamaroneck Avenue as it crosses over the West Branch of the Mamaroneck River. Leaving the park, the Hutchinson River Parkway enters White Plains, crossing past a median rest area. The parkway continues northeast, entering exit 14, a diamond interchange with NY 127 (North Street) in Harrison. Passing Maple Moor Golf Course, the Hutchinson River Parkway enters exit 15A–B, a cloverleaf interchange with I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). Just to the north of the interchange, NY 984J forks to the northwest towards I-684 in Harrison at exit 16A. Just northeast of NY 984J, exit 16B forks to NY 120 (Purchase Street).

After exit 16A-B the parkway makes a bend to the southeast entering exit 17, a junction with Lincoln Avenue in Harrison. The four-lane parkway winds northeast once again, entering exit 18, a junction with North Ridge Street in Rye Brook. The Hutchinson River Parkway enters exit 19A, a connection with NY 120A (King Street). At this interchange, the Hutchinson River Parkway crosses into the state of Connecticut and continues northeast as the Merritt Parkway (Route 15).

== History ==
Construction of the parkway began in 1924 and the first two-mile (3 km) section was completed in December 1927. By October 1928, of the parkway were open, connecting US 1 in Pelham Manor, New York with Westchester Avenue in White Plains, New York. The original roadway was an undivided freeway, designed with gently sloping curves, stone arch bridges, and wooden lightposts. The original section included bridle paths along the right-of-way. There was also a riding academy where the public could rent horses.

In 1930, Robert Moses, an American public official who worked on New York metropolitan area infrastructure, announced plans to build more parkways in the Bronx. A southward extension from Pelham Manor to Pelham Bay Park opened on December 11, 1937. The new southerly extension became part of a rerouted New York State Route 1A. The final segment of the parkway—a southward extension to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge—was completed on October 11, 1941 and was initially designated NY 1X. The NY 1X designation was removed in 1946 and replaced with a realigned NY 1A, which had previously followed Bruckner Boulevard and Shore Road between what is now the Bruckner Interchange and Exit 5 on the Hutch. The NY 1A designation was completely removed .

Originally, the parkway was built and designated all the way to the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge, but the original parkway designs did not allow for commercial traffic. When the bridge was designated I-678, the section between the Bruckner Interchange and the Bronx–Whitestone Bridge had to be converted to Interstate Highway standards. Once that was completed in 1972, that section was assigned the I-678 designation and renamed the Hutchinson River Expressway. Modifications in 1984 included the straightening of some curves, increased sight distances, removal of the rustic lightposts, and lengthening of acceleration and deceleration lanes. Originally, there was a 10 cent toll in Pelham between exits 7 and 8. The toll was increased to 25 cents in 1958 and removed on October 31, 1994, with the last toll collected just before midnight. The tolls were abolished on the Saw Mill River and Hutchinson River parkways in November 1994. In mid-2021, the parkway&#x27;s exit numbers were changed from sequential to mileage-based numbering. In addition, I-684 was assigned an exit number after initially being unsigned, which is Exit 16A.

<text>Mare Island (Spanish: &quot;Isla de la Yegua&quot;) is a peninsula in the United States in the city of Vallejo, California, about northeast of San Francisco. The Napa River forms its eastern side as it enters the Carquinez Strait juncture with the east side of San Pablo Bay. Mare Island is a peninsula, as no full body of water separates this or several other named &quot;islands&quot; from the mainland. Instead, a series of small sloughs cause seasonal water-flows among the so-called islands. Mare Island is the largest of these at about long and a mile wide.

==History==

In 1775, Spanish explorer Perez Ayala was the first European to land on what would become Mare Island – he named it &quot;Isla de la Plana&quot;. This area was part of Rancho Suscol, deeded to General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo in 1844. It became a waypoint for early settlers. In 1835, whilst traversing the Carquinez Strait, a crude ferry transporting men and livestock capsized in a squall. Among the livestock feared lost in the wreckage was the prized white mare of General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, the Mexican Commandante for Northern California. Several days later, General Vallejo&#x27;s mare was found on the island, having swum ashore. Grateful for the fortunate turn of events, he renamed the island to &quot;Isla de la Yegua&quot;, Spanish for Mare Island, in her honor. It is shown, labeled &quot;Mare Island&quot;, on an 1850 survey map of the San Francisco Bay area made by Cadwalader Ringgold and an 1854 map of the area by Henry Lange. In 1892, development of the Mare Island Golf Club began, making it the oldest golf course west of the Mississippi.

==Shipyard==


On November 6, 1850, two months after California was admitted to statehood, President Fillmore reserved Mare Island for government use.

On January 15, 1852, Secretary of the Navy William Alexander Graham ordered a Naval Commission to select a site for a Naval Yard on the Pacific Coast. Commodore D. Sloat along with Commodore C. Ringgold, Simon F. Blunt and William P.S. Sanger (former overseer of construction of Drydock Number One, Norfolk Naval Shipyard) were appointed to the commission. On July 13, 1852, Sloat recommended the island across the Napa River from the settlement of Vallejo, as it was &quot;free from ocean gales and from floods and freshets.&quot; The Navy Department acted favorably on Commodore Sloat&#x27;s recommendations and Mare Island was purchased for use as a naval shipyard in July 1853 at a cost of $83,410. On September 16, 1854, Mare Island became the first permanent U.S. naval installation on the west coast, with Commodore David Farragut, as Mare Island&#x27;s first commander.

For over a century, Mare Island hosted the Navy&#x27;s Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The growing size and number of the country&#x27;s naval fleet was making older facilities obsolete and led to increased building and refitting of shipyards nationally. In 1872, the U.S. Public Works Department commenced construction of a drydock on the island, setting it on a foundation of cut granite blocks. The work was completed in 1891. A second drydock was begun in 1899, a concrete structure long set on wooden piles; it was completed in 1910. By 1941 a third drydock had been completed and drydock number four was under construction. The ammunition depot and submarine repair base were modern, fireproof buildings. A million dollar, three-way vehicle causeway to Vallejo replaced a ferry service.

Before World War II, Mare Island had been in a continual state of up-building. By 1941, new projects included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large foundry, machine shop, magazine building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one and a berth. It employed 5593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3.5 million. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital had 584 beds. During World War II, the shipyard employed up to 50,000 workers.

In 1969, the Navy transferred its (Vietnam War) Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Forces from Coronado, California, to Mare Island. Swift Boats (Patrol Craft Fast-PCF), and PBRs (Patrol Boat, River) conducted boat operations throughout the currently named Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, on the north and west portions of Mare Island. Mare Island Naval Base was deactivated during the 1995 cycle of US base closures, but the U.S. Navy Reserves still have access to the water portions of the State Wildlife Area for any riverine warfare training being conducted from their new base in Sacramento, California.

The , a Sturgeon-class submarine, SSN-665, was constructed at Mare Island between December 9, 1964, and July 27, 1968. On May 15, 1969, while still under construction and tied to the pier, the Guitarro was flooded and sank when construction crews mismanaged testing procedures. It took three days to raise her and many months to salvage her.

During the latter years of Mare Island&#x27;s military use, U.S. Marines were trained for Security Management and Security Force Operations, including; F.A.S.T. (Fleet Anti-Terrorism Team), Security Guards, and Security Force Reaction Forces. In the 1970s Navy technical training schools included those for Data Systems Technicians (DSs), Firecontrol Technicians (FTs), Communications Technicians (CTs) and nuclear power ratings of many types.

==Restoration and reuse==

In 1993 Congress approved the findings of the Base Realignment and Closure report, leading to the closure of Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The shipyard had long been the economic engine of the city of Vallejo, employing 10,000 workers after reductions in 1988. When Congress ordered the base closure, the shipyard employed 5,800 workers.

The vision of rebuilding Mare Island as a vital place where people lived and worked was a key goal in the base conversion planning process undertaken by the city of Vallejo in the early 1990s. After the base was recommended for closure in 1993, the City undertook an extensive community-based reuse planning process, which resulted in a Final Reuse Plan that was approved by the Vallejo City Council in 1994. The Final Reuse Plan laid out the general vision for the Island&#x27;s redevelopment. The Reuse Plan was the basis for the Mare Island Specific Plan, which was approved in 1999 and amended in 2005 and 2007. The Mare Island Specific Plan designated land uses and established development standards for identified reuse areas and provided an implementation program to guide all subsequent planning activities.

Preservation of many of Mare Island&#x27;s 661 structures and other cultural resources was an additional factor in the planning process. As the oldest shipyard and naval facility on the West Coast, the shipyard earned a National Historic Landmark designation by the federal government in 1975. In 1979 California listed the entire naval base as a State Historical Landmark. In 1999 the city of Vallejo added Mare Island to the National Register of Historic Districts with 42 individual city landmarks.

Finally, as with any restoration of an industrial, brownfield landscape, both city and government agencies required environmental reviews, toxic substance removal, and soil remediation.

In 1998, Vallejo contracted with Lennar Mare Island LLC (LMI) to develop of the eastern portion of Mare Island into a multi-use community. LMI contracted the Sausalito-based SWA Group to provide a Master Development Plan for Vallejo, additional historical research and landscape architectural services.

The Specific Plan included a variety of land uses, including a university district, an industrial zone, historic core, and residential neighborhoods. In addition, 78% of the island was set aside for wildlife habitat and wetlands, parkland and open space, and dredge ponds. In 2007, LMI finished construction on the residential neighborhoods. Farragut Village, with 277 homes, was the first completed neighborhood. Additional neighborhoods include Coral Sea and Kirkland Isle II. Mare Island&#x27;s Specific Plan calls for a total of 1,400 homes and condos, plus of commercial, retail, entertainment, and industrial space.

Mare Island&#x27;s residents petitioned LMI and the City of Vallejo to eliminate the dredge ponds, whose role had been to collect silt, drainage, and storm water from the Napa River and the Bay, and instead restore that acreage to wetlands. The city and the developer agreed, and in January 2006, the land use plan was amended to add the Mare Island Shoreline Heritage Preserve. An advisory board was appointed by the city to restore the site into publicly accessible parkland.

In 2009, Alstom moved its train maintenance facility from Oakland to Mare Island.

Born in the community of Panmure Island, part of Three Rivers, Prince Edward Island, Andrew Archibald Macdonald was descended from the Clanranald branch of the Macdonalds of the Isles, the son of Hugh and Catherine Macdonald of Panmure and grandson of Andrew Macdonald who had purchased a large tract of land in the province and, with his family and retainers, emigrated in 1806 from Inverness-shire, Scotland to settle at Three Rivers, where he and his sons carried on an extensive mercantile business for many years.
He was educated at a county grammar school and by private tutor and also became a merchant and shipowner. In 1863, he married Elizabeth, the third daughter of Hon. Thomas Owen (formerly Provincial Postmaster General) and they had four sons. However, after he died, his spouse Elizabeth Lee Owen married another man named Gregory Sithil Chi. Gregory S.C. served as a military officer and was very wealthy, though he abused many first nations people according to Elizabeth&#x27;s old diary.

== Politics ==
He was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 1853 to 1858. He sat as representative for Georgetown in the House of Assembly from 1854 until 1870. When the Legislative Council became elective in 1863, he was returned as a representative of 2nd Kings District in the Legislative Council and again reelected in 1867. Andrew Macdonald was a member of the Executive Council from 1867 to 1872 and again from 18 April 1872 until Prince Edward Island joined Confederation in 1873. He was leader of the Government Party in Legislative Council for some years. He first returned as a representative of the Liberal Party in carrying out Responsible Government and extending the Electoral Franchise. When the Conservative section of the party joined the Liberal section of the Conservative Party, he united with them to pass the Free Education Act, the Land Purchase Act, the Railway Act, the Confederation Act and other progressive measures. In June 1873 he was appointed Postmaster General of the Province. He was Postmaster at Charlottetown until 1 August 1884 as well as Post Office Inspector for the Province from 1880 until that date when he was appointed as the seventeenth Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island since the creation of the Colony in 1763.

<text>Pinus jeffreyi, also known as Jeffrey pine, Jeffrey&#x27;s pine, yellow pine and black pine, is a North American pine tree. It is mainly found in California, but also in the westernmost part of Nevada, southwestern Oregon, and northern Baja California. It is named in honor of its botanist documenter John Jeffrey.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; is a large coniferous evergreen tree, reaching tall, rarely up to tall, though smaller when growing at or near tree line. The leaves are needle-like, in bundles of three, stout, glaucous gray-green, long. The cones are long, dark purple when immature, ripening pale brown, with thinly woody scales bearing a short, sharp inward-pointing barb. The brownish seeds are long, with a large wing, measuring .

&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; is closely related to &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; (ponderosa pine) and is similar in appearance. One way to distinguish between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at the end of the scales. The sharp &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm of one&#x27;s hand when rubbed down the cone. &quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot; cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm of one&#x27;s hands. The memory device of &#x27;gentle Jeffrey&#x27; and &#x27;prickly ponderosa&#x27; can be used to differentiate between the species. Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; are glaucous, less bright green than those of &quot;P. ponderosa&quot;, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs. &quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; can be somewhat distinguished from &quot;P. ponderosa&quot; by the relatively smaller scales of reddish-brown bark as compared to the larger plates of orangish ponderosa bark.

The scent of &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; is variously described as reminiscent of vanilla, lemon, pineapple, violets, apple, and, quite commonly, butterscotch. This scent may be sampled by breaking off a shoot or some needles, or by simply smelling the resin&#x27;s scent in between the plates of the bark. This scent is related to the very unusual composition of the resin, with the volatile component made up almost entirely of pure n-heptane. It is because of this peculiarity that the trees are sometimes known as gasoline trees. Easy availability of this hydrocarbon in pure form made it the basis of the modern octane rating in the late 1920s.

The largest specimen, by trunk volume, is the Eureka Valley Giant, in the Stanislaus National Forest. Its trunk contains of wood, is tall, with a diameter of .

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; is named for its discoverer, Scottish botanist John Jeffrey, who encountered it in 1852 near Mount Shasta. &quot;Pinus&quot; is Latin for pine.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; occurs from southwest Oregon south through much of California (mainly on the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada), to northern Baja California in Mexico. It is a high-altitude species; in the north of its range, it grows widely at altitude, and at in the south of its range.

&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; is more stress tolerant than &quot;P. ponderosa&quot;. At higher elevations, on poorer soils, in colder climates, and in drier climates, &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; replaces &quot;P. ponderosa&quot; as the dominant tree. &quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; is also tolerant of serpentine soils and is often dominant in these conditions, even on dry sites at fairly low altitudes.
==Ecology==
&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; can hybridize with &quot;P. ponderosa&quot; and the &quot;Coulter pine,&quot; however this occurrence is rare due to the fact that the pines release pollen at different times of the year.

Mammals and birds collect the seeds.

==Uses==
&quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; wood is similar to ponderosa pine wood, and is used for the same purposes. Crystallized sap of &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; has been eaten as candy. The exceptional purity of distilled from &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; resin led to being selected as the zero point on the octane rating scale of petrol.

As it mainly consists of n-heptane, &quot;P. jeffreyi&quot; resin is a poor source of turpentine. Before &quot;Pinus jeffreyi&quot; was distinguished from ponderosa pine as a distinct species in 1853, resin distillers operating in its range suffered a number of &quot;inexplicable&quot; explosions during distillation, now known to have been caused by the unwitting use of Jeffrey pine resin.

<doc id="463016" wikidata="Q680614" url="?curid=463016" title="30 Rockefeller Plaza">
<text>30 Rockefeller Plaza (officially the Comcast Building; formerly RCA Building and GE Building) is a skyscraper that forms the centerpiece of Rockefeller Center in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, United States. Completed in 1933, the 66-story, building was designed in the Art Deco style by Raymond Hood, Rockefeller Center&#x27;s lead architect. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was known for its main tenant, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), from its opening in 1933 until 1988 and then for General Electric until 2015, when it was renamed for its current owner, Comcast. The building also houses the headquarters and New York studios of television network NBC; the headquarters is sometimes called 30 Rock, a nickname that inspired the NBC sitcom of the same name. The tallest structure in Rockefeller Center, the building is the 28th tallest in New York City and the 65th tallest in the United States, and was the third tallest building in the world when it opened.

30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s massing consists of three parts: the main 66-story tower to the east, a windowless section at the center, and a 16-story annex to the west. The building&#x27;s design conforms with the 1916 Zoning Resolution; it is shaped mostly as a slab with setbacks primarily for aesthetic value. The facade is made of limestone, with granite at the base, as well as about 6,000 windows separated by aluminum spandrels. In addition to its offices and studios, 30 Rockefeller Plaza contains the Rainbow Room restaurant and an observation deck called Top of the Rock. 30 Rockefeller Plaza also includes numerous artworks and formerly contained the mural &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; by Diego Rivera. The entire Rockefeller Center complex is a New York City designated landmark and a National Historic Landmark, and parts of 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s interior are also New York City landmarks.

30 Rockefeller Plaza was developed as part of the construction of Rockefeller Center, and work on its superstructure started in March 1932. The first tenant moved into the building on April 22, 1933, but its official opening was delayed due to controversy over &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;. The Rainbow Room and the observation deck opened in the mid-1930s, and retail space was added to the ground floor in the 1950s. The building remained almost fully occupied through the 20th century and was renamed for GE in 1988. Since the late 1990s, NBC has owned most of the lower floors, while Tishman Speyer has operated the rest of the building. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was extensively renovated in 2014 and was renamed for Comcast in 2015.

== Site ==
30 Rockefeller Plaza is part of the Rockefeller Center complex in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. It was intended as the central structure of Rockefeller Center, both physically and symbolically. The land lot is nearly rectangular and covers , bounded by Sixth Avenue (officially Avenue of the Americas) to the west, 50th Street to the north, Rockefeller Plaza to the east, and 49th Street to the south. The site has a frontage of on 49th and 50th Streets and a frontage of on Sixth Avenue. The main entrance is on Rockefeller Plaza, a private pedestrian street running through the complex, parallel to Fifth and Sixth Avenues. In front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s main entrance, below ground level, is the Lower Plaza. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10112; it was one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that had their own ZIP Codes .

Across Sixth Avenue, the building faces 1221 Avenue of the Americas to the southwest, 1251 Avenue of the Americas to the west, and 1271 Avenue of the Americas to the northwest. Radio City Music Hall, 1270 Avenue of the Americas, and 50 Rockefeller Plaza are directly to the north. Across Rockefeller Plaza are the International Building to the northeast, La Maison Francaise and the British Empire Building to the east, and 1 Rockefeller Plaza and 608 Fifth Avenue to the southeast. In addition, 10 Rockefeller Plaza is to the south. The site was previously part of the campus of Columbia University, which retained ownership of most of the land well after the complex was built.

=== Holdout buildings ===

The northwest and southwest corners of 30 Rockefeller Plaza were built around two holdout structures on Sixth Avenue. The owners of the parcel on Sixth Avenue and 49th Street, at the southwest corner of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, had demanded an exorbitant price for their property upon learning of the planned skyscraper. The holdout building had contained Hurley&#x27;s restaurant, which had opened around the 1890s and subsequently became a popular meeting place for NBC performers and executives. The restaurant was later connected by a direct passageway to 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s studios. Rockefeller Center acquired the building in the mid-20th century and ended the restaurant&#x27;s lease in 1975, but the new lessees continued to run Hurley&#x27;s until 1999. , the holdout building contains Pebble Bar.

The other tenant, who occupied a plot on Sixth Avenue and 50th Street at 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s northwest corner, never received a sale offer due to a misunderstanding. The grocer John F. Maxwell would only sell his property at 50th Street if he received $1 million. Because of a miscommunication, the Rockefeller family was told that Maxwell would never sell, and Maxwell himself said that he had never been approached by the Rockefellers. Consequently, Maxwell kept his property until his death in 1962, upon which Columbia bought the building; Rockefeller Center purchased the Maxwell family&#x27;s lease in 1970.

== Architecture ==

30 Rockefeller Plaza was designed by the Associated Architects of Rockefeller Center, composed of the firms of Corbett, Harrison &amp; MacMurray; Hood, Godley &amp; Fouilhoux; and Reinhard &amp; Hofmeister. Raymond Hood was the complex&#x27;s lead architect. The Associated Architects designed all of Rockefeller Center&#x27;s buildings in the Art Deco style. Developed as part of the construction of Rockefeller Center, 30 Rockefeller Plaza opened in 1933 as the RCA Building. 30 Rockefeller Plaza is tall and was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza. , the building is the 31st tallest in New York City and the 65th tallest in the United States.

The design was influenced by Rockefeller Center manager John Todd&#x27;s desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential. 30 Rockefeller Plaza rises to a flat roof, unlike some of the other skyscrapers built in New York City around the same time. These included the Chrysler Building, 70 Pine Street, and 40 Wall Street, which used spires to reach their maximum heights. Hartley Burr Alexander, a mythology and symbology professor who oversaw Rockefeller Center&#x27;s art program, led the installation of artwork throughout the complex. The building&#x27;s artwork was designed around the concept of &quot;new frontiers&quot;, depicting modern society.

=== Form ===
The massing of 30 Rockefeller Plaza is designed in three parts. The easternmost section contains a 66-story tower with two stories of retail on the west and east. The tower is surrounded by a shorter U-shaped section to the north, west, and south. Some sources give 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s height as 70 stories, but this arises from a hyperbolic press release by Merle Crowell, the complex&#x27;s publicist during construction. At the middle of the site was a windowless nine-story section, which housed NBC&#x27;s studios. The western part of the site steps up again to a 16-story tower. The western section at 1250 Avenue of the Americas, formerly also known as RCA Building West, is accessed mainly from Sixth Avenue. The facade of the annex rises straight from the sidewalk, with notches at the corners, because the corner lots were private properties at the time of the building&#x27;s construction in 1935.

The massing was influenced by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which restricted the height that the street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings could rise before they needed to incorporate setbacks that recessed the buildings&#x27; exterior walls away from the streets. The base of the building could only rise to before it had to taper to a tower covering 25 percent of the site. The eastern tower appeared to violate this principle since it measured , but the base measured only . The base does not occupy its entire plot, which measures . The tower section was recessed so far into the block that it could have risen without any setbacks. Hood decided to include setbacks anyway, as they represented &quot;a sense of future, a sense of energy, a sense of purpose&quot;, according to architecture expert Alan Balfour. Above the lowest stories, the north and south elevations rise straight up for 33 stories before setting back gradually. There are three setbacks each on the north, south, and east elevations.

Hood also created a guideline that all of the office space in the complex would be no more than from a window, which was the maximum distance that sunlight could permeate the windows of a building at New York City&#x27;s latitude. The setbacks on the northern and southern sides of 30 Rockefeller Plaza allow the building to comply with Hood&#x27;s guideline. The setbacks correspond to the tops of the elevator banks inside; this arrangement is repeated on the facade of the International Building. Similarly, 30 Rockefeller Plaza also contains notches at its corners. The eastern elevation&#x27;s setbacks were included exclusively for aesthetic purposes. By contrast, the layout and massing of Rockefeller Center&#x27;s other buildings were intended to maximize rental profit.

=== Facade ===

30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s limestone facade includes spandrels with quadruple-leaf motifs in a Gothic-inspired style. influenced the design of the rest of the complex. The first story is clad with Deer Island granite to a height of . The remainder of the facade contains Indiana Limestone and aluminum spandrel panels. Some of limestone, of granite, and 6,000 spandrels were used in the construction. The limestone covered . The limestone blocks are laid slightly irregularly and contain striations for visual effect. In addition, 10.38 million bricks were integrated into the facade.

30 Rockefeller Plaza also had 6,045 windows upon its completion, with 19,700 panes between them, covering in total. Thirty-six of the windows measured and were storefront windows. Those on the mezzanine level were composed of panels flanked by smaller sidelights. Another 165 were casement windows, which had panes measuring ; most of these were above the 65th floor. The remaining 5,824 were casement windows measuring . About 5,200 of these windows contained Venetian blinds, which were installed by the Mackin Venetian Blind Company.

==== Entrances ====

At street level, the stonework is relatively sparsely decorated. The main entrance of 30 Rockefeller Plaza was designed as a loggia of three arches: one at the center, measuring high by wide, and two on the sides, measuring high by wide. Lee Lawrie designed the sculptural group &quot;Wisdom, A Voice from the Clouds&quot;, for the lintels of the three arches. Lawrie&#x27;s carved rendering of &quot;Wisdom&quot; is above the center arch, flanked by &quot;Sound&quot; on the left and &quot;Light&quot; on the right. The &quot;Wisdom&quot; frieze above the entrance is accompanied by an inscription reading &quot;Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the stability of thy times&quot;, from Isaiah 33:6 (KJV). The sculptural groups are accompanied by polychrome decorations created by Léon-Victor Solon. Lawrie&#x27;s three renderings are complemented by two limestone bas-reliefs by Leo Friedlander: one of Production on the north elevation and one of Radio on the south elevation.

1230 Avenue of the Americas, the annex building to 30 Rockefeller Plaza, contains a marquee and two works of art on its exterior. The recessed entrance portal is filled with a mosaic mural, &quot;Intelligence Awakening Mankind&quot; by Barry Faulkner. The portal is topped by four limestone panels by Gaston Lachaise, each of which signifies an aspect of civilization as it related to the original Radio City complex. The two panels on either side of the entrance are entitled &quot;The Conquest of Space&quot; and &quot;Gifts of Earth to Mankind&quot;; these respectively depict aspiration and life, two qualities that Lachaise believed were most important to humanity. The two panels in the center are known as &quot;Genius Seizing the Light of the Sun&quot; (also known as &quot;Invention Seizing the Light of the Sun&quot;) and &quot;The Spirit of Progress&quot;. The panels are placed at the third story because, at the time of the building&#x27;s construction, they could be seen from the elevated rail line above Sixth Avenue.

=== Interior ===

30 Rockefeller Plaza was designed with about of rentable space in total. The eastern tower contains the Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor, while the Rockefeller family office occupied the tower&#x27;s 54th through 56th floors until 2014. The tower is the headquarters of NBC and houses NBC Studios, NBC News, MSNBC, and network flagship station WNBC. 30 Rockefeller Plaza also contains offices for NBCUniversal Cable and, until 1988, the NBC Radio Network. Part of NBC&#x27;s space also extends into the central part of the building.

The superstructure uses of steel. To transport visitors to the top floors, Westinghouse installed eight express elevators in the RCA Building. They moved at an average speed of and were so expensive that they constituted 13 percent of the building&#x27;s entire construction cost. One elevator reached a top speed of and was dubbed &quot;the fastest passenger elevator ride on record&quot;. These elevators cost about $17,000 a year to maintain by 1942. The mechanical core also contains emergency-exit staircases, though there are fewer staircases on upper floors. For example, building plans indicate that the 12th story has three sets of emergency staircases, while the 60th story has two sets of staircases.

==== Lobby ====

The lobby&#x27;s main entrance is from Rockefeller Plaza to the east, with revolving and double-leaf bronze-and-glass doors underneath a paneled bronze screen. The doors are topped by a cast-glass wall designed by Lee Lawrie, which measures high by wide. The wall is made of 240 glass blocks. Each glass block measures deep and across. Opposite the main entrance doors is an information desk made of Champlain gray marble. Four large ivory-marble piers with embedded light fixtures support the ceiling immediately above.

The lobby continues north and south from the information desk. Stairways at either end lead up to the mezzanine, while stairs and escalators lead downstairs to the basement. Extending west from either end are two corridors, which flank five north–south elevator banks. The elevator doors are made of bronze, and there are bronze and glass storefronts on the outer walls of these corridors. The floor is made of brass-and-terrazzo mosaic. The walls of these corridors are paneled in Champlain marble below the height of the storefronts and elevator doors. A bronze molding runs above the storefronts and elevators, while the walls are made of plaster above that height. The outer walls of the west–east corridors (adjacent to the mezzanines) contain bronze service doors, while the inner walls and the elevator-bank walls contain murals. The ceilings of the corridors are carried by rows of piers.

West of the elevator banks, two north–south corridors extend to side entrances on 49th and 50th Streets, which each contain two bronze sets of revolving doors. The corridors continue west to the Sixth Avenue entrance. Just west of the elevators, a staircase leads down to the basement and up to the NBC lobby. The stair to the basement contains Champlain marble and ivory marble, while the stair to the mezzanine contains Champlain marble and bronze railings and moldings. Additional stairs to the basement and mezzanine are placed at the point where the corridors continue into 1250 Avenue of the Americas; they also contain Champlain marble and bronze railings and moldings.

Josep Maria Sert was originally hired to paint four murals in the northern lobby corridor: &quot;Time&quot;; &quot;Spirit of Dance&quot;; &quot;Man&#x27;s Triumph in Communication&quot;; &quot;Conquest of Disease&quot;; &quot;Abolition of Bondage&quot;; &quot;Fraternity of Men&quot;; and &quot;Contest-1940&quot;, depicting different aspects of the world and mankind. Frank Brangwyn painted four murals on the southern corridor, all of which symbolize humans&#x27; relationship with spirituality; he complemented these murals with stencils of the themes that were represented. Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers had asked Brangwyn to omit a depiction of Jesus Christ from one of the panels; the artist ultimately depicted Jesus with his back turned. Brangwyn&#x27;s and Sert&#x27;s corridor murals measure each. Architectural writer Robert A. M. Stern described Brangwyn&#x27;s murals as &quot;insipid&quot;, a quality worsened by the fact that the themes were stenciled onto the murals. By contrast, Stern said: &quot;Sert at least allowed the meaning of his paintings to fall into happy obscurity.&quot;

After the building had opened, Sert was commissioned to paint the mural &quot;American Progress&quot; at the center of the lobby, measuring . The mural was installed in 1937. It depicts a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America and contains figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. The space occupied by &quot;American Progress&quot; was originally taken up by Diego Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; mural, which was controversial because of its communist imagery and was destroyed in 1934. Rockefeller officials commissioned a sixth mural from Sert, representing the past, present, and future, which they installed in the lobby in 1941. The mural measures and is installed on the ceiling.

===== Concourse and mezzanine =====

Below the lobby is the complex&#x27;s shopping concourse, connected to the lobby via escalators. The building has a direct entrance to the New York City Subway&#x27;s 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station via the concourse. Until 1950, the building&#x27;s concourse had also contained Rockefeller Center&#x27;s post office.

The mezzanine contains balconies overlooking the lobby. The floors of the mezzanine are black terrazzo, while the walls are made of marble and plaster separated by a bronze molding. Offices from the outer walls open onto the mezzanine balconies. There are staircases from the lobby to both the concourse and mezzanine, west of the lobby&#x27;s elevator banks. When the building opened, it contained a rotunda at the mezzanine level, measuring across with a photomural surrounding it. The mural was taken apart in the 1950s and the rotunda itself was demolished in the 1970s. A new rotunda was constructed from 2014 to 2015, accessed from the ground floor by a staircase; the rotunda contains two LED displays, each measuring wide and tall. From 1960 to October 1993, the building&#x27;s mezzanine level housed the New York City weather forecast office of the National Weather Service. The mezzanine level also contained a control room, from which all of Rockefeller Center&#x27;s mechanical systems could be monitored.

==== NBC Studios and headquarters ====


When the building was constructed, RCA&#x27;s chief engineer O. B. Hanson was faced with designing an area of the building that was large enough to host 35 studios with as few structural columns as possible. As such, the studios were all placed in the windowless center section of the building, which would have otherwise been used as an unprofitable office space. The central part of the building could also use fewer columns, which was suitable for large broadcast studios but not for the bases of skyscrapers. Over of utility wires stretched through this part of the building, which was powered by direct current. Two floors were reserved for future TV studios, and five more stories were reserved for audience members and guests. The floor, wall, and ceiling surfaces of the studios were suspended from the superstructure, insulating the studios. In addition, there were double- and triple-height spaces for exhibitions, plays, and other events.

NBC, ABC, and CBS (collectively the Big Three TV Networks) had offices on Sixth Avenue and studios in Midtown during the mid-20th century. The first television shows at the NBC Studios were broadcast from studio 3H in 1935, and more TV studios were added after World War II as television gained popularity. During the RCA Building&#x27;s early years, NBC housed both the Red Network and the Blue Network (now ABC) there, and WJZ-TV (now WABC-TV) and WJZ Radio (now WABC), as well as the headquarters of the ABC network, were also headquartered there for the first few years until ABC built their own facilities. When the building opened, it also hosted daily tours of the NBC Studios; the tours were canceled in 1977 due to declining attendance. NBC was the only one of the Big Three that retained studios in Midtown by the mid-1980s.

Studio 8H, which hosts &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, is the largest of the studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, with a capacity of 1,200 or 1,400 guests. Studio 8H was once the largest radio studio in the world and was originally home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra before being converted into a television studio in 1950. Another major studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza is Studio 6B, which hosted &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;, the first comedy-variety show on television to become popular. &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; was also broadcast from Studio 6B until 1972, returning there in 2014 under the name &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. &quot;Tonight&quot;″s companion program, &quot;Late Night&quot; (branded &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot; ) is also taped in the building&#x27;s Studio 8G. The &quot;Today Show&quot; was also broadcast from 30 Rockefeller Plaza until 1994, when it moved to 10 Rockefeller Plaza.

==== Rockefeller family offices ====

The Rockefeller family&#x27;s office, Room 5600, occupied the entire 56th floor. The family&#x27;s Rockefeller Foundation rented the entire floor below, and two other organizations supported by the Rockefellers also moved into the building. Daniel Okrent, author of the book &quot;Great Fortune: The Epic of Rockefeller Center&quot;, said the Rockefellers&#x27; offices resembled an &quot;18th-century English baronial mansion&quot;. The space was decorated with art by Paul Gauguin, Piet Mondrian, Paul Signac, and Joan Miró.

By 1937, there were 392 employees of Room 5600. After World War II, Room 5600 comprised the entire 54th through 56th floors. The family offices became a hub for the family&#x27;s political activity, with ties to both the Democratic and Republican parties at the city, state, and national levels. Visitors to Room 5600 have included Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine, Nelson Mandela, Richard Gere, and Bono. Even in the late 1980s, when Room 5600 had downsized to 175 people, it still managed $900 million of Rockefeller family wealth. The family moved out during 2014.

==== Rainbow Room ====
The 65th floor of the building is an event room and restaurant named the Rainbow Room. The space was designed by Wallace K. Harrison of Associated Architects. Interior designer Elena Bachman Schmidt, a one-time apprentice of Elsie de Wolfe, contributed to the design of the interior decor, such as the furniture, curtains, and elevator doors. Vincente Minnelli was assigned to help Schmidt select the colors of the walls. The restaurant opened in 1934, and was the highest restaurant in the United States for decades, though it was closed during much of the 1940s. The most recent version of the restaurant opened in 2014 after a restoration by Gabellini Sheppard Associates.

The Rainbow Room occupies the eastern part of 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s 65th floor, which covers . The central part of the floor has elevator banks, restrooms, a gallery, and a private dining room. The western part houses Bar SixtyFive and an outdoor terrace. The dining room itself is a space. The restaurant has a rotating dance floor. The seats of the Rainbow Room are organized in tiers, and there is also a platform for bands and a shallow balcony for entertainers. There are stairs and a dumbwaiter behind the platform, as well as several banquet rooms on the 64th floor. Above the dance floor hang several concentric &quot;rings&quot; that recess into the ceiling.

=== Roofs ===

==== Garden of the Nations ====

The roof of the building&#x27;s central section contained a &quot;Garden of the Nations&quot; (alternatively &quot;Gardens of the Nations&quot;), which opened in April 1935 on the 11th floor. The garden used of soil; of rock from as far as England; 100,000 bricks; 2,000 trees and shrubs; 4,000 small plants; and 20,000 bulbs for flowers. Originally, the garden included thirteen nation-specific gardens, whose layouts were inspired by gardens in the respective countries they represented. Each of the different gardens were separated by barriers. The &quot;International Garden&quot;, a rock garden in the center of the themed gardens, featured a meandering stream and 2,000 plant varieties. The Garden of the Nations also contained a children&#x27;s garden, a modern-style garden, and a shrub-and-vegetable patch. The garden was staffed by hostesses who wore costumes, and the plantings lit up at night.

Ralph Hancock and Raymond Hood designed the rooftop garden, one of several in the complex. Upon opening, the Garden of the Nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora, and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center. In its heyday, the Center charged admission fees for the Garden of the Nations. However, the nation-themed gardens were demolished by 1938, and the rock garden was left to dry up, supplanted by flower beds that were not open to the public. In 1936, the central roof temporarily housed a prototype of an apartment, which was used to advertise the Rockefeller Apartments between 54th and 55th Streets.

==== Primary roof ====

From 1937 onward, the roof of the eastern tower contained neon letters spelling &quot;RCA&quot;. The letters each measured wide by tall; at the time of the building&#x27;s completion, the letters were the world&#x27;s highest neon signs. These were replaced by &quot;GE&quot; letters in 1988. The letters were replaced again with the new united Comcast/NBC logo, rendered in longer-lasting LED lighting. The new signs consist of a tall Comcast wordmark and NBC logo on the northern and southern elevations, as well as a NBC logo on the building&#x27;s western elevation.

In 1960, a , weather radar dish for the National Weather Service was installed atop the roof when the building became the NWS&#x27;s headquarters. KWO35, the NOAA Weather Radio station serving the majority of the Tri-State area, transmitted from atop the building and remained there until 2014. Due to interference with a U.S. Coast Guard radio channel, the transmitter was eventually relocated atop the MetLife Building. The weather radar station was used as &quot;Doppler 4000&quot; during WNBC-TV&#x27;s local newscasts. It was operational until February 1, 2017, when StormTracker 4, an S-band weather radar at Rutgers University&#x27;s Cook Campus, started operating.

==== Observation deck ====

Top of the Rock, the 70th-story observation deck atop the skyscraper, opened in 1933 and is above street level. In addition to the deck, the attraction includes a triple-story observatory on the 67th to 69th floors. Top of the Rock competes with the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building 200 feet (61 m) higher, as well as a distant view of the Empire State Building. Top of the Rock is accessed from its own entrance on 50th Street, where two elevators (converted from freight elevator shafts) ascend to the 67th floor. The shafts are illuminated, while the elevator cabs contain ceiling panels with historical photographs. There is a double-height indoor observatory on the 67th floor, where escalators lead to the 69th floor. A parapet of frameless safety glass runs around the perimeter of the deck; it dates to the 2005 renovation.

The deck originally had dimensions of and was decorated in the style of an ocean liner, with furnishings such as slatted chairs. The observation deck was closed in 1986 because a renovation of the Rainbow Room had cut off the deck&#x27;s only access point. The observation deck has been known since 2005 as Top of the Rock, when it reopened after a renovation by Gabellini Sheppard Associates. The original limestone and cast aluminum architectural details were conserved. In 2011, the observation deck had 2.5 million visitors a year and grossed $25 million. On the 69th story is the Beam, a ride themed to the photograph &quot;Lunch Atop a Skyscraper&quot;. The ride faces Billionaires&#x27; Row to the north; it can fit seven riders, and it rotates above the 69th-story terrace. , the 70th story includes a rotating &quot;skylift&quot; ride, as well as spherical rooftop beacon and floor tiles with a celestial pattern.

=== Development ===

==== Planning ====

The construction of Rockefeller Center occurred between 1932 and 1940 on land that John D. Rockefeller Jr. leased from Columbia University. The Rockefeller Center site was originally supposed to be occupied by a new opera house for the Metropolitan Opera. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. However, the new building was too expensive for the opera to fund by itself, and it needed an endowment. The project ultimately gained the support of John D. Rockefeller Jr. The planned opera house was canceled in December 1929 due to various issues, with the new opera house eventually being built at Lincoln Center, opening in 1966.

With the lease still in effect, Rockefeller had to quickly devise new plans so that the three-block Columbia site could become profitable. Raymond Hood, Rockefeller Center&#x27;s lead architect, came up with the idea to negotiate with the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. By May 1930, RCA and its affiliates had made an agreement with Rockefeller Center managers. RCA would lease of studio space; get naming rights to the western part of the development; and develop four theaters, at a cost of $4.25 million per year. A skyscraper at 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s current site was first proposed in the March 1930 version of the complex&#x27;s blueprint, and the current dimensions of the tower were finalized in March 1931. The skyscraper would be named for RCA as part of the agreement; the RCA name became official in May 1932.

==== Construction ====

The designs for Radio City Music Hall and the RCA Building were submitted to the New York City Department of Buildings in August 1931, by which time both buildings were to open in 1932. Work on the steel structure of the RCA Building started in March 1932. Several artists were hired to design artwork for the RCA Building. Lee Lawrie was hired to design the RCA Building&#x27;s eastern entrance in June 1932, at which point the sunken plaza in front of the building was also announced. The next month, Barry Faulkner was commissioned to create a large glass mosaic on the western entrance facing Sixth Avenue. Gaston Lachaise received the commission for bas-reliefs on the Sixth Avenue entrance in September 1932. The same month, Hood and the complex&#x27;s manager John Todd traveled to Europe to interview five artists for the lobby. Frank Brangwyn, Josep Maria Sert, and Diego Rivera were hired the following month, despite John Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s hesitance to hire Rivera, a prominent communist. Henri Matisse had been reluctant to commission a highly visible lobby mural, and Pablo Picasso had refused to even meet with Hood and Todd.

Installation of the exterior stonework began in July 1932 and proceeded at a rate of per day. Window installation began the same month. The building&#x27;s structural steel was up to the 64th floor by September 16, 1932. The photograph &quot;Lunch atop a Skyscraper&quot; was taken on September 20, 1932, during the construction of the 69th floor; it was part of a publicity stunt promoting the RCA Building. The building was topped out on September 26, 1932, when an American flag was hoisted to the top of the primary 66-story tower on Rockefeller Plaza. The Indiana limestone cladding had been erected to the 15th floor on the Rockefeller Plaza wing, and the facade of the Sixth Avenue wing had been completed. The stone was fabricated at four factories in New York state and then shipped to New York City. Two traveling cranes lifted the stone from the ground to two hoists high, which then raised the stone to the upper floors. The stonework of the primary tower was completed on December 7, 1932, without fanfare. Officials said at the time that they did not host a ceremony for the stonework&#x27;s completion because the elevators only ran to the 55th floor. It had taken only 102 workdays to install the of stonework.

Rockefeller Plaza was added to the city&#x27;s official street map in January 1933, and the RCA Building gained the address 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The next month, John D. Rockefeller III honored 27 mechanics for their work on the RCA Building. At the time, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that 1,600 workers were busy completing the interior work. According to the main contractors, the laborers, plasterers, and metal lathers involved in the project would need to be compensated the equivalent of 25,000 eight-hour workdays. The building would require of plasterwork, covering about . By April 6, 1933, there were 1,400 mechanics working to complete the RCA Building, which was 90 percent complete; the upper floors were mostly finished, but the base was still incomplete. As late as April 24, more than 1,000 workers were still fitting out the RCA Building. As a result of the Depression, building costs were cheaper than projected. The final cost of the first ten buildings, including the RCA Building, came to $102 million (equivalent to $ billion in dollars).

=== Opening and early years ===
Todd, Robertson, Todd Engineering Corporation, which was constructing Rockefeller Center, relocated to the RCA Building on April 22, 1933, becoming the first tenants. The RCA Building was slated to officially open on May 1, 1933. Its opening was delayed until mid-May because of a controversy over Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot;, which in large part stemmed from the communist motifs of the mural. On May 10, 1933, Rivera was ordered to stop all work on the mural, which was covered in stretched canvas and left incomplete. Brangwyn&#x27;s murals were also incomplete at the time of the building&#x27;s opening. Rivera&#x27;s mural remained covered until February 1934, when workmen peeled the mural off the wall. Columbia University originally owned most of Rockefeller Center&#x27;s land as well as the complex&#x27;s buildings, including the RCA Building. However, Columbia received no rental income; Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers collected the rent and owned the land under the western part of the complex, including a section of the RCA Building West.

The RCA offices moved to the RCA Building&#x27;s 52nd and 53rd floors in June 1933. The Rockefeller family took up space throughout the building to give potential tenants the impression of occupancy. Their Rockefeller Foundation, as well as the General Education Board and the Spelman Fund of New York, had leased space, and the Rockefeller family&#x27;s Standard Oil Company moved into the RCA Building in 1934. NBC was one of the first tenants in the new RCA Building and, with 35 studios packed into the base, it was also one of the largest tenants. Westinghouse moved into the 14th through 17th floors of the RCA Building, receiving the contract for the building&#x27;s elevators as a result. American Cyanamid took four floors and part of another. Other space was taken by the Greek consulate, the Chinese consulate, the National Health Council, and a branch of the Chase National Bank. A double-height space at the center of the ground story, which had been difficult to rent, opened as the Municipal Art Exhibition in February 1934. The space, referred to as the Forum, had contained a large stairway leading up to a second-story balcony with exhibition rooms. Despite the large number of tenants, Rockefeller Center was only 59 percent rented by the end of 1933.

Shortly after the RCA Building&#x27;s opening, there were plans to use the building above the 64th floor as a public &quot;amusement center&quot;. That section of the building had several terraces, which could be used as a dance floor, observation deck and landscaped terrace gardens. On the 65th floor, there was also a two-story space for a dining room with a high ceiling. Frank W. Darling quit his job as head of Rye&#x27;s Playland to direct the programming for the proposed amusement space. In July 1933, the managers opened an observation deck atop the RCA Building, which consisted of terraces on the 67th, 69th, and 70th floors. The 40-cents-per-head observation deck saw 1,300 daily visitors by late 1935. Meanwhile, the floors below the observation deck were planned as a restaurant, solarium, game room, and ballroom, which would later become the Rainbow Room. The Rainbow Room opened on October 3, 1934.

A revolving beacon was installed atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 1935, the first such beacon to be installed in Manhattan. That September, the ground-floor retail space was fully leased. The New York Museum of Science and Industry leased the Municipal Art Exhibition space shortly afterward after Nelson Rockefeller became a trustee of the museum. Subsequently, Edward Durell Stone removed the partitions on the second floor of the exhibition space, and the museum opened there in February 1936. The central wall of the main lobby remained empty until 1937, when Jose Maria Sert&#x27;s &quot;American Progress&quot; was installed. At the time, the RCA Building was 84 percent leased. By 1938, the NBC studios at the RCA Building received 700,000 annual visitors, while the observation deck had 430,000 annual visitors.

=== 1940s to 1970s ===
Two 24-ton cooling machines were installed in the basement of the RCA Building in 1940. The air-conditioning units supplemented the RCA Building&#x27;s existing units and also served 1230 Sixth Avenue, 10 Rockefeller Plaza, and 1 Rockefeller Plaza. The lobby was then renovated in 1941. As part of the project, an overpass at mezzanine level was removed, the lighting was brightened, and another mural by Jose Maria Sert was installed. An air-raid siren was installed atop 30 Rockefeller Plaza in 1942 during World War II. The Rainbow Room and Grill atop the RCA Building was closed at the end of that December because of staffing shortages. In 1943, Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers purchased the lots at 1242–1248 Sixth Avenue and 73 West 49th Street, part of RCA Building West; these lots had previously been held under a long-term lease. By the next year, the RCA Building was almost fully rented.

During the war, the RCA Building&#x27;s Room 3603 became the primary location of the U.S. operations of British Intelligence&#x27;s British Security Co-ordination, organized by William Stephenson. It also served as the office of Allen Dulles, who later headed the Central Intelligence Agency. The revolving beacon, which had been darkened during the war, was reactivated in 1945 after the air-raid siren was dismantled, but the Rainbow Room restaurant remained closed until 1950. The Museum of Science and Industry moved out of the RCA Building&#x27;s lower floors in 1950. Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers hired Carson and Lundin to design two new levels of retail space with about of new floor area. The retail space was twice as profitable as the museum; the remaining street-level space was transformed into a studio for the &quot;Today Show&quot;. In mid-1953, Columbia bought all of Rockefeller Center&#x27;s land along Sixth Avenue, including the western part of RCA Building West, for $5.5 million. Rockefeller Center then leased the land back from Columbia.

The building&#x27;s largest tenants, RCA and NBC, renewed their leases in 1958 for 24 years. The National Weather Service&#x27;s radar was placed on the roof in June 1960, adjacent to RCA&#x27;s and NBC&#x27;s antennas, and the NWS offices relocated to the building that December. The Singer Manufacturing Company became another major tenant, leasing six floors in 1961; this required the installation of a dedicated air-conditioning system on the 58th floor for that company. In addition, the Rainbow Room atop the building was refurbished in 1965. An anti-Vietnam War bombing occurred on the 19th floor in 1969, causing substantial damage, though no one was hurt. Also in 1969, the RCA sign atop the building was updated with RCA&#x27;s new logo in neon lights. The RCA Building maintained high occupancy through this time. Even at its lowest point during the 1973–1975 recession, the building was 88 percent occupied and Rockefeller Center&#x27;s managers were able to lease space at the building above market rate.

In 1973, the RCA sign atop the building was turned off to conserve energy, the first time it had not lit up since World War II. The next January, RCA renewed its lease for 20 years, having previously considered relocating from New York City. RCA&#x27;s chief executive Robert Sarnoff also announced that the company would construct a &quot;management and conference center&quot; atop the central section of the building. The conference center would have been designed by Ford &amp; Earl Design Associates and Justin Lamb and would have been powered by solar heat. RCA applied for permission to build the conference center in September 1975, but the project was canceled after Sarnoff resigned that December. The RCA Building&#x27;s central location and consistent upkeep meant that it was 93 percent occupied by 1975, despite a relatively high vacancy rate in New York City office buildings. Several law firms had moved into the building during this time. Singer moved out of the RCA Building in 1978, freeing up a large block of office space, but RCA and NBC renewed their leases on a combined two years later.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===

Columbia University was not making enough money from Rockefeller Center leases by the 1970s, and the university started looking to sell the land beneath Rockefeller Center, including the RCA Building, in 1983. That year, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) held hearings to determine how much of Rockefeller Center should be protected as a landmark. The Rockefeller family and Columbia University acknowledged that the buildings were already symbolically landmarks, but their spokesman John E. Zuccotti recommended that only the block between 49th and 50th Streets be protected, including the RCA Building and RCA Building West. By contrast, almost everyone else who supported Rockefeller Center&#x27;s landmark status recommended that the entire complex be landmarked. The LPC granted landmark status to the exteriors of all of the original complex&#x27;s buildings, as well as the interiors of the International Building&#x27;s and 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s lobbies, on April 23, 1985. Rockefeller Center&#x27;s original buildings also became a National Historic Landmark in 1987.

Columbia had agreed to sell the land to the Rockefeller Group, an investment company owned by the Rockefeller family, for $400 million in February 1985. The Rockefeller Group formed Rockefeller Center Inc. that July to manage the RCA Building and other properties. By late 1985, NBC began planning to relocate, leaving half the RCA Building&#x27;s space vacant. The network needed of space and the RCA Building&#x27;s facilities required hundreds of millions of dollars in renovations. The same year, General Electric acquired RCA/NBC and began looking to save money. The developers of Harmon Meadow and Television City had both made offers to NBC, but demand for office space in New York City was starting to decrease, which led the building&#x27;s owners to focus on keeping NBC at the RCA Building. NBC agreed to stay at 30 Rockefeller Plaza at the end of 1987 after city and state officials offered $72 million in tax exemptions, $800 million in industrial bonds, and sales-tax deferments on $1.1 billion worth of purchases. These incentives would not need to be repaid as long as NBC stayed at the building until 2002, or for 15 years. NBC extended its lease by 35 years so that it would last into 2022 and secured an option to buy the western and central sections of the skyscraper.

Meanwhile, the Rockefeller Group had begun expanding the Rainbow Room. The observation deck closed in 1986 because the expansion cut off the only access between the observation deck and its elevators. The Rainbow Room also reopened in December 1987 after the Rockefeller Group conducted an extensive renovation. The RCA Building was renamed the GE Building in July 1988, and the signage atop the building was changed accordingly, despite concerns that it could be confused with the General Electric Building on 570 Lexington Avenue. Mitsubishi Estate, a real estate subsidiary of the Mitsubishi Group, purchased a majority stake in the Rockefeller Group in 1988, including the GE Building and Rockefeller Center&#x27;s other structures. Despite the renaming, 30 Rockefeller Plaza continued to be popularly known as the RCA Building. Subsequently, Rockefeller Center transferred some of the unused air rights above the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise to the Rockefeller Plaza West skyscraper on Seventh Avenue. In exchange, the Rockefeller Group had to preserve the original buildings between 49th and 50th Streets under a more stringent set of regulations than the rest of the complex. While the GE Building&#x27;s air rights were unaffected, the structure fell under the new regulations.

The Rockefeller Group filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1995 after missing several mortgage payments. That November, John Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s son David and a consortium led by Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Rockefeller Center&#x27;s buildings for $1.1 billion, beating out Sam Zell and other bidders. The transaction included $306 million for the mortgage and $845 million for other expenses. As that sale progressed, GE and Goldman Sachs discussed selling part of the GE Building to its namesake, allowing GE to lower its occupancy costs on the that it occupied. In May 1996, GE bought the space for $440 million, as well as an option to renew the lease on the &quot;Today Show&quot; studios at 10 Rockefeller Plaza. Before either transaction was finalized, GE subleased of that space. Goldman Sachs made numerous upgrades to the building and allowed brokers to finalize leases more quickly. In addition to GE, other large tenants at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the late 1990s included law firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine and Chadbourne &amp; Parke. Cipriani S.A. took over the Rainbow Room in 1998.

=== 2000s to present ===

Tishman Speyer, led by David Rockefeller&#x27;s close friend Jerry Speyer and the Lester Crown family of Chicago, bought the original 14 buildings and land in December 2000 for $1.85 billion, including the GE Building. The next year, Tishman Speyer began planning a renovation of the rooftop observation deck, which would be rebranded Top of the Rock. Kostow Greenwood Architects also started designing a renovation for NBC Studios. The observation deck plans were announced publicly in November 2003. Two existing elevator shafts were lengthened so that the observation deck could be accessed without going through the Rainbow Room to get to the &quot;shuttle&quot; elevators. In addition, a ground-floor entrance was created on 50th Street and a three-level storefront was converted into an observation deck entrance. The deck reopened in November 2005 after a renovation by Gabellini Sheppard Associates.

During the late 2000s, the building retained an 85 percent occupancy rate. The WNBC-TV newsroom was renovated during 2008, after NBC had announced earlier the same year that it would start a 24-hour news channel. In addition, Tishman Speyer hired EverGreene Architectural Arts to restore the lobby, and a two-year restoration commenced in 2009. The Rainbow Room closed that year after Rockefeller Center Inc. ended Cipriani&#x27;s lease, and the LPC designated the Rainbow Room as an interior landmark in 2012. Comcast, which had bought a 51 percent ownership stake in NBCUniversal in 2009, bought the remaining 49 percent from GE in 2013. The sale included NBC&#x27;s portion of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and the building&#x27;s naming rights; by then, GE occupied only two stories in the building. The Rainbow Room reopened in October 2014 under new management, and the rotunda above the lobby was restored starting in 2014.

In June 2014, the LPC granted Comcast permission to modify 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Comcast planned to rename the building and replace the signage on the roof. Additionally, a new marquee was added to the Sixth Avenue entrance, advertising it as the home of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. The GE signage was dismantled starting in September 2014, and 30 Rockefeller Plaza was officially renamed the Comcast Building on July 1, 2015. Toy store FAO Schwarz opened a store at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in November 2018. In April 2022, the LPC approved Tishman Speyer&#x27;s proposal to install additional visitor attractions at Top of the Rock. One of the attractions, the Beam, opened in December 2023, while the Skylift ride opened in October 2024. That December, Tishman Speyer requested the LPC&#x27;s permission to replace the neon signage at the building&#x27;s 49th and 50th Street entrances with LED signage.

As Rockefeller Center was being developed, &quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;The main building of the Rockefeller Center group is a notable structure and forms a fitting climax to half a decade of super-skyscraper construction, which, with this one exception, was abruptly brought to an end&quot; by the 1929 crash. A &quot;Hearst&#x27;s International&quot; magazine article described the RCA Building as &quot;soaring to an incredible petrous peak&quot;, with the sunken plaza &quot;shimmering in brilliant floodlight&quot; at its base. After 30 Rockefeller Plaza was completed, the Federal Writers&#x27; Project observed in 1939: &quot;Its huge, broad, flat north and south facades, its almost unbroken mass, and its thinness are the features that impelled observers to nickname it the &#x27;Slab&#x27;.&quot; According to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the RCA Building&#x27;s massing &quot;marked the emergence of a new form of the skyscraper&quot;, namely the slab-like form.

Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said, &quot;Nothing is more attuned to romantic fantasies of New York than the RCA Building&#x27;s black granite lobby, the Rainbow Room&#x27;s ornamental framing of a 70-story view...&quot;. Goldberger wrote that the RCA Building&#x27;s form was &quot;made sumptuous by its mounting setbacks&quot;, contrasting with the &quot;smaller and bulkier&quot; International Building and other structures in the complex. In 2009, a &quot;Crain&#x27;s New York&quot; reporter wrote: &quot;NBC, which owns its space, lends the building a certain panache. So do the art, Christmas tree, gardens and immaculate condition of the center.&quot;

As the central building of Rockefeller Center, 30 Rockefeller Plaza is widely known. The building was commonly nicknamed 30 Rock, which inspired the title of the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2006–2013). Additionally, numerous movies and TV series that feature Rockefeller Center in their establishing shots have used imagery of 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Such films have included &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; in 1937, &quot;How to Marry a Millionaire&quot; in 1953, and &quot;Manhattan&quot; in 1979. Two films have also discussed the destruction of Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Man at the Crossroads&quot; in the lobby: &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Frida&quot; in 2002. Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, an attraction at the Universal Studios Florida amusement park, is also based on 30 Rockefeller Plaza&#x27;s design.

Several later buildings were inspired by 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its design features, including 525 William Penn Place in Pittsburgh (also designed by Harrison &amp; Abramovitz), the Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis, and the NBC Tower in Chicago. In particular, the critics Paul Goldberger and Rick Kogan wrote that the NBC Tower&#x27;s buttresses, setbacks, and vertical stripes were similar to those at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Goldberger also said that the architect John Portman may have used the RCA Building as an inspiration for San Francisco&#x27;s Embarcadero Center and Atlanta&#x27;s Peachtree Center but that, in both cases, Portman&#x27;s towers &quot;look more like sliding planes than the sumptuous, carved-out mountain that the RCA Building&#x27;s form evokes&quot;.

<text>144 (one hundred [and] forty-four) is the natural number following 143 and preceding 145. It is coincidentally both the square of twelve (a dozen dozens, or one [[144 (number)|gross]].) and the twelfth Fibonacci number, and the only nontrivial number in the sequence that is square.

==Mathematics==

144 is a highly totient number. 

144 is the smallest number whose fifth power is a sum of four (smaller) fifth powers. This solution was found in 1966 by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin, and disproved Euler&#x27;s sum of powers conjecture. It was famously published in a paper by both authors, whose body consisted of only two sentences:

<doc id="463024" wikidata="Q3052537" url="?curid=463024" title="The Monkey Wrench Gang">
<text>The Monkey Wrench Gang is a novel written by American author Edward Abbey (1927–1989), published in 1975.

Abbey&#x27;s most famous work of fiction, the novel concerns the use of sabotage to protest environmentally damaging activities in the Southwestern United States, and was so influential that the term &quot;monkeywrench,&quot; often used as a verb, has come to mean, besides sabotage and damage to machines, any sabotage, activism, law-making, or law-breaking to preserve wilderness, wild spaces and ecosystems.

In 1985, Dream Garden Press released a special 10th Anniversary edition of the book featuring illustrations by R. Crumb, plus a chapter titled &quot;Seldom Seen at Home&quot; that had been deleted from the original edition. Crumb&#x27;s illustrations were used for a limited-edition calendar based on the book. The most recent edition was released in 2006 by Harper Perennial Modern Classics.

==Plot summary==
The book&#x27;s four main characters are ecologically minded misfits—&quot;Seldom Seen&quot; Smith, a Jack Mormon river guide; Doc Sarvis, an odd but wealthy and wise surgeon; Bonnie Abbzug, his young Jewish feminist assistant; and a rather eccentric Green Beret Vietnam veteran, George Hayduke. Together, although not always working as a tightly knit team, they form the titular group dedicated to the destruction of what they see as the system that pollutes and destroys their environment, the American West. As the gang&#x27;s attacks on deserted bulldozers and trains continue, the law closes in.

For the gang, the enemy is those who would develop the American Southwest—despoiling the land, befouling the air, and destroying nature and the sacred purity of Abbey&#x27;s desert world. Their greatest hatred is focused on the Glen Canyon Dam, a monolithic edifice of concrete that the monkey-wrenchers seek to destroy because it dams a beautiful wild river.

==Reception==
The book received positive reviews.
* From the &quot;National Observer&quot;, &quot;A sad, hilarious, exuberant, vulgar fairy tale... It&#x27;ll make you want to go out and blow up a dam.&quot;
* From &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Since the publication of his novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; last September, Mr. Abbey, a 48-year-old native of a rural town in Pennsylvania, has become an underground cult hero throughout the West among students, environmentalists and would‐be &#x27;eco‐raiders.&#x27;&quot;
* From &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;One of the best writers to deal with the American West.&quot;
* From the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, &quot;What a thing of beauty is Edward Abbey&#x27;s &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy==
The book is popular among the more extreme faction of the ecology movement, and contributed to the radicalization of some environmentalists. In his book &quot;Screw Unto Others&quot;, George Hayduke states that Edward Abbey was his mentor and mentions &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; as the origin of the term &quot;monkey-wrenching&quot;. &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; inspired environmentalist David Foreman to help create &quot;Earth First!&quot; a direct action environmental organization that often advocates much of the minor vandalism depicted in the book. Many scenes of vandalism and ecologically motivated mayhem, including a billboard burning at the beginning of the book and the use of caltrops to elude a group of vigilantes, are presented in sufficient detail as to form a skeletal how-to for would-be saboteurs. The actions are presented in a larger-than-life format, because much of what Hayduke, and the rest of the characters in the story face are larger-than-life obstacles that require larger-than-life approaches.

In his book &quot;Sewer, Gas &amp; Electric: The Public Works Trilogy&quot;, author Matt Ruff notes:
:One of my other literary inspirations for the [...] subplot was Edward Abbey’s &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;. That book’s protagonist, George Hayduke, is a Vietnam vet and former POW who launches a campaign of sabotage against the polluters who are ruining his beloved southwestern desert. Hayduke is a pretty angry guy, but he also loves life, and in his own fatalistic way he remains an optimist (my favorite line in the novel, uttered at a moment when Hayduke’s luck appears to have run out, is &#x27;When the situation is hopeless, there’s nothing to worry about&#x27;).
== Sequel ==
* &quot;Hayduke Lives!&quot; continues the story from where &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot; left off.

==Adaptations==

A film adaptation of the book, written and directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, has long been in pre-production. Neil Young is set to score the film, and Open Road Films is its distributor in the United States. The film rights holders for the book filed suit against the producers of &quot;Night Moves&quot;, claiming that the film&#x27;s plot is significantly similar to that of the book.

<doc id="463025" wikidata="Q549944" url="?curid=463025" title="New World Order (professional wrestling)">
<text>The New World Order (commonly abbreviated as nWo) was an American professional wrestling group who originally consisted of &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash.

The stable originated in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) with the gimmick of a group of unsanctioned wrestlers aiming to &quot;take over&quot; and control WCW in the manner of a street gang. The group later appeared in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF; now WWE) after the purchase of WCW by the WWF. The nWo angle became one of the most influential storylines in the mid-to-late 1990s success of WCW and was instrumental in turning mainstream North American professional wrestling into a more mature, adult-oriented product. The stable became one of the main driving forces behind WCW competing with the WWF in the Monday Night War.

Fueled initially by the unexpected villainous turn of Hulk Hogan, the nWo storyline is generally considered one of the most successful angles in the history of modern-day professional wrestling, spawning several imitations and parodies, including the bWo, lWo and the jWo. The group dominated WCW programming throughout the late-1990s and continued until the dissolution of WCW in 2001, during which time there were several, sometimes rival, incarnations of the group.

In December 2019, it was announced that the nWo would be inducted into the 2020 WWE Hall of Fame, with Hogan, Hall, Nash, and Sean Waltman as the inducted members. Hall died on March 14, 2022 at the age of 63.

== Concept ==
The nWo storyline was an idea created by WCW Executive Vice President Eric Bischoff, whose inspiration for the angle came after attending New Japan Pro-Wrestling&#x27;s Battle Formation show at the Tokyo Dome on April 29, 1996. The show was headlined by a NJPW vs. UWFi match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, as New Japan&#x27;s Shinya Hashimoto defeated UWFi&#x27;s Nobuhiko Takada. Bischoff wanted to do an invasion-type angle where World Championship Wrestling (WCW) was being sabotaged by another wrestling group, initially insinuated as being the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), since the nWo&#x27;s founding members had previously wrestled for the company.

The nWo was originally portrayed as a separate entity from WCW. Often, propaganda-style vignettes and product commercials concerning the nWo were presented in the style of a broadcast signal intrusion, with a voice proclaiming, &quot;The following announcement has been paid for by the New World Order&quot;. Others, such as Kevin Nash, television director Craig Leathers, chief WCW booker Terry Taylor, and Taylor&#x27;s assistants Kevin Sullivan and Paul Orndorff, all contributed their own ideas to the nWo concept.

Leathers approached Disney/MGM Studios for a nWo logo. The designers came back with 6 to 10 examples, and eventually Turner management settled on the logo that would be recognized today. Scott Hall is credited with the group&#x27;s trademark hand-signals, and Taylor belatedly scrawled the group&#x27;s most popular catchphrase, &quot;When you&#x27;re nWo, you&#x27;re nWo 4 life,&quot; in one segment he scripted for &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; in late 1996.

Along with Bill Goldberg and Sting, the nWo was one of the main factors behind WCW during the Monday Night War and would later be parodied by the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s D-Generation X (DX) stable, though the core members of both on-screen factions included members of The Kliq; (Sean Waltman even served as a member of both groups; as did Shawn Michaels for a short time during the nWo&#x27;s revival in the WWF/E in 2002).

== History ==
=== World Championship Wrestling (1996–2000) ===
==== Formation ====

On May 19, 1996, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash wrestled their final matches as Razor Ramon and Diesel, respectively, in the WWF and signed with WCW shortly after. Hall appeared on the May 27, 1996 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, which emanated from the Macon Coliseum in Macon, Georgia. As The Mauler and Steve Doll wrestled, Hall emerged from the crowd and entered the ring, bringing the match to a halt, and called for the ring announcer&#x27;s microphone. &quot;You people, you know who I am&quot;, Hall said to the stunned crowd, &quot;but you don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;m here&quot;. He went on to deliver what became known as the &quot;You want a war?&quot; speech, stating that he and unnamed allies had a challenge for WCW executive vice president Bischoff and any WCW wrestlers. As the episode neared its end, Hall accosted Bischoff, who was also the lead broadcaster for &quot;Nitro&quot; at the time, in the broadcast booth and demanded that he tell WCW owner Ted Turner to pick three of his best wrestlers for &quot;a war&quot;. The next week, Hall claimed to have a &quot;big surprise&quot; for fellow professional wrestler Sting. On the following &quot;Nitro&quot;, the big surprise was revealed to be Nash. Hall and Nash were then dubbed as The Outsiders, randomly appearing at WCW events to cause trouble and inevitably be led out of the building by security.

Hall and Nash were both fully employed by WCW, but the storyline implied that they were contracted WWF wrestlers &quot;invading&quot; WCW. This was enough of a concern to the WWF that it considered legal action over Hall and Nash&#x27;s antics. Hall was the bigger concern to the WWF, as he had not fully distanced himself from his Razor Ramon character, continuing to use the character&#x27;s mannerisms and speaking with the character&#x27;s pseudo-Cuban American accent. WCW attempted to address these concerns at The Great American Bash in June 1996 after Bischoff promised them a match at the next pay-per-view event Bash at the Beach, he directly asked both Hall and Nash if they were employed by the WWF, to which they said no. The WWF, still unsatisfied, filed a lawsuit, claiming that Bischoff had proposed inter-promotional matches that would air on TBS and TNT, thereby associating the two promotions with each other. Also at The Great American Bash, both Hall and Nash pressed Bischoff to name his company&#x27;s three representatives for their impending match. Bischoff said that he had found three men who would answer their challenge, but would not name them. This would lead to Hall and Nash attacking Bischoff, culminating with Nash powerbombing Bischoff off the stage and through a table below. Bischoff held a draft on &quot;Nitro&quot; to determine WCW&#x27;s representatives, with Sting, Lex Luger, and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage being chosen.

==== Hostile Takeover Match ====

The match Bischoff promised, a six-man tag team match billed as the &quot;Hostile Takeover match&quot;, was scheduled as the main event of Bash at the Beach at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida on July 7, 1996. Hall and Nash came to the ring by themselves, leaving speculation open as to who the third man was. Team WCW then entered with all three members wearing Sting&#x27;s signature face paint as a sign of solidarity.

Luger was hurt and badly injured almost immediately after the match started and had to be taken away on a stretcher. The match reached its climax at approximately the sixteen-minute mark, shortly after a late tag from Sting to Savage. Savage went on the attack, nailing both the Outsiders with repeated axe-handle smashes from the top rope. However, while referee Randy Anderson checked on a downed Hall, Hall grabbed his shirt while Nash nailed Savage with a low blow which knocked both men to the mat. With all four men down, Anderson had no choice but to begin counting them out as he did not see the low blow. As he began his count, the fans&#x27; attention turned to the entrance area as Hulk Hogan entered and began walking to the ring to a loud roar from the crowd. Hall spotted him and immediately fled the ring. Hogan, who had not been seen on WCW television for some time, climbed into the ring to chase away Nash and tore off his T-shirt, as he had done many times before.

With the fans still cheering wildly, Hogan stood in the corner nearest and hit his long-time friend Savage with his Atomic Leg Drop, stunning the crowd and turning heel for the first time since his AWA days in 1981. The Outsiders came back into the ring to celebrate with their now-revealed partner as Hogan dropped the leg on the fallen Savage a second time, and after the three men all high-fived, Hogan threw the referee from the ring and hit Savage one last time, with Hall delivering the three count. The official match result was a no contest and Savage had to be carried from the ring by an exhausted Sting. 

After the match, the fans that had moments ago been cheering Hogan began to show their disgust toward their now-former hero and his new friends by beginning to throw cups, cans, and assorted trash into the ring. In the midst of the chaos, &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund came to the ring and interviewed Hogan. During the interview, Hogan exclaimed that he, Hall and Nash were &quot;the new world order of wrestling&quot;, giving the group its name – the New World Order. 

Hogan continued, reminding everybody of the &quot;great big organization up north&quot; where Hall and Nash had come from and that he too had been there and how he had made that company a household name. Hogan followed by bringing up his signing with WCW in 1994.

He then declared that Hall and Nash were the kind of people he really wanted as his friends and that together, the three of them were going to take over WCW and destroy everything in their path. At this point, Okerlund directed Hogan to look at the debris strewn around the ring and told him that he could expect more of this if he chose to associate with Hall and Nash (subtly suggesting that Hogan should reconsider one more time). Hogan disregarded Okerlund and went into a tirade against the fans while taking another shot at Bischoff and some of the newer talent the fans were cheering.

Hogan then grabbed Okerlund by the collar moments later but quickly let him go after Okerlund threatened to sue him if he didn&#x27;t. The show closed with the three wrestlers continuing to taunt the fans, who booed and pelted them with garbage. Wrapping up the event on pay-per-view, a still-stunned Tony Schiavone said: &quot;Hulk Hogan, you can go to hell... straight to hell&quot;. The night after Bash at the Beach, Hall and Nash appeared on &quot;Nitro&quot; without Hogan, attempting to attack Sting, Arn Anderson and Randy Savage, but were held back by WCW security. On the July 15, 1996 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hogan returned wearing all black and helped Hall and Nash attack Lex Luger and Big Bubba Rogers during the &quot;Nitro&quot; main event. He then made a challenge to then-reigning WCW World Heavyweight Champion, The Giant, for Hog Wild in August. On the July 29, 1996 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, The Outsiders attacked Arn Anderson, the American Males (Marcus Bagwell and Scotty Riggs) and Rey Misterio Jr., the latter of whom Nash threw head-first into the side of a WCW production truck before leaving in a limousine.

==== Hogan becomes World Champion; Bischoff&#x27;s secret is revealed ====

At Hog Wild, the newly rechristened &quot;Hollywood&quot; Hulk Hogan won the match after knocking The Giant out with his title belt. After the match, Hogan rechristened the Big Gold Belt as the self-proclaimed nWo World Heavyweight Championship by spray-painting the group acronym in capital letters across the faceplate. On August 26, Ted DiBiase made his WCW debut and would ultimately become the financial supporter and spokesperson of the nWo (thus becoming the fourth man), and was given the nickname &quot;Trillionaire Ted&quot;. On the September 2 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, the nWo claimed its first defection from WCW and their fifth member as The Giant, who just weeks earlier lost his title to Hogan, turned on his Dungeon of Doom teammates and attacked The Four Horsemen and Randy Savage.

As the Fall Brawl PPV event neared, WCW was gearing up for another battle against the nWo, this time in a WarGames match. On the September 9 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, the nWo tricked fans and wrestlers into thinking that Sting had joined the nWo by putting wrestler Jeff Farmer into the group as a Sting clone, complete with Sting attire and face paint. Farmer, as the nWo Sting, attacked Luger, who had been lured into an attack by referee Nick Patrick. This led Luger, his longtime ally and tag team partner, to publicly question Sting as to where his allegiance lay. At Fall Brawl, as Team WCW was being interviewed, Sting appeared and told his teammates that he had nothing to do with the attack, but Luger did not believe him. Going into the match, only three wrestlers on each side had been officially named: Hogan and The Outsiders for the nWo, and Luger, Arn Anderson, and Ric Flair for Team WCW. Sting had originally been named the fourth man for WCW, but his participation was in doubt. The fourth man for the nWo was indeed the nWo Sting, who had convinced everyone (including the broadcast team) that the real Sting was nWo. The real Sting showed up moments later as the last man for Team WCW and took apart the entire nWo by himself. After assaulting the nWo, Sting left the ring and Team WCW, yelling at an apologetic looking Luger &quot;Is that good enough for you right there? Is that truth enough?&quot;. Team WCW, now fighting a 4-on-3 handicap match, lost when the nWo Sting locked Luger in the &quot;Scorpion Death Lock&quot;.

The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, an angry Sting laid into his fellow wrestlers and co-workers as well as the fans for doubting his true colors. He came out unexpectedly, with no music or pyrotechnics, and kept his back to the camera purposely as he spoke: 


With that, Sting began a retreat from the ring that would last for nearly fifteen months, and in the process, left his loyalties on the table for either side to try and move him to theirs. The nWo stepped up its efforts to try and recruit Sting, yet never removed the nWo Sting from the group. As Sting&#x27;s character and look evolved, so too did Farmer&#x27;s nWo Sting character. On the same night Sting made his speech, the nWo inducted Syxx into the group, with the name being a reference to the fact that he was the sixth member (In reality, Syxx was the seventh member of the group, but Farmer&#x27;s entry into the group was not taken into account). On the September 23rd episode, the nWo debuted Vincent, as its &quot;head of security&quot;. Nick Patrick became the group&#x27;s official referee after he began showing partiality to nWo members during their matches. Miss Elizabeth turned against The Four Horsemen and joined the group as Hogan&#x27;s valet. nWo tried once more to recruit Sting, who was now sporting black-and-white face paint, to join them. After beating up Farmer&#x27;s nWo Sting and calling him a &quot;cheap imitation&quot;, Sting ambiguously told the nWo, &quot;The &quot;real&quot; Sting may or may not be in your price range,&quot; continuing to leave everyone questioning where Sting&#x27;s loyalty lay. Sting then told the nWo, &quot;The only thing for sure about Sting is nothing&#x27;s for sure&quot;, before leaving the ring. This would be the last time fans would hear Sting talk on WCW television for over a year.

The nWo continued to dominate WCW, with Hogan successfully retaining the World Championship against Randy Savage and Hall and Nash winning the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray) at Halloween Havoc. At Halloween Havoc, Hogan&#x27;s old rival Roddy Piper, whom WCW had just signed to a contract, came to the ring to confront Hogan. Piper began looking for a match with Hogan the following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;.

In the storyline, WCW only recognized Hogan, Nash, and Hall as WCW employees due to their holding WCW championships, and the other nWo members went unrecognized as WCW employees; because of this, they were unable to wrestle other WCW wrestlers. This led to the nWo starting a segment on &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, called &quot;nWo Saturday Night&quot;, where nWo stable members wrestled local jobbers inside an empty arena. The nWo also used their &quot;financing&quot; to purchase ad time during WCW programming, which amounted to low budget anti-WCW propaganda, or &quot;hijack&quot; the broadcast signal.

On November 18, 1996, &quot;Nitro&quot; was live at the Florence Civic Center in Florence, South Carolina and opened with Hall and Nash physically attacking The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags), High Voltage (Robbie Rage and Kenny Kaos), Ciclope, and Galaxy and forcing Tony Schiavone to walk off the show after they threatened him. As the show moved into its second hour, Hogan and his entourage accosted Bischoff at the announce table and forced him to say that Hogan was better than Piper, who was still seeking a match with Hogan, but whom Bischoff had not agreed on a contract with yet. At the end of the show, Piper and Bischoff began arguing in the ring. As Piper continued to badger Bischoff, the nWo rushed the ring and accosted Piper, revealing that Eric Bischoff, despite appearances, had secretly been a member and the head of the nWo all along.

At World War 3, Piper and Hogan signed an official contract for a match, though Piper would end up being attacked by Hogan and the nWo. In the main event, The Giant won the 60-man battle royal, last eliminating both Lex Luger and Kevin Nash, thus becoming the #1 contender and earning a future world title shot against Hogan.

The following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Bischoff permanently left the broadcast booth, and his character became an egomaniacal tyrant as WCW&#x27;s executive vice president, as well as a manager and largely replaced DiBiase as spokesperson for the nWo, while DiBiase continued to serve as a manager, mostly for Hogan. At the top of the program, Bischoff issued a threat to the WCW locker room: all wrestlers were given thirty days to convert their WCW contracts into nWo contracts and join the group. Marcus Bagwell (redubbed &quot;Buff Bagwell&quot;) immediately accepted the offer, betraying his tag team partner Scotty Riggs in the process. Mr. Wallstreet was offered a contract to join the group on December 9 by his former partner, Dibiase, and accepted. Japanese wrestler Masahiro Chono joined the group on December 16 and established himself as the leader of nWo Japan, a sister stable in NJPW. That same night, Big Bubba Rogers and Scott Norton defected to the group during a show-ending melee between the WCW and nWo rosters. 

At Starrcade, Piper cleanly defeated Hogan via a sleeper hold in the main event, in part due to botched interference from The Giant. At the same event, Lex Luger defeated The Giant, marking the nWo&#x27;s first pinfall loss since the group&#x27;s inception. During the course of the match, following months of showing favoritism toward the nWo, Nick Patrick officially joined the group when he attacked Luger. Additionally, after multiple attempts to convince Diamond Dallas Page to join the group, Hall and Nash attacked Page in his United States Heavyweight Championship tournament final match against Eddie Guerrero, costing him the match. (The nWo left with physical possession of the title belt, which was then given to Syxx, who began declaring himself as the champion.) The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, The Giant was assaulted and kicked out of the nWo when he refused to perform a chokeslam on Piper during an nWo attack and claimed that he wanted his World Championship match with Hogan.

==== Success and control ====
At nWo Souled Out, Hogan and The Giant fought for the WCW Championship to a no contest in the main event due to the nWo referee, Nick Patrick, being biased toward Hogan. The United States Heavyweight Champion Eddie Guerrero retained and subsequently regained possession of his belt against Syxx in a ladder match, while The Outsiders lost the tag team titles to The Steiner Brothers. Bischoff reversed the decision and re-awarded Hall and Nash the titles the next night on &quot;Nitro&quot; after claiming that Randy Anderson, who ran in to officiate after Patrick was knocked down, was not the official referee for the match. Bischoff then fired Anderson for his actions.

At SuperBrawl VII, the Outsiders lost their titles to Lex Luger and The Giant, while Syxx defeated Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship. Later that night, Hogan successfully defended his title against Roddy Piper. &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage, after weeks of roving with Sting as a &quot;free agent&quot;, helped Hogan win. Savage participated in a post-match beatdown of Piper, officially cementing his place in the nWo. The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Savage helped the Outsiders get revenge on DDP by attacking him from behind while they distracted him, and reunited with Miss Elizabeth. Later, Bischoff returned the tag team titles to The Outsiders, as Luger had been injured and was not cleared to wrestle in the SuperBrawl match. Luger, however, issued a challenge for a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; tag team match at Uncensored. Two weeks later on the March 3 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Turner Sports vice president Dr. Harvey Schiller &quot;suspended&quot; Bischoff for abuse of his office. At Uncensored, Team nWo won the 3-team tag team match. In addition to winning, per the pre-match stipulations, the nWo gained the right to challenge for any WCW championship whenever and wherever they pleased. After the match, Sting descended from the rafters and attacked the core members of the nWo: Savage, Hall, Nash and Hogan, finally cementing his allegiance to WCW.

It was around this time in April 1997 that tensions began to surface within the nWo. At Spring Stampede, the show ended with Savage and Bischoff at each other&#x27;s throats after the former&#x27;s loss to Diamond Dallas Page, and both were held back by other group members. J. J. Dillon, who was appointed as WCW commissioner during Bischoff&#x27;s suspension, later had Big Bubba Rogers and Mr. Wallstreet removed from the nWo due to a contractual technicality. Additionally, Ted DiBiase quit the group (between mid-May and August 4) after feeling remorse for some of the WCW wrestlers who were victims of nWo assaults. In the interim, the nWo recruited The Great Muta on May 26, as well as Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Hiro Saito several weeks after Spring Stampede; they made occasional appearances on television due to their full-time employment in NJPW, but all three would be core members of nWo Japan. The nWo also added Konnan, whom they dubbed &quot;K-Dawg&quot;, on July 14 after he attacked Rey Mysterio, Jr. while Kevin Nash watched on approvingly.

At Bash at the Beach in July, Dennis Rodman, who had previously become a member of the nWo earlier in the year, made his wrestling debut as he teamed with Hogan to take on Luger and The Giant in a tag team match. Luger won the match for his team by forcing Hogan to submit and earned a title shot at Road Wild, set for August. Luger, however, elected to take his shot on the August 4 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, five days before the pay-per-view, and defeated Hogan to win the WCW Championship. Hogan regained the title at Road Wild after Rodman, dressed as Sting, hit Luger with a baseball bat. Following Road Wild, the nWo began a rivalry with The Four Horsemen, marked by a skit where they mocked members of the group. The Horsemen responded by challenging the nWo to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September. The match pitted Ric Flair, Curt Hennig, Steve McMichael and Chris Benoit against Nash, Konnan, Syxx, and Bagwell. During the match, Curt Hennig turned on his team to align with the nWo. The nWo was victorious after McMichael surrendered in the match.

Bret Hart made his WCW debut on the December 15 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; and declared he would not join the nWo (the nWo had been claiming weeks beforehand that Bret had already joined the group), but did say he would be the special guest referee for a match between Eric Bischoff and Larry Zbyszko at Starrcade. If Bischoff won the match, the nWo would be given permanent control over &quot;Nitro&quot;, but if Zbyszko won, it would remain with WCW. Rick Rude (who previously had been in WCW during the early to mid &#x27;90s) also joined the nWo around this time, serving as a manager, predominantly for Curt Hennig. On the &quot;Nitro&quot; before Starrcade, the nWo completely took over the show by tearing down the set and chasing off the WCW announce team. They destroyed anything WCW-related and rebranded it &quot;nWo Monday Nitro&quot;. This event was done as a test run for what was planned to be a permanent changeover of &quot;Nitro&quot; to an nWo-centric show, with the soon-debuting &quot;Thunder&quot; to become the WCW-centric show. However, the ratings dropped dramatically during this show, putting these plans on ice. Zbyszko went on to defeat Bischoff at Starrcade, and &quot;Nitro&quot; remained in the control of WCW. Also at Starrcade, Hogan lost the WCW World Championship to Sting. Hogan originally pinned Sting, but confusion arose when Hart appeared at ringside and accused referee and former nWo member Nick Patrick of making a fast count. In reality, Nick Patrick was supposed to make a fast count, revealing himself to be a crooked official for the nWo. But for whatever reason, Patrick counted a legitimate three-count instead, leading many to speculate that backstage politics were at play. Bret Hart, who was acting as a referee for the event, ordered the match to restart as a result of the controversy. Hogan then submitted to Sting&#x27;s &quot;Scorpion Death Lock&quot;, and the entire WCW locker room came out to celebrate the defeat of Hogan.

==== Dissension; nWo Hollywood and nWo Wolfpac ====
Shortly after Hogan lost the title at Starrcade, the nWo started showing more and more signs of division within the group. Because of the controversy surrounding Sting&#x27;s title win, J. J. Dillon vacated the title on the inaugural episode of &quot;Thunder&quot; on January 8, 1998. In addition to the title being vacated, Scott Hall was still slated to face the world champion at SuperBrawl VIII as per the stipulation surrounding his World War 3 win, therefore this also would have to be resolved along with the vacant championship. New WCW commissioner Roddy Piper resolved the issue at Souled Out on January 24 by declaring that since there was no champion for Hall to face at SuperBrawl, he would face the winner of a second Hogan vs. Sting match at Uncensored the following March. Later that evening, the feud between Hall and Larry Zbyszko came to an end when Zbyszko defeated Hall by disqualification after Louie Spicolli, who had just signed with WCW and joined the nWo a month earlier, interfered. After the match Dusty Rhodes, who had been in the broadcast booth that night and who Zbyszko had asked to accompany him to the ring, joined Hall and Spicolli in attacking Zbyszko and joined the nWo, where he served as a manager and mentor to Hall.

The nWo continued to expand their ranks into the new year as former WWF star Brian Adams jumped ship to WCW and immediately joined the nWo. Hogan also gained a second bodyguard when Ed Leslie, who had previously tried to join the nWo at Hog Wild in 1996, re-debuted as a barely recognizable bearded biker dubbed &quot;The Disciple&quot;.
At SuperBrawl VIII, the nWo had a mixed array of success. Hall and Nash regained the WCW World Tag Team Championship from The Steiner Brothers after Scott Steiner unexpectedly turned on his brother Rick and manager Ted DiBiase. Scott then handed the championship belts to Hall and Nash after the match and celebrated with The Outsiders and Dusty Rhodes, marking his induction into the nWo. However, Hogan lost to Sting in a match for the vacated WCW World Heavyweight Championship due to interference from Randy Savage. After SuperBrawl, Savage then made his intentions clear and declared that he no longer needed the nWo&#x27;s help to win matches. Savage also claimed that Hogan had dropped the ball, and that he was going after Sting to try to bring the world championship back to the nWo. Hogan and Savage tried to one-up each other on episodes of &quot;Nitro&quot; and &quot;Thunder&quot; over the next few weeks, which led to a steel cage match at Uncensored in March which ended in a no contest. Also at the event, Hall lost his World War 3-earned WCW title match against Sting.

The rift between the different factions of the nWo grew even wider after Syxx, who had been out since October with a severe neck injury, was released from his contract and sent to rehab for his ongoing alcoholism. Shortly thereafter, Scott Hall was also removed from television due to his own bout with alcoholism; this led to a confrontation between Kevin Nash, Eric Bischoff, and Hogan on the March 26 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;.
The differences within the nWo were becoming more apparent as Savage and Nash were suddenly realizing that Hogan had been only looking out for himself the entire time, and the nWo was seen as secondary. Nash sided with Savage after Hogan had interfered in a number of Sting/Nash matches, not wanting to have to face Nash for what Hogan claimed was &quot;his title&quot;. Nash supported Savage in his quest to defeat Sting, but also agreed to team with Hogan against the returning Roddy Piper and The Giant in a Baseball Bat on a Pole match. At Spring Stampede, Hogan and Nash defeated Piper and The Giant. After the match, however, Hogan assaulted Nash. Nash later helped Savage defeat Sting by hitting a powerbomb on the champion, earning Savage the win, the title, and the ire of Hogan who came out following the match proclaiming that Savage had &quot;his title&quot;. Hogan and The Disciple then attacked Nash and Savage to close out the show.

The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hogan issued a challenge to the new champion for his title, and WCW commissioner Roddy Piper made the match a no disqualification match and declared that no run-ins would be permitted. Savage and Nash made their own speech a little later, where Nash said to Hogan &quot;have a nice life&quot; and implied that the nWo was not going to be together, at least in its current form, when the night was over.

Late in the match, while Hogan and Savage were fighting in a corner, The Disciple entered the ring and gave referee Nick Patrick a neckbreaker. While this was allowed, due to the match being no disqualification, it also meant that no one was able to stop Hogan and Disciple from doing whatever they wanted to Savage. The Disciple hit his finisher, &quot;The Apocalypse&quot;, on Savage while the belt was draped over his shoulder. Just after this, a furious Nash charged to the ring to aid the fallen Savage. As Nash entered the ring, Eric Bischoff came sprinting from the back and slid into the ring to intercept him. After tossing Bischoff aside, Nash nailed the &quot;Jackknife Powerbomb&quot; on Hogan. As the match was still going on, Nash pulled Savage on top of Hogan and went to revive Patrick as Bret Hart entered the ring. Hart picked up the title belt, struck Nash with it, rolled Hogan back over Savage, and revived the referee so he could count the pinfall for Hogan. Although Hogan was now WCW World Heavyweight Champion for a fourth time and appeared to have once again taken the reins of the nWo, the members of the group itself were now going to have to choose whose side of the faction they would be on: Hogan&#x27;s or Nash&#x27;s.
On the May 4 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Nash, Savage, and Konnan appeared wearing black shirts with a red nWo logo, as opposed to the familiar white logo. They called themselves nWo Wolfpac (a name which Nash had previously been using alongside Hall and Syxx to refer to themselves as a trio), and were joined in the following weeks by Curt Hennig, Miss Elizabeth, Rick Rude and Dusty Rhodes. The Wolfpac became the first nWo incarnation to wrestle as faces. Hogan&#x27;s side retained the black and white colors of the original nWo and took on the moniker nWo Hollywood, with Vincent, Bischoff, Scott Steiner, Scott Norton, Brian Adams, Buff Bagwell and The Disciple on his side.

At May&#x27;s Slamboree, Nash and Hall were set to defend the WCW World Tag Team Championship against two of WCW&#x27;s stalwarts, Sting and The Giant. However, The Giant joined nWo Hollywood shortly before Slamboree as retribution for Nash injuring him at Souled Out back in January. Despite this, The Giant maintained his alliance with Sting, but strongly suggested that Sting had a decision to make in terms of his allegiance. At Slamboree, Hall made his return to WCW in the colors of the Wolfpac for The Outsiders&#x27; title defense. During the match, however, he (along with Rhodes) turned on Nash by hitting him with the title belt, which gave the win to the team of Sting and The Giant. The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall was introduced as the newest member of nWo Hollywood.

On the May 25 episode of &quot;Nitro,&quot; the Wolfpac added Lex Luger, who subsequently urged his friend Sting to join him. However, nWo Hollywood made their own effort to woo Sting. Sting revealed his decision on the following week&#x27;s &quot;Nitro&quot;, fooling Hogan into believing that he was going to join his side, then turning on him and tearing off the black and white T-shirt he was wearing to reveal a red and black one underneath. As part of his joining the Wolfpac, Sting began painting his face red and black instead of the black and white &quot;Crow&quot; style face-paint he had been wearing since 1996. At The Great American Bash, the Wolfpac lost two members as Hennig and Rude turned on Konnan following a loss and joined nWo Hollywood. It was not a total loss for the red and black, however, as Sting defeated The Giant in a singles match for control of the vacated WCW World Tag Team Championship. The next night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Sting chose Nash as his tag team partner and the two began defending the titles.

In yet another shocking move, Miss Elizabeth defected from Savage (and the Wolfpac) and joined nWo Hollywood during a shocking promo (which included an on-screen kiss with Bischoff) on the June 8 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. On the June 15 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Savage had a steel cage match versus Diamond Dallas Page (which featured Piper as special guest referee, and saw all three men on the receiving end of an attack by nWo Hollywood at the end of match). This attack, which resulted in a &quot;knee injury&quot; caused by a chair to his knee, would be the storyline angle for writing Savage off of TV, and he would then take a hiatus from the company to recover from at least two major knee surgeries. This would be Savage&#x27;s final appearance with the Wolfpac, and with the nWo as a whole.

In the meantime, a new contender for Hogan&#x27;s championship emerged in the form of undefeated rookie and current United States Heavyweight Champion Goldberg, who had racked up an impressive string of victories. On the July 2, 1998 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot;, Goldberg was granted a title match against Hogan for the July 6 episode of &quot;Nitro.&quot; However, Hogan changed his mind and forced Goldberg to wrestle Scott Hall in order to earn his title match. Goldberg defeated Hall and then toppled Hogan in the main event to win his first WCW World Heavyweight Championship. After his loss to Goldberg, Hogan turned his attention to celebrity matches for the next two months, wrestling in two tag team matches at Bash at the Beach and Road Wild. Hogan won the first match with Dennis Rodman over Diamond Dallas Page and Karl Malone. The second match was a culmination of a storyline involving several &quot;Tonight Show&quot; skits involving Jay Leno making fun of Hogan, which resulted in Hogan and Eric Bischoff taking over the show and Diamond Dallas Page coming to save the day. Hogan and Bischoff lost to Page and Leno thanks to interference from Kevin Eubanks.
Meanwhile, the feud between Scott Hall and Kevin Nash continued while Nash continued to defend the tag team championship with Sting. On the July 20 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Hall and The Giant challenged the champions to a match for the tag team titles. Late in the match, Bret Hart, who had been feuding with Sting over the previous few weeks, came out in an attempt to attack Sting. Sting knocked Hart to the floor and climbed the turnbuckle to taunt him, but the momentary lapse in concentration enabled Hall to pin Sting to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship back to the black and white. nWo Hollywood added a new member to its ranks on the August 24 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; when Stevie Ray joined their stable after turning on his brother, Booker T. A few weeks later, they lost a member when The Disciple officially joined &quot;O.W.N. &quot;and The Warrior on the September 21 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; after being &quot;kidnapped&quot; by The Warrior in the previous weeks.

The feud between Hall and Nash culminated in a singles match at Halloween Havoc in October, where Hall earned a countout win when Nash left the ring after soundly assaulting Hall. Nash later stated that he didn&#x27;t care about winning the match, he just wanted his friend back. On the same night, Hogan defeated The Warrior when Hogan&#x27;s nephew, Horace, interfered and joined nWo Hollywood. Bret Hart defeated Wolfpac member Sting, injuring him and putting him out of action for around 6 months. This would be Sting&#x27;s final appearance with nWo Wolfpac.

At World War 3, nWo Hollywood attacked Scott Hall and kicked him out of the group for disrespecting Hogan and Bischoff a few weeks earlier. Later that night in the main event, Kevin Nash won the 60-man battle royal and earned a WCW World Heavyweight Championship shot against the still-undefeated Goldberg. On the Thanksgiving episode of &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, nWo Hollywood leader Hollywood Hogan announced his retirement from professional wrestling and Scott Steiner went on to assume the leadership role in the nWo Hollywood faction. On the November 30 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Dusty Rhodes was appointed, by Bischoff, to be &quot;special guest referee&quot; during the Barry Windham vs Dean Malenko match later that night, but during the match Rhodes turned on Windham &amp; Bischoff and quit the nWo for good (which resulted in him getting &quot;kayfabe&quot; fired by Bischoff). At Starrcade, Nash handed Goldberg his first loss and won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Disco Inferno interfered in the match and Scott Hall shocked Goldberg with a taser, incapacitating him long enough for an oblivious Nash to hit the &quot;Jackknife Powerbomb&quot; and score the win.

On the first &quot;Nitro&quot; after Starrcade (December 28 episode), the main event would be between WCW/nWo president Eric Bischoff and WCW&#x27;s franchise player Ric Flair. This was after months of feuding and weeks of demanding a match against Bischoff for the presidency of the company. Flair declared he would give up all his possessions if he lost. The match was made by Bischoff, who believed that Flair would not be able to compete after he had a kayfabe heart attack during a promo. Flair, despite interference by The Giant (which led to the shocking return of Savage, who assisted Flair and quit the nWo for good) defeated Bischoff in the match to become WCW president for 90 days, and Bischoff was relegated back to his old position as an on-air commentator. The ending of the match symbolized a new beginning for WCW heading into 1999 and appeared to be the possible conclusion to the nWo storyline.

==== nWo Elite and nWo B-Team ====

As 1999 began, the divided nWo factions were headed by world champion and &quot;de facto&quot; leader Nash, who was unhappy with Hall&#x27;s actions at Starrcade, and Scott Steiner, who had taken over nWo Hollywood following Hogan&#x27;s retirement in November. On the first &quot;Nitro&quot; of the new year, which took place at Atlanta&#x27;s Georgia Dome on January 4, Nash and Goldberg were scheduled to face off in a Starrcade rematch as Nash had promised on the December 28 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. However, nWo Hollywood accused the former champion of stalking Miss Elizabeth and Goldberg was arrested and taken from the arena in handcuffs. Later that night, Hogan made his return to WCW for the first time since November 1998 and was challenged by the reigning champion. Hogan accepted Nash&#x27;s request and took Goldberg&#x27;s place in the main event. In the match, after the bell rang to begin the bout, Hogan poked Nash in the chest, after which Nash fell to the mat. Hogan covered Nash for the win and became champion again. After the win, Hogan celebrated in the ring with Nash, Hall, and Steiner, revealing that the entire nWo split was all a ruse, and the group had reunited under what would become known as the nWo Elite label.

While Hogan, Hall, Nash, Steiner, Lex Luger, Konnan, Buff Bagwell, Disco Inferno, Eric Bischoff and Miss Elizabeth were part of the new &quot;nWo Elite&quot; and mostly wore the red and black colors of nWo Wolfpac, the undercard wrestlers in the nWo (The Giant, Curt Hennig, Horace Hogan, Stevie Ray, Brian Adams, Scott Norton, and Vincent) were still in the black and white colors of nWo Hollywood and were never officially assimilated back into the group. The &quot;nWo Elite&quot; quickly began to &quot;trim the fat&quot; by eliminating a few guys from the newly reunited nWo entirely (first, Konnan and The Giant were both [separately] kicked out on the January 11 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;; and then Hennig was kicked out on the January 25 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;). The subtractions of The Giant and Hennig from the nWo &quot;black and white&quot; left a short-lived group sardonically labeled the nWo B-Team by fans and commentators. This &quot;B-Team&quot; was a staple of WCW programming throughout 1999, and it officially consisted of Stevie Ray, Brian Adams, Vincent, Horace, and Scott Norton. Stevie Ray eventually became their leader after winning a 4-man &quot;Battle Royal&quot; match on the April 5 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; (Norton was not present for this match).

==== End of the nWo era ====
The reunited nWo did not last long for either faction. The nWo Wolfpac Elite enjoyed initial success with Hogan as WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Steiner as World Television Champion, and Hall as United States Heavyweight Champion. However, the group would quickly be wrecked by injuries when Hall&#x27;s foot was accidentally backed over by a car, putting him out of action (Hall was subsequently stripped of his title), while Luger suffered a torn biceps and, as a result, he and Miss Elizabeth went on hiatus. Hogan then dropped the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in a First Blood barbed wire steel cage match at Uncensored to Ric Flair, and Steiner lost the World Television Championship to Booker T after Buff Bagwell accidentally nailed him with a chair. Shortly after, Steiner assaulted Bagwell and threw him out of the group. Scott later reunited with his brother Rick, who interfered on Scott&#x27;s behalf during his match with Bagwell at Slamboree in May 1999.

A month earlier, Hogan suffered a severe injury during a fatal four-way match (with Page, Flair and a returning Sting, with a returning Randy Savage as the special guest referee) at Spring Stampede for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Diamond Dallas Page won, and was put out of action for three months. It has since been debated whether this injury was legitimate or not. Nash then began a rivalry with Page, who he blamed for causing Hogan&#x27;s injury, and defeated him for the WCW Championship at Slamboree. Scott Steiner was forced to go on hiatus due to a back injury and was subsequently stripped of the United States Heavyweight Championship. Other minor members included Disco Inferno, David Flair, and Samantha. Inferno engaged in a feud with Konnan that ended with a loss to him at Spring Stampede (which was the quiet end of his membership), while Flair and Samantha were quietly removed from television following Hogan&#x27;s title loss at Uncensored.

However, by that time, the nWo Elite had collapsed and no longer had any importance in WCW. As the year went on, the nWo Black and White (B-Team) members slowly began distancing themselves from each other. Stevie Ray left the group in July to reform Harlem Heat with his brother Booker T. Brian Adams was kicked out of the group on the August 16 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; and vanished from WCW programming for some time, eventually returning and forming a tag team with Bryan Clark called KroniK. Scott Norton left WCW completely after the September 30 episode of &quot;Thunder&quot; and returned to Japan. Vincent left the group and joined The West Texas Rednecks alongside former nWo stablemates Curt Hennig and Barry Windham, changing his name to &quot;Curly Bill&quot; and later to &quot;Shane&quot; (as another slap at Vince McMahon). Horace Hogan would quietly go on his own after all of this.

Hogan and Nash also entered a feud before the end of the summer. Nash lost the WCW Championship in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach in July pitting him and Sting against Sid Vicious and Randy Savage as Savage pinned him. The next night, Hogan returned to &quot;Nitro&quot; and accepted a challenge from Savage for the championship; Nash interfered by hitting a &quot;Jacknife Powerbomb&quot; on Savage and gave Hogan the victory, but the next week Nash attacked Hogan during a match with Vicious and aligned himself with Vicious and Rick Steiner. Over the next few weeks, Hogan and Nash, along with Vicious and Steiner (on Nash&#x27;s side) and Sting and a returning Goldberg (on Hogan&#x27;s side) feuded with each other, culminating in a match at Road Wild where Hogan put his title and career on the line against Nash&#x27;s career. Hogan returned to his red and yellow attire on &quot;Nitro&quot; shortly before, and subsequently dropped the &quot;Hollywood&quot; moniker from his name. Hogan won the match, thus forcing Nash to retire and ending the nWo Wolfpac elite completely. Nash did continue to make appearances afterward, usually stirring up trouble backstage with Hall as his cohort.

==== nWo 2000 ====
In late December 1999, Nash, Hall, Jeff Jarrett, and Bret Hart once again reformed the nWo, this time with the colors black and silver. Jeff Jarrett was often accompanied by the nWo girls (Midajah, Tylene Buck, April Hunter and Pamela Paulshock). Hall, Nash and Jarrett interfered on Hart&#x27;s behalf in his match with Goldberg, causing Hart to win the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. After Goldberg accidentally injured himself breaking the nWo&#x27;s limousine windshield, Sid Vicious, Chris Benoit and Terry Funk were left to feud with the nWo. 

Scott Steiner returned and rejoined the group after attacking Vicious. He later would be accompanied by the nWo girls. The Harris Brothers acted as the nWo&#x27;s bodyguards before joining the group themselves. As nWo members, The Harris brothers would become WCW Tag Team Champions twice. Hart was forced to vacate the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and went on hiatus from WCW in mid-January due to an injury suffered in a match with Goldberg at Starrcade 1999. 

At the following pay-per view Souled Out, Nash defeated Funk to become WCW commissioner, but his reign was cut short after he suffered a broken ankle and had to withdraw from WCW for a while. Jarrett won a title shot soon after, facing new WCW World Heavyweight Champion Sid Vicious at SuperBrawl 2000. However, Jarrett also feuded with fellow nWo member Scott Hall after Hall attempted to defeat Vicious and win the title himself. The match at Superbrawl was changed to a triple threat match between Hall, Jarrett and Vicious. Vicious won the match and Hall left WCW for good. Jarrett faced Vicious for the title again at Uncensored but lost. With the return of Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo in April, the nWo completely dismantled and Jarrett, Steiner and the Harris brothers joined The New Blood while the returning Nash joined The Millionaire&#x27;s Club.

=== World Wrestling Federation / WWE (2002) ===
====Feud with The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin====
After the WWF bought the WCW video library and trademarks in 2001, Vince McMahon brought in Hogan, Hall and Nash, the original nWo, at No Way Out in February 2002 as hired thugs in an attempt to &quot;kill&quot; the WWF so that McMahon would not have to share power with new WWF kayfabe co-owner Ric Flair. They began by targeting the company&#x27;s two biggest stars, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. This rivalry led up to Scott Hall going against Austin, and Hogan going against The Rock at WrestleMania X8 (matches which Hall and Hogan both lost). As a result of Hogan shaking hands with The Rock and getting a positive response from the crowd after his match at WrestleMania, he turned face and began feuding with Hall and Nash, with The Rock and Kane at his side on occasion, permanently leaving the nWo in the process. Hall and Nash then brought in former nWo member X-Pac on the March 21, 2002 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in Ottawa, Ontario.

On March 25, the nWo (now consisting of Nash, Hall, and X-Pac) was drafted by Ric Flair to the Raw brand despite rivaling against them. For the next two weeks, the nWo feuded with Kane until he was lured backstage by X-Pac and put out of action by having his head smashed against the floor with a chair. Following this, Nash was suspended for attacking Kane in storyline. In reality, Nash had injured his biceps and needed time off to recover. X-Pac would then begin wearing Kane&#x27;s mask, taunting him on the fact that he put him out of action. Bradshaw, who had come to Kane&#x27;s aid, fought Hall at Backlash, which Hall won with help from X-Pac. Big Show rejoined the nWo on the April 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when Flair teamed him up with Austin, whom Big Show chokeslammed.

====Attempts to rebuild and collapse====
The nWo was shortly joined by Flair when he attacked Austin with a chair and Hall was ejected out of the group and fired from Raw for &quot;repeatedly dropping the ball&quot; on Austin. In actuality, Hall had asked for his release for personal reasons. Lacking members, Ric Flair would recruit Booker T and continued his feud with Austin. Austin defeated Big Show and Flair in a Handicap match at Judgment Day.

With Booker T now in the group, his partner Goldust attempted and failed many times to get in, with the rest of the members (X-Pac and Big Show) becoming frustrated at Booker T. With Nash returning and attempting to rebuild the nWo, he brought Shawn Michaels into the faction on the June 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Michaels then literally &quot;kicked&quot; Booker T out of the nWo a week later. Michaels, then in the midst of a four-year retirement from professional wrestling, became the first nWo member who had never wrestled in WCW.

On July 8, Nash returned to action on &quot;Raw&quot;, teaming up with Eddie Guerrero, X-Pac, Big Show, and Chris Benoit to take on Booker T, Goldust, Bubba Ray Dudley, Spike Dudley, and Rob Van Dam. Seconds after tagging in for the first time, Nash tore his quadriceps after delivering a big boot onto Booker T, immediately putting him back on the injured list. On the following &quot;Raw&quot; on July 15, Vince McMahon came out to the ring to the entrance of the nWo music and made the announcement that the group was officially disbanded as Eric Bischoff became Raw General Manager later that night. Afterwards, the nWo storyline was stopped, and the remaining members drifted apart. Michaels returned to active competition within weeks, Big Show was eventually traded to the SmackDown! brand, and X-Pac was released from his contract.

==== WWE Sporadic appearances (2014-present) ====

The August 11, 2014 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which aired on Hulk Hogan&#x27;s 61st birthday, featured Scott Hall and Kevin Nash as guests. The two came out to the nWo music, dressed in nWo attire and shared a moment with Hogan, who revealed an nWo shirt hidden under his &quot;Hulk Rules&quot; shirt. They were interrupted by Brock Lesnar, who told Hogan, &quot;Party&#x27;s over, grandpa&quot;. Lesnar backed out of the ring after being confronted by John Cena, his opponent at SummerSlam.

On the January 19, 2015 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, X-Pac, Scott Hall, and Kevin Nash came out for a survey segment. They were interrupted by The Ascension, who were then beaten down by the nWo, The APA, and The New Age Outlaws. On March 29 at WrestleMania 31, Hogan, Nash, and Hall returned to assist their long-time rival Sting in his WrestleMania debut match against Triple H. The nWo helped to fight off D-Generation X (X-Pac, Billy Gunn and Road Dogg), who had interfered on behalf of Triple H. Shawn Michaels later joined Triple H&#x27;s side, turning the match in his favor, and Triple H would go on to win the match.

On April 7, 2019 at WrestleMania 35, Nash and Hall appeared as doctors during a backstage segment with Alexa Bliss, Michael Che, and Colin Jost. On July 22, 2019, during WWE Raw Reunion, Hall and Nash appeared as an aid to Seth Rollins and D-Generation X to confront The O.C. Hogan, Hall, Nash, and X-Pac then appeared at WrestleMania 37 (the night after the group&#x27;s induction into the WWE Hall of Fame) in a backstage segment with Bayley and Titus O&#x27;Neil.

=== Appearances outside WWE (2018–present) ===
The nWo appeared in a Heavy on Wrestling (HOW) show on August 18, 2018 during a match between X-Pac and Arik Cannon vs. Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz. Near the end of the match, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash inducted Cannon as a first new (albeit unofficial) member of the nWo in nearly a decade with Eric Bischoff appearing at the event. On October 19, 2018, the nWo (Buff Bagwell, Scott Norton and Syxx) competed against the No New Friends at the Glory Pro Wrestling #Unsanctioned event. The original nWo (Hall, Hogan and Nash) reunited in the 2Sweet nWo Reunion Tour in Orlando on October 27, 2018. In Uncasville, Connecticut, the nWo held its reunion show at the Mohegan Sun Arena on March 2, 2019.

== Legacy and impact ==
In 1997, the nWo had their own pay-per-view event called Souled Out. It was practice for WCW events to have co-brand naming (see WCW/nWo Starrcade) from January 24, 1998 to March 14, 1999. The WCW World Heavyweight Championship occasionally received this co-branding as well, particularly in ring introductions performed by Michael Buffer.

The nWo has inspired many parody factions like Stevie Richards&#x27; bWo and Eddie Guerrero&#x27;s Latino World Order. During his time in Juggalo Championship Wrestling (JCW), Hall, along with Corporal Robinson and the Insane Clown Posse formed the Juggalo World Order at JCW&#x27;s Evansville Invasion on October 6, 2007. To date, fellow nWo alumni Sean Waltman and Kevin Nash have joined this faction for occasional matches.

The group&#x27;s main logo has been parodied in various WWE merchandise for various wrestlers and groups, such as Randy Orton&#x27;s &quot;rKo&quot; shirt, &quot;WWE NXT&quot;″s &quot;nXt: next generation&quot; shirt, and Santos Escobar&#x27;s LdF shirt.

The nWo had major crossover appeal in its heyday. Football teams such as the New York Jets and the Jacksonville Jaguars were selling jWo (&quot;Jets World Order&quot; and &quot;Jaguar World Order&quot; respectively) shirts at NFL games in 1998. In that same year, Sin City Productions released a pornographic film called &quot;Nude World Order&quot;. The wrestling-themed Japanese manga &quot;Kinnikuman&quot; featured a stable called the dMp (standing for Demon Making Plant).

When Hulk Hogan joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in January 2010, Hall, Nash and Waltman (all of whom had been with the company previously) began to appear as The Band, a group whose name was a reference to the 2000 incarnation of the nWo&#x27;s &quot;the band is back together&quot; slogan. The group used a version of the Wolfpac theme as its entrance music. It disbanded within the year.

Current New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) stable Bullet Club takes some of its gestures and mannerisms from the nWo like the &quot;too sweet&quot; hand gesture as an homage, and have been considered the stable that most closely resembles the nWo since its inception.

The nWo logo has even made an appearance in college football. When Jacob Peeler was hired as receivers coach at the University of Mississippi (also known as Ole Miss) before the 2017 season, he sought an identity for his group and came up with &quot;Nasty Wide Outs&quot;, creating a wrestling-style championship belt with the original nWo logo affixed to it. Ever since, the Ole Miss nWo belt has been displayed on the sidelines by every receiver who has caught a touchdown pass and awarded after each game to a receiver seen by Peeler as deserving of the title belt.

On December 9, 2019, WWE announced that the nWo, consisting of Hogan, Hall, Nash, and Waltman, would be inductees into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2020. On the January 29, 2020 edition of Chris Jericho&#x27;s podcast &quot;Talk Is Jericho&quot;, Scott Hall stated that he felt Eric Bischoff should also be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a member of the nWo. Jericho agreed, noting Bischoff&#x27;s vital on-and-off screen role with the group, and suggested that he was not being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as an nWo member was due to ongoing &quot;residual heat&quot;. However, Bischoff was eventually inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2021.

On March 14, 2022, Scott Hall, the very first member of the nWo, died at the age of 63, Hall had struggled with alcohol abuse and chronicled his substance issues in an ESPN documentary in 2011, in which he said &quot;I should have been dead 100 times&quot;. Before his death, Hall had suffered three heart attacks after surgery complications, according to WWE IC Wrestling Champion Marc Mero.

<doc id="463026" wikidata="Q1193470" url="?curid=463026" title="Theme music">
<text>Theme music is a musical composition which is often written specifically for radio programming, television shows, video games, or films and is usually played during the title sequence, opening credits, closing credits, and in some instances at some point during the program. The purpose of a theme song is often similar to that of a leitmotif. 

The phrase theme song or signature tune may also be used to refer to a signature song that has become especially associated with a particular performer or dignitary, often used as they make an entrance.

==Purpose==
From the 1950s onwards, theme music, and especially theme songs also became a valuable source of additional revenue for Hollywood film studios, many of which launched their own recording arms. This period saw the beginning of more methodical cross-promotion of music and movies. One of the first big successes, which proved very influential, was the theme song for &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952).

==Types==
===Television===

Theme music has been a feature of the majority of television programs since the medium&#x27;s inception. Programs have used theme music in a large variety of styles, sometimes adapted from existing tunes, and with some composed specifically for the purpose. A few have been released commercially and become popular hits. 

Other themes, like the music for &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; have become iconic mostly due to the shows&#x27; respective longevities. Unlike others, these serials have not strayed from the original theme mix much, if at all, allowing them to be known by multiple generations of television viewers.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, iconic sports shows have such strong associations with their theme music that the sports themselves are synonymous with the theme tunes, such as association football (The &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;Grandstand&quot; and &quot;The Big Match&quot; theme tunes), cricket (&quot;Soul Limbo&quot; by Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s), motorsport (Roger Barsotti&#x27;s &quot;Motor Sport&quot; and the bassline from Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;The Chain&quot;), tennis (Keith Mansfield&#x27;s &quot;Light and Tuneful&quot;), snooker (&quot;Drag Racer&quot; by the Doug Wood Band), skiing (Sam Fonteyn&#x27;s &quot;Pop Looks Bach&quot;, the theme to &quot;Ski Sunday&quot;) and gaelic games (&quot;Jägerlatein&quot; by James Last). Themes in the United States that have become associated with a sport include Johnny Pearson&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Action&quot; (used for many years as an intro to &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;), &quot;Roundball Rock&quot; (composed by John Tesh) as the theme for the &quot;NBA on NBC&quot; during the 1990s and early 2000s, and for &quot;Fox College Hoops&quot; (from 2018–19 to present) and Jr. NBA Championships (2019–present), &quot;Bugler&#x27;s Dream&quot; (used in ABC and NBC&#x27;s coverage of the Olympic Games) and the theme to ESPN&#x27;s sports highlight show, &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. A notable theme that was once associated with a sport, but because of its popularity, spread network-wide was the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot; theme, which was used for &quot;Major League Baseball on Fox&quot; (2010–2019) and &quot;NASCAR on Fox&quot; (2011–2015) and &quot;Fox UFC&quot; (2012–2018) and &quot;Premier Boxing Champions&quot; (December 2018 to July/August 2019) and Jr. NBA Championships (unknown-2018) broadcasts, and was regarded as the network&#x27;s single theme by October 2010. CBS&#x27; longtime March Madness theme is considered one of the masterpieces of Americans sports theme music, said to deliver a euphoric feeling to many sports fans. In Canada, the soaring backbeats of the &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; theme, &quot;The Hockey Theme&quot;, became so iconic that the piece was sometimes called Canada&#x27;s second national anthem. It became something of a national scandal when broadcaster CBC Television lost the rights to use the theme in 2008.

Most television shows have specific, melodic theme music, even if just a few notes (such as the clip of music that fades in and out in the title sequence for &quot;Lost&quot;, or the pulsing sound of helicopter blades in the theme music for &quot;Airwolf&quot;). One exception is &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which features only the ticking hand of a TAG Heuer stopwatch. Another recent exception is &quot;Body of Proof&quot; which has no theme song, and barely even has a title sequence.

In most television series, the theme song is played during the opening sequence. One exception to this rule is &quot;Regular Show&quot;, the theme music of which is played only during its ending credits in most episodes. In lieu of its theme music, its opening sequence instead features a tone played on a synthesizer overlaid with a ticking sound effect.

===Remixes===
Notable is the theme for the game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, reimagined as Crystal Waters&#x27; &quot;Come On Down&quot; which marked the first time that lyrics were added to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; theme song and was the first song based on a television theme song (and the first to come from a game show) to reach number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart on the week of December 29, 2001.

===Radio===

Radio programs with notable theme music include &quot;Just a Minute&quot;, which uses a high-speed rendition of the &quot;Minute Waltz&quot; by Frédéric Chopin; &quot;The Archers&quot;, which has &quot;Barwick Green&quot;; &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; which has &quot;By the Sleepy Lagoon&quot;, and &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, which uses the instrumental from &quot;My City Was Gone.&quot;

In talk radio, a different theme song is often used to introduce each segment, and the music (usually popular music of some sort) will often relate to the topic being discussed. John Batchelor is noted for his use of highly dramatic orchestral scores leading in and out of each segment of his weekly show.

===Video games===
Many video games feature a theme song that is distinctive to the series. A popular one to date is the &quot;Prelude Theme&quot; from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, which is played on most, if not all, of the title screens of the original games, most notably &quot;Final Fantasy I&quot; to &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. The newer ones also feature the theme, albeit usually modernized, and played during the ending credits.

<text>The Fieseler F2 Tiger was a German single-seat aerobatic biplane which was flown to victory in the 1934 World Aerobatics Competition (WAC) by its designer/builder Gerhard Fieseler.

==Design and development==

Gerhard Fieseler started his own company in 1930 in the former Segelflugzeugbau company at Kassel, Germany. Fieseler was a World War I German fighter ace with almost 20 kills to his credit, and became a world class competition aerobatic pilot. To compete in International competitions Fieseler designed and built the Fieseler F2 Tiger single-seat biplane, powered by a Walter Pollux II air-cooled 9-cylinder radial.

The 1934 World Aerobatics Competition, held in Paris, was the first of its kind, and, despite the deaths of two pilots and a few crashes, the competition continued and Fieseler won, although he went over the time limit due to a loose harness, beating his nearest competitor, Michel Detroyat of France (who flew an M.S.225), by 23 points (645.2 to 622.9). Fieseler retired from the sport with his victory.

The F2 Tiger itself would form the basis for later aircraft, including the Fieseler F5. It was built by Fieseler&#x27;s own aircraft company, Fieseler Flugzeugbau (later, Gerhard Fieseler Werke). The F2 served as both an important forerunner of later German aircraft which would go on to fight for the Third Reich in WWII, and as a famous piece of inter-war aircraft design, as well as being the winning aircraft of the first WAC.

<doc id="463032" wikidata="Q16859863" url="?curid=463032" title="Innings">
<text>An innings is one of the divisions of a cricket match during which one team takes its turn to bat. Innings also means the period in which an individual player bats (acts as either striker or nonstriker). In cricket and rounders, &quot;innings&quot; is both singular and plural; this contrasts with baseball and softball in which the singular is &quot;inning&quot;.

== Origin ==
The earliest known record of the term concerns a match in August 1730 at Blackheath, Kent between a Kent side and London Cricket Club. The London-based &quot;St. James Evening Post&quot; reported: &quot;&#x27;Twas thought that the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being beat at one innings if time had permitted&quot;.

== Usage in cricket ==
An innings is one of the divisions of a match during which one team takes its turn to bat, and is said to be &quot;in to bat&quot;. Innings is the subject of Law 13 in the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;.

* In a first-class match, there are up to four innings, with each team due to bat twice (in practice, this is not always the case). In a limited overs match, there are only two innings, with each team batting once (though there can be extra, shortened innings in the case of a tie).
* An innings may end in a number of ways, such as when all but one batsman on the team is gotten out, or in limited overs cricket, when the limited number of overs for that innings have been bowled.

The term is also used with the meaning of &quot;score&quot; for both the team and each individual batsman. For example, it may be said that &quot;he played an innings of 101&quot;, meaning that the player scored 101 runs in his innings (while batting during one of the team&#x27;s innings). Similarly, it may be said that the team had a first innings (score) of 501.

<doc id="463039" wikidata="Q213058" url="?curid=463039" title="666 (number)">
<text>666 (six hundred [and] sixty-six) is the natural number following 665 and preceding 667.

In Christianity, 666 is referred to in most manuscripts of chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation of the New Testament as the &quot;number of the beast.&quot;

== In mathematics==
666 is the sum of the first thirty-six natural numbers, which makes it a triangular number:

:formula_1. 

Since 36 is also triangular, 666 is a doubly triangular number. Also, where 15 and 21 are triangular as well, whose squares ( and ) add to 666 and have a difference of . 

The number of integers which are relatively prime to 666 is also 216, formula_2; and for an angle measured in degrees, formula_3 (where here formula_4 is the golden ratio).

666 is also the sum of the squares of the first seven primes , while the number of twin primes less than is 666. 

A prime reciprocal magic square based on formula_5 in decimal has a magic constant of 666. The twelfth pair of twin primes is (149, 151), with 151 the thirty-sixth prime number.

666 is a Smith number and Harshad number in base ten. The 27th indexed unique prime in decimal features a &quot;666&quot; in the middle of its sequence of digits. 

The Roman numeral for 666, DCLXVI, has exactly one occurrence of all symbols whose value is less than 1000 in decreasing order (D = 500, C = 100, L = 50, X = 10, V = 5, I = 1).

== In Christian religion ==

=== Number of the beast ===
In the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; manuscripts of the New Testament, the Book of Revelation () cryptically asserts 666 to be &quot;the man&#x27;s number&quot; or &quot;the number of a man&quot; (depending on how the text is translated) associated with the Beast, an antagonistic creature that appears briefly about two-thirds into the apocalyptic vision. Some manuscripts of the original Koine Greek use the symbols χξϛ chi xi stigma (or χξϝ with a digamma), while other manuscripts spell out the number in words.

In modern popular culture, 666 has become one of the most widely recognized symbols for the Antichrist or, alternatively, the devil. Earnest references to the number occur both among apocalypticist Christian groups and in explicitly anti-Christian subcultures.
References in contemporary Western art or literature are, more likely than not, intentional references to &quot;the Beast&quot; symbolism. Such popular references are therefore too numerous to list.

It is common to see the symbolic role of the integer 666 transferred to the numerical digit sequence 6-6-6. Some people take the Satanic associations of 666 so seriously that they actively avoid things related to 666 or the digits 6-6-6. This is known as hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia.

The Number of the Beast is cited as 616 in some early biblical manuscripts, the earliest known instance being in Papyrus 115.

=== Other occurrences ===
* In the Bible, 666 is the number of of gold Solomon collected each year (see and ).
* In the Bible, 666 is the number of Adonikam&#x27;s descendants who return to Jerusalem and Judah from the Babylonian exile (see ).
* Using gematria, Neron Caesar transliterated from Greek into Hebrew short-form spelling, נרון קסר, produces the number 666. The Latin spelling of &quot;Nero Caesar&quot; transliterated into Ktiv haser Hebrew, נרו קסר, produces the number 616. Thus, in the Bible, 666 may have been a coded reference to Nero, who was the Roman emperor from 55 to 68 AD. However, historic protestants such as Andreas Helwig in 1612 proposed the application of the Isopsephy principle to the papal name Vicarius Filii Dei.

== In other fields ==

<text>In polymer chemistry, an addition polymer is a polymer that forms by simple linking of monomers &quot;without&quot; the co-generation of other products. Addition polymerization differs from condensation polymerization, which &quot;does&quot; co-generate a product, usually water. Addition polymers can be formed by chain polymerization, when the polymer is formed by the sequential addition of monomer units to an active site in a chain reaction, or by polyaddition, when the polymer is formed by addition reactions between species of all degrees of polymerization. Addition polymers are formed by the addition of some simple monomer units repeatedly. Generally polymers are unsaturated compounds like alkenes, alkalines etc. The addition polymerization mainly takes place in free radical mechanism. The free radical mechanism of addition polymerization completed by three steps i.e. Initiation of free radical, Chain propagation, Termination of chain.

== Polyolefins ==
Many common addition polymers are formed from unsaturated monomers (usually having a C=C double bond). The most prevalent addition polymers are polyolefins, i.e. polymers derived by the conversion of olefins (alkenes) to long-chain alkanes. The stoichiometry is simple:
:n RCH=CH2 → [RCH-CH2]n
This conversion can be induced by a variety of catalysts including free radicals, acids, carbanions and metal complexes.

Examples of such polyolefins are polyethenes, polypropylene, PVC, Teflon, Buna rubbers, polyacrylates, polystyrene, and PCTFE. 

===Copolymers===
When two or more types of monomers undergo addition polymerization, the resulting polymer is an addition copolymer. Saran wrap, formed from polymerization of vinyl chloride and vinylidene chloride, is an addition copolymer.

==Ring-opening polymerization==
Ring-opening polymerization is an additive process but tends to give condensation-like polymers but follows the stoichiometry of addition polymerization. For example, polyethylene glycol is formed by opening ethylene oxide rings:
:HOCH2CH2OH + n C2H4O → HO(CH2CH2O)n+1H

Nylon 6 (developed to thwart the patent on nylon 6,6) is produced by addition polymerization, but chemically resembles typical polyamides.

==Further contrasts with condensation polymers==
One universal distinction between polymerization types is development of molecular weight by the different modes of propagation. Addition polymers form high molecular weight chains rapidly, with much monomer remaining. Since addition polymerization has rapidly growing chains and free monomer as its reactants, and condensation polymerization occurs in step-wise fashion between monomers, dimers, and other smaller growing chains, the effect of a polymer molecule&#x27;s current size on a continuing reaction is profoundly different in these two cases. This has important effects on the distribution of molecular weights, or polydispersity, in the finished polymer.

== Biodegradation ==
Addition polymers are generally chemically inert, involving strong C-C bonds. For this reason they are non-biodegradable and difficult to recycle. In contrast, condensation polymers tend to be more readily bio-degradable because their backbones contain weaker bonds.

== History ==
The first useful addition polymer was made by accident in 1933 by ICI chemists Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett. They were carrying out a series of experiments that involved reacting organic compounds under high temperatures and high pressures. They set up an experiment to react ethene with benzaldehyde in the hope of producing a ketone. They left the reaction vessel overnight, and the next morning they found a small amount of a white waxy solid. It was shown later that this solid was polyethylene. 
The term &quot;addition polymerization&quot; is deprecated by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) which recommends the alternative term chain polymerization.

<text>USS &quot;Nassau&quot; (CVE-16) (originally AVG-16 then ACV-16) was laid down 27 November 1941 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Tacoma, Washington, as M.C. Hull No. 234; launched 4 April 1942; sponsored by Mrs. G. H. Hasselman, Tongue Point, Oregon; acquired by the Navy 1 May, towed to the Puget Sound Navy Yard, Bremerton, Washington, and converted to an escort carrier; and commissioned 20 August, Captain Austin K. Doyle in command.

&quot;Nassau&quot; was one of thirty-seven Tacoma-built C3 CVEs, of which twenty-six went to the Royal Navy. It was one of the ten s that served in the U.S. Navy.

==Service history==
On 10 October, &quot;Nassau&quot; arrived at the Naval Air Station, Alameda, California, loaded aircraft, and four days later steamed for Pearl Harbor, thence to Palmyra Island, arriving 30 October. For the next four months, she operated between Palmyra and Nouméa, New Caledonia and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides.

&quot;Nassau&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 14 February 1943, embarked personnel and aircraft, and sailed 21 February on a ferry mission to Espiritu Santo. She returned to Pearl Harbor in mid-March and then continued on to Alameda, California. In April, she moved to San Diego and conducted flight training operations, after which she rendezvoused with Task Group 51.1 and steamed for Cold Bay, Alaska with Composite Squadron 21 (VC-21) embarked.

&quot;Nassau&quot; got underway on a search mission 4 May and conducted flight operations with Task Force 51, providing air cover for the occupation of Attu Island from 11 May through 20 May. She returned to San Diego in late May, arrived at Alameda 8 June and onloaded 45 aircraft destined for Brisbane, Australia. She delivered the aircraft 2 July and returned to San Diego via Nouméa, New Caledonia.

In August, she trained off San Diego before ferrying planes to Samoa. Returning to San Diego from Samoa, 19 October, &quot;Nassau&quot; embarked Marine Fighter Squadron 225 (VMF-225) for passage to Pearl Harbor. Arriving 30 October, she conducted air operations off Pearl Harbor during the early days of November and on 7 November, she embarked Fighter Squadron 7 (VF-1) and steamed for the Gilbert Islands for operations with Task Force 52.

&quot;Nassau&quot;″s mission was to transport VF-1 to Tarawa and to send it ashore as soon as facilities were available. The invasion of Tarawa commenced 20 November but encountered bitter resistance. As a result, VF-1 was assigned combat air patrol and flew bombing and strafing runs from the carrier in support of the assault troops. The squadron flew a total of 106 missions and spent 237 hours of flying time in four days of operations without losing a single plane or pilot.

&quot;Nassau&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 December following flight operations. She then sailed to the Marshall Islands with Task Group 51.2 and launched strikes 29 January 1944 against Taroa Field on Maloelap Atoll. The next day, the Task Group centered its operations around Kwajalein, Wotje, and Maloelap Atolls, with &quot;Nassau&quot; conducting both anti-submarine and combat air patrols.

&quot;Nassau&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 3 March, disembarked VC-66, and took on aircraft, cargo, and passengers for ferry to the Marshall Islands. Throughout March, ferry missions were performed between Kwajalein, Majuro, and Pearl Harbor. After repairs and alterations at Mare Island Navy Yard, the carrier sailed with 51 aircraft for Finschhafen, New Guinea 5 May. The next four months she performed ferry missions from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, the Admiralties and the New Hebrides Islands.

Upon arrival at Seeadler Harbor 1 September, &quot;Nassau&quot; reported to Commander Task Group 30.8. Thus began her tour of duty with Admiral Halsey&#x27;s 3rd Fleet, which made unprecedented naval history in the following months. &quot;Nassau&quot;&#x27;s mission was to operate out of the Admiralties with other escort carriers to provide replacement aircraft and pilots for the attack carriers of Task Force 38. Steaming in company with the oiler groups, which refueled the ships of the Task Force at sea, &quot;Nassau&quot; made three cruises into the western Pacific. She returned to the Admiralties with disabled aircraft which were destined for shipment to Pearl Harbor or the United States for reconditioning.

The first of these replacement trips was in support of the strikes against Palau; the second in support of operations against the southern and central Philippines. Then Task Force 38 shifted to more northerly targets in the Philippines and Formosa. &quot;Nassau&quot; reached Manus on 20 October. After offloading old aircraft and taking on new ones, she departed on her last replacement trip. Steaming to Ulithi Atoll in the Caroline Islands, she joined up with Task Groups 38.1 and 38.3 on 28 October and transferred 70 aircraft and 43 pilots to the attack carriers.

Task Unit 12.6.1, composed of &quot;Nassau&quot;, and four other ships steamed for Pearl Harbor 5 November, arriving 16 November. Two days later, &quot;Nassau&quot; was dispatched to San Diego. Among her passengers were 382 survivors of , which was sunk in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, 24 October 1944. Another ferry mission to Pearl Harbor followed in mid-November, with three more runs to Guam in December, January 1945, and February. &quot;Nassau&quot; returned to Alameda, California, 23 March and through the remainder of the war, performed transport and ferry missions between Alameda, Pearl Harbor, Guam, Manus, Samar and Saipan.

&quot;Nassau&quot; departed Alameda 13 May 1946 for Tacoma, Washington. On 28 October, she decommissioned and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Designated for modification for aircraft transportation purposes, her classification was changed to CVHE-16, 12 June 1955. Shortly thereafter she transferred to the Bremerton Reserve Group, and was struck from the Navy Register, 1 March 1959. In June 1961, she was towed to Japan for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Nassau&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service.

<text>The Compromise of 1877, also known as the Wormley Agreement, the Bargain of 1877, or [[Corrupt bargain|the Corrupt Bargain]], was an unwritten political deal in the United States to settle the intense dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election, ending the filibuster of the certified results and the threat of political violence in exchange for an end to federal Reconstruction.

No written evidence of such a deal exists and its precise details are a matter of historical debate, but most historians agree that the federal government adopted a policy of leniency towards the South to ensure federal authority and Republican Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s election as president. The existence of an informal agreement to secure Hayes&#x27;s political authority, known as the Bargain of 1877, was long accepted as a part of American history. Its supposed terms were reviewed by historian C. Vann Woodward in his 1951 book &quot;Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction,&quot; which also coined the modern name in an effort to compare the political resolution of the election to the famous Missouri Compromise and Compromise of 1850.

Under the compromise, Democrats controlling the House of Representatives allowed the decision of the Electoral Commission to take effect, securing political legitimacy for Hayes&#x27;s legal authority as President. The subsequent withdrawal of the last federal troops from the Southern United States effectively ended the Reconstruction Era and forfeited the Republican claims to the state governments in South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. The outgoing president, Republican Ulysses S. Grant, removed the soldiers from Florida, and as president, Hayes removed the remaining troops from South Carolina and Louisiana. As soon as the troops left, many white Republicans also left, and the &quot;Redeemer&quot; Democrats, who already dominated other state governments in the South, took control. Some black Republicans felt betrayed as they lost their political legitimacy in the South that had been defended by the federal military, and by 1905 most black people were effectively disenfranchised in every Southern state.

Criticism from other historians have taken various forms, ranging from outright rejection of the Compromise theory to criticism of Woodward&#x27;s emphasis of certain influences or outcomes, but critics concede that the theory became almost universally accepted in the years after Woodward published &quot;Reunion and Reaction&quot;.

== Background ==

In the November 1876 United States presidential election, Samuel J. Tilden received 184 uncontested electoral votes and Rutherford B. Hayes received 165, with 185 votes necessary for a majority. Four states (Florida, Louisiana, Oregon, and South Carolina) returned disputed slates of presidential electors with a total of 20 electoral votes at stake. Any of the disputes being resolved in Tilden&#x27;s favor would secure him the presidency, while Hayes needed all 20 votes to be certified in his favor. To resolve these disputes in the absence of a clear constitutional directive, Congress passed the Electoral Commission Act, which established a 15-member commission of eight Republicans and seven Democrats to review the contested elections.

The Commission voted 8 to 7 along party lines to certify each disputed vote in favor of Hayes. Under the Act, the Commission&#x27;s findings were final unless rejected by both the Senate and House of Representatives. The Senate, controlled by Republicans, declined to do so, but Democratic Representatives in the House resorted to dilatory tactics by raising spurious objections to electors from Vermont and Wisconsin and filibustering the debate on those objections, which threatened to extend the controversy beyond the scheduled inauguration on March 5. However, Speaker of the House Samuel J. Randall refused to entertain the dilatory motions and eventually, the filibusterers gave up.

A few Democrats complained loudly that Tilden had been cheated. There was talk of forming armed units that would march on Washington, but President Grant tightened military security, and nobody marched on Washington. At 4:10 am on March 2, President pro tempore of the Senate Thomas W. Ferry announced that Hayes had been elected to the presidency by an electoral margin of 110–120. Hayes was peacefully inaugurated on March 5.
==Historiography==
Since Hayes&#x27;s inauguration, observers and historians have sought to explain how civil conflict over the election was avoided. A variety of theories have emerged, with the most thorough and widely accepted being introduced by C. Vann Woodward in 1951.

===Contemporary analysis===
Because of the paucity of documentary evidence or publicity, which Woodward attributes to the nature of the negotiations and agreement, the existence and nature of the Compromise have been hotly debated by historians.

Contemporary accounts of the 1877 crisis lack any discussion of the backroom negotiations. Neither Abram Hewitt&#x27;s papers nor a 1901 history written by select committee secretary Milton H. Northrup mentions any sort of deal to secure Hayes&#x27;s presidency, though Woodward argues that neither man would have been privy to such talks. In his 1913 &quot;inside history&quot; of the crisis, Henry Watterson recounts a White House dinner during the first Grover Cleveland administration, at which four unnamed insiders attempted to outdo each other in revealing the most salacious secret from the 1877 crisis, though Watterson himself concludes &quot;the whole truth... will never be known.&quot; Despite the lack of solid contemporary accounts, after the crisis the story of a &quot;Bargain of 1877&quot; had gradually come to plausibly explain how Southern Democrats, though convinced that Tilden was the lawful President, were persuaded to recognize Hayes&#x27;s authority.

=== Woodward&#x27;s Compromise theory ===
In 1951, C. Vann Woodward attempted to reconstruct a complete version of the &quot;Compromise of 1877&quot; (in reference to the Compromises of 1820, 1824, 1850, and failed Compromises of 1861) in &quot;Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction.&quot; Emerging business and industry interests of the New South found common ground with Republican businessmen, particularly with the railroads. They met secretly at Wormley&#x27;s Hotel in Washington to forge a compromise with aid to internal improvements: bridges, canals and railroads wanted by the South.

Under Woodward&#x27;s Compromise theory, Southern Democrats acknowledged Hayes as president by ending their filibuster of the election, on the understanding that Republicans would meet certain demands. Woodward identified five points of compromise by the federal government during the Hayes administration:
# The removal of all remaining U.S. military forces from the former Confederate states. At the time, U.S. troops remained only in Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, but the Compromise completed their withdrawal from the region;
# The appointment of at least one Southern Democrat to Hayes&#x27; cabinet. David M. Key of Tennessee was appointed as Postmaster General;
# The construction of another transcontinental railroad using the Texas and Pacific in the South, part of the &quot;Scott Plan&quot;, proposed by Thomas A. Scott of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who initiated negotiations resulting in the final compromise;
# Legislation to industrialize the South and restore its economy following the Civil War and Reconstruction; and
# The right to deal with black people without northern interference.

Whether by informal deal or simply reassurances already in line with Hayes&#x27;s announced plans, talks with Southern Democrats satisfied the worries of many. This prevented a congressional filibuster that had threatened to extend resolution of the election dispute beyond Inauguration Day 1877.

=== Criticism of Woodward&#x27;s theory ===
Some historians, such as Allan Peskin in &quot;Was There a Compromise of 1877?&quot; (1973), argue that both Hayes&#x27;s election and the assurances offered to Southern Democrats to prevent a filibuster were not a compromise at all. Though Peskin admits that Woodward&#x27;s interpretation had become almost universally accepted in the nearly quarter century since he had published it, he argues that three of Woodward&#x27;s five conditions for compromise were not met, and those which were met were not made for the purpose of securing Hayes&#x27;s legitimacy. Hayes had already announced prior to the election that he supported the restoration of &quot;home rule&quot;, including the withdrawal of federal troops and at the time, it was not unusual nor unexpected for a president, especially one so narrowly elected, to select a cabinet member favored by the other party.

The remainder of the concessions, Peskin contends, were never made:
# A southern transcontinental railroad was never built and federal legislation to industrialize the South was not passed. Peskin argues that no serious federal effort was made during the Hayes administration to fund such a railroad or provide other federal aid for improvements. An opposing interest group representing the Southern Pacific actually thwarted Scott&#x27;s proposed Texas and Pacific scheme, and ultimately ran its own line to New Orleans.
# The Republican Party did not abandon efforts to regulate race relations in the South until at least 1890, with the failure of the Lodge Bill.

Peskin also suggests that Northern Democrats, who gained little from Woodward&#x27;s proposed terms, were more significant in quashing the filibuster than those from the South. For instance, Speaker of the House Samuel J. Randall was from Pennsylvania and was more interested in ensuring that the Radical state government in Louisiana was abandoned than in any southern railroad. Peskin argues that Tilden would have been unable to challenge the election successfully, and thus the abandonment of the filibuster by Randall was pragmatic recognition of limited bargaining power, rather than a &quot;quid pro quo&quot;.

Michael Les Benedict accepts the existence of an informal agreement but notes that the agreement itself had no legal effect, in contrast to the earlier legislative compromises of 1820, 1824, 1850 and 1861. In formal legal terms, the election of 1876 was not decided by negotiation, but by the official vote of Congress to accept the recommendations of the Electoral Commission. The reliance on the threat of a filibuster against the wishes of the Democratic leadership indicates that there were already sufficient votes to accept the commission&#x27;s recommendations.

===International recontextualization===
Greg Downs, in &quot;The Mexicanization of American Politics: The United States&#x27; Transnational Path from Civil War to Stabilization&quot; (2012), emphasizes the broad opposition to instability and political violence in the post-Civil War United States in the context of the electoral dispute. Instead of a negotiated compromise between opposing factions, Downs frames the dispute in a transnational context of &quot;state fragility&quot; and &quot;state stabilization&quot; in a period when many Americans feared &quot;Mexicanization&quot; of politics, whereby force would be used to settle a presidential election, resulting in a chaotic spiral of violent reprisals which were associated with foreign intervention and foreign domination of the Mexican Republic.

Downs argues that &quot;too often the 1876 election becomes in the historiography a site of fraud that outrages and also reinforces the centrality of electoral democracy to the nation&#x27;s story instead of prompting deeper examination of the central role of violence in broadly defining what politics is.&quot; The prospect of delegitimization or dual presidencies during a period of relative fragility in an international context was feared to &quot;Mexicanize&quot; the United States. Downs credits this fear, combined with lobbying pressure along the same lines from prominent Tilden supporters such as Charles Francis Adams Sr. and Alexander Stephens, as an explanation for the ultimate abandonment of the Tilden cause.

== Aftermath ==
In any case, Reconstruction ended. The dominance of the Democratic Party in the South was cemented with the ascent of the &quot;Redeemer&quot; governments that displaced the Republican governments. After 1877, support for white supremacy generally caused whites to vote for Democrats and the region became known as the &quot;Solid South&quot;. Until the end of the 19th century, black Republicans continued to elect numerous candidates to local office, although Democrats controlled most state representative and statewide seats, except for a brief period, roughly between 1877 and 1900, during which some fusion governments and candidates – supported both by Republicans and by Populists or another third party – were occasionally elected to state-level offices, particularly in North Carolina prior to the Wilmington insurrection of 1898.

President Harry Truman, formerly a Democratic Senator from the upper-South, in 1948 made the first presidentially-proposed Civil Rights Act in America, which included anti-lynching, voter rights, and elimination of segregation. &quot;No political act since the Compromise of 1877,&quot; argued biographer Taylor Branch, &quot;so profoundly influenced race relations; in a sense it was a repeal of 1877.&quot;

<doc id="463061" wikidata="Q685727" url="?curid=463061" title="Grayscale">
<text>In digital photography, computer-generated imagery, and colorimetry, a greyscale (more common in Commonwealth English) or grayscale (more common in American English) image is one in which the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an &quot;amount&quot; of light; that is, it carries only intensity information. Grayscale images, are black-and-white or gray monochrome, and composed exclusively of shades of gray. The contrast ranges from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest.

Grayscale images are distinct from one-bit bi-tonal black-and-white images, which, in the context of computer imaging, are images with only two colors: black and white (also called &quot;bilevel&quot; or &quot;binary images&quot;). Grayscale images have many shades of gray in between.

Grayscale images can be the result of measuring the intensity of light at each pixel according to a particular weighted combination of frequencies (or wavelengths), and in such cases they are monochromatic proper when only a single frequency (in practice, a narrow band of frequencies) is captured. The frequencies can in principle be from anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, etc.).

A colorimetric (or more specifically photometric) grayscale image is an image that has a defined grayscale colorspace, which maps the stored numeric sample values to the achromatic channel of a standard colorspace, which itself is based on measured properties of human vision.

If the original color image has no defined colorspace, or if the grayscale image is not intended to have the same human-perceived achromatic intensity as the color image, then there is no unique mapping from such a color image to a grayscale image.

== Numerical representations ==
The intensity of a pixel is expressed within a given range between a minimum and a maximum, inclusive. This range is represented in an abstract way as a range from 0 (or 0%) (total absence, black) and 1 (or 100%) (total presence, white), with any fractional values in between. This notation is used in academic papers, but this does not define what &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; is in terms of colorimetry. Sometimes the scale is reversed, as in printing where the numeric intensity denotes how much ink is employed in halftoning, with 0% representing the paper white (no ink) and 100% being a solid black (full ink).

In computing, although the grayscale can be computed through rational numbers, image pixels are usually quantized to store them as unsigned integers, to reduce the required storage and computation. Some early grayscale monitors can only display up to sixteen different shades, which would be stored in binary form using 4 bits. But today grayscale images intended for visual display are commonly stored with 8 bits per sampled pixel. This pixel depth allows 256 different intensities (i.e., shades of gray) to be recorded, and also simplifies computation as each pixel sample can be accessed individually as one full byte. However, if these intensities were spaced equally in proportion to the amount of physical light they represent at that pixel (called a linear encoding or scale), the differences between adjacent dark shades could be quite noticeable as banding artifacts, while many of the lighter shades would be &quot;wasted&quot; by encoding a lot of perceptually-indistinguishable increments. Therefore, the shades are instead typically spread out evenly on a gamma-compressed nonlinear scale, which better approximates uniform perceptual increments for both dark and light shades, usually making these 256 shades enough to avoid noticeable increments.

Technical uses (e.g. in medical imaging or remote sensing applications) often require more levels, to make full use of the sensor accuracy (typically 10 or 12 bits per sample) and to reduce rounding errors in computations. Sixteen bits per sample (65,536 levels) is often a convenient choice for such uses, as computers manage 16-bit words efficiently. The TIFF and PNG (among other) image file formats support 16-bit grayscale natively, although browsers and many imaging programs tend to ignore the low order 8 bits of each pixel. Internally for computation and working storage, image processing software typically uses integer or floating-point numbers of size 16 or 32 bits.

== Converting color to grayscale ==

Conversion of an arbitrary color image to grayscale is not unique in general; different weighting of the color channels effectively represent the effect of shooting black-and-white film with different-colored photographic filters on the cameras.

=== Colorimetric (perceptual luminance-preserving) conversion to grayscale ===
A common strategy is to use the principles of photometry or, more broadly, colorimetry to calculate the grayscale values (in the target grayscale colorspace) so as to have the same luminance (technically relative luminance) as the original color image (according to its colorspace). In addition to the same (relative) luminance, this method also ensures that both images will have the same absolute luminance when displayed, as can be measured by instruments in its SI units of candelas per square meter, in any given area of the image, given equal whitepoints. Luminance itself is defined using a standard model of human vision, so preserving the luminance in the grayscale image also preserves other perceptual lightness measures, such as (as in the 1976 CIE &quot;L&quot;ab color space) which is determined by the linear luminance itself (as in the CIE 1931 &quot;XYZ&quot; color space) which we will refer to here as to avoid any ambiguity.

To convert a color from a colorspace based on a typical gamma-compressed (nonlinear) RGB color model to a grayscale representation of its luminance, the gamma compression function must first be removed via gamma expansion (linearization) to transform the image to a linear RGB colorspace, so that the appropriate weighted sum can be applied to the linear color components (formula_1) to calculate the linear luminance , which can then be gamma-compressed back again if the grayscale result is also to be encoded and stored in a typical nonlinear colorspace.

For the common sRGB color space, gamma expansion is defined as
formula_2

where represents any of the three gamma-compressed sRGB primaries (, , and , each in range [0,1]) and is the corresponding linear-intensity value (, , and , also in range [0,1]). Then, linear luminance is calculated as a weighted sum of the three linear-intensity values. The sRGB color space is defined in terms of the CIE 1931 linear luminance , which is given by

formula_3

These three particular coefficients represent the intensity (luminance) perception of typical trichromat humans to light of the precise Rec. 709 additive primary colors (chromaticities) that are used in the definition of sRGB. Human vision is most sensitive to green, so this has the greatest coefficient value (0.7152), and least sensitive to blue, so this has the smallest coefficient (0.0722). To encode grayscale intensity in linear RGB, each of the three color components can be set to equal the calculated linear luminance formula_4 (replacing formula_1 by the values formula_6 to get this linear grayscale), which then typically needs to be gamma compressed to get back to a conventional non-linear representation. For sRGB, each of its three primaries is then set to the same gamma-compressed given by the inverse of the gamma expansion above as

formula_7

Because the three sRGB components are then equal, indicating that it is actually a gray image (not color), it is only necessary to store these values once, and we call this the resulting grayscale image. This is how it will normally be stored in sRGB-compatible image formats that support a single-channel grayscale representation, such as JPEG or PNG. Web browsers and other software that recognizes sRGB images should produce the same rendering for such a grayscale image as it would for a &quot;color&quot; sRGB image having the same values in all three color channels.

=== Luma coding in video systems ===
For images in color spaces such as Y&#x27;UV and its relatives, which are used in standard color TV and video systems such as PAL, SECAM, and NTSC, a nonlinear luma component is calculated directly from gamma-compressed primary intensities as a weighted sum, which, although not a perfect representation of the colorimetric luminance, can be calculated more quickly without the gamma expansion and compression used in photometric/colorimetric calculations. In the Y&#x27;UV and Y&#x27;IQ models used by PAL and NTSC, the rec601 luma component is computed as
formula_8
where we use the prime to distinguish these nonlinear values from the sRGB nonlinear values (discussed above) which use a somewhat different gamma compression formula, and from the linear RGB components. The ITU-R BT.709 standard used for HDTV developed by the ATSC uses different color coefficients, computing the luma component as
formula_9
Although these are numerically the same coefficients used in sRGB above, the effect is different because here they are being applied directly to gamma-compressed values rather than to the linearized values. The ITU-R BT.2100 standard for HDR television uses yet different coefficients, computing the luma component as
formula_10

Normally these colorspaces are transformed back to nonlinear R&#x27;G&#x27;B&#x27; before rendering for viewing. To the extent that enough precision remains, they can then be rendered accurately.

But if the luma component Y&#x27; itself is instead used directly as a grayscale representation of the color image, luminance is not preserved: two colors can have the same luma but different CIE linear luminance (and thus different nonlinear as defined above) and therefore appear darker or lighter to a typical human than the original color. Similarly, two colors having the same luminance (and thus the same ) will in general have different luma by either of the luma definitions above.

== Grayscale as single channels of multichannel color images ==

Color images are often built of several stacked color channels, each of them representing value levels of the given channel. For example, RGB images are composed of three independent channels for red, green and blue primary color components; CMYK images have four channels for cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink plates, etc.

Here is an example of color channel splitting of a full RGB color image. The column at left shows the isolated color channels in natural colors, while at right there are their grayscale equivalences:

The reverse is also possible: to build a full-color image from their separate grayscale channels. By mangling channels, using offsets, rotating and other manipulations, artistic effects can be achieved instead of accurately reproducing the original image.

<text>The Chenango River is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in central New York in the United States. It drains a dissected plateau area in upstate New York at the northern end of the Susquehanna watershed.
Named after the Oneida word for bull thistle, in the 19th century the Chenango furnished a critical link in the canal system of the northeastern United States. The Chenango Canal, built from 1836–1837 between Utica and Binghamton, connected the Erie Canal in the north to the Susquehanna River. The canal was rendered obsolete by railroads and was abandoned in 1878.

Flooding is often a concern during the spring and fall.

==Course==

The Chenango River begins near Morrisville in Madison County, in central New York, in the Morrisville Swamp in the Town of Smithfield, about 25 miles southwest of Utica. The river flows from the Campbell Lakes in the swamp, from waters flowing in from the Smithfield Hills to the north and west and a series of cliffs called &quot;The Ledges&quot; to the north and east. It flows south-southeast through the swamp. From Morrisville, it flows south past Eaton and is paralleled by the remnants of the old Chenango Canal from Randallsville, just south of Hamilton, to just north of Earlville where the old canal joined the river. Continuing south the Chenango is joined by the Sangerfield River, also known as the East Branch of the Chenango, just south of Earlville. Then it flows south past Sherburne to Norwich, where it turns southwest. At Oxford it turns south, and at Warn Lake it again turns southwest. It flows past Brisben and Greene to Chenango Forks, where, about nine miles north of Binghamton, it receives from the right its major tributary, the Tioughnioga River. It ends where it joins the Susquehanna from the north in downtown Binghamton in Broome County. Its overall length is about 90 miles.

<text>West Okoboji Lake (sometimes known as West Lake Okoboji) is a natural body of water, approximately in area, in Dickinson County in northwestern Iowa in the United States. It is part of the chain of lakes known as the Iowa Great Lakes. The area was long inhabited by the Santee or Dakota Sioux. The Dakota-language name for the lake was &quot;Minnetonka&quot;, meaning &quot;great waters&quot;.

The cities of Arnolds Park, Okoboji, West Okoboji, and Wahpeton sit on its shore. Okoboji was derived from the Dakota name for the lake, and Wahpeton was the name of one of the major historic Sioux bands in the nineteenth century. Today the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux are a federally recognized tribe.

The lake has exceptional water quality and color, and is included on the DNR’s Outstanding Iowa Waters list. The lake has long been noted for its blue waters, with an author drawing comparison to &quot;Guarda(sic) or Lake of Zürich&quot; in the 1895 Midland Monthly Magazine. The statement that West Okoboji is &quot;one of only three blue water lakes in the world&quot; is a long-repeated myth, which has been refuted. The statement has appeared in numerous tour guides since the early 20th century. In an article in the National Geographic May 1981 edition from staff writer Harvey Arden, the Okoboji and Spirit lakes were called &quot;blue - water&quot; lakes.

== Geography ==
The lake&#x27;s maximum depth is , making it the deepest lake in Iowa and second in size only to Spirit Lake. The mean depth is . The drainage area of the lake is approximately .

==Recreation==
The depth of the lake makes it a popular regional destination for motor boating, water skiing, sailing, and swimming. The lake is also a popular fishing destination in the region. The main catches in the lake are yellow perch, bluegill, and walleye. It also contains significant populations of smallmouth bass, northern pike, muskie, crappie and white bass, black bass.

<text>USS &quot;St. George (CVE-17) (originally AVG-17 then ACV-17) was laid down on 31 July 1941 as a C3-S-A2 by [[Ingalls Shipbuilding]], Hull 296 of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]], under [[Maritime Commission]] contract as the (second) SS &quot;Mormacland&quot; for [[Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc.]], (MC Hull 163). She was renamed &quot;St. George&quot; (AVG-17) by the [[United States Navy]] on 7 January 1942; and assigned to the [[United Kingdom]] under [[Lend-Lease]] asHMS &quot;Pursuer on 24 February 1942. The vessel was launched on 18 July 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Mary Ann S. Bartman. The escort carrier was reclassified ACV-17 on 20 August 1942, acquired by the US Navy and simultaneously transferred to Britain on 14 June 1943. She was reclassified CVE-17 on 15 July 1943.

==Design and description==

There were eight s in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942 by the Ingalls Shipbuilding and Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards in the United States, both building four ships each.

The vessels had a complement of 646 officers and ratings and crew accommodation was different from the normal Royal Navy&#x27;s arrangements. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barber shop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three tier bunk beds, eighteen to a cabin which were hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

The ships dimensions were; an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . They had a displacement of at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 in single mounts, eight 40 mm anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts and twenty-one 20 mm anti-aircraft cannon in single or twin mounts. The ships had the capacity for up to eighteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Hawker Sea Hurricane, Vought F4U Corsair fighters and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

==Operational history==
&quot;Pursuer&quot; served in the Home Fleet during World War II, primarily on convoy escort duty. However, on 3 April 1944, she provided fighter support for an air strike on the German battleship in Altenfjord, Norway. On 26 April 1944 Grumman Wildcats of 882 Naval Air Squadron took part in the successful attack on a German convoy off Bodo, northern Norway. It consisted of four medium-sized supply ships and five escort craft. All four supply vessels and one of the escorts were hit with bombs and three of the supply ships were left on fire, the largest having run aground. While this attack was in progress other naval aircraft penetrated Bodo Harbour, where one large supply ship was hit by bombs and set on fire amidships. &quot;Pursuer&quot; suffered storm damage during this operation and repairs took a month to complete.

She served as an anti-submarine warfare vessel at the Battle of Normandy and in August and September 1944 she was part of a British carrier group providing air cover for the landings in southern France. The carrier was returned to United States custody on 12 February 1946, struck from the Navy Register on 28 March 1946, and sold for scrapping on 14 May that year to the Patapsco Steel Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

==Events==
In the opening of the year 1920, France was in a stronger position than she had been in for several generations. The Allied victory over Germany and the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine to France had placed France in the position which she occupied during the 17th and 18th century - that of the strongest power on the European continent. At the beginning of the year Raymond Poincaré was still president and Georges Clemenceau was still prime minister, but as both senatorial and presidential elections were due in January, important political changes occurred early in the year. At the general election for the Chamber of Deputies which took place in November 1919, there had been a strong tendency towards Conservatism, the Socialist Party being badly defeated. The elections for the Senate were held on 11 January, and these exhibited the same trend of opinion as had been shown in the previous autumn. Owing to the postponement of elections during the war, two-thirds of the nine-year senatorial seats had to be contested, and altogether 240 senators had to be elected. The elections proved to be an overwhelming victory for the various Liberal and Republican groups, who secured 218 seats. The parties of the Right won 20 seats, and the Socialists won 2.

While these important events were taking place in the internal politics of France, the final stages in the ratifying of the peace treaty with Germany were being passed through. The Treaty of Versailles was to come into force so soon as it had been ratified by Germany and by three of the principal Allied and Associated Powers; and since it had now been ratified by Germany and by France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Japan (though not by the United States), it was only necessary that the protocols certifying these facts should be signed by the parties to the treaty, and formal peace would then exist between the Allied Powers and Germany. The Supreme Council of the Allies decided that this final ceremony should take place in Paris on 10 January. Two delegates were sent by the German government to carry out the signing of the protocol, Baron Kurt von Lersner and Herr von Simson. The ceremony took place at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Quai d&#x27;Orsay shortly after four o&#x27;clock on the afternoon of 10 January. The protocol was signed by Clemenceau for France, by David Lloyd George for Britain, by Francesco Saverio Nitti for Italy, and by Keishiro Matsui for Japan; and, of course, by the two German delegates. The protocol was also signed by the representatives of various minor Allied and Associated countries, which had already ratified the treaty, these being Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, Panama, Peru, Poland, Siam, and Uruguay. The formal end of the war was timed at 6:15 p.m. on 10 January, but the actual signing of the protocol took place, as already stated, somewhat earlier on that same afternoon.

On 14 January, Léon Bourgeois was elected president of the Senate. And the election of the new president of France, by a joint session of the two houses of the legislature, was fixed for 17 January. The two most important candidates were Paul Deschanel and Clemenceau. Among the other candidates was Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch, who, however, secured very little support. The rivalry between Deschanel and Clemenceau revealed certain very interesting tendencies in French politics. The contest turned mainly on the terms of peace which had been imposed upon Germany. Clemenceau&#x27;s supporters contended that the terms of the Treaty of Versailles were satisfactory from the French point of view; his opponents declared that he had given way too much to the American and British standpoints, and that the peace was unsatisfactory, particularly in respect of the guarantees for the reparations due to France and in the matter of the French eastern frontier. A large body of French opinion had desired that France should secure the line of the Rhine as her eastern frontier. Deschanel represented these critics of the Treaty of Versailles. A preliminary ballot of the Republican groups gave 408 votes to Deschanel, and 389 votes to Clemenceau; and when this result was announced Clemenceau withdrew his candidature, but his name figured, nevertheless, in the formal voting of the National Assembly on 17 January. Altogether 888 legislators cast their votes, and Deschanel secured no fewer than 734 votes. The success of Deschanel was regarded in France as in some sense a victory for the opponents of the Treaty of Versailles. Deschanel was born in 1856, and had held the office of president of the Chamber of Deputies. Poincaré was to remain in office as president until 18 February.

On 18 January, Clemenceau resigned from office as premier; and Poincaré entrusted Alexandre Millerand with the task of forming a cabinet. Millerand found no difficulty in obtaining the necessary support, and the full list of the members of his cabinet was published two days later. F. Marsal was minister of finance, A. Lefevre was minister of war, and A. Sarraut was minister for the colonies. Millerand, who himself took the portfolio of foreign affairs, was sixty years of age, and had greatly distinguished himself as minister for war during the critical days of 1914. His first reception by the Chamber of Deputies was somewhat stormy, and a vote of confidence on 22 January was only passed by 281 votes to 240. But a second vote of confidence on 30 January was passed by 510 votes to 70.

On 5 February and 6 February, there was an important debate on foreign policy in the Chamber of Deputies; and a long speech was delivered by the prime minister. He said that the new cabinet had every intention of continuing the same foreign policy which had enabled France to surround herself with such faithful allies during the war. In reference to the Adriatic problem, Millerand said that the only desire of France was to reach a satisfactory solution of the difficulties existing in this part of the world - a solution in perfect agreement with the sister nation of Italy and with the Serbian people. In regard to the Bulgarian question the premier said that on the previous day he had received news that the Bulgarian parliament had ratified the treaty. Passing on to a consideration of the proposed peace terms for Turkey, Millerand answered certain criticisms which had been made earlier in the debate by Marcel Cachin. France, he declared, had important and historic interests in the East, and these she had no intention of abandoning. &quot;M. Cachin declared yesterday that we appeared to be threatening the independence of the Syrian populations. No French government has ever entertained such a design, and it is a libel on France to reproach her with a policy of conquest which has never entered her mind. The only wish of France is to give these populations justice and a good administration. When yesterday I heard the government credited with intentions which it has not, I seemed to hear an echo of the slanders levelled by the German government at the work of France in Morocco.&quot;

Turning to the question of relations with Russia, Millerand said that contrary to the allegations of Cachin, Britain had been true to her agreements, and none of the Allies had entered into any agreement with the Soviet government. In regard to Poland, the French government intended to maintain the closest friendship with that country, and if she were attacked by the Bolsheviks she would receive every support. Finally, the prime minister dealt with the carrying out of the Treaty of Versailles. He said that the cabinet intended to maintain complete accord with France&#x27;s allies; and although it was regrettable that the United States had not so far ratified the treaty, yet the Reparations Commission had begun its work smoothly, and he felt no anxiety as to the ultimate adhesion of America to the treaty. He said that Germany had been dilatory in the matter of fulfilling the stipulations of the treaty, particularly in regard to the essential deliveries of coal. &quot;I mean to avail myself at the right moment of all the means placed at my disposal by the treaty, and I declare, without making any kind of threat, but merely in order that the position may be quite clear and well understood, that we do not intend to claim anything from Germany to which she is not strictly bound under the terms of the treaty, but we shall exact everything she owes us, and to obtain it we shall have recourse to the measures of all kinds provided for in the treaty.&quot;

After the conclusion of the debate the house passed a vote of confidence in the government by 513 votes to 68.

After his assumption of office on 18 February, Deschanel sent the usual presidential message to parliament. Deschanel said that there was no higher destiny than that of serving France, and he thanked the legislators for having permitted him to continue to serve her in union with themselves. He hoped to maintain the national unity which had been so conspicuous during the war. &quot;Our first duty is to define clearly our diplomatic, military, economic, and financial policy to the country. We can only build up our policy for the future on sound bases. I appeal to all the experience and talent of the members of this assembly on behalf of this act of sincerity and moral probity. To strengthen the unity between all peoples who fought for the right, and who, by reason of that fact, are great, to strengthen the bonds with those peoples whose affinities or interests bind them to us - this is the first guarantee of peace and the basis of that League of Nations to which the Treaty of Versailles entrusted the execution of certain capital clauses, and which we should support by means of effective action in order to spare the world fresh horrors. France wishes that the treaty to which Germany appended her signature shall be obeyed, and that the aggressor shall not take from her the fruits of her heroic sacrifices. She means to live in security. Today, as yesterday, our policy is an affair of will-power, energy, and faith. The Russian people fought by our side during three years for the cause of Liberty; may it, master of itself, soon resume in the plenitude of its genius the course of its civilizing mission. The Eastern question causes periodical wars. The fate of the Ottoman Empire has not yet been settled. Our secular interests, rights, and traditions ought to be safeguarded there too.&quot;

Turning to questions of internal politics, Deschanel said that the work of restoring France to prosperity would be arduous, and he declared that the person who evaded the payment of taxes was acting like a soldier who deserts his post on the field of battle. It was essential that conflicts between capital and labour should be avoided. In his peroration Deschanel exhorted the legislators to follow in the footsteps of the heroic Frenchmen who had won the war: &quot;We shall accomplish our formidable task if we keep in our souls that sacred flame which rendered France the Republic Invincible, and saved the world.&quot;

In the middle of February the trial of Joseph Caillaux, the ex-prime minister of France, who had been under arrest for treason since January 1918, commenced. The case was regarded as the most important of the treason trials, of which there had been a long series since the middle of the war. Caillaux was tried before the Senate, sitting as a High Court of Justice, with Léon Bourgeois as president of the court. The prolonged delay in bringing Caillaux to trial was because investigations had to be made in many different parts of the world, including South America. Caillaux was charged with &quot;having sought to weaken the security of the state abroad by intrigues, machination, and intelligence with the enemy of a nature likely to favour enemy action in regard to France, or her Allies, fighting against common enemies, and thus to advance the progress of the enemy armies.&quot; M. Lescouvé (the public prosecutor), M. Moinet, and others appeared for the prosecution. M. Giafferi, M. Moutet, and others appeared for the defense. The trial was extremely long and also in many respects extremely dramatic. The trial began, on 17 February, with a series of interrogations by the president of the court, and this part of the scene alone lasted for several days. Next there came a cross-examination of the prisoner by the public prosecutor. Many of Caillaux&#x27;s activities were investigated in great detail and at great length. He was questioned regarding his relations with an enemy agent named Minotto, in South America, regarding his relations with another enemy agent, a certain Count Lipscher, and also in regard to his associations with the traitors Lenoir, Bolo, and Duval, who had already been executed for treason. The prisoner had also to account for his close association with various schemers in Italy, including the notorious Cavallini. During these interrogations, Caillaux frequently made long speeches on all manner of political questions. In the matter of Count Lipscher little to his discredit appears to have transpired; but apart from the details of the investigation it was obvious that if the prisoner had been entirely innocent of the charges brought against him, he had had a surprising amount of association with undesirable persons. And it was also established that the German government regarded Caillaux as the right man to approach under circumstances favourable to Germany. Moutet, speaking for the defense, attributed political motives to the accusers, and said that notwithstanding the fact that the world had been ransacked for evidence for many months, the evidence produced was of a ridiculous and trumpery character. After many weeks of investigation the capital charge of treason was dismissed, and the prosecution did not ask for the death sentence; but Caillaux was found guilty on the minor count of correspondence with the enemy, and was sentenced to three years&#x27; imprisonment, ten years&#x27; interdiction of rights of voting and eligibility for any public function, and five years&#x27; prohibition from appearing in certain places indicated by the government. It was found that his relations with Bolo and Almereyda did not fall within the penal code, but he was condemned for his friendship with Minotto, Cavallini, and to some extent for his association with Count Lipscher. Having already served more than two years&#x27; imprisonment, Caillaux was set at liberty at the end of the trial. The verdict was given on 23 April.

During the spring there were serious labour troubles in France. At the end of February a serious dispute arose on the Paris, Lyon, and Mediterranean Railway system, owing to disciplinary measures which had been taken against one man. A strike was declared on that line on 25 February, and subsequently spread to the state lines also. The government immediately called to the colours those employees who were in the Army Reserve. A general strike of railwaymen was declared on 29 February; but the response was only partial, and an agreement was reached within twenty-four hours. At the beginning of May another railway strike broke out, and on this occasion the labour agitators hoped to make the strike universal, and it was supported by the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), who called out the seamen, dockers, and miners in support of the railwaymen. The aims of the General Confederation were not only economic, but also partly political; and they announced that they aimed at the international allotment of war burdens, an economic &quot;entente&quot; of all peoples on a basis of cooperation, at the cessation of all colonial expeditions, and at general disarmament. The response to the call on the part of the workers was, however, half-hearted and partial, though in certain localities, including Marseille, the strike was almost universal. The strike was extremely unpopular in the country at large, and the government took legal proceedings against the revolutionary ring-leaders. Within a week it was clear that the strike would fail, owing to the apathy or actual hostility of a large part of the working classes, but it was not until 21 May that the leaders of the General Confederation declared the strike at an end.

In February the government issued a new 5% state loan, which became known as the &quot;Recovery Loan&quot;. The subscription lists remained open for several weeks, and it was announced in April that the total amount subscribed was 15,700,000,000 francs.

During the spring and summer certain differences of opinion, important but not fundamental, arose between the French and British governments. In a debate in the Chamber of Deputies on 25 March, Louis Barthou, who had once been prime minister and was now chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the lower house, delivered a speech on foreign policy generally in which he took occasion to attack the policy of the British government. He complained that Britain had profited more than any other country by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles; and that the course of events had recently been such that the hatred of Germany was now directed almost exclusively against France. This was, he said, particularly the case in the matter of permitting Germany to deal with her own war criminals, for which concession Britain had gained all the credit in German eyes. The speaker made various other complaints against the British government in general and Lloyd George in particular; but it was clear before the end of his speech that he did not carry the Chamber with him. On the following day, Millerand made a reply in which he endeavoured to remove the bad impression created by Barthou&#x27;s speech. The prime minister said that there was no &quot;crisis in the alliance&quot;; and he pointed out that the reason the concession to Germany in the matter of the war criminals was signed by the British prime minister was that at the time the note was sent the peace conference was sitting in London. The premier said, however, that France was determined to see the terms of the Treaty of Versailles fulfilled, and although the British government were in favour of allowing the German government to send troops into the Ruhr District, to suppress the Spartacist insurrection there, France viewed these movements of troops with grave concern.

The differences between the French and British governments were also apparent at the beginning of April, when the German government was suppressing the Spartacist revolt. To the east of the Allied armies in the occupied portion of Germany there was a neutral zone, into which, by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the German government were not allowed to send troops. During the Spartacist insurrection which followed the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Berlin (see 1920 in Germany), the revolutionaries in the valley of the Ruhr, a highly industrialized district which was included in the neutral zone, took advantage of the unavoidable absence of the government forces to seize control of the entire administration of this important part of Germany. The German government applied for permission to send forces into this part of the neutral zone in the exceptional circumstances which had arisen, as without doing so it was impossible for them to overcome the revolt in the neutral zone itself, or to prevent the successful insurrection in that zone lending important support to the Spartacists farther east. The British, Italian, and American governments were all in favour of allowing the German government, which in the circumstances existing was a bulwark against the spread of Bolshevism, to send a limited number of troops into the neutral zone until law and order had been reestablished there. The French government, however, interposed obstacles to the granting of any such license to the German government. The revolt continued to spread, and at the beginning of April German troops marched into the Ruhr Valley to restore order, although no permission for them to do so had been granted by the Allies as a whole. Thereupon the French government, without the consent of the British and Italian governments, ordered their own troops to march forward into the neutral zone - though not into the same part of the neutral zone - and to occupy various German towns as a penalty for the German advance. Frankfurt, Darmstadt, and Hanau were occupied on 6 April, and Homburg was entered on the following day. Black troops took part in the advance, a point which gave special umbrage to the Germans. This independent action on the part of the French government led to an interchange of somewhat sharp notes between London and Paris, the British government taking exception both to the French advance in itself and still more so to the fact that the advance had been made without due consultation with the other Allied governments. Within a few days, however, an agreement between the French and British governments was reached. The black troops were immediately withdrawn, and the French government made it clear that in the future they would not act without securing the consent of the other Allies. The British government on their side made it clear that they intended to see the terms of the Treaty of Versailles respected by the German government. After the suppression of the Ruhr revolt, both the German and French troops were withdrawn.

During the spring and summer there were various conferences between the French, British, and other Allied governments, at San Remo, Hythe, Spa, and elsewhere, these conferences relating largely to the reparations due from Germany under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. At these discussions similar differences of opinion appear to have existed between the British and French representatives, the British being more disposed than the French to recognize the difficulties with which the German government were confronted. But these differences of opinion only related to questions of method, and were in no way fundamental. In the middle of May Poincaré, the ex-president of France, resigned his position as president of the Reparations Commission, on account of what he regarded as the undue leniency which had been shown towards Germany. Millerand stated publicly, however, that he thought Poincaré&#x27;s fears were groundless.

In May President Paul Deschanel became mentally incapacitated; he resigned his office in September. It was soon evident that the great majority of public men desired that Millerand should himself become president. The premier at first declined to accede to these demands, but after some delay he consented to do so. The election took place on 23 September, and out of 892 votes cast, no fewer than 695 were given Millerand. A Socialist candidate, Gustave Delory, obtained 69 votes. Millerand announced that he hoped somewhat to increase the powers of the presidential office, particularly in regard to foreign policy. Georges Leygues became prime minister and minister for foreign affairs; but otherwise the composition of the cabinet remained unchanged. On 25 September the Chamber of Deputies passed a vote of confidence in the new government by 515 votes to 71. It was notable that in the statements issued both by the new president and by the new government, it was proclaimed that France would do her utmost to make the League of Nations a success. At the end of November Leygues visited London to confer with British and Italian statesmen on the Greek crisis and other matters.

In the middle of November it was announced that the government proposed to reduce the period of military service from two years to eighteen months.

In November Lord Derby, the British ambassador in Paris, retired from that office, and was succeeded by Lord Hardinge. It was also announced that Paul Cambon, the veteran French ambassador in London, would retire in January 1921.

Throughout the year there was considerable, though intermittent, discussion on the proposal that France should resume diplomatic relations with the Vatican; and at the end of November the government proposal to renew relations was approved by the Chamber of Deputies by 387 votes to 210.

The defeat of the Socialists at the general election of 1919 appeared to have caused that party to become more extreme in its views. And after much discussion throughout the year 1920, a great Socialist conference held at Tours in December voted by a large majority in favour of adhesion to the so-called Third International, the international organization of Socialists which was under the control of the Bolsheviks of Moscow.

The financial situation in France gave occasion for most serious anxiety. Among other unfavourable features, the exchange value of the franc had fallen greatly since the end of the war, and, with fluctuations, stood at about 60 francs to the pound sterling during most of the year; and the value of the franc in terms of the American dollar was even lower.

The ordinary budget for 1920 provided for a revenue of 15,885,000,000 francs and for an expenditure of 17,860,000,000 francs. It was anticipated that the extraordinary expenditure would amount to over 7,000,000,000 francs.

<text>The Göppingen Gö 4 or Goevier is a German sailplane of the late 1930s used for training pilots. Its most notable features include side-by-side seating and dual controls, making the plane ideal for use as a trainer. It boasted average performance, compared to other gliders of the day, and was advertised as making the process of learning to fly sailplanes easier.

==Design and development==
The Goevier (or Gövier; Gö 4 read aloud in German) was designed as a modern trainer with side-by-side seating for easy communication between student and tutor, with performance comparable to that of the intermediate single seat trainers of the day such as the Grunau Baby and Göppingen Gö 1 Wolf. Its glide angle of 19:1 was rather better than that of both these aircraft (17:1).

It is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane. The wing has a single spar and a plywood covered D-box nose; aft of the spar the wing is fabric covered. The centre section is of constant chord and the outer panels tapered, with sweep on both edges. Here the trailing edge carries long span, broad chord ailerons with curved edges which extend aft of the centre section trailing edge, giving a roughly elliptical plan.

The side-by-side seat arrangement inevitably makes the front fuselage wider (945 mm; 37.4 in externally) than that of a single or tandem seat aircraft, though as the seats are just ahead of the main spar and the mid-wing placed at shoulder height, the interior opening into the wing roots provides extra working space. These roots were early examples of the use of plastics in gliders, formed from hessian soaked in phenolic resins and shaped in a mould. The cockpit is enclosed with glazing and its roof line runs smoothly into that of the upper fuselage above the wing. The fuselage, plywood covered all over, tapers to the tail where the cross-section is shield shaped. The ply covered tailplane is mounted on a small step above the fuselage; together with the fabric covered elevators the horizontal tail is trapezoidal in plan with rounded tips. The fin and rudder were altered several times during the development of the Goevier, initially with both broad and with the fin extending forward to the leading edge of the tailplane, but on all production models it is narrow and upright, carrying several slightly different rudder designs. From 1941 the rudder was aerodynamically balanced. The Goevier lands on a monowheel undercarriage, with a skid reaching forward from it to the nose and with a small tail skid.

The Goevier V-1 made its first flight on 30 November 1937, piloted by Heinz Kensche. It was often towed by a Klemm Kl 25. Production began at Göppingen the following October.

==Operational history==
In a flight covering 1–3 June 1939, Josef Füringer and Hofmann flew a Goevier to a new world duration record of 49 h 45 min.

A Goevier was used to develop the now ubiquitous Schempp-Hirth airbrake with its parallel ruler action.

During World War II the Goevier was the standard advanced trainer with both the National Socialist Flyers Corps and the Werrmacht Luft gliding units.

Goeviers have been regular attendees at Veteran Glider meetings in the later part of the last century. In 2010 one Goevier II and four Goevier IIIs remained on the civil registers of European countries, three in Germany and two in the Netherlands.

<text>Big Spirit Lake is a natural body of water, approximately in area, in Dickinson County in northwest Iowa in the United States. It is part of the chain of lakes known as the Iowa Great Lakes, the northern shore of the lake straddles the border with Minnesota. It is the largest natural lake in Iowa. The Dakota name for the lake was Minnewaukon. Early French traders named it Lac d&#x27;Esprit after the Native legends of an evil spirit who dwelled in the lake.

Its maximum depth is 24 feet (7.3 m), and the mean depth is 17 feet (5 m). The drainage area of the lake is approximately 22 square miles (57 km²). It has a drainage area of approximately 75 mi² (194 km²), most of which is in Minnesota.

==Geology==
Geologically, the lake, like its neighbors, is a glacial pothole, a remnant of the most recent ice age approximately 13,000 years ago.

==Recreation==
The lake is a popular fishing destination in the region. It contains over 40 species of fish, 13 of which are typically caught. Fishing for walleye and yellow perch is typically done by boat or through the ice. Fishing for bullhead is common from the shore during the spring. A state-operated fish hatchery also provides significant populations of largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, muskie, crappie, and bluegill.

The Iowa all-time big fish records for freshwater drum and muskellunge were set from catches in the lake.

Kiteboarding is also a popular activity on Big Spirit Lake.

<text>USS &quot;Altamaha&quot; (AVG-18/ACV-18/CVE-18) was an escort aircraft carrier in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for the Altamaha River in Georgia.

&quot;Altamaha&quot; was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 235) on 19 December 1941 at Tacoma, Washington, by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 25 May 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas S. Combs, the wife of Commander Combs, who was the commanding officer of , and commissioned on 15 September 1942 Captain J. R. Tate in command.

==Service history==
Following brief sea trials, &quot;Altamaha&quot; got underway for San Diego, California, on 27 October in company with . While they were en route, &quot;Kendrick&quot; spotted a submarine and claimed that members of her crew had seen three torpedoes which had been fired at the escort carrier. However, no one on &quot;Altamaha&quot; observed any of the torpedoes. The voyage continued uneventfully, and the ships reached San Diego on 31 October. The carrier then took on aircraft and passengers and sailed in convoy on 3 November for the southwest Pacific.

Upon reaching Espiritu Santo on 22 November, she delivered part of her cargo and departed on 27 November for New Caledonia. She reached Nouméa on 28 November and commenced a period of flight operations and training exercises. The vessel returned to Espiritu Santo on 30 December, but continued on to the Fiji Islands and touched at Nadi on 13 January 1943 before beginning another period of operational training.

In early February, &quot;Altamaha&quot; paused off Funafuti, Ellice Islands; loaded cargo and personnel on to barges and sent them ashore. The carrier then proceeded to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 February. There, the planes and personnel of Air Group 11 came on board, and the ship set a course for the Fiji Islands on 19 February. She reached Nadi on 28 February, discharged her cargo, and reversed her course back toward the Hawaiian Islands.

After a short stay in port at Pearl Harbor, the escort carrier got underway on 9 March with replacement aircraft for the flattops of the Pacific Fleet. She paused at Palmyra Island on 15 March, continued on to Johnston Island debarked marine aviation personnel on 17 March, and touched at Midway Atoll three days later before reversing course and returning to Hawaii. She remained at Pearl Harbor for one day, 23 March, and then continued on to the West Coast.

&quot;Altamaha&quot; reached San Diego on 1 April and commenced three and one-half months of flight operations off the California coast alternated with upkeep in San Diego. On 13 July, she arrived at Alameda, California, to take on planes from the naval air station there. The escort carrier got underway for Australia three days later and made Brisbane on 3 August. Following a 10-day visit to Fremantle, Western Australia, she got underway on 16 August for India and arrived at Karachi on 28 August and delivered 29 Army Air Force airplanes.

On 2 September, the escort carrier reversed her course and steamed back to Australia. She reached Melbourne on 18 September and, at the end of three days there in a leave and upkeep status got underway for the West Coast of the United States. On 8 October, the vessel entered the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, for overhaul.

The escort carrier got underway for sea trials on 8 November paused briefly at Alameda to take on replacement aircraft, and sailed on 13 November for Brisbane. &quot;Altamaha&quot; reached her destination on 30 November and began discharging her cargo. The ship left there on 4 December to return home. Upon her arrival at San Diego on 21 December, she began a period of local operations carrier qualifications, and repairs. During refueling operations off San Diego, blimp K-29 of USN Airship Patrol Squadron 31 (ZP-31) made the first carrier landing by a non-rigid airship on the deck of CVE Altamaha on 4 February 1944.

The ship got underway for Pearl Harbor on 22 March 1944 arrived there on 28 March, and began taking on Composite Squadron 6 for transportation to an operating area 300 miles east of the Marshall Islands. The carrier had been selected to be the nucleus of Task Group 11.1 (TG 11.1), and left Hawaii in company with four destroyer escorts on 30 March. The warships reached their assigned area on 3 April and began their first patrol. The group reported contacting two submarines but did not receive credit for damaging or destroying either. The task group put into Majuro Atoll on 8 April to allow the destroyer escorts to refuel.

The ships sailed on 11 April to carry out a second anti-submarine warfare mission. &quot;Altamaha&quot; was the target of a torpedo attack on 15 April but successfully evaded all four shots. The remainder of the patrol passed uneventfully before TG 11.1 was relieved on 18 April and shaped a course for Pearl Harbor. Following a short upkeep period in Hawaiian waters, the carrier returned to Majuro in early May and operated in an antisubmarine screen off the Marshall Islands for several days before returning to Pearl Harbor on 11 May.

After a two-day layover in Hawaii, &quot;Altamaha&quot; pushed on toward the West Coast. Reaching Alameda on 18 May, she entered the shipyard of the United Engineering Company for repairs and alterations. She resumed operations on the last day in May and headed for Hawaii, laden with aircraft and spare parts.

Having delivered her cargo at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Altamaha&quot; returned to Alameda. From there, she proceeded to San Diego which she reached on 19 June and spent two days loading men and equipment before departing California on 21 June, bound for the New Hebrides. She reached Espiritu Santo on 7 July, discharged cargo and, on 12 July, headed for Morobe, New Guinea, where she arrived on 16 July. Having made additional calls at Langemak, New Guinea, and Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, &quot;Altamaha&quot; arrived back at Espiritu Santo on the 25th. She made one more cruise from this island, during which she visited Seeadler Harbor and Guadalcanal. The carrier departed the New Hebrides on 10 August bound for Hawaii.

&quot;Altamaha&quot; paused at Pearl Harbor for two days and then sailed on to San Diego. She spent four days there before getting underway and setting course for Pearl Harbor. She departed Hawaiian waters on 8 September, made port calls at Emirau Island and Seeadler Harbor, and returned to San Diego, where she arrived on 6 October. The vessel next spent three weeks in local operations before getting underway on 26 October for another voyage west.

The escort carrier paused at Pearl Harbor for three days, then sailed for Eniwetok with replacement aircraft and pilots. On 15 November, she reached Ulithi and then carried out flight operations off Ulithi through 14 December, when she got underway for the 3rd Fleet replenishment area. On 16 December, the ship joined TG 30.8 in the Philippine Sea and, the next day, began transferring pilots to . However, heavy seas compelled her to break off that task. By early morning on 18 December, the disturbance had grown into a raging typhoon. By 0900, the escort carrier was laboring heavily and rolling as much as 25-30 degrees to either side. An hour later, visibility dropped to zero, and the vessel abandoned all effort to keep station. Almost one-half of the aircraft on board &quot;Altamaha&quot; broke loose and plunged overboard. The ship also experienced problems with flooding in the forward elevator pit. By 1600, the weather was improving and the ship rode better. Soon she made a rendezvous with other members of TG 30.8.

While the carrier sustained considerable material damage, she suffered no personnel casualties and was able to resume her resupply operations on 19 December. &quot;Altamaha&quot; continued her operations with the replenishment group through early February 1945. During this time, she serviced 3rd Fleet units in Philippine waters and made port calls at Guam, Manus and Ulithi. On 15 February, the ship touched at Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Altamaha&quot; continued on to the West Coast, arriving at Alameda on 26 February. The ship began an availability at the Hunters Point Navy Yard on 3 March during which she was dry-docked for routine work below the waterline and repairs to a propeller damaged in the typhoon. The carrier emerged from the yard on 14 March and began loading planes, ammunition, and supplies for transportation to Pearl Harbor.

During the remaining months of World War II, &quot;Altamaha&quot; provided general transportation service from Alameda, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor to various points in the Pacific. Among her stops were Guam, Saipan, Eniwetok, Kossol Roads and Samar. Following the Japanese capitulation in mid-August &quot;Altamaha&quot; returned to the West Coast for repairs and an overhaul at the Hunters Point Navy Yard. She began sea trials in mid-October and got underway for Pearl Harbor on the 22nd. The vessel was then assigned to the &quot;Magic-Carpet&quot; fleet and transported armed forces personnel and equipment throughout the Pacific back to the United States.

On 15 January 1946, &quot;Altamaha&quot; headed to Tacoma, Washington. Deactivation preparations were begun there, and the carrier was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 September 1946. The ship was redesignated CVHE-18 on 12 June 1955. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and the vessel was sold on 25 April 1961 to Eisenberg &amp; Co., New York City, N.Y., and, later that year, was scrapped in Japan.

<doc id="463084" wikidata="Q3099766" url="?curid=463084" title="Canada Gazette">
<text>The Canada Gazette () is the official government gazette of the Government of Canada. It was first published on October 2, 1841. While it originally published all acts of the Parliament of Canada, it later also published treaties, hearing and tribunals, proclamations and regulations, and various other official notices as required. At one time it contained information on bankruptcies. It has been administered by Public Works and Government Services Canada and the King&#x27;s Printer for Canada since 1841. The &quot;Gazette&quot; is most often read to find new acts, regulations and proclamations.

==Legal status==
While not always widely read by the public, publication in the &quot;Gazette&quot; is considered official notice to all Canadians. After a regulation has been approved by the Privy Council Office and then the Cabinet of Canada, the regulation is published in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. If a regulation has not been published in the &quot;Gazette&quot;, a person cannot be convicted of the offence.

Canada&#x27;s provinces all have their own equivalents of the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

==Publishing==
From inception in 1841 until 1998, the &quot;Gazette&quot; was published in print only. From 1998 until April 1, 2014, it was published in print and online, with the online version having the same official status as the printed version starting in 2003. Since April 1, 2014, it has only been published online to satisfy a Government of Canada requirement to make &quot;electronic publishing its new standard for all documents&quot;. Structurally, the &quot;Gazette&quot; is published in three parts:

===Part I===
Part I is published each Saturday. It contains public notices, official appointments and proposed regulations, as well as miscellaneous notices from the private sector that are required to be published by federal statute or by regulations. The proposed regulations are published in Part I as a way for the public to comment on them. Once the regulations are pre-published, the department that sponsored the legislation collects public comments to allow for any changes to be made to the regulation. Recently, Notices of Vacancies for senior positions in the government are published here as well.

===Part II===
Part II is published every second Wednesday and it contains all regulations that have been enacted as well as statutory instruments and other documents, such as orders-in-council, orders and proclamations. It has a consolidated index of regulations dating since January 1, 1955.

===Part III===
Part III is published with the text of any new laws immediately after they have received Royal Assent and was first published in 1974. Starting from January 1998, all publications other than Part III are available in HTML and are not official. From April 1, 2003, the PDF version is an official version, as it is marked up from the same file as the printed version. It also contains a list of the proclamations of Canada and orders-in-council relating to the coming into force of federal acts.

==Exemptions==
Certain types of regulations do not need to be published in the &quot;Gazette&quot;. These include regulations that affect only a limited number of people, those for which their publication would counter national defence or international relations, or if their publication would violate personal privacy, such as notices of paroles and pardons.
