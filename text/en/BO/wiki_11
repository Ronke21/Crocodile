<text>The Georgian scripts are the three writing systems used to write the Georgian language: [[#Asomtavruli|Asomtavruli]], [[#Nuskhuri|Nuskhuri]] and [[#Mkhedruli|Mkhedruli]]. Although the systems differ in appearance, their letters share the same names and alphabetical order and are written horizontally from left to right. Of the three scripts, Mkhedruli, once the official script of the Kingdom of Georgia and mostly used for the royal charters, is now the standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only by the Georgian Orthodox Church, in ceremonial religious texts and iconography. It is one of the three historical alphabets of the South Caucasus.

Georgian scripts are unique in their appearance and their exact origin has never been established; however, in strictly structural terms, their alphabetical order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet, with the exception of letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end. Originally consisting of 38 letters, Georgian is presently written in a 33-letter alphabet, as five letters are obsolete. The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies. Mingrelian uses 36: thirty-three that are current Georgian letters, one obsolete Georgian letter, and two additional letters specific to Mingrelian and Svan. Laz uses the same 33 current Georgian letters as Mingrelian plus that same obsolete letter and a letter borrowed from Greek for a total of 35. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but when it is, it uses Georgian letters as utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional obsolete Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by diacritics for its many vowels.

The &quot;living culture of three writing systems of the Georgian alphabet&quot; was granted the national status of intangible cultural heritage in Georgia in 2015 and inscribed on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2016.

== Origins ==

The origin of the Georgian script is poorly known, and no full agreement exists among Georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation, who designed the script, and the main influences on that process.

The first attested version of the script is &quot;Asomtavruli&quot;, which dates back to the 5th century; the other scripts were formed in the following centuries. Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian script to the process of Christianization of Iberia (not to be confused with the Iberian Peninsula), a core Georgian kingdom of Kartli. The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King Mirian III (326 or 337) and the Bir el Qutt inscriptions of 430. It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into Georgian, by monks in Georgia and Palestine. Professor Levan Chilashvili&#x27;s dating of fragmented &quot;Asomtavruli&quot; inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of Nekresi, in Georgia&#x27;s easternmost province of Kakheti, in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been accepted.

A Georgian tradition first attested in the medieval chronicle &quot;Lives of the Kings of Kartli&quot; (), assigns a much earlier, pre-Christian origin to the Georgian alphabet, and names King Pharnavaz I (3rd century BC) as its inventor. This account is now considered legendary, and is rejected by scholarly consensus, as no archaeological confirmation has been found. Georgian linguist Tamaz Gamkrelidze offers an alternative interpretation of the tradition, in the pre-Christian use of foreign scripts to write down Georgian texts.

Another point of contention among scholars is the role played by Armenian clerics in that process. According to medieval Armenian sources and a number of scholars, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also allegedly created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth-century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been rejected by Georgian scholarship and some Western scholars who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. In his study on the history of the invention of the Armenian alphabet and the life of Mashtots, the Armenian linguist Hrachia Acharian strongly defended Koryun as a reliable source and rejected criticisms of his accounts on the invention of the Georgian script by Mashtots. Acharian dated the invention to 408, four years after Mashtots created the Armenian alphabet (he dated the latter event to 404). Some Western scholars quote Koryun&#x27;s claims without taking a stance on its validity or concede that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must have played a role in the creation of the Georgian script. Ivane Javakhishvili, a Georgian historian and scientist, studied this work of Koryun and concluded that the version of Mesrop Mashtots&#x27; creation of the Georgian alphabet is a VI-VII century addition. However, the 5th-century Armenian historian Ghazar Parpetsi considers Mashtots to be the creator of only the Armenian alphabet.

Another controversy regards the main influences at play in the Georgian alphabet, as scholars have debated whether it was inspired more by the Greek alphabet, or by Semitic alphabets such as Aramaic. Recent historiography focuses on greater similarities with the Greek alphabet than in the other Caucasian writing systems, most notably the order and numeric value of letters. Some scholars have also suggested certain pre-Christian Georgian cultural symbols or clan markers as a possible inspiration for particular letters.

== &quot;Asomtavruli&quot; ==

Asomtavruli (, ; ) is the oldest Georgian script. The name means &quot;capital letters&quot;, from () &quot;letter&quot; and () &quot;principal/head&quot;. It is also known as Mrgvlovani () &quot;rounded&quot;, from () &quot;round&quot;, so named because of its round letter shapes. Despite its name, this &quot;capital&quot; script is unicameral.

The oldest Asomtavruli inscriptions found so far date from the 5th century and are Bir el Qutt and the Bolnisi inscriptions.

From the 9th century, Nuskhuri script started becoming dominant, and the role of Asomtavruli was reduced. However, epigraphic monuments of the 10th to 18th centuries continued to be written in Asomtavruli script. Asomtavruli in this later period became more decorative. In the majority of 9th-century Georgian manuscripts which were written in Nuskhuri script, Asomtavruli was used for titles and the first letters of chapters. However, some manuscripts written completely in Asomtavruli can be found until the 11th century.

===Form of Asomtavruli letters===
In early Asomtavruli, the letters are of equal height. Georgian historian and philologist Pavle Ingorokva believes that the direction of Asomtavruli, like that of Greek, was initially boustrophedon, though the direction of the earliest surviving texts is from left to the right.

In most Asomtavruli letters, straight lines are horizontal or vertical and meet at right angles. The only letter with acute angles is Ⴟ (&quot;jani&quot;). There have been various attempts to explain this exception. Georgian linguist and art historian Helen Machavariani believes &quot;jani&quot; derives from a monogram of Christ, composed of (&quot;ini&quot;) and (&quot;kani&quot;). According to Georgian scholar Ramaz Pataridze, the cross-like shape of letter &quot;jani&quot; indicates the end of the alphabet, and has the same function as the similarly shaped Phoenician letter taw (), Greek chi (Χ), and Latin X, though these letters do not have that function in Phoenician, Greek, or Latin.

From the 7th century, the forms of some letters began to change. The equal height of the letters was abandoned, with letters acquiring ascenders and descenders.

===Asomtavruli illumination===
In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli are used for titles and illuminated capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In the early stages of the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.

From the 11th-century &quot;limb-flowery&quot;, &quot;limb-arrowy&quot; and &quot;limb-spotty&quot; decorative forms of Asomtavruli are developed. The first two are found in 11th- and 12th-century monuments, whereas the third one is used until the 18th century.

Importance was attached also to the colour of the ink itself.

Asomtavruli letter Ⴃ (&quot;doni&quot;) is often written with decoration effects of fish and birds.

The &quot;Curly&quot; decorative form of Asomtavruli is also used where the letters are wattled or intermingled on each other, or the smaller letters are written inside other letters. It was mostly used for the headlines of the manuscripts or the books, although there are complete inscriptions which were written in the Asomtavruli &quot;Curly&quot; form only.

===Handwriting of Asomtavruli===
The following table shows the stroke direction of each Asomtavruli letter:

== &quot;Nuskhuri&quot; ==

Nuskhuri (, ; ) is the second Georgian script. The name comes from (), meaning &quot;inventory&quot; or &quot;schedule&quot;. Nuskhuri was soon augmented with Asomtavruli illuminated capitals in religious manuscripts. The combination is called Khutsuri (, ; &quot;clerical&quot;, from ( &quot;cleric&quot;), and it was principally used in hagiography.

Nuskhuri first appeared in the 9th century as a graphic variant of Asomtavruli. The oldest inscription is found in the Ateni Sioni Church and dates to 835 AD. The oldest surviving Nuskhuri manuscripts date to 864 AD. Nuskhuri becomes dominant over Asomtavruli from the 10th century.

===Form of Nuskhuri letters===
Nuskhuri letters vary in height, with ascenders and descenders, and are slanted to the right. Letters have an angular shape, with a noticeable tendency to simplify the shapes they had in Asomtavruli. This enabled faster writing of manuscripts.


:&quot;Note: Without proper font support, you may see question marks, boxes or other symbols instead of Nuskhuri letters.&quot;

==Use of &quot;Asomtavruli&quot; and &quot;Nuskhuri&quot; today==
Asomtavruli is used intensively in iconography, murals, and exterior design, especially in stone engravings. Georgian linguist Akaki Shanidze made an attempt in the 1950s to introduce Asomtavruli into the Mkhedruli script as capital letters to begin sentences, as in the Latin script, but it did not catch on. Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are officially used by the Georgian Orthodox Church alongside Mkhedruli. Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia called on people to use all three Georgian scripts.

== &quot;Mkhedruli&quot; ==

Mkhedruli (; ) is the third and current Georgian script. Mkhedruli, literally meaning &quot;cavalry&quot; or &quot;military&quot;, derives from () meaning &quot;horseman&quot;, &quot;knight&quot;, &quot;warrior&quot; and &quot;cavalier&quot;.

Mkhedruli is bicameral, with capital letters that are called Mkhedruli Mtavruli () or simply Mtavruli (; ). Nowadays, Mkhedruli Mtavruli is only used in all-caps text in titles or to emphasize a word, though in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was occasionally used, as in Latin and Cyrillic scripts, to capitalize proper nouns or the first word of a sentence. Contemporary Georgian script does not recognize capital letters and their usage has become decorative.

Mkhedruli first appears in the 10th century. The oldest Mkhedruli inscription is found in Ateni Sioni Church dating back to 982 AD. The second oldest Mkhedruli-written text is found in the 11th-century royal charters of King Bagrat IV of Georgia. Mkhedruli was mostly used then in the Kingdom of Georgia for the royal charters, historical documents, manuscripts and inscriptions. Mkhedruli was used for non-religious purposes only and represented the &quot;civil&quot;, &quot;royal&quot; and &quot;secular&quot; script.

Mkhedruli became more and more dominant over the two other scripts, though Khutsuri (Nuskhuri with Asomtavruli) was used until the 19th century. Mkhedruli became the universal writing Georgian system outside of the Church in the 19th century with the establishment and development of printed Georgian fonts.

===Form of Mkhedruli letters===
Mkhedruli inscriptions of the 10th and 11th centuries are characterized in rounding of angular shapes of Nuskhuri letters and making the complete outlines in all of its letters. Mkhedruli letters are written in the four-linear system, similar to Nuskhuri.
Mkhedruli becomes more round and free in writing. It breaks the strict frame of the previous two alphabets, Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri. Mkhedruli letters begin to get coupled and more free calligraphy develops.


===Modern Georgian alphabet===
The modern Georgian alphabet consists of 33 letters:

=== Letters removed from the Georgian alphabet ===
The Society for the Spreading of Literacy among Georgians, founded by Prince Ilia Chavchavadze in 1879, discarded five letters from the Georgian alphabet that had become redundant:

*ჱ (&quot;he&quot;) /eɪ/ (like the ay in pay), Svan /eː/ (like the e in egg in some American and Canadian accents), sometimes called &quot;&quot;ei&quot; or &quot;e-merve&quot;&quot; (&quot;eighth &quot;e&quot;&quot;), was equivalent to ეჲ &quot;ey&quot;, as in ქრისტჱ ~ ქრისტეჲ &quot;kristʼey&quot; &#x27;Christ&#x27;.
*ჲ (&quot;hie&quot;) /je/ (like the word &quot;yeah&quot;), but also called &quot;yota&quot;, appeared instead of ი (&quot;ini&quot;) after a vowel, but came to have the same pronunciation as ი (&quot;ini&quot;) and was replaced by it. Thus, ქრისტჱ ~ ქრისტეჲ &quot;kristʼey&quot; &quot;Christ&quot; is now written ქრისტე &quot;kristʼe&quot;.
*ჳ (&quot;vie&quot;) /uɪ/ (like a cluster of the oo in too and the i in ill), Svan /w/ (like the w in water) came to be pronounced the same as ვი &quot;vi&quot; and was replaced by that sequence, as in სხჳსი &gt; სხვისი &quot;skhvisi&quot; &quot;others&#x27;&quot;.
*ჴ (&quot;qari&quot;, &quot;hari&quot;) (like the Arabic Qof) came to be pronounced the same as ხ (&quot;khani&quot;), and was replaced by it. e.g. ჴელმწიფე &quot;qelmtsʼipe&quot; became ხელმწიფე &quot;khelmtsʼipe&quot; &quot;sovereign&quot;.
*ჵ (&quot;hoe&quot;) /oː/ (somewhat like the American o in go) was used for the interjection &quot;hoi!&quot; and is now spelled ჰოი. Also used in Bats for the or sound.

All but ჵ (&quot;hoe&quot;) continue to be used in the Svan alphabet; ჲ (&quot;hie&quot;) is used in the Mingrelian and Laz alphabets as well, for the y-sound . Several others were used for Abkhaz and Ossetian in the short time they were written in Mkhedruli script.

=== Letters added to other alphabets ===
Mkhedruli has been adapted to languages besides Georgian. Some of these alphabets retained letters obsolete in Georgian, while others acquired additional letters:
*ჶ (&quot;fi&quot; &quot;phi&quot;) is used in Laz and Svan, and formerly in Ossetian and Abkhazian. It derives from the Greek letter Φ (&quot;phi&quot;).
*ჷ (&quot;shva&quot; &quot;schwa&quot;), also called &quot;yn&quot;, is used for the schwa sound in Svan and Mingrelian, and formerly in Ossetian and Abkhazian.
*ჸ (&quot;elifi&quot; &quot;alif&quot;) is used in for the glottal stop in Svan and Mingrelian. It is a reversed (&quot;q&#x27;ari&quot;). 
*ჹ (&quot;turned gani&quot;) was once used for in evangelical literature in Dagestanian languages.
*ჼ (&quot;modifier nar&quot;) is used in Bats. It nasalizes the preceding vowel.
*ჺ (&quot;aini&quot; &quot;ain&quot;) is occasionally used for in Bats. It derives from the Arabic letter (&quot;ʿayn&quot;)
*ჽ (&quot;aen&quot;) was used in the Ossetian language when it was written in the Georgian script. It was pronounced .
*ჾ (&quot;hard sign&quot;) was used in Abkhaz for velarization of the preceding consonant.
*ჿ (&quot;labial sign&quot;) was used in Abkhaz for labialization of the preceding consonant.

=== Handwriting of Mkhedruli ===
The following table shows the stroke order and direction of each Mkhedruli letter:

ზ, ო, and ხ (&quot;zeni, oni, khani&quot;) are almost always written without the small tick at the end, while the handwritten form of ჯ (&quot;jani&quot;) often uses a vertical line, (sometimes with a taller ascender, or with a diagonal cross bar); even when it is written at a diagonal, the cross-bar is generally shorter than in print.

*Only four letters are x-height, with neither ascenders nor descenders: ა, თ, ი, ო.
*Thirteen have ascenders, like b or d in English: ბ, ზ, მ, ნ, პ, რ, ს, შ, ჩ, ძ, წ, ხ, ჰ
*An equal number have descenders, like p or q in English: გ, დ, ე, ვ, კ, ლ, ჟ, ტ, უ, ფ, ღ, ყ, ც
*Three letters have both ascenders and descenders, like þ in Old English: ქ, ჭ, and (in handwriting) ჯ. წ sometimes has both ascender and descender in handwriting.

====Variation====

There is individual and stylistic variation in many of the letters. For example, the top circle of ზ () and the top stroke of რ () may go in the other direction than shown in the chart (that is, counter-clockwise starting at 3 o&#x27;clock, and upwards – see the external-link section for videos of people writing).

Other common variants:

* გ () may be written like ვ () with a closed loop at the bottom.
* დ () is frequently written with a simple loop at top, .
* კ, ც, and ძ (, , ) are generally written with straight, vertical lines at the top, so that for example ც () resembles a U with a dimple in the right side.
* ლ () is frequently written with a single arc, , a little like a Greek rho symbol ⟨⟩. Even when all three are written, they&#x27;re generally not all the same size, as they are in print, but rather riding on one wide arc like two dimples in it.
* Rarely, ო () is written as a right angle, .
* რ () is frequently written with one arc, , like a Latin .
* ტ () often has a small circle with a tail hanging into the bowl, rather than two small circles as in print, or as an O with a straight vertical line intersecting the top. It may also be rotated a bit clockwise, with the small circles further to the right and not as close to the top.
* წ () is generally written with a round bowl at the bottom, . Another variation features a triangular bowl.
* ჭ () may be written without the hook at the top, and often with a completely straight vertical line.
* ჱ () may be written without the loop, like a conflation of ს and ჰ.
* ჯ () is sometimes written so that it looks like a hooked version of the Latin .

====Similar letters====

Several letters are similar and may be confused at first, especially in handwriting. 
*For ვ (&quot;vini&quot;) and კ (&quot;k&#x27;ani&quot;), the critical difference is whether the top is a full arc or a (more-or-less) vertical line. 
*For ვ (&quot;vini&quot;) and გ (&quot;gani&quot;), it is whether the bottom is an open curve or closed (a loop). The same is true of უ (&quot;uni&quot;) and შ (&quot;shini&quot;); in handwriting, the tops may look the same. Similarly ს (&quot;sani&quot;) and ხ (&quot;khani&quot;).
*For კ (&quot;k&#x27;ani&quot;) and პ (&quot;p&#x27;ari&quot;), the crucial difference is whether the letter is written below or above x-height, and whether it&#x27;s written top-down or bottom-up. 
*ძ (&quot;dzili&quot;) is written with a vertical top.

== Ligatures, abbreviations and calligraphy ==

Asomtavruli is often highly stylized and writers readily formed ligatures, intertwined letters, and placed letters within letters or other such monograms.


Nuskhuri, like Asomtavruli, is also often highly stylized. Writers readily formed ligatures and abbreviations for &quot;nomina sacra&quot;, including diacritics called &quot;karagma&quot;, which resemble &quot;titla&quot;. Because writing materials such as vellum were scarce and therefore precious, abbreviating was a practical measure widespread in manuscripts and hagiography by the 11th century.



Mkhedruli, in the 11th to 17th centuries also came to employ digraphs to the point that they were obligatory, requiring adherence to a complex system.



== Typefaces ==
Georgian scripts come in only a single typeface, though word processors can apply automatic (&quot;fake&quot;) oblique and bold formatting to Georgian text. Traditionally, Asomtavruli was used for chapter or section titles, where Latin script might use bold or italic type.

== Punctuation ==
In Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation, various combinations of dots were used as word dividers and to separate phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of 5th to 10th centuries, these were written as dashes, like −, = and =−. In the 10th century, clusters of one (·), two (:), three () and six (჻჻) dots (later sometimes small circles) were introduced by Ephrem Mtsire to indicate increasing breaks in the text. One dot indicated a &quot;minor stop&quot; (presumably a simple word break), two dots marked or separated &quot;special words&quot;, three dots for a &quot;bigger stop&quot; (such as the appositive name and title &quot;the sovereign Alexander&quot;, below, or the title of the Gospel of Matthew, above), and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence. Starting in the 11th century, marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use. An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word, and a comma appeared at the end of an interrogative sentence. From the 12th century on, these were replaced with the semicolon (the Greek question mark). In the 18th century, Patriarch Anton I of Georgia reformed the system again, with commas, single dots, and double dots used to mark &quot;complete&quot;, &quot;incomplete&quot;, and &quot;final&quot; sentences, respectively. For the most part, Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the Latin script.


== Summary ==

This table lists the three scripts in parallel columns, including the letters that are now obsolete in all alphabets (shown with a blue background), obsolete in Georgian but still used in other alphabets (green background), or additional letters in languages other than Georgian (pink background). The &quot;national&quot; transliteration is the system used by the Georgian government, whereas &quot;Laz&quot; is the Latin Laz alphabet used in Turkey. The table also shows the traditional numeric values of the letters.

== Computing ==


=== Unicode ===
The first Georgian script was included in Unicode Standard in October 1991 with the release of version 1.0. In creating the Georgian Unicode block, important roles were played by German Jost Gippert, a linguist of Kartvelian studies, and American-Irish linguist and script-encoder Michael Everson, who created the Georgian Unicode for the Macintosh systems. Significant contributions were also made by Anton Dumbadze and Irakli Garibashvili (not to be mistaken with the Prime Minister of Georgia Irakli Garibashvili).

Georgian &quot;Mkhedruli&quot; script received an official status for being Georgia&#x27;s internationalized domain name script for (.გე).

Mtavruli letters were added in Unicode version 11.0 in June 2018. They are capital letters with similar letterforms to Mkhedruli, but with descenders shifted above the baseline, with a wider central oval, and with the top slightly higher than the ascender height. Before this addition, font creators included Mtavruli in various ways. Some fonts came in pairs, of which one had lowercase letters and the other uppercase; some Unicode fonts placed Mtavruli letterforms in the Asomtavruli range (U+10A0-U+10CF) or in the Private Use Area, and some ASCII-based ones mapped them to the ASCII capital letters.

==== Blocks ====
Georgian characters are found in three Unicode blocks. The first block (U+10A0–U+10FF) is simply called Georgian. Mkhedruli (modern Georgian) occupies the U+10D0–U+10FF range (shown in the bottom half of the first table below) and Asomtavruli occupies the U+10A0–U+10CF range (shown in the top half of the same table). The second block is the Georgian Supplement (U+2D00–U+2D2F), and it contains Nuskhuri. Mtavruli capitals are included in the Georgian Extended block (U+1C90–U+1CBF).

Mtavruli is defined as the upper case, but not title case, of Mkhedruli, and Asomtavruli as the upper case and title case of Nuskhuri.

===Non-Unicode encodings===
Mac OS Georgian is an unofficial character encoding created by Michael Everson for Georgian on classic Mac OS. It is an extended ASCII encoding, using the 128 code points from 0x80 through 0xFF to represent the characters of the Asomtavruli and Mkhedruli scripts plus a number of widely-used symbols not included in 7-bit ASCII.

<text>According to Latter Day Saint theology, seer stones were used by Joseph Smith, as well as ancient prophets, to receive revelations from God. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) believe that Smith used seer stones to translate the Book of Mormon.

The culture that early Latter Day Saints developed in was steeped in Western esotericism, which included American folk magic practices. A seer stone in this culture was a prevalent divination tool used for a form of crystal gazing, or scrying.

Seer stones are mentioned in the Book of Mormon in the Book of Mosiah, where they are also called &quot;interpreters&quot; and described as being used by seers to translate and receive revelations. The term &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; is usually used by Latter Day Saints members to refer to the &quot;interpreters&quot; mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Some Latter Day Saints use the term Urim and Thummim and seer stones interchangeably.

Smith owned at least two seer stones before his early twenties, when he had employed them for treasure seeking at the bequest of Josiah Stowell, before he founded the church. Other early Mormons, such as Hiram Page, David Whitmer, and Jacob Whitmer, also owned seer stones.

==Seer stones and treasure-hunting==
Some early-19th-century Americans used seer stones in attempts to gain revelations from God or to find buried treasure. From about 1819, Smith regularly practiced scrying, a form of divination in which a &quot;seer&quot; looked into a seer stone to receive supernatural knowledge. Smith&#x27;s usual procedure was to place the stone in a white stovepipe hat, put his face over the hat to block the light, and &quot;see&quot; the necessary information in the stone&#x27;s reflections. Smith and his father achieved &quot;something of a mysterious local reputation in the profession—mysterious because there is no record that they ever found anything despite the readiness of some local residents to pay for their efforts.&quot;

In late 1825, Josiah Stowell, a well-to-do farmer from South Bainbridge, Chenango County, New York, was searching for a lost Spanish mine near Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania with another seer. Stowell traveled to Manchester to hire Smith &quot;on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye.&quot; Smith worked with the Stowell-Hale team for approximately one month, attempting, according to their contract, to locate &quot;a valuable mine of either Gold or Silver and also...coined money and bars or ingots of Gold or Silver&quot;. According to an uncorroborated account by Hale, Smith attempted to locate the mine by burying his face in a hat containing the seer stone; however, as the treasure hunters got close to their objective, Smith said that an enchantment became so strong that Smith could no longer see it. The failed project disbanded on November 17, 1825; however, Smith continued to work for Stowell on other matters until 1826.
In 1826, Smith was arrested and brought to court in Bainbridge, New York, on the complaint of Stowell&#x27;s nephew who accused Smith of being &quot;a disorderly person and an imposter.&quot; Court records show that Smith, identified as &quot;The Glass Looker,&quot; stood before the court on March 20, 1826, on a warrant for an unspecified misdemeanor charge, and that the judge issued a &quot;mittimus&quot; for Smith to be held, either during or after the proceedings. Although Smith&#x27;s associate Oliver Cowdery later stated that Smith was &quot;honorably acquitted,&quot; the result of the proceeding is unclear, with some claiming he was found guilty, others claiming he was &quot;condemned&quot; but &quot;designedly allowed to escape,&quot; and yet others (including the trial note taker) claiming he was &quot;discharged&quot; for lack of evidence.

Martin Harris said that Smith once found a pin in a pile of shavings with the aid of a stone. Smith had at least two seer stones, including a white stone that he found in about 1819, and a chocolate-colored stone that he found in 1822. His favored stone, chocolate-colored and about the size of an egg, was found in a deep well he helped dig for one of his neighbors. In 1827, Smith said he obtained the &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; which was composed of two white stones, different from the previous two.

==Seer stones and the Book of Mormon==

In 1823, Smith said that an angel told him of the existence of golden plates along with &quot;two stones in silver bows&quot; fastened to a breastplate that the angel said God had prepared for translating the plates. In dictating the Book of Mormon, Smith said he used these &quot;interpreters,&quot; which he later referred to as &quot;Urim and Thummim.&quot; Smith&#x27;s wife, Emma, said that Smith used the Urim and Thummim to translate the lost 116 pages of the manuscript, but that Smith translated the published Book of Mormon using the single chocolate-colored stone that he had previously used in treasure-quests.

David Whitmer said, regarding Smith&#x27;s translation of the Book of Mormon:

Other early Mormons, among whom were Jacob and David Whitmer, Philo Dibble, W. W. Phelps, and Elizabeth Ann Whitney, valued seer stones. In 1830, Hiram Page, one of the Eight Witnesses to the Book of Mormon, stated he had a series of revelations through a black seer stone. After Smith announced that these revelations were of the devil, Page agreed to discard the stone which, according to a contemporary, was &quot;Broke to powder and the writings Burnt.&quot; Apparently, the apostasy of some early Mormon believers can be traced to Smith&#x27;s move away from the use of seer stones. The Whitmer family, devoted to their importance, &quot;later said their disenchantment with Mormonism began when Joseph Smith stopped using his seer stone as an instrument of revelation.&quot; In November 1837, the Kirtland high council disfellowshipped 11-year-old James C. Brewster, his parents, and several associates for claiming that he had &quot;the gift of seeing and looking through or into a stone.&quot; Nevertheless, some Mormons continued to believe in the power of seer stones. After Smith&#x27;s death, Brigham Young endorsed their use. In 1855, he reminisced, &quot;Joseph said there is a [seer] Stone for every person on Earth.&quot; At the first general conference after Smith&#x27;s death, Young declared, &quot;The president of the priests has a right to the Urim and Thummim, which gives revelation.&quot; James Strang, who led a small breakaway group after Smith&#x27;s death, proclaiming himself Smith&#x27;s successor, claimed he unearthed ancient metal plates, known as the Voree plates, and translated them using a seer stone.

==Urim and Thummim==
In the Book of Mormon, prophets such as the Brother of Jared and Mosiah used devices called &quot;interpreters&quot; to receive revelation for their people, and the Doctrine and Covenants declares these interpreters to have been Urim and Thummim.

The LDS Church teaches that the Urim and Thummim used by Smith and the Book of Mormon were the functional equivalent of the Urim and Thummim mentioned in the Old Testament. There is no indication whether or not the Old Testament Urim and Thummim were used to translate documents. Some church members believe that there were three different Urim and Thummim: the one of the Old Testament and two mentioned in the Book of Mormon, one used by the Jaredites and the other by King Mosiah. (The Church teaches that the one used by Smith is the one originally possessed by the Jaredites.)

Sometime after 1828, Smith and his early contemporaries began to use the terms &quot;seer stone&quot; and &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; interchangeably, referring to Smith&#x27;s brown stone as a &quot;Urim and Thummim.&quot; D. Michael Quinn argues Smith eventually began using &quot;biblical terminology to mainstream an instrument and practice of folk magic... There was no reference to the Urim and Thummim in the headings of the Book of Commandments (1833) or in the headings of the only editions of the Doctrine and Covenants prepared during Smith&#x27;s life.&quot; Early Mormons often referred to Smith&#x27;s seer stone as &quot;the Urim and Thummim,&quot; and Quinn refers to the term &quot;Urim and Thummim&quot; as a &quot;euphemism for Joseph Smith&#x27;s seer stone.&quot; The LDS Church has suggested that Smith and others &quot;seem to have understood the term [Urim and Thummim] more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations and less as the name of a specific instrument&quot;.

==Seer stones and the contemporary Restored Church==
After finishing the Book of Mormon translation, Smith is said to have given his brown seer stone to Oliver Cowdery, but he occasionally used his white stone to gain revelations, including his translation of what later became known as the Book of Abraham. There is no evidence that Smith used the stone to dictate any of the Doctrine and Covenants revelations after November 1830. During his work on his Bible translation, Smith told Orson Pratt he had stopped using the stone because he had become acquainted with &quot;the Spirit of Prophecy and Revelation&quot; and no longer needed it. Nevertheless, in 1855, Brigham Young told the apostles that Smith had had five seer stones, and Young made it clear that Smith &quot;did not regard his seer stones simply as relics of his youth&quot; but had found others while church president.

According to apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, the LDS Church owns one of Smith&#x27;s seer stones. Nevertheless, since the nineteenth century, no president of the church has openly used such a stone in his role as &quot;prophet, seer, and revelator&quot;.

In August 2015, the LDS Church released images of one of Smith&#x27;s seer stones—a rounded, smoothed, brown and black stone—in a volume of the Joseph Smith Papers Project containing the printer&#x27;s manuscript of the Book of Mormon. The stone shown in the released images has been identified by geologists as a form of jasper, found in a banded iron formation, thus called banded jasper.

<doc id="448564" wikidata="Q2587830" url="?curid=448564" title="Pardo Brazilians">
<text>In Brazil, Pardo () is an ethno-racial and skin color category used by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) in the Brazilian censuses. The term &quot;pardo&quot; is a complex one, more commonly used to refer to Brazilians of mixed ethnic ancestries.

Pardo Brazilians represent a diverse range of skin colors and ethnic backgrounds. The other recognized census categories are &quot;branco&quot; (&quot;white&quot;), &quot;preto&quot; (&quot;black&quot;), &quot;amarelo&quot; (&quot;yellow&quot;, meaning ethnic East Asians), and &quot;indígena&quot; (&quot;indigene&quot; or &quot;indigenous person&quot;, meaning Amerindians). The term was and is still commonly used, in popular culture and the media, to refer to Brazilians of multi ethnic backgrounds.

==Definitions==

According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), &quot;pardo&quot; is a broad classification that encompasses multiracial Brazilians such as &quot;mulatos&quot; and &quot;cafuzos&quot;, as well as assimilated Amerindians known as &quot;caboclos&quot;, mixed with Southern Europeans or not. The term &quot;pardo&quot; was first used in a Brazilian census in 1872. The following census, in 1890, replaced the word &quot;pardo&quot; by &quot;mestiço&quot; (that of mixed origins). The censuses of 1900 and 1920 did not ask about race, arguing that &quot;the answers largely hide the truth&quot;.

In Brazil, the term &quot;pardo&quot; has had a general meaning since the beginning of the Portuguese colonization. In the famous letter by Pero Vaz de Caminha, for example, in which Brazil was first described by the Portuguese, the Native Americans were called &quot;pardo&quot;: &quot;Pardo, naked, without clothing&quot;.

A reading of colonial wills and testaments also shows it. Diogo de Vasconcelos, a widely known historian from Minas Gerais, mentions, for example, the story of Andresa de Castilhos. According to the information from the 18th century, Andresa de Castilhos was thus described: &quot;I declare that Andresa de Castilhos, pardo woman ... has been freed ... is a descendant of the natives of the land ... I declare that Andresa de Castilhos is the daughter of a white man and a native woman&quot;.

The historian Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende also explains that the word pardo was employed to name people with native ancestry or even Native Americans themselves: a Manoel, natural son of Ana carijó, was baptized as a &#x27;pardo&#x27;; in Campanha several Native Americans were classified as &#x27;pardo&#x27;; the natives João Ferreira, Joana Rodriges and Andreza Pedrosa, for example, were named &#x27;freed pardo&#x27;; a Damaso called himself &#x27;freed pardo&#x27; of the &#x27;native of the land&#x27;; etc.

According to Maria Leônia Chaves de Resende, the growth of the pardo population in Brazil includes the descendants of natives and not only those of African descent: &quot;the growth of the &#x27;pardo&#x27; segment had not only to do with the descendants of Africans, but also with the descendants of the natives, in particular the carijós and bastards, included in the condition of &#x27;pardo&#x27;&quot;.

The American historian Muriel Nazzari specifically pointed out the &quot;pardo&quot; category absorbed those of Native American descent in São Paulo: &quot;This paper seeks to demonstrate that, though many Indians and mestizos did migrate, those who remained in São Paulo came to be classified as pardos&quot;
The question about race reappeared in the 1940 census. In this census, &quot;pardo&quot; was not given as an option, but if the answer was different from the options &quot;white&quot;, &quot;black&quot; and &quot;yellow&quot;, a horizontal line would be drawn into the &quot;color&quot; box. When the census data was tabulated, all responses with horizontal lines were collected into the single category of &quot;pardo&quot;. The term &quot;pardo&quot; was not used as an option as an assurance to the public that census data would not be used for discriminatory purposes due to rising South European racist sentiment at the time. In the 1950 census, &quot;pardo&quot; was actually added as a choice of answer. This trend remains, with the exception of the 1970 census, which also did not ask about race.

The 20th century saw a large growth of the &quot;pardo&quot; population. In 1940, 21.2% of Brazilians were classified as &quot;pardos&quot;. In 2000, they had increased to 38.5% of the population. This came only partially due to the continuous process of miscegenation. In the 20th century, a growing number of Brazilians who used to self-report as Black in earlier censuses chose to move to the Pardo category. Also a significant part of the population that used to self-report as white also moved to the Pardo category. This indicates not so much a changing of demographics but an evolution of perceptions and ideologies prevalent at each historical moment, and a growing racial and social awareness. Magnoli describes this phenomenon as the &quot;pardização&quot; (&quot;pardoization&quot;) of Brazil.

== Ancestry ==
According to an autosomal DNA study (the autosomal study is about the sum of the ancestors of a person, unlike mtDNA or yDNA haplogroup studies, which cover only one single line), the &quot;pardos&quot; in Rio de Janeiro were found to be predominantly European, at roughly 70% (see table). The geneticist Sérgio Pena criticized foreign scholar Edward Telles for lumping &quot;blacks&quot; and &quot;pardos&quot; in the same category, given the predominantly European ancestry of the &quot;pardos&quot; throughout Brazil. According to him, &quot;the autosomal genetic analysis that we have performed in non-related individuals from Rio de Janeiro shows that it does not make any sense to put &quot;blacks&quot; and &quot;pardos&quot; in the same category&quot;.

Another autosomal DNA study has confirmed that the European ancestry is dominant throughout in the Brazilian population, regardless of complexion, &quot;pardos&quot; included. &quot;A new portrayal of each ethnic contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific magazine &#x27;American Journal of Human Biology&#x27; by a team from the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin, eye, and hair color have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, as has been shown in previous studies&quot;. &quot;Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. The Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, &quot;with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085)&quot;. The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bio-anthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.&quot; It is important to note that &quot;the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: &quot;the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although &quot;likely to be leaning slightly towards the ‘‘pardo’’ group&quot;&quot;.

According to another autosomal DNA study conducted on a school in the poor periphery of Rio de Janeiro the &quot;pardos&quot; there were found to be on average over 80% European, and the &quot;whites&quot; (who thought of themselves as &quot;very mixed&quot;) were found out to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. &quot;The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self-made estimates of European ancestry&quot;, say the researchers. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The &quot;pardos&quot; for example thought of themselves as 1/3 European, 1/3 African and 1/3 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry was determined to be at over 80% European.

An autosomal study from 2011 (with nearly almost 1,000 samples from all over the country, &quot;whites&quot;, &quot;pardos&quot; and &quot;blacks&quot;) has also concluded that European ancestry is the predominant ancestry in Brazil, accounting for nearly 70% of the ancestry of the population. &quot;In all regions studied, the European ancestry was predominant, with proportions ranging from 60.6% in the Northeast to 77.7% in the South&quot;. The &quot;pardos&quot; included were found to be predominantly European in ancestry on average. The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constitute the great majority of blood donors in Brazil), and also public health institutions personnel and health students.


==History==

The formation of the Brazilian people is characterized by the mixing of whites, blacks and Indians. According to geneticist Sérgio Pena, &quot;with the exception of immigrants of first or second generation, there is no Brazilian who does not carry a bit of African and Amerindian genetic&quot;. &quot;The correlation between color and genomic ancestry is imperfect: at the individual level one cannot safely predict the skin color of a person from his/her level of European, African and Amerindian ancestry nor the opposite. Regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a high degree of European ancestry. Also, regardless of their skin color, the overwhelming majority of Brazilians have a significant degree of African ancestry. Finally, most Brazilians have a significant and very uniform degree of Amerindian ancestry.

The high ancestral variability observed in whites and blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes&quot; (geneticist Sérgio Pena). The colonization of Brazil was characterized by a small proportion of women among the initial settlers. As there was a male predominance in the European contingent present in Brazil, most sexual partners of those settlers were, initially, Amerindian or African women, and, later, mixed-race women. This sexual asymmetry is marked on the genetics of the Brazilian people, regardless of skin color: there is a predominance of European Y chromosomes, and of Amerindian and African MtDNA. Haplogroup frequencies do not determine phenotype nor admixture. They are very general genetic snapshots, primarily useful in examining past population group migratory patterns. Only autosomal DNA testing can reveal admixture structures, since it analyzes millions of alleles from both maternal and paternal sides. Contrary to yDNA or mtDNA, which are focused on one single lineage (paternal or maternal) the autosomal DNA studies profile the whole ancestry of a given individual, being more accurate in describing the complex patterns of ancestry in a given place. In the Brazilian &quot;white&quot; and &quot;pardos&quot; the autosomal ancestry (the sum of the ancestors of a given individual) tends to be largely European, with often a non-European mtDNA (which points to a non-European ancestor somewhere up the maternal line), which is explained by the women marrying newly arrived colonists, during the formation of the Brazilian people.

In the first century of colonization, there was interbreeding between Portuguese males and Amerindian females in Brazil. However, the Amerindian population was decimated by epidemics, wars and slavery. Since 1550, African slaves began to be brought to Brazil in large numbers. Miscegenation between Portuguese males and African females was common. European and Asiatic immigrants who came to Brazil in the 19th and 20th centuries (Portuguese, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Arab, Japanese, etc.) also participated in the process. Among many of the immigrant groups in Brazil, there was a large predominance of men.

In all Brazilian regions, European, African and Amerindian genetic markers are found in the local populations, even though the proportion of each varies from region to region and from individual to individual. However, most regions showed basically the same structure, a greater European contribution to the population, followed by African and Native American contributions: &quot;Some people had the vision Brazil was a heterogeneous mosaic. ... Our study proves Brazil is a lot more integrated than some expected&quot;. Brazilian homogeneity is, therefore, greater within regions than between them:

An autosomal study from 2013, with nearly 1,300 samples from all of the Brazilian regions, found a pred. degree of European ancestry combined with African and Native American contributions, in varying degrees. &#x27;Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population&#x27;.

A 2015 autosomal genetic study, which analyzed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%). The European contribution is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), the African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%) and the Native American is the highest in Northern Brazil (32%).

Not all descendants of this mixture of peoples are included in the &quot;pardo&quot; category. Since racial classifications in Brazil are based on phenotype, rather than ancestry, a large part of the self-reported white population has African and Amerindian ancestors, as well as a great part of the Black population has large European and Native American contributions. Besides skin color, there are social factors that influence the racial classifications in Brazil, such as social class, wealth, racial prejudice and stigma of being Black, Mulatto or Amerindian.

The following are the results for the different Brazilian censuses, since 1872:

==Important or famous Pardo Brazilians==

===Politics===

According to africanologist Alberto da Costa e Silva, many mixed-race politicians were perceived as white due to being part of the elite, including presidents Nilo Peçanha, Rodrigues Alves, and Washington Luís. Another president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, also had some African ancestry and described himself as &quot;slightly mulatto&quot;. He allegedly once said that he had &quot;a foot in the kitchen&quot; (a nod to 19th century Brazilian domestic slavery).

Since the end of the military dictatorship, the political participation of pardos has increased. Senator Marina Silva is a descendant of Portuguese and black African ancestors in both her maternal and paternal lines.

===Arts, entertainment and sports===

Many important names of Brazilian literature are or have been pardos. Machado de Assis, generally considered the most important Brazilian writer of fiction, was himself &quot;pardo&quot;. Other remarkable writer includes Lima Barreto (a novelist, master of satire and sarcasm, and pioneer of social criticism).

Other remarkable artists include Father José Maurício Nunes Garcia (a baroque conductor and composer), and Aleijadinho (an outstanding sculptor and architect) attained high prestige as artists.

Examples of pardos in popular music include Chiquinha Gonzaga and Lupicínio Rodrigues.

Pardos in football include Ronaldo, popularly dubbed &quot;the phenomenon&quot;, is considered by experts and fans to be one of the greatest football players of all time.

== &quot;Moreno&quot; ==
In daily usage, Brazilians use the ambiguous term &quot;moreno&quot;, a word that means &quot;dark-skinned&quot;, &quot;dark-haired&quot;, &quot;tawny&quot;, &quot;swarthy&quot;, &quot;Brown&quot; (when referring to people), &quot;suntanned&quot;. &quot;Moreno&quot; is often used as an intermediate color category, similar to &quot;pardo&quot;, but its meaning is significantly broader, including people who self-identify as black, white, yellow or Amerindian in the IBGE classification system. In a 1995 survey, 32% of the population self-identified as &quot;moreno&quot;, with a further 6% self-identifying as &quot;moreno claro&quot; (&quot;light brown&quot;), and 7% self-identified as &quot;pardo&quot;. Telles describes both classifications as &quot;biologically invalid&quot;, but sociologically significant.

== Demographics ==
=== By region ===

The Brazilian regions by percent of &quot;pardo&quot; people.

2022 data:&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /

*1) North – 67.2% of &quot;pardos&quot;
*2) Northeast – 59.6%
*3) Central-West – 52.4%
*4) Southeast – 38.7%
*5) South – 21.7%

=== By state ===

According to IBGE&#x27;s data for 2022,&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; / of the ten states with greatest percentual &quot;pardo&quot; population, five were in the North and five in the Northeast.

*1) Pará – 69.9%
*2) Amazonas – 68.8%
*3) Maranhão – 66.4%
*4) Acre – 66.3%
*5) Amapá – 65.3%
*6) Piauí – 64.8%
*7) Ceará – 64.7%
*8) Tocantins – 62.1%
*9) Sergipe – 61.6%
*10) Alagoas – 60.4%

Between 2000 and 2010, the states of Goiás, Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo, together with the Federal District moved to the group of majority nonwhite states, of which &quot;pardos&quot; are very likely to be the new majority if trends continue as they perform the greatest nonwhite group in all Brazilian states. The next to be minority-majority is probably Mato Grosso do Sul (51.78% white), followed by Rio de Janeiro (54.25% white). The four southernmost states were all &gt;70% white in the 20th century, nevertheless in the last 2010 census São Paulo turned to be almost exactly 70.0% white, and according to the contemporary demographic trends it is likely to be less than 70% now.

It should be pointed out that self-identification and ancestry do not correlate well in Brazil. A predominantly self-identified &quot;pardo&quot; state like Goiás turned out to be mostly European in ancestry according to an autosomal study from the UnB undertaken in 2008. According to that study, the ancestral composition of Goiás is 83,70% European, 13,30% African and 3,0% Native American.

In Fortaleza, for example, both &quot;whites&quot; and &quot;pardos&quot; displayed a similar ancestral composition, according to a 2011 autosomal study: a predominant degree of European ancestry (&gt;70%) was found out, with minor but important African and Native American contributions.

=== By municipality ===
IBGE&#x27;s data for 2000. Of the ten municipalities with the greatest percentual &quot;pardo&quot; population, eight were in the Northeast and two in the North.

*1) Nossa Senhora das Dores (Sergipe) – 98.16% of &quot;pardos&quot;
*2) Santo Inácio do Piauí (Piauí) – 96.90%
*3) Boa Vista do Ramos (Amazonas) – 92.40%
*4) Belágua (Maranhão) – 90.85%
*5) Itacuruba (Pernambuco) – 90.05%
*6) Monte Alegre de Sergipe (Sergipe) – 90.03%
*7) Pracuuba (Amapá) – 89.99%
*8) Ipubi (Pernambuco) – 89.93%
*9) Floresta do Piauí (Piauí) – 89.37%
*10) Pinhão (Sergipe) – 87.51%

<doc id="448570" wikidata="Q222279" url="?curid=448570" title="Bukavu">
<text>Bukavu is a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), lying at the extreme south-western edge of Lake Kivu, west of Cyangugu in Rwanda, and separated from it by the outlet of the Ruzizi River. It is the capital of the South Kivu Province and as of 2012 it had an estimated population of 806,940.

In 2021 it has an estimated urban population of 1,133,000.

== History ==

Bukavu is part of the ancient territory of Bushi Kingdom, an ethnic group of South-Kivu. It was governed by a &quot;Muluzi&quot; Nyalukemba, when the first Arabs arrived. They were traders and often trafficked in enslaved Africans; they were influential in much of Africa. 

Near the end of the 19th century, Europeans entered Bushi, and the Congo Free State attempted to colonize the large territory. &#x27;Muluzi&#x27; or &#x27;Baluzi&#x27; in the plural means &#x27;the nobleman&#x27; or &#x27;nobility&#x27; to Shi. Before the Europeans came in Bushi Kingdom, Bukavu was called &quot;Rusozi&quot;. The name Bukavu comes from the transformation of word &#x27;bu &#x27;nkafu &#x27; (farm of cows) in Mashi, the language of Bashi. 

Bukavu was established in 1901 by the Congo Free State which became the Belgian Congo in 1908. Originally named Bukavu, it was named &quot;Costermansville&quot; (in French) or &quot;Costermansstad&quot; (in Dutch) in 1927, after Vice Governor-General Paul Costermans. In 1953, the name was changed back to Bukavu. It had a prominent European population under colonial rule. They were attracted by the subtropical climate (Lake Kivu is 1,500 metres above sea level) and scenic location (Bukavu is built on five peninsulas and has been described as &quot;a green hand, dipped in the lake&quot;). Many colonial villas have gardens sloping down to the lakeshore.

By contrast, the main residential district for ordinary people, Kadutu, climbs up the hillside inland. The surrounding hills reach a height of 2,000 metres. Formerly an administrative centre for the whole of the Kivu region, the town lost some of its status as a result of the growth of Goma and the late 20th century wars that erupted in the Congo following the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.

Following those massacres, Hutu refugees and many members of the former Hutu-led government fled Rwanda, contributing to the Great Lakes refugee crisis. The refugee camps around Goma and Bukavu became a center of Hutu insurgency from the camps against the new Watutsi government of Rwanda. 

In November 1996, at the start of the First Congo War, Rwandan government forces attacked the Hutu camps and forces of the Zaire government, which had allowed the insurgency. The Rwandan government supported rebels in Zaire led by Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the Kinshasa government with their help. Later, the Rwandan government fell out with the rebels, which lead to the Second Congo War. Rwanda supported the rebel Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) against Kabila. Bukavu and the rest of Sud-Kivu was the site of sporadic fighting between rebels and government forces and their proxies, including the Mayi-Mayi, especially in 1998 and 2004.

On June 3, 2004, protestors in several Congolese cities took to the streets to demonstrate against the United Nations for failing to prevent Bukavu from falling to Rwandan-backed RCD forces led by General Laurent Nkunda. About 16,000 women were raped on a single weekend after Nkunda told his troops &quot;This city is yours for three days.&quot; Nkunda was later persuaded to fall in line with the peace accords which ended the war and re-integrate his troops with the Congolese government forces. In September 2007 he rebelled again and started attacking government troops north of Goma.

During the 2015 South Kivu earthquake, at least one policeman was killed.

The city was damaged by the 2022 Bukavu floods.

On 14 February 2025, the city was entered by M23 rebels as part of an ongoing military campaign. The group took full control over the city on 16 February.

On 28 February 2025, an explosion occurred at a rally that killed 13 people and wounded several others. The Congolese government blamed the M23 rebels for the explosions.

== Geography ==
Although not threatened by volcanoes as Goma is, Bukavu is equally in danger from a potential limnic eruption from Lake Kivu, in which vast quantities of dissolved carbon dioxide and methane could explode from the lake and threaten the lives of the 2 million people who live near the lake.

== Climate ==
Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies Bukavu&#x27;s climate as tropical savanna (&quot;Aw&quot;), although it is milder than most climates of its type due to high altitude. Bukavu sees very warm days and pleasant nights year round.

==Architecture==

The city has over 100 art deco buildings which were constructed during Belgian colonial rule and proposals have been made to preserve these so that the city can be a tourist attraction for architecture enthusiasts.

== Transport ==
Bukavu is an important transport hub and gateway to eastern DR Congo, but as a result of the wars the road network has deteriorated and highways to Goma, Kisangani and other towns have not been fully restored. As with Goma, close proximity to the paved road network of East Africa and the functioning eastern section of the Trans-African Highway to Mombasa may allow a faster recovery than other Congolese towns. Bukavu&#x27;s proximity to the Lake Tanganyika ports of Bujumbura and Kalundu-Uvira give it an additional advantage, with access on the lake to the railheads of Kigoma (linked to Dar es Salaam) and Kalemie (rail link to Katanga, in need of rehabilitation). Isolation, largely due to bad road infrastructure, has been found to be an important determinant of wealth and/or development in South Kivu.

Bukavu has numerous lakeside wharves and boat transport is used extensively in the Congolese waters of the lake in the absence of well maintained roads.

Kavumu Airport (ICAO code: FZMA, IATA code: BKY) located about 30 kilometres north is the domestic airport for Bukavu. This airport has not been renovated for many years.

== Education ==
There are many schools and universities present in Bukavu. The city also is known to be one that gives good education in D. R. Congo.

Université Catholique de Bukavu, Université Évangélique en Afrique. The Official University of Bukavu was founded in 1993.

==Parks==

Kahuzi-Biéga National Park, a World Heritage Site and one of two homes of the eastern lowland gorilla, is close to the city and can be reached from the road to Kavumu. The park headquarters at Tshivanga is located 31 km from Bukavu.

== Places of worship ==
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bukavu (Catholic Church), Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (Baptist World Alliance), Baptist Community of the Congo River (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches). The city also counts a few mosques.

==Medical care==
The city is home to the Panzi Hospital. Founded by the Swedish Pentecostal Mission in 1921, its director Denis Mukwege operates on women who survive sexual violence, and is one of two doctors in the eastern Congo qualified to perform a reconstructive surgery.

Panzi Hospital is a teaching hospital of the Evangelical University in Africa. Bukavu is also home to the Catholic University of Bukavu&#x27;s School of Medicine and General Reference teaching hospital. The pharmaceutical factory Pharmakina owned by a German immigrant and a French immigrant produces the antimalarial drug quinine and the generic AIDS medicament Afri-vir. Pharmakina also runs an AIDS diagnostic and treatment center. With 740 employees and about 1000 free-lance workers. After Great Lake Plantations SARL, which is Congo&#x27;s only modern tea manufacturing company, Pharmakina is the largest employer in town.

==Social issues==
Women continue to face major problems of violence in the wake of war in the eastern DRC. Fondation Chirezi in August 2007 launched a project based in Bukavu for women&#x27;s trauma healing and care.

Another NGO launched a program to help women affected by Violence in Panzi next to Fondation Panzi called V-Day.

After the repeated wars in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the number of people wounded by the war and living with disabilities has increased considerably. A national non-profit association called Congo Handicap was created in 2004 in Bukavu to support people living with disabilities. It provides comprehensive care for this segment of the population, including people living with disabilities who were raped during the war.

<text>HMS &quot;Norfolk was a British [[Type 23 frigate]], the sixth in the [[Royal Navy]] to use this name, laid down in 1985 by [[Yarrow Shipbuilders]]. She was launched on the [[River Clyde|Clyde]] by [[Princess Margaret|Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]] in July 1987 and named for the [[Duke of Norfolk|Dukedom of Norfolk]]. She was commissioned on 1 June 1990. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was the &#x27;first of class&#x27;, as well as being the first of a new generation of &#x27;lean manned&#x27; ships. She was commissioned into the Chilean Navy in 2006 as Almirante Cochrane&quot;.

==Operational history==
===Royal Navy===
Following commissioning in 1990, HMS &quot;Norfolk&quot; completed a year on first of class trials culminating in BOST in November/December 1991. 1992 started with JMC following by a brief defect rectification period in early March. On 11 May, &quot;Norfolk&quot; deployed as part of the Orient 92 Task Group with (Flag), and . During her deployment she completed visits to the Eastern Med (Soudha in Crete, Alexandria in Egypt, Haifa in Israel), Mauritius and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, Malaysia (Lumut, Penang, Pulau Tioman), Thailand (Bangkok), South Korea (Pusan) and Hong Kong in the Far East and Oman in the Middle East. She returned to the UK at the end November 1992.

In January 1993, &quot;Norfolk&quot; continued with first of class shock trials in Portsmouth before completing accommodation changes being the first Type 23 to host Wren ratings at sea. This was completed in June 1993 followed by a brief trip to Amsterdam, BOST and preparation for her Southlant deployment in 1994. In 1994, &quot;Norfolk&quot; became the first Royal Navy warship to visit South Africa in over 20 years, a visit designed to show that the Commonwealth was ready to accept South Africa as an ally resulting from the abolition of apartheid. Since then, she has conducted many operations, including a deployment to Sierra Leone in 2000 as part of a Royal Navy task force to assist in restoration of peace and stability to the war-torn West African nation. 2000 was a busy year for &quot;Norfolk&quot; with a deployment under Commander Bruce Williams to the United States. Amongst the places visited were Savannah, Wilmington, Port Canaveral and Nassau. She has also served in the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, as well as being involved in Standing Naval Force Atlantic. Other duties included acting as guardship for the Falkland Islands, as well as the Caribbean.

A chance encounter in 2000 attracted a local bottlenose dolphin whilst on exercises. A photograph of the encounter was taken and the dolphin, frequently seen in the area, was named Norfolk in honour of this encounter.

====2001–2005====
2002 saw a busy year for &quot;Norfolk&quot;, commanded by Commander Richard Talbot. She was deployed with vessels from Portugal, Norway, Spain, Germany, Italy and the United States of America as part of her role within the Standing Naval Force Atlantic (SNFL). As part of SNFL she was involved in a simulated volcanic eruption disaster relief exercise. March saw Exercise &#x27;Strong Resolve&#x27; off Northern Norway, then in April she was in the Mediterranean as part of Operation Direct Endeavour for NATO. During the Mediterranean deployment there was a visit to Malta, including hosting the Princess Royal, for the celebration of the anniversary of the award of the George Cross to the island. The voyage was also the last for Mr Chick MBE, a laundryman who served for 50 years including the Yangtze Incident, Korea and Suez through to the Falklands Campaign and Gulf War. &quot;Norfolk&quot; then attended the 2002 Navy days at Devonport. 2002/2003 saw the crew of &quot;Norfolk&quot; deployed with &#x27;Green Goddess&#x27; fire engines to compensate for the fire service strike. &quot;Norfolk&quot; spent 169 days alongside the wall at HMNB Portsmouth. May 2003 saw &quot;Norfolk&quot; sail to her home base of Devonport and resume her active role, training ready for her deployment to the Gulf on Operation Telic 1/2. Amongst the simulations were attack runs by small attack craft, similar to the one which attacked .

&quot;Norfolk&quot; was the first ship to be armed with the Vertical Launch Seawolf missile system. &quot;Norfolk&quot; was also the first Royal Navy warship to be re-armed with the new 4.5–inch (114 mm) Mod 1 gun system. 2004 saw &quot;Norfolk&quot; involved in the celebrations of the centenary of the Entente Cordiale with France. &quot;Norfolk&quot; also took part in the 2004 amphibious warfare-themed Devonport Navy days. In July 2004, it was announced that &quot;Norfolk&quot; would be one of three Type 23 frigates decommissioned by the end of 2007. &quot;Norfolk&quot; entered her home port for the last time at the end of November 2004 was decommissioned at Devonport on 15 April 2005, the guest of honour being then Commander-in-Chief Fleet, Admiral Sir Jonathon Band, who had been &quot;Norfolk&quot;″s first commanding officer.

===Chilean Navy ===

In June 2005 it was announced that &quot;Norfolk&quot; would be sold to the Chilean Navy. She was commissioned into the Chilean Navy on 22 November 2006 as &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; (named after Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald).

Along with other Chilean vessels of her class, &quot;Almirante Cochrane&quot; underwent a significant upgrade from March 2018 to November 2019. The CMS 330 combat management architecture was installed along TRS-4D G-Band active scanning radars and 32 CAMM Sea Ceptor vertical-launch surface-to-air missile silos to replace the previous Sea Wolf SAM system.

<doc id="448579" wikidata="Q1278485" url="?curid=448579" title="Verginia">
<text>Verginia, or Virginia (c. 465 BC449 BC), was the subject of an ancient Roman story recounted in Roman historian Livy&#x27;s text &quot;Ab Urbe Condita&quot;. Upon a threat to her virtue, Verginia was killed by her father Verginius. Livy directly links Verginia&#x27;s death to the overthrow of the decemviri and the re-establishment of the Roman Republic.

== The story of Verginia ==
In 451 BC, the decemvir Appius Claudius began to lust after Verginia, a beautiful plebeian girl who was the daughter of Lucius Verginius, a respected centurion. Verginia was betrothed to Lucius Icilius, a former tribune of the plebs. When Verginia rejected Claudius&#x27; advances, he had one of his clients, Marcus Claudius, claim that she was not the daughter of Verginius but instead the daughter of his slave, and therefore a slave herself. Marcus Claudius then abducted her while she was on her way to school in the Forum, taking advantage of her father&#x27;s absence from Rome. The crowd in the Forum objected to this, as both Verginius and Icilius were well-respected men, and they forced Marcus Claudius to bring the case before the decemvirs. However, the case was to be presided over by Appius Claudius himself. Verginius was recalled from the field to defend his daughter. Icilius, after threats of violence, succeeded in having Verginia returned to her house while the court waited for her father to appear. Claudius tried to have his own supporters intercept the messengers sent to summon Verginius, but they arrived too late to delay Verginius&#x27; arrival.

When Verginius arrived two days later, he gathered his supporters in the Forum. Claudius, unmoved by Verginius&#x27; widespread support, would not let him speak or defend himself, and declared that Verginia was indeed Marcus Claudius&#x27; slave. Additionally, Claudius had brought an armed escort with him and accused the citizens of sedition, and the supporters of Verginius left the Forum rather than cause any violence. Verginius begged Claudius to question his daughter himself, which Claudius agreed to. However, Verginius grabbed a knife and, at the Shrine of Venus Cloacina, he stabbed Verginia, the only way he felt he could uphold her freedom and virtue. Upon killing her, Livy claims that Verginius spoke to Claudius directly, yelling: &quot;By this blood, Appius, I devote thy head to the infernal gods.&quot; Verginius and Icilius were arrested, but their supporters, angered by Claudius&#x27; actions, returned to attack the lictors and destroy their fasces. The pair was then released. Claudius was eventually jailed but he committed suicide before his trial. Marcus Claudius was tried, found guilty, and exiled to Tibur. This controversy led to the overthrow of the decemviri and the re-establishment of the Roman Republic.

== References to Verginia in Literature ==
Livy compared the story of Verginia&#x27;s death to the rape of Lucretia, whose death led to the overthrow of the Roman monarchy in 509 BC. Modern historians view the stories of Roman women such as Verginia and Lucretia as supporting traditional Roman values through the women&#x27;s displays of feminine virtue and symbolization of criticisms against the tyrannical Roman government. The people of Rome were already angry with the decemviri for not calling the proper elections, taking bribes, and other abuses after taking power within the Roman government and the story of Verginia attested to this discontent.

The tale is retold, with varying fidelity, in several works of Western literature. Among these are Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Physician&#x27;s Tale&quot; in his &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, Thomas Babington Macaulay&#x27;s &quot;Lays of Ancient Rome&quot;, Jean de Meun&#x27;s poem &quot;Roman de la Rose&quot;, and the play &quot;Appius and Virginia&quot; by John Webster and Thomas Heywood. Verginia is additionally mentioned in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and her story is retold in Steven Saylor&#x27;s &quot;Roma&quot;.

<doc id="448584" wikidata="Q963129" url="?curid=448584" title="Lawrence Taylor">
<text>Lawrence Julius Taylor (born February 4, 1959), nicknamed &quot;L.T.&quot;, is an American former professional football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons with the New York Giants. He is almost consensually regarded as the greatest defensive player of all time.

After an All-American career at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (1978–1981), Taylor was selected by the Giants second overall in the 1981 NFL draft. Although controversy surrounded the selection due to Taylor&#x27;s contract demands, the two sides quickly resolved the issue. Taylor was named both the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year in 1981 and the only NFL player to win the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in his rookie season. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Taylor was a disruptive force at outside linebacker, and is credited with changing defensive game plans, defensive pass rushing schemes, offensive line blocking schemes, and offensive formations used in the NFL. Taylor produced double-digit sacks each season from 1984 through 1990, including a career-high of 20.5 in 1986. He also won a record three AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards (since tied by J. J. Watt and Aaron Donald), and was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) for his performance during the 1986 season. He and Alan Page (1971) are the only defensive players in league history to earn the award. Taylor was named First-team All-Pro in eight of his first ten seasons, and Second-team All-Pro in the other two. Taylor was a key member of the Giants&#x27; defense, nicknamed the &quot;Big Blue Wrecking Crew&quot;, that led New York to victories in Super Bowls XXI and XXV. During the 1980s Taylor, Carl Banks, Gary Reasons, Brad Van Pelt, Brian Kelley, Pepper Johnson, and Hall of Famer Harry Carson earned the Giants linebacking corps a reputation as one of the best in the NFL, along with the nickname &quot;Crunch Bunch&quot;.

Taylor has lived a controversial lifestyle, during and after his playing career. He was known for his on-game persona and at one point inadvertently caused a compound fracture of the right leg of quarterback Joe Theismann. He admitted to using drugs such as cocaine as early as his second year in the NFL, and was suspended for 30 days in 1988 by the league for failing drug tests. His drug abuse escalated after his retirement, and he was jailed three times for attempted drug possession. From 1998 to 2009, Taylor claims to have lived a sober, drug-free life. He worked as a color commentator on sporting events after his retirement, and pursued a career as an actor. His personal life came under public scrutiny in 2010 when he was arrested for the statutory rape of a 16-year-old girl. After he pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute, Taylor was registered as a low-risk sex offender.

==Early life==
Taylor was the first of three sons born to Clarence and Iris Taylor in Williamsburg, Virginia. His father worked as a dispatcher at the Newport News shipyards, while his mother was a schoolteacher. Referred to as Lonnie by his family, Taylor was a mischievous youth. His mother said that &quot;[h]e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie ... would just do it, and when you found out about it, he would give you a big story.&quot; Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, playing catcher, and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen. He did not play organized high school football until the following year (eleventh grade), and was not heavily recruited coming out of high school.

==College career==
After graduating from Lafayette High School in 1977, Taylor attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where he was a team captain, and wore No. 98. Originally recruited as a defensive lineman, Taylor switched to linebacker before the 1979 season. He had 16 sacks in his final year there (1980), and set numerous defensive records. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American and the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in 1980. The coaching staff marveled at his intense, reckless style of play. &quot;As a freshman playing on special teams, he&#x27;d jump a good six or seven feet in the air to block a punt, then land on the back of his neck&quot;, said North Carolina assistant coach Bobby Cale. &quot;He was reckless, just reckless.&quot; UNC later retired Taylor&#x27;s jersey.

==Professional career==

===1981 NFL draft and training camp===

In the 1981 NFL draft, Taylor was selected by the New York Giants in the first round as the 2nd pick overall. In a poll of NFL general managers (GMs) taken before the draft 26 of the league&#x27;s 28 GMs said if they had the first selection they would select Taylor. One of the two GMs who said they would not take Taylor was Bum Phillips, who had just been hired as coach and general manager by the New Orleans Saints. As fate would have it for Taylor, the Saints were also the team who had the first pick in the draft. Giants GM George Young predicted before the draft that he would be better than NFL legends such as Dick Butkus: &quot;Taylor is the best college linebacker I&#x27;ve ever seen. Sure, I saw Dick Butkus play. There&#x27;s no doubt in my mind about Taylor. He&#x27;s bigger and stronger than Butkus was. On the blitz, he&#x27;s devastating.&quot;

On draft day, Phillips made good on his promise not to draft Taylor and the Saints instead selected Heisman Trophy-winning halfback George Rogers with the first pick, leaving the Giants with the decision of whether to select Taylor. To the raucous approval of the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York City), the Giants selected him. Privately, Taylor was hesitant about playing for New York as he had hoped to be drafted by the Dallas Cowboys, and was unimpressed with a tour of Giants Stadium he was taken on, after the draft. Publicly, however, he expressed excitement about the opportunity to play in the city. Taylor changed his stance after he was drafted as Harry Carson made a point to reach out to him, and Taylor said he &quot;talked to some players and coaches&quot; and &quot;got things straightened out.&quot; One of the factors that the Giants said they considered in selecting Taylor was his solid reputation. &quot;He was the cleanest player in the draft. By that I mean there was no rap on him&quot;, said head coach Ray Perkins. &quot;Great potential as a linebacker, a fine young man, free of injuries.&quot; Taylor chose to wear number 56 because he was a fan of Cowboys linebacker Thomas Henderson. As it would turn out, Taylor would have a longer and more successful career than Rogers, who had several 1,000-yard rushing seasons and made two Pro Bowl teams but was injury-prone and forced to retire after just seven seasons in 1987.

Taylor&#x27;s talent was evident from the start of training camp. Reports came out of the Giants training compound of the exploits of the new . Taylor&#x27;s teammates took to calling him Superman and joked that his locker should be replaced with a phone booth. Phil Simms, the team&#x27;s quarterback, said, &quot;on the pass rush, he&#x27;s an animal. He&#x27;s either going to run around you or over you. With his quickness, he&#x27;s full speed after two steps.&quot; Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants&#x27; 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after facing him in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, &quot;[h]e dang-near killed me, I just kept saying, &#x27;Who is this guy?&#x27; He kept coming from my blind side and just ripped my ribs to pieces.&quot;

Taylor developed what has been described as a &quot;love-hate relationship&quot; with Bill Parcells, the Giants’ defensive coordinator when he was drafted and later their head coach. Parcells often rode players in the hopes of driving them to better performance. Taylor did not appreciate this approach, and early on told Parcells, &quot;I&#x27;ve had enough. You either cut me or trade me but get the fuck off my back.&quot; Parcells kept on Taylor, but privately told some veterans, &quot;I like that LT. That motherfucker&#x27;s got a mean streak.&quot;

===Early career: 1981–1985===
Taylor made his NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from incurring a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when he was supposed to drop into coverage. When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded &quot;Well, we better put it in on Monday, because that play&#x27;s a dandy.&quot; He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season is considered one of the best in NFL history. He was named 1981&#x27;s NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. Taylor&#x27;s arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team&#x27;s best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team&#x27;s trainer he would be surprised if the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor&#x27;s life for $2 million.

The 1982 NFL season, which was shortened to nine regular season games by a players strike, included one of the more memorable plays of Taylor&#x27;s career. In the nationally televised Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, the teams were tied 6–6 early in the fourth quarter, when the Lions drove deep into New York territory. Lions quarterback Gary Danielson dropped back to pass and threw the ball out to his left toward the sidelines. Taylor ran in front of the intended receiver, intercepted the pass, and returned it 97 yards for a touchdown. This play was indicative of Taylor&#x27;s unusual combination, even for a linebacker, of power with speed. He was again named Defensive Player of the Year.

After the 1982 season, Perkins became head coach of the University of Alabama and the Giants hired Parcells to replace him. In the coming years this change proved crucial to the Giants and Taylor. Leading up to the 1983 season, Taylor engaged in a training camp holdout that lasted three weeks and ended when he came back to the team under his old contract with three games left in the preseason.

Although Taylor recorded nine sacks and made the All-Pro team for the third consecutive season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him fewer pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Despite this change, Taylor made the 1983 All-Pro Team at both outside linebacker and inside linebacker, becoming the first first-team All-Pro in NFL History selected for two positions in the same year. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year, $6.55 million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2 million contract.

The Giants&#x27; record rebounded to 9–7 in 1984, and Taylor had his fourth All-Pro season. He got off to a quick start, recording four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16–13, but lost 21–10 to the eventual champion 49ers.

In contrast to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season with a sense of optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Redskins, Taylor&#x27;s sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann&#x27;s right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann&#x27;s career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During the first round of the playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.

===Mid-career and championships: 1986–1990===
In 1986, Taylor had one of the most successful seasons by a defensive player in the history of the NFL. He recorded a league-leading 20.5 sacks and became one of just two defensive players to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award and the only defensive player to be the unanimous selection for MVP. He also was named Defensive Player of the Year for the third time. The Giants finished the season 14–2 and outscored San Francisco and Washington by a combined score of 66–3 in the NFC playoffs. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; alone the week leading up to Super Bowl XXI with a warning from the magazine to the Denver Broncos regarding Taylor. The Giants overcame a slow start in Super Bowl XXI to defeat Denver 39–20. Taylor made a key touchdown preventing tackle on a goal line play in the first half, stopping Broncos quarterback John Elway as he sprinted out on a rollout.

With the Super Bowl win, Taylor capped off an unprecedented start to his career. After six years, he had been named the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award (1981), NFL Defensive Player of the Year a record three times (1981, 1982, 1986), First-team All-Pro six times, become the first defensive player in NFL history unanimously voted the league&#x27;s MVP (1986), and led his team to a championship (1986). After the win, however, Taylor felt let down rather than elated. Taylor said:

The Giants appeared to have a bright future coming off their 1986 championship season as they were one of the younger teams in the league. They struggled the next season however, falling to 6–9 in the strike-shortened 1987 season. Taylor caused strife in the locker room when he broke the picket line after early struggles by the team. He explained his decision by saying &quot;The Giants are losing. And I&#x27;m losing $60,000 a week.&quot; He finished the season as the team leader in sacks with 12 in 12 games played, but missed a game due to a hamstring injury, ending his consecutive games played streak at 106.

The Giants looked to rebound to their championship ways in 1988 but the start of the season was marred by controversy surrounding Taylor. He tested positive for cocaine and was suspended by the league for thirty days, as it was his second violation of the NFL&#x27;s substance abuse policy. The first result in 1987 had been kept private and was not known to the public at the time. He was kept away from the press during this period and checked himself into rehab in early September. Taylor&#x27;s over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. This was especially true given the eventual career paths of talented players like Hollywood Henderson and others whose drug problems derailed their careers. The Giants went 2–2 in the games Taylor missed. When Taylor returned he was his usual dominant self as he led the team in sacks again, with 15.5 in 12 games played. The season also contained some of the more memorable moments of Taylor&#x27;s career. In a crucial late-season game with playoff implications against the New Orleans Saints, Taylor played through a torn pectoral muscle to record seven tackles, three sacks, and two forced fumbles. Taylor&#x27;s presence in the lineup was important as the Giants&#x27; offense was having trouble mounting drives, and was dominated in time of possession. Television cameras repeatedly cut to the sidelines to show him in extreme physical pain as he was being attended to by the Giants staff. Taylor had already developed a reputation for playing through pain; in a 1983 game against the Eagles the team&#x27;s training staff had to hide his helmet to prevent the injured Taylor from returning to the field. Taylor&#x27;s shoulder was so injured that he had to wear a harness to keep it in its place. The Giants held on for a 13–12 win, and Parcells later called Taylor&#x27;s performance &quot;[t]he greatest game I ever saw.&quot; However, the Giants narrowly missed the playoffs in 1988 at 10–6 by losing tie-breakers with the Eagles in their division and the Rams for the Wild card.

In 1989, Taylor recorded 15 sacks. He was forced to play the latter portion of the season with a fractured tibia, suffered in a 34–24 loss to the 49ers in week 12, which caused him to sit out the second half of several games. Despite his off-the-field problems, Taylor remained popular among his teammates and was voted defensive co-captain along with Carl Banks. The two filled the defensive captain&#x27;s spot vacated by the retired Harry Carson. The retirement of the nine-time Pro Bowler Carson, broke up the Giants linebacker corps of Carson, Reasons, Banks, and Taylor, which spearheaded the team&#x27;s defense nicknamed the &quot;Big Blue Wrecking Crew&quot; in the 1980s. The Giants went 12–4, and advanced to the playoffs. In an exciting, down-to-the-wire game, the Rams eliminated the Giants 19–13 in the first round, despite Taylor&#x27;s two sacks and one forced fumble.

Taylor held out of training camp before the 1990 season, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks dragged into September with neither side budging, and as the season approached Taylor received fines at the rate of $2,500 a day. He signed a three-year $5 million contract (making him the highest paid defensive player in the league) just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out training camp and the preseason, Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble against the Eagles. He finished with 10.5 sacks and earned his 10th Pro Bowl in as many years, although the season marked the first time in Taylor&#x27;s career that he was not selected First-team All-Pro. The Giants started out 10–0 and finished with a 13–3 record. In the playoffs, the Giants defeated the Bears 31–3, and faced the rival 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. The Giants won 15–13, after Taylor beat two successive blocks by 49ers tight end Brent Jones and fullback Tom Rathman to get into the 49ers offensive backfield to be in position to recover a key fumble by Roger Craig forced by nose tackle Erik Howard late in the game to set up Matt Bahr&#x27;s game-winning field goal. In Super Bowl XXV, they played the Buffalo Bills and won one of the more entertaining Super Bowls in history, 20-19, after Buffalo&#x27;s Scott Norwood missed a potential game-winning field goal in the closing seconds of the game.

===Final years and decline: 1991–1993===
Following the 1990 season, Parcells, with whom Taylor had become very close, retired, and the team was taken over by Ray Handley. 1991 marked a steep decline in Taylor&#x27;s production. It became the first season in his career in which he failed to make the Pro Bowl squad, after setting a then record by making it in his first ten years in the league. Taylor finished with 7 sacks in 14 games and the Giants defense, while still respectable, was no longer one of the top units in the league.

Taylor rebounded in the early stages of what many thought would be his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games, Taylor was on pace for 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992, against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting he wanted a longer-term contract.

Taylor returned for the 1993 season enticed by the chance to play with a new coach (Dan Reeves), and determined not to end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Minnesota Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994, in what would be Taylor&#x27;s final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the San Francisco 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s time for me to retire. I&#x27;ve done everything I can do. I&#x27;ve been to Super Bowls. I&#x27;ve been to playoffs. I&#x27;ve done things that other people haven&#x27;t been able to do in this game before. After 13 years, it&#x27;s time for me to go.&quot;

Taylor ended his career with 1,089 tackles, 132.5 sacks (plus 9.5 tallied as a rookie before the stat was officially recognized), nine interceptions, 134 return yards, two touchdowns, 33 forced fumbles, 11 fumble recoveries, and 34 fumble return yards.

==Legacy==
Taylor is considered one of the best players to ever play in the NFL, and has been ranked as the top defensive player in league history by some news outlets, media members, former players and coaches. He has also been described as one of the most &quot;feared&quot; and &quot;intimidating&quot; players in NFL history. Taylor&#x27;s explosive speed and power is credited with changing the outside linebacker position from one of &quot;read and react&quot; to aggression and attack.

Washington Redskins head coach Joe Gibbs developed the two tight end offense and the position of H-back to prevent Taylor from blitzing into the backfield unhindered. &quot;We had to try in some way have a special game plan just for Lawrence Taylor. Now you didn&#x27;t do that very often in this league but I think he&#x27;s one person that we learned the lesson the hard way. We lost ball games.&quot; His skills changed the way offensive coaches blocked linebackers. In the late &#x27;70s and early &#x27;80s, a blitzing linebacker was picked up by a running back. However, these players were no match for Taylor. The tactic employed by San Francisco 49ers head coach Bill Walsh in the 1982 playoffs, using an offensive guard to block Taylor, was copied around the league. However, this left a hole in pass protection that a blitzing middle linebacker could exploit. Later, Walsh and other coaches began using offensive tackles to block Taylor. Later it became common for offensive linemen to pick up blitzing linebackers. In addition to the changes in offensive schemes Taylor influenced, he also introduced new defensive techniques to the game, such as chopping the ball out of a quarterback&#x27;s hands (to potentially force a more valuable turnover) rather than simply tackling him for a loss. This exemplified a team-first strategy that dampened Taylor’s sack totals while increasing the prospects of Giants success.

==Drug and lifestyle problems==

Taylor began using illicit drugs during his professional rookie season, 1981–1982. He would pass the NFL&#x27;s drug tests, however, by routinely obtaining his teammates&#x27; urine to submit as his own urine samples.

As his drug habit escalated, he would spend up to thousands of dollars a day on &quot;coke and women.&quot; His first wife, Linda, once had to pick him up from a crack house. And he once attended a team meeting still handcuffed from the night before by some &quot;ladies that were trying out some new equipment&quot;, but &quot;just didn&#x27;t happen to have the key&quot;, he would recall.

In 1987, he finally tested positive for cocaine, and admitted to using it. The next year, 1988, he failed a second drug test, whereupon the NFL suspended him for 30 days. With that, he abstained from drugs until his 1993 retirement, as a third failed drug test would end his career. Yet he would later recall that in retiring, &quot;I saw blow as the only bright spot in my future.&quot;

During 1995, he went through drug rehab twice. But over the next three years, he was arrested twice, via undercover police officers, for attempts to buy cocaine. Meanwhile, he associated mainly with drug users, and his home usually had white sheets over its windows. &quot;I had gotten really bad. I mean my place was almost like a crack house,&quot; Taylor would later explain.

==Post-NFL life==

===Investments===
In Taylor&#x27;s final year in the NFL, he started a company called All-Pro Products. The company went public at $5 a share, and tripled in value during its first month. The stock price reached $16.50 a share, at which point Taylor&#x27;s stake had an estimated value of over $10 million. The company ceased production shortly thereafter however, and Taylor, who never sold his stock, lost several hundred thousand dollars. He had been defrauded by several members of the penny stock firm Hanover Sterling &amp; Company, who had short sold the company&#x27;s stock, making it worthless. The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that two traders had manipulated the price of the stock, which skyrocketed while the company was losing over $900,000.

===Tax issues===
In 1997 Taylor pleaded guilty to filing a false tax return in 1990, and in 2000 he was &quot;sentenced to three months of house arrest, five years of probation, and 500 hours of community service for tax evasion.&quot; 
===Television pundit===
After his career ended, Taylor worked in several regular television jobs. He first worked as a football analyst for the now defunct &quot;TNT Sunday Night Football&quot;. In a one-off show, Taylor also appeared as a wrestler in the World Wrestling Federation, defeating Bam Bam Bigelow in the main event of WrestleMania XI. He also worked as a color commentator on an amateur fighting program entitled &quot;Toughman&quot; on the FX channel. On September 4, 1995, the Giants retired Phil Simms&#x27; jersey during halftime of a game against the Cowboys (Taylor had his number retired the year before). Simms celebrated the moment by throwing an impromptu ceremonial pass to Taylor. Simms recalled, &quot;[a]ll of a sudden it kind of hit me, I&#x27;ve put Lawrence in a really tough spot; national TV, he&#x27;s got dress shoes and a sports jacket on, and he&#x27;s had a few beers and he&#x27;s going to run down the field and I&#x27;m going to throw him a pass.&quot; Simms motioned for Taylor to run a long pattern and after 30–40 yards threw him the pass. Taylor later said the situation made him more nervous than any play of his career, &quot;I&#x27;m saying to myself (as the pass is being thrown), &#x27;If I drop this pass, I got to run my black ass all the way back to Upper Saddle River because there ain&#x27;t no way I&#x27;m going to be able to stay in that stadium&#x27;.&quot; Taylor caught the pass, however, and the capacity crowd in attendance cheered in approval.

===Movies &amp; video games===
Taylor pursued a career in acting, appearing in the Oliver Stone movie &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot; where he played a character much like himself. He appeared as himself in the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and the film &quot;The Waterboy&quot;. He also had a role in the 2000 version of &quot;Shaft&quot;. Taylor voiced the steroid-riddled, possibly insane former football player B.J. Smith in the video game, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. The character poked fun at his fearsome, drug-fueled public image. He also added his voice to the video game &quot;&quot; and , which were partially based on his life in the NFL. He also acted in the 2000 Christian film &quot;Mercy Streets&quot; with Eric Roberts and Stacy Keach, and the 2003 prison movie &quot;In Hell&quot; with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

===Hall of Fame induction===
In 1999, when Taylor became eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, there were some concerns his hard-partying lifestyle and drug abuse would hurt his candidacy. These concerns proved to be ill-founded, however, as he was voted in on the first ballot. His son Lawrence Taylor Jr. gave his introduction speech at the induction ceremony. Taylor&#x27;s ex-wife, his three children, and his parents were in attendance and during his induction speech Taylor acknowledged them saying, &quot;thank you for putting up with me for all those years.&quot; He also credited former Giants owner Wellington Mara for being supportive of him saying, &quot;[h]e probably cared more about me as a person than he really should have.&quot;

===Autobiography===
In 2004 Taylor released an autobiography, &quot;LT: Over the Edge&quot;. Taylor often spoke of his NFL years, which he played with reckless abandon, and the drug-abusing stages of his life as the &quot;L.T.&quot; periods of his life. He described &quot;L.T.&quot; as an adrenaline junkie who lived life on a thrill ride. Taylor said in 2003 that &quot;L. T. died a long time ago, and I don&#x27;t miss him at all ... all that&#x27;s left is Lawrence Taylor.&quot;

===Advertising and television===

Taylor re-emerged into the public eye in July 2006, after appearing on the cover of a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; issue dedicated to former athletes and sport figures. In the magazine, Taylor credited his hobby of golf with helping him get over his previous hard-partying ways and drug filled lifestyle. He co-founded eXfuze, a network marketing company based in West Palm Beach, Florida. Along with former NFL players, such as Eric Dickerson and Seth Joyner, he was a spokesman for Seven+, the flagship multi-botanical drink produced by the company. His son Brandon signed a national letter to play with the Purdue Boilermakers. Taylor was a contestant on the 8th season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with Edyta Śliwińska. He was eliminated in the seventh week on the April 21, 2009, show.

===Legal troubles===
In 2009, Taylor started having troubles in his personal life again. On November 8, he was arrested in Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a one-car accident and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000.

In May 2010, Taylor was arrested for statutory rape of a 16-year-old girl, at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl told investigators that her pimp commanded her to tell Taylor that she was 19, which Taylor corroborated. The pimp, 36-year old Rasheed Davis, was charged with federal child sex trafficking. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011. Taylor was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He also registered as a low-risk, level-one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim&#x27;s claims that Taylor assaulted her.

As of 2016, Taylor resides in Pembroke Pines, Florida. On June 9, 2016, Taylor&#x27;s wife was arrested for domestic violence in Florida after she threw &quot;an unknown object&quot; and struck Taylor in the back of the head. By 2021, Taylor was once again divorced.

In May 2017, Taylor put up for auction the Vince Lombardi mini statue he had won for the Super Bowl XXV win. The next month, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol following a September 2, 2016, crash into a stopped police car in Palm Beach County, Florida. The two breathalyzer tests taken five hours after the crash measured Taylor&#x27;s blood-alcohol level at .082 and .084, above the Florida legal limit of .080.

In December 2021, Taylor was arrested after again to failing to report his new address, which was required due to his status as a registered sex offender. He would be released shortly afterwards after posting a $500 bail. Taylor blamed his recent divorce for not updating authorities about the 2021 address change. In July 2024, Taylor was arrested in Florida after once again failing to report a new residency, which again resulted in Taylor avoiding to properly register as a sex offender. After turning himself in, Taylor would be released with no bail after spending several hours in the main Broward County jail. For this second offense, Taylor would be criminally charged. Taylor&#x27;s attorney has stated that Taylor would plead not guilty, describing the incident as a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; rather than a criminal offense.

<doc id="448587" wikidata="Q5102127" url="?curid=448587" title="Chislic">
<text>Chislic (or sometimes chislick) is a dish consisting of skewered cubes of red meat, usually mutton or lamb, although game meats such as venison and even beef steak can be used. 
Most commonly associated with the state of South Dakota, chislic was declared the official state &quot;nosh&quot; of South Dakota in March 2018.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;chislic&quot; is arguably derived from the Turkic word &quot;shashlik&quot; or &quot;shashlyk&quot;, itself rooted in &quot;shish kebab&quot;, the Turkish term for skewered meats. Chislic may have been introduced into the United States by John Hoellwarth, who immigrated from the Crimea to Hutchinson County, South Dakota, in the 1870s.

The dish may have been introduced to South Dakota by Hoellwarth, but is highly unlikely to have been the introduction to the US. Both Greek and Armenian subjects of the Ottoman Empire came to the US in the 17th,18th and 19th centuries, and even Martin the Armenian, a tobacco farmer in the original Jamestown colony. They would have brought their common food preparation ideas with them.

== Preparation ==
Chislic consists of deep-fried cubes of mutton, lamb, beef or venison prepared rare to medium-rare, sprinkled with garlic salt or other seasoned salt, and served with toothpicks. The dish is typically served hot, accompanied by soda crackers. Regional variations exist: in Pierre, the meat is battered; in Sioux Falls, it is lightly dusted with flour before deep-frying and may be served with hot sauce; near Watertown, ranch dressing may be served on the side; while Lawry&#x27;s Seasoned Salt is preferred near Redfield.

<text>Didn&#x27;t They Do Well is a short-lived BBC television quiz show presented by Bruce Forsyth that ran from 15 January to 18 March 2004. It consisted of archive television clips, many of which were from previous quiz show episodes, in which modern day contestants were shown a question and then asked to answer it. Its title was one of Forsyth&#x27;s catchphrases when hosting &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in the 1970s and again in the 1990s.

<doc id="448592" wikidata="Q5539" url="?curid=448592" title="Great Slave Lake">
<text>Great Slave Lake is the second-largest lake in the Northwest Territories, Canada (after Great Bear Lake), the deepest lake in North America at , and the tenth-largest lake in the world by area. It is long and wide. It covers an area of in the southern part of the territory. Its given volume ranges from to and up to making it the 10th or 12th largest by volume.

The lake shares its name with the First Nations peoples of the Dene family called Slavey by their enemies the Cree. Towns situated on the lake include (clockwise from east) Łutselk&#x27;e, Fort Resolution, Hay River, Hay River Reserve, Behchokǫ̀, Yellowknife, Ndilǫ, and Dettah. The only community in the East Arm is Łutselk&#x27;e, a hamlet of about 350 people, largely Chipewyan Indigenous peoples of the Dene Nation, and the abandoned winter camp and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post Fort Reliance. Along the south shore, east of Hay River is the abandoned Pine Point Mine and the company town of Pine Point.

==History==
Indigenous peoples were the first settlers around the lake after the retreat of glacial ice. Archaeological evidence has revealed several different periods of cultural history, including the Northern Plano tradition (8,000 years before present), Shield Archaic tradition (6,500 years), Arctic small tool tradition (3,500 years), and the Taltheilei Shale tradition (2,500 years before present). Each culture has left a distinct mark in the archaeological record based on type or size of lithic tools.

Great Slave Lake was put on European maps during the emergence of the fur trade towards the northwest from Hudson Bay in the mid 18th century. The name &#x27;Great Slave&#x27; came from the English-language translation of the Cree exonym, &quot;Awokanek&quot; (Slavey), which they called the Dene Tha. The Slavey people were Dene tribes living on the lake&#x27;s southern shores at that time. As the French explorers dealt directly with the Cree traders, the large lake was referred to as &quot;Grand lac des Esclaves&quot; which was eventually translated into English as &quot;Great Slave Lake&quot;.

In the 1930s, gold was discovered on the North Arm of Great Slave Lake. This discovery led to the establishment of Yellowknife, which would become the capital of the NWT. In 1960, an all-season highway was built around the west side of the lake; the highway was originally an extension of the Mackenzie Highway, but became known as Yellowknife Highway or Highway 3. 

On January 24, 1978, a Soviet Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite named Kosmos 954, which contained an onboard nuclear reactor, fell from orbit and disintegrated. Pieces of the nuclear core fell in the vicinity of Great Slave Lake. Some of the nuclear debris was recovered by a joint Canadian Armed Forces and United States Armed Forces military operation called Operation Morning Light.

===Suggested renaming===
In the late 2010s, many placenames within the Northwest Territories were restored to their indigenous names. It has been suggested--particularly because of the mention of slavery--that the lake be renamed as well. &quot;Great Slave Lake is actually a very terrible name, unless you&#x27;re a proponent of slavery,&quot; says Dëneze Nakehk&#x27;o, a Northwest Territories educator and founding member of First Nations organization Dene Nahjo. &quot;It&#x27;s a beautiful place. It&#x27;s majestic; it&#x27;s huge. And I don&#x27;t really think the current name on the map is fitting for that place.&quot; He has suggested Tu Nedhé, the Dene Soline name for the lake, as an alternative. Tucho, the Dehcho Dene term for the lake, has also been suggested.

==Geography and natural history==

The Hay, Slave (which in turn includes the Peace), Lockhart, and Taltson Rivers are its chief tributaries. It is drained by the Mackenzie River. Though the western shore is forested, the east shore and northern arm are tundra-like. The southern and eastern shores reach the edge of the Canadian Shield. Along with other lakes such as the Great Bear and Athabasca, it is a remnant of the vast glacial Lake McConnell.

The lake has a very irregular shoreline. The East Arm of Great Slave Lake is filled with islands, and the area is within the proposed Thaidene Nene National Park Reserve. The Pethei Peninsula separates the East Arm into McLeod Bay in the north and Christie Bay in the south. The lake is at least partially frozen during an average of eight months of the year.

The main western portion of the lake forms a moderately deep bowl with a surface area of and a volume of . This main portion has a maximum depth of and a mean depth of . To the east, McLeod Bay () and Christie Bay () are much deeper, with a maximum recorded depth in Christie Bay of .

On some of the plains surrounding Great Slave Lake, climax polygonal bogs have formed, the early successional stage to which often consists of pioneer black spruce.

South of Great Slave Lake, in a remote corner of Wood Buffalo National Park, is the Whooping Crane Summer Range, a nesting site of a remnant flock of whooping cranes, discovered in 1954.

===Ecology===
The Slave River provides the basin with high nutrient levels; accordingly, coupled with a general absence of pollution and invasive species, the lake is rich in aquatic life relative to its biome. Fish species include lake whitefish, lake trout, inconnu, northern pike and walleye, cisco, burbot, ninespine stickleback, shiner, also longnose sucker. Lake whitefish enjoy the highest levels, followed by cisco and suckers. Climate change, specifically reduced ice coverage times, is impacting the populations of these species. Copepoda are also prevalent in the lake.

==Bodies of water and tributaries==
Rivers that flow into Great Slave Lake include (going clockwise from the community of Behchokǫ̀):
* Emile River
* Snare River
* Wecho River
* Stagg River
* Yellowknife River
* Beaulieu River
* Waldron River
* Hoarfrost River
* Lockhart River
* Snowdrift River
* La Loche River
* Thubun River
* Terhul River
* Taltson River
* Slave River 
* Little Buffalo River
* Buffalo River
* Hay River
* Mosquito Creek
* Duport River
* Marian Lake
* North Arm
* Yellowknife Bay
* Resolution Bay
* Deep Bay
* McLeod Bay
* Christie Bay
* Sulphur Cove
* Presqu&#x27;ile Cove
* Rocher River
* Frank Channel
==Ice road==
Great Slave Lake has one ice road known as the Dettah ice road. It is a road that connects the Northwest Territories capital of Yellowknife to Dettah, a small First Nations fishing community also in the Northwest Territories. To reach the community in summer the drive is via the Ingraham Trail.

==&quot;Ice Lake Rebels&quot;==

From 2014 to 2016, Animal Planet aired a documentary series called &quot;Ice Lake Rebels&quot;. It takes place on Great Slave Lake, and details the lives of houseboaters on the lake.

<text>Tryptophan synthase or tryptophan synthetase is an enzyme () that catalyzes the final two steps in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. It is commonly found in Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, and Plantae. However, it is absent from Animalia. It is typically found as an α2β2 tetramer. The α subunits catalyze the reversible formation of indole and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) from indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP). The β subunits catalyze the irreversible condensation of indole and serine to form tryptophan in a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent reaction. Each α active site is connected to a β active site by a 25 Ångstrom long hydrophobic channel contained within the enzyme. This facilitates the diffusion of indole formed at α active sites directly to β active sites in a process known as substrate channeling. The active sites of tryptophan synthase are allosterically coupled.

==Enzyme structure==
=== Subunits ===
Tryptophan synthase typically exists as an α-ββ-α complex. The α and β subunits have molecular masses of 27 and 43 kDa respectively. The α subunit has a TIM barrel conformation. The β subunit has a fold type II conformation and a binding site adjacent to the active site for monovalent cations. Their assembly into a complex leads to structural changes in both subunits resulting in reciprocal activation. There are two main mechanisms for intersubunit communication. First, the COMM domain of the β-subunit and the α-loop2 of the α-subunit interact. Additionally, there are interactions between the αGly181 and βSer178 residues. The active sites are regulated allosterically and undergo transitions between open, inactive, and closed, active, states.

=== Hydrophobic channel ===
The α and β active sites are separated by a 25 Ångstrom long hydrophobic channel contained within the enzyme allowing for the diffusion of indole. If the channel did not exist, the indole formed at an α active site would quickly diffuse away and be lost to the cell as it is hydrophobic and can easily cross membranes. As such, the channel is essential for enzyme complex function.

==Enzyme mechanism==
The net reaction of tryptophan synthase turns indole-3-glycerol phosphate and serine into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, tryptophan and water. The reaction happens in two steps, each catalyzed by one of the subunits:

=== α subunit reaction ===
The α subunit catalyzes the formation of indole and G3P from a retro-aldol cleavage of IGP. The αGlu49 and αAsp60 are thought to be directly involved in the catalysis as shown. The rate limiting step is the isomerization of IGP. See image 2.

=== β subunit reaction ===
The β subunit catalyzes the β-replacement reaction in which indole and serine condense to form tryptophan in a PLP dependent reaction. The βLys87, βGlu109, and βSer377 are thought to be directly involved in the catalysis as shown. Again, the exact mechanism has not been conclusively determined. See image 2.

==Biological function==
Tryptophan synthase is commonly found in Eubacteria, Archaebacteria, Protista, Fungi, and Plantae. It is absent from animals such as humans. Tryptophan is one of the twenty standard amino acids and one of nine essential amino acids for humans. As such, tryptophan is a necessary component of the human diet.

== Substrate scope ==
Tryptophan synthetase is also known to accept indole analogues, e.g., fluorinated or methylated indoles, as substrates, generating the corresponding tryptophan analogues.

==Disease relevance==
As humans do not have tryptophan synthase, this enzyme has been explored as a potential drug target. However, it is thought that bacteria have alternate mechanisms to produce amino acids which might make this approach less effective. In either case, even if the drug only weakens bacteria, it might still be useful as the bacteria are already vulnerable in the hostile host environment. As such, the inhibition of tryptophan synthase along with other PLP-enzymes in amino acid metabolism has the potential to help solve medical problems.

Inhibition of tryptophan synthase and other PLP-enzymes in amino acid metabolism has been suggested for:
* Treatment of tuberculosis
* Treatment of ocular and genital infections
* Treatment of cryptosporidiosis
* Herbicide use

==Evolution==
It is thought that early in evolution the trpB2 gene was duplicated. One copy entered the trp operon as trpB2i allowing for its expression with trpA. TrpB2i formed transient complexes with TrpA and in the process activated TrpA unidirectionally. The other copy remained outside as trpB2o, and fulfilled an existing role or played a new one such as acting as a salvage protein for indole. TrpB2i evolved into TrpB1, which formed permanent complexes with trpA resulting in bidirectional activation. The advantage of the indole salvage protein declined and the TrpB gene was lost. Finally, the TrpB1 and TrpA genes were fused resulting in the formation the bifunctional enzyme.

==Historical significance==
Tryptophan synthase was the first enzyme identified that had two catalytic capabilities that were extensively studied. It was also the first identified to utilize substrate channeling. As such, this enzyme has been studied extensively and is the subject of great interest.

<text>RMS &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was a British-built ocean liner that sank near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River in Canada following a collision in thick fog with the Norwegian collier in the early hours of 29 May 1914, on route to Liverpool. Although the ship was equipped with watertight compartments and, in the aftermath of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster two years earlier, carried more than enough lifeboats for all aboard, she foundered in only 14 minutes. Of the 1,477 people on board, 1,012 died, making it the worst peacetime maritime disaster in Canadian history.

Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering built &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; and her sister ship, , at Govan on the Clyde in Scotland. The liners were commissioned by Canadian Pacific Steamships or CPR for the North Atlantic route between Liverpool and Quebec City. The transcontinental CPR and its fleet of ocean liners constituted the company&#x27;s self-proclaimed &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Transportation System&quot;. &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; had just begun her 96th voyage when she was lost.

The wreck of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; lies in of water, making it accessible to advanced divers. Many artifacts from the wreckage have been retrieved, some of which are on display in the Empress of Ireland Pavilion at the &quot;Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-Père&quot; in Rimouski, Quebec, and at the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Canadian government has passed legislation to protect the site.
==Background==
&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was the second of a pair of ocean liners ordered by Canadian Pacific Steamships during their early years in operation on the North Atlantic. In 1903, Canadian Pacific officially entered the market for trans-Atlantic passenger travel between the United Kingdom and Canada. In February of that year, they had purchased Elder Dempster &amp; Co, through which they obtained three ships from Elder&#x27;s subsidiary, the Beaver Line. These ships were &quot;Lake Champlain&quot;, &quot;Lake Erie&quot; and &quot;Lake Manitoba&quot;, with &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; being the first to sail on the company&#x27;s established route between Liverpool, England and Montreal, Quebec, the following April. The line proved to be successful on the North Atlantic trade, as in that first year, thirty-three westbound crossings were completed by those three ships, on which a combined total of 23,400 passengers travelled in third class, most of them immigrants bound for Canada.

==Description and construction==

In early 1904 work commenced at Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering in Glasgow, Scotland. The liners were designed by Francis Elgar and were specified to be twin screw liners with service speeds of . Both were of identical appearance, with two funnels and two masts, with equal passenger capacity of just over 1,500. In the early planning stages, their intended names were to have been &quot;Empress of Germany&quot; and &quot;Empress of Austria&quot;, but were later changed respectively to &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; and &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;, following the implementation of a policy that any future Canadian Pacific ship named in the &quot;Empress&quot; format would be respectively named after a dependency or colony of the British Empire.

The ship&#x27;s keel was laid down on 10 April 1905 for hull number 443 at Fairfield&#x27;s berth number 4 next to her sister ship, , which was being built. &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s length was overall and between perpendiculars. The beam was and her depth was . &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; had twin four-bladed propellers, each driven by a quadruple-expansion steam engine. Between them the two engines were rated at 3,168 NHP and gave her a service speed of . She had twin funnels and two masts.

&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s safety features included ten watertight bulkheads which divided the hull into eleven compartments which could be sealed off through the means of closing twenty-four watertight doors. All eleven bulkheads extended from the double bottom up to directly beneath the Shelter Deck, equivalent to three decks above the waterline. By design theory, the vessels could remain afloat with up to two adjacent compartments open to the sea. However, what would prove to be the fatal flaw in her design in 1914 was that, unlike aboard where the watertight doors could be closed by the means of a switch on the ship&#x27;s bridge, the watertight doors aboard &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; were required to be closed manually. Also, in the wake of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;, like many other liners, had her lifesaving equipment updated. When she first entered service in 1906, she had been equipped with standard wooden lifeboats, which in 1912 were replaced with sixteen steel lifeboats mounted in conventional radial davits, under which were stored another twenty-six wooden collapsible lifeboats, all of which combined had a capacity of 1,686 people, 280 more than the ship was licensed to carry.

&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was launched on 27 January 1906. With her original configuration she required a crew of 373, and had berths for 1,542 passengers in four classes on seven decks.

===Accommodation===

&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s First Class accommodation, located amidships on the upper and lower promenade and shelter decks, could accommodate 310 passengers when fully booked. Their accommodation included access to the open boat deck and two enclosed promenade decks which wrapped the full exterior of the upper and lower promenade decks. Located on the upper promenade deck was the music room, with built-in sofas and a grand piano encircling one of the ship&#x27;s most notable features, the glass dome over the first class dining room. Also on this deck was the top landing of the first class main staircase, which as similarly seen aboard &quot;Titanic&quot;, faced aft and extended down two decks to the entrance of the first class dining room. Located on the lower promenade deck was the First class library, situated at the forward end of the deck with windows overlooking the ship&#x27;s bow. Amidships was the first class cafe, which was pierced by the two-story well above the first class dining room, while at the aft end of the deck was the first class smoke room. One deck below on the shelter deck was the elegant first class dining room, which could seat 224 passengers in one sitting. In addition, a separate dining room for up to thirty first class children was located at the forward end of the deck. Finally, scattered across all three decks were arrays of two- and four-berth cabins.

The second class accommodation, in the stern on the lower Promenade, shelter, upper and main decks, could accommodate 150 more passengers than in first class, with a designed capacity for 468 in second class when fully booked. They were allotted open deck space at the after end of the lower promenade deck, extending from the after end of the superstructure to beneath the docking bridge at the end of the stern, while one deck below on the shelter deck was located additional deck space sheltered by the deck above. Also on the shelter deck were the second class smoke room, located at the aft end of the deck and designed in a similar but simpler fashion as what was seen in first class, with built-in sofas lining the outer walls and an adjacent bar. At the forward end of the deck, beneath the aft mast was the second class entrance, with a staircase running down two decks to the main deck. Aft of the main landing was the second class social hall, laid out in a fashion similar to the smoke room and provided with a piano, while forward of the entrance was the second class dining room, large enough to seat 256 passengers at one serving. On the starboard side of the upper deck and in the three compartments aft of the engine room casing on the main deck were an array of two and four berth cabins, designed to be interchangeable to both first class and third class. According to the ship&#x27;s deck plans, cabins for 134 passengers on the upper deck were designed to be converted to first class cabins if needed, while the cabins for 234 passengers on the main deck could simultaneously be converted to be used for third class passengers if needed.

As for immigrants and lower-class travellers, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was designed with accommodations which symbolised the dramatic shift in immigrant travel on the North Atlantic commonly seen between the turn of the 20th Century and the outbreak of the First World War, that being a general layout which included both the &#x27;old&#x27; and &#x27;new&#x27; steerage. Combined, these provided accommodation for 764 passengers at the forward end of the ship. Passengers travelling in these two classes had some shared public areas, including access to the forward well deck on the shelter deck, as well as a large open space on the Upper Deck very similar to the open space later seen aboard &quot;Titanic&quot;. This open space, which spanned the full width of the ship and the length of two watertight compartments, included wooden benches lining the outer walls, and a large children&#x27;s sand pit enclosed by a wooden fence. At the after end of this space were two smaller public rooms, side by side against the adjacent bulkhead. On the port side was the third class ladies&#x27; room, which included a piano, while across on the starboard side was the third class smoke room, complete with an adjacent bar. On the main and lower decks, the accommodations separated, with the &#x27;new&#x27; steerage, more commonly referred to as third class, providing for 494 passengers, and the &#x27;old&#x27; steerage providing for 270 passengers. Accommodation for Third class consisted of four sections of two, four and six berth cabins, three on the main deck and one on the lower deck, and defined by watertight bulkheads. Directly aft of the section on the main deck was the third class dining room, which was large enough to seat 300 passengers in one sitting. The old steerage consisted of three sections of open berths, one on the main deck and two on the lower deck, all forward of the third class sections. Each section consisted of two-tiered bunks, individual pantries and long wooden tables with benches.

==Career==
Two months after &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; entered service, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; departed Liverpool for Quebec City on her on Thursday, 29 June 1906. The following morning she made port at Moville, a coastal town on the north coast of Ireland, to pick up a number of Irish immigrants before making for the open Atlantic. On her first trip across the Atlantic she carried 1,257 passengers, with 119 in First Class and 342 in Second Class, and Third Class being booked well past capacity with 796, which included a large number of small children and infants among them. Seen as a foreshadowing of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;&#x27;s popularity with immigrants, Third Class was so heavily overbooked on her maiden voyage that at least 100 passengers who had booked passage aboard her had to be left behind in Liverpool to wait for the next ship.

On the afternoon of 6 July, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; arrived at the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River, calling at Pointe-au-Père to pick up a river pilot who would assist in guiding the ship down the final 300-kilometre stretch of the voyage to Quebec City. While off Rimouski, another small boat met &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; to collect all Canadian-bound mail and drop off a group of people working to aid in preparing for the liner&#x27;s arrival. These consisted of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) ticketing agents who would meet with all the passengers to arrange for their transportation by rail to their final destinations across Canada; Canadian immigration and customs officials who would inspect luggage and check passenger documents, and doctors to examine all passengers to check for any illnesses which would warrant quarantine at Grosse Isle, a process all but one of the ship&#x27;s passengers passed through successfully. &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; arrived in Quebec City early the following morning, where passengers disembarked and cargo was offloaded, and after a six-day turnaround she sailed on her first eastbound crossing back to Liverpool on 12 July. 
Over the next eight years, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; completed the same process of transporting passengers and cargo between Britain and Canada, with alternating Canadian ports by season, terminating at Quebec City in May through October and at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Saint John, New Brunswick, in November through April when the river was frozen over. By 1913 &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was equipped with wireless telegraphy, operating on the 300 and 600 metre wavelengths. Her call sign was MPL.

&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s final successful crossing ended when she arrived at Quebec City from Liverpool on 22 May 1914, by which time she had completed 95 successful round trips, and transported 119,262 passengers westbound to Canada and another 67,838 eastbound to Britain.

==Final crossing==
&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; departed Quebec City for Liverpool at 16:30 local time (EST) on 28 May 1914, manned by a crew of 420 and carrying 1,057 passengers, roughly two thirds of her total capacity. In first class, the list of passengers was relatively small, with only 87 booked passages. The small number did not, however, spare the inclusion of some rather notable figures from both sides of the Atlantic.
* Col. Robert Bloomfield of New Zealand&#x27;s 3rd Mounted Regiment, his wife Isabella and their daughter Hilda.
* Laurence Irving, son of famous Victorian stage actor Sir Henry Irving, who since 1912 had been on an extended stage tour of Australia and North America, together with his wife and stage partner Mabel Hackney.
* Sir Henry Seton-Karr, a former member of the British House of Commons returning home from a hunting trip to British Columbia.
* Henry Lyman, head of the firm Lyman, Sons &amp; Co, which in 1914 was the largest pharmaceutical company in Canada, who was bound for Europe for a belated honeymoon with his young wife, Florence.
* Wallace Palmer, associate editor for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and his wife Ethel.
* George Smart, Inspector of British Immigrant Children and Receiving Homes.
* Lt. Col. Charles Tylee of the Canadian Army and his wife Martha.

Second class saw a considerably larger booking at just over half capacity with 253 passengers, owed greatly to a large party of Salvation Army members and their families, numbering 170 in all, who were travelling to attend the 3rd International Salvation Army Congress in London.

Third class saw the largest booking, which with 717 passengers was nearly filled to capacity. This complement reflected greatly the typical mix of steerage travellers seen on eastbound crossings aboard &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; and her running mates on the North Atlantic which paralleled that seen on westbound crossings from Liverpool. While on westbound crossings third class passengers were predominantly diverse mixes of immigrants, eastbound crossings saw equally diverse blends of former immigrants from both Canada and the United States returning to their native countries in Europe. Many were returning to visit relatives, while others were in the process of re-emigrating and resettling.

Henry George Kendall had been promoted to captain of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; at the beginning of the month, and it was his first trip down the Saint Lawrence River in command of her.

===Collision and sinking===

&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; reached Pointe-au-Père in the early hours of 29 May 1914, where the pilot disembarked. She resumed a normal outward bound course of about N76E (076 degrees) and soon sighted the masthead lights of SS &quot;Storstad&quot;, a Norwegian collier, on her starboard bow at a distance of several miles. Likewise, &quot;Storstad&quot;, which was abreast of Métis Point and on a virtually reciprocal course of W. by S. (259 degrees), sighted &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s masthead lights. These first sightings were made in clear weather conditions, but fog soon enveloped the ships. The ships resorted to repeated use of their fog whistles. At 01:56 local time &quot;Storstad&quot; crashed into &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s starboard side at around midships. &quot;Storstad&quot; remained afloat, but &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was severely damaged. A gaping hole in her side caused the lower decks to flood at a rate alarming to the crew. Captain Kendall shouted to the crew of &quot;Storstad&quot; with a megaphone to keep her engines at full power and plug the hole, but &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; continued her forward motion, and the current of the St. Lawrence shoved &quot;Storstad&quot; away after about five seconds, allowing of water per second to begin pouring into &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;.

&quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; lurched heavily to starboard and began settling by the stern. There was no time to shut the watertight doors. Water entered through open portholes, some only a few feet above the water line, and inundated passageways and cabins. Most of the passengers and crew located in the lower decks drowned quickly. Those berthed in the upper decks were awakened by the collision and immediately boarded lifeboats on the boat deck. Within a few minutes, the ship&#x27;s list was so severe that the port lifeboats could not be launched. Some passengers attempted to do so but the lifeboats just crashed into the side of the ship, spilling their occupants into the frigid water. Five starboard lifeboats were launched successfully, while a sixth and seventh capsized during lowering.

The lights and power on &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; eventually failed five or six minutes after the collision, plunging the ship into darkness. Ten minutes after the collision, the ship rolled violently over her starboard side, allowing as many as 700 passengers and crew to crawl out of the portholes and decks onto her port side. The ship lay upon her side for a minute or two, having seemingly run aground. Shortly afterwards at 02:10, about 14 minutes after the collision, the bow rose briefly out of the water and the ship finally sank. Hundreds of people were thrown into the near-freezing water. The disaster resulted in the deaths of 1,012 people. After being rescued by the &quot;Storstad&quot;, Kendall travelled directly to the bridge to confront the recently awoken Captain Thomas Anderson, saying &quot;You have just sunk my ship!&quot;.

===Casualties and survivors===

There were only 465 survivors: 4 children (of 138), 41 women (of 310), 172 men (of 609), and 248 crew (of 420). The fact that most passengers were asleep at the time of the sinking (most not even awakened by the collision) also contributed to the loss of life when they were drowned in their cabins, most of them from the starboard side where the collision happened.

Amongst the dead were the English dramatist and novelist Laurence Irving and his wife Mabel Hackney; the explorer Henry Seton-Karr; Ella Hart-Bennett, the wife of British government official William Hart-Bennett; and Gabriel J. Marks, the first mayor of Suva, Fiji, along with his wife Marion. Lieutenant Charles Lindsay Claude Bowes-Lyon, a first cousin of the future Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother survived the disaster, but died in combat only five months later on the Western Front near Ypres. The passengers included 167 members of the Salvation Army. These travellers, all but eight of whom died, were members of the Canadian Staff Band who were travelling to London for an international conference.

One of the four children who survived was 7-year-old Grace Hanagan, who was born in Oshawa, Ontario, on 16 May 1907, and was travelling with her parents, who were among the Salvation Army members who did not survive. Grace was also the last survivor of the sinking and died in St. Catharines, Ontario, on 15 May 1995 at the age of 87.

===Rescue operations===

&quot;Storstad&quot;, which remained afloat, lowered her own lifeboats and began to rescue the survivors in the water. The radio operator at Pointe-au-Père who picked up the emergency signal from &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; notified two Canadian government steamers: the pilot boat &quot;Eureka&quot; at Pointe-au-Père Wharf, which left the wharf at full steam at 02:30; followed by the mail ship &quot;Lady Evelyn&quot; at Rimouski Wharf which left at 02:45. &quot;Eureka&quot; was first on the scene at 03:10 and rescued about 150 survivors from the water. She brought the survivors first to Pointe-au-Père, but was redirected to Rimouski Wharf where doctors and relief supplies were waiting. &quot;Lady Evelyn&quot; arrived at the site of sinking at 03:45. No survivors were left in the water but &quot;Lady Evelyn&quot; collected the 200 survivors rescued by &quot;Storstad&quot;, as well as 133 bodies, and arrived to join &quot;Eureka&quot; at the Rimouski Wharf about 05:15. &quot;Storstad&quot; was damaged but not severely, so her captain continued on to Quebec.

One of the survivors was Captain Kendall, who was on the bridge at the time of the collision and quickly ordered the lifeboats to be launched. When &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; lurched onto her side, he was thrown from the bridge into the water, and was taken down with her as she began to go under. Swimming to the surface, he clung to a wooden grate long enough for crew members aboard a nearby lifeboat to row over and pull him in. Immediately, Kendall took command of the small boat and began rescue operations. The lifeboat&#x27;s crew successfully pulled in many people from the water, and when the boat was full, Kendall ordered the crew to row to the lights of &quot;Storstad&quot; so that the survivors could be dropped off. He and the crew made a few more trips between &quot;Storstad&quot; and the wreck site to search for more survivors. After an hour or two, Kendall gave up, since any survivors who were still in the water would have either succumbed to hypothermia or drowned by then. Upon first boarding &quot;Storstad&quot;, Kendall stormed to the bridge, and levied an accusation at Captain Thomas Andersen: &quot;You have sunk my ship!&quot;

==Investigation==
=== Commissioners ===

The Commission of Inquiry, held in Quebec, commenced on 16 June 1914 and lasted for eleven days. Presiding over the contentious proceedings was Lord Mersey, who had previously presided over the SOLAS summit the year before, and had headed the official inquiries into a number of significant steamship tragedies, including that of &quot;Titanic&quot;. The following year, he would lead the inquiry into the sinking of &quot;Lusitania&quot;. Assisting Lord Mersey were two other commissioners: Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier of Quebec, and Chief Justice Ezekiel McLeod of New Brunswick. All three commissioners were officially appointed by John Douglas Hazen, the Minister of Marine and Fisheries of Canada, under Part X of the &quot;Canada Shipping Act&quot;.

=== Twenty questions ===
At the beginning of the Inquiry twenty questions were formulated by the Canadian government. For example, was &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; sufficiently and efficiently officered and manned? (Q.4); after the vessels had sighted each other&#x27;s lights did the atmosphere between them become foggy or misty, so that lights could no longer be seen? If so, did both vessels comply with SOLAS Articles 15 and 16, and did they respectively indicate on their steam whistles or sirens, the course or courses they were taking by the signals set out? (Q.11); was a good and proper lookout kept on board of both vessels? (Q.19); and, was the loss of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; or the loss of life, caused by the wrongful act or default of the Master and First Officer of that vessel, and the Master, First, Second and Third Officers of &quot;Storstad&quot;, or any of them? (Q.20). All of these questions were addressed by the inquiry and answered in full in its report.

=== Witnesses ===
The inquiry heard testimony from a total of sixty-one witnesses: twenty-four crew and officers of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; (including Captain Kendall); twelve crew and officers of &quot;Storstad&quot; (including Captain Andersen); five passengers of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;; and twenty other people including two divers, two Marconi wireless operators at Pointe-au-Père, two naval architects, the harbour master at Quebec, and crew and officers of several other ships whose involvement either directly or indirectly was deemed pertinent.

=== Two stories ===
As reported in the newspapers at the time, there was much confusion as to the cause of the collision with both parties claiming the other was at fault. As was noted at the subsequent inquiry, &quot;If the testimony of both captains were to be believed, the collision happened as both vessels were stationary with their engines stopped&quot;. The witnesses from &quot;Storstad&quot; said they were approaching so as to pass red to red (port to port) while those from &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; said they were approaching so as to pass green to green (starboard to starboard), but &quot;the stories are irreconcilable&quot;.

Two very different accounts of the collision were given at the Inquiry. &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s crew reported that after the pilot had been dropped at Pointe-au-Père, the ship proceeded to sea at full speed in order to obtain an offing from the shore. After a short time the masthead lights of a steamer, which subsequently proved to be &quot;Storstad&quot;, were sighted on the starboard bow, approximately away, the weather at that time being fine and clear. After continuing for some time, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; altered her course with the object of proceeding down the river. When making this change, the masthead lights of &quot;Storstad&quot; were still visible, about away, and according to Captain Kendall it was intended to pass &quot;Storstad&quot; starboard to starboard at no risk of collision. The green light of &quot;Storstad&quot; was then sighted, but a little later a fog bank was seen coming off the land that dimmed &quot;Storstad&quot;″s lights. The engines of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; were then stopped (and put full speed astern) and her whistle blown three short blasts signifying that this had been done. About a minute later the fog shut out the lights of &quot;Storstad&quot; completely. After exchanging further whistle blasts with &quot;Storstad&quot;, her masthead and side lights were seen by Captain Kendall about 100 feet away almost at right angles to &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; and approaching at high speed. In the hope of possibly avoiding or minimizing the effect of a collision the engines of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; were ordered full speed ahead, but it was too late and &quot;Storstad&quot; struck &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; amidships. Kendall placed the blame firmly on &quot;Storstad&quot; for the collision. Famously, the first words he said to Captain Andersen of &quot;Storstad&quot; after the sinking were, &quot;You have sunk my ship!&quot;. He maintained for the rest of his life that it was not his fault the collision occurred.
&quot;Storstad&quot;″s crew reported that the masthead lights of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; were first seen on the port bow about 6 or away; the lights were at that time open to starboard. A few minutes later, the green side light of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was seen apparently from away. The green light remained for an interval, and then &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was seen to make a change in her course. Her masthead lights came into a (vertical) line, and she showed both the green and the red side lights. She then continued to swing to starboard, shutting out the green and showing only the red light. This light was observed for a few minutes before being obscured by the fog. At this moment, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was about two miles away and &quot;Storstad&quot;″s Chief Officer, Mr. Toftenes, assumed that it was &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s intention to pass him port to port (red to red), which the ships would do with ample room if their relative positions were maintained. After an exchange of whistle blasts with &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;, &quot;Storstad&quot; was slowed and Captain Andersen (who was asleep in his cabin at the time) was called to the bridge. When he arrived, Andersen saw a masthead light moving quickly across &quot;Storstad&quot;″s course from port to starboard whereupon he ordered the engines full speed astern. Immediately after Andersen saw the masthead light, he saw the green light, and a few moments later saw &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; and the ships then collided.

=== Report ===
After all the evidence that had been heard, the Commissioners stated that the question as to who was to blame resolved itself into a simple issue, namely which of the two ships changed her course during the fog. They could come to &quot;no other conclusion&quot; than that it was &quot;Storstad&quot; that ported her helm and changed her course to starboard, and so brought about the collision. Chief Officer Toftenes of &quot;Storstad&quot; was specifically blamed for wrongly and negligently altering his course in the fog and, in addition, failing to call the captain when he saw the fog coming on.

Ultimately, the swift sinking and immense loss of life was attributed to three factors: the location in which &quot;Storstad&quot; made contact, failure to close &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s watertight doors, and longitudinal bulkheads that exacerbated the list by inhibiting cross flooding. A contributing factor was open portholes. Surviving passengers and crew testified that some upper portholes were left open for ventilation. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requires that any openable portholes be closed and locked before leaving port, but portholes were often left open in sheltered waters like the Saint Lawrence River where heavy seas were not expected. When &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; began to list to starboard, water poured through the open portholes further increasing flooding.

After the official inquiry was completed, Captain Andersen was quoted as saying that Lord Mersey was a &quot;fool&quot; for holding him responsible for the collision. He also announced that he intended to file a lawsuit against the CPR.

===Litigation===
The CPR won a court case against A. F. Klaveness &amp; Co, the owners of &quot;Storstad&quot;, for C$2 million, which is the valuation of silver bullion stored aboard &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; when she sank. The owners of &quot;Storstad&quot; entered an unsuccessful counterclaim against the CPR for $50,000 damages, contending that &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was at fault and alleging negligent navigation on her part. &quot;Storstad&quot; was seized at the request of the CPR and sold for $175,000 to Prudential Trust, an insurance company acting on behalf of AF Klaveness &amp; Co.

===Aftermath===
On 5 June 1914, Canadian Pacific announced it had chartered the Allan Line&#x27;s &quot;Virginian&quot; to fill in the void in service in its fleet left by the loss of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;, joining &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; and other previously acquired Canadian Pacific ships on the Saint Lawrence run. &quot;Virginian&quot; embarked from her first voyage from Liverpool under Canadian Pacific service on 12 June, which was to have been the next departure date from Liverpool of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;.

===&quot;The Last Voyage of the Empress&quot;===
In 2005 a Canadian television film, &quot;The Last Voyage of the Empress&quot;, investigated the sinking with historical reference, model re-enactment, and underwater investigation. The program&#x27;s opinion was that the cause of the incident appeared to be the fog, exacerbated by the actions of Captain Kendall. Both captains were in their own way telling the truth, but with Kendall omitting the expediency of commanding &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; in such a way as to keep his company&#x27;s advertised speed of Atlantic crossing. In order to pass &quot;Storstad&quot; (off &quot;Empress&quot;″s starboard bow) to quickly expedite this maintenance of speed, Kendall, in the fog, turned to starboard (towards &quot;Storstad&quot;) as part of a manoeuvre to spin back to his previous heading to pass the other ship as originally intended on his starboard side, thereby avoiding what he saw as a time-wasting diversion from his preferred and fast route through the channel. When Captain Anderson of &quot;Storstad&quot; saw &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; through the fog he thought, by seeing both &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;″s port and starboard lights during its manoeuvre, that &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was attempting to pass on the opposite side of &quot;Storstad&quot; than previously apparent and turned his ship to starboard to avoid a collision. However, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; turned to port to continue on its original time-saving heading; thus the bow to side collision.

The conclusion of the programme was that both captains failed to abide by the condition that, on encountering fog, ships should maintain their heading, although the captain of &quot;Storstad&quot; deviated only after seeing the deviation of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot;. In the film, water tank replication of the incident indicated that &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; could not have been stationary at the point of the collision. It also indicated—through underwater observations of the ship&#x27;s engine order telegraph in the engine room—that Kendall&#x27;s assertion that he gave the order to close watertight doors was probably not true.

===Legacy===
The sinking of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; proved that the reverse slanting, inverted or &quot;tumblehome&quot; prow so common at the time, was deadly in the event of a ship-to-ship collision because it caused massive damage below the waterline, effectively acting as a ram which would smash through an unarmoured hull without difficulty (especially if the ship was steaming at some speed). The bow of &quot;Storstad&quot; struck &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; like a &quot;chisel into tin&quot;. As a result of the disaster, naval designers began to employ the raked bow with the top of the prow forward. This ensured that the energy of any collision would be minimised beneath the surface and only the parts of the bow above the waterline would be affected.

The rapid sinking of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; has also been cited by 20th-century naval architects, John Reid and William Hovgaard, as an example for making the case of discontinuation of longitudinal bulkheads which provide forward and aft separation between the outer coal bunkers and the inner compartments on ships. Though not entirely watertight, these longitudinal bulkheads trapped water between them. When the spaces flooded, this quickly forced a ship to list, pushing the portholes underwater. As flooding continued entering accommodation spaces, this only exacerbated the listing of the ship and dragging of the main deck down into the water. This would lead to the flooding of the upper compartments and finally the capsize and sinking of the ship. Reid and Hovgaard both cited the &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; disaster as evidence which supported their conclusions that longitudinal subdivisions were very hazardous in ship collisions.

The foundering throes of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; are used in Chapter 2, and the wreck site features in Part IV of the Dirk Pitt adventure, &quot;Night Probe!&quot; by Clive Cussler.

==Wreck site==
===Salvage operation===
Shortly after the disaster, a salvage operation began on &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; to recover the purser&#x27;s safe and the mail. This was deemed a plausible effort due to the wreck&#x27;s relatively shallow depth at , shallow enough so that in the aftermath of the sinking, the mainmast and funnels of the &quot;Empress&quot; were still visible just beneath the surface.

As they recovered bodies and valuables from the ship, the salvors were faced with limited visibility and strong currents from the Saint Lawrence River. One of the hard-hat divers, Edward Cossaboom, was killed when, it is assumed, he slipped from the hull of the wreck plummeting another to the riverbed below, closing or rupturing his air hose as he fell. He was found lying unconscious on his lifeline and all attempts to revive him after he was brought to the surface failed. It was later reported, implausibly, that the sudden increase in water pressure had so compressed the diver&#x27;s body that all that remained was a &quot;jellyfish with a copper mantle and dangling canvas tentacles.&quot; The salvage crew resumed their operations and recovered 318 bags of mail and 251 bars of silver (silver bullion) worth about $150,000 ($1,099,000 in 2013 when adjusted for inflation).

In 1964, the wreck was revisited by a group of Canadian divers who recovered a brass bell. In the 1970s, another group of divers recovered a telemotor, pieces of Marconi wireless equipment, a brass porthole and a compass. Robert Ballard, the oceanographer and maritime archaeologist who discovered the wrecks of &quot;Titanic&quot; and the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, visited the wreck of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; and found that she was being covered by silt. He also discovered that certain artefacts from fixtures to human remains continued to be taken out by &quot;treasure hunters&quot;.
===Protecting the site===
In the province of Quebec, shipwrecks are not afforded explicit protection. However, in 1999 the wreck was declared a site of historical and archaeological importance and thus became protected under the Cultural Property Act and was listed in the register of Historic Sites of Canada. This was the first time that an underwater site had received this status in Quebec.

This protection was important because, unlike &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; rests at the relatively shallow depth of . While accessible to skilled recreational divers, the site is dangerous due to the cold water, strong currents and restricted visibility. As of 2009 six people had lost their lives on the dive.

==Memorials==
A number of monuments were erected, particularly by the CPR, to mark the burial places of those passengers and crew whose bodies were recovered in the days that followed the tragic sinking. For example, there are two monuments at Rimouski. One monument is located on the coastal road between Rimouski and Pointe-au-Père and is dedicated to the memory of eighty-eight persons; it is inscribed with twenty names, but the sixty-eight other persons are unidentified. A second monument is located at the cemetery in Rimouski (&quot;Les Jardins commémoratifs Saint-Germain&quot;) and is dedicated to the memory of a further seven persons, four of whom are named.

The CPR also erected several monuments in Quebec, e.g., Mount Hermon Cemetery and St. Patrick&#x27;s Cemetery, both of which are located on the Sillery Heritage Site, at the formerly independent city of Sillery.

The Salvation Army erected its own monument at the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto. The inscription reads, &quot;In Sacred Memory of 167 Officers and Soldiers of the Salvation Army Promoted to Glory From the Empress of Ireland at Daybreak, Friday May 29, 1914&quot;. A memorial service is held there every year on the anniversary of the accident.

==Commemorations==
The hundredth anniversary of the sinking of &quot;Empress of Ireland&quot; was commemorated in May 2014, by numerous events, including an exhibition at the Canadian Museum of History entitled &quot;Empress of Ireland: Canada&#x27;s Titanic&quot; which moved to the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 in 2015.

Canada Post issued two stamps to commemorate the event. The Empress of Ireland domestic Permanent stamp was designed by Isabelle Toussaint, and is lithographed in seven colours. The Official First Day Cover was cancelled in Rimouski where survivors and victims were initially brought following the tragedy. The international denomination stamp was designed by Susan Scott using the oil on canvas illustration she commissioned from marine artist Aristides Balanos, and printed using lithography in six colours. The Official First Day Cover was cancelled at Pointe-au-Père, Quebec, the town closest to the site of the sinking.

The Royal Canadian Mint has also issued a 2014 coin commemorating the disaster.

<text>Kaonde (&quot;kiiKaonde&quot;) is a Bantu language spoken primarily in Zambia but also in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kaonde and its dialects are spoken and understood by perhaps 350,000 people or more. 

==Speakers==
It is estimated that approximately 2.3% of Zambians are native Kaonde speakers. Kaonde speakers overwhelmingly live in the Northwestern and parts of Central regions of Zambia. Fewer numbers of Kaonde speakers live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, they are not known or identified by the term Kaonde but rather by the term Luba. In Zambia, Kaonde people occupying the following districts: Solwezi,Mufumbwe,Kasempa,Kalumbila and Mushindamo in the North-Western province, and Mumbwa in the Central province. Kaonde villages can also be found in the northern parts of Kaoma District in the Western Province.

Strictly speaking, the term &quot;Kaonde&quot; refers to a group of people who are identified by a common language known as kiiKaonde. This group of people, like many others in Zambia, was originally part of the Luba Kingdom. They migrated south to area surrounding a stream called Kaonde in river Congo Basin. From there, the people migrated into what is now Northwestern Zambia. This group of people called their language kiiKaonde. Speakers of other Bantu languages use the prefix &quot;chi&quot; other than &quot;kii&quot; to refer to this language.

Just like any other tribe in Zambia, Kaondes are ruled by the traditional leaders. The following are the chiefs of the Kaonde people recognised by the government of Zambia: Senior Chief Kapiji Kasongo Kamuyange Mujimanzovu, Senior Chief Kasempa, Chief Kapiji Mpanga, Chief Mumena, Chief Matebo, Chief Ingwe, Chief Mukumbi Kizela, Chief Mushima Mubambe, Chief Mulendema, Chief Mumba, Chief Kaindu, Chief Mukumbi Katotola and Senior Chief Mukumbi Ibaloli ( Originally, Mukumbi Ibaloli is a Lunda)

== Grammar ==
=== Nouns ===
Like other Bantu languages, Kaonde nouns are grouped into several semantic classes, ranging from those that denote human beings to those that denote things. The concord or agreement markers for each class is a prefix attached to verbs and adjectives related to the noun. Tense markers may modify the concord.
=== Pronouns ===
Kaonde has personal, demonstrative and relative pronouns. The first and second person pronouns are independent of the noun class system. Third person pronouns are formed using the demonstrative pronouns for the ba noun class. Demonstrative are arranged by noun class and by deixis.
Sample text in Kaonde

&quot;Mu byambo byanji byalamata bantu bonse, Lesa waambile ne byambo bikwabo pa byo anemeka bumi ne mashi&quot;.

Translation

In a declaration applying to all humans, God revealed more about his evaluation of life and blood

<text>SS &quot;Lusitania&quot; was a Portuguese twin-screw ocean liner of 5,557 tons, built in 1906 by Sir Raylton Dixon &amp; Co, and owned by Empresa Nacional de Navegação, of Lisbon.

The ship was wrecked on Bellows Rock off Cape Point, South Africa at 24h00 on 18 April 1911 in fog while en route from Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), Mozambique, with 25 first-class, 57 second-class and 121 third-class passengers, and 475 African labourers. Out of the 774 people on board, eight died when a life boat capsized. On 20 April the ship slipped off the rock into of water to the east of the rock. The wreck has become a fairly well known recreational dive site, but at 33 to 40 metres, it is deeper than recommended for the average recreational diver, and the currents and breakers over the reef make it a moderately challenging dive.
The sinking of &quot;Lusitania&quot; spurred the local authorities to construct a new lighthouse on the Cape Point.

<text>Notts County Football Club is a professional football club in Nottingham, England, which competes in EFL League Two, the fourth tier of English football, following promotion from the National League in the 2022–23 season. Founded in 1862, Notts County are the oldest professional football club in the world. They first competed in the FA Cup in 1877 and in 1888 became one of the twelve founding members of the Football League. Notts County have been promoted fourteen times, relegated seventeen times and have played in each of the top five divisions of English football.

Notts County won the FA Cup in 1894; their highest league finishes were third in 1890–91 and 1900–01. In 1947, they signed England international Tommy Lawton, whose presence attracted large crowds, but the club fell into decline after his departure and was in the Fourth Division by the 1960s. Under Jimmy Sirrel&#x27;s management, they won three promotions in the 1970s and 1980s to reach the First Division in 1981. Notts County&#x27;s most recent season in the top division was 1991–92 under Neil Warnock, who had overseen back-to-back promotions via the play-offs at Wembley Stadium. Beginning in the early 21st century, Notts County were affected by a series of serious off-field problems, culminating in relegation to non-League football in 2019. They spent four years as a non-League club before returning to the league in 2023.

The team have played their home games at Meadow Lane since 1910, having earlier played at a number of venues including Trent Bridge. The club colours of black and white were first adopted in 1890, inspiring their nickname of the &quot;Magpies&quot;, and at the end of 1901 Notts lent their colours to Juventus. Notts County first played their neighbours Nottingham Forest in 1866, making the Nottingham derby one of football&#x27;s oldest fixtures. The club&#x27;s record appearance holder is goalkeeper Albert Iremonger, who played 601 games in a 22-year spell with the team, and their record goal scorer is Les Bradd with 137 goals.

==History==
===Formation to World War I===
Although formally organised on 7 December 1864, Notts County&#x27;s traditional foundation date is 1862. From about this time, the founding members had met in The Park, Nottingham, to practice football amongst themselves, and these gatherings came to be regarded as the club&#x27;s beginning. Notts played their first recorded match on 8 December 1864 at Nottingham&#x27;s Meadows Cricket Ground, against a team known as Trent Valley. On 2 January 1865, Notts were beaten 1–0 by Sheffield at the Meadows, the latter&#x27;s first match against an opponent from outside of Sheffield. The club&#x27;s early members were overwhelmingly from middle class backgrounds, including bankers, solicitors and men involved in Nottingham&#x27;s lacemaking industry. Notts are thought to have mostly played under Sheffield Rules in their early days, though certain matches are recorded as being played according to &quot;Nottingham Rules&quot;.

In 1872, Harwood Greenhalgh played for England in the first international match against Scotland, so becoming Notts County&#x27;s first international representative. The club entered the FA Cup for the first time in the 1877–78 season, and the team reached semi-finals in 1883 (losing to Old Etonians) and 1884 (losing to Blackburn Rovers). It was during this period that Harry Cursham played for Notts; his 49 FA Cup goals remains the competition record. The Football Association legalised professionalism in 1885, and Notts immediately recognised six of its players as professionals. In 1888, the club had just experienced what Mark Metcalf described as their worst ever season, but nevertheless Notts County became one of the 12 founding members of the Football League. Notts finished 11th in the competition&#x27;s inaugural year and were obliged to apply for re-election to the League for the following season; the club received seven votes, the fewest of the four League clubs required to reapply for their place, but nonetheless were re-elected.

In 1891, Notts County reached the FA Cup final for the first time. The week before the final, Notts defeated their opponents Blackburn 7–1 in a league match, a result that left the former as a strong favourite to win the Cup. However, Blackburn would win the final 3–1 at Kennington Oval. The Magpies were relegated for the first time in 1893, but in 1894 became the first Second Division team to win the FA Cup. The team defeated Bolton Wanderers 4–1 in the final at Goodison Park, Liverpool, with Jimmy Logan scoring a hat-trick, one of three men to score three goals in an FA Cup final. Notts won the Second Division championship in the 1896–97 season, and won promotion to the First Division following a series of &quot;test matches&quot;. The Magpies would spend 18 of the next 19 seasons in the first tier; in 1913–14, their only season outside of the First Division, the team won the Second Division title.

===Inter-war years, Lawton era and decline===
League football was suspended for most of World War I. Upon its resumption in 1919–20, Notts were relegated to the Second Division. In 1921–22, while still a Second Division club, the Magpies reached the FA Cup semi-final, losing 3–1 to Huddersfield Town at Turf Moor, Burnley. In 1922–23, Notts won the Second Division championship and promotion back to the First Division, where they remained for three seasons. The team conceded only 31 goals and were in contention for the league championship for much of the 1924–25 season, but they were relegated the following year; Keith Warsop speculates that a change to the offside law was the reason for Notts County&#x27;s swift decline. The Magpies were relegated to the third tier for the first time in 1930, but they immediately won promotion back to the Second Division as champions of the Third Division South. It was during 1930–31 that Tom Keetley scored 39 league goals for Notts, a club record which would stand for 92 years.

By 1935, Notts County were back in the Third Division South, where they remained at the outbreak of World War II; once again, competitive football was suspended. In 1947, after the league had resumed, and whilst still a third tier club, Notts paid £20,000, then the British transfer record, to sign England international forward Tommy Lawton. Lawton&#x27;s presence resulted in a significant increase in Notts County&#x27;s crowds. A home match with Swansea Town on Boxing Day 1947 was attended by 45,116 spectators, with an estimated 10,000 locked outside. Over the next three seasons, Lawton forged a productive goalscoring partnership with Jackie Sewell, culminating in the Magpies winning the Third Division South title in the 1949–50 season. The championship was secured with a 2–0 home win over Nottingham Forest played before 46,000 spectators.

Sewell was controversially sold to Sheffield Wednesday in 1951, and Lawton left in 1952. Notts spent most of the 1950s in the Second Division, but suffered consecutive relegations in 1958 and 1959 to drop into the Fourth Division for the first time. They immediately won promotion as runners-up, and celebrated their centenary in 1962 as a Third Division club; the occasion was marked with a friendly against an England XI. Prominent players during this period include Tony Hateley, who established himself as one the club&#x27;s most prolific strikers before being sold to Aston Villa in 1963. The Magpies were ultimately relegated back to the Fourth Division in 1963–64, and continued to struggle for the next few years; in 1966–67, the team finished 20th, avoiding the need to apply for re-election only on goal average ahead of Rochdale.

===Sirrel and Warnock eras===
In 1969, Notts County appointed Jimmy Sirrel as manager. He already had several promising players at his disposal, including Les Bradd, to become Notts County&#x27;s all-time record goal scorer, and Don Masson, described in one club history as Notts County&#x27;s greatest ever passer of the ball. In 1970–71, Hateley returned to the club; he scored 22 goals and the Magpies won the Fourth Division championship. The team amassed 69 points, equalling the then record, and completed the entire season unbeaten at home. Notts narrowly missed out on consecutive promotions in 1971–72, finishing fourth in the Third Division, but they ended runners-up a year later, and so were promoted to the Second Division. Masson was sold to Queens Park Rangers in 1974, and Sirrel left to become manager of Sheffield United a year later. Notts fell short of promotion in 1975–76, but they did knock First Division Leeds United out of the League Cup in a 1–0 win at Elland Road.

Sirrel returned as manager in 1977, and Masson followed in 1978. In 1980–81, the Magpies finished as runners-up in the Second Division, and so won promotion to the First Division after a 55 year absence. Their first match back in top flight was away at Villa, the reigning league champions, and resulted in a 1–0 win for Notts. The Magpies had been a pre-season favourite for immediate relegation, but the team finished 15th, surviving comfortably despite losing 4 of their last 5 games. The 1982–83 season saw off-field changes, with Sirrel becoming &quot;club manager&quot; and Howard Wilkinson becoming &quot;team manager&quot;, and the team once again avoided the drop. Wilkinson moved to Sheffield Wednesday in 1983, replaced by Larry Lloyd; there was talk of the team being capable of qualifying for European competitions, but they were relegated back to the Second Division in 1984. 

Lloyd and his successor Richie Barker were both sacked before Sirrel once again took charge during the 1984–85 season; he could not prevent Notts from suffering a second consecutive relegation, but remained in post until May 1987. Notts were still a Third Division club in 1989, when they appointed Neil Warnock as manager. In 1989–90, his first full season in charge, Warnock led the Magpies to third place in the Third Division, and the team ultimately won promotion to the Second Division by beating Tranmere Rovers 2–0 in the Third Division play-off final, the club&#x27;s first ever match at Wembley Stadium. Notts returned to Wembley 12 months later, this time for the Second Division play-off final, and the team won consecutive promotions to the First Division by beating Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 3–1. Notts County&#x27;s return to the First Division was short lived, and they were relegated back to the second tier at the end of the 1991–92 season.

===Recent history===
Relegation meant that Notts County narrowly missed out on participating in the first season of the Premier League. Warnock departed in 1993, and the team was relegated to the Second Division (as the third tier was now known) in 1995, though they did also win the Anglo-Italian Cup that year. After losing the 1996 Second Division play-off final to Bradford City, the Magpies suffered a club-record 20 game winless run during 1996–97 and were consequently relegated to the Third Division. Under manager Sam Allardyce, Notts won the Third Division championship in 1997–98, becoming the first team since World War II to win promotion in March, and breaking several club records, including longest winning run (10 games). A 3–1 win at Bury on 9 October 1999 put the Magpies second in the Second Division, but Allardyce resigned shortly afterwards to become manager of Bolton, and Notts would ultimately finish the 1999–2000 season in eighth.

Beginning in the early 21st century, Notts County were beset by a series of serious off-field problems. Between 2002 and 2003, the club spent a record 534 days in administration and, although bankruptcy was avoided, the team were relegated to the fourth tier (shortly to be rechristened League Two) in 2004. They were still there in 2009, when the club was taken over by Munto Finance, purportedly a wealthy Middle East-based consortium who appointed former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson as director of football. In reality, Munto Finance was controlled by the convicted fraudster Russell King; the takeover had collapsed by December 2009, and Notts were left at risk of being wound up over unpaid debts. This was prevented in a further takeover by Ray Trew, and the 2009–10 season ended successfully, with the team winning the League Two championship. The Magpies remained in League One for five seasons before being relegated back to League Two in 2015.

Trew sold the club to Alan Hardy in December 2016. Notts reached the League Two play-off semi-finals in 2018, but Hardy put the club up for sale in January 2019 with the team bottom of the table. The Magpies ended the 2018–19 season relegated from the Football League for the first time in their history, before Hardy sold to Christoffer and Alexander Reedtz in July 2019. Notts lost the 2020 National League play-off final to Harrogate Town, and ultimately remained a National League club for three more years. In 2022–23, the Magpies amassed 107 points, but nevertheless the team finished four points behind Wrexham, their points tally setting a record for a team finishing second. Notts would eventually win promotion to League Two via the play-offs, defeating Chesterfield 4–3 in a penalty shootout in the 2023 National League play-off final following a 2–2 draw at Wembley Stadium.

==Club identity==
===Name and nicknames===
At the meeting to formally organise the club in December 1864, members passed a resolution establishing &quot;Notts Foot Ball Club&quot;, &quot;Notts&quot; being an abbreviation of Nottinghamshire. The club was variously described in its early days as Nottinghamshire, Nottingham, Notts or Notts Club; Warsop and Brown suggest that the name Notts County eventually arose from the need to distinguish the club from other local teams and (after 1882) the Nottinghamshire County Football Association. Notts County are the only English club whose proper name includes an abbreviation.

An 1883 &quot;Sheffield Daily Telegraph&quot; report, previewing a Nottingham derby between Notts and Forest, gives Notts County&#x27;s nickname as the &quot;Patricians&quot;. Before becoming the &quot;Magpies&quot;, Notts were known as the &quot;Lambs&quot;; Brown suggests this was a reference to a notorious gang from Nottingham&#x27;s Narrow Marsh slums active in the nineteenth century. After Notts adopted black and white striped shirts, they were quickly nicknamed the &quot;Magpies&quot;, though this continued to be used interchangeably with &quot;Lambs&quot; for some time. Warsop found one news report where both nicknames were used, and usage of the &quot;Lambs&quot; nickname by the press only petered out in the early 1900s.
===Colours and kits===

Notts wore blue caps in their match against Sheffield in January 1865. In February 1867, the &quot;Nottingham Guardian&quot; reported that Notts wore orange and black hoops in a game against Sheffield; this is the earliest known report of a team wearing a specially produced kit. In 1880, Notts adopted chocolate and blue halved shirts, which they wore until 1890, when black and white stripped shirts were first worn. With the exception of the 1934–35 season, when Notts briefly returned to chocolate and blue, black and white have remained the club&#x27;s colours since 1890. Black and white stripes have been the norm, though there has been some variation; in 1923, the team wore white shirts with a black chevron, during World War II, hoops were sometimes worn, and between 1946 and 1952, a white shirt with a black collar and cuffs was used.

At the end of 1901, Italian club Juventus were seeking to replace the pink shirts they had worn since their formation. John Savage, an English member of the Juventus team, arranged for a Notts-supporting friend in England to send a new set of kits to Turin, and Juventus have played in black and white stripes ever since. In September 2011, in recognition of the connection between the two clubs, Juventus invited Notts County to be their first opponents at the new Juventus Stadium.

===Crest===
A crest first appeared on Notts County&#x27;s shirts in 1923, coinciding with promotion to the First Division, when a magpie was depicted on the breast of the shirts. This lasted until 1926, when the club returned to the Second Division. From 1948, a large black shield with &quot;NCFC&quot; embroidered into it began appearing on shirts. This remained in place until 1950, when the club adopted a new crest with a magpie surmounted on a football surrounded by the club&#x27;s initials. However, the season began poorly and the Notts chairman, believing the magpie to be bringing the team bad luck, ordered the crest removed from the shirts. The team won their next match and the crest never returned. A crest based on Nottingham&#x27;s coat of arms was used from 1962, before a magpie reappeared on the shirts in 1977. A crest with two magpies has been the norm since 1986, with the current badge adopted in 2010. In the 2009–10 season, the club used a crest incorporating the logo of Swiss Commodity Holding, a company with close connections to Munto Finance, the consortium who made the abortive takeover of Notts during that season.

==Grounds==
===Early grounds===
The testimony of founding members indicates that, prior to the club&#x27;s formal organisation, they would meet at Park Hollow in The Park, Nottingham, to practice football amongst themselves. C.L. Rothera, an early club secretary, recalled being &quot;taken by my father to the Park, where he and his partner and a number of younger men, principally from the banks, met to kick a ball about, without any very definite rules.&quot; These meetings had moved to the Meadows Cricket Ground by 1863, the same ground that the club&#x27;s first organised matches took place on. The Meadows remained the club&#x27;s main home ground until October 1877, though the team occasionally played important fixtures, such as an 1873 match against a representative team from London, at Trent Bridge. In 1877, Notts moved home matches to the Gentlemen of Nottinghamshire Cricket Club&#x27;s ground in Beeston, and, between 1878 and 1880, the club split its games between the Meadows, Trent Bridge and Beeston. In 1880, Notts moved to the Castle Ground, where they remained until 1883.

===Trent Bridge===
Notts moved to Trent Bridge in 1883, taking over the tenancy from Forest. Football was played on the Fox Road side of the ground, and facilities were initially basic, with only a small stand at the Radcliffe Road end and the pavilion, the latter of which being some distance away from the football pitch. Later developments included a stand which Notts would take with them when they moved to Meadow Lane in 1910. Notts County&#x27;s record attendance at Trent Bridge was 25,000, reported for an FA Cup third round tie against Tottenham Hotspur in February 1907 and again for a First Division match against Everton in December 1908.

Cricket took priority at Trent Bridge, and Notts were consequently required to play early and late season fixtures at other grounds. Initially, they used the Meadows and the Castle Ground as alternative venues, but eventually they began using Forest&#x27;s grounds. Notts first used the Town Ground in 1895, and first played at the City Ground in 1899; they continued to use the latter as their alternative venue until 1908. In 1901, a row broke out when Stoke defeated Notts 4–2 at the City Ground, a result crucial to the former avoiding relegation. Other clubs argued that Stoke had gained an unfair advantage by not playing at Notts County&#x27;s main home venue, and in 1902 the Football League asked that Notts play all their home matches at one ground. Eventually, in 1908, the trustees of Trent Bridge decided not to renew the football club&#x27;s lease, giving them two years to find a new ground.

===Meadow Lane===
Notts leased land on Meadow Lane from Nottingham Corporation in 1910, and swiftly set about developing a new ground there. It opened on 3 September 1910, when Notts drew 1–1 with Forest before 27,000 spectators. Originally, a stream ran adjacent to the ground on its &quot;Leenside&quot;, and the club employed a man with a long pole and cane basket charged with retrieving the ball when it entered the water. In 1925, the stream was covered and the County Road stand was built. In 1941, during World War II, the ground was heavily damaged by bombing, forcing Notts to withdraw from wartime competition in the 1941–42 season. In 1949, 10 to 12 feet of height was added to the Spion Kop end of the ground to help accommodate the large crowds attending matches at that time.

The Meadow Lane end was demolished in 1978, to be replaced by a complex containing a social club, executive boxes and squash and tennis courts. In 1985, the pitch was shortened as spectators in the boxes were unable to see the goalmouth directly below them. Major redevelopment work to convert Meadow Lane into an all-seater stadium occurred in the 1990s, with three stands rebuilt during one summer in 1992. The original main stand stood until 1994 when it too was replaced. In 2019, the stadium held a maximum capacity of 19,841 spectators for football matches, with 20,211 seats overall. During the 2023–24 season, average attendance at the ground was 10,905, the third highest in League Two.

==Supporters and rivalries==
Supporters gained representation on the board of directors in 2003 through the Notts County Supporters&#x27; Trust. The Trust later gained a majority shareholding in the club, but in July 2009 Trust members were persuaded to transfer the shares to Munto Finance. Munto Finance&#x27;s takeover had collapsed by December 2009, and Notts County have been cited as an example of fan ownership of clubs gone awry. A 2007 survey declared Notts County as the most stressful team to support on account of its frequent on-field struggles and financial problems; the survey was still being cited in the press as relevant in 2023.

Notts County supporters are known to chant the &quot;Wheelbarrow Song&quot; to the tune of &quot;On Top of Old Smokey&quot;, consisting of the lyrics &quot;I had a wheelbarrow, the wheel fell off&quot;. In 1981, a group of supporters produced a record to mark the team&#x27;s promotion to the First Division; Noel Edmonds would later feature it on his BBC Radio 1 show in a competition to establish the worst record ever made. Fans produced various fanzines between the 1980s and the 2000s, the longest running of which was &quot;The Pie&quot;, which ran for 87 issues between 1987 and 2009. In 2024, the National Lottery Heritage Fund supported a project led by &quot;LeftLion&quot;, a Nottingham-based arts and culture magazine, to digitize and make available online all issues of &quot;The Pie&quot; and &quot;The Almighty Brian&quot;, its Forest counterpart.

Notts County first played their neighbours Nottingham Forest in March 1866, in Forest&#x27;s first ever match. This makes the Nottingham derby, as matches between the two clubs are known, one of football&#x27;s oldest fixtures. A team of 17 Forest players took on a Notts team of 11, and the match finished 0–0. In total, the teams have played each other in 94 league and cup matches, with Notts winning on 30 occasions, Forest 39 and with 25 draws. Competitive matches have grown rare; since 1957, the two clubs have been in the same division during only nine seasons, and a 2011 League Cup match, itself the first meeting of the two in 17 years, remains their most recent encounter. Notts County&#x27;s other local derby is with Mansfield Town, the two clubs most recently playing each other in the 2023–24 season.

==Statistics and records==

Goalkeeper Albert Iremonger holds the record for Notts County appearances, having played 601 matches for the club between 1904 and 1926, 564 coming in the league and 37 in the FA Cup. Iremonger also holds the record for consecutive appearances for Notts; he played in 222 straight matches between 1907 and 1912 until suspension brought this run to an end. A road adjacent to Notts County&#x27;s ground is named in his honour. Les Bradd is the club&#x27;s all-time leading goal scorer, having scored 137 goals between 1967 and 1978. The record for most goals scored for Notts in a single season is held by Macaulay Langstaff, who scored 42 goals for the Magpies in 2022–23.

Notts recorded their biggest winning margin on 24 October 1885, when they defeated Rotherham Town 15–0 in an FA Cup tie. Their record winning margin in the league is ten goals, accomplished in a 10–0 win over Burslem Port Vale in the Second Division on 26 February 1895 and again in an 11–1 win over Newport County in the Third Division South on 15 January 1949. The 2022–23 team broke several club records; it accumulated 107 points and won 32 league matches, surpassing the records of 99 points and 30 wins held respectively by its 1997–98 and 1970–71 counterparts. The 2022–23 team&#x27;s 117 league goals bettered the 1959–60 team&#x27;s tally of 107, and it went unbeaten for 25 league matches, surpassing a run of 19 league matches without defeat during 1930.

Notts County&#x27;s record home attendance was recorded on 12 March 1955, when the Magpies played York City of the Third Division North in an FA Cup quarter-final. The match was attended by 47,310 spectators, and was won 1–0 by the visitors. The record home attendance for a league game was the 46,000 who attended the Third Division South match with Forest on 22 April 1950. It was during the 1949–50 season that a record average crowd of 35,176 attended matches at Meadow Lane. Notts County also hold the record attendance for a National League game, set when 16,511 attended a 0–0 draw with Yeovil Town on 19 November 2022. The largest crowd that Notts County have ever played in front of was the 61,003 who attended an FA Cup tie against Liverpool at Anfield on 29 January 1949.

In total, Notts County have been promoted 14 times and relegated 17 times, and they have played in each of the top five divisions of English football. They were founder members of the Football League (and so the first tier) in 1888, first played in the second tier in 1893, the third tier in 1930, the fourth tier in 1959, and the fifth tier in 2019. Notts County&#x27;s highest overall league finish is third, first achieved in the 1890–91 season, and repeated ten seasons later in 1900–01. Notts played their 5,000th Football League match in October 2023, becoming the eighth club to reach that milestone. Before relegation to non-League football in 2019, the Magpies had played the most Football League matches of any club, but they were overtaken by Preston North End in January 2020.

==Ownership and finances==
Notts County became a limited company in 1890 under the legal name of the Notts. Incorporated Football Club. Buoyed by the team&#x27;s third place finish and run to the FA Cup final in 1890–91, the club made plans to open a billiard room and clubhouse on Nottingham&#x27;s Thurland Street. However, attendances would fall and this, combined with an increase to the salaries of players after the FA Cup run, left Notts in a poor financial state. When the team were relegated at the end of the 1892–93 season, the chairman and four directors resigned, and the club considered declining to play in the Second Division in favour of the Midland Football League, which would provide more local derbies. This ultimately did not happen, and the club&#x27;s financial position improved following its win in the 1894 FA Cup final.

In 1928, the chairman Henry Heath described Notts County&#x27;s finances as &quot;the worst in the club&#x27;s history&quot;. In an effort to resolve the situation, the directors decided to wind up the old company and replace it with a new one, Notts County Football Club Ltd. The plan required the sale £20,000 of shares, but the public response to the share issue was poor, and the Notts. Incorporated Football Club had been reinstated by October 1928. A new share issue was made in 1966, a year after the club had been at serious risk of closure; the board of directors had decided that the club could not continue, but an investment of £10,000 from Nottingham businessman Bill Hopcroft ensured the Magpies survived. In 1968, Jack Dunnett, a local MP, became Notts County&#x27;s chairman. Dunnett also served as President of the Football League during his tenure, being elected to that position in 1981, shortly after Notts County&#x27;s promotion to the First Division.

By 1986, Notts had a deficit of £1.8m and the club&#x27;s future was once again in question. A crisis meeting attended by 1,500 supporters (with others locked outside) was held at Nottingham&#x27;s Astoria nightclub in September 1986, where the board of directors presented a blueprint to salvage the situation. The result was the launch of &quot;Lifeline&quot;, a scheme to raise funds for the club which still operates. Derek Pavis became chairman in 1987; during his tenure, the club collected several large transfer fees for its players, including for Tommy Johnson and Craig Short, and Meadow Lane saw significant redevelopment. Pavis remained in charge until 2000, when he made a deal to sell his shares to the American businessman Albert Scardino.

Notts invested significant sums of money in its squad in an effort to win promotion to the First Division (now the EFL Championship) while Scardino attempted to secure loans to fund his takeover. The team instead narrowly avoided relegation to the Third Division (now EFL League Two) in the 2001–02 season, and soon afterwards, with no loans forthcoming, Scardino placed the Magpies into administration. After a protracted period in administration, bankruptcy was avoided in a takeover largely financed by supporter Haydn Green; the Notts County Supporters&#x27; Trust also gained representation on the board of directors as part of the agreement. In 2007, shortly before his death, Green sold his shares in the club to the Trust, making the latter majority shareholder.

The Trust grew unpopular, and in 2009 it handed over control of the club to Munto Finance, purportedly a wealthy Middle East-based consortium. Sven-Göran Eriksson, who was appointed director of football soon after Munto Finance&#x27;s takeover, stated his ambition was to see the Magpies promoted to the Premier League, and the club began to spend lavishly. In August 2009, Notts signed goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel from Manchester City for an undisclosed fee believed to surpass the club record. Soon afterwards, they signed England international Sol Campbell on a contract reportedly worth £40,000 per week. In reality, the takeover had been orchestrated by the convicted fraudster Russell King as part of a complex plot to list a fake mining company on the stock exchange, and the promised money did not exist. King fled when his scheme collapsed, resulting in a management buyout, and the club at risk of being wound-up over unpaid debts.

Bankruptcy was avoided in a further takeover by Ray Trew; Eriksson left as a result of this, writing off £2.5million owed to him by the club. Trew remained chairman until February 2016, when he stepped down and put the club up for sale, citing &quot;foul and mindless&quot; abuse from fans as his reason for doing so. The club were subject to winding-up petitions over unpaid taxes, before Trew sold the club to Alan Hardy in December 2016. In turn, Hardy would make the club available for sale in January 2019. Notts were once again issued with winding-up petitions, and staff went without pay for two months, before a sale to Christoffer and Alexander Reedtz was agreed in July 2019. Their ownership has coincided with increased attendance, and seen the completion of infrastructure projects such as &quot;The Nest&quot;, a former factory adjacent to Meadow Lane converted for use as a &quot;fanzone&quot;.

==Notts County in the media==
In 1959, Colin Slater began reporting on Notts County for the &quot;Nottingham Evening News&quot;, his first match covered being a 2–1 win for the Magpies over Chester. He became BBC Radio Nottingham&#x27;s Notts County correspondent in 1968, first reporting for the station on a 5–0 defeat to Lincoln City, and reported or commentated on more than 2,500 matches before retiring, his final game covered coming against Newport in May 2017. Slater became strongly identified with the club, known as &quot;the voice of Notts County&quot;. Slater died in January 2022; before his funeral, his cortege visited Meadow Lane, where it was given a guard of honour by dozens of Notts supporters.

In 2002, the BBC broadcast &quot;Paradise Heights&quot;, a drama series set in Nottingham. Ralph Little&#x27;s character was a Notts County fan, and Little was required to sing the &quot;Wheelbarrow Song&quot;. In 2003, journalist David McVay published &quot;Steak…Diana Ross: Diary of a Football Nobody&quot;, recounting his time as a Magpies player in the 1970s. In 2012, playwright William Ivory, a Notts County supporter, wrote a play based on McVay&#x27;s book, which ran at the Nottingham Playhouse. During the 2022–23 season, Notts County were involved in an intense race with Wrexham for the National League&#x27;s championship and its solitary automatic promotion place. As a result, Notts featured in the FX television show &quot;Welcome to Wrexham&quot;, documenting the actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney&#x27;s takeover of Wrexham.

==Managers==

For the first half century of the club&#x27;s existence, the team was selected by committee. Even when Albert Fisher was appointed Notts County&#x27;s first recognised manager in 1913, his team selections were initially subject to committee approval. Fisher remained in charge until 1927, his 14-year tenure the longest of any Notts manager, during which time the Magpies twice won promotion from the Second Division and reached an FA Cup semi-final. Fisher was succeeded by Horace Henshall, who signed Tom Keetley and oversaw promotion from the Third Division South in 1931.

After World War II, Arthur Stollery was appointed manager. Stollery had previously been a trainer at Chelsea where he worked with Tommy Lawton, and Stollery played a key part in convincing Lawton to join the Magpies. Stollery resigned for health reasons in 1949, and it was ultimately under his successor Eric Houghton that Notts won promotion from the Third Division South. Lawton himself would manage the team in the 1950s, but his tenure was unsuccessful and ended in his sacking. Frank Hill led the Magpies to promotion from the Fourth Division in 1960 and introduced Tony Hateley into the team, while Jeff Astle first played under Hill&#x27;s successor Ernie Coleman.

Jimmy Sirrel had three spells as manager between 1969 and 1987, during which the Magpies won promotion from the Fourth, Third and Second Division. Sirrel is regarded as Notts County&#x27;s greatest manager; a stand at Meadow Lane is named in his honour, and a statue of him and his assistant Jack Wheeler can be found near the ground, as can a mural of Sirrel with his Forest counterpart Brian Clough. Neil Warnock was appointed manager in 1989, and he oversaw successive promotions from the Third to First Division via the play-offs and a single season in the top flight. By 1997, the Magpies were in the Third Division (the fourth tier, now League Two), and Sam Allardyce led them to the divisional title.

Notts began the 2009–10 season under the leadership of Ian McParland before he was sacked in October 2009, and his replacement Hans Backe lasted only seven games before his resignation in December 2009. It was under Backe&#x27;s eventual successor Steve Cotterill that the Magpies clinched the League Two championship. Cotterill could not be persuaded to remain at the club at the end of the title-winning season, and there were frequent changes of manager under Ray Trew&#x27;s chairmanship, contributing to instability and disillusionment among fans. By 2019, Notts were a non-League club; it was under head coach Luke Williams that the Magpies returned to the Football League in 2023. The club&#x27;s current head coach is Stuart Maynard, who was appointed to the role in January 2024.

==Honours==
Notts County have won two cup competitions in their history; the FA Cup in the 1893–94 season, and the Anglo-Italian Cup in the 1994–95 season. Notts have won eight league titles in total; they have been second tier champions three times, third tier champions twice, and fourth tier champions three times. Their most recent championship was the League Two title won in the 2009–10 season. Notts have won six other promotions, most recently by beating Chesterfield in the 2023 National League play-off final.

<text>The Georgians, or Kartvelians (; , ), are a nation and Caucasian ethnic group native to present-day Georgia and surrounding areas historically associated with the Georgian kingdoms. Significant Georgian diaspora communities are also present throughout Russia, Turkey, Greece, Iran, Ukraine, the United States, and the European Union.

Georgians arose from Colchian and Iberian civilizations of classical antiquity; Colchis was interconnected with the Hellenic world, whereas Iberia was influenced by the Achaemenid Empire until Alexander the Great conquered it. In the early 4th century, the Georgians became one of the first to embrace Christianity and now the majority of Georgians are Orthodox Christians, with most following their national Georgian Orthodox Church, although there are small Georgian Catholic and Muslim communities as well as a significant number of irreligious Georgians. Located in the Caucasus, on the continental crossroads of Europe and Asia, the High Middle Ages saw Georgian people form a unified Kingdom of Georgia in 1008 AD, the pan-Caucasian empire, later inaugurating the Georgian Golden Age, a height of political and cultural power of the nation. This lasted until the kingdom was weakened and later disintegrated as the result of the 13th–15th-century invasions of the Mongols and Timur, the Black Death, the Fall of Constantinople, as well as internal divisions following the death of George V the Brilliant in 1346, the last of the great kings of Georgia.

Thereafter and throughout the early modern period, Georgians became politically fractured and were dominated by the Ottoman Empire and successive dynasties of Iran. Georgians started looking for allies and found the Russians on the political horizon as a possible replacement for the lost Byzantine Empire, &quot;for the sake of the Christian faith&quot;. The Georgian kings and Russian tsars exchanged no less than 17 embassies, which culminated in 1783, when Heraclius II of the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti forged an alliance with the Russian Empire. The Russo-Georgian alliance, however, backfired as Russia was unwilling to fulfill the terms of the treaty, proceeding to annex the troubled kingdom in 1801 as well as the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti in 1810. There were several uprisings and movements to restore the statehood, the most notable being the 1832 plot, which collapsed in failure. Eventually, Russian rule over Georgia was acknowledged in various peace treaties with Iran and the Ottomans, and the remaining Georgian territories were absorbed by the Russian Empire in a piecemeal fashion through the course of the 19th century. Georgians briefly reasserted their independence from Russia under the First Georgian Republic from 1918 to 1921 and finally in 1991 from the Soviet Union.

The Georgian nation was formed out of a diverse set of geographic subgroups, each with its characteristic traditions, manners, dialects and, in the case of Svans and Mingrelians, own regional languages. The Georgian language, with its own unique writing system and extensive written tradition, which goes back to the 5th century, is the official language of Georgia as well as the language of education of all Georgians living in the country. According to the State Ministry on Diaspora Issues of Georgia, unofficial statistics say that there are more than 5 million Georgians in the world.

==Etymology==
Georgians call themselves &quot;Kartveli&quot; (, &quot;pl.&quot; &quot;Kartvelebi&quot; ), their land &quot;Sakartvelo&quot; (), and their language &quot;Kartuli&quot; (). According to &quot;The Georgian Chronicles&quot;, the ancestor of the Kartvelian people was Kartlos, the great-grandson of the Biblical Japheth. However, scholars agree that the word is derived from the &quot;Karts&quot;, the latter being one of the proto-Georgian tribes that emerged as a dominant group in ancient times. &quot;Kart&quot; probably is cognate with Indo-European &quot;gard&quot; and denotes people who live in a &quot;fortified citadel&quot;. Ancient Greeks (Homer, Herodotus, Strabo, Plutarch etc.) and Romans (Titus Livius, Cornelius Tacitus, etc.) referred to western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians.

The term &quot;Georgians&quot; is derived from the country of Georgia. In the past, lore-based theories were given by the medieval French traveller Jacques de Vitry, who explained the name&#x27;s origin by the popularity of St. George amongst Georgians, while traveller Jean Chardin thought that &quot;Georgia&quot; came from Greek (&quot;tiller of the land&quot;), as when the Greeks came into the region (in Colchis) they encountered a developed agricultural society.

However, as Alexander Mikaberidze adds, these explanations for the word &quot;Georgians/Georgia&quot; are rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the Persian word &quot;gurğ/gurğān&quot; (&quot;wolf&quot;) as the root of the word. Starting with the Persian word &quot;gurğ/gurğān&quot;, the word was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages. This term itself might have been established through the ancient Iranian appellation of the near-Caspian region, which was referred to as &quot;Gorgan&quot; (&quot;land of the wolves&quot;).

==History==
Most historians and scholars of Georgia as well as anthropologists, archaeologists, and linguists tend to agree that the ancestors of modern Georgians inhabited the southern Caucasus and northern Anatolia since the Neolithic period. Scholars usually refer to them as Proto-Kartvelian (Proto-Georgians such as Colchians and Iberians) tribes.

The Georgian people in antiquity have been known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as &quot;Colchians&quot; and &quot;Iberians&quot;. East Georgian tribes of Tibarenians-Iberians formed their kingdom in 7th century BCE. However, western Georgian tribes (Colchian tribes) established the first Georgian state of Colchis () before the foundation of the Kingdom of Iberia in the east. According to the numerous scholars of Georgia, the formations of these two early Georgian kingdoms of Colchis and Iberia, resulted in the consolidation and uniformity of the Georgian nation.

According to Cyril Toumanoff, scholar of the Caucasian studies, the Moschians also were one of the early proto-Georgian tribes which were integrated into the first early Georgian state of Iberia.
The ancient Jewish chronicle by Josephus mentions Georgians as Iberes who were also called Thobel (Tubal). David Marshall Lang argued that the root &quot;Tibar&quot; gave rise to the form &quot;Iber&quot; that made the Greeks pick up the name &quot;Iberian&quot; in the end for the designation of the eastern Georgians.

Diauehi in Assyrian sources and Taochi in Greek lived in the northeastern part of Anatolia. This ancient tribe is considered by many scholars as ancestors of the Georgians. Modern Georgians still refer to this region, which now belongs to present-day Turkey, as Tao-Klarjeti, an ancient Georgian kingdom. Some people there still speak the Georgian language.

Colchians in the ancient western Georgian polity of Colchis were another proto-Georgian tribe. They are first mentioned in the Assyrian annals of Tiglath-Pileser I and in the annals of Urartian king Sarduri II, and also included western Georgian tribe of the Meskhetians.

Iberians, also known as Tiberians or Tiberanians, lived in the eastern Georgian kingdom of Iberia.

Both Colchians and Iberians played an important role in the ethnic and cultural formation of the modern Georgian nation.

According to the scholar of the Caucasian studies Cyril Toumanoff:

==Genetics==

An FTDNA collection of Georgian Y-DNA suggests that Georgians have the highest percentage of Haplogroup G (39.9%) among the general population recorded in any country. Georgians&#x27; Y-DNA also belongs to Haplogroup J (32.5%), R1b (8.6%), L (5.4%), R1a (4.2%), I2 (3.8%) and other more minor haplogroups such as E, T and Q.

==Culture==

===Language and linguistic subdivisions===

Georgian is the primary language for Georgians of all provenance, including those who speak other Kartvelian languages: Svans, Mingrelians and the Laz. The language known today as Georgian is a traditional language of the eastern part of the country which has spread to most of the present-day Georgia after the post-Christianization centralization in the first millennium CE. Today, Georgians regardless of their ancestral region use Georgian as their official language. The regional languages Svan and Mingrelian are languages of the west that were traditionally spoken in the pre-Christian Kingdom of Colchis, but later lost importance as the unified Kingdom of Georgia emerged. Their decline is largely due to the capital of the unified kingdom, Tbilisi, being in the eastern part of the country known as Kingdom of Iberia effectively making the language of the east an official language of the Georgian monarch.

All of these languages comprise the Kartvelian language family along with the related language of the Laz people, which has speakers in both Turkey and Georgia.

Georgian dialects include Imeretian, Racha-Lechkhumian, Gurian, Adjarian, Imerkhevian (in Turkey), Kartlian, Kakhetian, Ingilo (in Azerbaijan), Tush, Khevsur, Mokhevian, Pshavian, Fereydan dialect in Iran in Fereydunshahr and Fereydan, Mtiuletian, Meskhetian and Javakhetian dialect.

===Religion===
According to Orthodox tradition, Christianity was first preached in Georgia by the Apostles Simon and Andrew in the 1st century. It became the state religion of Kartli (Iberia) in 319 or 326. At the same time, in the first centuries A.D., the cult of Mithras, pagan beliefs, and Zoroastrianism were commonly practiced in Georgia. The conversion of Kartli to Christianity is credited to St. Nino of Cappadocia. Christianity gradually replaced all the former religions except Zoroastrianism, which become a second established religion in Iberia after the Peace of Acilisene in 378. The conversion to Christianity eventually placed the Georgians permanently on the front line of conflict between the Islamic and Christian world. Georgians remained mostly Christian despite repeated invasions by Muslim powers, and long episodes of foreign domination.

As was true elsewhere, the Christian church in Georgia was crucial to the development of a written language, and most of the earliest written works were religious texts. Medieval Georgian culture was greatly influenced by Eastern Orthodoxy and the Georgian Orthodox Church, which promoted and often sponsored the creation of many works of religious devotion. These included churches and monasteries, works of art such as icons, and hagiographies of Georgian saints.

Today, 83.9% of the Georgian population, most of whom are ethnic Georgian, follow Eastern Orthodox Christianity. A sizable Georgian Muslim population exists in Adjara. This autonomous Republic borders Turkey, and was part of the Ottoman Empire for a longer amount of time than other parts of the country. Those Georgian Muslims practice the Sunni Hanafi form of Islam. Islam has however declined in Adjara during the 20th century, due to Soviet anti-religious policies, cultural integration with the national Orthodox majority, and strong missionary efforts by the Georgian Orthodox Church. In the early modern period, converted Georgian recruits were often used by the Persian and Ottoman Empires for elite military units such as the Mameluks, Qizilbash, and ghulams. The Iranian Georgians are all reportedly Shia Muslims today, while Ingiloy (indigenous to Azerbaijan), Laz (indigenous to Turkey), Imerkhevians (indigenous to Turkey), and Georgians in Turkey (who descend from Georgian immigrants) are mostly Sunni Muslim.

There is also a small number of Georgian Jews, tracing their ancestors to the Babylonian captivity.

In addition to traditional religious confessions, Georgia retains irreligious segments of society, as well as a significant portion of nominally religious individuals who do not actively practice their faith.
===Cuisine===

The Georgian cuisine is specific to the country, but also contains some influences from other European culinary traditions, as well as those from the surrounding Western Asia. Each historical province of Georgia has its own distinct culinary tradition, such as Megrelian, Kakhetian, and Imeretian cuisines. In addition to various meat dishes, Georgian cuisine also offers a variety of vegetarian meals.

The importance of both food and drink to Georgian culture is best observed during a Caucasian feast, or &quot;supra&quot;, when a huge assortment of dishes is prepared, always accompanied by large amounts of wine, and dinner can last for hours. In a Georgian feast, the role of the &quot;tamada&quot; (toastmaster) is an important and honoured position.

In countries of the former Soviet Union, Georgian food is popular due to the immigration of Georgians to other Soviet republics, in particular Russia. In Russia all major cities have many Georgian restaurants and Russian restaurants often feature Georgian food items on their menu.

==Geographic subdivisions and subethnic groups==
===Geographical subdivisions===
The Georgians have historically been classified into various subgroups based on the geographic region which their ancestors traditionally inhabited.

Even if a member of any of these subgroups moves to a different region, they will still be known by the name of their ancestral region. For example, if a Gurian moves to Tbilisi (part of the Kartli region) he will not automatically identify himself as Kartlian despite actually living in Kartli. This may, however, change if substantial amount of time passes. For example, there are some Mingrelians who have lived in the Imereti region for centuries and are now identified as Imeretian or Imeretian-Mingrelians.

Last names from mountainous eastern Georgian provinces (such as Kakheti, etc.) can be distinguished by the suffix –&quot;uri&quot; (ური), or –&quot;uli&quot; (ული). Most Svan last names typically end in –&quot;ani&quot; (ანი), Mingrelian in –&quot;ia&quot; (ია), -&quot;ua&quot; (უა), or -&quot;ava&quot; (ავა), and Laz in –&quot;shi&quot; (ში).

The 1897 Russian census (which accounted people by language), had Imeretian, Svan and Mingrelian languages separate from Georgian.
During the 1926 Soviet census, Svans and Mingrelians were accounted separately from Georgian.
Svan and Mingrelian languages are both Kartvelian languages and are closely related to the national Georgian language.

====Outside modern Georgia====

Laz people also may be considered Georgian based on their geographic location and religion. According to the London School of Economics&#x27; anthropologist Mathijs Pelkmans, Lazs residing in Georgia frequently identify themselves as &quot;first-class Georgians&quot; to show pride, while considering their Muslim counterparts in Turkey as &quot;Turkified Lazs&quot;.

====Extinct Georgian subdivisions====
Throughout history Georgia also has extinct Georgian subdivisions

<text>Washington-on-the-Brazos is an unincorporated community along the Brazos River in Washington County, Texas, United States. The town is best known for being the site of the Convention of 1836 and the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence.

The town is named for Washington, Georgia, itself named for George Washington. It is officially known as just &quot;Washington,&quot; but after the Civil War came to be known as &quot;Washington-on-the-Brazos&quot; to distinguish the settlement from &quot;Washington-on-the-Potomac,&quot; Washington, D.C..

==History==
Washington was founded in 1833 by John W. Hall, one of the Old Three Hundred settlers, on land he had been given two years before by his father-in-law Andrew Robinson. It was located at a ferry crossing over the Brazos River on the La Bahia Road that dated from 1821.

As the town grew, most settlers were immigrants from the Southern United States, in what was then Mexican Texas. Because of its location on the Brazos River and near major roads, Washington became a commercial center, drawing in new inhabitants from nearby areas. After the outbreak of the Texas Revolution, General Sam Houston made his headquarters at Washington in December 1835.

Washington-on-the-Brazos is known as &quot;the birthplace of Texas&quot; because, on March 1, 1836, Texas delegates met in the town to formally announce Texas&#x27; intention to separate from Mexico and to draft a constitution for the new Republic of Texas. They organized an interim government to serve until a permanent one could be formed.

The delegates adopted the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836, signing it on the following day. They adopted their constitution on March 16. The delegates worked until March 17, when they had to flee with the residents of Washington, to escape the advancing Mexican Army. The townspeople returned after the Mexican Army was defeated at San Jacinto on April 21. Town leaders lobbied for Washington&#x27;s designation as the permanent capital of the Republic of Texas, but leaders of the Republic favored Waterloo, later renamed Austin.

Washington County was established by the legislature of the Republic of Texas in 1836 and organized in 1837, when Washington-on-the-Brazos was designated as the county seat. Although the county seat moved to Brenham in 1844, the town continued to thrive as a center for the cotton trade until the mid-1850s, as it was located on the Brazos River to use for shipping out the crop. The construction of railroads bypassed the town and pulled off its businesses. The strife of the Civil War took another toll on the town, and by the turn of the 20th century, it was virtually abandoned.

The Washington American, an organ of the American (Know Nothing) party, was published there in 1855 and 1856.

==Culture==
The town is home to the Washington-on-the-Brazos Historical Site, which has three main attractions: The Star of the Republic Museum (a museum about the Texas Republic), a replica of Independence Hall (where the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed), and Barrington Plantation (home of last Texas Republic President Anson Jones). In 1899, the local schools created a monument to Independence Hall.

The town is also home to Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church, founded in 1849 as the oldest Black Catholic church in Texas.

Washington Avenue in Houston is named for Washington-on-the-Brazos and is the western route to Washington County.

==Geography==
Washington-on-the-Brazos is located on Farm to Market Road 912 off Texas State Highway 105, east of Brenham and west of Navasota in the upper northeastern corner of Washington County. It is near the intersection of the Brazos and Navasota rivers.

==Education==
The first school in the community may have been established by the wife of John Hall in 1837. In 1841, local Masonic Lodge created its own school, and the Washington Female Academy briefly existed from 1856 to 1857. There were two schools in the 1930s, segregated according to race. Today, the community is served by the Brenham Independent School District.

<doc id="448616" wikidata="Q81690" url="?curid=448616" title="Dogger Bank incident">
<text>The Dogger Bank incident (also known as the North Sea Incident, the Russian Outrage or the Incident of Hull) occurred on the night of 21/22 October 1904, when the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy mistook civilian British fishing trawlers from Kingston upon Hull in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea for Imperial Japanese Navy torpedo boats and fired on them, also firing on each other in the chaos of the melée. 

Two British fishermen died, six more were injured, one fishing vessel was sunk, and five more boats were damaged. On the Russian side, one sailor and a Russian Orthodox priest aboard the cruiser &quot;Aurora&quot; were killed by friendly fire. &quot;Damage to the &quot;Aurora&quot; was concealed ... and only discovered by the deciphering of a wireless message intercepted at [the British] Felixstowe station. It was also considered highly significant that no officer from that ship appeared before the Commission, nor were their logs produced.&quot; The incident almost led to war between the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire.
==Prelude==
The Russian warships involved in the incident were en route to the Far East to reinforce the 1st Pacific Squadron stationed at Port Arthur and later Vladivostok during the Russo-Japanese War. The various Russian intelligence agencies were not well coordinated and were prone to producing poor or false reports Prior to the fleet setting off Russian intelligence agents had been claiming that there were Japanese officers around the Baltic sea with torpedoes and that Britain had built Japan six torpedo boats.

Because of the fleet&#x27;s alleged sightings of balloons and four enemy cruisers the day previously, coupled with &quot;the possibility that the Japanese might surreptitiously have sent ships around the world to attack&quot; them, Russian Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky called for increased vigilance and issued an order that &quot;no vessel of any sort must be allowed to get in among the fleet&quot;.
It was known that enemy intelligence had been heavily active in the region. Torpedo boats, a recent development of the major navies, had the potential to damage and sink large warships and were very difficult to detect, which caused psychological stress to sailors at war.

On 20 October Rozhestvensky received a report from Arcadiy Harting that torpedo boats had been seen leaving Norway. He also received an intelligence report from the Russian transport &quot;Bakan&quot; in the Langeland Belt of &quot;four torpedo-boats which only showed lights on the mizenmast-head so that at a distance, they might be taken for fishing boats&quot;. He took the report seriously, quickened his coaling and commenced sailing.

Similar accidents and rumours affected the Russian fleet. There was a general fear of attack, with widespread rumours that a fleet of Japanese torpedo boats were stationed off the Danish coast, talk of the Japanese having mined the seas and alleged sightings of Japanese submarines. Before the Dogger Bank incident, the nervous Russian fleet had fired on fishermen carrying consular dispatches from Russia to them near the Danish coast. No damage was caused because of the Russian fleet&#x27;s poor gunnery.

After navigating a non-existent minefield, the Russian fleet sailed into the North Sea. The disaster of 21 October began in the evening, when the captain of the supply ship &quot;Kamchatka&quot; (Камчатка), which was last in the Russian line, took a passing Swedish ship for a Japanese torpedo boat and radioed that he was being attacked.

==Incident==
On 22 October 0:55am, during fog, Rozhestvensky spotted unlit boats. He ordered a change of direction and the use of searchlights on the ships. The Russian warships illuminated the trawlers with their searchlights. Very shortly there after Rozhestvensky believed he saw a torpedo boat and ordered the ship open fire. 

As the trawlers had their nets down, they were unable to flee. The British trawler &quot;Crane&quot; was sunk, and its captain and boatswain were killed. Four other trawlers were damaged, and six other fishermen were wounded, one of whom died a few months later.

In the general chaos, Russian ships began to shoot at each other. The cruisers &quot;Aurora&quot; and &quot;Dmitrii Donskoi&quot; were taken for Japanese warships and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing a chaplain and at least one sailor and severely wounding another. During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signalled torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship &quot;Borodino&quot;, rumours spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crews donning life vests and lying prone on the deck and others drawing cutlasses. More serious losses to both sides were avoided only because of the extremely low quality of Russian gunnery, with the battleship &quot;Oryol&quot; reportedly firing more than 500 shells without hitting anything.

After ten minutes of gunfire, the fishermen finally saw a blue light signal on one of the warships, the order to cease firing.

== Aftermath ==
The incident led to a serious diplomatic conflict between Russia and Britain, which was particularly dangerous because of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. In the aftermath, some British newspapers called the Russian fleet &#x27;pirates&#x27;, and Admiral Rozhestvensky was heavily criticised for not leaving the British fishermen lifeboats. The editorial of the morning&#x27;s &quot;Times&quot; was particularly scathing: 

The Royal Navy prepared for war, with 28 battleships of the Home Fleet being ordered to raise steam and prepare for action, while British cruiser squadrons shadowed the Russian fleet as it made its way through the Bay of Biscay and down the coast of Portugal. Rozhestvensky initial defence in part relied on reports by some of the fishermen that they had had seen a torpedo destroyer loitering in the area until dawn. Since the Russian fleet did not contain such a vessel he argued it must have been a Japanese torpedo boat. The British dismissed this claim suggesting if they had seen anything it was the Kamchatka although they did perform quiet enquires of the navies in the area to rule them out. No non Russian warship has ever been identified as being in the area and it&#x27;s unclear what, if anything, the fishermen saw. 

Under diplomatic pressure, the Russian government agreed to investigate the incident, and Rozhestvensky was ordered to dock in Vigo, Spain, where he left behind those officers considered responsible (as well as at least one officer who had been critical of him) before leaving on 1 November.

From Vigo, the main Russian fleet then approached Tangiers, Morocco, and lost contact with the &quot;Kamchatka&quot; for several days. The &quot;Kamchatka&quot; eventually rejoined the fleet and claimed that she had engaged three Japanese warships and fired over 300 shells. The ships she had actually fired at were a Swedish merchantman, a German trawler, and a French schooner. As the fleet left Tangiers on 5 November, one ship accidentally severed the city&#x27;s underwater telegraph cable with her anchor, preventing communications with Europe for four days. The British Government sent instructions to the Royal Navy that crisis had come to an end on 11 November.

Concerns that the draught of the newer battleships, which had proven to be considerably greater than designed, would prevent their passage through the Suez Canal caused the fleet to separate after leaving Tangiers on 3 November 1904. These concerns though may have been a excuse to hide worries over passing through British controlled waters. The newer battleships and a few cruisers proceeded around the Cape of Good Hope under Rozhestvensky while the older battleships and lighter cruisers passed through the Suez Canal under the command of Admiral Dmitry Gustavovich von Fölkersahm. Both sections of the fleet then rendezvoused at Madagascar as planned. The fleet then proceeded to the Sea of Japan, where it was soundly defeated in the Battle of Tsushima.

On 25 November 1904, the British and the Russian governments signed a joint agreement in which they agreed to submit the issue to an international commission of inquiry whose proceedings were to be based on the Hague Convention. The International Commission met in Paris from 9 January to 25 February 1905. The report produced by the International Commission concluded that &quot;the commissioners declare that their findings, which are therein formulated, are not, in their opinion, of a nature to cast any discredit upon the military qualities or the humanity of Admiral Rojdestvensky, or of the personnel of his squadron&quot;. It also concluded that &quot;the commissioners take pleasure in recognising, unanimously, that Admiral Rozhestvensky personally did everything he could, from beginning to end of the incident, to prevent trawlers, recognised as such, from being fired upon by the squadron&quot;.

Russia voluntarily paid compensation of £66,000 to the fishermen. In 1906 the Fisherman&#x27;s Memorial was unveiled in Hull to commemorate the deaths of the three British sailors. The memorial, approximately 18 feet high, shows the dead fisherman George Henry Smith and carries the following inscription:

<text>The Former Liang (; 301–376) was a dynastic state, and one of the Sixteen Kingdoms, in Chinese history. It was founded by Zhang Shi of the Han Chinese Zhang family. Its territories included present-day Gansu and parts of Ningxia, Shaanxi, Qinghai and Xinjiang.

All rulers of the Former Liang remained largely titularly under the court of the Eastern Jin dynasty as the Duke of Xiping except Zhang Zuo who proclaimed himself emperor (or king). However, at times the other Former Liang rulers also used the king title when imposed on them when they were forced to submit to their powerful neighbour states—initially the Former Zhao, then the Later Zhao, and finally the Former Qin. As the early rulers did not explicitly declare their independence, the official year of Former Liang&#x27;s establishment is up to interpretation, but no earlier than 301, the year when Zhang Gui was appointed Inspector of Liang province. Historiographers gave the state the prefix of &quot;Former&quot; to distinguish it from the Di-led Later Liang that came after them, along with the other Liang states of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Southern Liang, Northern Liang and Western Liang.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The founding of the Former Liang can be traced back to Zhang Gui. He was a Han Chinese official under the Western Jin dynasty who claimed descent from Zhang Er, the King of Changsha during Emperor Gaozu of Han’s era. Zhang Gui was appointed as provincial inspector by the imperial court in 301.

Along with his two sons, Zhang Mao and Zhang Shi, he made Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) his main base and worked closely with the local population to ensure the dynastic rule of his family. Due to the stability in the area, Former Liang became a refuge for those fleeing the chaos of the heartland. Zhang Gui also developed the region by promoting agriculture and establishing new schools. Despite his influence in Liang, Zhang Gui never declared independence and remained a Jin official up to his death in 314. Likewise, his successors for the most part nominally retained their status as Jin officials, maintaining their legitimacy by maintaining ties with the Jin court. As a result of the migration of refugees from the collapsing Western Jin, there was an influx of literati who fled to Former Liang rather than the Jin court-in-exile in the south, which resulted in the Former Liang becoming a cultural center of North China.

=== Early years ===
Zhang Gui aided the Western Jin in its war against the Xiongnu-led Han dynasty (renamed to Former Zhao in 319), as did his son and successor Zhang Shi. After Emperor Min of Jin’s capture and execution, Zhang Shi sent envoys to the prince, Sima Rui at Jiankang in the south, urging him to take the throne. The dynasty was re-established as the Eastern Jin in 318, but despite his endorsement, Zhang Shi refused to adopt Sima Rui’s new reign era. Instead, he continued to use Emperor Min’s reign era, &quot;Jianxing&quot; (建興) within his territory, a practice that was upheld by most of his successors. Zhang Shi is considered the de facto founder of the Former Liang, establishing Guzang as its capital in 317.

After Zhang Shi&#x27;s assassination in 320, his brother, Zhang Mao took power. He came into conflict with the Former Zhao, who were expanding westward to compete with their rival Later Zhao. In 323, Zhang Mao submitted to the Former Zhao, receiving the title of King of Liang and the nine bestowments, while internally retaining his Jin title of Duke of Xiping.

=== Reign of Zhang Jun ===
The Former Liang reached its peak under Zhang Jun, who succeeded his uncle Zhang Mao in 324. After the Later Zhao conquered Former Zhao in 329, he rejected Later Zhao&#x27;s authority at first, but was eventually pressured into submission. Regardless, in 335 his forces marched across the sands and expanded his territory, forcing several oasis states in the Western Regions like Kucha to submit to him. In the mid-fourth century, it is believed that Former Liang could have maintained control over much of modern day Gansu and Xinjiang, as well as portions of Qinghai and Ningxia. Zhang Jun also established ties with the Cheng-Han dynasty in southwestern China.

Under him, the Former Liang began to use the ranks and titles of the imperial court, as well as imitating the flag, trappings, and carriage of the Emperor roughly twenty-one years into his reign. His state&#x27;s immense wealth was exemplified by his extravagant building projects, most notably the five palaces he built south of Guzang. In 345, he proclaimed himself Acting Prince of Liang, all while still recognizing Jin as his overlord.

=== Internal turmoil and decline ===
Zhang Jun died in 346 and was succeeded by his son Zhang Chonghua. Relations between Former Liang and Later Zhao had soured near the end of Zhang Jun&#x27;s reign, and shortly after Chonghua ascended, Zhao launched an invasion on Liang. The Liang general, Xie Ai initially repelled the invaders, but they still lost their territory south of the Yellow River. During and after the Later Zhao collapse in the early 350s, Chonghua attempted to reclaim lost land and expand eastward, but his efforts were frustrated by the new and rising Former Qin dynasty. His death in 353 began a lengthy period of internal turmoil within the state as he left behind his 10-year-old son Zhang Yaoling on the throne.

Shortly after ascending, Yaoling was deposed by his uncle and regent, Zhang Zuo. In 354, Zhang Zuo declared himself emperor (or king), being the only Former Liang ruler to fully reject Jin&#x27;s suzerainty. In 355, a distant relative, Zhang Guan, overthrew him and installed Zhang Chonghua&#x27;s five-year-old son, Zhang Xuanjing, to take the throne. Zhang Guan acted as regent but later considered usurping the throne before he was killed by Song Hun. Song Hun and his brother, Song Cheng, were members of the prominent Song clan of Dunhuang and served as Xuanjing&#x27;s regents in succession, during which they discarded Zhang Zuo&#x27;s imperial title. In 361, Song Cheng was assassinated by the general, Zhang Yong, who soon suffered the same fate at the hands of his co-regent and Xuanjing&#x27;s uncle, Zhang Tianxi. Tianxi was the last of Xuanjing&#x27;s regents, as in 363, he deposed his nephew and assumed power for himself.

=== Fall and aftermath ===

Infighting within the Former Liang left the state severely weakened. Several pro-Eastern Jin rebellions broke out in 356 and they once more lost all their territory south of the Yellow River. Faced with pressure from the Former Qin, they were also forced to submit to them as vassals. During his regency and reign, Zhang Tianxi finally discarded the &quot;Jianxing&quot; reign era and adopted the Eastern Jin&#x27;s reign eras, thus fully recognizing their sovereignty. Later, he attempted to get the Jin commander, Huan Wen, to coordinate a campaign with him against Qin but was ignored. In 376, Former Qin invaded Former Liang, prompting Tianxi to surrender and ending the state.

Zhang Tianxi served as a mid-level official under the Qin, but in the aftermath of the Battle of Fei River in 383, he managed to escape to the Eastern Jin. He became a Jin official and was restored to his family&#x27;s title of Duke of Xiping before dying in 406. His son, Zhang Dayu attempted to restore his family&#x27;s state in 386, but was killed in 387 by Lü Guang, the founder of Later Liang.

Despite the chaos that plagued Former Liang in its later years, it also saw the emergence of the Mogao Caves, as these Buddhist grottoes are widely believed to have been first constructed by the monk, Le Zun (樂尊) near Dunhuang in 366.

<text>The national flag of Cambodia () or the Khmer national flag () in its present form was originally adopted in 1989 and readopted in 1993, after the Constituent Assembly election in 1993 and restoration of the Cambodian monarchy.

==Description==
Since around 1875, the Cambodian flag has featured a depiction of Angkor Wat in the centre. The current flag, with a blue border and red central (the stripes are in the ratio 1:2:1) was adopted following Cambodia&#x27;s independence in 1948. It was used until 9 October 1970, when a new flag was introduced for Lon Nol&#x27;s Khmer Republic that lasted until the takeover of the Khmer Rouge in 1975. The subsequent state of Democratic Kampuchea, which existed from 1975 to 1979, used a red flag with a three-towered Angkor Wat design retained in yellow beginning in 1976. The People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea was established in 1979, after the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.

The Kampuchean National United Front for National Salvation (FUNSK) revived the flag adopted by the Khmer Issarak in the days of anti-French resistance for the new state. This flag had the same colour pattern as the DK flag, but with a yellow five-towered Angkor Wat silhouette. When the PRK renamed itself as &quot;State of Cambodia&quot; (SOC) in 1989, the flag&#x27;s lower half became blue. The UNTAC flag was used during the 1992–1993 transitional period along with the flag of the SOC within Cambodia.

In 1993, the 1948 Cambodian flag was readopted. The current Cambodian flag, together with the flags of Portugal, San Marino and Spain, are the only four state flags to feature a building. Red and blue are traditional colours of Cambodia.

The flag used today is the same as that established in 1948, although the older flag is sometimes said to have used a red outline for Angkor Wat while the current flag uses black specifically. Since that time, five other intervening designs have been used. Almost all made use of the image of the temple of Angkor Wat in one form or another. This famous Hindu temple site, which dates from the 12th century, was built by the Mahidharapura monarchs. It has five towers, but these were not always all depicted in the stylised version used on flags. The monarchy was restored in September 1993, the 1948 flag having been readopted in June of that year.

==Symbolism==
==Royal Standard==
The Royal Standard of the King of Cambodia (, ; &quot;King&#x27;s Flag&quot;) is the personal flag of Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni. It is also considered among the National Symbols of Cambodia.

<text>The Later Liang (; 386–403) was a dynastic state of China and one of the Sixteen Kingdoms in Chinese history. It was founded by the Lü family of the Di ethnicity and given the prefix of &quot;Later&quot; in historiography to distinguish it with the Former Liang dynasty before them and the three Liang states (Southern, Northern and Western) that emerged during their collapse.

All rulers of the Later Liang proclaimed themselves &quot;Heavenly King&quot; (&quot;Tian Wang&quot;). The state&#x27;s founder, Lü Guang initially took on lesser titles before declaring himself Heavenly King of Liang in 396, and so the state was only known as &quot;Liang&quot; (涼) from 396 to 403. The Later Liang at its peak controlled the Hexi Corridor in Gansu with Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) as their capital. After the Southern Liang and Northern Liang broke away in 397, their territory was gradually reduced to their capital region in central Gansu.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Lü Guang was a Di military general under the Former Qin dynasty. His family was from Lüeyang Commandery, and his father, Lü Polou was a key figure in supporting Fu Jian to the throne. Lü Guang participated in various military campaigns under Fu Jian, and in 383, he was sent to command an expedition to the Western Regions. In 384, Lü Guang conquered Kucha, where he captured and met the Buddhist monk, Kumārajīva. He initially intended to settle down in the Western Regions, but at the advice of Kumārajīva, decided to return to Former Qin with his plunders. 

The Inspector of Liang province, Liang Xi was suspicious of Lü Guang and attempted to prevent him from returning. However, Lü Guang defeated and executed Liang Xi, thus taking control of the province and appointing himself as the new Inspector. It was around this time when he was made aware that the Former Qin was disintegrating following their defeat to the Eastern Jin at the Battle of Fei River in 383.

=== Reign of Lü Guang ===
In 386, after hearing of Fu Jian&#x27;s death the prior year, Lü Guang posthumously honoured him as Emperor Wenzhao before introducing a new reign era at his capital, Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). Historians consider this the beginning of the Later Liang dynasty, named so to distinguish it with the Former Liang and other Liang states from the period. However, Lü Guang would only claim an imperial title in 387, and even then, it was merely the lowly title of Duke of Jiuquan.

While a brilliant commander, Lü Guang was an unpopular ruler, as he was prone to killing his subjects and heavily relied on military might to consolidate his rule. In 386, he had several famous local literati executed, leading to a wave of rebellions breaking out in his territory, one of which was led by a member of the Former Liang ruling family, Zhang Dayu. Lü Guang managed to quell the revolts, and in 389, he elevated himself to King of Sanhe. He then began a continuous war with the Western Qin in Longxi in 391, eventually managing to briefly force them into submission in 395. In 396, he finally claimed the title of Heavenly King of Great Liang.

In 397, intending to punish Western Qin for rebelling, Lü Guang began another campaign against them, but this time, his forces were badly routed. After this defeat, another wave of rebellions broke out in Later Liang. Most notably, the Tufa-Xianbei tribe rebelled at Lianchuan (廉川堡, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) and founded the Southern Liang, while at Jiankang (建康, in modern Zhangye, Gansu), the Han Chinese administrator, Duan Ye, with the help of the Lushuihu Juqu tribe, established the Northern Liang. From here on, the Later Liang started to decline.

=== Fall ===
In 400, Lü Guang declared himself retired emperor while his eldest son to his wife, Lü Shao succeeded him as Heavenly King. However, shortly after Lü Guang died, the eldest among all of Lü Guang&#x27;s son, Lü Zuan, launched a coup and forced Lü Shao to commit suicide. During his reign, Lü Zuan attacked Southern Liang and Northern Liang but to no avail. In 401, his cousin, Lü Chao had him assassinated and passed the throne to his own brother, Lü Long.

Soon after taking power, Lü Long had many of the local leaders killed. The situation in Later Liang soon became known to the Later Qin in the east, who then laid siege onto Guzang and forced Lü Long to submit as a vassal. Later Qin bestowed Lü Long the title of Duke of Jiankang and allowed him to remain at Guzang, although they also brought back with them Kumārajīva, who had been living as a captive under Later Liang. Lü Long continued to face attacks from Southern Liang and Northern Liang. No longer able to withstand the pressure, he surrendered his entire territory to Later Qin and moved to their capital of Chang&#x27;an in 403, thus ending the Later Liang.

Lü Long served as an official under Later Qin and kept his title of Duke of Jiankang. He became a confidant to the prince, Yao Bi, who plotted to usurp the role of Crown Prince from his brother, Yao Hong. However, in 416, after a failed coup, Yao Bi committed suicide and Lü Long was executed along with his brother Lü Chao.

<doc id="448653" wikidata="Q209302" url="?curid=448653" title="Coat of arms of Cambodia">
<text>The royal arms of Cambodia is the symbol of the Cambodian monarchy. They have existed in some form close to the one depicted since the establishment of the independent Kingdom of Cambodia in 1953. It is the symbol on the royal standard of the reigning monarch of Cambodia, currently King Norodom Sihamoni.

==Description==

A light blue shield with an Unalome Sign, the Khmer Version of the Aum Symbol, on top of the sword is placed on two ceremonial pedestalled platters (&quot;phan&quot;) and the laurel wreath superimposed on the Royal Order of Cambodia on the bottom. The shield is placed on the white mantle with golden fringes and the golden decorations on the bottom and was surmounted by the Royal Crown with the shining diamond emanating from the rays of light at the top of the crown. The shield is supported by the two royal animals are the Gajasingha (the lion with an elephant trunk) to the left and the Rajasingha (the royal lion) to the right holding two royal five-tiered umbrellas (one on each side) standing on the blue ribbon with the words: &quot;&quot; (In Khmer, &quot;Ruler of the Kingdom of Cambodia&quot;).

The two royal animals of the gajasingha and the rajasingha holding two royal five-tiered umbrellas representing the King and the Queen.

The Khmer-language phrase on the banner beneath the royal arms translates to: &quot;preăh chau&quot; (royal or auspicious ruler) - &quot;krŏng&quot; (area, or in this case, kingdom) - &quot;Kămpŭchéa&quot; (Cambodia): &quot;Ruler of the Kingdom of Cambodia&quot;.

==History==
The royal arms were discontinued with the overthrow of the monarchy in the Republican Era (1970–1975). They were restored for official use in 1993 with the reinstatement of the monarchy under HM Norodom Sihanouk.

Other arms were used during succeeding periods: Democratic Kampuchea (i.e., Khmer Rouge era: 1975-1979), the People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea (1979–1989), and the State of Cambodia (1989–1993).

<doc id="448657" wikidata="Q159872" url="?curid=448657" title="Flag of Cameroon">
<text>The national flag of Cameroon () was adopted in its present form on 20 May 1975 after Cameroon became a unitary state. It is a vertical tricolour of green, red and yellow pales, with a yellow five-pointed star in its center. There is a wide variation in the size of the central star, although it is always contained within the inside stripe.

==Description==
The colour scheme uses the traditional Pan-African colours (Cameroon was the second state to adopt them). The centre stripe is thought to stand for unity: red is the colour of unity, and the star is referred to as &quot;the star of unity&quot;. The yellow stands for the sun, and also the savannas in the northern part of the country, while the green is for the forests in the southern part of Cameroon.

The previous flag of Cameroon, used from 1961 to 1975, had a similar colour scheme, but with two gold (darker than the third stripe by comparison) stars in the upper half of the green. It was adopted after British Southern Cameroons joined with Republic of Cameroon to create the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The two stars represented the two components of the federation, East Cameroon and West Cameroon.

The original flag of the State of Cameroon and the Republic of Cameroon, made law by Law No. 46 of 26 October 1957, was the simple tricolour. It was confirmed on 21 February 1960 in the new constitution.

==Military flags and ensigns==
Military flags and ensigns of Cameroon are following British practice with different designs.

<text>Benguela () is a province of Angola, situated in the west of the country. It lies on the Atlantic Ocean, and borders the provinces of Cuanza Sul, Namibe, Huila, and Huambo. The province has an area of and its capital is Benguela. According to the 2014 census, there were 2,231,385 inhabitants in the province. The current governor of Benguela is Isaac dos Anjos.

==History==
In the 16th-century there existed a Kingdom of Benguela. Its ruler first contacted agents of the Portuguese government in 1586 after Dias de Novais had defeated the forces of the ruler of Ndongo. A Portuguese attempt to contact the rulers of Benguela failed in 1587.

As of 1600 the ruler of Benguela was Hombi a Njimbe (sometimes Anglicized as Hombiangymbe). The kingdom at that time stretched from the headwaters of the Cuvo River to the Longa River, covering the northwestern highlands of what is today Angola. This area at the time was primarily Umbundu speaking.

The Portuguese crown created the Kingdom of Benguela in 1615 to improve the conditions to develop the desired land route to Mozambique across Africa. The trading post founded here did not meet the expectations of the Portuguese in mineral resources and soil quality, so a village was only established for the slave trade, under the name of Mbaka.

With the era of imperialist efforts of European countries to acquire colonies in Africa, at the end of the 19th century, Portugal increased its presence in the region in order to protect them from the advances of the German Empire and other states. Even before the Berlin Congo Conference in 1884–85, when European powers divided up the African colonial territories among themselves, Portugal had strengthened its colonial administration as early as 1869, and divided the three districts of Luanda, Benguela and Moçâmedes (now Namibe). From 1903, the Benguela Railway was built connecting the port of Lobito to Belgian Congo, which led to the growing importance of the port and industries emerged, particularly the processing of sisal fiber, which contributed to the development of district of Benguela. By 1912, the Benguela Railway had reached Huambo from Lobito, and the line was eventually completed in 1929. Mostly after 1938, Benguela city&#x27;s rubber and ivory trade made it a &quot;relevant commercial warehouse&quot;.

Since the 1960s, with increased competition in the sisal trade worldwide, rich fish stocks off the coast have been one of the principal economic drivers of the region. From the late 1960s the population structure has changed, partly due to the regional economic upheaval, the massive emigration of European settlers from Angola when it became independent in 1975, and the influx of many IDPs during the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002); 1988 figures put the displaced population in the province at 21,478, living in nine camps.

==Geography==

<text>Bié is a province of Angola located on the Bié Plateau in central part of country. Its capital is Kuito, which was called Silva Porto until independence from Portugal in 1975. The province has an area of and a population of 1,455,255 in 2014. The current governor of Bié is José Amaro Tati.

==Geography==
Bié has boundaries with the province of Malanje, to the northeast with the province of Lunda Sul, to Moxico, to the south with Cuando Cubango and to the west with the provinces of Huila, Huambo and Cuanza Sul.

==Climate==
The climate of Bié is cool and abundant rainfall makes it possible to farm maize, sugar cane, rice, coffee and peanuts. Its ground is among the most fertile in Angola.

==History==
The province was once an important commercial link between the Portuguese traders at the port of Benguela on the Atlantic Ocean and the Ovimbundu in the interior. The capital and other cities in the province remain important commercial centers in Angola.

===Origins of Jonas Savimbi===

Bié province is perhaps best known as the place where the family of Angolan political leader Jonas Savimbi came from. Savimbi, although born in Moxico Province near Bié, was ethnically Bieno, i.e. of a subgroup of the Ovimbundu. He led the UNITA movement first in the anti-colonial war against the Portuguese, and then in the Civil War against the ruling MPLA before he was killed in combat in 2002. Savimbi gained global notoriety as a United States ally during the Cold War.

===Civil War===

Bié is one of the regions that was heavily affected by the Civil War. Agriculture came to a halt in several areas, and part of the rural population fled to the cities. The province capital Kuito was in part destroyed by bombing, as were roads and other infrastructures. Since 2002, reconstruction efforts have been important, but as of early 2011 much remained to be done.

<doc id="448664" wikidata="Q969687" url="?curid=448664" title="HMS Orion (85)">
<text>HMS &quot;Orion&quot; was a light cruiser which served with distinction in the Royal Navy during World War II. She received 13 battle honours, a record only exceeded by and matched by two others.

==History==
&quot;Orion&quot; was built by Devonport Dockyard (Plymouth, U.K), Vickers-Armstrong (Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK).
&quot;Orion&quot; was commissioned on 18 January 1934, for service with the Home Fleet but she was transferred to the America and West Indies Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Ireland Island, in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, in 1937 where she was with the 8th Cruiser Squadron. She arrived at Bermuda on the 3rd of September, 1937. Around 19:15 on the 21st of September, while exercising off Bermuda, &quot;Orion&quot; was ordered, in response to a request from the United States Consul for assistance, to make its way towards the position of the sail training ship USS &quot;Annapolis&quot;, four hundred miles from Bermuda at 35 degrees North and 54 degrees West. Cadet Robert Hugh Quinn, aboard &quot;Annapolis&quot;, required an immediate operation for appendicitis and the 7 knot speed of &quot;Annapolis&quot; would not enable it to reach Bermuda in time. The two ships were in sight of each other by 0858 on the 22nd of September. After Captain Hines of the &quot;Annapolis&quot; came aboard to meet with the captain of &quot;Orion&quot;, HRG Kinahan, &quot;Orion&quot; set off for Bermuda by 1038 with the American cadet, entering through the Narrows channel at night and arriving at the dockyard at 0246 on the 23rd of September, from where Quinn was delivered to the Royal Naval Hospital. On the 27th of October, 1937, the Flag of the America and West Indies Station was transferred to &quot;Orion&quot; when HMS &quot;York&quot; was sent to Trinidad due to civil unrest there, leaving the Commander-in-Chief at Admiralty House, Bermuda. &quot;Orion&quot; remained temporary flagship until HMS &quot;York&quot; returned on the 21st of November, 1937. On the 15th of November, the ocean liner MV &quot;Reina del Pacifico&quot;, which operated between Liverpool and Valparaíso, Chile, via Bermuda, the West Indies and the Panama Canal, stopped at Bermuda on its way to Chile with the body of former Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald who had died aboard on the 9 November. MacDonald&#x27;s body was transferred to the navy for return to Plymouth. All of the cruisers of the station were away from Bermuda at that moment except for &quot;Orion&quot; and HMS &quot;Apollo&quot;. As &quot;Apollo&quot; was undergoing a refit at the dockyard, it would have fallen to &quot;Orion&quot; to deliver MacDonald&#x27;s body, but as flagship she could not leave the station. &quot;Apollo&quot; was consequently hurried through her refit instead. &quot;Orion&quot; was tasked with the memorial service for MacDonald, whose body was taken aboard the Royal Navy tug &quot;Sandboy&quot; once the &quot;Reina del Pacifico&quot; was in Bermudian waters and landed on Front Street in the City of Hamilton along with the dockyard Chaplain, the Orion&#x27;s Chaplain, an Honour Guard, sentries and coffin bearers. MacDonald&#x27;s coffin was borne on a gun carriage to the Church of England&#x27;s Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, in a procession that included the ship&#x27;s company of &quot;Orion&quot; and a detachment of the Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), serving in the Bermuda Garrison and based at Prospect Camp. At the cathedral, Arthur Browne, the Bishop of Bermuda, conducted the memorial service, which was followed by a lying in state. The following day, the procession was repeated back to the &quot;Sandboy&quot; which bore MacDonald&#x27;s body to &quot;Apollo&quot; at the dockyard, which departed Bermuda for Plymouth at 1100, also carrying MacDonald&#x27;s daughter, Miss Sheila MacDonald. &quot;Orion&quot; conveyed the ashes of Lord Tweedsmuir, Governor General of Canada, back to England in February 1940.

In June 1940 she was transferred to the Mediterranean, where she was with the 7th Cruiser Squadron as John Tovey&#x27;s flagship. She took part in the bombardment of Bardia, and the Battle of Calabria in July 1940. Late in that month, she sank the small Greek freighter &quot;Ermioni&quot; which was ferrying supplies to the Italian-held Dodecanese islands. During the rest of 1940 she escorted Malta convoys and transported troops to Greece. In the early part of 1941 she was in the Crete and Aegean areas and was also at the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941.

In the course of an attack on a German convoy headed for Crete on 22 May, she was damaged in a duel with its escort, the Italian torpedo boat . On 29 May 1941, during the evacuation of Crete, she was bombed and badly damaged while transporting 1900 evacuated troops. Around 360 people died, of whom 100 were soldiers. After extensive damage control had been undertaken she limped to Alexandria at , providing a spectacular sight in the harbour with the mast wedged into the ship’s funnel and significant battle damage. On 29 June &quot;Orion&quot; sailed for passage to Simonstown, South Africa via Aden for temporary repairs and then sent to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California for major repairs.

&quot;Orion&quot;&#x27;s repairs were completed in March 1942 and she returned initially to Plymouth where new radar was installed. During mid 1942, she was widely employed, in home waters and on convoy escort duties to Africa and the Indian Ocean.

&quot;Orion&quot; returned to the Mediterranean in October 1942. This time she was with the 15th Cruiser Squadron. She was involved in convoy escort duties and supported the army in the invasion of Sicily. She spent most of the rest of the war around the Mediterranean. James Gornall the former English first-class cricketer, promoted to Captain in 1941 was placed in command of her in 1943. She also took part in the Normandy Landings in June 1944, where she fired the first shell.

===Corfu Channel Incident===
&quot;Orion&quot; was involved in the Corfu Channel Incident in 1946, a conflict between Britain and Albania involving the navigation of British ships in the channel between the Greek island of Corfu and the Albanian coast.

===Fate===
&quot;Orion&quot; ended service in 1947, was sold for scrap to Arnott Young (Dalmuir, Scotland) on 19 July 1949 and was scrapped in August 1949.

==Battle honours==

* Atlantic 1939;
* Calabria 1940, Mediterranean 1940-43-44;
* Malta Convoys 1941, Matapan 1941, Greece 1941, Crete 1941;
* Sicily 1943, Salerno 1943;
* Aegean 1944, Anzio 1944, Normandy 1944, South France 1944.

Only and , which served in the Mediterranean with &quot;Orion&quot;, matched this record; it was exceeded by &quot;Warspite&quot;, the Mediterranean Fleet flagship, which saw service in both World Wars.

<doc id="448668" wikidata="Q102944" url="?curid=448668" title="Flag of Cape Verde">
<text>The national flag of Cape Verde () was adopted on 22 September 1992, replacing the flag adopted during independence.

== Description ==
The flag of Cape Verde has five unequal horizontal bands of blue, white, and red, with a circle of ten yellow five-pointed stars, all pointing upwards. The topmost blue stripe is half the height of the flag. Each of the three stripes of white and red are one twelfth of the height, and the bottom blue stripe is one quarter. Therefore, the height of the stripes are in a 6:1:1:1:3 ratio.

The circle of stars is centered at of the height from the bottom (which corresponds to the center of the red stripe), and of the length from the hoist side. The lowest star is inscribed in an invisible circle centered at the middle of the lower blue stripe (that is, one eighth of the height from the bottom). The size of this invisible circle (which determines the size of the stars) is not specified by the constitution, but it is commonly constructed with a diameter equal to 1/12 of the height of the flag, i.e. the same height as the red and white stripes.

=== Symbolism===

The 10 stars on the flag represent the main islands of the nation (a chain of islands off the coasts of Senegambia and Mauritania in West Africa). The blue represents the ocean and the sky. The band of white and red represents the road toward the construction of the nation, and its colours stand for peace (white) and effort (red). The circle of yellow stars on a dark blue field is similar to the flag of Europe (which has 12 stars instead of 10).

=== Proportions ===
The Constitution of the Republic does not specify official proportions for the height and the length of the flag. The dimensions of the parts that make up the flag are given proportionally to the dimensions of the sides, without specifying the side dimensions. However, the proportion most widely used is 2:3, which is the same proportion that was used in the flag prior to 1992. Consequently, both 10:17 and 2:3 are the &quot;de facto&quot; proportion of the flag.

=== Colour shades ===

The &quot;Boletim Oficial&quot; gives the official shades of the flag&#x27;s colours (as well as the colours of the Arms of the Republic):

The Pantone, CMYK and RGB are official as published in the bulletin. The other colour shades (Web and HSV) are interpretations of the Pantone standards.

== History ==
Before independence from Portugal, Cape Verde did not have an official flag, and the Portuguese national flag was used. In the late 1960s, a flag for the Portuguese overseas province of Cape Verde was proposed, consisting of the flag of Portugal with the shield from the provincial arms added to the lower fly. However, this flag was never adopted.

The original national flag of Cape Verde was introduced on independence in 1975 and was based on the flag of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). It used the common African colours of red, green and yellow, and was identical to the flag of Guinea-Bissau except for the proportions and the charge in the hoist-side stripe. Their similarity evoked the plans to unite both countries, which were abandoned shortly after independence. Guinea-Bissau gained independence on 10 September 1974.

<doc id="448670" wikidata="Q215268" url="?curid=448670" title="Cuando Cubango Province">
<text>Cuando Cubango (Umbundu: Kwando Kubango Volupale) was a former province of Angola. It was divided into the provinces of Cuando and Cubango in 2024.

Cuando Cubango had an area of 199,049km2 and a population of 534,002 in 2014. Menongue was the capital of the province.

The name of the province derives from that of the Cuando and Cubango rivers, which flow through the eastern and western edges of the province, respectively.

== History ==

Throughout much of the 1980s and 1990s, Cuando Cubango served as the location for the primary base camp of Angola&#x27;s UNITA rebel movement, led by Jonas Savimbi. The rebel movement received support from the United States as part of the Cold War conflict against Angola&#x27;s Marxist government, which was supported by the Soviet Union, Cuba and other communist states.

Savimbi and UNITA maintained a large and clandestine base camp in the Cubando Cubango town of Jamba. The camp was protected by anti-aircraft weapons and included an air strip, which was used for the delivery of military and other supplies, which typically arrived from neighboring Zaire. The Angolan Civil War ultimately became one of the most prominent conflicts of the Cold War, with both the United States and the Soviet Union depicting its outcome as important to the global balance of power.

<text>Cunene is a province of Angola. It has an area of 87,342 km2 and a population of 990,087 in 2014.
Ondjiva is the capital of the province; it was previously known as Vila Pereira d’Eça. Ondjiva is the only city in this province with the distance from Ondjiva to Luanda is 1424 km and to Lubango is 415 km. The Cunene River gave its name to the province.

Cunene lies north of the Cunene River, which forms the border between Angola and Namibia. Cunene is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

During World War I the region was the scene of fighting in 1914–15. The German campaign in Angola resulted in Germany&#x27;s temporary occupation of the area.

The inhabitants of the Province are overwhelmingly Ovambo pastoralists. Since the 1960s, they have been under pressure first from white settlers, and after independence from high-ranking military officers and politicians, who acquired large extensions of land which the Ovambo need for the transhumance of their cattle. The ecological, economic and social disadvantages of pastoralism over ranching has been known since the 1970s, but has not been sufficiently taken into account in policy making.

* Cahama
* Kuroka (Curoca)

<doc id="448681" wikidata="Q7581354" url="?curid=448681" title="Sproul Plaza">
<text>Sproul Plaza is one center of student activity at the University of California, Berkeley. It is divided into two sections: Upper Sproul and Lower Sproul. They are vertically separated by and linked by a set of stairs.

==History==
Sproul Plaza as well as Sproul Hall are named for the last (1930–1952) University of California, Berkeley president, Robert Gordon Sproul. The Plaza was designed by landscape architect Lawrence Halprin in 1962. At the time, the university was expanding its core campus southward from its prior border at Strawberry Creek to Bancroft Avenue, and acquired acres of commercial and residential properties in the south campus Telegraph Avenue area.

== Upper Sproul ==
Upper Sproul Plaza is bordered to the east by Sproul Hall, which was formerly the location of the campus administration, and is today the location of student and admission services. To the north is Sather Gate, which leads into the central campus, and to the south are Telegraph Avenue and the South Campus area of Berkeley. Sproul Hall is situated on a rise above Upper Sproul Plaza and features a broad, terraced stairway leading to the entrance. Large numbers of students walk past Sproul Hall on their way to class or Telegraph Avenue.

The combination of a stairway that can be used as a large raised platform and a ready audience makes Upper Sproul Plaza a popular location for student protests, the first of which occurred in 1964 during the Free Speech Movement, when Mario Savio spoke from the Sproul Hall steps, and folk singer Joan Baez gave an early performance. A small round brass marker, embedded in the concrete, declares them as the &quot;Mario Savio Steps.&quot; Upper Sproul Plaza was also the site of early teach-ins and protests against the Vietnam War, the 1969 tear-gassing of People&#x27;s Park protesters by the National Guard, 1985–86 protests against University investment in apartheid-era South Africa, and many other political events. In 2011, Sproul Plaza was the site of Occupy Berkeley protests.

During calmer times, numerous student groups set up tables to recruit and inform other students (a practice known as &quot;tabling,&quot; as occurs at many universities throughout the United States). Upper Sproul Plaza also features a double row of the pollarded London Plane trees characteristic of the Berkeley campus. On the first Tuesday of each month from 12–1 p.m. during the fall and spring semesters, there is a &quot;Pet Hugs&quot; therapy dog event to provide stress relief to students.

== Lower Sproul ==

Lower Sproul Plaza, directly west of Upper Sproul Plaza, is the location of numerous small musical and cultural performances and is surrounded by numerous brutalist-style 1960s-era buildings owned by the ASUC, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union to the east, as well as the César E. Chávez Student Center to the north and Zellerbach Hall to the west. Lower Sproul connects to the Haas Pavilion and Recreational Sports Facility to the west. The Chávez Student Center combined forces with artist-activist Emmy Lou Packard to create the 85-foot long, 5-foot high, Modernist, bas-relief mural in the center of the Plaza. Packard&#x27;s mural is depicting California landscape features, including coastal bluffs, cultivated fields, mountains, and rivers.

Eshleman Hall, a 1960s-era building which housed the ASUC (Associated Students of the University of California) Senate, was demolished in summer 2013, after being rated &quot;seismically very poor.&quot; It has since been replaced by a new building of the same name. More than 50% of the Lower Sproul Redevelopment Project was funded by the BEARS student fee initiative, passed by student referendum in spring 2010, with the rest provided by Life and Campus Services. Eshleman Hall now houses the ASUC and Graduate Assembly (GA) offices, Registered Student Organization co-working space, Senate Chambers, Public Service Center, LEAD Center, Student Technology Services Helpdesk, meetings rooms, and the Bear&#x27;s Lair pub.

The Martin Luther King Jr. Building is home to the Campus Living Room, Pauley Ballroom, Cal Student Store, Berkeley Art Studio, Multicultural Community Center, Creative Lab, a coffee shop, a food hall, and many student-run services such as BicyCal, Blue &amp; God Yearbook, SUPERB, ReUse, Open Computing Facility, and more. The Basement of the Martin Luther King Jr. Building houses the Basic Needs Center, including the Food Pantry, Student Environmental Resource Center, BWell, and an extension of the Student Parents Center. The César E. Chávez Student Center houses the Student Learning Center and the Golden Bear Café. Zellerbach Hall is the largest indoor performance auditorium on campus, and frequently hosts guest speakers as well as Cal Performances engagements.

<doc id="448686" wikidata="Q218848" url="?curid=448686" title="Huambo Province">
<text>Huambo is a province of Angola. With an area of 34,270 km2, it is one of the geographically smaller provinces, situated in the Central Region approximately 450 km south east of the capital, Luanda.

The province had a population of 2,019,555 according to the 2014 census, of which 48% are in urban areas.

==Terrain and climate==
The foundation of the Central Plateau is a vast slab of primeval crystalline rock that frequently outcrops in the form of isolated rocks or massive peaks. The most prominent peak in the province is Mt. Môco in Londuimbali, with 2,620 metres. The peak is the highest point in Angola. The headwaters of the Kunene River rise on the Central Plateau near Huambo town. Much of the soil in Huambo Province is of poor quality, and has been impoverished in many areas by overuse and erosion. However, it is generally of better quality than in the adjoining regions to the east, north and south.

Striking differences can be observed between the vegetation of the highlands and the lower zone towards the coast. One characteristic feature of the coastal area is the baobab (&quot;Adansonia Digitata&quot;, or imbondeiro, in Portuguese). Tropical forests can also be found in the areas that receive significant rainfall. Until recently, the highlands were covered with a variety of trees; today, however, except in isolated areas in Bailundo and other regions, grasslands have taken the place of forest and woodland. Traditional methods of agriculture, slash-and-burn techniques (&quot;queimadas&quot;) and overpopulation by large concentrations of people displaced from their homes during the war (1975–2002) have caused significant deforestation. The use of wood fuel for the Benguela Railway until the 1980s was also responsible for deforestation. Large extensions of native forest have been cut down and replaced by rapid-growing and soil-depleting eucalyptus and pine trees.

The Central Plateau is well within the tropical zone, but altitude and the effect of the southwestern Antarctic current combine to produce a moderate climate. The annual variation of temperature is small, with maximum temperatures varying between 17 and 28 °C during much of the year. The average maximum is approximately 22 °C. During the winter months (May–July), temperatures may reach as low as 5 to 8 °C. Mean annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1600 mm, according to region. In the Central Plateau, seasonal rains begin with a few showers during September, increase during October and November, have a break of two to four weeks in December, January or February, and continue until the end of April. The heaviest rainfall is usually in November or December.

==Demography==
The Province of Huambo has an area of 35,771.15 km2. It is divided into 11 municipalities that are sub-divided into 37 communes. It borders the Province of Kuanza Sul to the northwest, Bie to the north and east, Benguela to the west, and Huila to the south. According to the Provincial Department of Statistics and Planning, Huambo is a relatively populated province with 1,948,000 people (approximately 15% of the estimated national of 12.6 million). More than half, 55%, of the population is urbanized, concentrated in Huambo City (822,000 people) and Caála Municipality (239,000 people). Recent population movements towards the native rural areas and functional deficiencies of the Civil Administration make difficult to accurately estimate population figures. The Huambo Provincial Department of Statistics and Planning reports that 419,000, or approximately 22% of the population, are children under five years of age.

==Government==

The province is headed by a Governor, currently Faustino Muteka, assisted by two vice-governors (Social and Economical Affairs). The central Government is represented also by 3 Delegates who report to their Ministry and to the Governor: Finance, Justice and Interior. The rest of Ministerial Delegations became Directorates after a reform introduced in June 1998: Health, Education, Energy and Water, Urbanism, Agriculture, Social Assistance, strengthening thus even more the power of the Governor to whom they report.
All 11 Municipalities are headed by the civilian Administrators, under whom come 35 Communal Administrators. These have their own politically appointed &quot;Regedores&quot; (textually, Rulers) and the traditional leaders, the &quot;Sobas&quot;, who have lost much of their ancestral significance in the decision – making process.

== Transport ==
Two trans-African automobile routes intersect in Huambo:
* Tripoli-Cape Town Highway
* Beira-Lobito Highway

==Agriculture and food security==
Huambo is the richest agricultural province in Angola. In 1999 the Province produced almost 22% of total national cereal production: 115,000 t out of a total of 530,000 t. As a result of improved security, areas used for cultivation in the Province have increased during the past years to about 500 km2. This represents the largest increase in the country since the end of the war.

The principal cereal crop is maize with 1950 km2 under cultivation. Yields are low, only 40 t/km2, compared with yields of between 50 and 120 t/km2 in other provinces. The second cereal crop is millet/sorghum with approximately 160 km2 under production. Grain production has increased significantly in recent years. Total output rose to a peak of 159,000 t in the 1997/1998 season compared to only 17,000 t in 1993/1994. Climate and pest conditions forced production back to 115,000 t in 1998/1999 and to an estimated 88,000 t in 1999/2000. Other crops produced in the province include beans (450 km2) and manioc (415 km2), sweet potatoes (95 km2) and Irish potatoes (32 km2).
Coffee (&quot;Arabica&quot; type) used to be a significant produce of Huambo thanks to the favourable altitude and weather conditions of the Province, and is currently being reintroduced as the main crop in many farms of the region.

==Health and nutrition==
Approximately 25 basic health facilities are operational within the Province, run by the Government or humanitarian agencies, covering 547,500 people in Huambo city and the municipality of Caála. According to the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health, this represents an average of one facility per 20,778 people, close to the Angolan average of one health unit per 20,000 people. In Huambo, one health unit serves 18,000 people while in Caála, one unit covers 33,000 people. The provincial hospital is based in Huambo city.

Vaccination coverage in Huambo city is higher than in other municipalities. In Huambo city, 16 vaccination posts cover 89,800 children under five years of age (one post per 5,600 children). In Caála, two posts cover 19,700 children (2002).

==Education==
Approximately 40 primary and three secondary schools operate in Huambo city (2001). Five schools target displaced children. In Caála, seven schools target displaced children.

==Water and sanitation==
In Huambo, the main water treatment plant has not functioned properly since 1975 and the 400 km of water pipes are in poor condition. The population is currently dependent on wells for water access. During recent years, considerable work in the sector was undertaken by the Government and humanitarian agencies, including construction of 550 family latrines and 25 wells in villages and communities.

==Mines==
The number of mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) in the Province is unknown. An average of eight mine accidents per month are reported. Mine accident statistics are gathered by humanitarian agencies through Huambo Central Hospital where all mine-related injuries are referred.
Demining activities happen throughout the Province and are currently being implemented by an International NGO. Other humanitarian institutions provide ongoing mine awareness programmes. During the year 2002, 145,000 people participated in these programmes. Mine awareness activities include theatre and puppet shows as well as exhibitions in schools and internally displaced people camps. Additionally, ten-minute radio programmes on the dangers of mines are broadcast two times per week.

<text>Huambo, formerly Nova Lisboa (English: &quot;New Lisbon&quot;), is the third-most populous city in Angola, after the capital city Luanda and Lubango, with a population of 595,304 in the city and a population of 713,134 in the municipality of Huambo (Census 2014). The city is the capital of the province of Huambo and is located about 220 km E from Benguela and 600 km SE from Luanda. Huambo is a main hub on the &quot;Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB)&quot; (the Benguela Railway), which runs from the port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of the Congo&#x27;s southernmost province, Katanga. Huambo is served by the Albano Machado Airport (formerly Nova Lisboa Airport).

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Huambo receives its name from Wambu, one of the 14 old Ovimbundu kingdoms of the central Angolan plateau. The Ovimbundu, an ethnic group that originally arrived from Eastern Africa, had founded their central kingdom of Bailundu as early as the 15th century. Wambu was one of the smaller kingdoms and was hierarchically under the king of Bailundu, though it enjoyed a considerable degree of independence.

Whereas Bailundo is mentioned in some 18th and 19th-century chronicles in connection to a trading route linking it with Viye (Bie), Wambu was only really known with the advent of the construction of the Benguela Railway by the Portuguese. Though the kings of Bailundu and Wambu (particularly Ekuikui II and Katiavala I) opposed the penetration of the railway by ambushing workers and settlers, they were eventually subdued by the Portuguese Army and Huambo was officially founded on 8 August 1912 by the Governor-General of Angola Norton de Matos.

The origin of Huambo and the economic importance it reached under Portuguese administration is very closely linked to the construction of the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (Benguela Railway), which had started in the coastal town of Lobito in 1902. This railroad had been devised by the British entrepreneur Sir Robert Williams as the easiest and cheapest way to link the rich copper mines of Katanga, in Belgian Congo, with a point on the coast from which the mineral could be exported. The Lobito bay was admittedly the best natural seaport in the whole continent.

The construction of the railway initially advanced with great difficulty, due to the ruggedness of the terrain, the prevalence of malaria and, to some extent, the resistance of the natives. Huambo was found to be a strategic place for many reasons. A benign climate (greatly due to its high altitude, 1,700m) and the presence of abundant water resources in and around made of it an ideal spot to have a hub on the railway. Once this was achieved, the works progressed comparatively faster and the link with the Belgian Congo border was completed in 1929. By then Huambo had become the site of the most important railway workshop in Africa.

By the 1920s Huambo already was one of the main economic engines of Portuguese Angola. It had some important food processing plants, served as the main exporting point for the Province&#x27;s considerable agricultural wealth and was also known by its numerous educational facilities, especially the Agricultural Research Institute (currently part of the College of Agricultural Science).

In 1928 Huambo was renamed Nova Lisboa (New Lisbon, after Lisbon the capital of Portugal), indicating that the colonial administration intended making of it at some point the capital of the colony.

In 1966, the graduations in Veterinary Medicine, Agronomy and Forestry of the General University Studies of Angola (University of Angola, from 1968) are installed in Nova Lisboa.

In motorsports, by the late 1960s, the city of Nova Lisboa had become internationally renowned for its International Nova Lisboa 6 Hours sports car race. Until the independence of Angola in 1975, the city of Nova Lisboa expanded and its economic growth and development boomed, making it one of the most important urban centres in the then Portuguese Overseas Province of Angola.

=== Post-independence ===

After independence from Portugal in 1975, Nova Lisboa was given back its original name – Huambo. The Angolan Civil War from 1975 until 2002 halted Angola&#x27;s and Huambo&#x27;s development, destroying a great part of its infrastructure.

Huambo became the site of the brutal 55 Day War and other battles during the bloody civil war between the MPLA and UNITA, that lasted from independence in 1975 until the death of rebel UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi in 2002. The city was besieged, extensively damaged, and its civilians were massacred en-masse or fled the city.

Upon independence in 1975, Savimbi declared Huambo to be the capital of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Angola, as UNITA&#x27;s rival to the MPLA&#x27;s People&#x27;s Republic of Angola. However, the MPLA took the city back on 8 February 1976 with the help of Cuban troops, though most of the surrounding areas remained under UNITA control.

By mid-1976 the Cuban expeditionary force had established its most important structures in the Province of Huambo in the areas of São Pedro, Lufefena, and Cruzeiro, and strong garrisons in most of the other municipal capitals and main towns, but UNITA had the control of nearly all of the territory in between.

Displaced people started concentrating in towns, seeking physical protection and humanitarian assistance. In this context, one of the first humanitarian agencies to arrive in the Province of Huambo was the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1979.

In 1984 the conflict escalated dramatically, and so did displacement into towns. A major relief operation was launched in the capitals of the Central Plateau and in a good number of the municipalities still accessible by plane. By then the largest part of the roads were controlled by UNITA and heavily mined.

In May 1991 a peace agreement was reached between the MPLA and UNITA. United Nations agencies and NGOs progressively moved in between mid-1991 and 1992. The situation gradually improved and general elections were called for in September 1992. But trouble set off as soon as the results of the polls were disseminated. Unrest arrived to Huambo very rapidly, as UNITA considered the Province in a way as their political shrine. They concentrated in the town most of their leaders and a large section of their troops soon after the defeat in the elections was made public.

The city would still be formally under the control of the MPLA government, but tension progressively built-up due to increasing violent actions. By the end of 1992 all foreign aid agencies had withdrawn from Huambo. UNITA took full control of the town in the course of horrendous street-to-street battles that started just after Christmas 1992 and reached its climax by mid-January in 1993. Violent combats in and around Huambo lasted for 55 days, until the MPLA Government troops withdrew and UNITA gained full control of the city. Most other cities in the Central Plateau were also occupied by UNITA at the time.

The armed conflict flared up again in August 1994. A large offensive gave back to the Government the control of Huambo on 9 November, and soon after all other provincial capitals. The UNITA headquarters was then moved to Jamba in the province of Kuando Kubango.

The war ended formally on November 20, 1994 with the signature of the Lusaka Protocol. To a great extent this step meant a move towards normalcy, and was received in Huambo with moderate optimism. UNITA moved again its headquarters soon after signing the protocol, this time to Bailundo, some 50 km north of the provincial capital. This relocation raised serious concerns among most observers.

By 1995 free transit of people and goods was quite reestablished in the Province. By the end of the year the United Nations peacekeepers (UNAVEM III) had been deployed in Huambo, following the provisions of the Lusaka Protocol. 1996 and 1997 were years of relative improvement of the living conditions of civilians in Huambo, although return movements were only moderate, reconstruction slow and commercial activities did not regain their past vigor.

After the United Nations Security Council enforced sanctions against UNITA (29 October 1997), because of delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and reluctance to demilitarize and turn over its strongholds, insecurity in Huambo increased gradually, especially in the second half of 1998. In early December the Government launched an offensive aimed at taking the last strongholds held by UNITA in Huambo and Kuito, this new war outbreak soon extending to other regions of the country.

Huge population displacements started once again from the rural areas to Huambo, Kuito and Caala. Large camps of internally displaced people were then installed in these cities as the Humanitarian Community was forced to retire out of UNITA-controlled areas, withdrawing completely by the end of the year and concentrating in Huambo, Caala, and later, Ukuma.

The security situation got extremely volatile. As Huambo and other major towns in the Plateau were being shelled from Bailundo and other positions still in possession of UNITA, two C-130 Hercules aircraft chartered by the United Nations with 23 people on board were shot down over Vila Nova (Dec. 26, 1998 and Jan. 2, 1999), as they were trying to evacuate to Luanda the last remains of the UNAVEM III mission in Huambo.

The Government retook the town of Bailundo in October 1999. Londuimbali, Vila Nova and some other large towns in the Province were already under the rule of the Government, and in December 1999 the administration of the state had been reestablished in all municipal capitals. In this period the conventional war that the Province had known gave way to guerrilla warfare, UNITA still controlling most rural areas and randomly striking military or police installations of the Government, and often civilian communities too.

The exodus of civilians into Huambo and Caála experienced a new boom.

In early 2000 there were over 25,000 displaced people in the village of Caala, and over 40,000 in Huambo town. As international sanctions tightened around UNITA, their military actions in Huambo got more frequent and destructive, reaching a peak of violence by the end of 2000.

In October 2001 the Government launched a renewed offensive against UNITA from the North and the South of the Province, combining this time strict military action with what were known as &quot;operações de limpeza&quot;, literally, cleansing operations which consisted in removing from rural areas large groups of population which were subsequently forced into a few, specific concentration points. The idea behind this strategy was depriving the guerrilla of the potential support it may still find in the villages they formerly controlled in the bush, making their natural habitat unlivable.

In the short term this resulted in renewed pressure over available resources in safe areas of the city and Province of Huambo, and in many cases in the death by starvation of groups trapped by the conflict or impeded to reach any of those zones. This point probably represents the climax in the hardship the rural civilian population went through in the Province of Huambo for the duration of the war.

The death of Jonas Savimbi in February 2002 and the subsequent signature of a new cease-fire brought back tranquility to the Province, set the conditions for the present ongoing peace process, and the beginning of an era of development.

The advent of peace brought a new era of reconstruction and regeneration in Huambo, and across Angola.

<doc id="448689" wikidata="Q924128" url="?curid=448689" title="Power Rangers Ninja Storm">
<text>Power Rangers Ninja Storm is a television series and the eleventh season of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, based on the 26th Super Sentai series &quot;Ninpu Sentai Hurricaneger&quot;. The season marked a series of firsts in the franchise, being that it was the first to be filmed in New Zealand, the first to not be produced by MMPR Productions, and the first to air on ABC Kids in its entirety, debuting on February 15, 2003. It was the last season to have theme music done by Jeremy Sweet, who had been working on most of the show&#x27;s themes since &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
In the city of Blue Bay Harbor, Shane Clarke, Tori Hanson and Dustin Brooks are three students at the Wind Ninja Academy. Their less than stellar performance and tardiness gets them the occasional lecture from their Sensei, Kanoi Watanabe. One day, the academy is attacked by Lothor, a banished ninja master and Kanoi&#x27;s identical twin brother, who has returned to capture all the ninja students. Shane, Tori and Dustin are the only three remaining students, and along with Sensei, who has been transformed into a guinea pig by Lothor, and his son Cam, retreat into the underground Ninja Ops. There, the three are given Wind Morphers, which allow them to transform into Power Rangers Ninja Storm and protect the city of Blue Bay Harbor from Lothor&#x27;s forces.

When Lothor demonstrates his ability to make his monsters grow, the Rangers unleash the Ninja Zords, which could combine into the Storm Megazord and destroy monsters with its arsenal of Power Spheres, activated by special ninja power disks. Lothor again raises the stakes by sending his new allies to battle the Wind Rangers - the Thunder Rangers, Blake and Hunter Bradley, who have their own Thunder Zords. The Thunder Rangers are on a mission to destroy the Wind Rangers&#x27; Sensei, who they believed to be responsible for their parents&#x27; death, but a visit from the afterlife from Blake and Hunter&#x27;s parents show them the truth - that it was Lothor who killed them. The Thunder Rangers see the error of their ways and join the Wind Rangers in the battle against Lothor, bringing the Thunder and Ninja Zords together to form the Thunderstorm Megazord.

When the Rangers lose their powers, Cam uses the Scroll of Time to travel into the past and retrieve the Samurai Amulet, a family heirloom in the possession of his late mother, where he discovers how Lothor rose to power. Cam returns to the present and uses the amulet to become the Green Samurai Ranger, armed with the Samurai Star Megazord, which later combines with the Rangers&#x27; zords to form the Hurricane Megazord. A lost scroll would later reveal to Cam the Lightning Riff Blaster, which could summon the Mighty Mammoth Zord, which combines with the Thunderstorm Megazord or the Hurricane Megazord to form the Thunderstorm Ultrazord or the Hurricane Ultrazord.

In a last-ditch effort to take over the world, Lothor attempts to open the Abyss of Evil and release its evil, causing all the monsters that were defeated over the season to be resurrected. In a final battle, the rangers, along with the rescued ninja students manage to defeats Lothor&#x27;s revived army, but he steals the Samurai Amulet and uses it to take away all of the Rangers&#x27; powers. However the Wind Rangers combine their inner ninja powers to overpower Lothor and throw him into the abyss. After the battle, the powerless Rangers become ninja masters at the Wind Ninja Academy.

<text>Huíla is a province of Angola. It has an area of and a population of 2,497,422 (2014 census). Lubango is the capital of the province. Basket-making is a significant industry in the province; many make baskets out of reeds.

==History==
From the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–1975) to Angola&#x27;s independence, and the subsequent civil war in Angola (1975-2002) Huíla was directly affected only during relatively short periods of time. Cassinga was abandoned by its European supervisors, and the mine fell into neglect during the ensuing Angolan Civil War. The following year it was occupied by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN), military wing of the South West African People&#x27;s Organization. PLAN subsequently adopted Cassinga as a staging point for insurgent raids on South-West Africa, about 250 kilometres to the south. Their bases soon became a sanctuary for local refugees during the Namibian War of Independence.

In 1978, PLAN&#x27;s presence in Cassinga attracted the attention of the South African Defence Force. Operation Reindeer saw paratroops of the 44 Parachute Regiment supported by bomber and strike aircraft launch an air assault on 4 May. The six-hour assault claimed approximately 600 lives, including four SADF soldiers, sixty Cuban soldiers and over five hundred PLAN combatants and South West African exiles. Cassinga was the site of more fighting during &quot;Operation Askari&quot;, in December 1983.

The post-colonial development in Angola has seen the establishment of two universities in Lubango (the state Universidade Mandume, named after a leader of the Ovambo in the fight against the occupation by the Portuguese, as well as a campus of the Universidade Privada de Angola. Tourism is emerging, largely involving white entrepreneurs from Namibia, which the provincial government is actively seeking to attract.

==Geography==
Huíla Province is traversed by the northwesterly line of equal longitude and latitude. The province is bordered on the west by the provinces of Namibe and Benguela, to the north by Bié and Cuando Cubango, and to the south by the province of Cunene. The winding road known as Leba Hill, as well as Bicauri National Park are in Huíla Province. Bicauri National Park was established in 1964 and covers an area of 790 km2.

==Municipalities==
The province of Huíla contains fourteen municipalities ():

==Communes==

==Demographics==

As of 2013, the province had a population of 2,609,486 people. The original inhabitants of the area were Khoisan, but only a few residual groups remain today, ousted from pastoral land by other groups. In some areas they represent under 2% of the population. Most pastoral farmers in the province are known Nyaneka-Khumbi, but do not form a whole ethnic group. A significant ethnic group in the province is the Mwila, who originally inhabited the plateau areas.

Favored by the relatively mild climate, there was a relatively strong colonization by Portuguese immigrants who sometimes mixed with the local population. This led to expansion and diversification of agriculture at the same time, but also to a growth of cities and towns. However, the influx of IDPs in the thousands during the war severely affected the province.
During the war, a considerable number of Ovimbundu fled to the highlands of the province of Huíla. In some areas they now represent some 37% of the population, with the largest concentration in the central highlands. There is now also a much smaller number of Bakongo who had been assimilated from the Congo, and some settled in the province upon their return. The Heroro represent about 0.5% of the population.

<doc id="448703" wikidata="Q1330290" url="?curid=448703" title="Southern Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)">
<text>The Southern Liang (; 397–404, 408–414) was a dynastic state of China listed as one of the Sixteen Kingdoms in Chinese historiography. Members of the ruling Tufa clan were of Xianbei ethnicity and distant relatives of the Tuoba imperial house of the Northern Wei dynasty. According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, the surname of the ruling house was changed from Tuoba to Tufa because one of the Tufa ancestors was born on a blanket, and in the Xianbei language, &quot;Tufa&quot; meant &quot;blanket.&quot;

All rulers of the Southern Liang proclaimed themselves &quot;wang&quot; (king). The state was briefly discontinued in 404 after Tufa Rutan surrendered to the Later Qin, but restored in 408. As the state grew in power, the Tufa rulers also elevated their peerages before claiming the title of King of Liang in 402. It was hence only known as &quot;Liang&quot; (涼) from 402 to 404 and 408 to 414. They are given the prefix of &quot;Southern&quot; in historiography as they were based south of the other Liang states in northeastern Qinghai, although after occupying central Gansu, they briefly shifted the capital to the major city of Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu).

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Xianbei Tufa tribe was an offshoot of the Tuoba. In the early 4th-century, their chieftain, Pigu (匹孤), led his followers west to the Hexi Corridor from the Yin mountains after his brother, Tuoba Liwei, succeeded their father. They lived among the Han Chinese and Qiang people, and adopted the Tufa family name. During the Cao Wei period, they surrendered to the general, Deng Ai and were relocated to what later became known as Qin province. In 270, their chieftain Tufa Shujineng led a massive tribal rebellion against the Western Jin dynasty. Although he captured Liang province in 279, the rebellion ended after he was killed that same year.

The Tufa returned to prominence during the Former Qin collapse that followed the Battle of Fei River. In 386, their chieftain, Tufa Sifujian (禿髮思復鞬) allied with Zhang Dayu, who sought to restore the Former Liang, but Dayu was defeated and executed by the Later Liang. At the time, the Tufa were living around Guangwu Commandery (廣武郡; around present-day Yongdeng County, Gansu) in Liang province.

After Sifujian died, his son, Tufa Wugu succeeded him. Wugu expanded his influence by encouraging agriculture among his followers and drilling them for war while recruiting new talents to join him. He caught the attention of the Later Liang ruler, Lü Guang who granted him offices and the title of Duke of Guangwu. In 394, he subjugated the Yifu (乙弗), Zhejue (折掘) and other tribes in Qinghai, where he built a fort in Lianchuan (廉川堡, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) and made it his capital. Wugu refused to acknowledge Lü Guang&#x27;s claim as Heavenly King in 396, although did not outwardly rebel just yet.

=== Founding ===
After Later Liang suffered a heavy defeat to Western Qin in 397, Tufa Wugu proclaimed himself the Prince of Xiping and changed the era name, signifying a breakaway. Soon, the Northern Liang was also established by Duan Ye at Jiankang (建康, in modern Zhangye, Gansu), while a revolt broke out at the Later Liang capital, Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) led by Guo Nun, throwing Later Liang into a state of civil war. In 398, after defeating the powerful Qiang leader, Liang Ji (梁飢), many governors and tribes around Later Liang began submitting to him. Wugu changed his title to Prince of Wuwei and moved the capital to Ledu (樂都, in modern Haidong Prefecture, Qinghai) before dying of illness resulting from a horse riding accident.

After Tufa Lilugu succeeded his brother, he shifted the capital to Xiping (西平郡; around present-day Xining, Qinghai) and claimed the title of Prince of Hexi. During his reign, the situation in Later Liang had worsened after Lü Guang&#x27;s death due to infighting among the ruling family. Lilugu concentrated military efforts against Later Liang, defeating them twice and entering an alliance with Northern Liang. As the Later Qin in Guanzhong encroached on Hexi, he avoided conflict and submitted to them as a vassal.

Lilugu died in 402 and was succeeded by his brother Tufa Rutan, who took the title of King of Liang. Rutan moved the capital back to Ledu and intensified attacks on the Later Liang. Eventually, Later Liang surrendered over their territory to Later Qin in 403. Rutan assured his vassalage to Qin by adopting their era name within his territory in 404. Still, he remained largely independent and continued attacking Northern Liang despite also being a Qin vassal. In 406, Qin rewarded Rutan&#x27;s loyalty by handing him control over Guzang, which he later made his capital. He also entered an alliance with the Western Liang to counter Northern Liang.

=== Decline and fall ===
In 407, Tufa Rutan decided to break off relations with Later Qin, but his rule would enter a gradual decline from this point on. That year, he invaded the Northern Liang but was badly routed, and afterwards, he was heavily defeated by the Helian Xia in the Ordos where many of his key officials died in battle. Confidence in the state began to wane as rebellions soon broke out, although they were quickly put down. In 408, capitalizing on Southern Liang&#x27;s troubles, Later Qin attacked them and laid siege on Guzang, during which there was a revolt attempt within the city. Rutan repelled the attack and made peace with Later Qin, later re-declaring himself the King of Liang, but his state had been greatly weakened by these series of crises.

In the next few years, Rutan launched several campaigns on Northern Liang but was repeatedly defeated. The defeat in 410 saw more rebellions breaking out in his territory, leading to the capital being shifted back south to Ledu while Guzang fell to Northern Liang. He also faced attacks from the Tuyuhun and Western Qin. By 413, Southern Liang had been reduced to only a few commanderies along the Huangshui River.

In 414, the Yifu, Tuoqihan (唾契汗) and other tribes in Qinghai rebelled. At the same time, the Southern Liang had also been suffering from poor harvest and famines for many years. Desperate to escape his situation, Rutan campaigned against the tribes, but while he was away, the Western Qin attacked and captured Ledu, prompting the rest of Southern Liang&#x27;s territory to surrender. Rutan was forced to surrender, thus ending the Southern Liang.

Tufa Rutan was initially treated with honor in Western Qin, but by the end of 414, he was poisoned to death by their ruler, Qifu Chipan. In 423, Rutan&#x27;s children, Princess Tufa and Tufa Hutai (禿髮虎台) attempted to assassinate Chipan but were caught and executed. The Tufa fled to Northern Liang and then to the Northern Wei, where the ruling Tuoba clan recognized them as family due to their lineage from Tuoba Jiefen. In particular, Rutan&#x27;s son, Tufa Poqiang, became a powerful official in Wei and was given the name Yuan He by the Wei emperors, his new family name &quot;Yuan&quot; (源) in reference to them having a common ancestor. Tufa Wugu&#x27;s son, Tufa Fanni (禿髮樊泥), is alleged by the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; to be the ancestor of the Tibetan Empire&#x27;s imperial family.

<doc id="448707" wikidata="Q903323" url="?curid=448707" title="Kootenay National Park">
<text>Kootenay National Park is a national park of Canada in southeastern British Columbia. The park consists of of the Canadian Rockies, including parts of the Kootenay and Park mountain ranges, the Kootenay River and the entirety of the Vermilion River. While the Vermilion River is completely contained within the park, the Kootenay River has its headwaters just outside the park boundary, flowing through the park into the Rocky Mountain Trench and eventually joining the Columbia River. The park ranges in elevation from at the southwestern park entrance to at Deltaform Mountain.

Initially called &quot;Kootenay Dominion Park&quot;, the park was created in 1920 as part of an agreement between the province of British Columbia and the Canadian federal government to build a highway in exchange for title to a strip of land, approximately on either side of the 94 km route, the Banff–Windermere Highway, to be used solely for park purposes. While the park is open all year, the major tourist season lasts from June to September. Most campgrounds are open from early May to late September, while limited winter camping is available only at the Dolly Varden campground.

Kootenay National Park is one of seven contiguous national and provincial parks that form the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site. The Continental Divide is the boundary between Kootenay and Banff National Park, as well as the British Columbia–Alberta provincial border. To the northwest, the watershed boundary between the Vermilion River and the Kicking Horse River serves as the boundary between Kootenay and Yoho National Park. Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park also borders Kootenay; Jasper National Park, Mount Robson Provincial Park and Hamber Provincial Park make up the remainder of the World Heritage Site but do not share a boundary with Kootenay National Park.

==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests humans have been either traveling through, or temporarily residing in, the area for about 10,000 years. Pictographs found in the hot spring caves indicate that Ktunaxa people first made more permanent use of the area, particularly the hot springs, several hundred years ago.

European fur traders and trappers passed through, as did George Simpson in 1841, through what would later be named Simpson Pass, during his circumnavigation of the world. Likewise, James Sinclair led Red River colonists westward and Pierre-Jean De Smet travelled eastward, through the area. The Palliser expedition used the Vermilion Pass in 1858 and reported to British government its potential as a transportation route. On the Columbia River side, an early homesteader included the hot spring that would later become Radium Hot Springs in his land claim in the 1880s, but it was Roland Stuart and his business partner H.A. Pearse who were successful in acquiring the around the springs in 1890 as a provincial Crown grant. While they intended on bottling the spring water, its remote location prevented such development and Stuart offered to sell the property in 1909 to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company for $3000. Though the offer was not accepted, railway engineer Robert Randolph Bruce recognized the potential for a road through the area and advocated for it in 1910 with CPR president Thomas Shaughnessy and Premier Richard McBride, as a commercial link for the province to Calgary and eastern Canada. The federal government agreed to build a road from Banff to the park boundary at the provincial border at the Vermilion Pass, while the provincial government, with some funds from the CPR, would build a road from Windermere to the border. However, the BC government under-estimated its cost, found itself over-budget and its work was suspended in 1913, while the federal government completed their portion in November 1914. To get the British Columbia section completed, Bruce travelled to Ottawa to pitch the idea that they designate the western end of the route, through the Rocky Mountains, a national park so that road could be funded as a park improvement. With the popularity of Rocky Mountains Park, the Commissioner of the Parks Branch, James Bernard Harkin, and officials of the Ministry of the Interior were receptive to expanding the park system there.

In May 1916 the Minister of the Interior, William James Roche, began negotiations, and the subsequent minister agreed with the provincial counterparts to the Banff-Windermere Agreement, that the federal government would complete the road within 4 years of the end of the Great War, and maintain it thereafter, in exchange for the agreed-upon land to be used for park purposes and a resolution to jurisdictional matters in the other federal parks in BC. The agreement was signed on March 12, 1919, and the federal government took ownership of the land in July. By Order in Council 1920–0827 on April 21, 1920, the Kootenay National Park was created. The federal government repaired the provincial portion of the road and completed the remainder for public opening by June 1923.

==Attractions==
The main attractions of the park include Radium Hot Springs, the Paint Pots, Sinclair Canyon, Marble Canyon, and Olive Lake. The hot springs offer a hot springs pool ranging from . Just outside the park&#x27;s southwestern entrance is the town of Radium Hot Springs. The town is named for the odourless hot springs located just inside the park boundary. The town provides amenities and services for those camping within the park, and offers a number of accommodation options for those visiting the park but who do not intend to camp within.

The park&#x27;s northeastern entrance, connects to Castle Junction in Banff National Park and the Trans-Canada Highway via Vermilion Pass, a mountain pass across the Continental Divide of the Canadian Rockies on the Alberta/British Columbia border, at an elevation of 1,651 metres (5,416&#x27;).

===Radium Hot Springs===
Development of the hot springs began in earnest after a British medical journal suggested, and a 1914 chemical analysis by McGill University confirmed, the presence of radium within the water. Roland Stuart, who had acquired the springs through a Crown grant, purchased in the vicinity of the springs as the area became accessible by the Kootenay Central Railway. Stuart travelled to England promoting the &quot;Kootenay Radium Natural Springs Limited&quot; and recruited the paralysed St John Harmsworth to visit. After a four-month stay he invested enough to build a bathing pool with a store and a caretaker&#x27;s cottage. With the park becoming a reality, the Dominion government offered, in 1921, Stuart $20,000 for control of the springs. With his agent unable to reach him, or Stuart ignoring the offer, the government expropriated the land, in 1922, with a settlement, after numerous hearings right up to the Supreme Court, of $40,000 in 1927. In that same year, a new two-storey bath-house was erected and the pool lengthened by . Meanwhile, the town of Radium Hot Springs was being developed after the 1923 subdivision to create commercial properties and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company developed cabins the area that would later become the Radium Hot Springs Lodge. The facility was re-built after a fire in 1948 at the cost of $1,000,000 with a concrete pool and other facilities. Major renovations and improvements between 1960 and 1968 added additional capacity, a restaurant, and a campground (at the Redstreak Campground), as well as buying out the CPR cabin properties. Another round of renovations occurred in 1997 with a new hot-cold plunge pool added.

===Paint Pots===

The Paint Pots are an acidic, cold water, mineral spring system from which ochre is deposited at spring outlets. The minerals are principally iron oxide which produces the water and mud&#x27;s reddish colour but other similar minerals can also be present and vary the colours to include various shades of yellow, red and brown. The acidic, metal-rich water has limited capacity to support living species, but at least 14 species of algae, one liverwort and one moss species, as well as some extremophilic bacteria, have been identified living in those waters. The ochre was collected by the Ktunaxa people for use as pigments and the iron oxide was commercially mined for use in paint manufacturing for nearly two decades until the park was established in 1920.

Because of the relatively small width of the park (five miles on each side of the highway), many of the park&#x27;s attractions are situated near the road and are wheelchair accessible. A number of forest fires in the northern half of the park in the Simpson River, Vermilion Pass, and Floe Creek areas in 2003 and 2004 have left significant burn areas readily visible from the highway. Numa Falls is a short drive south of Marble Canyon and is accessible directly by Highway 93 which cuts through the park.

===Hiking and camping===

The Rockwall trail is a multi-day hike along the limestone cliff eastern escarpment of the Vermilion Range that continues into the Yoho National Park. There are several connections to the trail from the highway, including the 10.7 km Floe Creek trail to Floe Lake campground and the 6 km Numa Creek trail to the Numa Falls campground. There is another trailhead at the Paint Pots that follows Ochre Creek with forks to the 7 km Tumbling Creek trail and the 9 km Helmet Creek trail, both of which have campground. Beyond Helmet Falls the Rockwall trail continues through Goodsir Pass into the Yoho National Park. Other multi-day backcountry hikes include the Tokumun Creek trail to Fay Hut and Neil Colgan Hut, the Simpson River trail into the Mount Assiniboine Park, the Hawk Creek trail through Ball Pass into the Banff National Park, the Verdant trail from the Vermilion crossing to Banff National Park via the Honeymoon Pass and the Redearth Pass.

Day hikes with nearby campgrounds include trails on Redstreak Mountain and along Redstreak Creek, the Dog Lake trail from the McLeod Meadows campground, and the Marble Canyon to Paint Pots trail from the Marble Canyon campground. Other dayhikes, of various difficulty levels, include trails to Olive Lake, to Cobb Lake, the Kindersley/Sinclair loop, the Tokumun Creek trail from Marble Canyon to Kaufmann Lake, the Kimpton Creek trail, the Verendrye Creek from the Vermilion Crossing, and the Stanley Creek trail. The Dolly Varden trail along the Dolly Varden Creek (the fish was later identified as bull trout, not Dolly Varden trout) permits cycling.

==Geography==

The park is centered around the 94 km stretch of the Highway 93, from Radium Hot Springs to the provincial border at the Vermilion Pass. The park&#x27;s size and shape are the result of the federal-provincial agreement to get the road constructed. Consequently, despite the northwest–southeast trending range and valley systems, the park cuts through several mountain ranges and river valleys.

The park&#x27;s southwestern entrance, near Radium Hot Springs and the Sinclair Canyon, is the only part of the park within Southern Rocky Mountain Trench. As the highway follows Sinclair Creek, which drains westward towards the Columbia River, the park enters the Kootenay Ranges, which include Mount Berland and the western and southern faces of Mount Kindersley of the Brisco Range and Redstreak Mountain and Mount Sinclair of the Stanford Range. The eastern side of Mount Sinclair faces the valley of the Kootenay River; that and the remainder of the park drains to the Kootenay River which does eventually empty into the Columbia River but not until well outside the park and crossing the American-Canadian border twice. The park then covers a ≈27 km stretch of the Kootenay River valley including the flanking mountain faces of Mount Kindersley and the Mitchell Range and Vermilion Range of the western portion of the Park Ranges. At the bridge over Kootenay River, the road and park divert northward to follow the Vermilion River upstream through the pass between Mount Wardle of the Vermilion Range and Spar Mountain of the Mitchell Range. As the park bends northward here, it expands to include more of the Kootenay River valley, including Dolly Varden Creek, Lost Creek, and Whitetail Creek. With the Mount Assiniboine Park just over the mountains to the southeast, the road and park divert northwestward again once into the valley of the Vermilion River, near where it converges with the Simpson River. After this, the park consists of the remainder of the Vermilion River drainage basin, with the Banff National Park at the Continental Divide to the north at the Ball Range and the Bow Range, the Yoho National Park to the northwest, and the peaks of the Vermilion Range to the southwest. A small portion of the Ottertail River, which drains into the Yoho National Park, is also included the northwestern end of the park, though the remainder of that border is the dividing line between the Vermilion River and the Kicking Horse River.

There are only a few, small lakes in the park, most of which occur in the Vermilion River drainage basin and occur at high altitude in cirques or hanging valleys, which is typical for the Main Ranges. The Floe, Kaufmann and Talc lakes occur here, while the Dog, Olive and Cobb lakes occur in the Kootenay River basin and have more pond-like characteristics such as shallow depth and slower flow.

==Geology==

The geology of the park is dominated by mountains made up of exposed faulted sedimentary rock and valleys containing glacial till deposited in the Pleistocene.

Just outside the northwestern corner of the park, there is an igneous intrusion known as the Ice River Complex containing deposits of sodalite, an ornamental stone. The hills immediately around the hot springs are composed mainly of tufa, a calcium carbonate deposit that forms by precipitation of supersaturated hot spring water when it reaches cooler surface water.

The rocks in southwestern corner of the park are part of the older Purcell Mountains range while the eastern park mountains are part of the younger Rocky Mountains range.

The park has many Cambrian strata of oceanic sedimentary origin that shed insight into the explosive radiation of multicellular life on Earth. In the summer of 2012 a team of scientists from the Royal Ontario Museum, Pomona College, the University of Toronto, the University of Saskatchewan and Uppsala University discovered a Lagerstätte site above Marble Canyon of extraordinary preservation in shale, comparable to the Burgess Shale&#x27;s phyllopod bed of fossils only distant, in Yoho National Park. One species &quot;Kootenichela&quot; discovered in these rocks has been scientifically described: more than 50 new species were discovered in the Marble Canyon area in just two weeks of intensive exploration. The new assemblage of organisms, dating to the Wuliuan, such as the &quot;Surusicaris elegans&quot;, is described as rich in basal arthropods and remarkable for the density and diversity of its soft-bodied organisms, some preserved in previously unreported detail.

==Climate==
The park experiences a humid continental climate (Dfb) which is characterized by brief, cool summers and long snowy winters, but is generally drier than the areas to the west due to the Kootenay Ranges capturing moisture. Similarly, the park&#x27;s mountain ranges intercept moisture that would otherwise fall on the other side of the Continental Divide, making the Banff National Park drier. Combined with the Continental Divide protecting it from the brunt of the arctic air flow, the park experiences a more mild climate than Banff.

Based on the climate and geography, the park has been divided into different ecoregions: Montane, Subalpine and Alpine, which consequently affect vegetation and wildlife. The Montane ecoregions are at lower elevations, such as at the park&#x27;s west gate and the valley of the Kootenay River, and experience between 300 and 600 mm of precipitation each year, 30 to 45% of which falls as snow. The subalpine ecoregion, such as the valley of the Vermilion River and at Floe Lake and Marble Canyon, experience cooler and moister weather, with mean annual temperatures less than 1 degrees Celsius and about 800 mm of precipitation, over half of which is snow. The alpine ecoregion, at the park&#x27;s highest elevations, is even colder and snowier, which results in a lack of forest cover.


==Ecology==
===Flora===

The Montane Spruce biogeoclimatic zone of the park&#x27;s lower elevations contain forests of mostly Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, western larch, trembling poplar, and western redcedar. The shrub layer mostly include soapberry, kinnikinnick, western showy aster, dwarf bilberry, twinflower, pinegrass, Canadian bunchberry, littleleaf huckleberry, Rocky Mountain maple, alder, mountain huckleberry, oval-leaf blueberry, meadow horsetail, Devil&#x27;s club, as well as common and rocky mountain juniper. In the higher subalpine elevations, the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir biogeoclimatic zone takes over with its dominant tree species of Engelmann spruce, white spruce, subalpine fir and subalpine larch, begin to take over at higher elevations. Heathers, arctic willow, cinquefoils, moss campion, and mountain avens are the dominant vegetation in the alpine areas. Forest fires that affected the park, exemplified by the large fires of 1968 and 2017 and the very large fire of 2003 in the Vermilion area, feature pioneering vegetation like fireweed and lodgepole pine. An emerging drier climate, and forest fires, are resulting in the Interior Douglas-fir biogeoclimatic zone expanding into the park, with its more dominant Douglas fir, ponderosa pine and rocky mountain juniper tree stands.

===Fauna===
A wildlife survey found 242 species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The largest species are the ungulates, such as the bighorn sheep, mountain goat, moose, elk, red deer, white-tailed deer, mule deer, though there are also black bears and grizzly bears that live in the park. Coyotes and martens are the only widespread and common carnivores in the park, though bobcats and cougars live in the southern regions. Timber wolves, lynxes, wolverines, minks, fishers, badgers, river otters, skunks and long and short-tailed weasels have also been identified but are not common. The most common non-carnivorous mammal species living in the park are the snowshoe hare, red-backed vole, deer mouse, red squirrel and Columbian ground squirrel. Most bird species only use the park as their summer grounds or part of their migration route; only 32 species live solely in the park. Some of the most common birds include the boreal owl, yellow-rumped warbler, golden-crowned kinglet, common yellowthroat, American robin, spotted sandpiper, chipping sparrow, two-barred crossbill, rufous hummingbird, water pipit. Other bird species that may be observed include the common loon, Canada and Steller&#x27;s jays, Canada and snow geese, Trumpeter and Tundra swans. The three reptiles identified were the rubber boa, common garter snake and western terrestrial garter snake.

==World Heritage Site==
In 1984, UNESCO added the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site, to the World Heritage List. This World Heritage Site included the four contiguous national parks: Kootenay, Banff, Jasper and Yoho. At the time, the site was deemed to meet the natural criteria for examples of geological processes, record of life, and for exceptional natural beauty. In 1990, the Mount Assiniboine, Mount Robson and Hamber Provincial Parks were added to the World Heritage Site, bringing its total area up to . Under their Statement of Significance, UNESCO states &quot;With rugged mountain peaks, icefields and glaciers, alpine meadows, lakes, waterfalls, extensive karst cave systems and deeply incised canyons, the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks possess exceptional natural beauty, attracting millions of visitors annually.&quot;

<doc id="448708" wikidata="Q915815" url="?curid=448708" title="Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots">
<text>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots is the tenth studio album by American rock band the Flaming Lips, released on July 16, 2002, by Warner Bros. Records. The album saw the band pursue a more electronic direction than previous efforts, incorporating acoustic guitars and rhythms influenced by hip hop and top 40 music. The album was well-received critically and commercially, helping the band break into popularity, and was adapted into a musical in 2012. In 2022, the band announced a 20th anniversary box set version of the album and that they would perform the album in full twice in early 2023.

==Music and lyrics==
The lyrics of &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; concern a diverse array of subject matter, mostly melancholy ponderings about love, mortality, artificial emotion, pacifism, and deception, while telling the story of Yoshimi&#x27;s battle. The title character is inspired by musician Yoshimi P-We of Boredoms/OOIOO, following a comment in the Flaming Lips studio that her unusual singing style sounds like she is battling monsters. Flaming Lips frontman Wayne Coyne added &#x27;pink&#x27;. P-We also performs on the album. Some listeners consider &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; to be a concept album; however, the story is debated, as it is only directly apparent in the first four tracks. Despite the story-type title and science fiction themes, Coyne has made it clear that &quot;Yoshimi&quot; is not intended to be a concept album.

The vocal melody of track one, &quot;Fight Test&quot;, echoes Cat Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Father and Son&quot;. Stevens, now Yusuf Islam, is receiving royalties following a relatively uncontentious settlement. Coyne has claimed that he was unaware of the songs&#x27; similarities until producer Dave Fridmann pointed them out. This claim, however, is contradicted by his statement to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine: &quot;I know &#x27;Father and Son&#x27; and I knew there would be a little bit of comparison. &#x27;Fight Test&#x27; is not a reference necessarily to the ideas of &#x27;Father and Son&#x27;, but definitely a reference to the cadence, the melody, and chord progression. I think it&#x27;s such a great arrangement of chords and melody&quot;.

The final track, &quot;Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia)&quot;, won a 2002 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. The Flaming Lips also won the same award for &quot;The Wizard Turns On...&quot;, taken from &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;, in 2006. The title of the fifth track, &quot;In the Morning of the Magicians&quot;, is a reference to the book &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot;.

==Release==
===Commercial performance===
In recent years, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; has had a bigger commercial impact than the band&#x27;s 1999 breakthrough album &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot;, and became their first gold-certified release in April 2006. As of 2009, &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; has sold 570,000 copies in United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. On Metacritic, the album has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Calling the album &quot;as strange as it is wonderful&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; nonetheless noted that &quot;beneath the sunny, computer-generated atmospherics and the campy veneer of talk about gladiator-style clashes between man and machines with emotions, &quot;Yoshimi&quot; is actually a somber rumination on love and survival in an unfathomable world.&quot; Tom Moon of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album&#x27;s &quot;ambitious&quot; production, while &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine called it &quot;a lush and haunting electronic symphony.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; declared that &quot;even by their standards, &quot;Yoshimi&quot; is astonishing.&quot; Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; gave the album a three-star honorable mention rating, indicating &quot;an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure&quot;. &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot; appeared in the best-albums-of-the-decade lists of several music publications, such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (#27) and &quot;Uncut&quot; (#11), with &quot;Uncut&quot; also declaring it the greatest album released in the magazine&#x27;s lifetime. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Musical==
In 2007, it was announced that the album would be made into a Broadway musical by &quot;The West Wing&quot; creator Aaron Sorkin and director Des McAnuff. Frontman Wayne Coyne said of the plot:
Des McAnuff stated that Aaron Sorkin exited the project after it became clear the musical would be sung-through. The musical includes existing songs from the album, as well as two other Flaming Lips albums, &quot;The Soft Bulletin&quot; and &quot;At War with the Mystics&quot;. The show received its world premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in November 2012, starring Kimiko Glenn as Yoshimi Yasukawa, Paul Nolan as Ben Nickel, Nik Walker as Booker, Pearl Sun as Mrs. Yasukawa, John Haggerty as Mr. Yasukawa and Tom Hewitt as Dr. Petersen.

<text>Malum prohibitum (plural &quot;mala prohibita&quot;, literal translation: &quot;wrong [as or because] prohibited&quot;) is a Latin phrase used in law to refer to conduct that constitutes an unlawful act only by virtue of statute, as opposed to conduct that is evil in and of itself, or &quot;malum in se&quot;.

Conduct that is so clearly violative of society&#x27;s standards for allowable conduct that it is illegal under English common law is usually regarded as &quot;malum in se&quot;. An offense that is &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; may not appear on the face to directly violate moral standards. The distinction between these two cases is discussed in &quot;State of Washington v. Thaddius X. Anderson&quot;:

Examples of offenses that are generally regarded as &quot;mala prohibita&quot; include disorderly conduct, gambling, possession of a controlled substance, prostitution, public intoxication, resisting arrest, speeding, and vagrancy.

<doc id="448714" wikidata="Q166247" url="?curid=448714" title="American Viticultural Area">
<text>An American Viticultural Area (AVA) is a designated wine grape-growing region in the United States, providing an official appellation for the mutual benefit of wineries and consumers. Winemakers frequently want their consumers to know about the geographic pedigree of their wines, as wines from a particular area can possess distinctive characteristics. Consumers often seek out wines from specific AVAs, and certain wines of particular pedigrees can claim premium prices and loyal customers. If a wine is labeled with an AVA, at least 85% of the grapes that make up the wine must have been grown in the AVA, and the wine must be fully finished within the state where the AVA is located.

== Regulations ==
Since 1980, the boundaries of AVAs were defined by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), an independent bureau within the United States Department of the Treasury that received and handled petitions for viticultural areas, wine production and labeling. On January 2003, under the provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the ATF was extensively reorganized and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) was created to oversee wine production, labeling and viticultural areas. 

Section 4.25(e)(2) of the regulations (27 C.F.R. § 4.25(e)(2)) outlines the procedure for proposing an AVA and provides that any interested party may petition the TTB to establish a grape-growing region as an AVA. Section 9.12 of the TTB regulations (27 C.F.R. § 9.12) prescribes the standards for petitions for the establishment or modification of AVAs. Petitions to establish an AVA must include the following: 
* Evidence that the area within the proposed AVA boundary is nationally or locally known by the AVA name specified in the petition; 
* An explanation of the basis for defining the boundary of the proposed AVA; 
* A narrative description of the features of the proposed AVA affecting viticulture, such as climate, geology, soils, physical features, and elevation, that make the proposed AVA distinctive and distinguish it from adjacent areas outside the proposed AVA; 
* The appropriate United States Geological Survey (USGS) map(s) showing the location of the proposed AVA, with the boundary of the proposed AVA clearly drawn thereon; 
* An explanation of how of the proposed AVA is sufficiently distinct from an existing AVA so as to warrant separate recognition, if the proposed AVA is to be established within, or overlapping, an existing AVA; and 
* A detailed narrative description of the proposed AVA boundary based on USGS map markings.
Once a petition is accepted as complete, the TTB may choose to seek public input on the proposal and at its sole discretion may approve the proposed AVA. 

Before the AVA system, wine appellations of origin in the United States were designated based on state or county boundaries. All of these appellations were grandfathered into federal regulations and may appear on wine labels as designated places of origin in lieu of an AVA, such as Sonoma County. In order for a wine to be labeled with a state or county appellation, at least 75% of the grapes used to make the wine must have been grown within the boundary of the appellation, and the wine must be fully finished within the state in which the appellation is located. Some states have more stringent rules, such as California, which requires 100% of the grapes used to make the wine be from California and that the wine be fully finished within the state. Washington requires 95% of the grapes in a Washington wine be grown in Washington, although notably the Columbia Valley AVA, Columbia Gorge AVA, and Walla Walla Valley AVA are shared with Oregon.

== Around the country ==
AVAs vary widely in size, ranging from the Upper Mississippi River Valley AVA, at more than 19 million acres () across four states (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin), to the Cole Ranch AVA in Mendocino County, California, at only . 

The Augusta AVA, which occupies the area around the town of Augusta, Missouri, was the first recognized AVA, gaining the status on June 20, 1980. There are currently 276 AVAs spread across 34 states, with over half (154) in California.

An AVA may be located within one or more larger AVAs. For example, the Santa Clara Valley AVA and Livermore Valley AVA are located within the boundaries of the San Francisco Bay AVA, which is itself located within the Central Coast AVA. In such cases, the wine may be labeled with any of the relevant AVAs, but winemakers generally label wines with the most specific AVA allowed for each wine. Smaller AVAs are often perceived to be associated with smaller production and higher quality wines, though this is not always the case. See map on the right showing the outline of the Paso Robles AVA, California&#x27;s largest in total area, and the eleven distinct AVAs contained within it. 

In 2018, the second session of the 115th Congress recognized the contribution of American Viticultural Areas to the economy. The Blunt-Merkley Resolution passed unanimously. It noted that an AVA allows vintners to describe more accurately the origin of their wine, while helping vintners to build and enhance the reputation and value of the wines produced. AVAs also allow consumers to attribute a given quality, reputation, or other characteristic to a wine made from grapes grown in an AVA. AVAs also help consumers identify what they purchase.

<text>William Daniel Leahy () (6 May 1875 – 20 July 1959) was an American naval officer. The most senior United States military officer on active duty during World War II, he held several titles and exercised considerable influence over foreign and military policy. As a fleet admiral, he was the first flag officer ever to hold a five-star rank in the U.S. Armed Forces.

An 1897 graduate of Annapolis, Leahy saw active service in the Spanish–American War, the Philippine–American War, the Boxer Rebellion in China, the Banana Wars in Central America, and World War I. He was the first member of his cadet class to reach flag rank, as the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance from 1927 to 1931. He subsequently served as Chief of the Bureau of Navigation from 1933 to 1936, and commanded the Battle Fleet from 1936 to 1937. As Chief of Naval Operations from 1937 to 1939, he was the senior officer in the United States Navy, overseeing the expansion of the fleet and preparations for war.

After retiring from the Navy, Leahy was appointed the governor of Puerto Rico in 1939 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his most controversial role, he served as the Ambassador to France from 1940 to 1942. American policy was aimed at keeping the government of Vichy France free of German control, but Leahy had limited success. He came to believe that the United States should back Free France instead of Vichy France, and asked to be recalled after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the war.

Leahy was recalled to active duty as the Chief of Staff to the President in 1942 and served in that position for the rest of the war. He was the highest-ranking active-duty member of the military. As the &quot;de facto&quot; first Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he oversaw all of the American armed forces. He also presided over the American delegation to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. He was a major decision-maker during the war and was second only to the President in authority and influence. Leahy was promoted to five-star rank in December 1944. He served Roosevelt&#x27;s successor Harry S. Truman, helping shape postwar foreign policy until he retired in 1949. Although he did not oppose the use of the nuclear weapons during the war, in the post-war period he rejected war plans that placed too much emphasis on the first use of nuclear weapons.

==Early life and education==

William Daniel Leahy was born in Hampton, Iowa, on 6 May 1875, the first of seven children of Michael Anthony Leahy, a lawyer and American Civil War veteran, who was elected to the Iowa Legislature in 1872, and his wife Rose Mary Hamilton. Both parents were born in the United States but his grandparents were immigrants from Ireland. He had five brothers and a sister. His father was re-elected in 1874, but moved to Wausau, Wisconsin, in 1882. In 1889, the family moved again, this time to Ashland, Wisconsin, where Leahy attended high school. His nose was broken in an American football match and his family lacked the money to get it fixed, so it remained crooked for the rest of his life.

Leahy wanted to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, but this required a Congressional appointment, and Leahy was unable to secure one. His local congressman, Thomas Lynch, offered Leahy an appointment to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, which was much less popular among boys in the landlocked Midwestern United States. Leahy passed the entrance examinations and was admitted as a naval cadet in May 1893. 

Leahy learned how to sail on the on a summer cruise to Europe, although the vessel only made it as far as the Azores before breaking down. He graduated 35th out of 47 in the class of 1897. His class was the most successful ever: five of its members would reach four-star rank while on active duty: Leahy, Thomas C. Hart, Arthur J. Hepburn, Orin G. Murfin and Harry E. Yarnell. , no other class has had more than four.

==Naval service==
===Spanish-American War===
Until 1912, naval cadets graduating from Annapolis had to complete two years&#x27; duty at sea and pass examinations before they could be commissioned as ensigns. Leahy was assigned to the battleship , which was then at Vancouver, British Columbia, for celebrations of Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. He was on board when she made a dash through the Strait of Magellan, and around South America in the spring of 1898 to participate in the Spanish–American War. The &quot;Oregon&quot; took part in the blockade and bombardment of Santiago and shelled the small town of Guantánamo, which Leahy felt was &quot;unnecessary and cruel&quot;. In the Battle of Santiago on 3 July, Leahy was in command of the ship&#x27;s forward turret. This was the only naval battle Leahy witnessed in person.

Seeking further action, Leahy volunteered to serve on the gunboat , which was bound for the war in the Pacific, traveling via the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal, but he got only as far as Ceylon when he received orders to report to Annapolis for his final ensign&#x27;s examinations. He was therefore left behind, and had to return to the United States on the . He reached Annapolis in June 1899. He passed his examinations, and was commissioned as an ensign on 1 July 1899. After few weeks&#x27; leave, spent with his parents in Wisconsin, and a few months&#x27; service on the cruiser at the Mare Island Navy Yard, he joined the monitor on 12 October 1899. A week later it set sail for the Philippines. It arrived in Manila on 24 November, and Leahy rejoined the crew of the &quot;Castine&quot; five days later.

===China and Philippine–American Wars===
On 17 December 1899, &quot;Castine&quot; sailed for Nagasaki, but it developed engine trouble on 12 February 1900 and stopped in Shanghai to make repairs. While it was there the Boxer Rebellion broke out in China, and it was retained in Shanghai to help British, French and Japanese forces guard the city, although Leahy did not like their chances if the 4,500 Chinese troops in the vicinity joined the uprising, as they had in the Battle of Tientsin. On 28 August, the &quot;Castine&quot; was ordered to Amoy help protect American interests there against the possibility of a Japanese coup. After the threat had passed, the &quot;Castine&quot; returned to the Philippines, arriving back in Manila on 16 September 1900.
The Philippine–American War was still ongoing, and the &quot;Castine&quot; supported American operations on Marinduque and Iloilo. Leahy was appalled by American brutality and the widespread use of torture. Still an ensign, he was given his first command, the gunboat , a refitted ex-Spanish vessel. It had a crew of 23. His period in command ended when the &quot;Mariveles&quot; lost one of its propellers and had to be laid up for repairs. He was then reassigned to the , a stores ship which was engaged in bringing supplies from Australia to the Philippines. While in the Philippines he passed the examinations required for promotion to lieutenant, junior grade, and was promoted to that rank on 1 July 1902. He made his final trip to the Philippines in September 1902, and returned to the United States later that year.

Sea duty alternated with duty ashore. Leahy was assigned to the training ship in San Francisco, where he was promoted to lieutenant on 31 December 1903. He met and courted Louise Tennent Harrington. Leahy married Louise on 3 February 1904. Louise subsequently convinced him to convert to Episcopalianism.

Leahy helped commission the cruiser but swapped assignments with an officer on the so that he could remain in San Francisco with Louise, who was pregnant. Over the next two years the &quot;Boston&quot; cruised back and forth between San Francisco and Panama, where the Panama Canal was under construction. He was in Acapulco when their son and only child, William Harrington Leahy, was born on 27 October 1904, and did not see his son until five months later. He was present for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. His family had to leave their house in the face of the resulting fires. It survived undamaged, although they had to live in a hotel for several months before they could return.
On 22 February 1907, Leahy returned to Annapolis as instructor in the department of physics and chemistry. He also coached the academy rifle team. After two years ashore, he received orders on 14 August 1909, to return to San Francisco and sea duty as navigator of the armored cruiser , commanded by Captain Henry T. Mayo, in whom Leahy found a patron and a role model. In September, the &quot;California&quot; was one of eight ships that paid an official visit to Japan, where Leahy saw Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō. Mayo switched Leahy&#x27;s assignment from navigator to gunnery officer.

Leahy was promoted to lieutenant commander on 15 September 1909, and in January 1911, the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet, Rear Admiral Chauncey Thomas Jr., chose him as his fleet gunnery officer. In October, the &quot;California&quot; returned to San Francisco for a fleet review in honor of President William Howard Taft, and Leahy served as Taft&#x27;s temporary naval aide for four days.

===Banana Wars===
Rear Admiral William H. H. Southerland succeeded Thomas as commander of the Pacific Fleet on 21 April 1912. The &quot;California&quot; sailed to Manila and then to Japan before returning to San Francisco on 15 August. A few weeks later, Southerland received orders to proceed to Nicaragua and be prepared to deploy a landing force for the United States occupation of Nicaragua. Along with his duties as gunnery officer, Leahy became the chief of staff of the expeditionary force and the commander of the small garrison at Corinto, Nicaragua. He came under fire while repeatedly escorting reinforcements and supplies over the railroad line to León. Privately, he thought that the United States was backing the wrong side, propping up a conservative elite who were exploiting the Nicaraguan people.

In October 1912, Leahy came ashore in Washington, D.C., as assistant director of gunnery exercises and engineering competitions. Then, in 1913, Mayo had him assigned to the Bureau of Navigation as a detail officer. Mayo and then his replacement, Rear Admiral William Fullam, were reassigned, leaving Leahy as the acting chief of the bureau. It was one of the Navy&#x27;s most sensitive offices, as it controlled officer assignments. Leahy&#x27;s wife Louise enjoyed the social milieu of Washington, and socialized with Addie Daniels, the wife of Josephus Daniels, the Secretary of the Navy. Leahy established a close friendship with the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
As Leahy&#x27;s three-year tour of shore duty approached its end in 1915, he hoped to command the new destroyer tender but Daniels had the assignment changed to command of the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s dispatch gunboat, the . Leahy assumed command of the &quot;Dolphin&quot; on 18 September 1915. The ship took part in the United States occupation of Haiti, where Leahy again acted as chief of staff, this time to Rear Admiral William B. Caperton. In May 1916, &quot;Dolphin&quot; participated in the occupation of the Dominican Republic too. During the summer, Roosevelt used it as his family yacht, cruising down the Hudson River from the Roosevelt family estate in Hyde Park, New York, and along the coast to his holiday house on Campobello Island. Leahy was promoted to commander on 29 August 1916.

===World War I===
Following the United States entry into World War I In April 1917, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was sent to the United States Virgin Islands to assert America&#x27;s control there. There was a rumor that a Danish-flagged freighter in the vicinity, the &quot;Nordskov&quot;, was a German merchant raider in disguise, and &quot;Dolphin&quot; was sent to investigate. If it had been, Leahy would have been outgunned, but an inspection determined that the rumors were false. In July 1917, Leahy became the executive officer of . It was the Navy&#x27;s newest battleship, but it was not sent to Europe due to with its new design and a shortage of fuel oil in Britain.

In April 1918 Leahy assumed command of a troop transport, the . Shortly before it was due to depart for France, Leahy was summoned to Washington, D.C., by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral William S. Benson, who offered him the position of the Navy&#x27;s director of gunnery. Leahy told him that he wanted to remain on the &quot;Princess Matoika&quot;. A compromise was reached; Leahy was permitted to cross the Atlantic once before becoming director of gunnery. Traveling in convoy, the &quot;Princess Matoika&quot; reached Brest on 23 May 1918, and disembarked its troops. Leahy was awarded the Navy Cross &quot;for distinguished service in the line of his profession as commanding officer of the USS &quot;Princess Matoika&quot;, engaged in the important, exacting and hazardous duty of transporting and escorting troops and supplies to European ports through waters infested with enemy submarines and mines during World War I.&quot;

Leahy returned to the United States, where he was promoted to captain on 1 July 1918, and soon after was on his way back to Europe to confer with representatives of the Royal Navy and discuss their gunnery practices. He reached London later that month, where he reported to the U.S. Navy commander in Europe, Vice Admiral William S. Sims, who had been a critic of the Navy&#x27;s gunnery in the Spanish-American War. Leahy met with his British counterpart, Captain Frederic Dreyer, and the chief gunnery officer of the Anglo-American Grand Fleet, Captain Ernle Chatfield.

Leahy was attached to the staff of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman, the commander of the American division of the Grand Fleet, and was able to view a gunnery exercise from the British battleship . On the way home he visited Paris, where he was appalled at the German use of a long-range gun to bombard the city, which he considered an indiscriminate targeting of civilians and militarily useless. He embarked for home on the at Brest on 12 August 1918.

===Sea duty between the wars===

In February 1921, Leahy sailed for Europe, where he assumed command of the cruiser on 2 April. In May he was ordered to take command of the cruiser , the flagship of the naval detachment in Turkish waters during the Greco-Turkish War. He was able to spend a couple of weeks in the French countryside with Louise, who spoke fluent French, before taking the Orient Express to Constantinople, where he reported to the American commander there, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, on 30 May. Leahy had the role of safeguarding American interests in Turkey. He had to play the diplomat, attending parties and receptions, and organizing American events. He reveled in this assignment.

The next step in a successful naval career would normally have been to attend the Naval War College. Leahy submitted repeated requests but was never sent. At the end of 1921, he was given command of the minelayer and concurrent command of Mine Squadron One. He then returned to Washington, D.C., where he served as director of Officer Personnel in the Bureau of Navigation from 1923 to 1926. After three years of shore duty, he was given command of the battleship . In biennial competitions in gunnery, engineering and battle efficiency, the &quot;New Mexico&quot; won all three in 1927–1928.

===Flag officer===
On 14 October 1927, he reached flag rank, the first member of his cadet class to do so, and returned to Washington as the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance. The following year he bought a town house on Florida Avenue near Dupont Circle for $20,000 (). He also had assets that he had acquired through his marriage to Louise: stocks in the Colusa County Bank and agricultural land in the Sacramento Valley in California. In the wake of the Wall Street crash of 1929, President Herbert Hoover determined to effect cuts in the Navy&#x27;s budget, and his representative, Rear Admiral William V. Pratt, negotiated the London Naval Treaty that limited naval construction. The list of canceled ships included two aircraft carriers, three cruisers, a destroyer and six submarines. Leahy was in charge of implementing these cuts, and he was appalled at the human toll; some 5,000 workers lost their jobs, many of them highly skilled shipyard workers who faced long-term unemployment during the Great Depression.
Admiral Charles F. Hughes elected to retire rather than enforce the cuts, and he was replaced by Pratt. Pratt and Leahy soon clashed over cuts to shipbuilding, and Pratt attempted to have Leahy reassigned as chief of staff of the Pacific Fleet. Leahy had the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation block this, but decided that it would be in his best interest to get away from Pratt, and he secured command of the destroyers of the Scouting Force on the West Coast in 1931. Leahy&#x27;s dislike of Hoover was intensified by his dire personal circumstances. He could not find a tenant for the Florida Avenue property at a rent that would pay for its upkeep; the price of food had fallen so much that his land in the Sacramento Valley could not generate a profit, and was seized by the government to recover unpaid taxes; and a run on the bank in January 1933 caused the Colusa County Bank to close its doors, taking with it Leahy&#x27;s life savings, and leaving him with a large debt that he would not pay off until 1941.

Roosevelt was inaugurated as president on 4 March 1933, and he nominated Leahy as the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. On 6 May 1933, Leahy and Louise boarded a train back to Washington, D.C. As bureau chief, Leahy handled personnel matters with care and consideration. When his successor as the Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance, Rear Admiral Edgar B. Larimer, suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized, Leahy ensured that he was kept on the active list until he reached retirement age, thereby safeguarding his pension. When two midshipmen at Annapolis, John Hyland and Victor Krulak, faced expulsion for failing to reach the required minimum height of , Leahy waived the regulations to permit them to graduate with the class of 1934, and both went on to have distinguished careers.
Leahy formed a good working relationship with the new Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Henry L. Roosevelt, an Annapolis graduate and distant cousin of the President whom Leahy considered a close personal friend, but he clashed with the new CNO, Admiral William H. Standley, who sought to assert the power of the CNO over the bureau chiefs. In this he was opposed by Leahy and the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, who enlisted the aid of Henry Roosevelt and the Secretary of the Navy, Claude A. Swanson, to block it. In 1936, the commander-in-chief United States Fleet (CINCUS), Admiral Joseph M. Reeves recommended Leahy for the position of Commander Battleships Battle Force, with the rank of vice admiral. Standley was opposed to this, but was unable to persuade Swanson or the President, who invited Leahy to a private chat at the White House before proceeding to take up his new posting.

Leahy assumed his new command on 13 July 1935. In October Roosevelt came out to California for the California Pacific International Exposition. Leahy treated him to the largest fleet maneuver the U.S. Navy had ever carried out, with 129 warships, including 12 battleships, participating, which the President observed from the deck of the cruiser . On 30 March 1936, Leahy was promoted to the temporary rank of admiral and hoisted his four-star flag on the battleship as Commander Battle Force. One of his last acts in this post was a symbolic one: he transferred his flag to the aircraft carrier as a sign of his conviction that aircraft were now an integral part of sea power.

===Chief of Naval Operations===
In December 1935, Swanson told Leahy in confidence that he would be appointed the next CNO if Roosevelt won the 1936 presidential election. Roosevelt won the election with a landslide victory, and on 10 November 1936, it was announced that Leahy would succeed Standley as CNO on 1 January 1937. As CNO, Leahy was content to let the bureau chiefs function as they always had, acting as a &quot;primus inter pares&quot;. Swanson was chronically ill, and Henry Roosevelt died on 22 February 1936. Charles Edison became the new assistant secretary, but he lacked experience in naval affairs.
Leahy began representing the Navy in cabinet meetings. He met with the President frequently; during his tenure as CNO, Roosevelt had 52 meetings with Leahy, compared with twelve with his Army counterpart, General Malin Craig, and none of the meetings with Craig were private lunches. Meetings between Leahy and Roosevelt were sometimes on matters unrelated to the Navy, and they frequently went on for hours. At one private lunch on 15 April 1937, Leahy and Roosevelt debated whether new battleships should have 16-inch () or (cheaper) 14-inch () guns. Leahy ultimately persuaded the President that the new s should have 16-inch guns. On 22 May, Leahy accompanied the President and dignitaries including John Nance Garner, Harry Hopkins, James F. Byrnes, Morris Sheppard, Edwin C. Johnson, Claude Pepper and Sam Rayburn on a cruise on the presidential yacht to watch a baseball game between congressmen and the press.

The most important issue confronting the administration was how to respond to the Japanese invasion of China. The commander-in-chief of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Harry Yarnell, asked for four more cruisers to help evacuate American citizens from the Shanghai International Settlement, but the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, thought this would be too provocative. Leahy went to Hyde Park to take the matter up with Roosevelt. The request was turned down: American isolationist sentiment was too strong to countenance the risk of being drawn into the conflict; Yarnell could use merchant ships, if he could find them. Leahy accepted this presidential decision, as he always did, even when he strongly disagreed. Leahy wrote in his diary that a Japanese threat to bomb the civilian population in China was &quot;evidence, and a conclusive one, that the old accepted rules of warfare are no longer in effect.&quot;
On 12 December, Leahy was informed of the USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident, in which an American gunboat on the Yangtze River had been sunk by Japanese aircraft. He met with Hull to craft a response, and discussed the matter with Roosevelt on 14 December. Leahy saw the &quot;Panay&quot; incident as a test of American resolve. He wanted to answer it with a show of force, economic sanctions and a naval blockade of Japan. But among Roosevelt&#x27;s advisors, he was the only one willing to countenance such a drastic step. Roosevelt agreed with him, but in an election year he felt he could not afford to antagonize the pacifists and isolationists. The Japanese apology therefore was accepted.

The &quot;Panay&quot; incident did prompt Roosevelt and Leahy to press ahead with plans for an ambitious shipbuilding program. On 5 January, Roosevelt, Leahy and Edison met with Congressman Carl Vinson to draw up a strategy for obtaining Congressional approval for a 20 percent increase in all classes of warships. The resulting Second Vinson Act was approved in May 1938, and provided for four more s. Leahy had not thought it worthwhile to build more aircraft carriers, but five were added to what became the Two-Ocean Navy Act, together with five s. Leahy pushed for the construction of 24 oilers, which would be needed to project American sea power across the Pacific. Leahy joined Louise when she sponsored the first of these, the , which was commissioned on 20 March 1939.

Roosevelt threw a surprise party for Leahy on 28 July 1939, during which he presented him with the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. According to Leahy, Roosevelt said: &quot;Bill, if we have a war, you&#x27;re going to be right back here helping me run it.&quot; To make this easier, legislation was expedited to keep Leahy on the active list for another two years. On 1 August 1939, Admiral Harold Stark replaced Leahy as CNO.

==Government service==
===Governor of Puerto Rico===

From September 1939 to November 1940, Leahy served as Governor of Puerto Rico after Roosevelt removed Blanton Winship for his role in the Ponce massacre. Winship had aligned himself with the Coalición, a pro-American electoral alliance that represented the interests of the island&#x27;s wealthy elite and American sugar corporations. Roosevelt gave Leahy the objectives of developing and upgrading base installations, and of alleviating the extreme poverty and inequality. Leahy was given an $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in addition to funds already earmarked for the island and extraordinary latitude in spending it. He was also named as the head of the Puerto Rican office of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which gave him control over New Deal funding. In October 1939, he also became the head of the Puerto Rico Cement Corporation to help it secure a $700,000 loan () from the Federal government&#x27;s Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC), and in December he became the head of the Puerto Rican branch of the RFC. His power was enhanced by his direct access to the President and the Secretary of the interior, Harold L. Ickes.

Although given the unflattering sobriquet &quot;Almirante Lija&quot; (&quot;Admiral Sandpaper&quot;) by locals, based on his surname, Luis Muñoz Marín came to regard Leahy as &quot;by far the best governor that has been sent to Puerto Rico since the beginning of the American Regime.&quot; Leahy took an open stance of not intervening directly in the politics of Puerto Rico, although he remained involved in federal politics, doing what he could to support Roosevelt&#x27;s 1940 reelection. He attempted to understand and respect local customs, and initiated major public works projects. Although his priority was developing Puerto Rico as a military base, over half the WPA funds were spent on public works such as roads and improving sanitation. He regulated prices and production in the coffee industry, and had ships traveling between the United States and the Panama Canal, where major upgrade works were being undertaken, stop over in Puerto Rico when they needed repairs or supplies. In December 1939 he met with Roosevelt and secured another $100 million in WPA funding (equivalent to $ million in ) for public works, which allowed him to hire another 20,000 workers. By awarding lucrative government contracts and appointing officials based on Roosevelt&#x27;s preferences rather than those of the local elite, he soon earned the enmity of the Coalición.

Leahy oversaw the development of military bases and stations across the island. At the time of his appointment as governor, the only naval installations were a radio station and a hydrographic office. On 30 October 1939, a fixed-price contract was awarded for construction of the Naval Air Station Isla Grande. The scope was widened to include the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station; construction work there commenced in 1941 under another fixed-price contract and the base was commissioned on 15 July 1943.

Between 1 January and 1 November 1940, Leahy met with Roosevelt six times. One of the most important was a lunch on 6 October 1940. Admiral James O. Richardson, the CINCUS, had been ordered to keep the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor to act as a deterrent to the Japanese. Richardson protested that Pearl Harbor was unsuitable as a base and was too vulnerable to a surprise attack. Leahy agreed, but knew better than to press the matter with Roosevelt when his mind was made up. On 1 February 1941, Richardson was recalled.
===Ambassador to France===
Henry L. Stimson and McGeorge Bundy described the Fall of France in June 1940 as &quot;the most shocking single event of the war&quot;. American security had been underwritten by Britain and France, allowing the United States to have comparatively low defense spending. Planning was based on the assumption that France would be a bulwark against Germany, as it had been in World War I, and the United States would have ample time to mobilize industry and create armies. Now, with France gone, Germany could directly threaten the United States. On 18 November 1940, Leahy was appointed United States Ambassador to France. In his message asking Leahy to accept the position, Roosevelt explained: 
&quot;My major task&quot;, Leahy later recalled &quot;was to keep the French on our side in so far as possible&quot;. He hoped to convince Pétain and the Commander-in-Chief of the French Navy, Admiral François Darlan, that it was in France&#x27;s best interest that Germany be defeated. He departed Norfolk, Virginia, on the cruiser on 17 December 1940, and presented his letter of credence to Pétain in Vichy on 9 January 1941.

Leahy had some levers with which to influence the French to moderate collaboration with the Axis Powers. He advised Roosevelt that shipments of food and medical aid to France would improve America&#x27;s standing and stiffen Pétain&#x27;s resolve. In his opinion, the &quot;British blockade action which prevents the delivery of necessary foodstuffs to the inhabitants of unoccupied France is of the same order of stupidity as many other British policies in the present war.&quot; He suggested that aid to French North Africa would also strengthen the hand of General Maxime Weygand, the French Delegate-General in North Africa, in resisting Axis demands. Roosevelt compelled the British to accept the shipment of food and medicine for children, along with thousands of tons of fuel intended for their distribution.

American aid proved insufficient to buy French support. In May 1941, Darlan agreed to the Paris Protocols, which granted Germany access to French military bases in Syria, Tunisia, and French West Africa, and in July the French granted Japan access to bases in French Indochina, which directly threatened the American position in the Philippines. Although no German bombers had the range to bomb the United States from bases in Senegal, if they could deploy to Vichy-held Martinique, they could do so from there.

Weygand, the main American hope for a change in French policy, was recalled on 18 November 1941, despite Leahy&#x27;s warnings that this could prompt a cession of American aid. On 7 December, Leahy received news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. This was followed, on 11 December, by the German declaration of war against the United States. Leahy thought the United States&#x27;s entry into the war would strengthen his hand with the Vichy government, but Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s capture of Saint Pierre and Miquelon later that month discredited American assurances that French colonies would not be seized.

By this time Leahy was convinced that the United States should back Free France instead of Vichy France, and he unsuccessfully urged Roosevelt to use the capture of Saint Pierre and Miquelon as a pretext for recalling him to the United States. After the formation of a new government in Vichy under the pro-Axis Pierre Laval on 18 April, Leahy again requested he be recalled in order to distance the United States from Laval, and Washington officials agreed. Meanwhile, on 9 April, Leahy&#x27;s wife Louise underwent a hysterectomy. While recovering from the operation, she suffered an embolism and died on 21 April. Leahy called on Pétain to say farewell on 27 April. He arrived back in New York on the Swedish-registered ocean liner on 1 June. He arranged for a funeral service for Louise at the St. Thomas Episcopal Church, where they had been members for many years, and watched her burial in Arlington National Cemetery on 3 June 1942. Reflecting on her loss, Leahy would write that Louise&#x27;s death had &quot;left me not only crushed with sorrow, but permanently less than half efficient for any work the future may have in store for me and completely uninterested in the remaining future.&quot;

==Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief==
===Organization and role===
Waging a two-ocean war as part of a coalition revealed serious deficiencies in the organization of the American high command when it came to formulating grand strategy: meetings of the senior officers of the Army and Navy with each other and with the President were irregular and infrequent, and there was no joint planning staff or secretariat to record decisions taken. Under the Constitution of the United States, the President was the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy. At a meeting with Roosevelt on 24 February 1942, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George C. Marshall, urged Roosevelt to appoint a chief of staff of the armed forces to provide unity of command, and he suggested Leahy for the role. Leahy had lunch with Roosevelt on 7 July, during which this was discussed. On 21 July, Leahy was recalled to active duty. He resigned as Ambassador to France and was appointed Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy. In announcing the appointment, Roosevelt described Leahy&#x27;s role as an advisory one rather than that of a supreme commander.
Leahy attended his first meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) on 28 July 1942. The other members were Marshall; King, who was now both CNO and Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet (now abbreviated as COMINCH); and Lieutenant General Henry H. Arnold, the Chief of U.S. Army Air Forces. Henceforth, the JCS held regular meetings at noon on Wednesdays, which usually commenced with a light lunch. Leahy served as the de facto chairman. He drew up the agenda for the JCS meetings, presided over them, and signed off on all the major papers and decisions. He considered that this was due to his seniority and not by virtue of his position. He had a small personal staff of two military aides-de-camp and two or three secretaries. JCS meetings were held in the Public Health Service Building, where Leahy had an office. After some renovations were made, he was also given an office in the East Wing of the White House on 7 September 1942; the other two main offices there were occupied by Harry Hopkins and James F. Byrnes. Roosevelt had the Map Room constructed in the White House where large maps showed the progress of the war. Only Leahy and Hopkins had unrestricted access to the Map Room; everyone else had to be accompanied by Leahy or Hopkins or given special permission to enter.

Two days after his first JCS meeting, there was a meeting of the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCS), which Leahy also chaired. In these meetings the JCS met with the leaders of the British Joint Staff Mission: Field Marshal Sir John Dill, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham, Air Marshal Douglas Evill and Lieutenant General Gordon Macready. CCS meetings were held every Friday. The main agendum item at his first JCS and CCS meetings was Operation Gymnast, a proposed invasion of French North Africa. Marshall and King were opposed to it on the grounds that it would divert resources necessary for Operation Roundup, a landing in northern France, but after listening to their arguments, Leahy informed them Roosevelt was adamant that it was vital American forces take the field against Germany in 1942, and that Gymnast was to proceed. Roosevelt gave his formal assent on 25 July. Marshall and King considered this to be tentative, but Leahy informed them that the decision was final.

Leahy usually arrived at his White House office sometime between 08:30 and 08:45 and went over copies of dispatches and reports. For convenience, the documents were color coded: pink for incoming dispatches from the theater; yellow for outgoing ones; green for JCS papers; white for CCS ones; and blue for papers from the Joint Staff Planners. Leahy would select the papers to be brought to the President&#x27;s attention, and would meet with him each morning in the Oval Office or the Map Room. This included high-grade Ultra intelligence. Control of the flow of information gave Leahy a further source of power and influence beyond his personal relationship with the President.

=== Grand strategy ===
When Roosevelt travelled overseas, Leahy went with him. Leahy missed the Casablanca Conference in January 1943; after setting out with Roosevelt, Hopkins and Rear Admiral Ross McIntire, Leahy developed bronchitis and had to remain in Trinidad. But he was present at all the other inter-Allied conferences that the President attended. Leahy&#x27;s support of Roosevelt&#x27;s decision to invade French North Africa did not mean that he bought into the British Mediterranean strategy. He joined Marshall and King in their advocacy of a cross-Channel operation in 1944. At the first conference he attended, the Third Washington Conference, in May 1943 he clashed with the British chiefs of staff over their reluctance to undertake operations to reopen the overland route to China, which Leahy considered vital to both the war against Japan and the postwar era. Leahy eventually extracted a promise from the British to undertake Operation Anakim, an offensive to recapture Burma, in 1943. Leahy sided with Hopkins and Major General Claire Chennault in supporting a bombing offensive against Japan from bases in China despite Marshall&#x27;s prescient warnings that this could not be sustained without adequate ground troops to protect the air bases. Marshall was proven correct when a Japanese offensive overran Chennault&#x27;s bases.
On 12 November 1943, Roosevelt, Hopkins, Leahy, King and Marshall set off together from Hampton Roads on the battleship . Roosevelt occupied the captain&#x27;s cabin, and Leahy the one for an embarked admiral. They reached Mers-el-Kebir on 20 November, from whence they flew to Tunis and then Cairo. Roosevelt stayed at the American Ambassador&#x27;s compound in Cairo. Space was limited, so he took only Leahy and Hopkins with him. Discussions with the British were mainly concerned with Burma and China, about which they had much less interest than the Americans.

They then flew on to Tehran, Iran, for talks with Stalin. Roosevelt was slated to stay at the American legation there, but Stalin offered to put him up at the Soviet compound. He was allowed to bring two people with him, so he chose Leahy and Hopkins. The conference reached agreement with the Soviets on the cross-Channel operation (Operation Overlord) and an invasion of Southern France (Operation Anvil). When General Sir Alan Brooke began to back away from the commitment, Leahy lost his patience and demanded to know under what circumstances Brooke would be willing to undertake Overlord. The British, as Leahy put it, &quot;fell into line&quot;.

Although the conservative Leahy regarded Hopkins as a &quot;pinko&quot;, the two men worked well together, and Leahy became quite fond of Hopkins. Both were completely devoted to the President, and Leahy saw something of himself in the idealistic Hopkins. Over time, Leahy gradually replaced Hopkins as Roosevelt&#x27;s most trusted advisor, becoming, in the words of historian Phillips O&#x27;Brien, &quot;the second most powerful man in the world&quot;. The main reason for this was Hopkins&#x27; precarious health, as he had stomach cancer. He married Louise Gill Macy in the Yellow Oval Room on 30 July 1942, they moved out of the White House in December 1943. He was therefore no longer at Roosevelt&#x27;s beck and call.

Leahy spent D-Day, 6 June 1944, in his home town of Hampton, Iowa. This well-publicized &quot;sentimental journey&quot; was part of the deception efforts surrounding the Allied invasion of Europe. The idea was to lull any German agents in the United States into believing that the operation would not take place while such an important officer was out of the capital. The following month, he accompanied Roosevelt to the Pacific Strategy Conference in Hawaii at which they met with Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, the commander in chief of the Pacific Ocean Areas, and General Douglas MacArthur, the commander in chief of the Southwest Pacific Area.
Roosevelt, Leahy and presidential speech writer Samuel Rosenman (instead of Hopkins) set out from Washington in Roosevelt&#x27;s personal railcar, the &quot;Ferdinand Magellan&quot;, on 13 July. They went to Hyde Park, where Roosevelt showed Leahy around his Presidential Library, then to Chicago, where Roosevelt conferred with leaders of the Democratic Party over the choice of Harry S. Truman as his vice presidential running mate in the 1944 election. In San Diego they boarded the cruiser , which took them to Hawaii, where Nimitz briefed them on a proposed invasion of the island of Formosa, King&#x27;s preferred target, but also spoke favorably of MacArthur&#x27;s alternative of liberating the Philippines. Leahy hoped that this would facilitate a naval and air blockade that would make an invasion of Japan unnecessary. No decision was taken at this time, and the JCS continued debating the issue for months before authorizing the liberation of Luzon on 3 October.

Hopkins was not present at the Second Quebec Conference in September 1944 either, continuing Leahy&#x27;s transformation into a White House advisor. Leahy did not attend the political sessions at Quebec, but at this level political and military issues were indistinguishable. For example, the JCS examined a proposal for a British fleet to participate in the Pacific War, a military proposal with a political objective. King was unenthusiastic about the idea; the U.S. Navy was performing well against the Japanese, and the addition of British forces would complicate command and logistics arrangements. Leahy and Marshall pressed for the British offer to be accepted, and in the end it was, with the proviso that the British Pacific Fleet would be self-supporting.

Another debate concerned the American occupation zone in Germany. The United States was allocated the southern part of Germany, which meant that its lines of communications would run through France, where Leahy was concerned about the prospect of a postwar Communist takeover. Roosevelt and Churchill reached a compromise, whereby the ports of Bremen and Bremerhaven would be given to the Americans, along with the right of transit through the British Zone.

Leahy was advanced to the newly created rank of Fleet Admiral on 15 December 1944, making him the most senior of the seven men who received five-star rank that month. He accompanied President Roosevelt to the Yalta Conference in February 1945. The cruiser took them to Malta, where Leahy chaired a CCS meeting to discuss the war against Germany, and then the President&#x27;s personal aircraft, the &quot;Sacred Cow&quot;, flew them to Yalta. At Yalta, Roosevelt met Churchill and Stalin to decide how Europe was to be reorganized after the impending surrender of Germany.

On 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died. Leahy attended the ceremonies and the memorial service for his friend, which was held in the East Room of the White House.

===Atomic bomb===
On 13 April 1945, Leahy gave the regular morning briefing on the progress of the war to Truman, who had become president on Roosevelt&#x27;s death. This was followed by a short meeting with the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, and the Secretary of the Navy, James Forrestal. Afterwards, Leahy offered to resign, but Truman decided to retain him as chief of staff. On 18 June, the Joint Chiefs, along with Stimson and Forrestal, met with Truman at the White House to discuss Operation Olympic, the planned invasion of Kyushu. Truman chaired the meeting. Marshall and King strongly favored the operation, and all the others voiced their support except Leahy, who feared that it would result in high casualties. He questioned Marshall&#x27;s casualty estimates, which were based on the Luzon campaign, which took place on a large land mass where there was ample room for maneuver, rather than the Okinawa campaign, which took place on an island where lack of maneuver room resulted in frontal assaults and high casualties.

According to Truman&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs: Year of Decisions&quot;, Leahy was skeptical about the atomic bomb, saying: &quot;That is the biggest fool thing we have ever done. The bomb will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.&quot; After the bomb was tested and did explode, Truman consulted with Byrnes, Stimson, Leahy, Marshall, Arnold and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of United States Forces, European Theater. The consensus was that the atomic bomb should be used. Although Leahy later wrote in his memoirs that his &quot;own feeling was that in being the first to use it, we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages&quot;, historian Barton J. Bernstein noted that Leahy did not oppose its use at the time:

=== Truman administration===
In July 1945, Leahy accompanied Truman to the Potsdam Conference where Truman met with Stalin and the new British Prime Minister Clement Attlee to make decisions about the governance of occupied Germany. Hopkins was too ill to make the journey. Leahy was disappointed in the outcome of these conferences. He considered that both Truman and Stalin had suffered defeats, with proposals that would have ensured a lasting peace in Europe being watered down or turned down. He recognized that the Soviet Union was a dominant power in Europe, and that the British Empire was in terminal decline, underscored by the mid-conference replacement of Churchill by Attlee.
On 24 January 1946, Leahy was appointed to the interim National Intelligence Authority (NIA), which oversaw activities of the nascent Central Intelligence Group. The following year the National Security Act of 1947 replaced these organizations with the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency respectively, ending Leahy&#x27;s involvement. He continued to chair meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he rejected war plans that he felt placed too much emphasis on the first use of nuclear weapons.

Like many naval officers, he was opposed to the unification of the War and Navy departments into the Department of Defense, fearing that the Navy would lose its naval aviation and the Marine Corps. Nor did he agree with formalizing the role of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which he felt would place too much power in the hands of one individual. The position was created by amendments to the National Security Act that Truman signed into law on 10 August 1949, but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was not the single chief of staff the Army and Air Force wanted.

Leahy was involved in the preparation of two speeches that marked the onset of the Cold War: Truman&#x27;s Navy Day address on 27 October 1945, and Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech on 5 March 1946. The former was written by Leahy and Rosenman, and reflected Leahy&#x27;s ideas about the fundamental goals of U.S. foreign policy; the latter was written by Churchill, but in consultation with Leahy, who was the only one of the &quot;American military men&quot; referred to in the speech with whom Churchill discussed the speech. But Leahy&#x27;s non-interventionist stance on U.S. involvement in the Greek Civil War and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict were increasingly out of step with the policies of the Truman administration. On 20 September 1948, columnist Constantine Brown published allegations that White House advisors Clark Clifford and David K. Niles were urging Truman to get rid of Leahy, whom they regarded, Brown said, as an &quot;old-fashioned reactionary&quot;.

On the day after Truman won the presidential election on 2 November 1948, Leahy asked to be retired in January. In December, doctors diagnosed Leahy with a partial blockage of the kidneys. On 28 December, he met with Truman as chief of staff for the last time. Truman officially accepted his resignation as his chief of staff on 2 March 1949, although as an officer with five-star rank, Leahy technically remained on active service as an advisor to the Secretary of the Navy.

The following year, Leahy published his war memoirs, &quot;I Was There&quot;. His unemotional, unexciting and unenlightening style did his publisher no favors. Orville Prescott the book reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;As the personal confidant of President Roosevelt and President Truman, Admiral Leahy ought to have a good story to tell. Unfortunately, he hasn&#x27;t... its stiff official manner, its elaborate discretion, its desperate need of editing and its lack of any exciting new information make it dull and dusty fare... writes in a prose style as rigid as a naval cadet standing at attention in his review.&quot; The book sold poorly, and when Leahy subsequently proposed a book about his time in Puerto Rico, the publisher turned it down.

==Death and legacy==

Leahy died at the U.S. Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, on 20 July 1959, at the age of 84. At the time of his death, he was the oldest officer on active duty in the history of the U.S. Navy. He was given an Armed Forces military funeral. His body was viewed at the Bethlehem Chapel at the Washington National Cathedral from noon on 22 July 22 until noon the following day. A funeral service was then held in the cathedral at 14:00, followed by the burial in Arlington National Cemetery. Honorary pallbearers were Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, Admiral Charles P. Snyder, Admiral Louis E. Denfeld, Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Vice Admiral Edward L. Cochrane, and Rear Admiral Henry Williams, all retired from service. Active military servicemen who were honorary pallbearers were Admiral Jerauld Wright, Admiral Robert L. Dennison, Rear Admiral Joseph H. Wellings, and close friend, William D. Hassett.
Leahy&#x27;s papers are in the Naval History and Heritage Command and the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.; some personal correspondence is held by the Wisconsin Historical Society. , the lead ship of the s, was named in his honor. In 2014, Quarters BB at the Old Naval Observatory was renamed Leahy House. The order from Leahy to King and Marshall that ended hostilities in World War II was used to decorate the house&#x27;s mantelpiece.

<text>Lunda Norte () is a province of Angola. It has an area of 103,760 km² and a population of 862,566. Angola&#x27;s first President, Agostinho Neto, made Lucapa the provincial capital after independence, but the capital was later moved to Dundo. The province borders the Democratic Republic of Congo in the northeast and Lunda Sul in the south. The province is rich in gold and diamonds, but remains vastly underdeveloped and impoverished. UNITA used the money generated from the sale of diamonds to fund war efforts. Cuango River valley, the richest diamond area of Angola is located in the province. Mining is done by notable companies like DeBeers and Endiama. The Lunda province whose capital was Saurimo was created by the Portuguese colonial empire on July 13, 1895. It was divided into Lunda-Sul and Lunda-Norte subdivisions through a constitution act in 1978 by the People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) government. Iron and manganese mining are also important economic activities. It is well known for its sculptures. The most notable one is The Thinker (&quot;O Pensador&quot;), a sculpture of a man holding his head. It is rich in terms of flora and fauna.

Lunda Norte is populated by Chokwe, Lunda, and other ethnical groups. Ernesto Muangala is the current governor of the province. Lino dos Santos, Deolinda Odia Paulo Satula Vilarinho and Ângêlica Nené Curita Ihungo are the deputy governors for Technical and Infrastructure Services, Economic Sector Area and Political and Social Sector Area respectively. An ethnographic museum located in the province is visited by many tourists. During the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002) many civilians were killed in the clashes between National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). Diamond mining operations were also affected. Many landmines laid during the civil war are still present in the province. Leprosy and elephantiasis are major diseases which affect the province.

<doc id="448718" wikidata="Q994451" url="?curid=448718" title="Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)">
<text>Liang, known in historiography as the Western Liang (; 400–421), was a dynastic state of China listed as one of the Sixteen Kingdoms. The Western Liang was founded by the Li family of Han descent. The founder of the Tang dynasty, Li Yuan (Emperor Gaozu), traced his patrilineal ancestry to the Western Liang rulers and traced the ancestry of the Western Liang rulers to Li Guang, Li Xin, and Laozi in the paternal line. The ruling Li clan of the Western Liang was known as the Longxi Li lineage ().

All of Western Liang&#x27;s rulers declared themselves as &quot;gōng&quot;s (公), which is translated to &quot;Dukes&quot;. Their territory encompassed modern-day northwestern Gansu, and for this reason, they were given the prefix of &quot;Western&quot; in historiography to distinguish them with the other Liang states at the time.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Western Liang&#x27;s founder, Li Gao was from the Li clan of Longxi, a prominent Han Chinese family that claimed descent from figures such as Laozi, Li Xìn and Li Guang. Under the Western Jin and Former Liang dynasties, his family members served as administrators in the Hexi Corridor. In 397, the Administrator of Jiankang (建康, in modern Zhangye, Gansu), Duan Ye, with support of the Lushuihu Juqu tribe, broke away from the Later Liang and founded the Northern Liang. Li Gao served as a magistrate under Northern Liang, and in 400, at the recommendation of the local Han elites, he was made the Administrator of Dunhuang.

=== Reign of Li Gao ===
That same year, the Administrator of Jinchang, Tang Yao (唐瑤) rebelled in his commandery and acclaimed Li Gao as his leader, offering him the title of Duke of Liang. Li Gao accepted him, and he declared a general amnesty and changed the era name in his territory. Historiographers refer to his state as Western Liang to distinguish it with the other rival Liang states at the time.

Li Gao&#x27;s state was backed by local Han Chinese gentry clans, and all the cities west of Yumen Commandery submitted to him. In 401, both Jiuquan and Liangning (陇西郡; northwest of present-day Yumen City, Gansu) commanderies also surrendered to him from Northern Liang. To apply more pressure on the Northern Liang, he moved his capital east to Jiuquan in 405 and allied with the Southern Liang. He also nominally submitted to the Later Qin and sent tributes to Northern Wei.

The Western Liang sought to take control of Liang and Qin provinces, but it was relatively weak compared to its neighbours. Li Gao maintained a stable economy within his state by encouraging agriculture and trade with the Western Regions, along with promoting Confucianism through the establishment of new schools. Like the Former Liang before him, Li Gao considered himself a vassal to the Eastern Jin in the south and sent envoys to have his titles recognized by them. However, due to the distance between the two states, it would not be until Liu Yu&#x27;s second northern expedition when the Jin formally recognized Western Liang as a vassal. Western Liang also had to defend themselves against the nomadic Rouran and Tuyuhun.

=== Fall ===
In 417, Li Gao died and was succeeded by his son, Li Xin, who records describe as a cruel ruler who drained the state&#x27;s resource with construction projects. Taking advantage of the situation, the Northern Liang intensified their efforts to conquer Western Liang. In 420, Li Xin was enticed into attacking the Northern Liang capital, Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu), and fell into a trap. He died in battle, and Northern Liang forces soon captured Jiuquan. His brother, Li Xun succeeded him in Dunhuang and continued to hold out, but the city eventually fell and Li Xun committed suicide in 421, putting an end to Western Liang.

Li Gao&#x27;s descendants survived the fall of Western Liang, with the Tang dynasty claiming descent from him through Li Xin&#x27;s son, Li Chong&#x27;er (李重耳), who fled to the Liu Song dynasty in the south before returning north to the Northern Wei. For this reason, the Tang posthumously honoured Li Gao as Emperor Xingsheng and refer to him in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot; by his courtesy name due to naming taboo. Another grandson of Li Gao, Li Bao, was captured by Northern Liang but fled to Yiwu County with his uncle, Tang Qi (唐契), becoming vassals to the Rouran. In 444, Li Bao surrendered and served under Northern Wei, where his son Li Chong became a prominent minister. The famed Tang dynasty poets, Li Bai and Li Shangyin were also both believed to be descendants of Li Gao.

<doc id="448719" wikidata="Q219648" url="?curid=448719" title="Lunda Sul Province">
<text>:&quot;Lunda Sul Province is not to be confused with Luanda Sul, a satellite city of Luanda, the capital of Angola.&quot;

Lunda Sul (&quot;South Lunda&quot;) is a province of Angola. It has an area of 77,637 km2 and a 2014 census population of 537,587. Saurimo is the provincial capital.

==Geography and climate==
The Lunda Sul province is located in the extreme east of Angola, the capital of Saurimo located by road east of the capital Luanda. It is bordered to the north by Lunda Norte Province, to the east by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south by Moxico Province and southwest by Bié Province, and to the west by Malanje Province. The main road from Luanda to Lubumbashi traverses the province from west to east.

The province is dominated by dry savannah land; only in the Kasai River valley are there remnants of tropical rainforest. The Kasai forms the eastern and southern frontier of Lunda Sul and is the main river of the province. The Kwango River is also a major river of the province. The climate of the province is predominantly tropical.

==Municipalities==
The province of Lunda Sul contains four municipalities ():

* Cacolo
* Dala
* Muconda
* Saurimo

==Communes==
The province of Lunda Sul contains the following communes (); sorted by their respective municipalities:

* Cacolo Municipality: – Alto-Chicapa (Alto-Chikapa), Cacolo, Cucumbi (Kukumbi), Xassengue
* Dala Municipality: – Cazage (Cazeje), Dala, Luma Cassai
* Muconda Municipality: – Cassai Sul (Kassai Sul), Chiluage, Muconda, Muriege (Murieje)
* &#x27;Saurimo Municipality: – Mona-Quimbundo (Mona-Kimbundo), Saurimo, Sombo

==Economy and social issues==
Economically the province is dominated by peanut cultivation, which is operated primarily in the Saurimo area. In the south of the province maize production is major contributing factor. Other agricultural products include rice, cassava and cereals. This region is rich with diamonds, manganese and iron which are exploited; Catoca mine in Lunda Sul Province is the fourth largest diamond mine in the world. Due to warfare in the region, at times mining has been disrupted by attacks form the UNITA, especially in 1999-2000.
In spring 1999, UNITA destroyed the bridge on the Kasai River at Biula, affecting transport communications in the region between Lunda Sul and Moxico.

Like in many other areas of Angola, landmines are a serious problem, and it is described as being &quot;severely mined&quot;. As of 1995, some 30 major or strategic bridges and 58 secondary bridges had been destroyed in the province according to Oxfam reports. &quot;Forced return and restrictions to freedom of movement&quot; by people has been noted in the province, and the Huambo and Cuando Cubango provinces.

==Demographics==

The origin of the province&#x27;s population belongs to the ethnic groups of the Lunda and Chokwe people, which are closely connected historically. They are mainly involved in agriculture. There are also many immigrants from other parts of the country, working for the Endiama or as independent diamond miners. The struggle between the Lunda and Chokwe to obtain wealth from the diamond industry has increased tension in the province.

<text>Malanje is the capital city of Malanje Province in Angola, with a population of 455,000 (2014 census), and a municipality, with a population of 506,847 (2014 census). Projected to be the thirteenth fastest growing city on the African continent between 2020 and 2025, with a 5.17% growth. It is located east of Angola&#x27;s capital Luanda. Near it are the spectacular Calandula waterfalls, the rock formations of Pungo Andongo, and the Capanda Dam. The climate is mainly humid, with average temperatures between and rainfall in the rainy season (October to April).

==History==

===Portuguese rule===
Portuguese settlers founded Malanje in the 19th century. The construction of the railway from Luanda to Malanje, in the fertile highlands, started in 1885. The area around Malanje included Portuguese West Africa&#x27;s primary areas dedicated to the production of cotton, the crop that drove its development since the beginning. The town developed in the mid-19th century as an important slave market created in 1852. Situated at an elevation of , the town has a high-altitude tropical climate, ideal to several agricultural productions. The city developed as an important agricultural, manufacturing, trading and services centre. Its productions included cotton, textiles, coffee, fruit and corn. The Cangandala National Park was established by the Portuguese authorities in 1970, having previously been classified as an Integral Natural Reserve in 1963.

===After independence from Portugal===
The withdrawal of the Portuguese in conjunction with Angola&#x27;s independence in 1975, and, later, the Angolan Civil War (1975–2002), severely hampered the production of cotton as well as that of coffee and corn (maize). Malanje was partially destroyed during the civil war, but reconstruction efforts in the years following the end of the conflict have rebuilt the city and its surroundings.

==Climate==

Malanje has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Awbb&quot;).

==Landmarks==
Near the city is the Cangandala National Park, established by the Portuguese authorities on 25 June 1970, it was founded to protect the Giant Sable Antelope which were discovered in 1963. As far as religious buildings are concerned, there is the Evangelical Church at Quêssua and as for funerary constructions, the Tomb of the queen Ana de Sousa Nzinga Mbande and the tomb of José do Telhado, a local Robin Hood. José do Telhado was a Portuguese who was exiled to Portuguese Angola that in colonial days used to steal from rich whites and distribute to poor blacks. Worth visiting is the Forte de Cabatuquila in the city.

==Transportation==
===Airport===
Malanje Airport was built during the colonial era. Currently, there are no flights to the capital Luanda.

===Railway===
The construction of the railway from Luanda to Malanje, in the fertile highlands, started in 1885. After the end of the civil war in 2002, it was expected to be the terminus of a railway from the capital city and port of Luanda once reconstruction was complete.

The Cuije River and Cuanza flow in the vicinity of Cangandala National Park.
Large areas north and southeast of the city of Malanje have been declared protected areas. Of note is the Milando Reserve Park (Reserva Especial do Milando) in the north and the Reserva Natural Integral do Luando at the headwaters of Cuanza.

==Economy==

The province is predominantly agricultural. The most intensively used area in the province of Malanje is the area around the provincial capital, where cotton and sugarcane are the most important industries. The cotton industry was once of vital importance to the national economy, but the years of the Angola Civil War have badly stagnated it. Agriculture in Malanje Province is gradually taking off again, and numerous international investors have been involved, including US$30 million from Brazil to develop the maize and sugarcane industry in the Pungo Andongo area. Malanje Province is also a producer of cassava, sweet potatoes, peanuts, rice, soybeans, sunflowers and various vegetables. The province also has significant reserves of diamonds, limestone, manganese (with 4,682 metric tons exported in 1973), uranium and phosphate.
Tourism has become more important, largely due to its diverse natural attractions, including the Kalandula Falls, the black rock formation of Pungo Andongo, two nature reserves and the Cangandala National Park. Cangandala National Park, the smallest national park in the country, was originally established under Portuguese rule in 1963 to protect the Giant Sable Antelope, before being declared a national park on 25 June 1970.

<text>&quot;&quot; (English: &quot;Chant of Liberty&quot;) is the national anthem of Cape Verde. It was made official in 1996, replacing &quot;Esta É a Nossa Pátria Bem Amada&quot;, which was also the national anthem of Guinea Bissau, a legacy of both countries&#x27; joint independence. The music was composed by Adalberto Higino Tavares Silva (1961–), and the lyrics were written by Amílcar Spencer Lopes (1948–).

The national anthem must be played at the beginning and end of all public events in which the head of state is present and also when national parties and openings and closings of radio and television broadcasts are held.

<text>MTS &quot;Oceanos&quot; was a French-built and Greek-owned cruise ship that sank in 1991 when she suffered uncontrolled flooding. Her captain, Yiannis Avranas, and some of the crew were convicted of negligence for fleeing the ship without helping the passengers, who were subsequently rescued thanks to the efforts of the ship&#x27;s entertainers, who made a mayday transmission, launched lifeboats, and helped South African Marines land on the ship from naval helicopters. All 571 passengers and crew survived.

Epirotiki Lines had lost two other ships within the three years preceding the sinking: the company&#x27;s flagship &quot;Pegasus&quot; only two months before, and MV &quot;Jupiter&quot;, three years before.

==History==
&quot;Oceanos&quot; was launched in July 1952 by Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde in Bordeaux, France as &quot;Jean Laborde&quot;, the last of four sister ships built for Messageries Maritimes. The ships were used on the Marseilles – Madagascar – Mauritius service. &quot;Jean Laborde&quot; went through many different owners and name changes (&quot;Jean Laborde&quot;, &quot;Mykinai&quot;, &quot;Ancona&quot;, &quot;Eastern Princess&quot;) in the succeeding decades. In 1976, she was acquired by Epirotiki Lines of Greece and registered under the name of &quot;Oceanos&quot;.

&quot;Oceanos&quot; was briefly featured in the 1985 film &quot;Sky High&quot; and with another Epirotiki ship, &quot;Apollon XI&quot;, in the 1986 film &quot;Hardbodies 2&quot;.

===Final voyage===

Under charter by TFC Tours, &quot;Oceanos&quot; initially delayed by a bomb threat set out from East London, South Africa on 3 August 1991, and headed for Durban. Captain Yiannis Avranas (born 1940) had been an officer for twenty years and a seaman for thirty. &quot;Oceanos&quot; headed into 40-knot winds and swells. Usually, there would have been a &quot;sail-away&quot; party on deck. However, rough seas caused the party to be held inside in the Four Seasons lounge; most passengers chose to stay in their cabins.

While trying to make up lost time, &quot;Oceanos&quot; encountered rough seas. The storm worsened as the evening progressed and when the first sitting of dinner was served, the waiters could hardly carry the trays of food without dropping something.

====Flooding====
Earlier repairs to the waste disposal system had not been completed, which meant that a vital ventilation pipe which ran through the watertight aft bulkhead and the non-return valves were not replaced. It is believed that after a series of freak waves slammed against the ship, the pipe&#x27;s shell plating burst open and began filling the compartment with seawater. At about 9:30p.m., a muffled explosion was heard and &quot;Oceanos&quot; lost power. The ship started taking on water, rapidly flooding the engine room.

Once the engines stopped, the ship had rolled over to the point that in the lounge, which is where the passengers had gathered, crockery and cutlery began sliding off the tables and potted plants fell over.

No alarm or announcement had been given that the ship was in trouble; with other entertainers working on the cruise, Moss Hills, a musician from Zimbabwe and former member of Four Jacks and a Jill who had been performing with his wife Tracy in the lounge, explored below decks, discovered that &quot;Oceanos&quot; appeared to be sinking, and were informed by the cruise director, Lorraine Betts, that the captain had given the order to abandon ship and some crew had already left in a lifeboat. They began launching the remaining lifeboats, with up to 90 people in each, but were unable to start their engines. When the ship&#x27;s worsening list to starboard made it unsafe to continue, Hills and several passengers went to the bridge to look for the crew, but found it unmanned. They used the radio phone to broadcast a mayday distress call until Hills received a response.

By the next morning rescuers found &quot;Oceanos&quot; adrift just off Coffee Bay, on the Wild Coast.

====Rescue efforts====
Two small ships in the vicinity were first on the scene, and provided the ship&#x27;s coordinates to the South African authorities. Rescue helicopters began arriving three hours later, and winched passengers and remaining crew to safety, with Hills continuing in charge of the orderly evacuation. Thirteen of the sixteen helicopters were South African Air Force Pumas, nine of which hoisted 225 passengers off the deck. They were assisted by the lifeboats of the Dutch cargo ship &quot;Nedlloyd Mauritius&quot;, which had responded to the distress call. An inflatable had to be launched to rescue some passengers who panicked and jumped into the water.

&quot;Oceanos&quot; rolled onto her starboard side and sank bow first approximately 45 minutes after the last person was airlifted from the deck, with her bow striking the seabed 308 ft below the surface, bringing the stern to a vertical position. The ship then toppled over towards her starboard side and disappeared beneath the waves. The final minutes of her sinking were captured on video and broadcast by ABC News. All 571 people on board were saved. Entertainment manager Robin Boltman was credited with gathering the passengers in the lounge and playing music to calm them. Among the entertainers onboard was the South African cabaret performer, Alvon Collison, who later reported that he had begun singing an impromptu repertoire as the ship was sinking, in an effort to keep the passengers&#x27; spirits up. In his characteristic style, he managed to weave a comical moment into his narrative of the tumultuous events, telling reporters that he had started singing &quot;Bye Bye Miss American Pie&quot;, when he suddenly realised that the next line was going to be &quot;This&#x27;ll be the day that I die&quot; and quickly switched to another song.

Hills later said that searching for Captain Avranas, he had discovered him smoking on the fantail and he said &quot;I think he was in deep, deep shock.&quot; Hills reportedly rescued Avranas&#x27; dog and released his canary. A South African Navy Diver testified that the captain had insisted on being taken ashore by the first helicopter. Boltman told a newspaper: &quot;Later in the morning, Captain Avarnasi (&quot;sic&quot;) even contacted me from shore to ask how things were going.&quot;

===Aftermath===
Captain Avranas received extensive media coverage as an example of unprofessional behaviour whilst in command. He stated that he left the ship first to arrange for a rescue effort, and then supervised the rescue from a helicopter because &quot;the batteries on the crew&#x27;s walkie-talkies had died, meaning that he had no communications with his crew or with other rescue craft&quot;. He was quoted soon after the sinking as saying, &quot;When I order abandon the ship, it doesn&#x27;t matter what time I leave. Abandon is for everybody. If some people like to stay, they can stay.&quot; In 1992, he and five other officers were convicted of negligence by a Greek board of inquiry for fleeing the ship without helping the passengers.

&quot;Dateline NBC&quot; aired a documentary of the incident on 23 May 2010. The sinking is the subject of a song called &quot;Oceanos&quot; by Celtic rock band Coast. It was also discussed in an episode of &quot;Nova&quot; on 18 April 2012, entitled, &quot;Why Ships Sink&quot;, which focused mainly on the &quot;Costa Concordia&quot; accident (whose commanding officer also fled while passengers were still aboard). Hills was interviewed in the special, and related that some years later he had been on board when the MS &quot;Achille Lauro&quot; of Star Lauro sank. The rescue featured in episode 4 of &quot;Shockwave&quot;, first aired 21 December 2007. The NPR radio show and podcast &quot;Snap Judgment&quot; featured an account of the sinking by Moss Hills. The show &quot;Extreme Weather: The Survivors&quot; featured a segment on the sinking. In 2022, Hills – who later became a cruise director – was interviewed by Jane Garvey for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s series &quot;Life Changing&quot;.

==Wreck==
The &quot;Oceanos&quot; wreck lies at a depth of between and , about offshore. Divers have visited her, but strong currents make the dive difficult. Photographs taken in 2002 show that the bridge section has collapsed.

== In popular culture ==
The MTS &quot;Oceanos&quot; and another Epirotiki ship, the &quot;Apollon XI&quot;, were featured in the 1986 film &quot;Hardbodies 2&quot;. The podcast “Snap Judgement” aired the story on season 15, episode 35.

<text>Elf is a 2003 American Christmas comedy film directed by Jon Favreau and written by David Berenbaum. It stars Will Ferrell as Buddy the Elf, a human raised by Santa&#x27;s elves, who learns about his origins and heads to New York City to meet his biological father. James Caan, Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner and Bob Newhart appear in supporting roles.

&quot;Elf&quot; was released in the United States on November 7, 2003, by New Line Cinema. It became a major critical and commercial success, grossing $220 million worldwide against a $33 million budget. Ferrell&#x27;s performance as Buddy, in particular, was praised by critics. The film inspired the 2010 Broadway musical &quot;Elf: The Musical&quot; and NBC&#x27;s 2014 stop motion animated television special &quot;&quot;. It has been hailed by many as a modern classic and is often listed as one of the best Christmas films of all time.

==Plot==

One Christmas Eve, a baby from an orphanage crawls into Santa Claus&#x27;s sack when he sees a teddy bear and is unwittingly taken back to the North Pole. When the infant is discovered at Santa&#x27;s workshop, the elves name him Buddy, after his diaper&#x27;s brand label, and Papa Elf adopts him. Growing up, Buddy believes that he is an elf, but discovers in adulthood that he is a human. Papa Elf explains to Buddy that his birth parents are Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, the latter putting him up for adoption before her death. Walter now works as a children&#x27;s book publisher at the Empire State Building in New York City, unaware of Buddy&#x27;s existence.

Buddy travels to New York and finds Walter at his workplace, but Walter mistakes him for a Christmas-gram messenger and has him ejected. Buddy visits a Gimbels department store and becomes infatuated with a disillusioned employee named Jovie. Hearing that Santa will visit the store the following day, Buddy redecorates the store overnight. However, after realizing that the store&#x27;s Santa is simply a man in costume, Buddy exposes him and causes a brawl that the manager breaks up.

Walter reluctantly bails out Buddy from jail and takes him for a DNA test, which confirms that he is his son. The doctor suggests to Walter that he take Buddy home to meet his stepmother Emily and half-brother Michael. Walter and Michael are unnerved by Buddy&#x27;s behavior, but Emily insists that they take care of him until he &quot;recovers&quot;. Michael grows closer to Buddy after they defeat a gang of bullies in a snowball fight and helps Buddy to ask out Jovie on a date.

Meanwhile, Walter&#x27;s publishing company is struggling after the failure of its latest book. Walter&#x27;s boss, Fulton Greenway, expects him to have a new book ready by Christmas Eve. Walter and his associates secure a meeting with ghostwriter Miles Finch, but Buddy interrupts the meeting and unintentionally insults Finch, mistaking him for an elf because of his dwarfism. Finch attacks Buddy and leaves the meeting, causing Walter to furiously disown Buddy. Heartbroken, Buddy writes an apology on an Etch A Sketch and leaves the Hobbses&#x27; apartment.

After finding the note, Michael rushes to Walter with news of Buddy&#x27;s departure. Realizing his mistake, Walter quits his job and leaves with Michael to find Buddy. Meanwhile, Buddy sees Santa&#x27;s sleigh crash in Central Park, drawing a large crowd. Santa explains that the sleigh has lost its engine, which is essential for flight due to a shortage of Christmas spirit.

Buddy finds the engine and reunites with Walter and Michael. Walter apologizes to Buddy for his outburst and finally accepts him as his son. After Buddy takes them to meet Santa, Michael takes Santa&#x27;s list and reads it in front of news cameras gathered outside the park. Buddy tries to reattach the engine as Central Park Rangers pursue the sleigh. Jovie leads a reluctant Walter, the crowd and those watching on television in a rendition of &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; to Town&quot;, generating enough Christmas spirit to power the sleigh without the engine.

By next Christmas, Walter and Buddy have started their own independent publishing company, with their first bestseller being a children&#x27;s book based on Buddy&#x27;s adventures. Buddy has also married Jovie and brings their infant daughter Susie to visit Papa Elf.

==Cast==

Faizon Love portrays Wanda, the manager of Gimbels and Jovie&#x27;s boss. Peter Dinklage portrays short-statured children&#x27;s book author Miles Finch. Amy Sedaris plays Walter&#x27;s secretary Deb. Michael Lerner portrays Fulton Greenway, the head of Greenway Press who is Walter&#x27;s controlling and uncaring boss. Andy Richter and Kyle Gass play Walter&#x27;s colleagues Morris and Eugene, respectively.

Artie Lange plays the department store Santa with whom Buddy gets into a fight. Will Ferrell&#x27;s brother Patrick appears with Patrick McCartney as a pair of Empire State Building security guards. Mark Acheson portrays the mailroom worker who shares his liquor with Buddy. Favreau makes a cameo appearance as Ben, Walter&#x27;s family doctor who does a DNA test on Buddy. Lydia Lawson-Baird portrays Carolyn Reynolds, a little girl who Buddy meets in the waiting room who wants a &quot;Suzy Talks-A-Lot&quot; for Christmas. Claire Lautier plays NY1 reporter Charlotte Denon covering the crash in Central Park, and Matt Walsh appears alongside her as himself.

At the North Pole, David Paul Grove portrays the Christmas elf Pom Pom, on whom Buddy faints, Michael Roberds portrays a Christmas elf cobbler, and Richard Side plays a Christmas elf teacher. Producer Peter Billingsley is uncredited as head Christmas elf Ming Ming.

Additionally, Leon Redbone voices Leon the Snowman, Ray Harryhausen voices a Polar bear cub, and Favreau is uncredited as the voice of Baby Walrus, Mr. Narwhal and the Arctic Puffin. Also uncredited are Maurice LaMarche for providing Buddy&#x27;s extended belch, and Dallas McKennon, who provides the voice of the jack-in-the-boxes via archive audio of the hyena he voiced from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
David Berenbaum initially wrote the script in 1993, with Chris Farley and Jim Carrey being early candidates to play Buddy. Berenbaum&#x27;s screenplay underwent uncredited rewrites by Scot Armstrong, Chris Henchy and the writing team of Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. Garry Shandling was offered the role of Walter Hobbs but declined. Wanda Sykes was originally cast as the Gimbels manager Wanda but dropped out. Terry Zwigoff was asked to direct the film, but he turned it down in favor of &quot;Bad Santa&quot; (2003).

According to Jon Favreau, the script was initially &quot;much darker&quot; and did not interest him, although he was interested in working with Ferrell&#x27;s first post-&quot;SNL&quot; movie. Asked to rewrite it, a turning point came when he realized that he could make Buddy&#x27;s world an homage to the Rankin/Bass Christmas specials. This allowed him to conceive of a movie that could be rated PG, as opposed to the original script, which he guessed would have been rated PG-13.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on December 9, 2002, and wrapped on March 7, 2003. Filming took place in New York City, as well as in Vancouver and at Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam, British Columbia.

The film makes heavy use of forced perspective to exaggerate the size of Buddy compared to all the other elves. Stop motion animation was employed for certain sequences. CGI usage was kept to a minimum due to Favreau&#x27;s own preference, something for which he later noted that he &quot;had to fight very hard&quot;.

Will Ferrell said in interviews that he suffered ill effects after eating too much sugar for the film.

Zooey Deschanel&#x27;s singing was not in the original script, and Favreau added it when he learned that she was a singer. Ferrell improvised several moments in the film, including the scene in which Buddy starts singing in the middle of Santaland at Gimbels, and the scene in which Buddy screams out &quot;Santa!&quot; when Gimbels&#x27; manager, Wanda, announces that Santa is coming to the store.

===Post-production===
Apart from snow, most of the computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the film was created by Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios. Buddy&#x27;s belch after drinking a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola was dubbed by voice actor Maurice LaMarche.

==Music==
The soundtrack was released on New Line Records in November 2003 in the United States, and in October 2005 in the United Kingdom, including its signature song &quot;Baby, It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot; by Deschanel and Leon Redbone, which was released as a single. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in April 2011. Having sold 695,000 copies in the United States, it is the second-highest-selling soundtrack album for a Christmas-themed film since Nielsen SoundScan started tracking music sales in 1991, behind only &quot;The Polar Express&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Elf&quot; holds an approval rating of , based on 203 reviews, and an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A movie full of Yuletide cheer, &quot;Elf&quot; is a spirited, good-natured family comedy, and it benefits greatly from Will Ferrell&#x27;s funny and charming performance as one of Santa&#x27;s biggest helpers.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it three stars out of four, calling it &quot;one of those rare Christmas comedies that has a heart, a brain, and a wicked sense of humor, and it charms the socks right off the mantelpiece&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers gave the film two stars out of four, saying, &quot;Ferrell makes the damn thing work. Even though he can&#x27;t get naked or use naughty words, there&#x27;s a devil of comedy in Ferrell, and he lets it out to play. Director Jon Favreau has the good sense to just stand out of his way.&quot;

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;While the words &#x27;instant holiday classic&#x27; might be pushing it, Elf is at the very least a breezily entertaining, perfectly cast family treat.&quot;

A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave the film a positive review, saying, &quot;&quot;Elf&quot; is a charming, silly family Christmas movie more likely to spread real joy than migraine, indigestion and sugar shock. The movie succeeds because it at once restrains its sticky, gooey good cheer and wildly overdoes it.&quot;

Anna Smith of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine gave the film a three stars out of five, and said, &quot;Ferrell&#x27;s man-child invites sympathy and sniggers, making this amusing despite some flimsy plotting. Sight gags and a Santa-centered story should keep the kids happy too.&quot;

&quot;Plugged In&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;The elf-reared Buddy has a heart as big as the arctic north. Does his movie match it?&quot;

<doc id="448739" wikidata="Q107140" url="?curid=448739" title="National emblem of Cape Verde">
<text>The [[national emblem]] of [[Cape Verde]] contains a circle within which is written the name of the nation in Portuguese. Within the circle are a torch and triangle, symbols of freedom and national unity. At the top of the shield is a plumbob, a symbol of righteousness; three chain links are at the bottom. This emblem replaces the earlier variant with the seashell that had been in use since independence. The current emblem was adopted in 1999.

==Background and historical arms==
On 8 May 1935, Portugal introduced a new coat of arms for its colonies, including Cape Verde, São Tomé and Principe, and Guinea-Bissau (then Portuguese Guinea). The 1935 arms are described as follows: &quot;All arms were of the same model: divided vertically in such a way that two sub-shields are formed. The dexter was white with five small blue shields each bearing five white discs (i.e. the “quinas cross” representing the motherland). The sinister represented the colony. In the base green and white waves to indicate the overseas location. To complete the badge, the arms were set upon a golden armillary sphere with a golden mural crown.&quot; On July 11, 1951, a slightly revised version was introduced, which was used until July 5, 1975.

The replacement flag following independence in 1975, in use from then until 1992, used colours more typical of African nations, with red, green and yellow, almost identical to the flag of Guinea-Bissau. On the left in the red portion of the flag was the coat of arms, in use from July 5, 1975 until September 22, 1992 in its own right. It featured a large black star, surrounded by a saffron-yellow and green maize wreath and a scallop shell in the centre, also of a saffron/amber colour. The independent coat of arms, not used on the flag, featured the same saffron-yellow and green maize wreath and a scallop shell in the centre at the bottom, but the star was smaller and complicated with several other features, including a flag poll and something resembling a book. The current national emblem of Cape Verde was adopted in 1992 at the same time as the national flag, 17 years after the island nation became independent.

===Gallery===
==Symbolism==
The circle of the current emblem is ringed with ten stars, that represent the islands of Cape Verde, and is similar to the symbolism on the flag of Cape Verde. The plumbob symbolizes righteousness and uprightness which constitute the &quot;key vault&quot; of Cape Verdean constitution. The equilateral triangle symbolizes unity, equality and people&#x27;s civil rights recognized by the democratic system. The torch symbolizes freedom gained after many years of struggle. The sea symbolizes nostalgia. The palms symbolize victory won in the struggle for national independence, and the stars represent the ten islands that form the archipelago of Cape Verde.

<doc id="448740" wikidata="Q512615" url="?curid=448740" title="HMS Erebus (1826)">
<text>HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; was a constructed by the Royal Navy in Pembroke dockyard, Wales, in 1826. The vessel was the second in the Royal Navy named after Erebus, the personification of darkness in Greek mythology.

The 372-ton ship was armed with two mortars – one and one – and 10 guns. The ship took part in the Ross expedition of 1839–1843, and was abandoned in 1848 during the third Franklin expedition. The sunken wreck was discovered by the Canadian Victoria Strait expedition in September 2014.

== Ross expedition ==
After two years&#x27; service in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;Erebus&quot; was refitted as an exploration vessel for Antarctic service, and on 21 November 1840 – captained by James Clark Ross – she departed from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) for Antarctica in company with HMS &quot;Terror&quot;. In January 1841, the crews of both ships landed on Victoria Land, and proceeded to name areas of the landscape after British politicians, scientists, and acquaintances. Mount Erebus, on Ross Island, was named after one ship and Mount Terror after the other.

The crew then discovered the Ross Ice Shelf, which they were unable to penetrate, and followed it eastward until the lateness of the season compelled them to return to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The following season, 1842, Ross continued to survey the &quot;Great Ice Barrier&quot;, as it was called, continuing to follow it eastward. Both ships returned to the Falkland Islands before returning to the Antarctic in the 1842–1843 season. They conducted studies in magnetism, and returned with oceanographic data and collections of botanical and ornithological specimens. The plants were described in the resulting &quot;The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M. Discovery Ships Erebus and Terror in the years 1839–1843, under the Command of Captain Sir James Clark Ross&quot;.

Birds collected on the first expedition were described and illustrated by George Robert Gray and Richard Bowdler Sharpe in &quot;The Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Erebus &amp; HMS Terror. Birds of New Zealand&quot;, 1875. The revised edition of Gray (1846) (1875). The future botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, then aged 23, was assistant-surgeon to Robert McCormick.

== Franklin expedition ==


On May 19, 1845, HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS left Greenhithe, England on a voyage of exploration to the Canadian Arctic, under Sir John Franklin. Both ships were outfitted with steam engines from the London and Greenwich Railway steam locomotives. That of &quot;Erebus&quot; was rated at and could propel the ship at . The ships carried 12 days&#x27; supply of coal. The ships had iron plating added to their hulls.

Sir John Franklin sailed in &quot;Erebus&quot;, in overall command of the expedition, and &quot;Terror&quot; was again commanded by Francis Crozier. The expedition was ordered to gather magnetic data in the Canadian Arctic and to complete a crossing of the Northwest Passage, which had already been partly charted from both the east and west but had never been entirely navigated.

The ships were last seen by Europeans entering Baffin Bay in August 1845, by two whaling vessels. The disappearance of the Franklin expedition set off a massive search effort in the Arctic. The broad circumstances of the expedition&#x27;s fate were first revealed when Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company doctor John Rae collected artefacts and testimony from local Inuit in 1853. Later expeditions up to 1866 confirmed these reports.
Both ships had become icebound and had been abandoned by their crews, totaling about 130 men, all of whom died from a variety of causes, including hypothermia, scurvy and starvation while trying to trek overland to the south. Subsequent expeditions until the late 1980s, and autopsies of crew members, also revealed that &quot;Erebus&quot; and &quot;Terror&quot;″s shoddily canned rations may have been tainted by both lead and botulism. Oral reports by local Inuit that some of the crew members resorted to cannibalism were at least somewhat supported by forensic evidence of cut marks on the skeletal remains of crew members found on King William Island during the late 20th century.

In April 1851, the British transport ship &quot;Renovation&quot; spotted two ships on a large ice floe off the coast of Newfoundland. The identities of the ships were not confirmed. It was suggested over the years that these might have been &quot;Erebus&quot; and &quot;Terror&quot;, though it is now certain they could not have been and were most likely abandoned whaling ships.

== Wreckage discovery ==
On the 15 August 2008, Parks Canada, an agency of the Government of Canada, announced a Can$ 75,000 six-week search deploying the icebreaker , with the goals of finding the ships and reinforcing Canada&#x27;s claims regarding sovereignty over large portions of the Arctic. The search was headed by underwater archeologist Robert Grenier, of Parks Canada, and local historian Louie Kamookak, who had collected Inuit oral histories related to the wreck, as well as working with the written records. Kamookak, who died in 2018 at the age of 58, was made an officer of the Order of Canada and a member of the Order of Nunavut for his work.

The wreckage of one of Franklin&#x27;s ships was found on 2 September 2014 by a Parks Canada team led by Ryan Harris and Marc-André Bernier. On 1 October 2014, it was announced that the remains were those of &quot;Erebus&quot;. Recovery of the ship&#x27;s bell was announced on 6 November 2014. On 4 March 2015, it was announced that a diving expedition on &quot;Erebus&quot;, by Parks Canada and Royal Canadian Navy divers, would begin in April.

Although the exact location was not released, Nancy Anilniliak, the Field Unit Superintendent of the Nunavut Field Unit, has restricted access to a square area in Wilmot and Crampton Bay, to the west of the Adelaide Peninsula. The area runs from Point A () to Point B () to Point C () to Point D ().

On 12 September 2016, it was announced that the wreck of HMS &quot;Terror&quot; had been found submerged in Terror Bay, off the south-west coast of King William Island. The wrecks are designated a National Historic Site of Canada with the precise location of the designation in abeyance. On 23 October 2017, British Defence Minister Sir Michael Fallon announced that the United Kingdom would transfer the ownership of both ships to Canada, retaining only a few relics and any gold, along with the right to repatriate any human remains.

In September 2018, Parks Canada announced that &quot;Erebus&quot;″ condition had deteriorated significantly, with a section of the upper deck detaching from the ship, flipping over, and moving towards the stern. Parks Canada attributed the deterioration to &quot;an upwards buoyant force acting on the decking combined with storm swell in relatively shallow water&quot;. It was then confirmed that the United Kingdom will own the first 65 artifacts brought up from &quot;Erebus&quot; while the wrecks of both ships and other artifacts will be owned by Canada and the Inuit. Taking advantage of &quot;sublime&quot; weather conditions in the summer of 2019, Parks Canada were able to recover a number of artifacts from &quot;Erebus&quot;, namely personal items belonging to members of the crew, which were unveiled at Parks Canada&#x27;s conservation lab in Ottawa in February 2020. The planned exploration of the wreck sites in 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with access to the wrecks restricted to the Inuit Guardians keeping watch on the sites and for those with harvesting rights in the surrounding waters. Underwater archaeology team leader Marc-Andre Bernier remarked that Parks Canada was &quot;concerned about &quot;Erebus&quot;&quot;, given the wreck&#x27;s shallower depths and the earlier reports of damage. Parks Canada&#x27;s Underwater Archaeology Team returned to the wrecks in May 2022, after a two-year postponement caused by the pandemic; particular attention would be paid to any further damage to &quot;Erebus&quot;, due to her shallower depths. Recovered from &quot;Erebus&quot; during the 2022 season were 275 items, most prominently a leather-bound folio discovered in the steward&#x27;s pantry. The Parks Canada team has expressed the hope that deciphering its contents, whatever they might be, may bode well for future discoveries of written materials from both ships.

== Public access ==

On 5 September 2019, passengers of Adventure Canada on were the first members of the public to visit the site of the wreck of the &quot;Erebus&quot;. The wreck site is within the Wrecks of HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; and HMS &quot;Terror&quot; National Historic Site and is managed jointly by Parks Canada and local Inui, and public access to the site is not usually allowed. The visit by Adventure Canada passengers was a trial by Parks Canada in creating a visitor experience for the wreck site.

<doc id="448747" wikidata="Q221914" url="?curid=448747" title="Moçâmedes">
<text>Moçâmedes is a city in southwestern Angola, and the capital of Namibe Province. The city&#x27;s current population is 255,000 (2014 census). Founded in 1840 by the Portuguese colonial administration, the city was named Namibe between 1985 and 2016. Moçâmedes has a cool dry climate and desert vegetation, because it is near the Namib Desert.

== History ==
The area was first explored by the Portuguese in 1785 and claimed for Portugal by Luís Cândido Cordeiro Pinheiro Furtado, who had been sent there in the frigate &quot;Loanda&quot; by the then governor-general of Angola, Baron Moçâmedes (Portuguese: &quot;Barão de Mossâmedes&quot;), who also sent an overland expedition headed by Gregório José Mendes to rendezvous with Furtado. They renamed the bay Moçâmedes in honour of the baron.

In 1839 the then governor-general of Angola, Admiral Noronha, sent a fresh expedition to subdue the local chiefs and make them vassals of Portugal.

Moçâmedes was officially founded in 1840 by the Portuguese colonial administration on a bay that the Portuguese originally called &quot;Angra do Negro&quot; by order of Portuguese prime minister, the Count of Bonfim, who was also head of the Colonial Department.

In 1840 a factory was established and in July of the same year a fort was built at Ponta Negra. The area was colonized mainly by Portuguese settlers from Madeira and Brazil; in the 1850s the Portuguese government also gave sea passage and financial assistance to a large number of German colonists.

The village grew as a fishing port and by the 1960s it had 143 fishing boats and several fish processing factories. The port soon ranked alongside other important fishing ports such as Luanda, Benguela and Lobito.

About 200 km from the city of Moçâmedes the Portuguese authorities founded the Iona National Park, Angola&#x27;s oldest and largest national park, proclaimed as a reserve in 1937 and upgraded to a national park covering 15,150 km2 in 1964.

==Climate==
Moçâmedes has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). Despite being well north of the Tropic of Capricorn on the Atlantic Coast, the climate is subtropical due to the cooling effect of the northward-flowing Benguela Current causing July and August to be below 18 °C.
==Economy==

During 1966-67 a major iron ore terminal was built at Saco, the bay 12 km north of Moçâmedes, to serve the iron ore mine inland at Cassinga. Construction of the mine installations and a 300 km railway were commissioned to Krupp of Germany and the modern harbour terminal to SETH, a Portuguese company owned by Højgaard &amp; Schultz of Denmark.

Within one year the first 250,000 ton ore carrier docked and loaded with ore in 1967.

==Culture==
===Religion===
The city&#x27;s Sé Catedral de São Pedro is the cathedral episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Namibe, which was established in 2009 on territory split from its Metropolitan&#x27;s Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lubango, to which it is a suffragan diocese.

===Sports===
In 2013, Moçâmedes, then called Namibe, and the national capital Luanda jointly hosted the 2013 FIRS Men&#x27;s Roller Hockey World Cup, the first time that a World Cup of roller hockey was held in Africa.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Moçâmedes is the terminus of the Moçâmedes Railway. This line was originally 600mm gauge but was converted to 1067mm gauge in the 1950s.

<text>Namibe Province is a province of Angola. Under Portuguese rule it was the Moçâmedes District. It has an area of 57,091 km2 and had a 2014 census population of 495,326. The port and city of Moçâmedes is the capital of the province with a population of 250,000 in 2014. Iona National Park lies within the province.

==History==
From its foundation by the Portuguese in 1840 and until 1985, the area was known as Moçâmedes (also spelled &quot;Mossâmedes&quot;). The current name of the province is derived from the Namib Desert, lying predominantly in Namibia; the northernmost part, however, extended into the province of Namibe.
Extensive flooding in the province occurred on April 5, 2001, with the Bero and Giraul River severely affecting roads and people in Namibe, Huila and Benguela provinces. A reported 20 people in Namibe Province lost their lives during the flood.

==Geography and wildlife==

Namibe Province covers an area of 57,091 km2, much of which is desert. The capital of the province is the city of Moçâmedes, with the second city being Tômbua or Tómbwa (formerly Porto Alexandre). In the Namib Desert can be seen the rare &quot;Welwitschia mirabilis&quot;, &quot;a strange plant with a giant root&quot;, and also the Iona National Park. Lake Arco, a fresh-water oasis, is a stunning sight in the middle of the desert. Near the coast of the Bentiaba desert and in Iona National Park, Late Cretaceous fossils of sharks, turtles, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs and sauropods have been discovered.

== Municipalities ==
The province of Namibe consists of five municipalities ():

* Bibala
* Camacuio
* Moçâmedes (Namibe until 2016)

<text>The Territory of Nevada (N.T.) was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 2, 1861, until October 31, 1864, when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Nevada.

Prior to the creation of the Nevada Territory, the area was part of western Utah Territory and was known as Washoe, after the native Washoe people. The separation of the territory from Utah was important to the federal government because of its political leanings, while the population itself was keen to be separated because of animosity (and sometimes violence) between non-Mormons in Nevada and Mormons from the rest of the Utah Territory.

==History==
The eastern boundary of Nevada Territory had been defined as the 39th meridian west from Washington, but when gold discoveries were made to the east the Nevada territorial delegation to Congress requested the boundary be moved east to the 38th meridian, which Congress granted in 1862. The border was shifted further east, to the 37th meridian, in 1866, in part due to the discovery of more gold deposits. These eastward shifts took land away from Utah Territory. The southern border of Nevada Territory had been defined as the 37th parallel, but in 1866 Nevada asked Congress to move the border south to the Colorado River. Congress granted the request in 1867, giving Nevada all of the western end of Arizona Territory. Arizona strongly protested, but found little sympathy in Congress due in part to Arizona having aligned with the Confederacy during the Civil War.

The exact location of the due north-south California–Nevada border, between Lake Tahoe and the intersection with the southern boundary of Oregon at the 42nd parallel, was contentious and was surveyed and re-surveyed well into the 20th century.

Congress transferred some of the lands west of the Colorado River including Pah-Ute County, Arizona Territory to the State of Nevada on May 5, 1866. Part of this southern tip of Nevada was established as Clark County in 1909 and contains the city of Las Vegas.

The territorial capital was moved from the provisional capital of Genoa to Carson City. James Warren Nye succeeded Isaac Roop, the first provisional territorial governor, and became the only territorial governor. The secretary of the territory was Orion Clemens (older brother of Samuel Clemens, also known as Mark Twain), who more or less served as governor in Nye&#x27;s constant absence.

<text>HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; was a First World War monitor launched on 19 June 1916 and which served in both world wars. She and her sister ship are known as the . They were named after the two bomb vessels sent to investigate the Northwest Passage as part of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition (1845–1848), in which all 129 members eventually perished.

Monitors were designed as stable gun platforms with a shallow draught to allow operations close inshore in support of land operations, and were not intended to contest naval battles. &quot;Erebus&quot; was equipped with two /42 guns in a single forward turret mounted on a tall barbette to extend the range of fire to .

The &quot;Erebus&quot; class were designed to outrange German heavy shore batteries and they were also fitted with highly effective anti-torpedo bulges on each side of the hull.

==Background==
During the First World War, the Royal Navy developed several classes of ships which were designed to give close support to troops ashore through the use of naval bombardment. Termed monitors, they owed little to the monitors of the 19th century, though they shared the characteristics of poor seaworthiness, shallow draught and heavy armament in turrets. The size of the various monitor classes of the Royal Navy and their armaments varied greatly. The was the United Kingdom&#x27;s first attempt at a monitor carrying guns. Following construction of the first two of the &quot;Marshall Ney&quot;-class, another four were ordered in May 1915, with the Harland and Wolff shipyard at Govan receiving a contract to construct two hulls, which were given yard numbers 492 and 493. However, all four were cancelled in June when it was realised that there were insufficient gun turrets to complete both the battleship, , and the monitors before 1917.

By August 1915, , the first of her class, had revealed a very poor performance in her sea trials. The monitor&#x27;s engines would not start reliably and were prone to stalling, making it impossible for the ship to achieve even the minimum standard for the trial of four hours of continuous sailing at full power. The vessel was also difficult to steer. Disappointed by the failure, the Admiralty began the design of a replacement class on 6 September, which incorporated lessons learned from all of the previous classes of monitor commissioned during the war. Some of the main modifications were an increase in the power supply to guarantee a speed of and a change to the angles and lines of the hull to improve steering. Another significant change was to raise the top of the anti-torpedo bulge above the waterline and reduce its width; both changes would improve the stability and maneuverability of the ship at sea. The bulge was fitted along each side of the ship and was intended to absorb the impact of any explosions. To maintain protection while reducing the bulge&#x27;s width, its inner compartment was made water tight and filled with 70 steel tubes, rather than leaving the inner compartment open to the sea as in previous designs.

==Design and construction==
The new design, which would later be named the &quot;Erebus&quot;-class, was for a vessel long, wide with a draught of . It would have loaded displacement, with a maximum operational speed of produced by triple-expansion steam engines with two shafts, and a crew of 204. Power would be provided by four Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers, which would generate a combined . The monitors would have an operational range of at a speed of 12knots.

The ships would be armoured to a similar standard to the , which were launched in April 1915. Deck armour would range from on the forecastle, through on the upper deck and over the magazine and belt. With the main 15 in guns being originally intended for use on a battleship, the armour for the turret was substantially thicker than elsewhere in the design; with on the front, on the other sides and on the roof. The main gun&#x27;s barbette would be protected by of armour. The conning tower was protected by of armour on the sides and on the roof. Each anti-torpedo bulge was wide with an outer air-filled compartment wide and an inner compartment wide containing the steel tubes.

Orders for two vessels of the new design were placed with Harland and Wolff on 29 September with reinstated yard numbers 492 and 493, which were renamed respectively &quot;Erebus&quot; and on 13 October. &quot;Erebus&quot; was laid down at Harland and Wolff&#x27;s shipyard in Govan on 12 October 1915 and launched on 19 June 1916.

The ship&#x27;s main armament consisted of two BL 15in Mk I naval guns in a single forward turret. &quot;Erebus&#x27;s&quot; turret was originally a spare for the battlecruiser , which was prepared in case the new BL 18in Mk I naval guns intended for the larger vessel were ineffective. Learning from the earlier experience with &quot;Ney&quot;, the turrets were adjusted to increase elevation to 30 degrees, which would add greater firing range.

&quot;Erebus&quot; conducted sea trials on 1 September, during which the ship was faster than her sister at compared to for &quot;Terror&quot;. However, under service conditions the maximum speed that could be achieved for both vessels was with a clean hull or with a fouled hull. &quot;Erebus&quot; was completed and commissioned on 2 September.

==Service history==
===First World War===
During the First World War, &quot;Erebus&quot; bombarded German naval forces based at the Belgian ports of Ostend and Zeebrugge.

On 28 October 1917, she was damaged by a remote controlled German FL-boat, and suffered the loss of of anti-torpedo bulge.

===Inter-war period===
In 1919, &quot;Erebus&quot; took part in the British Invasion of Russia providing gunfire support in the White Sea and in the Baltic Sea.

In 1921, she took part in gunnery trials against the surrendered German battleship . She then served as a gunnery training ship between the two world wars. After a refit completed in August 1939, she was earmarked as guardship at Cape Town, but due to the outbreak of World War II this did not occur.

===Second World War===
In the early war years, &quot;Erebus&quot; served with the Eastern Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet, where she was used to run supplies to besieged Tobruk and bombard enemy concentrations. She was present at Trincomalee during the Japanese attack on the harbour there, receiving a near-miss hit from Japanese aircraft, suffering casualties. In 1943, she was damaged while bombarding Sicily during the Allied invasion of Sicily.

&quot;Erebus&quot; was used for coastal bombardment during the Normandy Landings on 6 June 1944, firing at the batteries at Barfleur and La Pernelle. She suffered one 15-inch gun destroyed due to a premature explosion of a high explosive round in the bore.

On 10 August 1944, she was used against the defenders of the harbour at Le Havre. She was damaged by the battery at Clos des Ronces and was out of action for some time. In November 1944, she supported Operation Infatuate, the amphibious assault on Walcheren, Netherlands.

She was scrapped in July 1946. It is believed that one of &quot;Erebus&quot;″ 15-inch guns was used to equip , the Royal Navy&#x27;s last battleship.
