<text>Gordon James McMaster (13 February 1960 – 28 July 1997) was a Scottish politician and horticulturist.

==Life and career==
McMaster was born in Johnstone. A horticulturist by training, he was also a lecturer at his alma mater, the Woodburn House Horticultural College. McMaster was very well-liked by his students for his knowledge and charm.

In 1980, McMaster was elected to the Johnstone Community Council, and became its chair in 1982, at the age of 22, making him the youngest chair of any Scottish council. He was elected to the Renfrew District Council in 1984 and became its leader in 1987. He was elected to the House of Commons for Paisley South in a 1990 by-election, triggered by the death of Norman Buchan. In parliament, he campaigned for the rights of disabled people and against recreational drug use. He served as an opposition whip.

==Death==
McMaster died by suicide in the garage of his home in Johnstone on 28 July 1997, at the age of 37. He had been robbed in London shortly before his death. His suicide note named neighbouring MP Tommy Graham as being responsible for smearing him over an alleged homosexual relationship with Graham&#x27;s employee, 17 year old Scott Anderson. This was denied by Graham, who was subsequently expelled from the Labour Party.

<text>Alexander Whitaker (1585–1616) was an English Anglican theologian who settled in North America in Virginia Colony in 1611 and established two churches near the Jamestown colony. He was also known as &quot;The Apostle of Virginia&quot; by contemporaries.

Born in Cambridge, he was the son of William Whitaker (1548–1595), Protestant scholar and Master of St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Whitaker was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and became a clergyman in the North of England.
Travelling to Virginia in 1611, he was a popular religious leader with both settlers and natives, and was responsible for the baptism and conversion of Pocahontas at Henricus two years later. She took the baptismal name &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Richard Buck presided at her marriage to John Rolfe on April 5, 1614. His relative tolerance of the Native American population that English colonists encountered can be found in his sermons, some of which were sent back to England to help win support for the new colonies in North America. The most famous of these sermons is &quot;Good Newes from Virginia&quot; (1613), in which he describes the native population as &quot;servants of sinne and slaves of the divill,&quot; but also recognizes them as &quot;sons of Adam,&quot; who are &quot;a very understanding generation, quicke of apprehension, suddaine in their despatches, subtile in their dealings, exquisite in their inventions, and industrious in their labour.&quot;
Before leaving England, Whitaker had crossed paths with a York merchant who later became an English naval captain and explorer of New England, Christopher Levett of York. In Whitaker&#x27;s will of 1610, and proved following his death in 1616, Whitaker noted that he owed &quot;Christopher Levite, a linen draper of the city of York&quot; just over £5. Trained as a York merchant, Levett later founded the first settlement at Portland, Maine, where he was granted by the King. The settlement failed.

Whitaker drowned in 1616 while crossing the James River.

<doc id="450972" wikidata="Q5583198" url="?curid=450972" title="Goodbye, Mickey Mouse">
<text>Goodbye, Mickey Mouse is a historical novel by Len Deighton published on 12 October 1982. Set in Britain in early 1944, it tells the story of the 220th Fighter Group of the US Eighth Air Force in the lead up to the Allied invasion of Europe. The Group is based at a fictional airfield in Norfolk named Steeple Thaxted.

==Synopsis==
Each chapter is titled by the name of the main character it deals with. The central storyline revolves around a love affair between a new pilot, Captain James Farebrother, and an English girl, Victoria Cooper. Another major plot line follows Lieutenant Mickey Morse, nicknamed &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, who is racing to be the first American pilot to break Eddie Rickenbacker&#x27;s record of 26 kills from World War I.

===Critical reception===

The New York Times review suggested that the novel successfully evoked wartime Britain, and featured Deighton&#x27;s trademark technical and operational details of the P-51 Mustang fighter which the Group flies. It described the aerial scenes as few and brief but powerfully capturing the terror and excitement of bomber escort missions over Germany.

Simon Mcleish gave the book a mixed review. He stated that &quot;Goodbye Mickey Mouse&quot; is obviously &quot;well researched,&quot; but the research &quot;is presented less obtrusively&quot;. Mcleish also stating that &quot;for the general reader, &quot;Goodbye Mickey Mouse&quot;&quot; is not Deighton&#x27;s most appealing novel, &quot;though it would repay the effort required to read it.&quot;

<doc id="450976" wikidata="Q731300" url="?curid=450976" title="Ian Stevenson">
<text>Ian Pretyman Stevenson (October 31, 1918 – February 8, 2007) was a Canadian-born American psychiatrist, the founder and director of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. He was a professor at the University of Virginia School of Medicine for fifty years. He was chair of their department of psychiatry from 1957 to 1967, Carlson Professor of Psychiatry from 1967 to 2001, and Research Professor of Psychiatry from 2002 until his death in 2007. He was founder and director of the University of Virginia School of Medicine&#x27;s Division of Perceptual Studies and helped to found the Society for Scientific Exploration in 1982. 

He is best known for his research into evidence of reincarnation – the premise that emotions, memories, and even physical bodily features can be passed on from one life to another. Over his forty years of international research, he amassed three thousand cases of children who claimed to remember past lives. Stevenson was the author of around three hundred papers and fourteen books on reincarnation, including &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation&quot; (1966), &quot;Reincarnation and Biology&quot; and its simplified version &quot;Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect&quot; (both 1997), and &quot;European Cases of the Reincarnation Type&quot; (2003). 

Stevenson was cautious in making claims about reincarnation. He emphasized that the information he collected was suggestive of reincarnation but &quot;was not flawless and it certainly does not compel such a belief.&quot; He did, however, believe he had produced a body of evidence for reincarnation that should be taken seriously. His position was that reincarnation might possibly represent a third contributing factor, in addition to genetics and the environment, in the development of certain phobias, philias, unusual abilities, and illnesses.

In an obituary for Stevenson in &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Margalit Fox wrote that Stevenson&#x27;s supporters saw him as a misunderstood genius, that his detractors regarded him as earnest but gullible, but that most scientists had simply ignored his research. Stevenson&#x27;s critics contend that ultimately his conclusions are undermined by confirmation bias and motivated reasoning, and were reliant on anecdotal evidence rather than controlled experimental work. His case reports were also criticized for containing errors and omissions. Upon his retirement, Stevenson&#x27;s work was continued by research colleagues such as Jim B. Tucker, Antonia Mills, Satwant Pasricha, and Erlendur Haraldsson.

==Background==

===Personal life and education===
Ian Stevenson was born in Montreal and raised in Ottawa, one of three children. His father, John Stevenson, was a Scottish lawyer who was working in Ottawa as the Canadian correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; of London or &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His mother, Ruth, had an interest in theosophy and an extensive library on the subject, to which Stevenson attributed his own early interest in the paranormal. As a child he was often bedridden with bronchitis, a condition that continued into adulthood and engendered in him a lifelong love of books. According to Emily Williams Kelly, a colleague of his at the University of Virginia, he maintained a list of the books he had read, which numbered 3,535 between 1935 and 2003.

He studied medicine at St. Andrews University in Scotland from 1937 to 1939, but had to complete his studies in Canada because of the outbreak of the Second World War. He graduated from McGill University with a B.S.c. in 1942 and an M.D. in 1943. He was married to Octavia Reynolds from 1947 until her death in 1983. In 1985, he married Dr. Margaret Pertzoff (1926–2009), professor of history at Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College. She did not share his views on the paranormal, but tolerated them with what Stevenson called &quot;benevolent silences.&quot;

===Early career===
After graduating, Stevenson conducted research in biochemistry. His first residency was at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal (1944–1945), but his lung condition continued to bother him, and one of his professors at McGill advised him to move to Arizona for his health. He took up a residency at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona (1945–1946). After that, he held a fellowship in internal medicine at the Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation in New Orleans, became a Denis Fellow in Biochemistry at Tulane University School of Medicine (1946–1947), and a Commonwealth Fund Fellow in Medicine at Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital (1947–1949). He became a U.S. citizen in 1949.

Emily Williams Kelly writes that Stevenson became dissatisfied with the reductionism he encountered in biochemistry, and wanted to study the whole person. He became interested in psychosomatic medicine, psychiatry and psychoanalysis, and in the late 1940s, worked at New York Hospital exploring psychosomatic illness and the effects of stress, and in particular why, for example, one person&#x27;s response to stress might be asthma and another&#x27;s high blood pressure.

He taught at Louisiana State University School of Medicine from 1949 to 1957 as assistant, then associate, professor of psychiatry.

In the 1950s, he met Aldous Huxley (1894–1963), known for his advocacy of psychedelic drugs, and studied the effects of L.S.D. and mescaline, one of the first academics to do so. Ian Stevenson, in his course of studies, tried and studied L.S.D. himself, describing three days of &quot;perfect serenity.&quot; He wrote that at the time he felt he could &quot;never be angry again,&quot; but added, &quot;As it happens that didn&#x27;t work out, but the memory of it persisted as something to hope for.&quot;

From 1951, he studied psychoanalysis at the New Orleans Psychoanalytic Institute and the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute, graduating from the latter in 1958, a year after being appointed head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Virginia. The orthodoxy within psychiatry and psychoanalysis at the time held that the personality is more plastic in one&#x27;s early years, so when he argued against this in his paper &quot;Is the human personality more plastic in infancy and childhood?&quot; (&quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, 1957) his paper was not received well by his colleagues. He wrote that their response prepared him for the rejection he experienced over his work on the paranormal.

==Reincarnation research==
===Early interest===

Stevenson described as the leitmotif of his career his interest in why one person would develop one disease, and another something different. He came to believe that neither environment nor heredity could account for certain fears, illnesses and special abilities, and that some form of personality or memory transfer might provide a third type of explanation. He acknowledged, however, the absence of evidence of a physical process by which a personality could survive death and transfer to another body, and he was careful not to commit himself fully to the position that reincarnation occurs. He argued only that his case studies could not, in his view, be explained by environment or heredity, and that &quot;reincarnation is the best – even though not the only – explanation for the stronger cases we have investigated.&quot; He said in 1974, looking back on his work:

[W]hat I do believe is that, of the cases we now know, reincarnation--at least for some--is the best explanation that we have been able to come up with. There is an impressive body of evidence and it is getting stronger all the time. I think a rational person, if he wants, can believe in reincarnation on the basis of evidence.In 1958 and 1959, Stevenson contributed several articles and book reviews to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; about parapsychology, including psychosomatic illness and extrasensory perception, and in 1958, he submitted the winning entry to a competition organized by the American Society for Psychical Research, in honor of the philosopher William James (1842–1910). The prize was for the best essay on &quot;paranormal mental phenomena and their relationship to the problem of survival of the human personality after bodily death.&quot; Stevenson&#x27;s essay, &quot;The Evidence for Survival from Claimed Memories of Former Incarnations&quot; (1960), reviewed forty-four published cases of people, mostly children, who claimed to remember past lives. It caught the attention of Eileen J. Garrett (1893–1970), the founder of the Parapsychology Foundation, who gave Stevenson a grant to travel to India to interview a child who was claiming to have past-life memories. According to Jim Tucker, Stevenson found twenty-five other cases in just four weeks in India and was able to publish his first book on the subject in 1966, &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation&quot;.

Chester Carlson (1906–1968), the inventor of xerography, offered further financial help. Jim Tucker writes that this allowed Stevenson to step down as chair of the psychiatry department and set up a separate division within the department, which he called the Division of Personality Studies, later renamed the Division of Perceptual Studies.

When Carlson died in 1968, he left $1,000,000 to the University of Virginia to continue Stevenson&#x27;s work. The bequest caused controversy within the university because of the nature of the research, but the donation was accepted, and Stevenson became the first Carlson Professor of Psychiatry.

===Case studies===
The bequest from Chester Carlson allowed Stevenson to travel extensively, sometimes as much as 55,000 miles a year, collecting around three thousand case studies based on interviews with children from Africa to Alaska.

In one case of claimed reincarnation, as Stevenson recounted it, a newborn girl in Sri Lanka screamed whenever she was carried near a bus or a bath. When she was old enough to talk, he said, she recounted a previous life as a girl of 8 or 9 who drowned after a bus knocked her into a flooded rice paddy; later investigation found the family of just such a dead girl living four or five kilometers away. The two families, Stevenson said, were believed to have had no contact. According to journalist Tom Shroder, &quot;In interviewing witnesses and reviewing documents, Stevenson searched for alternate ways to account for the testimony: that the child came upon the information in some normal way, that the witnesses were engaged in fraud or self-delusion, that the correlations were the result of coincidence or misunderstanding. But in scores of cases, Stevenson concluded that no normal explanation sufficed.&quot;

In some cases, a child in a &quot;past life&quot; case may have birthmarks or birth defects that in some way correspond to physical features of the &quot;previous person&quot; whose life the child seems to remember. Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects&quot; (1997) examined two hundred cases of birth defects or birthmarks on children claiming past-life memories. These included children with malformed or missing fingers who said they recalled the lives of people who had lost fingers; a boy with birthmarks resembling entrance and exit wounds who said he recalled the life of someone who had been shot; and a child with a scar around her skull three centimetres wide who said she recalled the life of a man who had had skull surgery. In many of the cases, in Stevenson&#x27;s view, the witness testimony or autopsy reports appeared to support the existence of the injuries on the deceased&#x27;s body.

Stevenson was cautious about making any definite claims about reincarnation in his research, but felt his body of evidence demanded serious attention. In 1989, he said, &quot;[T]he evidence is not flawless and it certainly does not compel such a belief. Even the best of it is open to alternative interpretations, [but] one can only censure those who say there is no evidence whatever.&quot;

==Reception==

===Criticism===
The &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; referred to Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Cases of the Reincarnation Type&quot; (1975) as a &quot;painstaking and unemotional&quot; collection of cases that were &quot;difficult to explain on any assumption other than reincarnation.&quot; In September 1977, the &quot;Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease&quot; devoted most of one issue to Stevenson&#x27;s research. Writing in the journal, the psychiatrist Harold Lief described Stevenson as a methodical investigator and added, &quot;Either he is making a colossal mistake, or he will be known (I have said as much to him) as &#x27;the Galileo of the 20th century&#x27;.&quot; The issue proved popular: the journal&#x27;s editor, the psychiatrist Eugene Brody, said he had received 300–400 requests for reprints.

Despite this early interest, most scientists ignored Stevenson&#x27;s work. According to his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary, his detractors saw him as &quot;earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition.&quot; Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, that he was too willing to believe them, and that he had asked them leading questions. Robert Todd Carroll wrote in his &quot;Skeptic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; that Stevenson&#x27;s results were subject to confirmation bias, in that cases not supportive of the hypothesis were not presented as counting against it. Leonard Angel, a philosopher of religion, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Stevenson did not follow proper standards. &quot;[B]ut you do have to look carefully to see it; that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s been very persuasive to many people.&quot;

In an article in &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; Angel examined Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation&quot; (1974) and concluded that the research was so poorly conducted as to cast doubt on all Stevenson&#x27;s work. He says that Stevenson failed to clearly and concisely document the claims made before attempting to verify them. Among a number of other faults, Angel says, Stevenson asked leading questions and did not properly tabulate or account for all erroneous statements. Angel writes:

Skeptics have written that Stevenson&#x27;s evidence was anecdotal and by applying Occam&#x27;s razor there are prosaic explanations for the cases without invoking the paranormal. Psychologist and neurologist Terence Hines has written:

Robert Baker wrote that many alleged past-life experiences can be explained in terms of known psychological factors. Baker attributed the recalling of past lives to a mixture of cryptomnesia and confabulation. British author and independent researcher Ian Wilson argued that a large number of Stevenson&#x27;s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a higher caste. He speculated that such cases may represent a scheme to obtain money from the family of the alleged former incarnation.

The philosopher C.T.K. Chari of Madras Christian College in Chennai, a specialist in parapsychology, argued that Stevenson was naive and that the case studies were undermined by his lack of local knowledge. Chari wrote that many of the cases had come from societies, such as that of India, where people believed in reincarnation, and that the stories were simply cultural artifacts; he argued that, for children in many Asian countries, the recall of a past life is the equivalent of an imaginary playmate. The philosopher Keith Augustine made a similar argument.

Responding to this cultural argument, Stevenson said that it was precisely those societies that listened to children&#x27;s claims about past lives, which in Europe or North America would normally be dismissed without investigation. To address the cultural concern, he wrote &quot;European Cases of the Reincarnation Type&quot; (2003), which presented forty cases he had examined in Europe. Moreover, Joseph Prabhu, professor emeritus of philosophy and religion at California State University, wrote that it is not true &quot;that these cases are mainly to be found in cultures, where the belief in reincarnation is prevalent. In July 1974 Stevenson&#x27;s colleague at the University of Virginia, J. G. Pratt, carried out a census of Stevenson&#x27;s cases and found that of the 1339 cases then in Stevenson&#x27;s file, &#x27;the United States has the most, with 324 cases (not counting American Indian and Eskimo) and the next five countries in descending order are Burma (139 cases), India (135), Turkey (114), and Great Britain (111).&#x27;&quot;

The philosopher Paul Edwards, editor-in-chief of Macmillan&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, became Stevenson&#x27;s chief critic. From 1986 onwards, he devoted several articles to Stevenson&#x27;s work, and discussed Stevenson in his &quot;Reincarnation: A Critical Examination&quot; (1996). He argued that Stevenson&#x27;s views were &quot;absurd nonsense&quot; and that when examined in detail his case studies had &quot;big holes&quot; and &quot;do not even begin to add up to a significant counterweight to the initial presumption against reincarnation.&quot; Stevenson, Edwards wrote, &quot;evidently lives in a cloud-cuckoo-land.&quot;

Champe Ransom, whom Stevenson hired as an assistant in the 1970s, wrote an unpublished report about Stevenson&#x27;s work, which Edwards cites in his &quot;Immortality&quot; (1992) and &quot;Reincarnation&quot; (1996). According to Ransom, Edwards wrote, Stevenson asked the children leading questions, filled in gaps in the narrative, did not spend enough time interviewing them, and left too long a period between the claimed recall and the interview; it was often years after the first mention of a recall that Stevenson learned about it. In only eleven of the 1,111 cases Ransom looked at had there been no contact between the families of the deceased and of the child before the interview; in addition, according to Ransom, seven of those eleven cases were seriously flawed. He also wrote that there were problems with the way Stevenson presented the cases, in that he would report his witnesses&#x27; conclusions, rather than the data upon which the conclusions rested. Weaknesses in cases would be reported in a separate part of his books, rather than during the discussion of the cases themselves. Ransom concluded that it all amounted to anecdotal evidence of the weakest kind.

Edwards cited the case of Corliss Chotkin, Jr., in Angoon, Alaska, described by Stevenson, as an example that relied entirely on the word of one woman, the niece of Victor Vincent, a fisherman. (Victor Vincent was the person whose life Corliss Chotkin, Jr., seemed to remember.) Edwards wrote that, among the many weaknesses in the case, the family were religious believers in reincarnation, Chotkin had birthmarks that were said to have resembled scars that Vincent had but Stevenson had not seen Vincent&#x27;s scars, and all the significant details relied on the niece. Edwards said that Stevenson offered no information about her, except that several people told him she had a tendency, as Stevenson put it, to embellish or invent stories. Edwards wrote that similar weaknesses could be found in all Stevenson&#x27;s case studies.

Edwards charged that Stevenson referred to himself as a scientist but did not act like one. According to Edwards, he failed to respond to, or even mention, significant objections; the large bibliography in Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Children Who Remember Previous Lives&quot; (1987) does not include one paper or book from his opponents.

 Stevenson wrote an introduction to a book, &quot;Second Time Round&quot; (1975), in which Edward Ryall, an Englishman, told of what he believed to be his memories of a past life as John Fletcher, a man who was born in 1645 in Taunton, England, and died forty years later near his home in Westonzoyland, Somerset. Stevenson investigated the case and discovered that some of the historical features from Ryall&#x27;s book were accurate. Stevenson wrote, &quot;I think it most probable that he has memories of a real previous life and that he is indeed John Fletcher reborn, as he believes himself to be&quot;. In 1976, however, John Taylor discovered that none of the available church records at the Westonzoyland church from 1645 to 1685 had entries for births, marriages, or deaths for the name Fletcher. Since no trace of the name could be found, he concluded that no man called John Fletcher actually existed and that the supposed memories were a fantasy Ryall had developed over the years. Stevenson later altered his opinion about the case. In his book &quot;European Cases of the Reincarnation Type,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I can no longer believe that &quot;all&quot; of Edward Ryall&#x27;s apparent memories derive from a previous life, because some of his details are clearly wrong,&quot; but he still suggested that Ryall acquired some information about 17th-century Somerset by paranormal means.

===Concessions from critics===
Ian Wilson, one of Stevenson’s critics, acknowledged that Stevenson had brought “a new professionalism to a hitherto crank-prone field.” Paul Edwards wrote that Stevenson “has written more fully and more intelligibly in defense of reincarnation than anybody else.” Though faulting Stevenson’s judgment, Edwards wrote: “I have the highest regard for his honesty. All of his case reports contain items that can be made the basis of criticism. Stevenson could easily have suppressed this information. The fact that he did not speaks well for his integrity.”

Carl Sagan referred to what were apparently Stevenson&#x27;s investigations in his book &quot;The Demon-Haunted World&quot; as an example of carefully collected empirical data, and though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories, he wrote that the phenomenon of alleged past-life memories should be further researched.

===Support===

Remi J. Cadoret, wrote in &quot;The American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; that Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;European Cases of the Reincarnation Type&quot; &quot;provides an introduction to an exciting range of [unusual] phenomena and furnishes an inspiring example of a painstaking protocol to sift facts from fancy.&quot;

Lester S. King, pathologist, reviewed the first volume of &quot;Cases of the Reincarnation Type&quot; for the JAMA Journal. King wrote, &quot;He may not convince skeptics, but he has placed on record a large amount of data that cannot be ignored.&quot;

== Xenoglossy ==
Although Stevenson mainly focused on cases of children who seemed to remember past lives, he also studied two cases in which adults under hypnosis seemed to remember a past life and show rudimentary use of a language they had not learned in the present life. Stevenson called this phenomenon &quot;xenoglossy.&quot; The linguist Sarah Thomason, critiquing these cases, wrote that Stevenson is &quot;unsophisticated about language&quot; and that the cases are unconvincing. Thomason concluded, &quot;the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy.&quot; William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, wrote that Stevenson corresponded with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner. He said that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist in a period of six years &quot;without raising any discussion about the kinds of thing that linguists would need to know.&quot; Another linguist, William Frawley, wrote, &quot;Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics.&quot;

==Retirement==

Stevenson stepped down as director of the Division of Perceptual Studies in 2002, although he continued to work as Research Professor of Psychiatry. Bruce Greyson, editor of the &quot;Journal of Near-Death Studies&quot;, became director of the division. Jim Tucker, the department&#x27;s associate professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences, continued Stevenson&#x27;s research with children, examined in Tucker&#x27;s book, &quot;Life Before Life: A Scientific Investigation of Children&#x27;s Memories of Previous Lives&quot; (2005).

==Death and experiment==
Stevenson died of pneumonia on February 8, 2007, at his home in Charlottesville, Virginia. In his will he endowed the Stevenson Chair in Philosophy and History of Science including Medicine, at McGill University Department of Social Studies of Medicine.

As one experiment to test for personal survival of bodily death, in the 1960s Stevenson set a combination lock using a secret word or phrase and placed it in a filing cabinet in the department, telling his colleagues he would try to pass the code to them after his death. Emily Williams Kelly told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Presumably, if someone had a vivid dream about him, in which there seemed to be a word or a phrase that kept being repeated—I don&#x27;t quite know how it would work—if it seemed promising enough, we would try to open it using the combination suggested.&quot;

<doc id="450977" wikidata="Q5982982" url="?curid=450977" title="Ian Stewart (Labour politician)">
<text>Ian Stewart (born 28 August 1950) is a British Labour Party politician who was the member of parliament (MP) for Eccles from 1997 until 2010, when his seat was abolished and he was subsequently defeated in the selection process to be the Labour Parliamentary Candidate for the new parliamentary constituency of Salford and Eccles by Hazel Blears.

Standing as the Labour candidate for the new elected post of Mayor of Salford, he was elected as Mayor in the 2012 Salford mayoral election.

==Early life==

Stewart attended Calder Street Junior Secondary School (now Auchinraith Primary School) in Blantyre and Alfred Turner Secondary Modern in Irlam. From 1966 to 1969, he studied at Stretford Technical College. He later attended Manchester Metropolitan University, where he carried out research towards a M.Phil in Management of Change. Stewart worked as a chemical plant operator from 1973 to 1978 before becoming the North West Regional Officer of the Transport and General Workers Union.

==MP for Eccles==
Stewart was first elected as member of parliament (MP) for Eccles in 1997. He was a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Football Team.

==Mayor of Salford==
Upon his election as Mayor of Salford in 2012, Stewart appointed one deputy and 13 assistant mayors, including one in charge of &#x27;humanegement&#x27;, a nonsense word invented by Stewart to refer to human resources.

In 2013, Stewart urged the government to rethink spending cuts claiming thousands of residents will be pushed further into poverty, saying: &quot;Salford has been forced to cut almost £100 million from council services since 2010. We have tried to increase our income in a number of ways, but it is an uphill battle. Without this funding I fear for the many families who are being asked to contribute more, whilst they have suffered a loss in benefits income.&quot;

In October 2013, Stewart launched the &#x27;City Plan&#x27; which set the priories of Salford City Council over the following three years. Stewart said: &quot;It is my firm hope that the City Plan will help to guide Salford through austerity and the £75 million in government cuts to council services which we face over the next three years.&quot;

Stewart welcomed the convictions and praised the work of Salford City Council trading standards officers after a sex slave was discovered in an Eccles cellar. Stewart said: &quot;We believe this girl was brought into the country illegally in 2000 and fell into the clutches of these evil men when she was just 10 years old.&quot;

Stewart stepped down before the 2016 mayoral election.

==Personal life==
He married Merilyn Holding in 1968. They have two sons and a daughter.

<text>Carl De Keyzer (27 December 1958) is a Belgian photographer. Major subjects in his work have included the collapse of the Soviet Union, and India. He became a full member of Magnum Photos in 1994. De Keyzer has exhibited his work in many European galleries and has received several awards, including the Book Award from Rencontres d&#x27;Arles, the W. Eugene Smith Award and the Kodak Award.

==Career==
De Keyzer was born on 27 December 1958, in Kortrijk, Belgium. His freelance career began in 1982, at which time he also taught at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Ghent, Belgium. During this time, he co-founded the XYZ-Photography Gallery.

Major subjects in his work have included the collapse of Soviet Union and India. Robert Koch gallery describes his work as investigating &quot;marginalized social groups and constructs uncritical psychological portraits which work to familiarize the &#x27;other.&#x27;&quot;

He was nominated to the Magnum Photos agency in 1990, became an associated member in 1992 and a full member in 1994. He currently lives in Ghent and continues to teach.

In late 2024, he stirred controversy with a new book called &quot;Putin’s Dream&quot;, created with the help of AI. It is intended as a harsh criticism of Putin’s Russia. The book drew both fierce criticism as well as praise for its pushing of boundaries, openness to working with new technologies and interrogating the place of AI in the future of photography. Magnum Photos have distanced themselves from the book.

<doc id="450981" wikidata="Q338231" url="?curid=450981" title="Brian Wilson (Labour politician)">
<text>Brian David Henderson Wilson (born 13 December 1948) is a former Scottish Labour Party politician. He was Member of Parliament for Cunninghame North from 1987 until 2005 and served as a minister of state from 1997 to 2003.

After standing down as a minister prior to his departure from Parliament, he was asked by Tony Blair to act as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Special Representative on Overseas Trade. Having continued to take an interest in trade promotion, he was appointed to the newly re-established UK Board of Trade in 2017. He is also chairman of Harris Tweed Hebrides, a director of Celtic Football Club and visiting professor at the University of Strathclyde.

==Early life and career==
Wilson was born in 1948 in Dunoon, Scotland and educated at the co-educational, comprehensive Dunoon Grammar School. He then studied at the University of Dundee and University College, Cardiff - where he was one of the first intake of 16 to the first-ever postgraduate journalism course in the UK, run by Tom Hopkinson of &quot;Picture Post&quot; fame. Wilson was the founding editor and publisher of the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot; which he established along with three friends from Dundee University. In his student days, they had worked together promoting entertainment. In a BBC Alba documentary on his career, Wilson described promoting Pink Floyd in Dunoon in September 1968 as &quot;the apex of my career&quot;. The early days of the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot; were subsidised by revenue from entertainment promotion.

Founded in 1972, the newspaper was initially based at Kyleakin, on the isle of Skye, and continues to be published from Broadford, Skye. Its uniqueness lay in the radicalism of its political content, particularly on matters relating to the ownership of land, and its role as a local newspaper. It is credited with having exerted a strong influence over political debate in the Highlands and Islands, and - along with other concurrent initiatives such as the 7.84 production, &quot;The Cheviot, the Stag and the Black, Black Oil&quot; and publication of John MacEwen&#x27;s book &quot;Who Owns Scotland?&quot; - restoring the land question to a place of prominence in Scottish politics. For his early work on the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot;, Wilson was made the first recipient of the Nicholas Tomalin Memorial Award. He also wrote widely for national newspapers and, in 1977–78 he was involved in &quot;Seven Days&quot;, a political weekly in Scotland which folded after a few months. 

Throughout the 1980s, one of his roles was as Scottish football correspondent of the &quot;Guardian&quot;, which led to him being invited to write the official history of Celtic FC, the team he had supported from childhood. He appeared in the influential 1980s LWT documentary in the Credo series which highlighted sectarianism in Scottish football when Wilson called for UEFA and FIFA to force the SFA to bring an end to Rangers&#x27; sectarian employment policy.

He was a member of the Scottish National Party for a short time in his teens, but shortly after the formation of the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot;, which was launched in April 1972, joined the Labour Party and was soon invited to stand as its candidate in Ross and Cromarty which he contested in October 1974. He stood in two other Highlands and Islands constituencies - Inverness-shire and the Western Isles - in 1979 and 1983 respectively. An opponent of devolution, which he believed would work to the disadvantage of Scotland&#x27;s more peripheral areas, in 1978 he was chairman of the &quot;Labour Vote No Campaign&quot;, which called for a &quot;no&quot; vote in the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum on whether to have a Scottish Assembly. Wilson was part of a group known as the &quot;Highland Luxemburgists&quot; (that included Margaret Hope MacPherson and Allan Campbell McLean), who attempted each year at the party conference to pass a resolution to bring the crofts back into common ownership. However, the Labour Party leadership ignored the resolution and supported right of crofters to purchase their land.

==Political career==

Wilson was selected to fight a more winnable seat and was elected to serve Cunninghame North constituency in 1987, winning the seat from the Conservative Party, and successfully held the seat in the 1992, 1997 and 2001 general elections. In opposition, Wilson was spokesperson on election planning (1996–1997), trade and industry (1994–1995), transport (1992–1994 and 1995–1996)—where he was recognised as an effective Parliamentary opponent of rail privatisation— and on Scottish affairs (1988–1992).

In his first ministerial role, as Scottish Office Minister for Education and Industry, he had responsibility for the Highlands and Islands which allowed him to deliver on some of the issues he had campaigned for over a long period. He established the Community Land Unit and the Fund on which community buy-outs of crofting estates was based. He was Scotland&#x27;s first designated Minister for Gaelic, initiating the process which led to the establishment of a Gaelic television channel. Along with the Irish President, Mary Robinson, he launched Iomairt Cholm Cille in an effort to bring closer together the Gaelic-speaking communities of Scotland and Ireland. As Scottish Education Minister, he took a particular interest in Special Educational Needs and established the Beattie Committee to bring forward proposals, many of which were subsequently introduced, to improve post-school provision and strengthen SEN links with Further Education colleges.

In 2001, Wilson briefly served at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with responsibility for Africa. In 2003, he voted in favour of the Iraq War. As Energy Minister from 2001 to 2003, he was a strong supporter of both renewable energy—which he had long championed as a journalist—and nuclear power, not least because of his familiarity with Hunterston nuclear power stations in his own constituency. According to one&#x27;s point of view, he is either credited or blamed for doing more than any other politician to &quot;keep the nuclear option open&quot; through the early years of the Labour government, when many of his colleagues were determined to kill it off once and for all in Britain. As Energy Minister, Wilson always advocated what he termed a &quot;balanced&quot; power generation policy—including nuclear, coal pollution mitigation, natural gas and renewables—which eventually became the catch-phrase of government after his departure. Speaking at the Institution of Civil Engineers in June 2008, he joked if he had remained in politics, he would have been &quot;knocked down in the rush&quot; as his former foes on the nuclear issue—including the likes of Gordon Brown and Margaret Beckett—adopted the same position.

As trade minister and subsequently, Wilson took a great deal of interest in Cuba which he visited on a number of occasions in an effort to improve political and trade links. He has written extensively in defence of Cuba and about his meetings with Fidel Castro. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about Castro&#x27;s decision to step down as Cuban President, Wilson said he had &quot;outwitted the United States and its 50-year obsession one last time&quot; by ensuring an orderly transition in government while he was still alive. While trade minister, Wilson was also closely involved in defending the Scottish cashmere industry in the face of hostile trade measures by the United States, during the so-called &quot;Banana Wars&quot; (1999–2000).

In August 2004, he announced his intention to step down from politics at the 2005 general election for family reasons.

==Later career==

Wilson holds directorships in a number of businesses and continues to publicly comment on British Government energy policy, particularly on the subject of nuclear power, of which he is a supporter, and has written opinion pieces in national newspapers as well as appearing on television news programmes to air his views. Both as Energy Minister and subsequently, he has called for Britain to retain a balanced energy policy with contributions to our electricity needs from nuclear, renewables, coal pollution mitigation, and gas. He was also chair of Flying Matters which advocated a pro-aviation response to climate change. In April 2008, Wilson became a visiting professor in Media and Government at Glasgow Caledonian University. In September 2009, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by the University of the Highlands and Islands. Between 2009, and 2013, he was chair of Britain&#x27;s Energy Coast, the economic development agency for West Cumbria. In 2017, he became a visiting professor at the University of Strathclyde. He was appointed a UK Business Ambassador under the coalition government in a non-political capacity in 2013 and continues to hold the role.

He has been closely identified with regeneration of the Harris Tweed industry in the Isle of Lewis, where he lives, and is chairman of Harris Tweed Hebrides who were named Textile Brand of the Year at the Vogue.com Scottish Fashion Awards in both 2009 and 2011 as well as UK Textile Company of the Year at the UK Fashion and Textile Awards in 2013. He is also a director of Celtic Football Club, which he has supported since childhood. Wilson wrote Celtic&#x27;s official centenary history (Celtic, A Century With Honour, Collins Willow 1988) and more recently the Official History of Celtic to mark the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary. Having maintained connections with Cuba, he is now chairman of Havana Energy, a UK-based company promoting renewable energy in Cuba which secured the first ever joint venture with the Cubans to build power stations fuelled by biomass from the sugar plantations. In April 2017, Wilson was present at Ciro Redondo in Cuba for the inauguration of the first of four power plants to be built by the JV, named Biopower, Havana Energy having partnered with the Shanghai Electric Company in the face of challenges presented by the US blockade of Cuba.

For his work with Harris Tweed Hebrides, Wilson was named Global Director of the Year at the Institute of Directors Scottish awards ceremony in February 2011. He was then named UK Global Director of the Year at IoD Awards in September 2011. Maintaining his long-standing interest in land reform, he was a director of Community Land Scotland, formed in 2010 as an umbrella body for community-owned estates covering 500,000 acres, mainly in the West Highlands and Islands. In 2013, he became a UK Business Ambassador and was asked by the Secretary of State for Scotland to carry out a review of Scottish exporting, which was published in 2014. He writes regular columns in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; and other publications. Up until July 2015, he wrote regular columns for the &quot;West Highland Free Press&quot;, which had been sold to its employees by the founders in 2008, and of which he had been the founding editor, but was controversially sacked when he defended fellow columnist Donald Macleod, who had written a piece about the spread of Islam in the UK. Wilson defended MacLeod&#x27;s right to freedom of expression before he too was told in an e-mail from the editor his columns were no longer wanted. A third columnist, Maggie Cunningham, resigned in protest.

Wilson took an active role in opposing a &quot;Yes&quot; vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum and spoke at many rallies of the &quot;Just Say Naw&quot; campaign alongside George Galloway.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to charity and business in Scotland.

== Personal life ==
Wilson lives in Mangersta in the Uig area of the Isle of Lewis, which is the home village of his wife, Joni Buchanan. They have three children - Mairi, Eoin and Ronan. Eoin has Down&#x27;s Syndrome and Wilson has spoken out and written strongly against &quot;the assumption&quot; testing to identify the condition in pregnancy is &quot;an undisputed good&quot;, particularly when it is not accompanied by balanced advice on options thereafter.

<doc id="450984" wikidata="Q5981633" url="?curid=450984" title="Ian Gibson (politician)">
<text>Ian Gibson (26 September 1938 – 9 April 2021) was a British Labour politician and scientist who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich North from 1997 to 2009.

Gibson was a professor at the University of East Anglia before his election to Parliament and was considered one of the country&#x27;s leading cancer experts. He chaired the Science and Technology Committee in the House of Commons from 2001 to 2005 and came into conflict with the Blair government due to his left-wing views. He resigned from the Commons in 2009 after being barred from standing as a Labour candidate in the 2010 general election due to his behaviour during the parliamentary expenses scandal.

== Early life and academic career ==
Ian Gibson was born in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of William and Winifred Gibson, in September 1938. He was educated at the Dumfries Academy before attending the University of Edinburgh, where he acquired a Bachelor of Science degree in Genetics and a doctorate. Whilst at university in Scotland he also turned out for professional Scottish football sides Airdrie, St Mirren and Queen of the South. He continued his studies in the US at Indiana University Bloomington and the University of Washington.

During the 1960s, he was a keen amateur footballer and played for local side Wymondham Town as a left-back and captain of the team.

Gibson worked for the University of East Anglia from 1965 until his election to Parliament and was made an honorary professor in 2003. He worked as a research scientist until 1971, when he became a senior biology lecturer and was promoted to Dean of the School of Biological Sciences in 1991. Whilst a Dean, he headed a research team investigating cancer because of his expertise in the biology of cancer and drugs targeting leukaemia. Upon his suggestion, Norwich City goalkeeper Bryan Gunn funded the Francesca Gunn laboratory, named after the daughter he lost to leukaemia, which he ran for five years. He was awarded a Champion Award by Macmillan Cancer Support for his work. He was not known to have any political views before his employment at the university. However, he became active in the union ASTMS and fought for better pay for technical and other less senior staff.

== Parliamentary career ==
Gibson was a member of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance union executive from 1972 to 1996 and joined the Labour Party in 1983 after seven years in the Socialist Workers Party.

He unsuccessfully contested the marginal Norwich North constituency at the 1992 general election, losing to the Conservative incumbent Patrick Thompson by 266 votes. However, following Thompson&#x27;s retirement, he won the seat at the 1997 general election with a majority of over 9,000. Gibson was successfully re-elected in 2001 and 2005, albeit with a reduced majority of between 5,000 and 6,000 at both elections. He made his maiden speech on 17 June 1997.

Joining the Science and Technology Select Committee upon his election, Gibson used his platform to push the case for science and better cancer treatment. He chaired the committee from 2001 to 2005, despite opposition from Labour whips, as well as the All-Party Parliamentary Group on cancer. Gibson raised many medical and biological issues in the House of Commons, including Gulf War syndrome, which he urged the government to recognise. He later became a member of other committees, including the Innovation, Universities, Science and Skills Select Committee and the East of England Regional Select Committee.

Although well-liked on all sides, Gibson was often in conflict with the Blair government and a problem for the government whips due to his left-wing views. He was a major campaigner against top-up fees for universities. He voted against parts of the government&#x27;s counterterrorism legislation, leading him to clash with fellow Norwich MP Charles Clarke. He was also the coach of the cross-party parliamentary football team, and from 1999 to 2005 he was the team&#x27;s joint manager.

He suffered a minor stroke in September 2004 on a visit to Ramallah in the West Bank, leading him to call for stroke support to be prioritised by health services in the same way as cancer care.

In 2006, he took part in a BBC television &quot;Inside Out&quot; programme, &quot;Clouds of Secrecy&quot;. The programme reported on the high incidence of oesophageal cancer in the Norfolk area and the possible link with secret experiments the Ministry of Defence carried out in the 1960s with poisonous chemicals. Gibson expressed the hope that further research might occur to establish whether there was a link between these tests and the high local rates of cancer of the oesophagus. In the same year, he attracted controversy after claiming inbreeding in his constituency may have played a part in its rising number of diabetes cases, but later apologised for these remarks.

Gibson announced his intention to stand in the next election in 2006, stating that he would rather &quot;die with my boots on and go missing in action than crawl into early retirement and wear slippers and pantaloons&quot;.

=== Expenses scandal ===

In May 2009, Gibson became embroiled in the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal, reportedly claiming for a flat in which his daughter lived rent-free before selling it to her for half its market value. He was barred from standing in the 2010 general election by a Labour Party disciplinary panel, which his constituency chairman called a &quot;kangaroo court&quot;.

Saying that his position was &quot;untenable&quot; after the panel&#x27;s decision, he resigned as an MP by applying for the Chiltern Hundreds. In the subsequent 2009 Norwich North by-election, Conservative Chloe Smith won the seat over the Labour candidate, who saw the party&#x27;s vote share drop by almost 27%.

== After Parliament ==
Following his resignation, Gibson continued campaigning on local and environmental issues in Norwich and returned to lecturing at institutions including Harvard University. He became Norwich Palestine Solidarity Campaign president in 2015.

From 2009 to 2013, he was a journalist at the &quot;Norwich Evening News&quot;.

Gibson was pleased when Jeremy Corbyn, an old friend, was elected as Labour leader; however, he was later alleged to have said that Corbyn lacked &quot;leadership and style&quot;, after becoming disillusioned with his performance as leader.

== Personal life ==
Gibson&#x27;s first wife was Verity, a social worker with whom he had two children. He is survived by his daughter, Dominique, but their other daughter, Ruth, died in 1993. In 1977, he married Liz, with whom he had another daughter.

He supported Norwich City and served as the president of his former club, Wymondham Town. Later, he also joined a Norwich theatre group. According to &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, he listed his recreations as &quot;football coaching, watching, listening and questioning&quot;.

Gibson died in Norfolk, of pancreatic cancer, on 9 April 2021, at the age of 82.

<doc id="450990" wikidata="Q366756" url="?curid=450990" title="Leroy Anderson">
<text>Leroy Anderson ( ) (June 29, 1908 – May 18, 1975) was an American composer of short, light concert pieces, many of which were introduced by the Boston Pops Orchestra under the direction of Arthur Fiedler. John Williams described him as &quot;one of the great American masters of light orchestral music.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Swedish parents, Anderson was given his first piano lessons by his mother, who was a church organist. He continued studying piano at the New England Conservatory of Music. In 1925, Anderson entered Harvard College, where he studied musical harmony with Walter Spalding, counterpoint with Edward Ballantine, canon and fugue with William C. Heilman, orchestration with Edward B. Hill and Walter Piston, composition, also with Piston, and double bass with Gaston Dufresne. He also studied organ with Henry Gideon. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, magna cum laude in 1929 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. At Harvard University Graduate School, he studied composition with Walter Piston and George Enescu and received a Master of Arts in Music in 1930. He and his brother played in dance orchestras on Scandinavian cruise ships in the summers of 1930 and 1931.

==Career==
Anderson continued studying at Harvard, working towards a PhD in German and Scandinavian languages; Anderson spoke English and Swedish during his youth, and eventually became fluent in Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, German, French, Italian, and Portuguese.

At the time, he was working as organist and choir director at the East Milton Congregational Church, leading the Harvard University Band, and conducting and arranging for dance bands around Boston. In 1936 his arrangements came to the attention of Arthur Fiedler, who asked to see any original compositions that he could use in his concerts as the 18th conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra at Symphony Hall. Anderson&#x27;s first work was the 1938 &quot;Jazz Pizzicato&quot;, but at just over ninety seconds, the piece was too short for a three-minute 78 rpm single of the period. Fiedler suggested writing a companion piece, and Anderson wrote &#x27;&quot;Jazz Legato&quot; later that same year. The combined recording went on to become one of Anderson&#x27;s signature compositions.

In 1942, Anderson joined the United States Army, and was assigned in Iceland with the U.S. Counterintelligence Corps as a translator and interpreter, writing as well as monitoring local news media; in 1945 he was reassigned to the Pentagon as Chief of the Scandinavian Desk of Military Intelligence. His duties did not, however, prevent him from composing, and in 1945 he wrote &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot; and &quot;Promenade&quot;. Anderson became a reserve officer and was recalled to active duty for the Korean War. He wrote his first hit, &quot;Blue Tango&quot;, in 1951, earning a Golden Disc and the No. 1 spot on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

His pieces and his recordings during the 1950s conducting a studio orchestra were immense commercial successes. &quot;Blue Tango&quot; was the first instrumental recording ever to sell one million copies. His most famous pieces are probably &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; and &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot;. In February 1951, WCBS-TV in New York City selected &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot; as the theme song for &quot;The Late Show&quot;, the WCBS late-night movie, using Percy Faith&#x27;s recording. Mitchell Parish added words to &quot;The Syncopated Clock&quot;, and later wrote lyrics for other Anderson tunes, including &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, which was not written as a Christmas piece, but as a work that describes a winter event. Anderson started the work during a heat wave in August 1946. The Boston Pops&#x27; recording of it was the first pure orchestral piece to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Music chart. From 1952 to 1961, Anderson&#x27;s composition &quot;Plink, Plank, Plunk!&quot; was used as the theme for the CBS panel show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;.

Anderson&#x27;s musical style employs creative instrumental effects and occasionally makes use of sound-generating items such as typewriters and sandpaper.

Anderson wrote his Piano Concerto in C in 1953 but withdrew it, feeling that it had weak spots. The Anderson family decided to publish the work in 1988. Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra released the first recording of this work; four other recordings, including one for piano and organ, have since been released.

In 1958, Anderson composed the music for the Broadway show &quot;Goldilocks&quot; with orchestrations by Philip J. Lang. Even though it earned two Tony awards, &quot;Goldilocks&quot; did not achieve commercial success. Anderson never wrote another musical, preferring instead to continue writing orchestral miniatures. His pieces, including &quot;The Typewriter&quot;, &quot;Bugler&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, and &quot;A Trumpeter&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; are performed by orchestras and bands ranging from school groups to professional organizations.

Anderson appeared with the Boston Pops on May 18, 1972, which was broadcast by PBS. He conducted &quot;The Typewriter&quot; as an encore, and Arthur Fiedler played the carriage return percussive part. The Boston Pops used the audio of that performance along with some video in a tribute film to Fiedler.

Anderson was initiated as an honorary member of the Gamma Omega chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at Indiana State University in 1969.

==Personal life==
Anderson married Eleanor Jane Firke in 1942. They raised two sons and a daughter, while living in a custom-designed house in Woodbury, Connecticut.

==Death==
In 1975, Anderson died of cancer in Woodbury, Connecticut and was buried there. He was 66.

==In popular culture==
For his contribution to the recording industry, Leroy Anderson has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1620 Vine Street. He was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1988, and his music continues to be a staple of &quot;pops&quot; orchestra repertoire. In 1995 the new headquarters of the Harvard University Band was named the Anderson Band Center in honor of Leroy Anderson. The Leroy Anderson House in Woodbury, Connecticut has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2006, one of his piano works, &quot;Forgotten Dreams&quot;, written in 1954, became the background for a British TV advertisement for mobile phone company 3. Previously, Los Angeles station KABC-TV used the song as its sign-off theme at the end of broadcast days in the 1980s, and Mantovani&#x27;s recording of the song had been the closing theme for WABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; for much of the 1970s. &quot;Forgotten Dreams&quot; was used as a recurring theme in the French film &quot;Populaire&quot; (2012).

&quot;The Typewriter&quot; was used as the theme song for &quot;Esto no tiene nombre&quot;, a Puerto Rican television comedy program produced by Tommy Muñiz between the late 1960s and late 1970s. It is also the signature tune for the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The News Quiz&quot;, which has been running since 1977.

American comedian Jerry Lewis, dressed in formal wear as &quot;Pietro Del Canto,&quot; performed &quot;The Typewriter&quot; as the typist in a sketch in an early television program. He reprised his performance in the 1963 motion picture &quot;Who&#x27;s Minding the Store?&quot;, &quot;typing&quot; on an imaginary typewriter.

<text>Remote Control is an American TV game show that ran on MTV for five seasons from 1987 until 1990. It was MTV&#x27;s first original non-musical program and first game show. A concurrent syndicated version of the series ran during the 1989–1990 season and was distributed by Viacom. Three contestants answered trivia questions on movies, music, and television, many of which were presented in skit format.

The series was created and developed by producers Joe Davola and Michael Dugan. It was written by Michael Armstrong (head writer seasons 2–3), Desmond Devlin, Emily Dodi, Michael Dugan (head writer season 1), Lee Frank, Bob Giordano, Phil Gurin, Keith Kaczorek (also credited as Kadillac Keith), Chris Kreski (head writer seasons 4–5), Denis Leary, Andrew Price, Colin Quinn, Ned Rice, Richard G. Rosner, Adam Sandler, McPaul Smith and John Ten Eyck. It was directed by Dana Calderwood, Scott Fishman and Milt Lage.

==Cast==
&quot;Remote Control&quot; was hosted by Ken Ober and featured Colin Quinn as the announcer/sidekick. Quinn hosted the final episodes as Ober was away filming the short-lived series &quot;Parenthood&quot;. John Ten Eyck played several walk-on parts, joined in later seasons by Adam Sandler, Denis Leary, and Roger Kabler. Steve Treccase provided music; Marisol Massey (season 1), Kari Wuhrer (seasons 2–3), Alicia Coppola (season 4) and Susan Ashley (season 5) were the hostesses.

==Premise==
The show&#x27;s theme song explains that Ober was addicted to television growing up and desperately wanted to be a game show host. To make his dream come true, he set up the basement of his childhood home as a television studio.
==Set==
&quot;Remote Control&quot; was taped in a Manhattan television studio set up to resemble a basement, complete with a washer and dryer, water heater, bric-a-brac, and a giant Pez dispenser that resembled Bob Eubanks.

The basement set was a mainstay of the show throughout its run; however, its decor was &quot;rearranged&quot; slightly every season. The contestants sat in leather La-Z-Boy recliners with seat belts, complete with retro kidney-shaped tables and scoreboards, facing host Ober and his retro-styled Zenith television. Behind Ober were framed portraits of his idols, game show hosts Eubanks, Bob Barker, Bill Cullen, Bert Convy, Monty Hall, and Tom Kennedy. Musician Steve Treccase set up his keyboard behind a cluttered bar, at which Quinn and the hostess usually sat for the duration of the show. More clutter could be found around and behind the audience, very frequently including props used in previous seasons. Finally, the contestants&#x27; chairs were placed in front of breakaway walls, through which they were unmercifully pulled if they were eliminated.

==Gameplay==
Three contestants sitting in lounge chairs would select one of nine channels on a big-screen television that stood beside Ober; each channel represented a subject having to do with pop culture. Channels covered a wide variety of topics, and included topics such as &quot;The Bon Jovi Network&quot;, &quot;Brady Physics&quot;, and &quot;Dead or Canadian&quot;. Contestants rang in to answer a series of toss-up questions from those subjects to earn points, losing points for an incorrect response. Most channels contained three questions of increasing value, although certain special categories would have either one or two questions. The identity of each channel was only revealed when it was first chosen during a round.

In the first round, the three questions in a standard category were worth 5, 10, and 15 points, in that order. Point values were doubled for the second round, with a new set of nine channels in play. The contestant who answered a question correctly could either stay with the current channel or select a different one; after the last question in a channel was asked, it was taken out of play for the rest of the round.

===Categories/Channels===
Many categories dealt with specific television shows, characters, or genres. Others focused on topics such as celebrities, trivia, and commercials. Categories fell into one of the following general types.
* Standard: humorously worded questions asked by Ober
* Performance-based: questions based on skits or songs acted out by one or more supporting cast members.
* One-time use: a single question or chance to score points, often involving a survey or comedy performance, such as &quot;Sing Along with Colin&quot;, where Colin Quinn would begin a few lines of a song and the contestant needed to correctly add the last line to score the points.
* Beat the clock: Often worded as &quot;Beat the Baloney&quot; or &quot;Beat the Bishop&quot;, a character dressed in costume would make his way through the audience while the contestant was assigned a math problem. Correctly answering the problem before the character circumambulated the studio would earn points.
* Penalty: a channel that resulted in a hidden message where the contestant would be assessed a penalty. Often done as &quot;Wheel of Torture&quot;, where the contestant would be given the option to forgo the torture for a penalty or be awarded points if they endured a schoolyard-type torture from Colin Quinn, such as &quot;Charley Horse&quot;, &quot;Noogie&quot;, &quot;Purple Nurple&quot; or &quot;Wet Willy&quot;. (If a female contestant did this and was selected for &quot;Purple Nurple&quot;, the wheel was re-spun.)

MTV was always one of the available channels, and presented questions associated with music and music videos.

===Snack Break===
At the end of the first round, the contestants were treated to a snack; however, as they were guests of an unconventional host, the snacks were delivered in unusual ways. In the vast majority of episodes, the contestants held bowls above their heads to catch the snack as it was dumped onto them from above, such as popcorn or candy. When the nature of the snack such as cheese and crackers made this method impractical, it would be lowered from above on trays or delivered by the hostess. In some episodes, each contestant was hit with a pie in the face. Sometimes, the snacks would be delivery from a bistro or a pizza place.

During the first season, the Snack Break occurred in the middle of the round, and the contestant in the lead at that point had the chance to win a small prize by correctly guessing which one of three refrigerators held it (similar to the Big Deal on &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;). The other two each held a revolting food item.

===Off the Air===
One of the signature features of &quot;Remote Control&quot; was the way in which contestants were eliminated from play. After round two, the TV went &quot;Off the Air&quot; (accompanied by a siren sound effect and the studio lights flashing on and off), and the contestant in last place at that moment was also thrown &quot;Off the Air&quot; and eliminated from the game. If there was a tie for last place, there was no elimination. Eliminated contestants were removed immediately, chair and all (hence the seat belts). Beginning late in the first season, the audience would also sing a &quot;goodbye song,&quot; typically &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Hit the Road Jack,&quot; or &quot;Hey You, Get Off of My Show&quot; (to the tune of &quot;Get Off of My Cloud&quot;), while said contestant was being ejected. After a contestant was ejected, he/she would be tormented by stagehands administering various annoyances behind him/her while an unrealistic screaming sound effect played. The ejections were accomplished in a variety of ways.

The setup in the first season was very basic. All three contestants were seated in front of breakaway sections in the wall behind them. Upon elimination, the losing contestant was simply pulled in their chair through that section of the wall, which would fall backwards allowing the chair to continue sliding behind the stage. Upon being pulled through, a black curtain was dropped concealing the contestant. Most of the time this was accompanied by the camera shaking violently and a &quot;static&quot; effect to simulate the TV (and the contestant, as mentioned by Ober) going &quot;Off the Air.&quot; On occasion, the chair would return through the wall with the contestant replaced by a skeleton or something else indicating that he or she had been &quot;killed.&quot;

The second season was the first to feature three different kinds of eliminations; also, the camera effects were removed. The contestant on the audience&#x27;s left was pulled backstage through a hidden trap door in the wall, which then closed behind him/her. The contestant in the center sat in front of a large doorway covered with blue paper; upon elimination; he/she was pulled backwards, tearing through it, and a black curtain was lowered over the opening. When the contestant on the right was eliminated, the floor and wall sections around him/her pivoted backwards by 90 degrees, so that the underside of the floor became the wall from the audience&#x27;s perspective as the contestant was flipped out of view.

The third and fourth seasons presented some minor modifications. The flipping chair was now to the audience&#x27;s left, while the center chair was pulled through a breakaway wall and curtain similar to those used in the first season. The contestant on the right was eliminated by being pulled backwards, with the wall section behind him/her rotating 180 degrees horizontally to expose a section of exterior house siding, implying that the contestant had been ejected from the house altogether.

For the fifth season, the curtain behind the breakaway wall was replaced by a black wall with a pattern of jail cell bars, and the wall behind the contestant on the right rotated vertically instead of horizontally.

On at least two occasions (including a 1988 Christmas episode in which the three contestants were actors playing the &quot;Three Wise Men&quot;), the contestants performed so badly in Round 1 that Ober decided to have them all yanked &quot;Off the Air&quot; at the end of it. The scores were reset to zero, and three new contestants took their places to complete the game.

===Lightning round===
During the first season, after the TV went &quot;Off the Air&quot;, gameplay continued as normal with the remaining two contestants until time expired. Beginning with the second season, this format was scrapped for a &quot;lightning round&quot; to determine the winner.

For the second through fourth seasons, the two remaining contestants played a &quot;Think Real Fast&quot; lightning round, answering as many toss-up questions as possible in 30 seconds and receiving 10 points per correct answer. Typically, contestants had to supply a missing word in a title or correct a wrong one. When time ran out, the high scorer advanced to the bonus round and the second-place contestant was eliminated. In the event of a two-way tie for second place or a three-way tie when the TV went &quot;Off the Air,&quot; no one was eliminated at that point; all three contestants played Think Real Fast, and the second- and third-place scorers were both removed at its end.

In the fifth season, all three contestants played a variation of the lightning round called &quot;This, That, or the Other Thing.&quot; Every question had to be answered with one of three similar-sounding choices given by Ober at the start of the round (e.g., &quot;Andy Taylor, Andy Warhol, or Andy Rooney&quot;). The round lasted for 20 seconds, and each answer was worth 10 points; at its end, the TV went &quot;Off the Air&quot; and the third-place scorer was eliminated. The remaining two contestants then played a final question, described below.

===Final question===
In the final season, and the second half of the syndicated version, the two remaining contestants bet any or all of their current score on one final question, usually a math problem. Once the contestants had written down their wagers, Ober read the question and they had 20 seconds to answer it while a bizarre distraction was performed. After time expired, the answers and wagers were checked; a correct answer added a contestant&#x27;s wager to his/her score, while a miss deducted it.

===Tiebreaker===
In all seasons, the surviving contestant with the highest score won the game and a collection of prizes, and went on to the Grand Prize Round. In the event of a tie after the last round, Ober would pull a tiebreaker question from the giant Pez dispenser in the corner; a correct answer won the game, while a miss gave the win to the opponent.

===Grand prize round===
====MTV Version (first 4 seasons)====
The contestant was strapped to a &quot;Craftmatic adjustable bed&quot;, facing a wall of nine TV sets (including two turned sideways and one placed upside down) that were each playing a different music video simultaneously. The contestant had to identify the artists in the videos; each correct response awarded a prize and shut off that TV. Correctly identifying all nine artists within 30 seconds won the grand prize, usually a car or a trip ($5,000 in celebrity episodes). Before the clock started ticking, the contestant was given a split-second glimpse of every video at once. He/she could pass on a video and return to it after playing through all nine if time remained on the clock. The record for the fastest win, 8 seconds, was set by a contestant named Andrea on a November 1989 episode.

====Syndicated Version====
Due to copyright issues, music videos could not be used on the syndicated episodes. Instead, the contestant was strapped to a spinning horizontal wheel surrounded by 10 numbered television monitors and was asked 10 questions (usually about TV). For each question successfully answered, the contestant won a prize and the message &quot;Grand Prize&quot; appeared on the corresponding screen. The contestant had three seconds to answer each question, and could not return to passed or missed questions. After all questions had been asked, the wheel was allowed to slow to a stop, and if the contestant&#x27;s head pointed to a screen that displayed &quot;Grand Prize&quot;, he won the day&#x27;s top prize in addition to any prizes for his correct answers. A contestant who correctly answered every question automatically won the grand prize. A similar bonus round was used on the British version.

====MTV Version (season 5)====
The &quot;name the artist&quot; round was modified to more resemble the syndicated bonus round. The contestant was strapped to a spinning metal wheel placed at a 45-degree angle, with a single TV above it and another below it. As Colin Quinn and other cast members spun the wheel, the contestant had to identify the artists of nine videos that were shown in succession on both screens at once. Correctly identifying all artists in 40 seconds awarded the grand prize. The contestant could pass on a video and return to it later if time permitted.

==Spring Break episodes==
Like most MTV shows of the period, &quot;Remote Control&quot; taped episodes on-location during the network&#x27;s annual &quot;Spring Break&quot; event. The gameplay was altered to account for the absence of the regular studio&#x27;s equipment and props as follows.
* Contestants sat either in beach chairs on platforms that extended over the edge of a swimming pool, or in director&#x27;s chairs near it.
* The nine channels were represented by college-age men and women in swimwear and numbered T-shirts. When a channel was selected, that person removed his/her shirt to reveal a sash marked with the channel name.
* In some episodes, the contestants were given trays of snack food items (such as hot dogs) at the end of the first round and received 5 points for each one they ate before the second round ended. Once the extra points were tallied, the game ended and the two lowest scorers were pushed/thrown into the pool by stagehands. Other episodes followed the same elimination rules as the regular show, with the TV going &quot;Off the Air&quot; and the lowest scorer being tipped/pushed/thrown into the pool, followed by a lightning round to decide the winner.
* For the grand prize round, the winner lay on a floating lounge chair in the pool and had to identify the artists in nine music videos, each displayed for four seconds on a single monitor.

==Celebrities==
Celebrities that appeared on the show included:
* Nipsey Russellthe &quot;Poet Laureate of Television&quot;, who occasionally presented some of his poems.
* Bob Eubankssat by host Ober for the entire main game, and &quot;coached&quot; him on how to host a game show.
* &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankoviccame into the basement as a category/channel. In addition, he also &quot;tortured&quot; that episode&#x27;s two losing contestants as they were eliminated. (This was the only time that the backstage portion of the set behind the contestant area was shown.)
* LL Cool Jmade a brief appearance in one skit, where Ober stormed off stage to discover the rapper and his brother goofing around.
* Jerry Mathersappeared during the second half of a season three episode.
* MC Hammerappeared as an announcer during one of the final episodes, which were shot on location in Daytona Beach, Florida.
Celebrities that played the game:
* One episode featured Phil McConkey of the NFL&#x27;s New York Giants playing against Sidney Green of the NBA&#x27;s New York Knicks (with his then very young son Taurean on the set throughout the show). The third contestant was series regular John Ten Eyck playing Steve Sax of Major League baseball&#x27;s Los Angeles Dodgers. Ten Eyck intentionally gave foolish, incorrect answers as Sax, who had canceled his scheduled appearance at the last minute.
* While in syndication, &quot;Remote Control&quot; had a &quot;World Class Athletes Day&quot; with pro athletes who lost out on championships in recent seasons. The three contestants were Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Boomer Esiason, New York Mets pitcher David Cone and New York Rangers defenseman Ron Greschner.
* LL Cool J, Julie Brown, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic played for charity during the second season, with Yankovic winning.
* Heavy metal musicians &quot;Dizzy&quot; Dean Davidson of Britny Fox, Lorraine Lewis of Femme Fatale, and Anthrax&#x27;s Charlie Benante played against each other in season three.
* Former child stars Brandon Cruz, Butch Patrick, and Danny Bonaduce played in season three.
* Former &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; actors Barry Williams, Eve Plumb, and Susan Olsen played in the first aired episode of the syndicated run. This episode led to a writing partnership between Williams and &quot;Remote Control&quot; head writer Chris Kreski, who co-authored the best-selling &quot;Growing Up Brady&quot; biography.
* The Red Hot Chili Peppers were contestants in the final MTV season.
* Kathy Orr, former Chief Meteorologist for KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and now an evening meteorologist with crosstown WTXF, appeared on the show as a regular contestant.
* ESPN anchor John Buccigross appeared on the show as a regular contestant.

==International versions==
* A Puerto Rican version entitled &quot;Control Remoto&quot;, hosted by former Menudo member Xavier Serbiá, was canceled after 3 months on WAPA-TV in 1989 because MTV threatened a lawsuit for copyright infringement.
* A British version of the show was co-produced by Action Time Productions and Granada Television and aired on Channel 4 from 1991 to 1992. It was hosted by Anthony H. Wilson and featured comedians Phil Cornwell and John Thomson plus keyboardist Yolisa Pharle, with guest appearances by the characters Frank Sidebottom, Sister Mary Immaculate and Mrs Merton (both played by Caroline Aherne), plus Brenda Gilhooly as a &#x27;yoof&#x27; TV presenter.
* An Australian version aired on Network Ten in 1989 under the name &quot;The Great TV Game Show&quot;. It was hosted by Russell Stubbs with Jane Holmes and the regular panelists were Russell Fletcher, Margie Nunn, Linda Gibson, and Michael Blair. The show failed to see out the year along with a number of Network Ten game shows that were launched at around the same time.
* The Italian version of the show was called &quot;Urka!&quot;, which was hosted by Paolo Bonolis and aired on Italia 1 only in 1991.
* A Brazilian version of the show called &quot;Controle Remoto&quot;, hosted by Fausto Silva aired on Rede Globo in 1989.

==Merchandise==
* A board game based on the show was released by Pressman in 1989.
* In 1989, a video game based on &quot;Remote Control&quot; was licensed for multiple platforms, including the Apple II, Commodore 64, and Nintendo Entertainment System, the latter of which was released in 1990. The video games were published by Hi Tech Expressions. The game remained quite similar to the show. The NES version omitted the final round, replacing it with a &quot;Think Real Fast&quot; round between the top two contestants.
* 1990 also saw a DOS version released; like the NES version, it has no endgame. In the DOS game, the contestant in last place is eliminated when the TV goes &quot;Off the Air&quot; in the middle of the second round instead of at the end. The other two contestants then complete the round, and then play a &quot;Think Real Fast&quot; round.

<doc id="450993" wikidata="Q7226501" url="?curid=450993" title="His-tag">
<text>A polyhistidine-tag, best known by the trademarked name His-tag, is an amino acid motif in proteins that typically consists of at least six histidine (&quot;His&quot;) residues, often at the N- or C-terminus of the protein. It is also known as a hexa histidine-tag, 6xHis-tag, or His6 tag. The tag was invented by Roche, although the use of histidines and its vectors are distributed by Qiagen. Various purification kits for histidine-tagged proteins are commercially available from multiple companies.

The total number of histidine residues may vary in the tag from as low as two, to as high as 10 or more His residues. N- or C-terminal His-tags may also be followed or preceded, respectively, by a suitable amino acid sequence that facilitates removal of the polyhistidine-tag using endopeptidases. This extra sequence is not necessary if exopeptidases are used to remove N-terminal His-tags (e.g., Qiagen TAGZyme). Furthermore, exopeptidase cleavage may solve the unspecific cleavage observed when using endoprotease-based tag removal. Polyhistidine-tags are often used for affinity purification of genetically modified proteins.

== Principle ==

Proteins can coordinate metal ions on their surface and it is possible to separate proteins using chromatography by making use of the difference in their affinity to metal ions. This is termed as immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), as originally introduced in 1975 under the name metal chelate affinity chromatography. Subsequent studies have revealed that among amino acids constituting proteins, histidine is strongly involved in the coordination complex with metal ions. Therefore, if a number of histidines are added to the end of the protein, the affinity of the protein for the metal ion is increased and this can be exploited to selectively isolate the protein of interest. When a protein with a His-tag is brought into contact with a carrier on which a metal ion such as nickel is immobilized, the histidine residue chelates the metal ion and binds to the carrier. Since other proteins do not bind to the carrier or bind only very weakly, they can be removed by washing the carrier with an appropriate buffer. The poly-histidine tagged protein can then be recovered by eluting it off the resin.

=== Practical choices ===

==== Tag length ====

Polyhistidine tags most commonly consist of six histidine residues. Tags with up to twelve histidine residues or dual tags attached via short linker are not uncommon though and may improve purification results by enhancing binding to the affinity resin, allowing for increased stringency of washing and separation from endogenous proteins. The tag can be added to a gene of interest using methods common to most purification tags. The most basic method is to subclone the gene of interest into a vector containing a polyhistidine tag sequence. Many vectors for use with various expression systems are available with polyhistidine tags in a variety of positions and with differing protease cleavage sites, other tags &quot;etc&quot;. However, if an appropriate vector is unavailable or the tag needs to be inserted at a location other than the proteins N- or C-terminus, the gene of interest can be either directly synthesised containing a polyhistidine tag sequence or various methods based on PCR can be used to add the tag to a gene. A common approach is to add the coding sequence for the polyhistidine tag to the PCR primers as an overhang.

==== Tag position ====
Most commonly, a polyhistidine tag is fused at the N-terminus or C-terminus of a protein and is attached via a short flexible linker, which may contain a protease cleavage site. Less commonly, tags can be added at both the N- and C-termini or inserted at an intermediate part of a protein, such as within an exposed loop. The choice of tag position depends on the properties of each protein and the chosen purification strategy; it may be necessary to test multiple constructs with the tag at different positions. Although polyhistidine tags are considered to typically not alter the properties of a protein, it has been demonstrated that addition of the tag can cause unwanted effects, such as influencing the protein&#x27;s oligomeric state.

==== Carrier matrices ====
Various carrier matrices bound to a solid resin support are on the market and these can be subsequently charged with a metal cation. Derivatives of iminodiacetic acid (IDA) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) are most frequently used for this purpose, with differing matrices having certain advantages and disadvantages for various applications.

==== Metal ions ====
Several metal cations have high affinities for imidazole, the functional group of the His-tag. Divalent cation M2+ (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn &quot;etc&quot;) transition metal imidazole complexes are most frequently used for this purpose. The choice of cation is generally a compromise between binding capacity and purity. Nickel is often used as it offers a good balance between these factors, while cobalt can be used when it is desired to increase the purity of purification as it has less affinity for endogenous proteins; binding capacity however is lower compared with nickel.

==== Elution method ====
In order to elute His-tagged protein from the carrier there are several potential methods, which can be used in combination if necessary. In order to avoid denaturation of proteins, it is generally desirable to use as mild a method as possible.

* Competition with analogs

For releasing the His-tagged protein from the carrier, a compound is used that has a structure similar to the His-tag and which also forms a coordination complex with the immobilized metal ions. Such a compound added to the His-tagged protein on the carrier competes with the protein for the immobilized metal ions. The compound added at high concentration replaces virtually all carrier-bound protein which is thus eluted from the carrier. Imidazole is the side chain of histidine and is typically used at a concentration of 150 - 500 mM for elution. Histidine or histamine can also be used.

* Decrease in pH

When the pH decreases, the histidine residue is protonated and can no longer coordinate the metal tag, allowing the protein to be eluted. When nickel is used as the metal ion, it is eluted at around pH 4 and cobalt at around pH 6.

* Removal of metal ions

When a strong chelating agent such as EDTA is added, the protein is detached from the carrier because the metal ion immobilized on the carrier is lost.

== Applications ==

=== Protein purification ===
Polyhistidine-tags are often used for affinity purification of polyhistidine-tagged recombinant proteins expressed in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; or other expression systems. Typically, cells are harvested via centrifugation and the resulting cell pellet lysed either by physical means or by means of detergents and enzymes such as lysozyme or any combination of these. At this stage, the lysate contains the recombinant protein among many endogenous proteins originating from the host cells. The lysate is exposed to affinity resin bound to a carrier matrix coupled with a divalent cation, either by direct addition of resin (batch binding) or by passing over a resin bed in a column format. The resin is then washed with buffer to remove proteins that do not specifically interact with bound cation and the protein of interest is eluted off the resin using buffer containing a high concentration of imidazole or a lowered pH. The purity and amount of protein can be assessed by methods such SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

Affinity purification using a polyhistidine-tag usually results in relatively pure protein. Protein purity can be improved by the addition of a low (20-40 mM) concentration of imidazole to the binding and/or wash buffers. However, depending on the requirements of the downstream application, further purification steps using methods such as ion exchange or size exclusion chromatography may be required. IMAC resins typically retain several prominent endogenous proteins as impurities. In &quot;E. coli&quot; for instance, a prominent example is FKBP-type peptidyl prolyl isomerase, which appears around 25 kDa on SDS-PAGE. These impurities can be eliminated using additional purification steps or by expressing the recombinant protein in a deficient strain of cells. Alternatively, cobalt charged IMAC resins which have less affinity for endogenous proteins can be used.

===Binding assays===
Polyhistidine-tagging can be used to detect protein-protein interactions in the same way as a pull-down assay. Polyhistidine tagging has several advantages over other tags commonly used for pull-down assays, including its small size, few naturally occurring proteins binding to the carrier matrices and the increased stability of the carrier matrix over monoclonal antibody matrices.

===Fluorescent tags===
Hexahistadine CyDye tags have been developed, which use nickel covalent coordination to EDTA groups attached to fluorophores in order to create dyes that attach to the polyhistidine tag. This technique has been shown to be useful for following protein migration and trafficking and may be effective for measuring distance via Förster resonance energy transfer.

=== Fluorohistidine tags ===
A polyfluorohistidine tag has been reported for use in &quot;in vitro&quot; translation systems. In this system, an expanded genetic code is used in which histidine is replaced by 4-fluorohistidine. The fluorinated analog is incorporated into peptides via the relaxed substrate specificity of histidine-tRNA ligase and lowers the overall pKa of the tag. This allows for the selective enrichment of polyfluorohistidine tagged peptides in the presence of complex mixtures of traditional polyhistidine tags by altering the pH of the wash buffers.

== Detection ==
The polyhistidine-tag can also be used for detecting a protein via anti-polyhistidine-tag antibodies, which can be useful for subcellular localization, ELISA, western blotting and other immuno-analytical methods. Alternatively, in-gel staining of SDS-PAGE or native-PAGE gels with fluorescent probes bearing metal ions can be used for detection of a polyhistidine tagged protein.

== Similar tags ==

=== HQ tag ===
The HQ tag has alternating histidine and glutamine (HQHQHQ).

=== HN tag ===
The HN tag has alternating histidine and asparagine (HNHNHNHNHNHN) and is more likely to be presented on the protein surface than Histidine-only tags. The HN tag binds to the immobilized metal ion more efficiently than the His tag.

=== HAT tag ===
The HAT tag is a peptide tag (KDHLIHNVHKEEHAHAHNK) derived from chicken lactate dehydrogenase, and is more likely to be a soluble protein with no bias in charge distribution compared to the His tag. The arrangement of histidines in the HAT tag allows high accessibility compared to the His tag, and it binds efficiently to the immobilized metal ion.

<doc id="450996" wikidata="Q5146531" url="?curid=450996" title="College Republicans">
<text>College Republicans is an umbrella term that describes college and university students who support the Republican Party of the United States. The College Republican National Committee (CRNC) is the oldest campus-based organization for Republican students and was founded in 1892. It currently represents 250,000 students on over 2,000 campuses. The Republican Party does not officially affiliate with any college groups, although Republican Party members often benefit from college students&#x27; campaign efforts on their behalf. Campus chapters may function independently, may be part of a statewide organization, or may be affiliated with a national alliance such as CRNC. The various campus-based Republican clubs function as recruitment organizations for the Republican Party and have produced many prominent Republican and conservative activists.

==Notable organizations==

Notable national college Republican organizations include:

* College Republican National Committee (CRNC)
* National Federation of College Republicans
* College Republicans of America 
* College Republicans United

==Governance of national organizations==

===College Republican National Committee (CRNC)===
The College Republican National Committee (CRNC), has historically been the main national College Republicans organization. Founded in 1892, it remains the largest and most active College Republicans organization with over 250,000 members on 2,000 campuses across the United States. The CRNC National Chairwoman and the national leadership team, including an executive director, political director, finance director, comptroller, national field director, treasurer, national secretary, and 4 regional vice-chairs, are elected at the bi-annual College Republican Convention. The current CRNC National Chairwoman is Courtney Britt.

In recent years, the CRNC has lost many of its state affiliates and chapters.

Following RNC Chairman Michael Whatley&#x27;s dissolution of the RNC &quot;Youth Advisory Board,&quot; the CRNC lost its 132-year long endorsement by the RNC.

=== College Republicans United (CRU) ===
The College Republicans United (CRU) was established in 2018 to oppose what was seen as a CRNC that was hostile to President Donald Trump. It consists of various college chapters in Arizona and Iowa. The leadership structure and bylaws of the organization are not made public. The CRU have been criticized for chapters which allegedly posted &quot;anti-Semitic&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; postings online, causing rifts between the CRU and other CR organizations and donors, and has been described as &quot;far-right&quot;. The CRU drew further outrage after inviting Nick Fuentes, a noted &quot;white nationalist,&quot; to their National Convention event. The group previously invited another white nationalist, Jared Taylor, to speak at a campus event. On 2025-01-31, CRU set up a table at Arizona State University&#x27;s Tempe campus, &quot;to urge students to report their peers for deportation to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&quot; The CRU is currently the smallest federation by state and chapter count, containing 5 collegiate chapters.

=== National Federation of College Republicans (NFCR) ===
The National Federation of College Republicans was created in 2022 in response to controversies arising in the CRNC. The NFCR claims to encompass 22 state federations (including but not limited to Michigan, Georgia, and Maryland). The NFCR Leadership positions consist of a Chairperson, a National Vice Chairperson, an executive director, a treasurer, a secretary, and a Parliamentarian. Rachel Howard is the current National Chairwoman of the NFCR.

=== College Republicans of America (CRA) ===
The College Republicans of America (CRA) was established in 2023 and encompasses sixteen federations (Arizona, California, Kansas, Idaho, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Missouri, Utah, Washington D.C., and Wisconsin); a plurality of clubs in Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and West Virginia; and a few clubs in several additional states. The CRA has 150 active, affiliated College Republicans chapters.

According to the CRA website, its members broke away from the CRNC due to it falling &quot;into disrepair.&quot; The CRA President and the national committee consist of an appointed president, appointed vice-presidents, appointed directors, and annually elected regional representatives. The CRA also has a Board of Governors which consist of one National Committeeman per state, elected or appointed by that state (so long as they are &quot;in good standing&quot;) via however the state sees fit. The acting CRA President is Gabriel Guidarini.

The CRA endorsed Donald Trump for president during the 2024 United States presidential election and campaigned for him during the 2024 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses. Then-CRA President, Gabriel Guidarini, delivered the pledge of allegiance at the 2024 Republican National Convention.

The group has ties to Turning Point Action (TPA), with the COO of TPA serving on the CRA&#x27;s advisory board.

== Governance of state organizations ==

===State federations===
There are upwards of 40 College Republican state federations. Each federation administers the College Republican activities at the state level. The state federation leadership team, which includes a state chairperson and other officers, serve as the primary link between local university chapters and the national federation. The state chairman serves as the representative for College Republicans when dealing with the state Republican Party, local media, and governmental entities. State federations are responsible for organizing and assisting local chapters with securing proper credentials, recruitment efforts, and campus voter canvasses. It is a state federation&#x27;s responsibility to organize and implement activities for statewide campaigns. Like the national organization, state federations operate as non-profit associations that are not legally affiliated with the Republican Party.

===Campus chapters===
The college and university-based chapters of College Republicans operate in a dual capacity as student clubs associated with a particular campus and as members of their state federation. Like the state federations and national committees, the campus chapters are affiliated with their local Republican Party, but are not official arms of that organization. The chapter chairperson and leadership team are responsible for maintaining the campus club&#x27;s credentials and constitution, and representing the College Republicans when dealing with university administration, other student groups, and in the surrounding community. The campus chapter leadership team might include many members, with administrative responsibilities delegated to dormitory and Greek chapter chairpersons.

==Activities==
During election season, campus chapters are responsible for organizing and implementing the campus canvas, running mock elections, managing the local get-out-the-vote efforts. At other times, the campus chapters will organize issue advocacy and lobbying efforts, welcome conservative guest speakers to campus, and organize social events and other recruitment activities.

Generally, the hired field representative or chapter chair begins the school year with membership tables on campus for recruitment. Members use door-to-door canvassing and word of mouth to identify and register as many Republican voters among the student body as possible. These individuals are encouraged to vote through an absentee ballot and assist the candidates with election day Get Out The Vote efforts. Chapters occasionally run student mock elections and other special events as a means to gain positive earned media attention for a candidate.

<doc id="450997" wikidata="Q513712" url="?curid=450997" title="Pony Canyon">
<text>, also known by the shorthand form , is a Japanese company, established on October 1, 1966, which distributes music, films, home video, and video games. It is affiliated with the Japanese media group Fujisankei Communications Group. Pony Canyon is a major leader in the music industry in Japan, with its artists regularly at the top of the Japanese charts. Pony Canyon is also responsible for releasing taped concerts from its artists as well as many anime productions and several film productions.

Pony Canyon is headquartered in Tokyo with offices in Taiwan and South Korea. It employs approximately 360 people. Pony Canyon also owns the recording label Flight Master.

== History ==
On October 1, 1966, Nippon Broadcasting System, Inc. established a new record label division, called as Nippon Broadcasting System Service, Inc., in order to produce and market music from Japanese artists. The division formally changed its name in 1970 to Pony Inc. in order to match the brand names it had been using previously. These were &quot;PONYPak&quot; for 8-track cartridges from 1967, and &quot;PONY&quot; for cassettes from 1968.

On August 1, 1970, another Japanese record label, Canyon Records Inc. was founded. Like Pony Inc., Canyon Records was part of the Fujisankei Communications Group. Canyon Records was financially backed at 60% by Pony Inc. and at 40% by Pony&#x27;s parent company Nippon Broadcasting System.

In 1982, Pony ventured into interactive content by producing personal computer game software under the name &quot;Ponyca&quot;. In 1984, the company entered license agreements with major overseas companies MGM/UA Home Video, Vestron Video International, Walt Disney Home Video and BBC Video (the company also entered a license agreement with RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video in 1986), and in 1985, they established offices in New York and London. In 1986, Pony signed licensing agreements with A&amp;M Records and in 1989 with Virgin Records to handle both companies&#x27; Japanese CD releases.

On October 21, 1987, Pony Inc. and Canyon Records merged their operations to form Pony Canyon Inc.

In 1990, Pony Canyon branched out, and opened five subsidiaries outside Japan, mainly in East Asian countries. It opened its Hong Kong branch first, known as Golden Pony in 1991, created through its merger with Golden Harvest. A Singaporean branch, catering to the South East Asian market, opened later, followed its South Korean branch, Sam Pony through a partnership with Sam Video. 

Pony Canyon&#x27;s subsidiary in Singapore called Skin was managed by Jimmy Wee and signed local English language performers such as Gwailo, Art Fazil, Chris Vadham, The Lizards&#x27; Convention, Humpback Oak and Radio Active. Pony Canyon has also had a subsidiary in Taiwan. 

Four of five subsidiaries were closed in 1997 due to Asian financial crisis, leaving the Malaysian subsidiary as the only subsidiary to remain in operation. However, the Hong Kong and Korean operations were reestablished as a wholly owned subsidiary, although the Korean operation had a 16% stake of local partner. In 2003, the Hong Kong and Taiwan branch of Pony Canyon, both affected by the financial crisis, were acquired by Forward Music. In 2018, Pony Canyon reestablished its branch in Taiwan.

As a video game producer, Pony Canyon brought the &quot;Ultima&quot; series from Origin Systems and the &quot;Advanced Dungeons and Dragons&quot; series from Strategic Simulations to Nintendo&#x27;s Family Computer. Between 1986 and 1990, they produced remakes of the first four &quot;Ultima&quot; titles for the MSX2 and NES platforms. These remakes differed from the original versions, with rewritten game code and all-new graphics. Pony Canyon&#x27;s video game library was generally released in North America by FCI. Pony Canyon has not released any video games since &quot;Virtual View: Nemoto Harumi&quot; for the PlayStation 2 in July 2003.

The company has occasionally been involved in film production. For example, they were a co-production company for the 1996 Indian erotic film &quot;Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love&quot;.

Following a merger with Nippon Broadcasting System, Fuji Television Network, Inc. became the major shareholder of Pony Canyon in 2006. The following year, Fuji Television made Pony Canyon its wholly owned subsidiary. Fuji Television was subsequently renamed Fuji Media Holdings in 2008. Despite associations with Fuji Television, not all of Pony Canyon&#x27;s TV show and movie library has been broadcast on Fuji Television. Some of Pony Canyon&#x27;s non-Fuji TV catalog includes &quot;Doraemon&quot; movies.

In September 2014, Pony Canyon opened a North American anime distribution label, Ponycan USA, which aims to license their titles for streaming and home video in US and Canada. Their home video releases will be distributed exclusively by Right Stuf Inc.

<text>Rabid is a 1977 independent body horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg. An international co-production of Canada and the United States, the film stars Marilyn Chambers in the lead role, supported by Frank Moore, Joe Silver, and Howard Ryshpan. Chambers plays a woman who, after being injured in a motorcycle accident and undergoing a surgical operation, develops an orifice under one of her armpits that hides a phallic/clitoral stinger she uses to feed on people&#x27;s blood. Those she bites become infected, and then feed upon others, spreading the disease exponentially. The result is massive chaos, starting in the Quebec countryside, and ending up in Montreal. &quot;Rabid&quot; made $1 million in Canada, making it one of the highest-grossing Canadian films of all time. A remake of the same name, directed by Jen and Sylvia Soska, was released in 2019.

==Plot==
Rose Miller and her boyfriend, Hart Reed, are involved in a motorcycle accident in the Quebec countryside after encountering a van in the middle of the road. Hart suffers a broken hand, a separated shoulder and a concussion, while Rose is severely injured and burned. They are taken to the Keloid Clinic for Plastic Surgery, where Dr. Dan Keloid performs an experimental procedure on Rose, using morphogenetically neutral grafts to replace her damaged skin and organs. Hart is released after a month, but Rose remains in a coma.

Rose suddenly awakens one night screaming and pierces fellow patient Lloyd Walsh&#x27;s skin. The doctors are puzzled as Lloyd has no memory of the incident and his blood fails to clot. Unknown to them, Rose&#x27;s procedure has caused her to mutate, allowing her to survive only on human blood. A red stinger-like organ emerges under her armpit, which she uses to feed on her victims. One night, Rose leaves the clinic and attempts to feed on a cow but becomes sick. A farmer attacks her, but she retaliates by feeding on him and then calls Hart to pick her up. The next day, the farmer transforms into a zombie-like creature and attacks a waitress at a roadside diner. Meanwhile, Lloyd leaves the clinic but, during a taxi ride, begins foaming at the mouth and attacks the driver, resulting in a fatal crash.

At the clinic, Dr. Keloid becomes infected by Rose&#x27;s stinger, causing chaos as he attacks a nurse during an operation. Rose escapes and hitchhikes to Montreal, where she infects a truck driver. Hart, along with Dr. Keloid&#x27;s business partner Murray Cypher, teams up with police chief Claude LePointe and public health officials to discuss the escalating epidemic. Hart witnesses an infected police officer before the officer is shot. He calls Rose&#x27;s friend, Mindy, and asks her to keep Rose at her apartment if she shows up. Rose arrives in Montreal and stays with Mindy. While Mindy watches a news broadcast about a rabies-like epidemic spreading in the city, Rose goes to an adult movie theater and infects a patron. Later, Mindy encounters an infected woman attacking passengers on the subway. Meanwhile, LePointe and his team are attacked by infected workmen. With the outbreak worsening and rabies treatments failing, Dr. Royce Gentry advises a shoot-to-kill policy to prevent further infections. Martial law is declared and the Canadian Army sets up roadblocks, while NBC-suited soldiers help dispose of bodies.

Murray and Hart arrive at Murray&#x27;s home, where Murray finds his baby dead and is attacked by his infected wife. Hart drives into the abandoned city to search for Rose. An infected person jumps onto his car but is shot by soldiers, who disinfect Hart&#x27;s vehicle before allowing him to continue. Mindy watches a news report indicating the infection may have originated at the Keloid Clinic. Rose returns to Mindy&#x27;s apartment and feeds on her. Hart finds Rose in the act and pleads with her to seek treatment, but she denies responsibility for the epidemic. Rose infects a man in the apartment lobby and locks herself in a room with him, planning to test whether he becomes infected. As Hart desperately tries to convince her to leave, the man turns rabid and attacks Rose. The next morning, Rose&#x27;s body is found in an alley by NBC-suited soldiers, who dispose of her corpse in a garbage truck.

==Production==
Cinépix requested another film from David Cronenberg following the success of &quot;Shivers&quot;. Criticism from Robert Fulford about the Canadian Film Development Corporation&#x27;s funding of &quot;Shivers&quot; made it more difficult for Cronenberg to gain funding for his films. The CFDC funded the film through cross-collateralization with &quot;Convoy&quot;, which was never completed, to avoid a direct connection.

Initially titled &quot;Mosquitoes&quot; Cronenberg had difficulty writing the script due to the broader nature of the film&#x27;s city setting compared to &quot;Shivers&quot; which took place in one apartment complex. At one point he told John Dunning that &quot;John, I just woke up this morning and realized this is nuts. Do you know what this movie&#x27;s about? This woman grows a cock thing in her armpit and sucks people&#x27;s blood through it. It&#x27;s ridiculous! I can&#x27;t do this. It&#x27;s not going to work&quot;.

The film was shot from 1 November to 5 December 1976, on a budget of $530,000 (), with $200,000 coming from the CFDC. According to Cronenberg, at the time, the only CFDC films that had turned a profit were the two that he had made for the corporation, &quot;Shivers&quot; and &quot;Crimes of the Future&quot;. Cronenberg&#x27;s editing decisions to tighten and reduce the film&#x27;s runtime produced criticism such as his removal of a scene, which he regretted cutting, explaining the development of the armpit orifice.

Cronenberg wanted Sissy Spacek to play the lead character after seeing her performance in &quot;Badlands&quot;. However, Dunning rejected her citing her freckles and her Texan accent. Marilyn Chambers was suggested by Ivan Reitman. Reitman heard that Chambers was looking for a mainstream role and had existing name recognition. Cronenberg agreed to cast her, even though he had not seen her best-known movie, &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot;. Cronenberg would later say that he had been impressed by Chambers and her work ethic during the filming of &quot;Rabid&quot;. Spacek would star in the hit film &quot;Carrie&quot;; Cronenberg included a poster for that movie in the background of a scene in &quot;Rabid&quot;.

==Release==
The film was distributed by Cinépix in Canada and released on 8 April 1977, in Montreal. It was released theatrically in the United States by New World Pictures in 1977. &quot;Rabid&quot; and &quot;Shivers&quot; were re-released as a double feature in Paris in December 1994.

===Box office===
&quot;Rabid&quot; grossed $100,000 in the first ten days after opening in Montreal. The film was one of the highest-grossing Canadian films of all time, making $1 million in Canada.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Rabid&quot; &quot;an extremely violent, sometimes nauseating, picture&quot;. Les Wedman of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; described the movie&#x27;s story as &quot;dreadful&quot; and criticized the film for &quot;relying heavily on shocking special effects&quot; as opposed to suspense. He opined that, with the exception of Joe Silver, &quot;there isn&#x27;t a decent performance in the movie.&quot; Martin Malina, who reviewed the film alongside similar films &quot;Demon Seed&quot; and &quot;Audrey Rose&quot; in the same column of the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;, said that it &quot;has some genuinely frightening moments but they are few, and the story progresses in fits and starts. The dialogue is witless, the exposition awkward, and the film spends far too much time travelling in cars between one gory scene and another.&quot;. Clyde Gilmour of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; noted of the film&#x27;s box office success, but stated that he was &quot;not sure what this proves, except possibly that Canadians, when they really try, can make nauseating movies as efficiently as Americans.&quot;

Conversely, &quot;Time Out&quot; called the film &quot;far better staged&quot; than &quot;Shivers&quot;, and concluded, &quot;None of the other recent apocalypse movies has shown so much political or cinematic sophistication.&quot;

Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 78% of 27 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.3/10.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released &quot;Rabid&quot; on VHS in 1983. In 2000, it was released on DVD by New Concorde Home Entertainment. E1 Entertainment put out a Special Edition DVD in 2004. The film was rereleased on DVD and Blu-ray for Region B by Arrow Video on February 16, 2015. Scream Factory released the movie on Blu-ray on November 22, 2016.

==Remake==

A remake of the film, directed by Jen and Sylvia Soska and starring Laura Vandervoort as Rose, was released on December 13, 2019.

==Related works==
A novelization by Richard Lewis was published in 1978. Faber and Faber released the screenplay in 2002 in a collection of the scripts for Cronenberg&#x27;s first four feature films.

<text>Susan Janet Watts (born 13 July 1962) is a science journalist. She was science editor of the BBC&#x27;s Newsnight programme, from January 1995 to November 2013.

==Education==
Watts was educated at Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham Girls&#x27; School. She has a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Imperial College London and a Diploma in Journalism from City University London

==Career==
Watts spent ten years in print journalism specialising in scientific topics. She worked for &quot;Computer Weekly&quot; from 1985 to 1989, &quot;New Scientist&quot; from 1989 to 1991 and &quot;The Independent&quot; from 1991 to 1995, before moving into television. She won a BAFTA for her reporting of the BSE &quot;Mad Cow&quot; crisis in British farming. In 2013 she was made redundant from &quot;Newsnight&quot; when incoming editor Ian Katz decided that the programme no longer required a dedicated science editor.

In 2015 Watts became Head of Public Engagement and Communications at the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Imperial College London.

==Hutton Tribunal==
Watts came into the limelight in Summer 2003 during the Hutton Inquiry, a judicial inquiry into the death of Biological Weapons expert David Kelly. Kelly had died by suicide after his exposure as the source for a controversial report by fellow BBC journalist Andrew Gilligan, in which it was claimed that the British government had deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by Iraq&#x27;s Weapons of Mass Destruction in order to justify a war.

On 2 June 2003, Susan Watts broadcast a report in which she extensively quoted a &quot;senior official involved with the process of pulling together the original September 2002 Blair weapons dossier&quot;. Her source was Dr Kelly. The thrust of the report was similar to the later Gilligan story, but the key allegations in Watts&#x27;s report were described in more measured terms and without Gilligan&#x27;s claim of the direct personal involvement of Alastair Campbell in rewriting the dossier.

Like Gilligan, Watts had spoken to Kelly on an unattributable basis but, unlike Gilligan, she had kept detailed verbatim notes of her conversations, and in one case a tape recording. Watts&#x27;s notes and recording showed that Kelly had made remarks very similar to those attributed to him by Gilligan; her shorthand notes read:

&quot;A mistake to put it in, Alastair Campbell seeing something in there, single source but not corroborated, sounded good.&quot;

She had felt under &quot;considerable internal pressure&quot; to back her employers, despite her own misgivings and as a result she was represented by independent counsel at the Hutton Inquiry. There she told Lord Hutton that she regarded Kelly&#x27;s remarks about the involvement of Campbell in the strengthening of claims in the dossier as no more than a &quot;glib statement&quot; and a &quot;gossipy aside&quot; for which Kelly had no evidence. Gilligan had decided to make more of similar remarks drawn from his memory of his conversations with Dr Kelly.

<doc id="451011" wikidata="Q4833644" url="?curid=451011" title="B-17, Queen of the Skies">
<text>B-17, Queen of the Skies is a solitaire board wargame published by On Target Games in 1981 that simulates flight missions in a Boeing B-17F Flying Fortress bomber during World War II. The game was acquired by Avalon Hill and republished in 1983.

==Background==
In late 1942 and early 1943, before the advent of long-range fighter escorts such as the P-51 Mustang, B-17 bombers of the Eighth Air Force had to defend themselves from fierce German fighter attacks as they undertook long missions over northern Europe. Even flying in close formation for mutual protection and more concentrated bombing patterns, the threats of flak, bad weather and determined Luftwaffe attacks resulted in a low percentage of the bombs hitting the target, and a loss of many bombers.

==Description==
&quot;B-17&quot; is a solitaire board wargame in which the player controls a B-17 bomber on missions over Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands between November 1942 and May 1943. Mission targets, opposition fighters and flak are all determined randomly, as is damage done to the B-17. The player&#x27;s role in the game is to allocate defensive fire from the multiple weapons positions on the bomber.

===Components===
The game features several boards: the game board, the strategic map of northern Europe, and the crew placement board. Other components include various tables and charts, 88 counters, 16 German fighter cards and a pad of mission charts.

===Gameplay===
The bomber board shows a plan layout of the aircraft. The player places the ten crew counters in the appropriate locations at the beginning of a mission. As enemy fighters attack, the player keeps track of damage to the plane and the crew, which can eliminate crew members and their commensurate abilities, reduce the efficiency of several systems, disable gun turrets, or even result in a cataclysmic explosion.

The strategic map is broken into zones. As the aircraft enters a new zone, the player rolls dice to determine what the bomber faces.

The game comes with 25 missions, which start at a relatively easy level, with short missions that include a fighter escort during the entire mission, and build up to very long and difficult missions with no fighter cover. The objective of the game is to complete all 25 missions with the same bomber and crew.

The rules also cover bail-outs, leaving the bomber formation, replacing a dead gunner with another crew member, forced landings on land and water, and variable enemy fighter attacks.

There are rules for a two-player game, where one player controls the bomber, and the other player controls the German air defenses.

Several variant aircraft were published in Avalon Hill&#x27;s magazine &quot;The General&quot;, including the late-model Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress, the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, the RAF&#x27;s Avro Lancaster and late-war Luftwaffe aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 262 and Me 163 jet aircraft.

==Publication history==
In 1981, Glen Frank developed a solitaire bombing game titled &quot;B-17, Queen of the Skies&quot;, which was published by On Target Games. Two years later, Avalon Hill bought the game, and Bruce Shelley did some minor modifications to a few rules. Avalon Hill published the game in 1983 with new cover art and a new map by Joe DeMarco.

==Reception==
In Issue 17 of &quot;Imagine&quot; (August 1984), Don Turnbull liked the quality of components. He noted that although the game &quot;relies on a host of charts, tables and die rolls to simulate the &#x27;other side&#x27; and this can make a solitaire game mechanically rather a drudge; fortunately this is not the case here since, once the mechanics are understood, the game flows very well.&quot; He also pointed out that &quot;solitaire players have no opponent to remind them of various stages in the procedure which they have, wittingly or otherwise, overlooked. The game might therefore become rather easier than intended if you forget to perform one of your opponent&#x27;s activities from time to time.&quot; Turnbull suggested a check sheet would be useful to avoid this. He found &quot;The mechanics are simple and relatively uncluttered, consistent with the need for solitaire play and, though there are a few so-called optional rules, they are neither particularly complex nor particularly long-winded.&quot; Turnbull concluded, &quot;I can recommend this for a casual and not too serious diversion from more stressful games.&quot;

In Issue 30 of &quot;Fire &amp; Movement&quot;, Ron Jongeling called the On Target edition &quot;the solitaire player&#x27;s dream come true. The price is steep, considering the small amount of components, but what the game lacks in physical content, it more than makes up for in enjoyment.&quot; He concluded, &quot;In the 100+ missions I have flown so far, not one error and not one little glitch has surfaced from the rules.&quot;

In Issue 72 of &quot;Fire &amp; Movement&quot;, Chris Perleberg reviewed the Avalon Hill edition and noted, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of dice rolling, and there aren&#x27;t a lot of decisions to be made by the player. Still, the game is habit forming, probably because you can make specific statements about it: &#x27;Yeah, I took a flak hit over Antwerp that wounded my starboard waist gunner and knocked out my port inboard engine, so I had to ditch in France.&#x27; It feels real.&quot;

In a retrospective article in Issue 5 of &quot;Simulacrum&quot;, Joe Scoleri noted that differences in the rules between the On Target edition and the Avalon Hill edition were minimal, but conceded that &quot;On Target&#x27;s component quality is considerably lower.&quot; However, he liked On Target&#x27;s counters better, which featured small illustrations, rather than the text-only counters in the Avalon Hill edition. He also noted that although Avalon Hill made improvements to the Attack Board and strategic map, &quot;The biggest surprise is that [On Target&#x27;s] superb artwork for the German aircraft cards was not an AH contribution. The illustrations descended virtually unchanged from the On Target edition!&quot;

<text>The Banat Military Frontier or simply Banat Frontier (; ; ) was a district of the Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s Military Frontier during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was located in southern parts of the Banat region. It was formed in 1764, out of territories of the Banat of Temeswar. Today, the territory is split between Serbia and Romania.

==Geography==

The Frontier was divided into Serb (&quot;Illyrian&quot;), German (&quot;Danube Swabian&quot;) and Romanian (&quot;Vlach&quot;) sections. It included parts of modern-day Banat and the south-eastern part of Bačka region, known as Šajkaška. Some of the important cities and places were: Pančevo, Bela Crkva, Titel, Žabalj, Alibunar, Kovin, and Caransebeş.

==History==

The military province of Habsburg monarchy known as the Banat of Temeswar was created in 1718. In 1751, Maria Theresa introduced a civil administration for the northern part of the province. The southern part remained under military administration and was organized as the Banat Military Frontier. In 1849, this part of the Military Frontier bordered the Principality of Serbia to the south, Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar to the north, Transylvania and Wallachia to the east, and the Slavonian Military Frontier to the west. It remained a part of the Habsburg Military Frontier until it was abolished in 1871.

<text>Soundtrack Pro is a discontinued music composing and audio editing application made by Apple Inc. It included a collection of just over 5,000 royalty free professional instrument loops and sound effects for use. The software was featured in the Logic Studio and Final Cut Studio software bundles; It was discontinued with the release of Final Cut Pro X, Motion 5, and Compressor 4.

==History==
An earlier incarnation of the package, Soundtrack, was first sold as part of Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro 4 video editor, released in April 2003. It was then released as a stand-alone product, but due to low demand it was discontinued. The main concept of Soundtrack was to allow people who are not professional composers to produce original music for their videos or DVDs, royalty-free. The music could be easily scored to QuickTime movies and Final Cut Pro projects. Soundtrack was reinstated in January 2005 as part of Final Cut Express HD.

Also see a release history in context with the rest of Final Cut Studio.
===Version 1===
Soundtrack &quot;Pro&quot; was introduced on April 17, 2005 as a stand-alone product and as part of the Final Cut Studio suite, where it integrates with Final Cut Pro. Soundtrack (non-Pro) was removed from Final Cut Pro. There was also an upgrade package for users of Soundtrack. As of January 10, 2006, the stand-alone product has been dropped again. Soundtrack Pro adds features for professional audio engineers and sound designers, and focuses more on sound editing than the original Soundtrack.

Since September 2007 Soundtrack Pro also comes as part of the Logic Studio bundle, Apple&#x27;s own audio and midi sequencing software. But it was removed from Logic Studio when Logic Pro was moved to the App Store on December 8, 2011.

===Soundtrack Pro 2===
Soundtrack Pro 2 is included in Final Cut Studio 2 (2008).

===Soundtrack Pro 3===
Soundtrack Pro 3 is included in Final Cut Studio (2009).

==Features==
Soundtrack Pro has two main modes: multitrack mode and editing mode.

===Multitrack mode===
Multitrack mode is where the royalty-free instrument loops and sound effects can be arranged in synchronisation with the video track, and where narration or other external audio sources can be recorded. There are both single and multi-take recording features. As with all of Apple&#x27;s loop arranging software, the project&#x27;s master key and tempo can be set, and all of the loops will automatically be played at those settings, regardless of the key and tempo at which they were originally recorded. At the same time, the key and tempo for the whole project can be varied over time with the master envelopes.

Envelopes are a sequence of keyframes that can be applied to audio parameters. Each individual track has envelopes for volume and pan by default. Adding keyframes to these envelopes (effectively lines that run beneath each track) allows the parameters to be varied over time. Each track can also have filters and effects applied to it; these could be Audio Units or Logic Pro plug-ins - examples of those included are Compressor, Multipressor, Flanger, Space Designer and Ringshifter. Every parameter of these effects can also be automated (that is, changed over time).

In addition, there is a mixer interface. Using the &#x27;touch&#x27; or &#x27;latch&#x27; modes, changes to volume, pan and effects parameters can be recorded in real time as the project plays. Soundtrack Pro also supports external hardware mixers, or control surfaces.

===Audio editing mode===

The audio-editing mode is where individual clips can be edited. The waveform, as well as a frequency spectrum, can be viewed for the clip. The audio can be analyzed for common audio problems such as clicks and pops, power line hum and clipped signals, and then any discovered problems can be fixed. Audio can be faded in and out, the amplitude can be altered for a selection, noise can be removed and silence, waveforms and ambient noise can be inserted. There is also a selection history tool that cycles between previous selections. After zooming in on the individual samples in the audio waveform, the pen tool can be used to edit the wave directly. There is a time-stretch tool for changing the speed of a clip, or a part thereof.

Sound editing in the application is based on actions. The actions performed on a clip, such as reversing it, inverting it or normalizing it, are listed on the left-hand side, where they can be reviewed, disabled, reverted or re-ordered. Unchecking the check box for one action removes its effect (and the waveform changes animatedly to reflect the change). Moving the purple tag upwards cycles back through the actions history.

The program also features AppleScript automation and batch processing, for which it also provides actions for Mac OS X v10.4&#x27;s Automator application.

===Integration===
Soundtrack Pro is designed to be used in combination with Final Cut Pro, both of which are included in the Final Cut Studio box set. It supports a &#x27;roundtrip&#x27; workflow, in which Final Cut Pro sequences can be exported as small reference files that include scoring markers. These reference files are then dragged from Soundtrack Pro&#x27;s Browser tab to the video pane. The video track includes thumbnails of the video at each scoring marker (not where there were scene breaks in Final Cut). Once the soundtrack is finished, it is exported as a mix (i.e. all the tracks are flattened together) and can then be imported into Final Cut. If the soundtrack needs to be changed, the Soundtrack Pro project file can be re-opened at any time, but the changes will only show up in Final Cut when the mix has been re-exported (to the same file).

The program also allows multitrack projects to be exported directly with Compressor settings.

<doc id="451021" wikidata="Q271905" url="?curid=451021" title="Mary Rowlandson">
<text>Mary Rowlandson, née White, later Mary Talcott (c. 1637January 5, 1711), was a colonial American woman who was captured by Native Americans in 1676 during King Philip&#x27;s War and held for 11 weeks before being ransomed. In 1682, six years after her ordeal, &quot;The Sovereignty and Goodness of God: Being a Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson&quot; was published. This text is considered a formative American work in the literary genre of captivity narratives. It went through four printings in 1682 and garnered readership both in the New England colonies and in England, leading some to consider it the first American &quot;bestseller&quot;.

== Biography ==
Mary White was born 1637 in Somerset, England. Her family left England sometime before 1650, settled at Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and in 1653, moved to Lancaster, on the Massachusetts frontier. There she married Reverend Joseph Rowlandson, the son of Thomas Rowlandson of Ipswich, Massachusetts, in 1656. Mary and Joseph Rowlandson had four children between 1658 and 1669, with their first daughter dying young.
At sunrise on February 10, 1676, during King Philip&#x27;s War, Lancaster came under attack by Narragansett, Wampanoag, and Nashaway–Nipmuc groups led by Monoco. Rowlandson and her three children, Joseph, Mary, and Sarah, were among those taken in the raid.
Rowlandson&#x27;s 6-year-old daughter, Sarah, died from her wounds after a week of captivity.
For more than 11 weeks, Rowlandson and her remaining children were forced to accompany the Native Americans as they travelled through the wilderness to carry out other raids and to elude the English militia.
The conditions of their captivity are recounted in detail in Rowlandson&#x27;s captivity narrative. On May 2, 1676, Rowlandson was ransomed for £20, raised by the women of Boston in a public subscription and paid by John Hoar of Concord at Redemption Rock in Princeton, Massachusetts.

In 1677, Rowlandson moved with her family to Wethersfield, Connecticut, where her husband was installed as pastor in April of that year. He died in Wethersfield in November 1678. Church officials granted Mary a pension of £30 per year.

Mary Rowlandson and her children subsequently moved to Boston, where she is thought to have written her captivity narrative, although her original manuscript has not survived. It was published in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1682, and in London the same year. At one time scholars believed that Rowlandson had died before her narrative was published, but it was later discovered that she had lived for many more years. On August 6, 1679, she married Captain Samuel Talcott and took his surname. She died on January 5, 1711, aged approximately 73, outliving her second spouse by more than 18 years.

== &quot;The Sovereignty and Goodness of God&quot; ==
Mary Rowlandson&#x27;s autobiographical account of her kidnapping and ransom is considered a classic of the American captivity narrative genre. In it, she records how she witnessed the murder of her family and friends. Upon her capture, she traveled with her youngest child Sarah. Only six years old, Sarah died en route, near what is now the town of Hardwick, Massachusetts. Mary and her two other surviving children were kept separately and sold as property, until she was finally reunited with her husband after their ransom was paid.

Although she feared and reviled the Native Americans, Rowlandson explains that &quot;not one of them ever offered the least abuse of unchastity to me in words or action&quot;, meaning that the natives never sexually molested or violated her. Her Puritan faith helped her make sense of her kidnapping. Rowlandson was unsure how far the colonists should travel into the wilderness away from Puritan settlements.

Puritan colonists were curious about the experience of one who had lived among native people as a captive and then returned to colonial society. Many literate English people were familiar with the captivity narratives written by English and European traders and explorers during the 17th century, who were taken captive at sea off the coast of North Africa and in the Mediterranean and sometimes sold into slavery in the Middle East. (see John Smith).

&quot;A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson&quot; is among the most frequently cited examples of a captivity narrative and is often viewed as an archetypal model. Because of Rowlandson&#x27;s encounter with her Native American captors, her narrative is also interesting for its treatment of intercultural contact. Finally, in its use of autobiography, Biblical typology, and similarity to the &quot;Jeremiad&quot;, &quot;A Narrative of the Captivity&quot; offers valuable insight into the mind and lifestyle of a Puritan citizen.

===Biblical content and ministerial influences===
Scholars such as Gary Ebersole and Kathryn Derounian-Stodola have noted the similarities between Rowlandson&#x27;s narrative and the Puritan Jeremiad and have considered the editorial influence that Increase Mather might have had on the text. In fact, many scholars identify Mather as the anonymous writer of &quot;The Preface to the Reader&quot; which was originally published with the narrative. In recent scholarship, Billy J. Stratton has further elaborated on this line of thought, claiming that Mather may have had a much more extensive involvement in the book&#x27;s production than has been previously believed. Others argue that this perception is revisionist thinking based on today&#x27;s perception of the Puritan past.

Throughout the narrative of Rowlandson&#x27;s captivity, the central influence of Puritan philosophy is displayed through the use of Biblical quotations that function to reinforce her descriptions of a world of stark dichotomies: punishment and retribution, darkness and light, and good and evil. The prevalent use of scripture throughout the narrative often functioned as a source of strength and solace for Rowlandson. The lessons and meaning conveyed also acted to demonstrate her Puritan faith and belief that God&#x27;s grace and Divine providence shape the events of the world. For example, when Rowlandson did not know where her children were (or even whether they were alive), she stated, &quot;And my poor girl, I knew not where she was, not whether she was sick, or well, or alive, or dead. I repaired under these thoughts to my Bible (my great comfort in that time) and that scripture came to my hand, &#x27;Cast thy burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain thee&#x27; (Psalm 55.22).&quot;

<text>Trinity College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate liberal arts college of Duke University. Founded in 1838, it is the original school of the university. Currently, Trinity is one of five undergraduate degree programs at Duke, the others being the Edmund T. Pratt School of Engineering, Nicholas School of the Environment, School of Nursing, and Duke Kunshan University.

At Duke, Arts &amp; Sciences is the collective name of all educational programs, research programs, and faculty in the humanities, social sciences, and the natural sciences at Duke, inclusive of undergraduate programs and many degree programs in Duke&#x27;s Graduate School.

The division&#x27;s unusual dual name may reflect the fact that it is responsible for undergraduate education (through Trinity College) and graduate education and research (Arts and Sciences).

== History ==

Trinity College was the name of the predecessor of Duke University. Tobacco magnate and philanthropist James Buchanan Duke left a $24 million bequest to transform the college into a research university called &quot;Duke University&quot; in honor of his father Washington Duke. In 1930, the institution&#x27;s original Durham campus became known as the Women&#x27;s College of Duke University, while Trinity continued as the name of the undergraduate men&#x27;s college. The West or Gothic campus about a mile from East Campus became home to Trinity College, along with Duke University Hospital and the graduate and professional schools. The two colleges continued as coordinate residential and degree-granting entities for forty years. However, there was always a single faculty of Arts and Sciences responsible for undergraduate and graduate instruction. Trinity College and the Women&#x27;s College merged in 1972 to form Trinity College of Arts and Sciences and the East and West campus became co-educational.

== Organization ==
The college is a constituent school of Duke University and contains a dependent system of residential colleges. Although it is a &quot;college,&quot; its highest ranking officer is its Dean.

The interim dean of Trinity College of Arts &amp; Sciences is Mohamed Noor, previously Dean of Natural Sciences for three years. Former dean Valerie Ashby, professor of chemistry, left her second term early to become President of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County in 2022. Each dean is appointed to the position for a five-year term, and the position serves under the university&#x27;s provost and president.

Due to Duke&#x27;s interdisciplinary approach, it is common for faculty to hold cross-college appointments; however, all faculty of the college are also faculty within Duke&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

In the beginning of the twenty-first century, Duke renovated the undergraduate residential college experience. In the present day, the residential colleges are funded and controlled by the University, not by the college. Each residential college has a specific dean, headed by one residential &quot;Associate Dean.&quot; Note, these deans are not the heads of specific departments, but rather general undergraduate deans. Each department has an independent department head who oversees both the undergraduate and graduate education within the specific department.

== Residential colleges ==
All undergraduate students at Duke University live within the residential college system, regardless of if the students are enrolled in the college of Arts and Sciences or Engineering. By keeping all undergraduates, regardless of their undergraduate college affiliation, in one system allows for one integrated Duke undergraduate community.

All undergraduate freshman at Duke since the merger of the Women&#x27;s College in 1972 live on the east part of campus. After their freshman year, undergraduates have the ability to rush certain &quot;houses&quot; within the residential college system, located on the west part of campus. Although similar to the residential housing systems at Yale and Harvard, Duke&#x27;s is distinct due to the tradition of freshman and upperclassmen living on separately designated parts of campus.

== Current programs ==
At Duke, the undergraduate experience centers around Trinity College, with Engineering students taking approximately half of their Duke common curriculum within Trinity. Engineering students are able to enroll in any classes within the liberal arts college, and Trinity students are able to enroll in any classes within the engineering college.

The Duke undergraduate curriculum includes a focus on the humanities. All freshman students take a writing class and a current-issues seminar class.

The Graduate School trains roughly 1200 doctoral and masters students in the arts and sciences as well as in divinity, engineering, business, and environmental and earth sciences.

** Biophysics
** Chemistry
** Computational Biology &amp; Bioinformatics

<doc id="451023" wikidata="Q389911" url="?curid=451023" title="The Brood">
<text>The Brood is a 1979 Canadian psychological body horror film written and directed by David Cronenberg and starring Oliver Reed, Samantha Eggar, and Art Hindle. Its plot follows a man and his mentally ill ex-wife, who has been sequestered by a psychiatrist known for his controversial therapy techniques. A series of brutal unsolved murders serves as the backdrop for the central narrative.

Written by Cronenberg after his own acrimonious divorce, he intended the screenplay as a meditation on a fractured relationship between a husband and wife who share a child, and cast Eggar and Hindle as loose facsimiles of himself and his ex-wife. He would later state that, despite its incorporation of science fiction elements, he considered it his sole feature that most embodied a &quot;classic horror film&quot;. Principal photography of &quot;The Brood&quot; took place in late 1978 in Toronto on a budget of $1.5 million. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Howard Shore, in his film composing debut.

Released in the spring of 1979 by New World Pictures, &quot;The Brood&quot; proved profitable for the studio, grossing over $5 million. Though it initially received mixed reviews from critics, it would establish itself as a cult film in the following decades. It has attracted scholarly interest from academics in the areas of film theory for its themes regarding mental illness and parenthood. In 2006, the Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 88th scariest film of all time. In 2013, it was selected for restoration by the Criterion Collection, which subsequently released it on Blu-ray.

==Plot==
Dr. Hal Raglan, a psychotherapist, encourages patients with mental disturbances to let go of their suppressed emotions through physiological changes to their bodies in a technique he calls &quot;psychoplasmics&quot;. One of his patients is Nola Carveth, a severely disturbed woman who is legally embattled with her husband Frank for custody of their five-year-old daughter Candice. When Frank discovers bruises and scratches on Candice following a visit with Nola, he informs Raglan of his intent to stop visitation rights. Wanting to protect his patient, Raglan begins to intensify the sessions with Nola to resolve the issue quickly. During the therapy sessions, he discovers that Nola was physically and verbally abused by her alcoholic mother, Juliana, while neglected by her co-dependent alcoholic father, Barton, who refused to protect Nola out of shame and denial.

Frank, intending to invalidate Raglan&#x27;s methods, questions Jan Hartog, a former patient who is dying of psychoplasmic-induced lymphoma. He leaves Candice with Juliana and the two spend the evening viewing old photographs. Juliana tells Candice that Nola was frequently hospitalized as a child and often exhibited strange unexplained wheals on her skin that doctors were unable to diagnose. While in the kitchen, Juliana is attacked and bludgeoned to death by a small, dwarf-like child. Candice is traumatized, but physically unharmed.

Juliana&#x27;s ex-husband Barton returns for the funeral and attempts to contact Nola, but Raglan turns him away. Frank invites Candice&#x27;s teacher, Ruth Mayer, home for dinner to discuss his daughter&#x27;s performance in school. Barton interrupts with a drunken phone call from Juliana&#x27;s home, demanding that Frank and he go to Raglan&#x27;s institute to see Nola. Frank leaves to calm Barton, leaving Candice in Ruth&#x27;s care. While he&#x27;s away, Ruth answers a phone call from Nola, who, recognizing her voice and believing her to be having an affair with Frank, insults her and angrily warns Ruth to stay away from her family. Meanwhile, Frank arrives to find Barton murdered by the same deformed dwarf-child, who dies after attempting to kill Frank.

An autopsy of the dwarf-child reveals a multitude of bizarre anatomical anomalies: the creature is asexual, supposedly colorblind, naturally toothless and devoid of a navel, indicating no known means of natural human birth. After the murders catch the attention of newspapers, Raglan reluctantly acknowledges that the deaths coincided with his sessions with Nola relating to their respective topics. He closes his institute and sends his patients to municipal care with the exception of Nola. Frank is alerted about the closure of the institute by Hartog.

Mike Trellan, one of Raglan&#x27;s other patients, tells Frank that Nola is now Raglan&#x27;s &quot;queen bee&quot; and in charge of some &quot;disturbed children&quot; in an attic. When Candice returns to school, two dwarf-children attack and kill Ruth in front of her class before absconding with Candice to the institute, with Frank in pursuit. Upon arrival, Raglan tells Frank the truth about the dwarf-children: they are the accidental product of Nola&#x27;s psychoplasmic sessions; her rage about her abuse was so strong that she parthenogenetically bore a brood of creatures resembling children who psychically respond and act on the targets of her rage, with Nola completely unaware of their actions. Realizing the brood are too dangerous to keep anymore, Raglan plans to venture into their quarters and rescue Candice, provided that Frank can keep Nola calm to avoid provoking the children.

Frank feigns rapprochement long enough for Raglan to collect Candice, but when he witnesses Nola give birth to another child through a psychoplasmically-induced external womb, she notices his disgust when she licks the child clean. The brood awakens and kills Raglan. Nola then threatens to kill Candice rather than lose her. The brood goes after Candice, who hides in a closet, but they begin to break through the door and try to grab her. In desperation, Frank strangles Nola to death, and the brood dies without its mother&#x27;s psychic connection. Frank carries a visibly traumatized Candice back to his car and the two depart. As the pair sit in silence, two small lesions—a germinal stage of the phenomenon experienced by Nola—appear on Candice&#x27;s arm.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Screenplay===
In retrospect, Cronenberg stated that he felt &quot;The Brood&quot; was &quot;the most classic horror film I&#x27;ve done&quot; in terms of structure. He conceived the screenplay in the aftermath of a bitter divorce which included a custody battle over their daughter. During his divorce, Cronenberg became aware of the drama &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; (also released in 1979), and was disillusioned by its optimistic depiction of a familial breakdown after a couple&#x27;s separation. In response, he began writing the screenplay for &quot;The Brood&quot;, aspiring to depict the strife between a divorced couple battling over their child.

===Casting===
In casting the roles of Frank and Nola Carveth, Cronenberg sought actors who were &quot;vague facsimiles&quot; of himself and his wife. Canadian actor Art Hindle was cast in the role of Frank. There was difficulty in casting Nola Carveth. Samantha Eggar, whom Cronenberg stated &quot;looked a little like my ex-wife&quot; and had a husband that looked like him, was selected. Cronenberg met Eggar ten years later at the Sitges Film Festival where she told him that &quot;&quot;The Brood&quot; was the strangest and most repulsive film I&#x27;ve ever done&quot;.

Oliver Reed was cast in the role of Hal Raglan, the psychotherapist who has kept Nola sequestered after her divorce from Frank. Reed accepted a reduced salary for the role. This marked the second time Eggar and Reed had starred in a film together, having previously co-starred in &quot;The Lady in the Car with Glasses and a Gun&quot; (1970). Additionally, Eggar and Reed had known one another personally, having grown up together in Bledlow, England. Eggar was impressed by Cronenberg&#x27;s screenplay, and agreed to appear in the film, as she felt the role of Nola was &quot;almost Shakespearean...  How could you turn this part down?&quot;

===Filming===
Les Productions Mutuelles Ltée and Elgin International Productions produced the film as The Brood Films. The film was shot in Toronto from 14 November to 21 December 1978, on a budget of $1,400,000 () with $200,000 coming from the Canadian Film Development Corporation. The Kortright Centre for Conservation, just north of Toronto, was used as the location of the Somafree Institute. Additional photography was done in Mississauga.

Eggar recalled the production crew being very small, with only around seven crew members in total while she was filming her sequences, many of them &quot;academics and PhDs, standing there holding lights&quot;. Her scenes were shot over a period of three days. To portray the brood of children, Cronenberg cast a group of child gymnasts from Toronto.

&quot;The Brood&quot; was the first Cronenberg film to have an original soundtrack. Howard Shore has written the music for most of Cronenberg&#x27;s subsequent films.

==Release==
===Censorship===
&quot;The Brood&quot; had cuts demanded for an R-rating for its theatrical release in the United States. Eggar conceived the idea of licking the new fetuses that her character Nola Carveth has spawned. &quot;I just thought that when cats have their kittens or dogs have puppies (and I think at that time I had about 8 dogs), they lick them as soon as they’re born. Lick, lick, lick, lick, lick…,&quot; Eggar said.

However, when the climactic scene was censored, Cronenberg responded: &quot;I had a long and loving close-up of Samantha licking the fetus […] when the censors, those animals, cut it out, the result was that a lot of people thought she was eating her baby. That&#x27;s much worse than I was suggesting.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Brood&quot; was released as &quot;Chromosome 3&quot; in France and &quot;La Clinique De La Terreur&quot; in Quebec. The film was distributed by New World Pictures and opened in the United States on 25 May 1979, Canada on 1 June, France on 10 October, and the United Kingdom on 13 March 1980. The French dub was released in Montreal on 14 March 1980. After its screenings in Toronto and Chicago, &quot;The Brood&quot; grossed $685,000 over only a period of ten days between the two cities. By 1981, the film had grossed over $5 million. Cronenberg was able to purchase a home using his earnings from the film.

===Critical response===
While &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an extremely well made, if essentially unpleasant shocker&quot;, Leonard Maltin reviewed the film in two sentences: &quot;Eggar eats her own afterbirth while midget clones beat grandparents and lovely young schoolteachers to death with mallets. It&#x27;s a big, wide, wonderful world we live in!&quot; and rated it an outright &quot;BOMB&quot;. Roger Ebert called it &quot;a bore&quot; and &quot;disgusting in ways that are not entertaining; as opposed, for example, to the great disgusting moments in &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;&quot;, and even went as far as asking, &quot;Are there really people who want to see reprehensible trash like this?&quot; concluding with &quot;I guess so. It&#x27;s in its second week.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, Vaughn Palmer lambasted the film, referring to it as &quot;mean, foul and witless...  The people who made &quot;The Brood&quot; do not like people. They do not even appear to like themselves. They just like money.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;well-made&quot; and &quot;expertly acted,&quot; but criticized its depictions of violence, stating: &quot;Perhaps Cronenberg means to make an extreme comment upon the irresponsibility of psychiatrists and parents, but &quot;The Brood&quot; is so totally sickening it&#x27;s an irresponsible work itself.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Brood&quot; scored 81%. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Brood&quot; is a grotesque, squirming, hilariously shrill exploration of the bizarre and deadly side of motherhood&quot;.

In &quot;Cult Movies&quot;, Danny Peary, who openly disapproves of &quot;Shivers&quot; and &quot;Rabid&quot;, calls &quot;The Brood&quot; &quot;Cronenberg&#x27;s best film&quot; because &quot;we care about the characters&quot;, and, although he dislikes the ending, &quot;an hour and a half of absorbing, solid cinema&quot;. In his &quot;An Introduction to the American Horror Film&quot;, critic Robin Wood views &quot;The Brood&quot; as a reactionary work portraying feminine power as irrational and horrifying, and the dangerous attempts of Oliver Reed&#x27;s character&#x27;s psychoanalysis as an analogue to the dangers of trying to undo repression in society.

&quot;The Brood&quot; was listed #88 on the &quot;Chicago Film Critics Association&#x27;s 100 Scariest Movies of All-Time&quot;. In 2004, one of its sequences was voted #78 among the &quot;100 Scariest Movie Moments&quot; by the Bravo Channel.

The film was released on VHS in 1982, and on DVD in its original uncensored version by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 26, 2003. Anchor Bay Entertainment subsequently released the film on DVD in the United Kingdom 2005.

In mid-2013, the Criterion Collection added &quot;The Brood&quot;, as well as &quot;Scanners&quot;, to their selection of films available to Hulu and iTunes customers. The film was subsequently issued on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection on October 13, 2015, featuring a new 2K scan of the original film elements.

==Related works==
A novelization by Richard Starks was published to coincide with the film&#x27;s initial release. In 2009, Spyglass Entertainment announced a remake from a script by Cory Goodman, to be directed by Breck Eisner. Eisner left the project in 2010.

==Analysis==
Cronenberg stated that it was his only film without humor. Child characters rarely appear in his films, with Cronenberg stating that having a child made it unbearable, but child characters are present in &quot;The Brood&quot; as &quot;it was cathartic, I had to do it, but I have never done it since&quot; according to Cronenberg.

Written in the aftermath of writer-director Cronenberg&#x27;s divorce from his wife, &quot;The Brood&quot; has been noted by critics and film scholars for its prominent themes surrounding fears of parenthood, as well as corollary preoccupations with repression and the treatment of mental illness in women.

Film theorist Barbara Creed notes that Nola&#x27;s parthenogenetic births are thematically &quot;used to demonstrate the horrors of unbridled maternal power&quot; in which a woman gives birth to &quot;deformed manifestations of herself&quot;. Scholar Sarah Arnold similarly suggests that, despite Nola&#x27;s apparent representation as a &quot;bad mother&quot; epitomizing &quot;the monstrous feminine&quot;, &quot;The Brood&quot; &quot;does not disseminate such images unproblematically, [and] instead questions these already (culturally and socially) pre-existing notions of the maternal and motherhood...  the film fuses the concerns of the woman&#x27;s film with that of the body horror film.&quot;

Feminist critic Carrie Rickey notes that, like many of Cronenberg&#x27;s films, &quot;The Brood&quot; has been accused of presenting a misogynistic representation of women. However, Rickey argues against this assertion, writing: &quot;For me, Cronenberg’s gynophobia is a nonissue. It’s blaming the victim. After all, aren’t we talking about movies where male scientists use women as guinea pigs and then are shocked, shocked when the test subjects become monstrous, voracious, etc.? Let me invoke the Jessica Rabbit defense: The women are not bad, they’re just drawn that way. It’s the male scientists who have inadvertently transformed them into men’s worst nightmares.&quot;

<text>Malay cuisine (; Jawi: ) is the traditional food of the ethnic Malays of Southeast Asia, residing in modern-day Malaysia, Indonesia (parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan), Singapore, Brunei, Southern Thailand and the Philippines (mostly southern) as well as Cocos Islands, Christmas Island, Sri Lanka and South Africa.

The main characteristic of traditional Malay cuisine is the generous use of spices. Coconut milk is also important in giving Malay dishes their rich, creamy character. The other foundation is &quot;belacan&quot; (prawn paste), which is used as a base for , a rich sauce or condiment made from , chilli peppers, onions and garlic. Malay cooking also makes plentiful use of lemongrass and galangal.

Nearly every Malay meal is served with rice, which is also the staple food in many other Asian cultures. Although there are various types of dishes in a Malay meal, all are served at once, not in courses. A typical meal consists of a plate of rice for each person on the table. Dishes are meant to be shared among the diners and each dish is provided with a spoon. The diner proceeds to spoon the dishes of their choosing onto their rice plate.
Food is eaten delicately with the fingers of the right hand, never with the left which is used for personal ablutions, and Malays rarely use utensils.

==History and influences==
It is uncertain when the Malay culinary traditions took shape, but the earliest record of the tradition is from the 15th century when the Malacca Sultanate became the important trade centre in the Malay Archipelago. The most important legacy of Malacca derived from its involvement in the spice trade, its openness to the ingredients and culinary techniques introduced by foreigners notably the Arabs, Persians, Chinese and Indians and its cultivation of a rich eclectic gastronomy. Malacca was also a catalyst for the development of two other rich and unique culinary cultures which are the fusion of Malay with Chinese and European traditions, cuisines respectively known as Nyonya and Eurasian. In the centuries before and after Malacca, there were other non-Malay groups from Buginese and Javanese to Minangkabau who were absorbed into Malay society at different times, aided by similarity in lifestyle and a common religion, and had varying degrees of influence on Malay food.

It is important to understand the nuance and differences of what makes a dish Malay, which is intertwined with the differences between the concept of Malay as an ethnic group or as a race. In Indonesia, Malay cuisine more specifically refers to the cuisine of ethnic Malay people who traditionally inhabit the east coast of Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and coastal Borneo. In Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and outside the Malay Archipelago (such as Sri Lanka and South Africa) however, the term &quot;Malay cuisine&quot; often takes a broader scope, which includes the culinary traditions of other neighbouring common Austronesian peoples, often including Minangkabaus, Javanese and Bugis, or even their fusion derivatives.

&quot;Nasi lemak&quot;, rice cooked in rich coconut milk, is probably the most popular dish, ubiquitous in Malay towns and villages. is considered Malaysia&#x27;s national dish. Another example is &quot;ketupat&quot; or &quot;nasi himpit&quot;, compressed rice cooked in palm leaves. It is popular especially during &quot;Hari Raya&quot;. Various meats and vegetables could be made into&quot; gulai &quot;or &quot;kari&quot;, a type of curry dish with variations of spice mixtures that display an Indian influence long present in Malay cuisine. Since most Malays are Muslims, Malay cuisine rigorously observes Islamic halal dietary law. Protein intake is mostly taken from beef, water buffalo, goat, and lamb, and also includes poultry and fish. Pork, non-halal meat, and alcohol are prohibited. &quot;Laksa&quot;, a fusion of Malay and Chinese cuisine, is also a popular dish. Malay cuisine has also adopted some neighbouring food traditions, such as &quot;rendang&quot; adopted from Minangkabau cuisine in Sumatra, &quot;nasi ulam&quot; from Betawi cuisine and satays from Javanese cuisine in Java. However, the Malays have developed distinctive tastes and recipes.

Malay cuisine has also spread outside the Malay Archipelago and influenced other cuisine there. &quot;Bobotie&quot; is a South African dish with its origins in Cape Malay. It consists of spiced minced meat baked with an egg-based topping. Of the many dishes common to South Africa, is perhaps closest to being the national dish because it is not commonly found in any other country. The recipe originates from the Dutch East India Company colonies in Batavia, with the name derived from the Indonesian &quot;bobotok&quot;. In other countries, &quot;kalu dodol&quot; is a Sri Lankan dessert with Sri Lankan Malay origins. It consists of jaggery (from the sap of the toddy palm), rice flour and coconut milk.

==Terminology==
Nearly every culture and language has contributed to the culinary language, including Malay with its own food terminology embracing its preparation, methods of cooking, and numerous food names. Malay food terminology has been shaped by cultural transmission over many generations. Traditionally Malay parents would pass down the skills and processes of cooking to their children through daily cooking activities as well as traditional events, including wedding ceremonies.

===Food preparation===

In Malay food preparation, the ingredients used are often described as spicy and flavorful as it is a melting pot of spices, herbs and roots. Strong, tangy and flavorful fresh herbs, spices and ingredients such as (lemongrass), (screwpine), (a type of basil), (polygonum), (nutmeg), (turmeric) and (wild ginger buds), (mustard seeds) and (fenugreek) are often used. There are also a number of terms used for the equipment and utensils used for food preparation. Traditional cooking equipment includes several types of grinders called (pestle and mortar), (stone roller), and the (mill) used for preparing spices and pastes. Vegetables are diced on a (wooden cutting board); while a coconut scraper or is indispensable in making both curries and sweets. Pastries are also made for desserts and for this a (rolling pin) and (pastry board) are considered essential.

===Cooking methods===

Traditional cooking methods in Malay cuisine are quite similar to life in Malay villages, slow and relaxed, as most Malay food is cooked on low heat for a long time compared to Chinese food. There are numerous methods of cooking which consist of dry and moist methods. (using a small amount of oil or fat in a shallow pan over relatively high heat), (food smoked or grilled with the ingredients often cut into pieces or thinly sliced to facilitate fast cooking), (food, mainly dried spices, fried without oil), and (warmed over low heat to dry) are examples of terms for dry-heat cooking methods. On the other hand, moist-heat cooking methods includes terms such as (cooking in a pot, especially rice), (boiling or simmering), (blanching or dipping food such as vegetables into hot water) and (simmering or boiling food).

===Characteristics===
As defined by Ainuddin, Malay food has five characteristics: 
* It is rich in herbs and spices;
* Coconut milk is one of the main ingredients;
* It is usually spicy;
* Meat is usually stewed with a thick gravy; and 
* Fried fish and seafood are usually seasoned with turmeric powder.

==Regional cuisine variations==
===Brunei===

Bruneian Malay cuisine is often spicy and commonly eaten with either rice or noodles. Beef &quot;rendang&quot;, &quot;nasi lemak&quot; and are popular foods in Brunei. Among the few dishes peculiar to Brunei is &quot;ambuyat&quot;, a sticky ball of flavourless sago starch, which is wrapped around a bamboo fork and dipped into a spicy and sour gravy.

Nasi katok, which literally means &quot;knock rice&quot;, is a popular meal which consists of plain rice, fried chicken and sambal, a spicy relish made from ground chilli peppers and a variety of secondary ingredients including but not limited to shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, shallot, scallion, palm sugar, lime juice, vinegar and anchovies. is traditionally served wrapped in brown paper.

===Indonesia===

The cuisine of Malay Indonesians spread on the east coast of Sumatra and Kalimantan, primarily West Kalimantan. Because of the close ethnic kinship and proximity to Malaysian Malays, many dishes are shared between the two countries. For example, &quot;nasi lemak&quot; and &quot;nasi ulam&quot; are considered native dishes of Riau and Jambi. Malay cuisine also shares many similarities with the neighboring Minangkabau cuisine of West Sumatra, Palembangese cuisine of South Sumatra and Acehnese cuisine of Aceh, such as sharing &quot;gulai&quot;, &quot;asam pedas&quot;, &quot;kari&quot;, &quot;lemang&quot;, &quot;nasi minyak&quot;, &quot;pempek&quot;, &quot;pindang&quot;, &quot;rendang&quot; and &quot;roti canai&quot;. This is due to the fact that the Minangkabaus are culturally closely related to the Malays. Malay Indonesian cuisine has also been influenced by Arab, Betawi, Chinese, Indian and Javanese cuisine.

&quot;Otak-otak&quot; is a dish involving fish pieces wrapped in banana leaves. The grilled fish cake is made of ground fish mixed with tapioca starch and spices.
&quot;Tempoyak&quot; is a fermented durian sauce and &quot;belacan&quot; is a Malay-style sambal made of fresh chillies and toasted &quot;belacan&quot; in a stone mortar. Both are familiar condiments in Sumatra.

Other Malay Indonesian dishes include &quot;acar&quot;, &quot;amplang&quot;, &quot;ayam goreng&quot;, &quot;ayam pansuh&quot;, &quot;ayam penyet&quot;, &quot;ayam percik&quot;, &quot;begedil&quot;, &quot;bihun goreng&quot;, &quot;bobotok&quot;, &quot;bubur asyura&quot;, &quot;bubur cha cha&quot;, &quot;bubur lambuk&quot;, &quot;bubur pedas&quot;, &quot;cincalok&quot;, &quot;epok-epok&quot;, various &quot;gulai&quot;, &quot;ikan bakar&quot;, various &quot;ikan patin&quot; dishes, &quot;kangkung belacan&quot;, &quot;kemplang&quot;, &quot;ketupat&quot;, &quot;kwetiau goreng&quot;, various &quot;laksa&quot;, &quot;lepat&quot;, &quot;lontong&quot;, &quot;martabak&quot;, &quot;mi celor&quot;, &quot;mi goreng&quot;, &quot;mi kari&quot;, &quot;mi rebus&quot;, &quot;nasi ambeng&quot;, &quot;nasi briyani&quot;, various &quot;nasi goreng&quot;, &quot;nasi kari&quot;, &quot;nasi kebuli&quot;, &quot;pekasam&quot;, &quot;rojak&quot;, &quot;roti jala&quot;, &quot;roti john&quot;, &quot;roti tisu&quot;, sambal &quot;sotong&quot;, &quot;samosa&quot;, satay, &quot;sayur lodeh&quot;, various &quot;siput gonggong&quot; dishes, &quot;soto&quot;, &quot;soto mi&quot;, &quot;sup ikan&quot;, &quot;sup kambing&quot;, &quot;sup rusa&quot;, &quot;tauhu goreng&quot;, &quot;tekwan&quot;, &quot;terang bulan&quot; and &quot;ulam&quot;.

===Malaysia===

Malaysian Malay cuisine bears many similarities to Malay Indonesian cuisine. It has also been influenced by Chinese, Indian, Thai, Javanese and Minangkabau cuisine. Many Malay dishes revolve around the &quot;rempah&quot;, which is usually sauteed in oil to draw out its flavours to form the base of a dish. A dipping relish called is an essential accompaniment for most Malay dishes.

&quot;Nasi lemak&quot; is rice cooked in rich coconut milk and considered Malaysia&#x27;s national dish.

The drink &quot;sirap bandung&quot; consists of evaporated or condensed milk flavoured with rose syrup, giving it a pink colour. The drink is an adaptation of rose milk from India.

Other Malay dishes in Malaysia include &quot;apam balik&quot;, &quot;ayam goreng&quot;, &quot;ayam masak merah&quot;, &quot;ayam pansuh&quot;, &quot;ayam percik&quot;, &quot;bubur pedas&quot;, &quot;char kway teow&quot;, &quot;cincalok&quot;, &quot;ikan bakar&quot;, various &quot;kari&quot;, &quot;karipap&quot;, &quot;kebebe&quot;, &quot;kerabu&quot;, &quot;keropok lekor&quot;, &quot;kerutuk daging&quot;, various &quot;laksa&quot;, Maggi &quot;goreng&quot;, &quot;masak lemak&quot;, &quot;mee bandung&quot;, &quot;mee Jawa&quot;, &quot;mee kolo&quot;, &quot;mee siam&quot;, &quot;mee soto&quot;, &quot;mee wantan&quot;, &quot;nasi ambeng&quot;, &quot;nasi beriani&quot;, &quot;nasi dagang&quot;, &quot;Nasi kerabu&quot;, &quot;nasi goreng&quot;, &quot;nasi paprik&quot;, &quot;nasi tumpang&quot;, &quot;pek nga&quot;, &quot;roti canai&quot;, &quot;roti john&quot;, satay, &quot;taugeh ayam&quot;, &quot;tempoyak&quot; and &quot;ulam&quot;.

===Singapore===
Situated between Malaysia and Indonesia, Singaporean Malay dishes are influenced by the food of the neighbouring Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and the Riau Islands. Despite absorbing regional influences, it tends to be adapted to local tastes and differ from its counterparts in neighbouring countries.

===South Africa===

Cape Malay cuisine is a tradition of the Cape Malay people in South Africa. It has been influenced by Malay and Javanese cuisine. Thus, Cape Malay influence has brought spicy curries, , pickled fish and a variety of fish stews to South Africa. Adaptations of traditional foods such as &quot;bobotie&quot; and &quot;sosatie&quot; are staples in many South African homes. Faldela Williams wrote three cookbooks, including the &quot;Cape Malay Cookbook&quot;, which was instrumental in preserving the cultural traditions of Cape Malay cuisine.

&quot;Sosatie&quot; is a traditional Cape Malay dish of meat (usually lamb or mutton) cooked on skewers. The term is derived from &quot;sate&quot; (skewered meat) and &quot;saus&quot; (spicy sauce). To prepare it, mutton chunks are marinated overnight in fried onions, chillies, garlic, curry leaves and tamarind juice, then threaded on skewers and either pan-fried or grilled.

Cape Malay yellow rice, a sweet dish made with raisins, cinnamon and sugar, also has its origins in Cape Malay cookery, often referred to as Cape Malay yellow rice.

Other Cape Malay dishes include biryani, &quot;boeber&quot;, chutney, falooda, &quot;frikkadel&quot;, &quot;koesister&quot;, roti, sambals, &quot;samoosa&quot; and &quot;tomato bredie&quot;.

<text>Canning Town is a district in the London Borough of Newham, East London, England, north of the Royal Victoria Dock. Its urbanisation was largely due to the creation of the dock. The area was part of the ancient parish and County Borough of West Ham It forms part of the London E16 postcode district.

The area is undergoing significant regeneration , with the building of up to 10,000 new homes.

==History==
===Bridges facilitate development===
Before the 19th century, the district was largely marshland, and accessible only by boat, or a toll bridge. In 1809, an Act of Parliament was passed for the construction of the Barking Road between the East India Docks and Barking. A five-span iron bridge was constructed in 1810 to carry the road across the River Lea at Bow Creek. This bridge was damaged by a collision with a collier in March 1887 and replaced by the London County Council (LCC) in 1896. This bridge was in turn replaced in 1934, at a site to the north and today&#x27;s concrete flyover begun in smaller form in the 1960s, but successively modified to incorporate new road layouts for the upgraded A13 road and a feeder to the Limehouse Link tunnel, avoiding the Blackwall Tunnel. The abutments of the old iron bridge have now been utilised for the Jubilee footbridge, linking the area to Leamouth, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, on the western bank of the Lea.

The area is thought to be named after the first Viceroy of India, Charles John Canning, who suppressed the Indian Mutiny about the time the district expanded. The population increased rapidly after the North London Line was built from Stratford to North Woolwich, in 1846. This was built to carry coal and goods from the docks; and when the passenger station was first built it was known as &quot;Barking Road&quot;. Speculative builders constructed houses for the workers attracted by the new chemical industries established in the lower reaches of the River Lea, and for the nearby Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company and Tate &amp; Lyle refinery.



===Royal Victoria Dock opens===
The opening of the Royal Victoria Dock in 1855 accelerated the development of the area creating employment and a need to house dock workers and their families. New settlements around the dock developed, starting with Canning Town and Hallsville (Hallsville generall being seen as part of Canning Town), and later the areas now known as Custom House and Silvertown. The new settlements lacked water supply and had no sewage system, leading to the spread of cholera and smallpox. The casual nature of employment at the docks meant poverty and squalid living conditions for many residents, and in 1857 Henry Morley wrote about the area:

The industries around the dock were often unhealthy and dangerous. As trade unions and political activists fought for better living conditions and the dock area became the centre of numerous movements with Will Thorne, James Keir Hardie and other later becoming leading figures in the Labour Party. Thorne and others worked and gave speeches at Canning Town Public Hall which had been built in 1894 as the population grew in the southern part of the borough.

===Diversity===
From the late 19th century, a large African mariner community was established in Canning Town as a result of new shipping links to the Caribbean and West Africa. Prior to the &quot;Windrush&quot; era, Canning Town had London&#x27;s largest black population of any area in London. The area around Crown Street (formerly located just north of the Royal Victoria Dock, but destroyed in the Blitz) was known as Draughtboard Alley due its ethnic mix.

Notable black people from Canning Town include footballers Fred Corbett, who played for Thames Ironworks F.C. and its successor team West Ham United; and Jack Leslie, who was called up to play for England, but then dropped without explanation, possibly due to racial prejudice. 

The second black West Ham player, was another Canning Town man, John Charles. John Charles became the first black person to represent England at any level when he appeared for the Under 18s, scoring a goal in a 3-1 win over Israel.

John Charles younger brother Clive Charles also played for West Ham. In 1972 West Ham were the first top-flight team to field three Black players. Clive Charles and teammates Clyde Best and Ade Coker featured in a 3-1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur. Clive Charles would go on to manage the United States football team.

A further example of the area&#x27;s long-standing multi-cultural nature is Indian-born doctor Chuni Lal Katial, who practised in Canning Town for several years from around 1929. Katial was an acquaintance of Mahatma Gandhi and invited him to meet Charlie Chaplin, one of the most famous actors in the world, at his surgery in Beckton Road. Gandhi was staying at Kingsley Hall, in nearby Bromley-by-Bow, for the three-month duration of his talks with the UK government on the future of India. Katial, a noted health pioneer, later moved to the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury, in north London, where he became Britain&#x27;s first south Asian Mayor.

===Silvertown explosion===
In 1917 50 tons of TNT exploded at the Brunner Mond &amp; Co ammunition work in nearby Silvertown, causing the Silvertown explosion, the largest explosion in London&#x27;s history and damaging more than 70,000 buildings and killing 73 people.

===Slum clearance===
In the 1930s the County Borough of West Ham commenced slum clearances. New houses, clinics, nurseries and a lido were opened. Silvertown ByPass and Britain&#x27;s first flyover, the Silvertown Way, were built along with other new approach roads to the docks. Canning Town was heavily hit by the bombings in World War II and West Ham Council&#x27;s plan to rebuild the area focused on a reduction of the population, transferring industry and the building of new housing such as the Keir Hardie Estate, which included schools and welfare services. In the early hours of 10 September 1940, a bomb hit South Hallsville School where up to 600 local refugees were accommodated. At least 200, mainly children, were killed or injured. Many bodies were never recovered.

The slum clearances and the devastation of World War II, destroying 85% of the housing stock, led to the preponderance of council estates that characterise the area today. Post-war housing schemes followed the urban planning principles of the garden city movement. As demand for housing grew the first high rise buildings were built in Canning Town in 1961. In 1968 part of Ronan Point, a 22-storey tower block in Newham, collapsed and most of the tall tower blocks built in the area in the early 1960s were eventually demolished or reduced in size.

== Slum housing ==


=== Victorian era ===
In 1857 Henry Morley published a detailed description of the area in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Household Words&quot; entitled &quot;Londoners over the Border&quot;, writing:

&quot;...by the law there is one suburb on the border of the Essex marshes which is quite cut off from the comforts of the Metropolitan Buildings Act;-in fact, it lies just without its boundaries, and therefore is chosen as a place of refuge for offensive trade establishments turned out of the town, - those of oil boilers, gut spinners, varnish makers, printers ink makers and the like. Being cut off from the support of the Metropolitan Local Managing Act, this outskirt is free to possess new streets of houses without drains, roads, gas, or pavement.&quot;

Describing the slum housing conditions and its effect on the health of local residents, Morley wrote:

&quot;Rows of small houses, which may have cost for their construction eighty pounds a piece, are built designedly and systematically with their backs to the marsh ditches; ...to or three yards of clay pipe &quot;drain&quot; each house into the open cess pool under its back windows, when it does not happen that the house is built as to overhang it... In winter time every block becomes now and then an island, and you may hear a sick man, in an upper room, complain of water trickling down over his bed. Then the flood cleans the ditches, lifting all their filth into itself, and spreading it over the land. No wonder that the stench of the marsh in Hallsville and Canning Town of nights, is horrible. A fetid mist covers the ground... the parish surgeon... was himself for a time invalided by fever, upon which ague followed. , of course, is one of the most prevalent diseases of the district; fever abounds. When an epidemic comes into the place, it becomes serious in its form, and stays for months. Disease comes upon human bodies saturated with the influences of such air as is breathed day and night, as a spark upon touchwood. A case or two of small pox caused, in spite of vaccination, an epidemic of confluent small pox, which remained three or four months upon the spot.&quot;

Morley also describes efforts to improve the housing conditions in the area:

&quot;Two years ago, when application was made by more than a tenth of the rate payers of the parish of West Ham for an inquiry into the sanitary condition of the district, with a view to bringing it under the conditions of the Public Health Act, Mr Alfred Dickens was the civil engineer sent by the general Board of Health as an inspector. His report and the evidence at his inquiry is before us as we write, and it dwells very much upon the state of Canning Town and Hallsville. We learn from this report that the area of the ditches in the parish amounted to not less than one hundred and fifty acres, according to a surveyors book upwards of thirty five years old, and that area has been increased by side cuttings at the railway and new cuttings of open sewer. Disease had cost the parish six hundred pounds in the year previous to the inquiry. There was then, of course, as now, no drainage or paving in Canning Town; the roads in winter were impassable; but the inhabitants were paying (for what they did not get) an eighteen penny rate under the Commissioners Act, not for works done in accordance with it, but &quot;for the expenses of the act&quot;. Also, although the parish did not take charge of their roads, they were paying a highway rate for the parishioners elsewhere. One horrible detail in Mr Dickens report has, happily, to be omitted from our sketch. Two years ago, there was in Hallsville and Canning Town no water supply. Good water is now laid on. In all other respects, the old offences against civilised life cleave to the district. The local Board of Health which the inhabitants of the parish sought and obtained, whatever it may have done for Stratford, seems to have done nothing for Hallsville, unless it be considered something to indulge it with an odd pinch of deodorising powder.&quot;
Alfred Dickens highlighted the severe overcrowding suffered by many of the slum inhabitants as a result of landlord charging high rents and households relying on casual work.

=== 20th century ===
The 1890 Housing Act made the local council responsible for providing decent accommodation, and in the 1890s some of the first council houses were built in Bethell Avenue. However, many of the terraced houses built during the late 19th century were little more than slums and cleared by the council in the 1930s. The council replaced the terraces with the first high-rise blocks.

=== 21st Century ===
According to Newham London Borough Council, Canning Town and Custom House are among the five per cent most deprived areas in the UK. Residents suffer from poor health, low education and poverty. 17 per cent of the working age population have a limiting long-term illness, 17.5 per cent claim income support and 49.7 per cent of 16- to 74-year-olds have no formal qualifications.

==Regeneration project==

The consultation and governance mechanism of the currently ongoing regeneration project is underpinning by a partnership between councillors, residents, local businesses and other &quot;partners&quot;. According to Newham council:

&quot;The views of residents and businesses is central to the development and delivery of the regeneration initiative and developers will be expected to continue with extensive community consultation and engagement as part of their remit.&quot;

Newham council is currently attempting to encourage &quot;re-interpretations&quot; of London&#x27;s established street and housing forms. The council has identified terraced housing as such housing form, stating that it &quot;continues to have enduring popularity with all types of residents including families and children&quot;.

The area is at the western end of the Thames Gateway zone and is currently undergoing a £2.7 billion regeneration project, which includes:

* demolishing 2,750 homes and building 10,000 new homes
* creating 500,000 square metres of floor-space in a revitalised town centre
* providing community facilities, including a library, a health centre
* undertaking improvements to primary schools

The Olympic Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre, which was located in Canning Town, was due to be demolished and replaced with a new industrial estate as part of the Olympic Legacy programme.

==Politics and local government==
The area falls within the West Ham and Beckton constituency. The local Member of Parliament is James Asser from Labour. Canning Town Town North and Canning Town South wards are in the London Borough of Newham.

In May 2002, Canning Town South was the only ward in the Borough to return a non-Labour councillor. In 2006, residents elected three Christian Peoples Alliance candidates, one of whom was Alan Craig. In 2010, Labour gained all three seats and have held them with significant majorities since.

===2022 local election===







































==Culture==
Thames Ironworks F.C., the works team of the nearby Ironworks, went on to become West Ham United F.C. after turning professional.

The Bridge House, a public house named for the 1887 &quot;Iron Bridge&quot;, was at 23 Barking Road – now demolished. The venue operated during the 1970s and 1980s and was host to The Police, Depeche Mode, Jeff Beck, Billy Bragg, Alexis Korner, Modern Romance, Sham 69, Lindisfarne, The Cockney Rejects, Iron Maiden, Remus Down Boulevard and many other notable acts. A venue bearing the name The Bridge House 2 was opened in Bidder Street in more recent years.

==Administrative History==
The area was part of the ancient parish of West Ham, in the hundred of Becontree in Essex. It became part of the new County Borough of West Ham in 1900 (The parish and the County Borough had near identical boundaries).

Then in 1965 the area became part of the new London Borough of Newham in Greater London.

<text>The Republic of Cameroon is divided into ten regions. 

==History==

Between 1961 and 1972, Cameroon was a federal republic made up of two federated states, East Cameroon and West Cameroon.

A unitary system came into being in 1972. The country was then divided into provinces. In 1983, Centre-South Province was divided into Centre and South and at the same time, Adamawa and Far North Provinces were split from North Province. See summary of administrative history in Zeitlyn 2018.

In 2008, the President of the Republic of Cameroon, President Paul Biya signed decrees abolishing &quot;provinces&quot; and replacing them with &quot;regions&quot;. Hence, all of the country&#x27;s ten provinces are now known as regions.

The Northwest region and Southwest region were granted special status in December 2019, giving them additional powers.

<text>Feargus Edward O&#x27;Connor (18 July 1796 – 30 August 1855) was an Irish Chartist leader and advocate of the Land Plan, which sought to provide smallholdings for the labouring classes. A highly charismatic figure, O&#x27;Connor was admired for his energy and oratory, but was criticised for alleged egotism. His newspaper &quot;Northern Star&quot; (1837–1852) was widely read among workers (and read aloud in taverns), becoming the voice of the Chartist movement.

After the failure of his Land Plan, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s behaviour became increasingly erratic, culminating in an assault on three MPs and a mental breakdown, from which he did not recover. After his death three years later at the age of 59, 40,000 people witnessed the funeral procession.

== Early life ==
Feargus O&#x27;Connor was born on 18 July 1796 in Connorville house, near Castletown-Kinneigh in west County Cork, into a prominent Irish Protestant family. He was originally christened Edward Bowen O&#x27;Connor, but his father chose to call him Feargus. His father was Irish nationalist politician Roger O&#x27;Connor, who like his uncle Arthur O&#x27;Connor was active in the United Irishmen. His elder brother Francis became a general in Simón Bolívar&#x27;s army of liberation in South America. 
Much of his early life was spent on his family&#x27;s estates in Ireland, which included Dangan Castle, the childhood home of the Duke of Wellington. He was educated mainly at Portarlington Grammar School and had some elementary schooling in England.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s father Roger was notorious for his eccentric lifestyle. At one point Feargus and Francis decided to leave, stealing horses from their brother Roderic, travelling to London and asking to be taken in by family friend M.P. Francis Burdett. Burdett looked after them, and financed Feargus to run a farm in Ireland, but it was unsuccessful. He studied law at Trinity College, Dublin, before inheriting his uncle&#x27;s estate in 1820. He took no degree, but was called to the Irish bar about 1820. Since he had to take an oath of allegiance to the crown to become a member of the Bar, his father disinherited him because he regarded it as inconsistent with the dignity of a descendant of the Kings of Ireland.

== Political career ==
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first known public speech was made in 1822 at Enniskeen, County Cork, denouncing landlords and the Protestant clergy. During that year he composed a pamphlet &quot;State of Ireland&quot;. Around this time he was wounded in a fight with soldiers, perhaps as a member of the Whiteboys covert agrarian organisation. Going to London to escape arrest, he tried to make a living by writing. He produced five manuscripts at this time, but none were ever published.

In 1831 O&#x27;Connor agitated for the Reform Bill in County Cork, and, after its passage in 1832, he travelled about the county organising registration of the new electorate. During the 1830s he emerged as an advocate for Irish rights and democratic political reform, and a critic of the British Whig government&#x27;s policies on Ireland. In 1832, he was elected to the British House of Commons as Member of Parliament for County Cork, as a Repeal candidate rather than a Whig.

Feargus O&#x27;Connor came into Parliament as a follower of Daniel O&#x27;Connell, and his speeches during this time were devoted mainly to the Irish question. He was sarcastically described by Fraser&#x27;s Magazine as active, bustling, violent, a ready speaker, and the model of an Irish patriot, but as one who did nothing, suggested nothing, and found fault with everything. He voted with the radicals: for tax on property; for Thomas Attwood&#x27;s motion for an inquiry into the conditions that prevailed in England; and in support of Lord Ashley&#x27;s 1847 Factory Bill. He quarrelled with O&#x27;Connell, repudiating him for his practice of yielding to the Whigs, and came out in favour of a more aggressive Repeal policy.

In the general election of 1835 O&#x27;Connor was re-elected, but disqualified from being seated because he lacked sufficient property to qualify. However, it appears that he did have property valued at £300 a year. O&#x27;Connor next planned to raise a volunteer brigade for Isabella II of Spain in the First Carlist War, but when William Cobbett died in April 1835, he decided to run for Cobbett&#x27;s seat at Oldham. Oldham was a two-member constituency and Cobbett&#x27;s colleague John Fielden strongly advocated that Cobbett&#x27;s son John Morgan Cobbett should be the Radical candidate to replace his father. O&#x27;Connor presented himself as an alternative Radical candidate, but eventually withdrew, alleging Fielden had not been straightforward with him: whether because of the controversy over the selection of the candidate or the refusal of J M Cobbett to support disestablishment, Cobbett lost narrowly to a local &#x27;Liberal Conservative&#x27;.
In the 1837 general election he was nominated at Preston, but with no intention of taking votes from John Crawfurd, the only other anti-Tory candidate. Having been nominated and made his hustings speech, he withdrew once he and Crawfurd had won the show of hands traditionally called for before any polling took place

=== Radicalism and Chartism ===
From 1833 O&#x27;Connor had spoken to working men&#x27;s organisations and agitated in factory areas for the &quot;Five Cardinal Points of Radicalism,&quot; which were five of the six points later embodied in the People&#x27;s Charter. In 1837 he founded at Leeds, Yorkshire, a radical newspaper, the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, and worked with others for a radical Chartism through the London Democratic Association. O&#x27;Connor was the Leeds representative of the London Working Men&#x27;s Association (LWMA). He travelled Britain speaking at meetings, and was one of the most popular Chartist orators; some Chartists named their children after him. He was at various points arrested, tried and imprisoned for his views, receiving an 18-month sentence in 1840. He also became involved in internal struggles within the movement.

When the first wave of Chartism ebbed, O&#x27;Connor founded the Chartist Cooperative Land Company in 1845. It aimed to buy agricultural estates and subdivide the land into smallholdings which could be let to individuals. The impossibility of all subscribers acquiring one of the plots meant it was considered a lottery, and the company was declared illegal in 1851.

When Chartism again gained momentum O&#x27;Connor was elected in 1847 MP for Nottingham, and he organised the Chartist meeting on Kennington Common, London, in 1848. This meeting on 10 April proved a turning point: it was supposed to be followed by a procession. When the procession was ruled illegal, O&#x27;Connor asked the crowd to disperse, a decision contested by other radicals such as William Cuffay.

==Chartist Movement==

As early as 1833, while MP for Cork, O&#x27;Connor had delivered an address to the &quot;National Union of the Working Classes&quot;, a political society of London working men, expressing radical sentiments. However O&#x27;Connor truly came into his own not when addressing audiences of London artisans or in the House of Commons, but when he went north as a public speaker.

He began to spend a large part of his time travelling through the north of England, addressing huge meetings, in which he denounced the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act and advocated manhood suffrage. Only by securing the vote, O&#x27;Connor argued, could working people be rid of the hated New Poor Law.

O&#x27;Connor was a superb public speaker. He expressed defiance, determination and hope, and flavoured these speeches with comic similes and anecdotes. He looked the part of a popular leader, too. His physique was to his advantage: over six feet, muscular and massive, the &quot;model of a Phoenician Hercules&quot;. There is no doubt that the working people who heard O&#x27;Connor at these great meetings in the north of England in the late 1830s adored him.

The voice of the organization was O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, which first appeared on 18 November 1837 in Leeds. It met with immediate success and was soon the most widely bought provincial newspaper in Britain. Its editor was William Hill, a former Swedenborgian minister; Joshua Hobson was its publisher; and Bronterre O&#x27;Brien, former editor of the &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Guardian&quot;, became the principal leader-writer. Perhaps the most popular part of the paper was Feargus&#x27; weekly front page letter, often read aloud at meetings; but the inclusion of reports of Chartist meetings from around the country and of readers&#x27; poetry were also vital sections of a paper made it a very important instrument in unifying and promoting the Chartist cause.

When the London Working Men&#x27;s Association published the People&#x27;s Charter in 1838, O&#x27;Connor and the Star endorsed it but not the London leadership. O&#x27;Connor was not ready to accept the political leadership of the London Working Men&#x27;s Association. He knew that the workers wanted something more immediate than political education. He became the &quot;constant travelling, dominant leader of the movement&quot; He, not William Lovett, became the voice of Chartism.

===Physical Force vs. Moral Force===
From the beginning O&#x27;Connor was attacked by Lovett and other leaders of the London Working Men&#x27;s Association. They did not like his assertive leadership or the confrontational style of politics he represented. O&#x27;Connor, who had seen at first hand the embittered relations between workers and capitalists in the north of England, did not like the strategy of reasonable argument advocated by men like Lovett. He considered the situation was too urgent for that. O&#x27;Connor was not an insurrectionist but, like O’Connell in Ireland, he was not adverse to intimidating the authorities by a show of numbers. This was his thinking behind the organisation the monster meetings and mass petitions. On the question of moral force vs physical force, he chose his words carefully:

I have always been a man of peace. I have always denounced the man who strove to tamper with an oppressed people by any appeal to physical force. I have always said that moral force was the degree of deliberation in each man&#x27;s mind which told him when submission was a duty or resistance not a crime; and that a true application of moral force would effect every change, but in case it should fail, physical force would come to its aid like an electric shock — and no man could prevent it; but that he who advised or attempted to marshal it would be the first to desert it at the moment of danger. God forbid that I should wish to see my country plunged into horrors of physical revolution. I wish her to win her liberties by peaceful means.

When the Chartist petition with 1,283,000 signatures was rejected by Parliament in summer 1839, tension grew, culminating in the Newport Rising. O&#x27;Connor was not involved in the planning of this event, though he must have known that there was a mood for rebellion among Chartists. He was a dangerous man to the authorities, and a sentence of 18 months in York Castle was passed on him in May 1840. In his farewell message, he made clear what he had done for the movement:

Before we part, let us commune fairly together. See how I met you, what I found you, how I part from you, and what I leave you. I found you a weak and unconnected party, having to grace the triumphs of the Whigs. 
I found you weak as the mountain heather bending before the gentle breeze. I am leaving you strong as the oak that stands the raging storms.
 I found you knowing your country but on the map. I leave you with its position engraven upon your hearts. 
I found you split up into local sections. I have levelled all those pigmy fences and thrown you into an imperial union…

O&#x27;Connor was jailed; while in prison he continued to write for the &quot;Northern Star&quot;. He was now the unquestioned leader of Chartism. It was at this time that the song &quot;Lion of Freedom&quot; was published in his honour. It was widely sung at Chartist meetings. Lovett, meanwhile, left the movement, full of anger at O&#x27;Connor but O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s energy and commitment was to keep Chartism alive for the rest of the 1840s.

In 1842 a convention of the newly formed National Charter Association was held in order to draw up a new petition that was finally signed by 3,315,752 persons. The petition was denied a hearing, which added to the frustrations felt by working people at a time of great economic hardship. Across Britain in summer 1842 a wave of strikes broke out, calling both for an end to wage cuts and the implementation of the People&#x27;s Charter.

===Anti-Corn Law League===
From its inception the Anti-Corn Law League vied with the Chartists for the support of working people. Bread was dear, and the League claimed that repealing the taxes on import of grain would allow the price to drop. Chartists argued that without the Charter, a repeal of the Corn Law would be of little use. Other factors in their favour were the distrust by working people of anything supported by the employers, and the fear that free trade would cause wages to drop still lower. This last point was stressed by O&#x27;Connor. He made biting attacks on the Anti-Corn Law League. In some towns – for example, Birmingham – O&#x27;Connorite Chartists broke up League meetings. O&#x27;Connor himself was certainly not afraid of taking on the leaders of the League head-on in debate – in 1844 he took on Richard Cobden in Northampton.

===National Land Company and the Petition of 1848===

Faced with the declining strength of Chartism after the defeats of 1842, O&#x27;Connor turned to the idea of settling working people on the land. While in prison, he had advocated just such a scheme in the &quot;Northern Star&quot; under the heading &quot;Letters to the Irish Landlords&quot;. In 1835, he had given notice of his intention to introduce a bill to modify the rights of Irish tenants moved in Parliament. He later said his bill would have sought
to compel landlords to make leases of their land in perpetuity — that is, to give to the tenant a lease for ever, at a corn rent; to take away the power of distraining for rent; and in all cases where land was held upon lease and was too dear, that the tenant in such cases should have the power of empaneling a jury to assess the real value in the same manner as the crown has the power of making an individual sell property required for what is called public works or conveniences according to the evaluation of a jury.

O&#x27;Connor considered that the &quot;law of primogeniture is the eldest son of class legislation upon corruption by idleness&quot;. At the same time, he was opposed to the state ownership of land:

I have ever been, and I think I ever shall be opposed to the principles of communism, as advocated by several theorists. I am, nevertheless, a strong advocate of cooperation, which means legitimate exchange, and which circumstances would compel individuals to adopt, to the extent that communism would be beneficial.

As well as re-invigorating the Chartist Movement, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s plans were a powerful answer to emigration schemes for working people. He declared that Great Britain could support its own population if its lands were properly cultivated. In his book &quot;A Practical Work on the Management of Small Farms&quot; he set forth his plan of resettling surplus factory workers on smallholdings of two, three and four acres. He had no doubts of the yields obtainable under such spade-husbandry.

He proposed a stock company in which working men could buy land on the open market. The land was to be reconditioned, broken up into small plots, equipped with appropriate farm buildings and a cottage, and the new proprietor was to be given a small sum of money with which to buy stock. Consideration was not given to the difficulties for town people, many who had never lived in the country, of becoming farmers. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s plan was built on the assumption that land could be bought in unlimited quantities and at reasonable rates, and that all subscribers would be successful farmers who would repay promptly.
O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Land Plan had its opponents in the movement, among them Thomas Cooper. On 24 October 1846 the Chartist Cooperative Land Company, later known as the National Land Company, came into being. A total of £112,100 was received in subscriptions, and with this six small estates were purchased and divided into smaller parcels. In May 1847 the first of the estates was opened at Heronsgate, renamed O&#x27;Connorsville. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s colleague Ernest Charles Jones wrote of this development:
&lt;poem&gt;See there the cottage, labour&#x27;s own abode,
The pleasant doorway on the cheerful road,
The airy floor, the roof from storms secure,
The merry fireside and the shelter sure,
And, dearest charm of all, the grateful soil,
That bears its produce for the hands that toil.&lt;/poem&gt;

The subscribers who got the land were chosen by ballot; they were to pay back with interest and ultimately all subscribers would be settled. O&#x27;Connor and Jones started &quot;The Labourer&quot; magazine to promote the project. Soon hundreds of working people were settled, and an outcry of opposition went up from the enemies of Chartism in the newspapers and in Parliament. Among the working people the Land Plan was very popular, O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s assertion that the land was theirs meaning a great deal to them.

In 1847 O&#x27;Connor ran for parliament and, remarkably, defeated Thomas Benjamin Hobhouse in Nottingham but the Land Plan ran into trouble. When he had taken his seat he proposed in &quot;The Labourer&quot; that the government take over the National Land Company to resettle working people on a large scale. Those Chartist leaders with whom he had quarrelled accused him of being &quot;no longer a &#x27;five-point&#x27; Chartist but a &#x27;five acre&#x27; Chartist.&quot; O&#x27;Connor replied to his critics at a meeting in Manchester but the political elite was moving to crush O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Land Plan, declaring it illegal.

In April 1848, a new Chartist petition was presented to Parliament with six million signatures. O&#x27;Connor accepted a declaration by the police that the Chartists could not march en masse with their petition from a mass meeting on Kennington Common. He made this decision to avoid bloodshed – he feared soldiers shooting down Chartists, as they had at Newport. An investigating committee in Parliament concluded that the petition contained not quite 2 million genuine signatures – it is unlikely, however, that the clerks could have counted this many signatures in the 17 hours they spent examining the petition.

On 6 June 1848, the House of Commons investigation found that the National Land Company was an illegal scheme that would not fulfil the expectations held out to the shareholders and that the books had been imperfectly kept.

A man under huge pressure, O&#x27;Connor began to drink heavily. In July 1849, the House of Commons finally voted on the People&#x27;s Charter, and rejected it by 222 votes to 17. In 1850 O&#x27;Connor once more made a motion in favour of the Charter, but would not be heard. The tragedy that was O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s story was nearing its end.

==Last years==

O&#x27;Connor quarrelled with his closest colleagues, including Ernest Jones, Julian Harney and Thomas Clark. The circulation of the &quot;Northern Star&quot; fell steadily and it lost money. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s health was failing, and reports of his mental breakdown regularly appeared in the newspapers. In the spring of 1852 O&#x27;Connor visited the United States, where his behaviour left no doubt that he was not a well man. It is possible (though we have only the evidence of the unreliable diagnostic methods of the time) that O&#x27;Connor was in the early stages of general paralysis of the insane, brought on by syphilis.

In 1852 in the House of Commons O&#x27;Connor struck three fellow MPs, one of them Sir Benjamin Hall, a vocal critic of the Land Plan. Arrested by the Deputy Sergeant-at-Arms, O&#x27;Connor was sent by his sister to Dr Thomas Harrington Tuke&#x27;s private Manor House Asylum in Chiswick, where he remained until 1854, when he was removed to his sister&#x27;s house. He died on 30 August 1855 at 18 Albert Terrace, Notting Hill Gate. and on 10 September was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. No fewer than 40,000 people witnessed the funeral procession. Most Chartists preferred to remember O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s strengths rather than his shortcomings.

==Family==
O&#x27;Connor never married, but had a number of relationships and it is believed that he fathered several children.

==Reputation==

According to Dorothy Thompson, O&#x27;Connor was the &quot;most well-loved man&quot; of the movement:For the chartists ... O&#x27;Connor was the acknowledged leader of the movement. Abler men among the leadership there certainly were and men with a clearer sense of direction in which a working-class movement should go, but none of them had the appeal which O&#x27;Connor had nor his ability to win the confidence and support of the great crowds who made up the Chartist meetings in their heyday. Over 6 ft tall—he was almost the tallest man in the House of Commons—and with a voice which could easily carry an open-air meetings of tens of thousands, with a handsome appearance, a quick wit and a rich vein of scurrility when it came to abusing his opponents, Connor possessed all the qualities of the first rate popular orator. 

Many of the early historians of Chartism attributed the failure of Chartism at least in part to O&#x27;Connor. He was accused of egotism and of being quarrelsome. In recent years, however, there has been a trend to reassess him in a more favourable light.
According to the historian G. D. H. Cole, O&#x27;Connor was inconsistent but a sincere friend of the poor. Important as that sympathy for working people was, there is more to be said in O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s favour. His resilience and optimism in his speeches, and in his letters in the &quot;Northern Star&quot; spurred on rank-and-file Chartists, who came to share his determination to keep up the struggle for their political rights. If O&#x27;Connor was egotistical, perhaps that is what a leader of the people, condemned and castigated by the aristocracy and the middle class and by their newspapers, needed to be.

The attacks on O&#x27;Connor by some on his own side are well-known. Lovett called him &quot;the great &#x27;I am&#x27; of politics&quot;; Francis Place said of him that he would use every means he could to lead and misled the working people. George Holyoake characterised as &quot;the most impetuous and most patient of all tribunes who ever led the English Chartists&quot;.

<doc id="451030" wikidata="Q10422716" url="?curid=451030" title="Auricularia cornea">
<text>Auricularia cornea, also known as cloud ear, is a species of fungus in the order Auriculariales. It is commercially cultivated for food in China. &quot;Auricularia cornea&quot; is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes and is also used in traditional Chinese medicine.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Auricularia cornea&quot; was originally described from Hawaii (Oahu) by German naturalist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1820. It was accepted as a distinct species by Bernard Lowy in his 1952 world monograph of &quot;Auricularia&quot; and subsequently confirmed as distinct by molecular research, based on cladistic analysis of DNA sequences.

Formerly, &quot;Auricularia cornea&quot; was often misidentified as &quot;A. polytricha&quot;. That species was originally described from the Eastern Ghats in India by French mycologist Camille Montagne in 1834, and is now considered as a synonym of &quot;A. nigricans&quot;. The misidentification remains widespread, at least in Japan.

==Vernacular names==
The species is one of several gelatinous fungi known as wood ear, wood fungus, ear fungus, or tree ear fungus, which alludes to their rubbery, ear-shaped fruitbodies. 

In Hawaii, it is known as &quot;pepeiao&quot; which means &quot;ear&quot; In Chinese cooking, it is often referred to as &quot;black treasure&quot;. In New Zealand, it is known as &quot;hakeke&quot; by Māori.

==Description==
Fruit bodies are solitary or clustered, ear-shaped, laterally attached to wood, sometimes by a very short stalk, elastic, gelatinous, pale brown to reddish brown, rarely white, up to wide and 2 mm thick. The upper surface is densely hairy and the lower surface is smooth. Microscopically, the hairs on the upper surface are thick-walled, 180–425 × 6–9 μm. The basidia are cylindrical, hyaline, three-septate, 60–75 × 4–6 μm. The spores are hyaline, allantoid (sausage-shaped), and 14–16.5 × 4.5–6 μm.

==Habitat and distribution==
&quot;Auricularia cornea&quot; grows on dead fallen or standing wood of broadleaf trees. The species is widely distributed in southern Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Pacific, and South America.

== Uses ==
100 g of dry cloud ear fungus contains 70.1 g of dietary fibre.

&quot;Auricularia cornea&quot; is usually sold in dried form, and needs to be soaked in water before use. While almost tasteless, it is prized for its slippery but slightly crunchy texture, and its potential nutritional benefits. The slight crunchiness persists despite most cooking processes. &quot;Auricularia cornea&quot; is coarser than &quot;A. heimuer&quot;, and is more likely to be used in soups rather than stir fries.

Māori traditionally cooked wood ear fungus by steaming in an earth oven and eating with sow thistle and potatoes. From the 1870s to the 1950s, the fungus was collected and exported from New Zealand to China. The white, unpigmented form is now cultivated in China. 

According to Chinese medicine practitioners, eating dried and cooked wood ear can have health benefits for people with high blood pressure or cancer, and can prevent coronary heart disease and arteriosclerosis. 

This fungus is used in Cantonese desserts.

<text>Woodford Green is an area of Woodford in East London, England, within the London Borough of Redbridge. It adjoins Buckhurst Hill to the north, Woodford Bridge to the east, South Woodford to the south, and Chingford to the west. Epping Forest runs through Woodford Green in the west of the area, north-east of Charing Cross.

It was a hamlet in the ancient parish of Woodford, in the historic county of Essex, becoming an urban district in 1894. For administrative purposes, this merged with the Wanstead Urban District to form the Wanstead and Woodford Urban District in 1934. In 1965, the urban district became part of the London Borough of Redbridge.

<text>The Early Cyrillic alphabet, also called classical Cyrillic or paleo-Cyrillic, is an alphabetic writing system that was developed in Medieval Bulgaria in the Preslav Literary School during the late 9th century. It is used to write the Church Slavonic language, and was historically used for its ancestor, Old Church Slavonic. It was also used for other languages, but between the 18th and 20th centuries was mostly replaced by the modern Cyrillic script, which is used for some Slavic languages (such as Russian), and for East European and Asian languages that have experienced a great amount of Russian cultural influence.

== History ==
The earliest form of manuscript Cyrillic, known as &quot;ustav&quot;, was based on Greek uncial script, augmented by ligatures and by letters from the Glagolitic alphabet for phonemes not found in Greek.

The Glagolitic script was created by the Byzantine monk Saint Cyril, possibly with the aid of his brother Saint Methodius, around 863. Most scholars agree that Cyrillic, on the other hand, was created by Cyril&#x27;s students at the Preslav Literary School in the 890s as a more suitable script for church books, based on uncial Greek but retaining some Glagolitic letters for sounds not present in Greek. At the time, the Preslav Literary School was the most important early literary and cultural center of the First Bulgarian Empire and of all Slavs:

The earliest Cyrillic texts are found in northeastern Bulgaria, in the vicinity of Preslav—the Krepcha inscription, dating back to 921, and a ceramic vase from Preslav, dating back to 931. Moreover, unlike the other literary centre in the First Bulgarian Empire, the Ohrid Literary School, which continued to use well into the 12th century, the School at Preslav was using Cyrillic in the early 900s. The systematization of Cyrillic may have been undertaken at the Council of Preslav in 893, when the Old Church Slavonic or &quot;Glagolitic Cyrillic&quot; liturgy was adopted by the First Bulgarian Empire.&quot;Unlike the Churchmen in Ohrid, Preslav scholars were much more dependent upon Greek models and quickly abandoned the Glagolitic scripts in favor of an adaptation of the Greek uncial to the needs of Slavic, which is now known as the Cyrillic alphabet.&quot;The earliest Cyrillic texts are found in northeastern Bulgaria, in the vicinity of Preslav—the Krepcha inscription, dating back to 921, and a ceramic vase from Preslav, dating back to 931. Moreover, unlike the other literary centre in the First Bulgarian Empire, the Ohrid Literary School, which continued to use Glagolitic well into the 12th century, the School at Preslav was using Cyrillic in the early 900s. The systematization of Cyrillic may have been undertaken at the Council of Preslav in 893, when the Old Church Slavonic liturgy was adopted by the First Bulgarian Empire.

American scholar Horace Lunt has alternatively suggested that Cyrillics emerged in the border regions of Greek proselytization to the Slavs before it was codified and adapted by some systematizer among the Slavs. The oldest Cyrillic manuscripts look very similar to 9th and 10th century Greek uncial manuscripts, and the majority of uncial Cyrillic letters were identical to their Greek uncial counterparts.

The early Cyrillic alphabet was very well suited for the writing of Old Church Slavic, generally following a principle of &quot;one letter for one significant sound&quot;, with some arbitrary or phonotactically-based exceptions. Particularly, this principle is violated by certain vowel letters, which represent plus the vowel if they are not preceded by a consonant. It is also violated by a significant failure to distinguish between /ji/ and /jĭ/ orthographically. There was no distinction of capital and lowercase letters, though manuscript letters were rendered larger for emphasis, or in various decorative initial and nameplate forms. Letters served as numerals as well as phonetic signs; the values of the numerals were directly borrowed from their Greek-letter analogues. Letters without Greek equivalents mostly had no numeral values, whereas one letter, koppa, had only a numeric value with no phonetic value.

Since its creation, the Cyrillic script has adapted to changes in spoken language and developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages. It has been the subject of academic reforms and political decrees. Variations of the Cyrillic script are used to write languages throughout Eastern Europe and Asia.

The form of the Russian alphabet underwent a change when Tsar Peter the Great introduced the civil script (, or , ), in contrast to the prevailing church typeface, () in 1708. (The two forms are sometimes distinguished as &quot;paleo-Cyrillic&quot; and &quot;neo-Cyrillic&quot;.) Some letters and breathing marks which were used only for historical reasons were dropped. Medieval letterforms used in typesetting were harmonized with Latin typesetting practices, exchanging medieval forms for Baroque ones, and skipping the western European Renaissance developments. The reform subsequently influenced Cyrillic orthographies for most other languages. Today, the early orthography and typesetting standards remain in use only in Slavonic. A comprehensive repertoire of early Cyrillic characters has been included in the Unicode standard since version 5.1, published April 4, 2008. These characters and their distinctive letterforms are represented in specialized computer fonts for Slavistics.

== Alphabet ==
In addition to the basic letters, there were a number of scribal variations, combining ligatures, and regionalisms used (for example, the additional letter ꙉ, which was used officially by the Serbians), all of which varied over time.

Versions of this initial alphabet where the letters ҁ and ѿ are omitted are also valid, since ҁ did not have a phonetic value nor an official placement in the alphabet with some putting it between п and р to correspond with the placement of the Greek letter ϙ and other putting it right at the end, and ѿ came later as ligature of ѡ and т.

Sometimes the Greek letters that were used in Cyrillic mainly for their numeric value are transcribed with the corresponding Greek letters for accuracy: ѳ = θ, ѯ = ξ, ѵ = υ, ҁ = ϙ, ѱ = ψ, and ѡ = ω.

== Numerals, diacritics and punctuation ==

Each letter had a numeric value also, inherited from the corresponding Greek letter. A titlo over a sequence of letters indicated their use as a number; usually this was accompanied by a dot on either side of the letter. In numerals, the ones place was to the left of the tens place, the reverse of the order used in modern Arabic numerals. Thousands are formed using a special symbol, (U+0482), which was attached to the lower left corner of the numeral. Many fonts display this symbol incorrectly as being in line with the letters instead of subscripted below and to the left of them.

Titlos were also used to form abbreviations, especially of nomina sacra; this was done by writing the first and last letter of the abbreviated word along with the word&#x27;s grammatical endings, then placing a titlo above it. Later manuscripts made increasing use of a different style of abbreviation, in which some of the left-out letters were superscripted above the abbreviation and covered with a pokrytie diacritic.

Several diacritics, adopted from Polytonic Greek orthography, were also used, but were seemingly redundant (these may not appear correctly in all web browsers; they are supposed to be directly above the letter, not off to its upper right):

:   &quot;trema&quot;, diaeresis (U+0308)
:   &quot;varia&quot; (grave accent), indicating stress on the last syllable (U+0300)
:   &quot;oksia&quot; (acute accent), indicating a stressed syllable (Unicode U+0301)
:   &quot;titlo&quot;, indicating abbreviations, or letters used as numerals (U+0483)
:   &quot;kamora&quot; (circumflex accent), indicating palatalization (U+0484); in later Church Slavonic, it disambiguates plurals from homophonous singulars.
:   &quot;dasia&quot; or &quot;dasy pneuma&quot;, rough breathing mark (U+0485)
:   &quot;psili&quot;, &quot;zvatel&#x27;tse&quot;, or &quot;psilon pneuma&quot;, soft breathing mark (U+0486). Signals a word-initial vowel, at least in later Church Slavonic.
:   Combined &quot;zvatel&#x27;tse&quot; and &quot;varia&quot; is called &quot;apostrof&quot;.
:   Combined &quot;zvatel&#x27;tse&quot; and &quot;oksia&quot; is called &quot;iso&quot;.
:   or &quot;payerok&quot; (U+A67D, U+033E), indicating an omitted &#x27;jerŭ&#x27; (ъ) after a letter.

Punctuation systems in early Cyrillic manuscripts were primitive: there was no space between words and no upper and lower case, and punctuation marks were used inconsistently in all manuscripts.

:   &quot;ano teleia&quot; (U+0387), a middle dot used to separate phrases, words, or parts of words
:   Full stop, used in the same way
:   Armenian full stop (U+0589), resembling a colon, used in the same way
:   Georgian paragraph separator (U+10FB), used to mark off larger divisions
:   triangular colon (U+2056, added in Unicode 4.1), used to mark off larger divisions
:   diamond colon (U+2058, added in Unicode 4.1), used to mark off larger divisions
:   quintuple colon (U+2059, added in Unicode 4.1), used to mark off larger divisions
:   Greek question mark (U+037E), similar to a semicolon

Some of these marks are also used in Glagolitic script.

Used only in modern texts

:   comma (U+002C)
:   full stop (U+002E)
:   exclamation mark (U+0021)

<text>Cunninghame () is a former comital district of Scotland and also a district of the Strathclyde Region from 1975 to 1996.

==Historic Cunninghame==
The origin of the name (along with the surname &quot;Cunningham&quot;) is uncertain. The ending is from Old English (&#x27;home, village&#x27;). The first component may be either Old English , (&#x27;king&#x27;) or Gaelic (&#x27;rabbit&#x27;). Irvine, a former capital of Scotland, was the capital of Cunninghame, indicating its status as a royal burgh. The family crest includes the unicorn, which is restricted to the Crown, and Clans Cunningham, Oliphant, and Ramsay.

The historic district of Cunninghame was bordered by the districts of Renfrew and Clydesdale to the north and east respectively, by the district of Kyle to the south over the River Irvine and by the Firth of Clyde to the west.
Cunninghame became one of the three districts or bailieries of Ayrshire, the shire or sheriffdom of Ayr. Cunninghame was in the north, along the River Irvine; Kyle was in the centre, along the River Ayr; and Carrick was in the south, along the River Doon. By the eighteenth century Ayrshire had become one of the counties of Scotland, with the three bailieries being described as &quot;districts&quot; or &quot;divisions&quot; of the county, although they had no formal administrative existence.

In the late nineteenth century the &quot;territorial division&quot; was described as comprising the civil parishes of Ardrossan, Beith, Dalry, Dreghorn, Fenwick, Irvine, North Ayrshire, Kilbirnie, West Kilbride, Kilmarnock, Kilmaurs, Kilwinning, Largs, Loudoun, Stevenston, Stewarton and part of Dunlop.

The Cunninghame poor law combination was formed in the 1850s with a poorhouse at Irvine but had a different area from the ancient district.
==Local government district==
The Cunninghame name was revived for a local government district created in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, which established a two-tier structure of local government across Scotland comprising upper-tier regions and lower-tier districts. Cunninghame was one of nineteen districts created within the region of Strathclyde. The district covered the whole area of three former districts from the historic county of Buteshire and nine former districts from Ayrshire, plus small parts of a further two districts within the designated area for Irvine New Town:
*Ardrossan Burgh
*Arran District
*Ayr District (part within designated area of Irvine New Town)
*Cumbrae District
*Irvine Burgh
*Irvine District
*Kilbirnie District
*Kilmarnock District (part within designated area of Irvine New Town)
*Kilwinning Burgh
*Millport Burgh
*Largs Burgh
*Saltcoats Burgh
*Stevenston Burgh
*West Kilbride District
Arran, Cumbrae and Millport were from Buteshire, the rest were from Ayrshire.

The district was abolished in 1996 by the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 which replaced regions and districts with unitary council areas. North Ayrshire council area was formed with identical boundaries to Cunninghame District. The name Cunninghame is still used for two constituencies in the Scottish Parliament, namely Cunninghame North and Cunninghame South.

===Political control===
The first election to the district council was held in 1974, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 16 May 1975. Political control of the council from 1975 was as follows:

===Premises===

The council was based at Cunnninghame House on Friars Croft in Irvine, which was purpose-built for the council and completed in 1975, forming part of the new town centre for Irvine following its designation as a New Town. Following the district&#x27;s abolition in 1996 the building has been the headquarters of North Ayrshire Council.

===Coat of arms===
The Cunninghame District Council was granted a coat of arms by Lord Lyon King of Arms in 1979. The main feature of the arms was a black &quot;shakefork&quot; from the arms of Clan Cunningham. To the left was the arms of the former royal burgh of Irvine, based on the crest of the royal arms of Scotland, and said to have been granted to the town by King David I. To the right was an ancient ship which had appeared in the arms of both Bute County Council and Arran District Council. Above the shakefork was a leopard&#x27;s head holding in its mouth a weaver&#x27;s shuttle. this represented the weaving industry of the inland parts of the district. Such an emblem appeared in Scottish arms grants to weaving societies and associations, and in the armorial bearings of the Worshipful Company of Weavers of the City of London. The motto was &quot;Sense and Worth&quot;, and the arms were completed by a gold coronet of a design reserved by Lord Lyon to district councils, topped by thistle-heads.

<text>Mink Car is the eighth studio album by They Might Be Giants, released on September 11, 2001, on the Restless Records label.

One of the band&#x27;s most eclectic efforts, its variety reflects its recording process; it was put together in a number of different studios, with a number of different guest artists and producers, around the country as the band toured between 1999 and 2001.

It runs the gamut from pure power-pop songs, such as &quot;Bangs&quot; and &quot;Finished With Lies&quot;, to dance music (&quot;Man, It&#x27;s So Loud In Here&quot;), and soft romantic ballads (&quot;Another First Kiss&quot;). The title track musically references Burt Bacharach (from cocktail piano introduction to horn interludes) whilst lyrically it offers an absurd take on lush lifestyles and dreamy music (&quot;I got hit by a mink car ... driven by a guitar&quot;). &quot;Man, It&#x27;s So Loud in Here&quot; was the only single released from the album, though its cover of the Georgie Fame oldie &quot;Yeh Yeh&quot; was featured in a Chrysler car commercial. &quot;Bangs,&quot; &quot;Cyclops Rock,&quot; &quot;Man, It&#x27;s So Loud In Here,&quot; and &quot;Another First Kiss&quot;, as well as &quot;Boss of Me&quot; (which was featured on non-U.S. releases), were released on the band&#x27;s 2002 anthology compilation &quot;Dial-A-Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants&quot;.

&quot;Bangs&quot; provided the inspiration for author Zadie Smith&#x27;s short story &quot;The Girl with Bangs&quot;.

A complete cover album called &quot;Mink Car Cover&quot; was constructed in 2011 to raise funds for the FDNY Foundation in the wake of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attacks that occurred on the day of the album&#x27;s original release. It featured covers by 19 different artists including Marian Call, The Doubleclicks, Hello, The Future!, and Molly Lewis.

==Track listings==
The track listing for the album varied depending on where it was released. Some releases featured bonus tracks, such as Boss of Me for the Australian release, and Your Mom&#x27;s Alright in Europe.

===Notes===
* &quot;Working Undercover for the Man&quot; was previously released in the EP of the same name.
* &quot;She Thinks She&#x27;s Edith Head&quot; is a re-recorded version of the track of a track with a similar name on Long Tall Weekend.

<doc id="451041" wikidata="Q1160961" url="?curid=451041" title="Aleurites moluccanus">
<text>Aleurites moluccanus, the candlenut, is a flowering tree in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It grows up to tall. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. The species epithet means &quot;from the Moluccas&quot;.

Its habitats include both Old and New World tropical rainforests and gallery forest. Although the nuts are mildly toxic when raw, they are of some culinary interest, with other parts of the plant having various regional uses.

==Description==
The candlenut grows to a height of up to , with wide spreading or pendulous branches. The leaves are pale green, simple, and ovate or heart-shaped on mature shoots, but may be three-, five-, or seven-lobed on saplings. They are up to long and wide and young leaves are densely clothed in rusty or cream stellate hairs. Petioles measure up to long and stipules about .

Flowers are small—male flowers measure around 5 mm in diameter, female flowers about 9 mm.

The fruit is a drupe about in diameter with one or two lobes; each lobe has a single soft, white, oily, kernel contained within a hard shell which is about in diameter. The kernel is the source of candlenut oil.

==Taxonomy==
This plant was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; (1753) as &quot;Jatropha moluccana&quot;. It was renamed as &quot;Aleurites moluccana&quot; by Carl Ludwig Willdenow in an 1805 edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;, but the ending was corrected to match the gender of the Latin genus &quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;.

While there are many online references to the name &quot;Aleurites moluccana&quot;, this is not a name accepted by botanic authorities such as the International Plant Names Index or the Germplasm Resources Information Network.

=== Etymology ===
The genus name derives from the Ancient Greek (), meaning &quot;flour&quot; or &quot;meal&quot;, and refers to the new growth which appears to be dusted with flour. The species epithet means &quot;from the Moluccas&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Its native range is impossible to establish precisely because of early spread by humans, and the tree is now distributed throughout the New and Old World tropics.

The candlenut was first domesticated on the islands of Southeast Asia. Remains of harvested candlenuts have been recovered from archaeological sites in Timor and Morotai in eastern Indonesia, dated to around 13,000 and 11,000 BP, respectively. Archaeological evidence of candlenut cultivation is also found in Neolithic sites of the Toalean culture in southern Sulawesi dated to around 3,700 to 2,300 BP. Candlenuts were widely introduced into the Pacific islands by early Austronesian voyagers and became naturalized to high volcanic islands.

&quot;A. moluccanus&quot; grows in tropical rainforests and gallery forests. It is a very fast-growing tree and often appears in disturbed rainforest. In Australia the altitudinal range is from sea level to .

==Ecology==
In Australia the seeds are eaten by rodents, in particular the giant white-tailed rat. The broken shells of the fruits are often found underneath the trees.

The larvae of the coleopteran &quot;Agrianome fairmairei&quot; feed on dead candlenut wood, and are considered a delicacy in New Caledonia.

==Toxicity==
Because the seeds contain saponin, phorbol, and toxalbumins they are mildly toxic when raw. However, heat treatment reduces the toxicity of the protein component. The &quot;kukui&quot; seed oil has no known toxicity and is not an irritant, even to the eyes.

== Uses ==
Both the nut and the oil that can be extracted from it are used. In Indonesia, the oil (candlenut oil) can often be found in hair care products. While mildly toxic when raw, the nut is appreciated in many cultures once cooked or toasted. In Indonesian and Malaysian cuisine, it is commonly used in curries, and on the Indonesian island of Java, it is used to make a thick sauce that is eaten with vegetables and rice.

Wealthier members among the Batak people have their coffins (Karo: &quot;pelangkah&quot;) made from the wood of &quot;Aleurites moluccanus&quot;, carved in the shape of a boat whose bow is decorated with the carved head of a hornbill, a horse, or a mythical beast known as a singa.

In the Philippines, the fruit and tree are traditionally known as &quot;lumbang&quot;, after which Lumban, a lakeshore town in Laguna province, is named. Before the intrusion of non-native species, it was frequently used as a property-line manager, because its silvery underleaf makes the tree easy to distinguish from a distance.

In the state of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, the Dusun tribes call the fruit &quot;godou&quot; and use it in tattoo-making as an optional ingredient for the ink.

A Hawaiian condiment known as &quot;ʻinamona&quot; is made from roasted &quot;kukui&quot; (candlenuts) mixed into a paste with salt. &quot;ʻInamona&quot; is a key ingredient in traditional Hawaiian &quot;poke&quot;.

In ancient Hawaiʻi, &quot;kukui&quot; nuts were burned to provide light. The nuts were strung in a row on a palm leaf midrib, lit on one end, and burned one by one every fifteen minutes or so. This led to their use as a measure of time. Hawaiians extracted the oil from the nut and burned it in a stone oil lamp called a &quot;kukui hele po&quot; (light, darkness goes) with a wick made of &quot;kapa&quot; cloth.

Hawaiians had many other uses for the tree, including leis from the shells, leaves, and flowers; ink for tattoos from charred nuts; a varnish with the oil; and fishermen would chew the nuts and spit them on the water to break the surface tension and remove reflections, giving them greater underwater visibility. A red-brown dye made from the inner bark was used on &quot;kapa&quot; and &quot;aho&quot; (&quot;Touchardia latifolia&quot; cordage). A coating of &quot;kukui&quot; oil helped preserve &quot;ʻupena&quot; (fishing nets). The &quot;nohona waʻa&quot; (seats) and &quot;pale&quot; (gunwales) of &quot;waʻa&quot; (outrigger canoes) were made from the wood. The trunk was sometimes used to make smaller canoes used for fishing.

As recently as 1993 on the outlying islands of the kingdom of Tonga, candlenuts were chewed into sweet-scented emollient used during a traditional funerary ritual. They were used for making various sweet-smelling oils for the skin.

In Australia, Aboriginal Australians used them for a variety of similar purposes.

In Fiji, this nut is called &quot;sikeci&quot; and its oil is used in cosmetic products.

In Flores near Ende, it is called &quot;kéloré&quot; and used as a mordant for dyes with &quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; (&quot;mengkudu&quot;).

On the island of Rapa Iti in the Austral Islands, fish hooks were carved from the endocarp of the candlenut as a result of lacking other suitable material. These fish hooks were quite small and were used for catching certain species of fish, such as &quot;Leptoscarus vaigiensis&quot; () and &quot;Stegastes fasciolatus&quot; ().

== In culture ==
The plant is also known by the common names candleberry, Indian walnut, kemiri, varnish tree, nuez de la India, buah keras, godou, kukui nut tree, and rata kekuna.

The Proto-Austronesian word for candlenut is reconstructed as &quot;*kamiri&quot;, with modern cognates including Hanunó&#x27;o, Iban, and Sundanese &quot;muncang&quot;; Javanese and Malay &quot;kemiri&quot;; and Tetun &quot;kamii&quot;, however the Oceanian words for candlenut is believed to be derived from Proto-Austronesian &quot;*CuSuR&quot; which became Proto-Malayo-Polynesian &quot;*tuhuR&quot;, originally meaning &quot;string together, as beads&quot;, referring to the construction of the candlenut torches. It became Proto-Eastern-Malayo-Polynesian and Proto-Oceanic &quot;*tuRi&quot; which is then reduplicated. Modern cognates including Fijian, Tongan, Rarotongan, and Niue &quot;tui-tui&quot;; and Hawaiian &quot;kui-kui&quot; or &quot;kukui&quot;.

The Malay language in both has another name given to the nut which is &quot;buah keras&quot; (literally &quot;hard fruit&quot;).

In Uganda, the seed is referred to as &quot;kabakanjagala&quot;, meaning &quot;the king loves me&quot;.

In Maui, the &quot;kukui&quot; is a symbol of enlightenment, protection, and peace. Kamapuaʻa, the hog-man fertility demigod, was said to be able to transform into a &quot;kukui&quot; tree. One of the legends told of Kamapuaʻa: one day, a man beat his wife to death and buried her beneath Kamapuaʻa while he was in tree form. &quot;Kukui&quot; was named the state tree of Hawaii on 1 May 1959 due to its multitude of uses. It also represents the island of Molokaʻi, whose symbolic color is the silvery green of the &quot;kukui&quot; leaf.

<doc id="451047" wikidata="Q1018157" url="?curid=451047" title="Portishead, Somerset">
<text>Portishead ( ) is a town and civil parish in the North Somerset unitary authority area, in the county of Somerset, England. With a population of 26,366 at the 2021 Census, the town is located on the Severn Estuary opposite Cardiff and Newport in Wales. The town is to the west of Bristol and 18 miles northeast of Weston-super-Mare and approximately 110 miles (180 km) west of London. 

Portishead has a long history as a fishing port. As a royal manor it expanded rapidly during the early 19th century around the docks, with supporting transport infrastructure. A power station and chemical works were added in the 20th century, but the dock and industrial facilities have since closed and have been redeveloped into a marina and residential areas. Portishead was also the telephone control centre used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as Portishead Radio. The headquarters of both Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Avon Fire and Rescue Service are in Portishead.
Portishead Lifeboat Station is situated close to the marina. Run solely by local Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) volunteers, it serves the waters of the Severn estuary and inland waterways into the city of Bristol.

==History==

The name Portishead derives from the &quot;port at the head of the river&quot;. It has been called &#x27;Portshead&#x27; and &#x27;Portschute&#x27; at times in its history and Portesheve in the Domesday Book, and was locally known as Posset.

The town&#x27;s recorded history dates back to Roman times, although there is also evidence of prehistoric settlement, including polished flint axe heads. There were also Iron Age settlements in the area, of which Cadbury Camp was the largest. Other sites that have been identified include a site that was successively occupied by the Romans, Britons and Danes. There is some evidence that it may have been the western end of the Wansdyke, an early medieval or possibly Roman boundary with a series of defensive linear earthworks extending to the Savernake Forest near Marlborough in Wiltshire.

After the Norman conquest the manor was held by the Bishop of Coutances and later reverted to the Crown, after which William II gave it to a merchant from Bristol known as Harding and then to his son Robert Fitzharding, who became Lord of Berkeley. The Berkeley family held it for generations until it passed by marriage to the Cokes of Holkham in Norfolk. In the 14th century it belonged to Everard le Frenshe. In 1621 the Bristol Corporation purchased large portions of land in Portishead and revived the Manor Court. The rights of the corporation over the manor were disputed, but they held it until 1836, when they sold it for £8,050. The parish of Portishead was part of the Portbury Hundred.

The town was built at the mouth of a small tributary of the Severn Estuary near the mouth of the River Avon. The old pill or jetty provided protection for craft against the Bristol Channel&#x27;s large tidal range, and iron rings can be seen in the high street at which fishing boats used to moor. Its position meant Portishead was used to guard the &quot;King Road&quot;, as the waters around the headland are called. In 1497 it was the departure point for John Cabot on the Matthew. A fort was built on Battery Point, and was used during the English Civil War when the town supported the Royalists, but surrendered to Fairfax in 1645. Guns were also placed at Battery Point during World War II. The King Road was the site of a naval action in 1758 when HMS &quot;Antelope&quot; captured &quot;Belliqueux&quot;, one of a French squadron returning from Quebec.

A mill was built on Welhay stream but this was replaced by tidal mills. In the 17th century the City of Bristol bought the manors of North Weston and Portishead for access to the channel and as a place to stay outside of the city and, in the 19th century, as a seaside resort. An outer sea wall was built, allowing the local marshes to be drained and increasing the land available for farming. The dominant architecture is early Victorian, with some buildings maintaining their original features. The expansion in residential property coincided with the construction of the dock, pier and the rail link to Bristol. The Royal Hotel by the pier was built in a Tudor Gothic style in 1830, to provide accommodation and catering for travellers on the steamers from Bristol, Wales and Ireland.

===Portishead dock===
The act of Parliament governing the enclosure of Portishead was passed in 1814, and stipulated the right to a public wharf, although there is historical evidence of nautical connections dating back to the Patent Rolls of 1331. Around the 1860s, at the height of the iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built by the Bristol &amp; Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. They brought valuable cargoes from across the globe and exported local products overseas. Ships carrying coal were commonplace in Portishead Docks.

In the 1880s Portishead Dock was acquired by Bristol Corporation, and was subsequently managed as part of the Port of Bristol until its closure.

===Portishead power stations===

The Portishead power stations were coal-fed power stations built next to the dock. Construction work started on Portishead &quot;A&quot; power station in 1926. It began generating electricity in 1929 for the Bristol Corporation&#x27;s Electricity Department. In 1937 its original six short chimney stacks were replaced by a high stack. A second stack was added when the power station was expanded in 1948.

Construction of Portishead &quot;B&quot; power station began in 1949; it became operational in 1955. The power stations became part of the nationalised electricity industry after 1949, and were operated in turn by the British Electricity Authority, the Central Electricity Authority and the CEGB. They used some local coal produced in the Somerset coalfield, which was delivered by train along the Portishead branch of the Great Western Railway (GWR). The line had opened on 12 April 1867 as the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company; it opened to the dock on 5 July 1879. The main supply of coal was imported by boat from Newport and Ely in South Wales; it was carried by Osborn &amp; Wallis of Bristol.

===Railways===

Portishead had two passenger stations on the GWR&#x27;s Portishead branch line. The main station was near the centre of the village of Portishead, as it was then; the other was at the pier. The construction of Portishead &quot;B&quot; power station caused the original railway station to be demolished and a replacement station was opened in the High Street on 2 January 1954. The new station closed on 7 September 1964.

The majority of the line was reopened in 2002, to transport goods from the Royal Portbury Dock. A new junction was created, from Portishead station, and a new goods line built from there to the Royal Portbury Dock. There is a campaign group aimed at reopening the station and the short stretch of unopened line. In 2009 a report by the Association of Train Operating Companies stated that the Portishead branch was a special case for future consideration for reopening due to the large projected increase in population and congestion in the area.

Portishead also had a second, short-lived, railway line: the Weston, Clevedon and Portishead Railway. It ran between Weston-super-Mare and Clevedon as a standard railway line, and between Clevedon and Portishead as a light railway. The Clevedon to Portishead extension opened on 7 August 1907. The line closed on 19 May 1940 and was then dismantled by the GWR.

===Albright and Wilson===
In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a chemical works on the opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5 megawatt electric arc furnaces (45 MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the decontamination included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.

===Closure of the dock and associated facilities===
The onset of new generating capacity at Pembroke (oil-fired) and Didcot (coal-fired) in the mid-1970s brought about the closure of the older, less efficient &quot;A&quot; Station. One generator (500 MW) of four at each of the new power stations had almost the same output of both Portishead Stations combined (&quot;A&quot; Station 200 MW, &quot;B&quot; Station 360 MW).

The newer of the two power stations (&quot;B&quot; Station) was converted to burn oil when the Somerset coalfields closed. The two Radstock pits ceased production in September 1973 and the last train load of coal departed on 16 November 1973. The price of oil rose steeply in the 1970s (see 1973 oil crisis and 1979 oil crisis) and the two power stations were little used after these events.

Portishead &quot;A&quot; power station was closed in 1976; and the first of its two chimney stacks, a landmark, was demolished in September 1981, followed by the second in August 1982. Portishead &quot;B&quot; power station closed in 1982 and both of its stacks were demolished in October 1992.

Industrial activities ceased at the dock with the closure of the power stations. The Port of Bristol Authority finally closed the dock in 1992.

===Modern marina development===

Much of the growth of Portishead&#x27;s population can be attributed to the development of the former docks. The former deep-water dock, used to supply coal and goods to the power stations, has been fully redeveloped into a modern marina with 250 pontoon berths.

The areas on each side of the marina, formerly occupied by the two power stations and chemical plant, have been redeveloped to provide a wide range of housing, from town houses to social housing to exclusive flats. Development has also completed on the Portbury Ashlands to the east of the harbour (so-called because they were the dumping ground for power station waste) extending the area of the town further towards Portbury.
Next to the Ashlands development lies Portbury Ashlands Nature Reserve.

This waterfront development is known as Port Marine. The area has varied styles of houses and apartments, including an area built in the style of a fishing village, which is modelled on the Cornish seaside town of Polperro with narrow streets and multi-coloured properties.

New waterside bars and restaurants, including Hall &amp; Woodhouse, Aqua, Bottelinos, Costa Coffee have opened around the marina as well as a nearby Wetherspoons.

At the top of the marina sits a new RNLI lifeboat station, opened in 2015 and run by around 40 local volunteer crew. An RNLI shop, open daily, is attached to the lifeboat station.

===Portishead Radio===
Portishead was previously the telephone control centre used by British Telecom (BT) for non-direct dialled calls to maritime vessels, a service known as &quot;Portishead Radio&quot;. This has now been largely replaced by INMARSAT, which permits directly dialled calls made from any BT landline in the UK. The radio station had separate transmitting and receiving stations. They were constructed by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company and operated by the General Post Office (GPO). By 1936, the station had a staff of 60 radio officers who handled over 3 million words of radio traffic per year. Following the privatisation of the GPO&#x27;s telephone network in 1981, the station was operated by British Telecommunications PLC (now known as BT Group PLC). The main transmitting station, which was remotely operated, originally consisted of a large array of radio masts at nearby Portishead Downs but was replaced by a single radio mast at Clevedon. It was used until the 1970s. The receiving station&#x27;s control centre and radio masts were located at Highbridge, near Burnham-on-Sea.

The radio station played a vital role during the Second World War in maintaining communications with the British merchant navy and with patrol aircraft in the North Atlantic. During the war, all communications with ships were one-way in order to avoid revealing the ships&#x27; locations to the enemy. The station was short-staffed because many were on secondments to various government services, such as operating other radio stations and training new radio officers to work in naval convoys. In 1943, the workload was so great that a Royal Navy officer and 18 telegraphists were brought in from HMS Flowerdown, a Naval Shore Wireless Service station near Winchester.

By the end of the 1980s, satellite communications had started to take an increasing share of the station&#x27;s business, and a programme of severe rationalisation began, leading to the closure of two transmitting sites at Leafield and Ongar. In the radio station&#x27;s penultimate year to March 1999, there were on average, per month, 571 radio telegrams, 533 radio telephone calls and 4,001 radio telex calls. In 1998, British Telecom Maritime Radio Services announced its planned closure of Portishead Radio. The long-range services (HF bands 3–30 MHz) ceased at midnight on 31 August 1999. The short-range VHF maritime band services (156–174 MHz) closed at 12:00 on Sunday 30 April 2000, and the medium-range services (MF maritime band 1.6–3.0 MHz) at 12:00 on Friday 30 June. The station closed in April 2000. The Highbridge station has been demolished. Sedgemoor District Council adopted a local development plan in September 2004 that included the site of the receiving station for future housing development. Planning permission was granted in October 2007 for a development of 190 houses and flats on the site and shortly afterwards the old radio station buildings were demolished.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Portishead, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Portishead Town Council and North Somerset Council, although the area below high-water mark, including the pier, is within Bristol. The town council is based at the Folk Hall at 95 High Street.
The police service is provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary. Avon Fire and Rescue Service has a fire station in Portishead staffed by retained firefighters, equipped with two water tenders each holding 1,800 litres. The South Western Ambulance Service has responsibility for the area.

===Administrative history===
Portishead was an ancient parish. Until 1892 it was governed by its vestry. In 1892 the more built-up part of the parish was converted into a local government district, governed by a local board. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894, which also said that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries. The part of the parish outside the urban district therefore became a separate parish called North Weston.

Portishead Urban District was abolished in 1974, becoming part of the Woodspring district of Avon. Woodspring subsequently became the unitary authority of North Somerset in 1996. A successor parish was created in 1974 covering the former urban district of Portishead. In 1993 North Weston was reunited with Portishead, with the enlarged parish being named &quot;North Weston and Portishead&quot; from the merger on 1 April 1993, with the order of the names being swapped two months later on 1 June 1993 to be &quot;Portishead and North Weston&quot;. The parish name was changed back to just Portishead in 2011, when the parish also gained some territory from neighbouring Portbury.

===Constituencies===
The parish is part of the North Somerset county constituency of the House of Commons. It has been represented since 1992 by Liam Fox, a member of the Conservative Party, who was Secretary of State for Defence and Secretary of State for International Trade.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
Portishead is a coastal town on the Severn Estuary. It lies north east of Clevedon and immediately south west of Avonmouth just across the River Avon, which forms the boundary between Somerset and Bristol. The city of Bristol is to the east and Portishead is approximately west of London. On clear days, Wales can be seen across the Severn Estuary from the town. The Eastwood area has been designated as a local nature reserve. It consists broadleaf woodland on a coastal limestone ridge which leads to Battery Point which had a defensive gun position and Portishead Point Lighthouse is on the promontory. There is also geological interest in the fossils, folds and faults found in the area.

The area immediately inland includes the Gordano Valley, which has been designated as a national nature reserve. The valley runs roughly north-east to south-west, between Carboniferous limestone ridges extending along the coastline between Clevedon and Portishead, and another ridge extending between Clevedon and Easton in Gordano. The area includes the villages of Clapton in Gordano, Weston in Gordano, Easton in Gordano, Walton in Gordano, Portbury and Sheepway. The M5 motorway runs along the south side of the valley, splitting briefly into two levels – the south-west-bound level running above the north-east-bound carriageway. The Gordano motorway service station is at the eastern end of the valley, near the Royal Portbury Dock and the Avonmouth Bridge. There is no river Gordano – much of the valley is reclaimed land barely above sea level, drained by ditches (known locally as &quot;rhynes&quot;). The rhynes previously managed by the now amalgamated Gordano Valley Internal Drainage Board are now the responsibility of the North Somerset Internal Drainage Board. An area comprising a total of has been designated as a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, for ornithological, entomological and stratigraphic interest, notification originally having taken place in 1971. Several sites in the valley are managed by the Avon Wildlife Trust as nature reserves. These include Weston Big Wood, Clapton Moor, Weston Moor and Walton Common. The name Gordano comes from Old English and is descriptive of the triangular shape of the whole valley from Clevedon to Portishead, being the ablative singular of the Latinised form of &quot;Gorden&quot; meaning &quot;muddy valley&quot;.

Denny Island is a small rocky island of , with scrub vegetation, approximately three miles north of Portishead. Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales, but the island itself is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire, Wales. The tidal rise and fall in the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. There has been concern about pollution levels from industrial areas in Wales and at the eastern end of the Bristol Channel; however, this tends to be diluted by the Atlantic waters. There are measurable levels of chemical pollutants, but little is known about their effects. Of particular concern are the levels of cadmium and to a lesser degree residual pesticides and hydrocarbons.

Portishead Pier to Black Nore SSSI is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest notified in 1952. The Portishead Pier Section is made up of alluvial sandstones, the best exposure of Upper Carboniferous rocks in the Avonmouth Coalfield. The cliff and foreshore exposures around Portishead Point provide important exposures of geological structures formed during the Variscan mountain building episode in the Carboniferous Period of geological history. Also included are important exposures of the Devonian sequence that yield several species of fossil fish. &quot;Holoptychius&quot; scales are the most abundant fossils, but teeth scales of other species are also relatively common. Notably amongst the collection from this bed are plates of arthrodires, including &quot;Groenlandaspis&quot;. Eastwood and Battery Point Local Nature Reserve is a woodland containing Yew, Maple, Dogs mercury and beech.
The Lake Grounds area, built in the early 20th century around an artificial lake, is the town&#x27;s main park. Adjacent to the beach and esplanade is a 100-year-old artificial lake, and a cricket pitch surrounded by sloping lawns interspersed with specimen trees. One of the UK&#x27;s few surviving outdoor swimming pools is situated on the shore next to the lake grounds and is open during the summer months. In 2009, the outdoor pool was renovated by a team filming for the American TV programme &quot;Ty Pennington&#x27;s Great British Adventure&quot;. Above the lake grounds is Battery Point, where a gun battery was sited to protect the Severn Estuary from invasion.

===Climate===
Along with the rest of South West England, Portishead has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 °C (50 °F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between 1 °C (34 °F) and 2 °C (36 °F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21 °C (70 °F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.

Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800–900 mm (31–35 in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest; the prevailing wind direction is from the south-west.

==Demography==

Portishead had a population of 22,000 in 2016, an increase of over 3,000 since the figure of 17,130 recorded in the 2001 census, with a growth rate of 40 per cent; which is considerably in excess of surrounding towns. As the result of a house-building programme, a further 8,000 people are expected to settle in the area by 2026, making Portishead one of the largest towns in North Somerset.

==Landmarks==
Court House Farmhouse dates from the medieval period but was remodelled in the 17th and 19th centuries. The Grade II* listed building is owned by Bristol City Council and in 2010 protests from local residents attempted to stop its sale.

The red brick National Nautical School was built by Edward Gabriel in 1905, at a cost of £30,000. Previously it had been based on the training ship HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; and operated until 1983. It is now part of a private gated community known as Fedden Village.

The remains of a former windmill, built in 1832 but disused since 1846, were rebuilt into a two-storey house and then, in 1908, incorporated into a golf club house. The building has since been converted into a pub. A small, disused, black village pump remains in Portishead with a strapped down handle.

The high Portishead Point Lighthouse was built at Battery Point in March 1931 by the Chance Brothers of Smethwick. The lighthouse is currently maintained by the Bristol Port Company. Black Nore Lighthouse was built in 1894, and was electrified in World War II. In October 2011, after it was no longer needed for navigational purposes, it was sold to a trust for preservation at a cost of £1.

The Royal Hotel in the area of Woodhill was designed and built to serve Brunel&#x27;s railway line which finished a few steps away from the Hotel. The original building survives as The Royal Inn pub. It was built in 1830 by the Corporation of Bristol (now known as Bristol City Council) in order to provide a hotel supporting the development of the seaside resort. It is thought to be the only seaside hotel to be built by a public authority during the nineteenth century. It is a Grade II listed building.
The Royal closed during the latter half of 2022 for upgrades and building works. It is set to reopen in the summer of 2023 as a hotel once more.

==Transport==

Transport links to Bristol and beyond have long been a concern for many residents. In 2000 a group was set up to campaign for the reopening of the Portishead to Bristol railway line. In 2009 the cost was estimated at £28 million, but by 2024 this increased to £182 million. Full funding was agreed on 10 Feb 2025 by local authorities and the Department for Transport, and the line is due to open in 2027.

The main A369 road — known after the historical name for the area as &quot;The Portbury Hundred&quot;, which links the town to the nearby M5 motorway — is prone to congestion, especially during rush hours. Major traffic-flow modifications have caused much controversy because they are widely seen as having caused queuing where none existed before. More than 4,000 residents signed a petition to North Somerset Council expressing concern at the development.

In September 2009 a trial was undertaken to turn off traffic lights in Portishead. It was conducted in association with North Somerset Council, Martin Cassini and Colin Buchanan. The change was made permanent after some journey times reportedly fell by over 50% with no measured reduction in pedestrian safety, despite greater numbers now using the route (over 2,000 vehicles and 300 pedestrians an hour).

Portishead is served by bus routes, including a half-hourly service to Bristol; as well as local buses to Nailsea and Weston-super-Mare. The WESTlink on-demand bus serves the town.

A lifeboat service has been operated by the Portishead Lifeboat Trust since 1996, but in 2015 this transferred to a new RNLI lifeboat station adjacent to the pier.

==Education==

The Unitary Authority of North Somerset provides support for 78 schools, delivering education to approximately 28,000 pupils. Infant and primary schools in Portishead include: High Down Infant and Junior, Portishead Primary, St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary, St. Peter&#x27;s C of E Primary and Trinity Anglican Methodist Primary School. Secondary education is provided by Gordano School. In 1999, the school was awarded Specialist Schools Technology College status (see awards). Gordano School enrolls over 2000 students annually, ages 11–19. The official opening took place on 12 July 1957. The school had cost £146,000 and still needed work to the playing fields. By September of that year, pupil numbers had increased to 500 and councillors were demanding more classrooms. The increase was attributed to the &quot;post-war bulge&quot;. In September 1975, £209,000 was allocated for new buildings. Gordano was named the &quot;Big Experiment&quot; as it became Somerset&#x27;s first comprehensive school, with 900 students and 30 teachers. The education department forecast the school numbers would treble by 1975. In 1994, an astroturf sports playing surface was laid at a cost of £260,000. Numbers had grown to 1,589 students and 88 teachers. In 2009 the school was awarded academy status. Much redevelopment of the site has since occurred - these include a new specialised sixth-form center, an English block, a new maths building as well as extensions to the Science, Creative Arts and Design and Technology Buildings. Most recently there has been a new sports hall opened this includes a new gym and indoor sports facilities.

As of 1 September 2016 High Down Infant and Junior Schools, Gordano School, Portishead Primary School and St. Peter&#x27;s C of E Primary School in the town, and St. Mary&#x27;s in nearby Portbury formed a Multi Academy Trust (MAT) called The Lighthouse Partnership.

Trinity Anglican Methodist School has become part of the Bath &amp; Wells Multi Academy Trust.

==Religious sites==

The Norman Church of St Peter (shown right) was built in 1320 and rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries in the Perpendicular Gothic style. In 1952 it was made a Grade I listed building. The four-stage tower is a prominent landmark, with set back buttresses and a pierced parapet. The church was altered in 1978–1979 and has a new garden developed for the Millennium.

The Chapel of Portishead National Nautical School (now The Fedden Village) on Nore Road dates back to 1911. It is dedicated to St. Nicholas and is also a listed building.

There is also a thriving URC church which dates from 6 March 1840. One of the early benefactors was Henry Overton Wills of the Wills tobacco family, who were staunch Congregationalists.

==Sport==
Portishead has a sports and leisure complex, which was partly funded by the National Lottery as well as by funds from the Town Council and North Somerset Council. It houses a large swimming pool, leisure and play pools, indoor bowls, six badminton courts, a gymnasium, a fun room for toddlers, a cafeteria and a licensed bar. Other sporting facilities in the town include open-air tennis courts, a large outdoor swimming-pool opened in 1962 (and renovated in 2009), a boating lake, cricket ground, football and hockey pitches as well as many cycle lanes. The cricket club dates back to the 19th century.

Portishead Town F.C. played in small regional leagues for years until joining the Somerset County League in 1975. They won the Premier Division title four times in five years between 1993–94 and 1997–98. After their fourth successive runner-up campaign in the 2004–05 season, Portishead successfully applied for promotion to the Western League. In Portishead&#x27;s first season of Western League football they finished in the top half of the table only to better their performance the following season. In 2006–07 Portishead achieved their highest ever finish in the history of the club, finishing runners-up to Truro City.

== Media ==
Regional TV news is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Bristol on 94.9 FM, Heart West on 96.3 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 107.2 FM and Hits Radio Bristol &amp; The South West on 106.5 FM.

The North Somerset Times (formerly known as Portishead Times) is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Culture==

The Bristol-based trip hop group Portishead took their name from the town, despite describing it as their &quot;dreary home-town&quot;. Chaos UK is a punk band that was formed in Portishead in 1979. The town was also the birthplace of leading Scrumpy and Western singer Adge Cutler.

There are various groups and societies in the town, including the Gordano society that is involved in history, conservation, environment, planning and wildlife issues; a horticultural society; and the Portishead Railway Group that is campaigning for the Portishead to Bristol railway line to be re-opened. There are also church and youth organisations such as the Portishead Youth Club - a choral society, which was formed in 1955 - and an annual carnival.

A public art programme started in 1999 from the marina development, as part of a planning agreement between the developers (Crest Nicholson and Persimmon Homes) and North Somerset Council. An art trail takes in 28 public art works around the marina and Ashlands development.

==Twinned towns==
In 1989 the town twinned with Den Dungen, a small town of approximately 6,000 inhabitants about from the city of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, capital of the Province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. Den Dungen was a separate municipality until 1996, when it was merged with Sint-Michielsgestel.

In 1992 a further twinning arrangement was made with Schweich, the principal town in a municipality of some 20,000 people, from the Roman city of Trier. This municipality is in the Trier-Saarburg district, in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is situated on the river Moselle, about northeast of Trier. Schweich is the seat of the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Schweich an der Römischen Weinstraße.

<text>Michael Ross Doughty ( ; born June 10, 1970) is an American singer-songwriter and author. He founded the band Soul Coughing in 1992, and as of &quot;The Heart Watches While the Brain Burns&quot; (2016), has released 18 studio albums, live albums, and EPs, all since 2000.

==Early life==
Doughty is the son of military historian and U.S. Army officer Robert A. Doughty. He grew up on army bases throughout the United States, including Fort Knox, Fort Hood, and Fort Leavenworth, and spent his teenage years living on the grounds of the United States Military Academy at West Point where his father taught. He came to New York City at age 19 to study poetry at The New School. Singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco was one of his classmates in Sekou Sundiata&#x27;s poetry course, &quot;The Shape and Nature of Things to Come&quot;.

==Career==

===Soul Coughing===
While a doorman at the New York club The Knitting Factory (in that era, a hotbed of avant-garde jazz), Doughty founded Soul Coughing. The band released three critically and commercially successful albums, &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; (1994), &quot;Irresistible Bliss&quot; (1996) and &quot;El Oso&quot; (1998). The greatest hits album &quot;Lust in Phaze&quot; was released in 2002. In 2024, a reunion tour was announced, spanning from September to October 2024.

===Solo career===
Doughty broke up Soul Coughing in 2000 due to personal problems: He was wearying of the band, and he was addicted to opiate painkillers, heroin, and alcohol. He was promptly dropped by Warner Brothers, and began traveling in a rental car (covering 9,000 miles on his first tour) playing acoustic shows. After shows he would sit at the front of the stage and sell copies of his acoustic album &quot;Skittish&quot; — then on CD-Rs in plain white sleeves. Warner Brothers had rejected the record in 1996. During his three-year tour, Doughty sold 20,000 copies of &quot;Skittish&quot; and gradually developed a following independent of Soul Coughing. Doughty collaborated with BT on &quot;Never Gonna Come Back Down&quot; providing lyrics and vocals. &quot;Never Gonna Come Back Down&quot; was contained on BT&#x27;s album &quot;Movement in Still Life&quot;, released in 1999.

He remained without a label until, when playing the Bonnaroo music festival in 2004, Doughty bumped into Dave Matthews, a longtime Soul Coughing fan who had the band open for him on two US tours, including shows at Madison Square Garden. When Matthews professed to be a fan of Doughty&#x27;s solo record &quot;Rockity Roll&quot; and the song &quot;27 Jennifers&quot;, Doughty gave him a CD with rough mixes of an album he had been working on in Minneapolis with singer-songwriter and producer Dan Wilson. Doughty had been introduced to Wilson through their mutual artist manager, Jim Grant. Matthews eventually released the album on his ATO label as &quot;Haughty Melodic&quot; (an anagram for &#x27;Michael Doughty&#x27;.) &quot;Haughty Melodic&quot;″s singles &quot;Looking at the World from the Bottom of a Well&quot; and &quot;I Hear the Bells&quot; were each featured on episodes of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; and &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, and Doughty appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, marking a return to the musical mainstream. He has since released a number of follow-up albums. Some of Doughty&#x27;s albums, including &quot;Circles, Super Bon Bon and The Very Best of Soul Coughing&quot;, &quot;Live at Ken’s&quot;, and &quot;Stellar Motel&quot;, have used crowdfunding to finance their creation. He has also used Patreon to release a song every week for those paying $5 a month.

In 2012, Doughty published a memoir called &quot;The Book of Drugs&quot;, covering his formative years as a musician, what he called the &quot;dark, abusive marriage&quot; that was Soul Coughing, and his experiences with addiction and recovery.

In 2014, Mike Doughty created a rock opera based on the Book of Revelation called &quot;Revelation&quot;.

In 2015, he moved to Memphis, Tennessee.

In 2019, Doughty mounted a U.S. tour in honor of the 25th anniversary of &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; in which he played the album in its entirety.

In May 2020, Doughty published his second memoir titled &quot;I Die Each Time I Hear The Sound: A Memoir&quot;, which he wrote to expound upon his musical tastes and how they came to be.

In August 2020, Doughty announced his new project &quot;Ghost of Vroom&quot; with longtime collaborator Andrew &quot;Scrap&quot; Livingston.

<text>Attalus III () Philometor Euergetes ( – 133 BC) was the last Attalid king of Pergamon, ruling from 138 BC to 133 BC.

==Biography==
Attalus III was the son of king Eumenes II and his queen Stratonice of Pergamon, and he was the nephew of Attalus II, whom he succeeded. &quot;Philometor Euergetes&quot; means &quot;Loving-his-Mother, Benefactor&quot; in Greek; he was so-called because of his close relationship with his mother Stratonice. He is the likely addressee of a fragmentary hymn by the poet Nicander which celebrates his heritage.

According to Livy, Attalus III had little interest in ruling Pergamon, devoting his time to studying medicine, botany, gardening, and other pursuits. He had no male children or heirs of his own, and in his will he left his kingdom to the Roman Republic, believing that if he did not then Rome would take the kingdom anyway and this way would avoid bloodshed. Tiberius Gracchus requested that the treasury of Pergamon be opened up to the Roman public, but the Senate refused this.

Not everyone in Pergamon accepted Rome&#x27;s rule. In 131 BC Aristonicus, who claimed to be Attalus&#x27; brother as well as the son of Eumenes II, an earlier king, led a popular uprising with the help of the Roman philosopher Blossius. He ruled as &quot;Eumenes III&quot;. The revolt was put down in 129 BC, and Pergamon was divided among Rome, Pontus, and Cappadocia.

<text>Filbert Bayi Sanka (born June 23, 1953) is a Tanzanian former middle-distance runner who competed throughout the 1970s. He set the world records for 1500 metres in 1974 and the mile in 1975. His world record in the 1500 m was also the Commonwealth Games record until 2022.

==Running career==
Born in a small village of Karatu, near Arusha, Tanzania, he had to run eight miles every day to and from school as a boy. His greatest moment was arguably the 1500 m final at the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, when he won the gold medal ahead of New Zealand runner John Walker and Kenyan Ben Jipcho. Bayi set a new world record of 3 min 32.16 s, ratified by the IAAF as 3:32.2, and Walker went under the old world record set by Jim Ryun as well. Third place Jipcho, fourth place Rod Dixon, and fifth place Graham Crouch also ran the fourth, fifth, and seventh fastest 1500 m times to that date. It is still classed as one of the greatest 1500 m races of all time. There was no jockeying for position in the race; Bayi led from the beginning in a fast pace and was 20 metres ahead at 800 metres, the other runners strung out in a line behind him.

In 1975, Bayi broke Ryun&#x27;s eight-year-old mile record by clocking 3:51.0 in Kingston, Jamaica on 17 May. The record was short-lived as Walker became history&#x27;s first sub-3:50 miler on 12 August of the same year, running 3:49.4 at Gothenburg.

It was hoped that the Bayi-Walker clash would continue but, because Tanzania boycotted the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, it never materialized. However, since Bayi was suffering from a bout of malaria shortly before the Olympics, he may not have been able to challenge Walker even had there been no boycott.

Bayi won a silver medal in the 3000 m steeplechase at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. He ran 8:12.5 behind Bronisław Malinowski.

==Later life==
After retirement Bayi has spent much effort in setting up the Filbert Bayi Foundation which aims to guide young sporting talent in Tanzania. It is based in Mkuza, about 50 km from Dar es Salaam. The complex also aims to educate young people about HIV and AIDS, plus ways of getting out of poverty. The foundation started in 2003. Bayi has also opened a Primary and Nursery school based in Kimara, as well as the Secondary school which is based in Kibaha. The schools have been partnered with Barlby High School as part of the Dreams and Teams project set up by the British Council/Youth Sport Trust. The school hosted students from Barlby High School in January and February 2008. Bayi is also a member of the IAAF Technical Committee and is Secretary-General of the Tanzanian Olympic Committee.

<text>The Dead Zone is a 1983 American science fiction thriller film directed by David Cronenberg. The screenplay, by Jeffrey Boam, is based on the 1979 novel of the same title by Stephen King. The film stars Christopher Walken, Brooke Adams, Tom Skerritt, Herbert Lom, Martin Sheen, Anthony Zerbe, and Colleen Dewhurst. Walken plays a schoolteacher, Johnny Smith, who awakens from a coma to find he has psychic powers. The film received positive reviews. The novel also inspired a television series of the same name in the early 2000s, starring Anthony Michael Hall, the pilot episode of which borrowed some ideas and changes used in the 1983 film.

In the novel, the phrase &quot;dead zone&quot; refers to the part of Johnny&#x27;s brain that is irreparably damaged, resulting in his dormant psychic potential awakening. When some information in Johnny&#x27;s visions is beyond his perception, he considers that information as existing &quot;in the dead zone.&quot; In the film adaptation, the phrase &quot;dead zone&quot; is that part of his psychic vision that is missing—a blank area that he cannot see. This &quot;dead zone&quot; refers to an outcome that is not yet determined, meaning Johnny can change the future.

==Plot==
After having a headache following a ride on a roller coaster in Castle Rock, Maine, schoolteacher Johnny Smith politely declines when his girlfriend Sarah asks if he wants to spend the night with her. As he drives home through stormy weather, he has a car accident that leaves him in a coma. Awakening under the care of neurologist Dr. Sam Weizak, Johnny learns that five years have passed, and Sarah is now a married mother.

Johnny discovers that he has gained the ability to psychically see aspects of people&#x27;s lives (past, present, and future) through physical contact. As he touches a nurse&#x27;s hand, he sees her daughter trapped in a fire. He also sees that Weizak&#x27;s mother, long thought to have died during World War II, is still alive, and how a pushy reporter&#x27;s sister committed suicide, hinting at abuse by his hand.

With physical therapy, Johnny relearns to walk but retains a limp and must use a cane. Sarah reestablishes contact with him, but she is torn between her love for him and her family. They eventually drift apart.

As news of his gift spreads, Sheriff George Bannerman from nearby Castle Rock asks Johnny for help with a series of murders. At first Johnny declines, but he eventually agrees to help. Through a vision at the crime scene, he discovers that deputy Frank Dodd is the killer. Before Bannerman can arrest him, Dodd commits suicide. Dodd&#x27;s mother shoots Johnny, before being killed by Bannerman.

Johnny moves to a different town and lives a more isolated life as he grows physically weaker due to his psychic abilities. Despite Weizak&#x27;s concerns, Johnny refuses further treatment. He tutors children, working from home. The wealthy Roger Stuart hires Johnny to tutor his son, Chris. Through Stuart, Johnny meets Greg Stillson, a superficially charismatic third-party candidate for the United States Senate, for whom Sarah and her husband, Walt, volunteer. Stuart warns Johnny that Stillson is dangerous.

Johnny receives a vision of Chris and two other boys drowning in a local pond during an ice hockey game. He implores Stuart to change his plans, but he refuses and fires Johnny. Chris, however, stays home and lives, while the two other boys drown. Johnny realizes he has a &quot;dead zone&quot; in his visions, where the future is changeable.

At a political rally, Johnny shakes Stillson&#x27;s hand and has a vision of Stillson as President ordering a pre-emptive nuclear strike. Johnny seeks out Weizak&#x27;s advice, asking, for instance, if he would have killed Adolf Hitler if he had the chance, knowing beforehand the atrocities Hitler would commit. Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost him his life, but is a worthwhile sacrifice.

Sarah and her family attend a rally for Stillson. Johnny also sneaks in with a rifle; he shoots at Stillson but misses. In the ensuing commotion, Stillson grabs Sarah&#x27;s baby and holds him as a human shield, which a photographer captures on film. Before Johnny can fire again, he is shot by Stillson&#x27;s bodyguard. Johnny touches Stillson&#x27;s hand and foresees that, after the photograph is published, Stillson&#x27;s career ends in disgrace and he commits suicide, thus averting the nuclear attack. Johnny lies dying as Sarah embraces him and tells him that she loves him.

===Development===
After King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; was released in 1979, Lorimar Film Entertainment began developing a film adaptation. Producer Carol Baum gave the book to screenwriter Jeffrey Boam and asked him to write a screenplay. &quot;I saw it had great possibilities and agreed to do it,&quot; Boam said. He developed a script with director Stanley Donen, who left the project before the film had reached production at Lorimar. Boam completed his first draft for the film on the same day as Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election as president.

Lorimar eventually closed its film division after a series of box-office failures, and soon after, producer Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. He initially disliked Boam&#x27;s screenplay and asked King to adapt his own novel. De Laurentiis then reportedly rejected King&#x27;s script as &quot;involved and convoluted&quot;; however, David Cronenberg, who ultimately directed the film, said that he was the one who decided not to use the script, finding it &quot;needlessly brutal&quot;. De Laurentiis commissioned another script from Andrzej Żuławski, but rejected it and returned to Boam. Cronenberg later questioned the quality of the script De Laurentiis read as it was initially written in Polish, translated to English, and then translated to Italian. The film was finally on track to be made when De Laurentiis hired producer Debra Hill to work with Cronenberg and Boam.

Cronenberg initially rejected De Laurentiis&#x27; offer to direct the film, but accepted the position after meeting Hill. Cronenberg received five scripts for the film, including one from King which he described as &quot;the worst one by far&quot;. Although Cronenberg did not write &quot;Fast Company&quot; he was involved in the writing process and made edits during film. &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; was his first film in which he did not have any involvement in writing the script. It was also his first film that did not have any Canadian content.

Boam abandoned King&#x27;s parallel story structure for &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;″s screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, &quot;King&#x27;s book is longer than it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it&#x27;s episodic. What I did was &quot;use&quot; that episodic quality, because I saw &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; as a triptych.&quot; His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel&#x27;s story, including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor.

Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam&#x27;s &quot;triptych&quot; in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said he enjoyed writing character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good. &quot;It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation,&quot; he said. In Boam&#x27;s first draft of the screenplay, Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this &quot;trick ending&quot; be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.

Boam stated that Donen wanted the film to be told from an outside point of view while Cronenberg wanted it from Johnny&#x27;s perspective. King is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story &quot;improved and intensified the power of the narrative.&quot;

Before Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, Bill Murray was considered for the role as it was King&#x27;s first choice. Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead. Cronenberg also wanted Hal Holbrook to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.

In addition to Donen, both John Badham and Michael Cimino were also considered to direct.

===Filming===
The financial failure of &quot;Videodrome&quot; occurred during the filming of &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. Shooting started in early January 1983 and took place in the Greater Toronto Area and the Regional Municipality of Niagara of Cronenberg&#x27;s native Ontario, Canada. The so-called Screaming Tunnel, located in nearby Niagara Falls, Ontario, was also used as the backdrop for one scene. The gazebo was built by the film crew and donated to Niagara-on-the-Lake. It was Cronenberg&#x27;s first film to utilize stereophonic sound.

According to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD, &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario, which lasted for weeks, creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero temperatures and icy, snow-packed terrain, which made for great natural shooting locations, despite it being almost too cold for cast and crew to tolerate at times. Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, a theme park 30 km north of Toronto&#x27;s city limits, was also used as a filming location.

===Music===
The music soundtrack, composed by Michael Kamen, was recorded by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, London, at the famous EMI Abbey Road Studios. Michael Kamen conducted the recording sessions; the orchestra was contracted and led by Sidney Sax. This is the only Cronenberg film since &quot;The Brood&quot; (1979) for which Howard Shore was not composer.

==Release==
The film&#x27;s premiere was planned for the Toronto International Film Festival, but three days before the showing Paramount removed it as the studio did not want negative reviews six weeks before the film&#x27;s theatrical release. &quot;Daniel&quot; was premiered instead.

Cronenberg criticized the film&#x27;s theatrical distribution and stated that it could have been number one at the box office had its distribution been better. The head of marketing at Paramount, David Rose, was arrested for embezzling money and Cronenberg theorized that Rose might have taken money meant for the marketing of the film.

Cronenberg showed his own Dolby stereo version of the film in Toronto for a month as none of the theaters were playing that version and broke even without concessions.

==Reception==

&quot;The Dead Zone&quot; received very positive reviews on release. It holds an approval rating of 89% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 54 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Dead Zone&quot; combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half stars, describing &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; as by far the best of the half-a-dozen cinematic adaptations of King&#x27;s novels to that date. He praised Cronenberg&#x27;s direction for successfully weaving the supernatural into the everyday, and noted believable performances by the entire cast, especially Walken: &quot;Walken does such a good job of portraying Johnny Smith, the man with the strange gift, that we forget this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as this guy&#x27;s story.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the film as &quot;a well-acted drama more eerie than terrifying, more rooted in the occult than in sheer horror.&quot; Robin Wood stated that it was the first film by Cronenberg that he could admire and called it a &quot;healthy development&quot;.

Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; was more critical of the film, describing it as &quot;By no means a bad film, just a disappointingly bland and superficial one ... in which director David Cronenberg relinquishes the one thing that had always set him apart from his Canadian colleagues: his willingness to follow his intuitions rather than the logic of a script.&quot;

===Box office===
The film grossed $20.8 million in the United States and Canada). Worldwide, it earned theatrical rentals of $16.3 million.

<text>Samuel Sewall (; March 28, 1652 – January 1, 1730) was a judge, businessman, and printer in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, best known for his involvement in the Salem witch trials, for which he later apologized, and his essay &quot;The Selling of Joseph&quot; (1700), which criticized slavery. He served for many years as the chief justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature, the province&#x27;s high court.

==Biography==

Sewall was born in Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, on March 28, 1652, the son of Henry and Jane () Sewall. His father, son of the mayor of Coventry, had come to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1635, where he married Sewall&#x27;s mother and returned to England in the 1640s.

Following the Restoration of Charles II to the English throne, the Sewalls again crossed the Atlantic in 1661, settling in Newbury, Massachusetts. Like other local boys, he attended school at the home of James Noyes, whose cousin, Reverend Thomas Parker, was the principal instructor. From Parker, Sewall acquired a lifelong love of verse, which he wrote in both English and Latin. In 1667 Sewall entered Harvard College, where his classmates included Edward Taylor and Daniel Gookin, with whom he formed enduring friendships. Sewall received his B.A. in 1671 and his M.A. in 1674. In 1674 he served as librarian of Harvard for nine months, the second person to hold that post. That year he began keeping a journal, which he maintained for most of his life; it is one of the major historical documents of the time. In 1679 he became a member of the Military Company of Massachusetts.

Sewall&#x27;s oral examination for the MA was a public affair and was witnessed by Hannah Hull, daughter of colonial merchant and mintmaster, John Hull. She was apparently taken by the young man&#x27;s charms and pursued him. They were married in February 1676. Her father, whose work as mintmaster had made him quite wealthy, gave the couple £500 in colonial currency as a wedding gift. Biographer Richard Francis notes that the weight of this amount of specie, , may have approximated the bride&#x27;s weight, giving rise to Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s legend that the gift was her weight in coins. Sewall moved into his in-laws&#x27; mansion in Boston and was soon involved in that family&#x27;s business and political affairs. He and Hannah had fourteen children before her death in 1717, although only a few survived to adulthood.

Sewall&#x27;s involvement in the political affairs of the colony began when he became a freeman of the colony, giving him the right to vote. In 1681 he was appointed the official printer of the colony. One of the first works he published was John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. After Hull died in 1683, Sewall was elected to replace him on the colony&#x27;s council of assistants, a body that functioned both as the upper house of the legislature and as a court of appeals. He also became a member of Harvard&#x27;s Board of Overseers.

Sewall entered local politics and was elevated to the position of assistant magistrate in the judiciary. In 1692 he was one of the nine judges appointed to the court of Oyer and Terminer in Salem, charged with trying those from Salem Town and elsewhere who were accused of witchcraft. His diary recounts many of the more famous episodes of the trials, such as the agonizing death under torture of Giles Corey, and reflects the growing public unease about the guilt of many of the accused. Sewall&#x27;s brother Stephen had meanwhile opened up his home to one of the initially afflicted children, Betty Parris, daughter of Salem Village&#x27;s minister Samuel Parris, and shortly afterward Betty&#x27;s &quot;afflictions&quot; appear to have subsided.

Sewall was perhaps most remarkable among the justices involved in the trials in that he later regretted his role, going so far as to call for a public day of prayer, fasting, and reparations. Following the dissolution of the court, the Sewall family was blighted by what Sewall thought to be punishments from God. In the five years after the trials, two of Sewall&#x27;s daughters and Hannah&#x27;s mother died, and Hannah gave birth to a stillborn child. What convinced Sewall of his need for public repentance was a recitation of Matthew 12:7, &quot;If ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless&quot;. Not only had Sewall&#x27;s home life been shaken, but in the years after the trials, the people of Massachusetts came to see them as the culmination of a generation-long series of setbacks and ordeals, notably the Navigation Acts, the declaration of the New England Dominion, and King Philip&#x27;s War. He saw this as a sign not that witchcraft did not exist, but that he had ruled on insubstantial evidence. He records in his diary that on 14 January 1697, he stood up in the meeting house he attended while his minister read out his confession of guilt.

In 1693 Sewall was appointed an associate justice of the Superior Court of Judicature, the province&#x27;s high court, by Governor Sir William Phips. In 1717, he was appointed its chief justice by Governor Samuel Shute.

Sewall died in Boston on January 1, 1730, aged 77, and was interred in the family tomb at Boston&#x27;s Granary Burying Ground. Sewall married three times. Hannah Hull, his first wife, died in 1717; two years later, in 1719, Sewall married Abigail (Melyen) Woodmansey Tilley, who died seven months later. In 1722, he married Mary (Shrimpton) Gibbs, who survived him. His nephew, Stephen, served as a Massachusetts chief justice, as did his great-grandson Samuel.

==Views and writings==

===Abolitionism===
Apart from his involvement in the Salem witch trials, Sewall was liberal in his views for the time. In 1700, he wrote and published &quot;The Selling of Joseph: A Memorial,&quot; a tract that made a biblically based case that slavery was unjustified and sinful. It was the first anti-slavery document ever published in North America. Written like a sermon, &quot;Selling&quot; argues that &quot;Liberty is in real value next unto Life: None ought to part with it themselves, or deprive others of it, but upon the most mature Consideration.&quot; Enslaving people of Black African descent was contrary to God&#x27;s design for the world because according to scripture, all humankind were &quot;the sons of Adam&quot; and &quot;of One Blood&quot; and had the same right to freedom. Freedom, including for Black Americans, Sewall writes, should be valued more than profit. Sewall further argued that it was inopportune to lament the “barbarous” enslavement in Africa of many of his fellow New Englanders, while keeping Africans in Massachusetts. His title refers to the biblical story of Joseph, son of Israel, whose brothers unjustly sold him into slavery, comparing the enslavement of Black Americans to Joseph&#x27;s own unjustified bondage. &quot;Selling&quot; propagates a segregationist perspective, and Sewall claims that Black Africans could not peacefully live among white New Englanders. Nevertheless, his argument against slavery is, at least according to one historian, a &quot;courageous… public stand&quot;.

Sewall had published &quot;Selling&quot;&quot;&quot; in response to learning that Boston judge John Saffin had refused to release a Black indentured servant named Adam and intended to perpetually enslave Adam. After &quot;Selling&quot; was released, Saffin issued a rebuttal arguing that social hierarchies were necessary and that enslaving Black Americans was divinely ordained. Adam was set free after a lengthy trial, but Saffin&#x27;s rebuttal held greater sway among Bostonians, and chattel slavery persisted in Massachusetts. &quot;Selling&quot; was only reprinted twice (one in the 1700s and again in 1863), and it became an obscure document. Sewall&#x27;s own nephew, also named Samuel Sewall, rejected his uncle&#x27;s arguments against chattel slavery and continued participating in it as a business.

===Women&#x27;s rights and other views===
His essay &quot;Talitha Cumi,&quot; first published in 1725, refers to the &quot;right of women.&quot; When the periwig became fashionable in New England, Sewall condemned the fashion vehemently, in contrast to Cotton Mather, who saw no reason why a Puritan should not wear a wig. Sewall&#x27;s journal, kept from 1673 to 1729, describes his life as a Puritan against the changing tide of colonial life as the devoutly religious community of Massachusetts gradually adopted more secular attitudes and emerged as a liberal, cosmopolitan-minded community.

==Cultural influence==
*&quot;The Crucible&quot; (1996 film): Judge Samuel Sewall was played by actor George Gaynes. Notably, he is the first judge to begin doubting the circumstances, and by the end of the film, he is asking his superior, Judge Danforth, to end the trials as he and the townspeople have tired of the deaths and executions brought on by the court.

<doc id="451069" wikidata="Q5471250" url="?curid=451069" title="Fort Greene, Brooklyn">
<text>Fort Greene is a neighborhood in the northwestern part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood is bounded by Flushing Avenue and the Brooklyn Navy Yard to the north, Flatbush Avenue Extension and Downtown Brooklyn to the west, Atlantic Avenue and Prospect Heights to the south, and Vanderbilt Avenue and Clinton Hill to the east. The Fort Greene Historic District is listed on the New York State Registry and on the National Register of Historic Places, and is a New York City designated historic district.

The neighborhood is named after an American Revolutionary War era fort that was built in 1776 under the supervision of General Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island. General Greene aided General George Washington during the Battle of Long Island in 1776. Fort Greene Park, originally called &quot;Washington Park&quot; is Brooklyn&#x27;s first. In 1864, Fort Greene Park was redesigned by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux; the park notably includes the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument and crypt, which honors some 11,500 patriots who died aboard British prison ships during the American Revolution.

Fort Greene contains many examples of mid-19th century Italianate and Eastlake architecture, most of which is well preserved. It is known for its many tree-lined streets and elegant low-rise housing. Fort Greene is also home to the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, which, for over 80 years, was the tallest building in Brooklyn. The neighborhood is close to the Atlantic Terminal station of the Long Island Rail Road and has access to many New York City Subway services.

Fort Greene is part of Brooklyn Community District 2, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11201, 11205, 11217, and 11238. It is patrolled by the 88th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 35th District. Fort Greene, a largely African-American neighborhood in the 20th century, has been significantly gentrified over the years, with the Black population decreasing from 41.8% in 2000 to 25.8% in 2017.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
In approximately A.D. 800, a gradual movement of Native Americans advanced from the Delaware area into lower New York, ultimately settling as part of the Canarsie tribe among 13 tribes of the Algonquin Nation. In 1637, Walloon reformed Joris Jansen Rapelje purchased of Native American land from Dutch West India Company in the area of Brooklyn that became known as Wallabout Bay (from Waal Boght or &quot;Bay of Walloons&quot;). This is the area where the Brooklyn Navy Yard now stands on the northern border of Fort Greene. An Italian immigrant named Peter Caesar Alberti started a tobacco plantation near the bay in Fort Greene in 1649 but was killed six years later by Native Americans. In 1776, under the supervision of General Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island the American Revolutionary War era Fort Putnam was constructed. Later renamed after Greene, the fort was a star-shaped earthwork that mounted six 18-pound cannons, and was the largest on Long Island. After the American defeat in the Battle of Long Island, George Washington withdrew his troops from the Fort under the cover of darkness, a brilliant move that saved the outnumbered American army from total defeat by the British. Although the fort was repaired in advance of an expected attack on Brooklyn by the British during the War of 1812, it thereafter slowly deteriorated.

=== 19th century ===

====Settlement====
In 1801, the U.S. government purchased land on Wallabout Bay for the construction of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, stimulating some growth in the area. Ferry service linking Manhattan and Brooklyn launched in 1814, and Brooklyn&#x27;s population exploded from 4,000 to nearly 100,000 by 1850. Fort Greene was known as The Hill and was home to a small commuter population, several large farms—the Post Farm, the Spader farm, the Ryerson Farm, and the Jackson farm—and a burial ground. As early as the 1840s the farms&#x27; owners began selling off their land in smaller plots for development. Country villas, frame row houses, and the occasional brick row house dotted the countryside, and one of them was home to poet Walt Whitman, editor of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; newspaper.
Since the early 19th century, African Americans have made significant contributions to Fort Greene&#x27;s development. New York State outlawed slavery in 1827 and 20 years later &quot;Coloured School No. 1,&quot; Brooklyn&#x27;s first school for African-Americans, opened at the current site of the Walt Whitman Houses. Abolitionists formed the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in 1857, and hosted speakers such as Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman and also aided in the work of the Underground Railroad. Skilled African-American workers fought for their rights at the Navy Yard during the tumultuous Draft Riots of 1863 against armed hooligan bands. The principal of P.S. 67 in the same year was African American, and Dr. Phillip A. White became the first black member of Brooklyn&#x27;s Board of Education in 1882. By 1870, more than half of the Black population in Brooklyn lived in Fort Greene, most of them north of Fort Greene Park.

====Crowding====
In the 1850s, Fort Greene&#x27;s growth spread out from stagecoach lines on Myrtle Avenue and Fulton Street that ran to Fulton Ferry, and The Hill became known as the home of prosperous professionals, second only to Brooklyn Heights in prestige. During the 1850s and 1860s, blocks of Italianate brick and brownstone row houses were built on the remaining open land to house the expanding upper and middle class population. The names of the most attractive streets (Portland, Oxford, Cumberland, Carlton, and Adelphi) came from fine Westminster terraces and streets of the early 19th century. By the 1870s, construction in the area had virtually ended, and the area still maintains hundreds of Italianate, Second Empire, Greek Revival, Neo-Grec, Romanesque Revival and Renaissance Revival row houses of virtually original appearance.

As Manhattan became more crowded, people of all classes made Fort Greene their home. The unoccupied areas of Myrtle Avenue became an Irish shanty town known as &quot;Young Dublin&quot;, In response to the horrible conditions found there, Walt Whitman called for a park to be constructed and stated in a column in the Eagle, &quot;[as] the inhabitants there are not so wealthy nor so well situated as those on the heights...we have a desire that these, and the generations after them, should have such a place of recreation...&quot; The park idea was soon co-opted by longtime residents to protect the last open space in the area from development.

However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; soon found that the area was too expensive for some, and that many in the area were penurious:

Focusing on a certain section of the east Brooklyn area defined as &quot;between Flushing and DeKalb Avenues, as far east as Classon Avenue and as far west as Ryerson, extending across Fulton Avenue,&quot; the Times item said the real estate boom has resulted in class conflict among a majority of the area&#x27;s longtime residents (identified as &quot;renters or squatters&quot;) and its new neighbors—middle to upper income homeowners (identified as out-priced Manhattanites attracted to the spatial wealth of Brooklyn and able to afford the high price of its grand scale Neo-Gothic brownstones.) The paper further explained the conflict as one that had existed for some time, evidenced perhaps by a letter to the editor of a local Brooklyn paper published prior to the Times profile. The author, a new homeowner, wrote:

Washington Park, renamed Fort Greene Park in 1897, was established as Brooklyn&#x27;s first park in 1847 on a plot around the site of the old Fort. In 1864, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, by now famous for their design of Central Park, were contracted to design the park, and constructed what was described in 1884 as &quot;one of the most central, delightful, and healthful places for recreation that any city can boast.&quot; Olmsted and Vaux&#x27;s elegant design featured flowering chestnut trees along the periphery, open grassy spaces, walking paths, a vine-covered arbor facing a military salute ground, a permanent rostrum for speeches, and two lawns used for croquet and tennis. The park&#x27;s success prompted the creation of the larger Prospect Park. At the highest point of the park, The Prison Ship Martyrs Monument and vault was erected in 1908 to house the bones of some of the 12,000 Revolutionary soldiers and civilians whose bodies were thrown off British prison ships and later washed ashore. The monument, designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, was the world&#x27;s largest Doric column at tall, and housed a bronze urn at its apex. Restoration work on the monument was completed in the late 2000s.

On April 24, 1888, the Fulton Street Elevated began running from Fulton Ferry to Nostrand Avenue, shortening the commute of Fort Greene residents, while also blocking light and adding street noise to residents facing Fulton Street. Elevated lines also ran along Lafayette Avenue and Myrtle Avenue.

=== 20th century ===

Fort Greene in the early 20th century became a significant cultural destination. After the original Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn Heights burned down in 1903, the current one was built in Fort Greene, and opened in 1908 with a production of Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; featuring Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar. At the time, BAM was the most complexly designed cultural center in Greater New York since the construction of Madison Square Garden 15 years earlier. Fort Greene also showcased two stunning movie theaters, built in the 1920s: the Paramount Theater, which was ultimately incorporated into Long Island University&#x27;s Brooklyn campus; and the Brooklyn Fox Theatre at the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Fulton Street, which was demolished in 1971. Built from 1927 to 1929, the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, one of Brooklyn&#x27;s tallest buildings, is located next to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Brooklyn Technical High School, one of New York&#x27;s most selective public high schools, began construction on Fort Greene Place in 1930.

The poet Marianne Moore lived and worked for many years in an apartment house on Cumberland Street. Her apartment, which is lovingly recalled in Elizabeth Bishop&#x27;s essay, &quot;Efforts of Affection&quot;, has been preserved exactly as it existed during Moore&#x27;s lifetime at the Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library in Philadelphia by the Rosenbach brothers, renowned collectors of literary ephemera. Richard Wright wrote &quot;Native Son&quot; while living on Carlton Avenue in Fort Greene.

During World War II, the Brooklyn Navy Yard employed more than 71,000 people. Due to the resulting demand for housing, the New York City Housing Authority built 35 brick buildings between 1941 and 1944 ranging in height from six to fifteen stories collectively called the Fort Greene Houses. Production at the yard declined significantly after the war and many of the workers either moved on or fell on hard times. In 1957–58, the houses were renovated and divided into the Walt Whitman Houses and the Raymond V. Ingersoll Houses. One year later. &quot;Newsweek&quot; profiled the housing project as &quot;one of the starkest examples&quot; of the failures of public housing. The article painted a picture of broken windows, cracked walls, flickering or inoperative lighting, and elevators being used as toilets. Further depressing the area was the decommissioning of the Navy Yard in 1966 and dismantling of the Myrtle Avenue elevated train in 1969 which made the area much less attractive to Manhattan commuters.

From the 1960s through the 1980s, Fort Greene fought hard times that came with citywide poverty, crime, and the crack epidemic. While some houses were abandoned, artists, preservationists and Black professionals began to claim and restore the neighborhood in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Herbert Scott Gibson, a resident of the street called Washington Park, organized the Fort Greene Landmarks Preservation Committee which successfully lobbied for the establishment of Historic District status. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated two districts, the Fort Greene and BAM Historic Districts, in 1978. Spike Lee established his 40 Acres &amp; A Mule Filmworks company in Fort Greene in the mid 1980s, further strengthening the resurgence of the neighborhood. From 1981 to 1997, this resurgence included the South Oxford Tennis Club, which became an important cultural hub. The Fort Greene Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and expanded in 1984. As a historically African-American neighborhood, the cultural revival in the 1980s and 1990s has often been compared to that of the Harlem Renaissance.

=== 21st century ===
The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the influx of many new residents and businesses to Fort Greene. While issues of gentrification are raised with the Black population steeply declining from 41.8% in 2000 to 25.8% in 2017 (according to the Furman Center at New York University), Fort Greene stands to others as one of the best examples of a racially and economically diverse neighborhood. Commentary in &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the neighborhood as having a &quot;prevailing sense of racial amity that intrigues sociologists and attracts middle-class residents from other parts of the city&quot;. &quot;GQ&quot; describes it as &quot;one of the rare racial mucous membranes in the five boroughs—it&#x27;s getting white-ified but isn&#x27;t there yet, and so is temporarily integrated&quot;.

The controversial Atlantic Yards/Pacific Park project to build an arena (later known as the Barclays Center) for the then-New Jersey Nets (now the Brooklyn Nets) and a complex of large commercial and residential high-rises on the border of Fort Greene and Prospect Heights garnered opposition from many neighborhood residents who formed coalitions.

In 1994 Forest City Ratner promised that the project, which would be funded by taxpayers, would bring 2,250 units of affordable housing, 10,000 jobs, publicly accessible open space, and would stimulate development within ten years. , four of the fifteen planned buildings had opened, but the deadline was delayed by about 10 years from 2025 to 2035.

Fort Greene and Clinton Hill was the focus of The Local, a blog produced by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in collaboration with CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. It relied on community participation with content written by CUNY students and members of the community.

From 2001 to 2011, it was home to a popular bar called Moe&#x27;s, frequented by journalists, artists, cooks, and people in the entertainment industry. It closed and was replaced by a new bar, controversially called Mo&#x27;s.

In 2015, a group of anonymous artists illicitly installed a 100-pound bust of Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, atop one of the four columns at the edge of the Prison Ship Martyrs&#x27; Monument in Fort Greene Park, using a permanent adhesive. It was removed the same day by Parks Department personnel.

<text>Bronisław Malinowski (; 4 June 1951 – 27 September 1981) was a Polish track and field athlete, who is best known for winning a gold medal in the 3000 m steeplechase race during the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow, Soviet Union and the silver four years earlier in Montreal. One year after his last Olympic appearance, Malinowski was killed in a car accident in Grudziądz, at the age of 30.

==Life and career==
Malinowski was born in Nowe to a Polish father Anastazy Malinowski, and a Scottish mother, Irene Malinowska (née Dowell). He was named after the famous anthropologist. Throughout most of his career he competed for Olimpia Grudziądz. His first international medal was the 2000 metres steeplechase gold at the 1970 European Junior Championships. In his first major senior competition, the 1971 European Championships, he broke the national 5000 metres record which was enough for the eighth place.

He finished fourth at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, but came back to win gold at the 1974 European Championships. The period between the European Championships and the 1976 Summer Olympics, saw a rivalry emerge between Malinowski and Swedish athlete Anders Gärderud. It ended with Malinowski taking silver behind the first-place Gärderud who won in a world-record time.
Although Gärderud retired from the sport in 1976, Malinowski faced a new contender, Henry Rono of Kenya, who set the new world record in 1978. Still, Malinowski beat Rono in a head-to-head race that same season. In the autumn of 1978, he successfully defended his European Championship in the 3000 metres steeplechase in Prague. The pinnacle of Malinowski&#x27;s career came during the 1980 Summer Olympics when he took gold in the 3000 m steeplechase race by steadying himself against front-runner Filbert Bayi.

Shortly before his death, Malinowski was considering moving to Scotland, the native country of his mother, because Poland was then politically restless. He died in a car crash on 27 September 1981 on a bridge in Grudziądz, which was later named after him. There is also an annual running competition held in his honour in that city, the International Bronisław Malinowski Run.

<text>Chau Say Tevoda (, literally: prolific grandchildren of a deity) is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia. It is just east of Angkor Thom, directly south of Thommanon across the Victory Way (it pre-dates the former and post-dates the latter). Built in the mid-12th century, it is a Hindu temple in the Angkor Wat period. It is dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu with unique types of female sculptures of devatas enshrined in it. The Buddha images have been interpreted to have been built during the reign of Dharanindravarman, father of Jayavarman VII, who ruled from Preah Khan of Kompong. The temple was in a dilapidated state with 4,000 of its elements lying scattered on the embankment and in the Siem Reap River. Many of these elements were used in the restoration work carried out by a Chinese team between 2000 and 2009 under a project sponsored by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The temple was reopened in late 2009.

==Location==
Chau Say Tevoda is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia just to the northeast of the ancient capital Angkor Thom&#x27;s east gate, directly south of Thommanon across the Victory Way (it pre-dates the former and post-dates the latter). It is on a road which has the Thomannon temple on its opposite side, from the east gate and to a bridge built with carved stones from temple ruins in the vicinity. The bridge is without a river flowing beneath it in view of the shifting nature of the course of the Siem Reap River.

==History==
Originally Chau Say Tevoda was partly built in the mid-12th century under the reign of King Suryavarman II. Further supplementation of structures was done under the reign of Jayavarman VII. Though the temple was built under Hindu kings during the 11th and 12th centuries with predominantly Hindu deities such as Shiva and Vishnu, representation of Buddha images was interpreted to have been built during the reign of Dharanindravarman, father of Jayavarman VII, who ruled from Preah Khan Kompong Svay.

The temple was reconstructed on the basis of about 4,000 elements of the temple that were found lying around at the site. This restoration was done by a Chinese team between 2000 and 2009 under a project sponsored by the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Features==
The Tevoda is built to a cruciform plan and linked to an entrance hall, similar to the Hindu temples built in India, particularly in Odisha. The temple has four gopuras or towers on the four cardinal signs with an entrance from the east through a raised bridge. The long hall, which links the gopuras and central chamber of the temple, has very elegant flower decorations. The temple consists of a central tower with an attached mandapa, which is achieved through an antarala chamber of small size, and with two libraries on its southern and northern sides.

It is enclosed by a compound wall which has four gopuras or towers. To its east, there is a raised causeway that leads to the Siem Reap River. Many of the sculptures depict Vishnu and are in a fairly good condition. However, the main deity of the temple is Shiva. Some of the sculptures are also of Buddha but disfigured totally. With time the ceiling has collapsed and led to further deterioration. The defaced Buddhas, which are deified in a lotus posture, flanked by devotees, are in a mandapa behind a pediment from the entrance door which leads to the antarala.

The incomplete eastern Gopura I, which is oriented in the western direction, has a roof which is part of the second &quot;pediment of the lateral southern extension&quot; which is not fully restored. The main figure here is of Buddha in a cross legged posture seated on a high platform flanked by disfigured carvings which are interpreted as that of Garuda and the king of Nagas. The top pediment of this Gopura I with figure of Buddha has an umbrella cover of a Bodhi tree. Carvings depicting episodes from the life of Buddha are seen on the northern door of the eastern Gopura I. A notable bass relief here is of Sita (heroine of the epic Ramayana) in a seated posture over an altar flanked by &quot;rakshasis&quot; (female demonesses). Hanuman, in a small monkey form, is carved in sitting posture facing Sita and offering her Rama&#x27;s ring. A wall built with laterite stones enclosing the temple, which had existed in the past, has disappeared.

The temple was in a dilapidated state with 4,000 of its elements lying scattered on the embankment and in the Siem Reap River. Between 2000 and 2009 some of these elements were put together under a restoration project initiated by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The temple reopened in late 2009 and is fully accessible.

<text>Thommanon () is one of a pair of Hindu temples built during the reign of Suryavarman II (1113–1150) at Angkor, Cambodia. This small and elegant temple is east of the Gate of Victory of Angkor Thom and north of Chau Say Tevoda. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, inscribed by UNESCO in 1992 titled Angkor. The temple is dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu.

==History==

Scholars studying the carvings of the devatas in Thommanon have concluded that it was built around the time when work on Angkor Wat was begun. However, there is some disagreement as to the precise date it was built. Some believe that the distinctive carvings of females, known as devatas, indicate that they were built during the reign of Jayavarman VI (1080–1113 AD), some time at the end of the 11th century. However, there is greater agreement, especially given the scholarly studies, that it was built by Suryavarman II around the time of Angkor Wat and Beng Mealea from 1113 to 1150 AD.

The Vaishnavite cult was adopted in Cambodia by Suryavarman II and the shaivite cult of Linga worship was subsumed with the Vaishnavite cult in the temples such as the Thommannon, Beng Mealea, Chau Say Tevoda, Banteay Samre, and Angkor Wat.

Thommanon is directly opposite the Chau Say Tevoda and just 500 metres east of the Victory Gate on the way to Ta Keo. In the 1960s, the temple underwent a full restoration, funded by the École française d&#x27;Extrême-Orient (EFEO). French archaeologists restored it and added concrete ceilings.

==Structure==

Thommanon is a single-towered temple with an east-facing central sanctuary, crowned by a &quot;prasat&quot;, or tower. Access from the east is via a gopura, followed by a mandapa, or antechamber, before arriving at the central sanctuary.

The temple&#x27;s carvings are very well preserved and the aged sandstone provides a distinct contrast to the surrounding jungle. The architectural style of its tower is akin to the Angkor Wat temple and the Chau Say Tevoda in its vicinity.

Thommanon is better preserved than Chau Say Tevoda, though they are similar in design. The reason for better preservation of Thommanon is attributed to the fact that its superstructure does not have stone-enclosed wood beams. Thus, adoption of sandstone as the medium for carvings in this temple has made it more advanced in its architectural design vis-à-vis other temples in its vicinity, which were mostly wood-based. All doorways include carved pediments.

The compound walls around the temple have all disappeared, leaving only the entry gates on the east and the west. The central tower is all that remains of the main temple. It is inferred that Thommanon and Chau Say Thavoda were interlinked to the central tower under one large compound with large gates. The independent building separated from the main temple was the library.

===Devatas===
Images of devatas, the female divine carved figurines, are seen in profusion here, as in other Khmer temples. They are the centre of attraction in Thommanon. The devatas depict flower crowns, sampots (Cambodian skirts), necklaces, armbands, belts and ankle bands.

The mudras displayed are complex. The devatas grip the flower very distinctively, holding the ring and middle fingers against the thumb, while the index and small finger are extended. One Angkor researcher calls this position the &quot;devata mudra&quot; and notes it is also prominent at Angkor Wat.

The sampots of the devatas are divided into two types: one is the ancient pleated style, seen in the Bakheng period at Lolei and Phnom Bok (900 AD), and the other is a patterned fabric style with folds and &quot;tail&quot; seen at Angkor Wat.

<text>Baksei Chamkrong (; , , ) is a small Buddhist Temple located in the Angkor complex (Siem Reap, Cambodia). It is dedicated to Buddha and used to hold a golden image of him. The temple can be seen on the left side when entering Angkor Thom at the southern gate. It was dedicated to Yasovarman by his son, King Harshavarman I. The temple was completed by Rajendravarman II (944–968).

==Name==
The name &quot;Baksei Chamkrong&quot; means &quot;The Bird Who Shelters Under Its Wings&quot; and comes from a legend. In it, the king tried to flee Angkor during a siege and then a huge bird landed and sheltered him under its wings.

==Description==
This temple is one of the first temples constructed of durable material such as bricks and laterite and with decoration in sandstone. A brick enclosure originally surrounded the pyramid with a stone gopura on the east side is now almost completely disappeared. Much of the stucco on the surface of the temple has vanished. The main sandstone lintel is decorated with a fine carving of Indra standing on his three-headed elephant Airavata. Garlands emanate from either side of Indra in the style current to the monument. There is an inscription on either side of the small doorway which detail the dedication and praises the early Khmer kings from Jayavarman II onward as well as earlier legendary kings, including the ancestor of the nation, the hermit Kambu.

The pyramid measures 27 metres across at the base and 15 at the summit for an overall height of 13 metres. Four stairway reach the summit at the cardinal points. The brick sanctuary tower, eight meters square on a sandstone base open to the east with the usual blind doors on the other sides.

<text>Phimeanakas (, &quot;Prasat Phimean Akas&quot;, &#x27;celestial temple&#x27;) or Vimeanakas (, &quot;Prasat Vimean Akas&quot;) at Angkor, Cambodia, is a Hindu temple in the Khleang style, built at the end of the 10th century, during the reign of Rajendravarman (from 941 to 968), then completed by Suryavarman I in the shape of a three tier pyramid as a Hindu temple. On top of the pyramid there was a tower, while on the edge of top platform there are galleries. Phimeanakas is located inside the walled enclosure of the Royal Palace of Angkor Thom north of Baphuon.

== Description ==
The temple was the centrepiece of Suryavarman I&#x27;s capital. The buildings there from his reign are enclosed by a wall 600 by 250 m, with five gopuram, and include the Southern and Northern Khleangs.

The tower was originally crowned with a golden pinnacle, as Zhou Daguan described it in &quot;The Customs of Cambodia&quot;, written in 1297 CE. According to legend, kings spent the first watch of every night with a woman thought to represent a Nāga in the tower, and during this time not even a queen could intrude. Only in the second watch did the king return to his palace with the queen. If the nāga (considered the supreme landowner of the Khmer realm) did not appear for a night, the king&#x27;s days would be numbered; if the king did not visit her, calamity would strike the land.

One of the stele states Jayavarman VII, while on a military expedition in Champa, learned that his father Dharanindravarman II had died, and “returned in great haste to aid King Yasovarman II. His second wife, Indradevi, “...composed in impeccable Sanskrit the inscription...panegyric of her sister” Jayarajadevi, which included biographical detail of Jayavarman VII.

<text>Neak Pean (or Neak Poan) (, &quot;the entwined serpents&quot;) at Angkor, Cambodia is an artificial island with a Mahayana Buddhist temple on a circular island in Jayatataka Baray, which was associated with Preah Khan temple, built during the reign of King Jayavarman VII. It is the &quot;Mebon&quot; of the Preah Khan baray (the &quot;Jayatataka&quot; of the inscription).

== Etymology ==
Some historians believe that Neak Pean represents Anavatapta, a mythical lake in the Himalayas whose waters are thought to cure all illness. The name is derived from the sculptures of snakes (Nāga) running around the base of the temple structure, &quot;neak&quot; being the Khmer rendering of the Sanskrit &quot;naga&quot;. &quot;They are Nanda and Upananda, two nagas traditionally associated with Lake Anavatapta.&quot;

== History ==
Neak Pean was originally designed for medical purposes (the ancients believed that going into these pools would balance the elements in the bather, thus curing disease); it is one of the many hospitals that Jayavarman VII built. It is based on the ancient Hindu belief of balance. Four connected pools represent Water, Earth, Fire and Wind. Each is connected to the central water source, the main tank, by a stone conduit &quot;presided over by one of Four Great Animals (&quot;maha ajaneya pasu&quot;) namely Elephant, Bull, Horse, and Lion, corresponding to the north, east, south, and west quarters...The stone conduits in the little pavilions are fashioned to represent the heads of the Four Great Animals...the only exception being that on the east, which represents a human head instead of a bull&#x27;s.&quot; Originally, four sculptures stood on the floor of the lake. The only remaining statue is that of the horse Balaha, a form of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, saving sailors from the ogresses of Tamradvipa. The temple on the lake was originally dedicated to Avalokitesvara. Willetts believed that &quot;this is Jayavarman as he would have wished to have appeared to his people&quot;

Zhou Daguan refers to Neak Pean in his visit to Angkor in the late 13th century.

<text>Preah Khan (; &quot;Royal Sword&quot;) is a temple at Angkor, Cambodia, built in the 12th century for King Jayavarman VII to honor his father. It is located northeast of Angkor Thom and just west of the Jayatataka baray, with which it was associated. It was the centre of a substantial organisation, with almost 100,000 officials and servants. The temple is flat in design, with a basic plan of successive rectangular galleries around a Buddhist sanctuary complicated by Hindu satellite temples and numerous later additions. Like the nearby Ta Prohm, Preah Khan has been left largely unrestored, with numerous trees and other vegetation growing among the ruins.

== History ==
Preah Khan was built on the site of Jayavarman VII&#x27;s victory over the invading Chams in 1191 . Unusually the modern name, meaning &quot;holy sword&quot;, is derived from the meaning of the original—&quot;Nagara Jayasri&quot; (holy city of victory). The site may previously have been occupied by the royal palaces of Yasovarman II and Tribhuvanadityavarman. The temple&#x27;s foundation stela has provided considerable information about the history and administration of the site: the main image, of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara in the form of the king&#x27;s father, was dedicated in 1191 (the king&#x27;s mother had earlier been commemorated in the same way at Ta Prohm). 430 other deities also had shrines on the site, each of which received an allotment of food, clothing, perfume and even mosquito nets; the wealth and treasure of this ruin includes gold, silver, gems, 112,300 pearls and a cow with gilded horns. The institution combined the roles of city, temple and Buddhist university: there were 97,840 attendants and servants, including 1000 dancers and 1000 teachers.

Preah Khan experienced a slow decline because the Khmer royalty stopped supporting it around the 15th century. As support from the royal family dwindled, it became difficult to maintain and use the complex. Despite this decline, certain sections of the site continued to be used for religious or cultural activities.

The temple is still largely unrestored: the initial clearing was from 1927 to 1932, and partial anastylosis was carried out in 1939. Since then free-standing statues have been removed for safe-keeping, and there has been further consolidation and restoration work. Throughout, the conservators have attempted to balance restoration and maintenance of the wild condition in which the temple was discovered: one of them, Maurice Glaize, wrote that;
The temple was previously overrun with a particularly voracious vegetation and quite ruined, presenting only chaos. Clearing works were undertaken with a constant respect for the large trees which give the composition a pleasing presentation without constituting any immediate danger. At the same time, some partial anastylosis has revived various buildings found in a sufficient state of preservation and presenting some special interest in their architecture or decoration.
Since 1991, the site has been maintained by the World Monuments Fund. It has continued the cautious approach to restoration, believing that to go further would involve too much guesswork, and prefers to respect the ruined nature of the temple. One of its former employees has said, &quot;We&#x27;re basically running a glorified maintenance program. We&#x27;re not prepared to falsify history&quot;. It has therefore limited itself primarily to stabilisation work on the fourth eastern gopura, the House of Fire and the Hall of Dancers.

==The site==

The outer wall of Preah Khan is of laterite, and bears 72 garudas holding nagas, at 50 m intervals. Surrounded by a moat, it measures 800 by 700 m and encloses an area of . To the east of Preah Khan is a landing stage on the edge of the Jayatataka baray, which measures . This also allowed access to the temple of Neak Pean in the centre of the baray. Once dried up, the Jayatataka baray is now filled with water again, as at the end of each rainy season, all excess water in the area is diverted into it.

As usual Preah Khan is oriented toward the east, so this was the main entrance, but there are others at each of the cardinal points. Each entrance has a causeway over the moat with nāga-carrying devas and asuras similar to those at Angkor Thom; Glaize considered this an indication that the city element of Preah Khan was more significant than those of Ta Prohm or Banteay Kdei.

Halfway along the path leading to the third enclosure, on the north side, is a House of Fire (or &quot;Dharmasala&quot;) similar to Ta Prohm&#x27;s. The remainder of the fourth enclosure, now forested, was originally occupied by the city; as this was built of perishable materials it has not survived. The third enclosure wall is . In front of the third gopura is a cruciform terrace. The gopura itself is on a large scale, with three towers in the centre and two flanking pavilions. Between the southern two towers were two celebrated silk-cotton trees, of which Glaize wrote, &quot;resting on the vault itself of the gallery, [they] frame its openings and brace the stones in substitute for pillars in a caprice of nature that is as fantastic as it is perilous.&quot; One of the trees is now dead, although the roots have been left in place. The trees may need to be removed to prevent their damaging the structure. On the far side of the temple, the third western gopura has pediments of a chess game and the Battle of Lanka, and two guardian dvarapalas to the west.

West of the third eastern gopura, on the main axis is a Hall of Dancers. The walls are decorated with apsaras; Buddha images in niches above them were systematically destroyed during the reign Jayavarman VIII. North of the Hall of Dancers is a two-storeyed structure with round columns. No other examples of this form survive at Angkor, although there are traces of similar buildings at Ta Prohm and Banteay Kdei. Freeman and Jacques speculate that this may have been a granary. Occupying the rest of the third enclosure are ponds (now dry) in each corner, and satellite temples to the north, south and west. While the main temple was Buddhist, these three are dedicated to Shiva, previous kings and queens, and Vishnu respectively. They are notable chiefly for their pediments: on the northern temple, Vishnu reclining to the west and the Hindu trinity of Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma to the east; on the western temple, Krishna raising Mount Govardhana to the west.

Connecting the Hall of Dancers and the wall of the second enclosure is a courtyard containing two libraries. The second eastern gopura projects into this courtyard; it is one of the few Angkorian gopuras with significant internal decoration, with garudas on the corners of the cornices. Buddha images on the columns were changed into hermits under Jayavarman VIII.

Between the second enclosure wall () and the first enclosure wall () on the eastern side is a row of later additions which impede access and hide some of the original decoration. The first enclosure is, as Glaize said, similarly, &quot;choked with more or less ruined buildings&quot;. The enclosure is divided into four parts by a cruciform gallery, each part almost filled by these later irregular additions. The walls of this gallery, and the interior of the central sanctuary, are covered with holes for the fixing of bronze plates which would originally have covered them and the outside of the sanctuary—1500 tonnes was used to decorate the whole temple. At the centre of the temple, in place of the original statue of Lokesvara, is a stupa built several centuries after the temple&#x27;s initial construction.

== Microbial degradation ==

Microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at Angkor Wat, Preah Khan, and the Bayon and West Prasat in Angkor. The dehydration and radiation resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone. A dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external Preah Khan samples, while the alga Trentepohlia was found only in samples taken from external, pink-stained stone at Preah Khan.

<text>Ta Som () is a small temple at Angkor, Cambodia, built at the end of the 12th century for King Jayavarman VII. It is located north east of Angkor Thom and just east of Neak Pean. The King dedicated the temple to his father Dharanindravarman II &quot;(Paramanishkalapada)&quot; who was King of the Khmer Empire from 1150 to 1160. The temple consists of a single shrine located on one level and surrounded by enclosure laterite walls. Like the nearby Preah Khan and Ta Prohm the temple was left largely unrestored, with numerous trees and other vegetation growing among the ruins. In 1998, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) added the temple to their restoration program and began work to stabilise the structure to make it safer for visitors.

== Structure ==
Designed to be entered from the east, Ta Som is surrounded by a moat and enclosed by three laterite walls which are broken by two sets of gopura (entrance ways). The gopuras are cross-shaped and contain a small room on each side along with windows containing balusters. The main structure of the gopura are carved with four faces in the Bayon style. The eastern outer gopura has been overgrown by a sacred fig (&quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;) which has grown down through the blocks that make up the gopura and into the ground. The inner section of the temple consists of a central cruciform sanctuary with porches at each arm surrounded by four corner pavilions. Two small libraries sit on either side of the eastern entrance path.

== Restoration ==
According to the APSARA Authority who manage the temples in the Angkor Park, little restoration work had been done at Ta Som until the 1950s. At this time some propping of structures that were near collapse was carried out. After the WMF added Ta Som to their project, the WMF team began to document and interpret the site and carry out emergency stabilization of fragile structures and improvement to visitor flow around the monument. In 2007, WMF and the APSARA Authority conducted clearing and documentation works that allowed the temple to be accessed from all four sides. Many sandstone blocks were repaired and this allowed the reconstruction of the North Central Fronton of the North Gopura.

<text>Michael Doughty (born 5 August 1979) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL) between 2000 and 2012. He is now playing for Reynella Football Club in the Southern Football League, where he played junior football.

Originally from South Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), Doughty was drafted by Adelaide with their first choice (fourth overall) at the 1999 Rookie Draft and elevated to Adelaide&#x27;s senior list in 2000 when he made his senior AFL debut.

Known as a solid utility player, Doughty has most often used as a midfielder, tagger or a small defender. Doughty played his 150th game in round 8, 2009 and his 200th game in Round 15, 2011. Adelaide defeated Sydney by seven points to end a record-equalling six-match losing streak in this match. He retired at the end of the 2012 season, having played in 24 of Adelaide&#x27;s 25 matches, only missing one game when his wife Sara gave birth to his son, Max. He joined sports management company Elite Sports Properties as a player manager after retiring as a player.

<text>Stephen Michael Stirling (born September 30, 1953) is a Canadian-American science fiction and fantasy author who was born in France. Stirling is the author of the Draka series of alternate history novels, the later time travel/alternate history Nantucket series and the Emberverse series.

==Early life and education==
Stirling was born on September 30, 1953, in Metz, France—then the site of a Royal Canadian Air Force base—to an English mother and Canadian father. He has lived in several countries and currently resides in the United States in New Mexico with his wife Jan.

Stirling, along with Eric Flint, was tuckerized as a Secret Service agent in John Birmingham&#x27;s alternate history WWII novel &quot;Weapons of Choice&quot; (2004).

==Career==
Stirling&#x27;s novels are generally conflict-driven and often describe military situations and militaristic cultures. In addition to his books&#x27; military, adventure, and exploration focus, he often describes societies with cultural values significantly different from modern Western views. One of his recurring topics is the influence of the culture on an individual&#x27;s outlook and values, with an emphasis on the idea that most people and societies consider themselves moral.

Stirling frequently explores technological development within the context of many of his novels. The Draka, for instance, choose and face a different imperative in their conquest of Africa, and turn earlier to breech-loading firearms and steam power than the rest of the Western world. The stranded islanders of the Nantucket series try to rebuild their technological base once the island is thrown back in time to 1250 BC, while the survivors of the &quot;Event&quot; now face a world where electricity, firearms, and internal combustion no longer work.

Stirling also tends to write strong female characters who have prominent roles within the story.

In the past, he has frequently collaborated with other authors, including David Drake, Jerry Pournelle, Anne McCaffrey, and Raymond E. Feist.

<doc id="451094" wikidata="Q157748" url="?curid=451094" title="Pyracantha">
<text>Pyracantha (from Greek &quot;fire&quot; and &quot;thorn&quot;, hence firethorn) is a genus of large, thorny evergreen shrubs in the family Rosaceae, with common names firethorn or pyracantha. They are native to an area extending from Southwest Europe east to Southeast Asia. They resemble and are related to &quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, but have serrated leaf margins and numerous thorns (&quot;Cotoneaster&quot; is thornless).

== Description ==

The plants reach up to tall. Leaves are small and oval. The seven species have small white flowers which are 5-merous and many stamened. Fruit are either red, orange, or yellow pomes. The flowers are produced during late spring and early summer; the fruit develops in late summer, and matures in late autumn.

===Fruit===
The fruit of &quot;Pyracantha&quot; are classified as pomes. The pulp is safe for human consumption, but it is insipid, and the seeds are mildly poisonous as they contain cyanogenic glycosides (as do apples, plums, cherries, and almonds). Seeds that are chewed and crushed while raw will release cyanogenic glycosides, and can cause mild gastro-intestinal problems when eaten in large enough quantities. The fruit can be made into jelly. The fruits persist significantly into winter which makes them a valuable bird food.

===Fossil record===
A large number of fossil fruits of †&quot;Pyracantha acuticarpa&quot; have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Pyracantha&quot; is a member of the Rose family, and includes seven species. The genus was defined by 19th century botanist Max Joseph Roemer. The term &quot;Pyracantha&quot; derives from the Greek pyrakantha, referring to pyr &quot;fire&quot;, and akantha &quot;thorn, thorny plant&quot;.

==Species==
*&quot;Pyracantha angustifolia&quot;. Southwest China.
*&quot;Pyracantha atalantioides&quot;. Southern China.
*&quot;Pyracantha coccinea.&quot; Northeastern Spain east to Northern Iran.
*&quot;Pyracantha crenatoserrata&quot;. Central China.
*&quot;Pyracantha crenulata&quot;. Himalaya.
*&quot;Pyracantha koidzumii&quot;. Taiwan.
*&quot;Pyracantha rogersiana&quot;. Yunnan.

==Cultivation==
Pyracanthas are valuable ornamental plants, grown in gardens for their decorative flowers and fruit, often very densely borne. The thorns are easily able to puncture human skin, and when successful, the piercing causes a slight inflammation and severe pain. Their dense thorny structure makes them particularly valued in situations where an impenetrable barrier is required. The aesthetic characteristics of pyracanthas, in conjunction with their home security qualities, make them an alternative to artificial fences and walls. They are also good shrubs for a wildlife garden, providing dense cover for roosting and nesting birds, summer flowers for bees and an abundance of berries as a food source.

===Cultivars===
The following cultivars have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
*&quot;Pyracantha&quot; &#x27;Orange Glow&#x27; (orange berries)
*&quot;Pyracantha&quot; (&#x27;Cadange&#x27;) (orange berries)
*&quot;Pyracantha&quot; (&#x27;Cadrou&#x27;) (orange-red berries)
*&quot;Pyracantha&quot; &#x27;Teton&#x27; (orange-yellow berries)
*&quot;Pyracantha rogersiana&quot; &#x27;Flava&#x27; (yellow berries)

==Ecology==
Pyracantha fruit can be dispersed into natural areas, allowing plants to invade natural communities. Species of Pyracantha are considered to be invasive in portions of the United States, including the states of California and Georgia. Orange firethorn (&quot;Pyracantha angustifolia&quot;) is considered to be a weed or potential (&quot;sleeper&quot;) weed in several states or territories of Australia, including Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales. As a consequence, importation and propagation are prohibited in some parts of Australia.

<doc id="451095" wikidata="Q1757962" url="?curid=451095" title="Japanese addressing system">
<text>The Japanese addressing system is used to identify a specific location in Japan.

When written in Japanese characters, addresses start with the largest geographical entity and proceed to the most specific one. The Japanese system is complex and idiosyncratic, the product of the natural growth of urban areas, as opposed to the systems used in cities that are laid out as grids and divided into quadrants or districts.

When written in Latin characters, addresses follow the convention used by most Western addresses and start with the smallest geographic entity (typically a house number) and proceed to the largest. However, even when translated using Latin characters, Japan Post requires that the address also is written in Japanese to ensure correct delivery.

==Address parts==
Japanese addresses begin with the largest division of the country, the prefecture. Most of these are called &quot;ken&quot; (県), but there are also three other special prefecture designations: &quot;to&quot; (都) for Tokyo, &quot;dō&quot; (道) for &quot;Hokkaidō&quot; and &quot;fu&quot; (府) for the two urban prefectures of Osaka and Kyoto.

Following the prefecture is the municipality. For a large municipality this is the city (&quot;shi&quot;, 市). Cities that have a large enough population (greater than 500,000 residents) and are regarded as such by order of the Cabinet of Japan are called designated cities, and are subdivided into wards (&quot;ku&quot;, 区), where in the prefecture of Tokyo, 23 of them are designated as the with added authority to the mayors. For smaller municipalities, the address includes the district (&quot;gun&quot;, 郡) followed by the town (&quot;chō&quot; or &quot;machi&quot;, 町) or village (&quot;mura&quot; or &quot;son&quot;, 村). In Japan, a city is separate from districts, which contain towns and villages.

For addressing purposes, municipalities may be divided into &quot;chō&quot; or &quot;machi&quot; (two different readings of the character 町, depending on the particular case) and/or &quot;aza&quot; (字). Despite using the same character as town, the &quot;machi&quot; here is purely a unit of address, not administration; likewise, there are also &quot;ku&quot; address divisions that are not administrative special wards. There are two common schemes:

# Municipality is divided first into &quot;machi&quot; and then into city districts (丁目 &quot;chōme&quot;). Example: 台東区[浅草四丁目] (Taito-&quot;ku&quot;, [Asakusa, 4-&quot;chōme&quot;])
# Municipality is divided into &quot;ō-aza&quot; (大字), which may be divided into &quot;aza&quot; (字), which may in turn be divided into &quot;ko-aza&quot; (小字). Example: 青森市[大字滝沢字住吉] (Aomori-&quot;shi&quot;, [&quot;ō-aza&quot; Takizawa, &quot;aza&quot; Sumiyoshi])

However, exceptions abound, and the line between the schemes is often blurry as there are no clear delimiters for &quot;machi&quot;, &quot;aza&quot;, etc. There are also some municipalities like Ryūgasaki, Ibaraki which do not use any subdivisions.

Below this level, two styles of addressing are possible.

# In the newer style, enacted into law by the and used by the majority of the country, the next level is the city block (街区 &quot;gaiku&quot;), always followed by the building number (番号 &quot;bangō&quot;). Building 10 in block 5 would be formally written as 5番10号 (5-&quot;ban&quot; 10-&quot;gō&quot;). For apartment buildings, the apartment number (部屋番号 &quot;heya bangō&quot;) may be appended to the building with a hyphen, so apartment 103 in the aforementioned building would be 5番10-103号.
# In the older style, still used in some rural and older city areas, the next level is the area/block name (地区 &quot;chiku&quot;, often abbreviated as 区 &quot;ku&quot;), the next smaller level is the lot number (番地 &quot;banchi&quot;), optionally followed by a lot number extension (formally , more often ). The lot number designates a plot of land registered in the land registry, and a lot number extension is assigned when a piece of land is divided into two or more pieces in the registry. This can be written as any of 3番地5 (3-&quot;banchi&quot; 5), 3番地の5 (3-&quot;banchi-no&quot; 5) or 3番5 (3-&quot;ban&quot; 5). Land not designated by the registry is known as &quot;mubanchi&quot; , with any dwellings there being &quot;bangaichi&quot; .

In both styles, since all address elements from &quot;chōme&quot; down are numeric, in casual use it is common to form them into a string separated by hyphens or the possessive suffix の (&quot;no&quot;), resulting in Asakusa 4-5-10 or Asakusa 4の5の10. This renders the two styles indistinguishable, but since each municipality adopts one style or the other, there is no risk of ambiguity. The apartment number may also be appended, resulting in 4-5-10-103.

Street names are seldom used in postal addresses (except in Kyoto and some Hokkaidō cities such as Sapporo. See below.)

&quot;Banchi&quot; blocks often have an irregular shape, as &quot;banchi&quot; numbers were assigned by order of registration in the older system, meaning that especially in older areas of the city they will not run in a linear order. For this reason, when giving directions to a location, people will often offer cross streets, visual landmarks and subway stations, such as &quot;at Chūō-dori and Matsuya-dori across the street from Matsuya and Ginza station&quot; for a store in Tokyo. Many businesses feature maps on their literature and business cards. Signs attached to utility poles often specify the city district name and block number, and detailed block maps of the immediate area are sometimes posted near bus stops and train stations in larger cities. 

In addition to the address itself, all locations in Japan have a postal code. After the reform of 1998, this begins with a three-digit number, a hyphen, and a four-digit number, for example 123-4567. A postal mark, 〒, may precede the code to indicate that the number following is a postal code.

==Address order==
In Japanese, the address is written in order from largest unit to smallest, with the addressee&#x27;s name last of all. For example, the address of the is

:〒100-8994 東京都千代田区丸ノ内二丁目7番2号 東京中央郵便局

:&quot;〒100-8994 Tōkyō-to Chiyoda-ku Marunouchi 2-Chōme 7-ban 2-gō Tōkyō Chūō Yūbin-kyoku&quot;

or

:〒100-8994 東京都千代田区丸ノ内2-7-2 東京中央郵便局

:&quot;〒100-8994 Tōkyō-to Chiyoda-ku Marunouchi 2-7-2 Tōkyō Chūō Yūbin-kyoku&quot;

The order is reversed when writing in rōmaji. The format recommended by Japan Post is:

:Tokyo Central Post Office7-2, Marunouchi 2-ChomeChiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-8994

In this address, Tokyo is the prefecture; Chiyoda-ku is one of the special wards; Marunouchi 2-Chome is the name of the city district; and 7-2 is the city block and building number. In practice it is common for the &quot;chōme&quot; to be prefixed, as in Japanese, resulting in the somewhat shorter:

:Tokyo Central Post Office2-7-2 Marunouchi, Chiyoda-kuTokyo 100-8994

While almost all elements of the address are reversed when written in rōmaji, connected strings of numbers are treated as units and not reversed. Firstly, the &quot;city block and building number&quot; is a unit, and its digits are not reversed – in this example it is &quot;7-2&quot; in both Japanese and roman, though the Japanese (literally &quot;Marunouchi 2-Chōme 7-2&quot;) is partly reversed to &quot;7-2, Marunouchi 2-Chōme&quot; in roman if &quot;chōme&quot; is separate. Similarly, if the &quot;chōme&quot; is included, these also form a unit, so in this example the string is 2-7-2 in both Japanese and Western alphabet.

==Special cases==
As mentioned above, there are certain areas of Japan that use somewhat unusual address systems. Sometimes the differing system has been incorporated into the official system, as in Sapporo, while in Kyoto the system is completely different from, but used alongside the official system. Kyoto and Sapporo have addresses based on their streets being laid out in a grid plan, unlike most Japanese cities.

===Kyoto===

Although the official national addressing system is in use in Kyoto – in &quot;Chiban&quot; style, with , , and , the &quot;chō&quot; divisions are very small, numerous, and there is often more than one &quot;chō&quot; with the same name within a single ward, making the system extremely confusing. As a result, most residents of Kyoto use an unofficial system based instead on street names, a form of vernacular geography. This system is, however, recognized by the post office and by government agencies.

For added precision, the street-based address can be given, followed by the chō and land number. Sometimes multiple houses share a given land number, in which case the name (either just family name, or full name of resident) must also be specified; this name is generally displayed in front of the house on a , often decoratively presented, as are house numbers in other countries.

The system works by naming the intersection of two streets and then indicating if the address is , , , or of the intersection. More precisely, the two streets of the intersection are not treated symmetrically: one names the street that the address is on, then gives a nearby cross street, and then specifies the address relative to the cross street. What this means is that a building can have more than one address depending on which cross street intersection is chosen.

For instance, the address of Kyoto Tower is listed on their website as:
:〒600-8216
:京都市下京区烏丸通七条下ル 東塩小路町 721-1
Following the postcode, this contains the city and ward, followed by the unofficial address, a space, and then the official address:
:京都市下京区 &quot;Kyōto-shi, Shimogyō-ku&quot;
:烏丸七条下ル &quot;Karasuma-Shichijō-sagaru&quot;
:東塩小路町 721-1 &quot;Higashi-Shiokōji 721-1&quot;

This address means &quot;south of the intersection of Karasuma and Shichijō streets&quot; – more precisely, &quot;on Karasuma, below (south of) Shichijō&quot; (Karasuma runs north–south, while Shichijō is an east–west cross street). The street address may alternatively be given as 烏丸通七条下ル (with inserted), indicating clearly that the address is &quot;on&quot; Karasuma street.

However, the system is flexible and allows for various alternatives, such as:
:京都府京都市下京区烏丸塩小路上ル
:&quot;Kyōto-fu, Kyōto-shi, Shimogyō-ku, Karasuma-Shiokōji-agaru&quot;
:&quot;(On) Karasuma (street), above (north of) Shiokōji (street)&quot;

For less well known buildings, the official address is often given after the informal one, as in the address for the Shinatora Ramen restaurant:
:京都府京都市下京区烏丸通五条下ル大坂町384
:&quot;Kyōto-fu, Kyōto-shi, Shimogyō-ku, Karasuma-dōri-Gojō-sagaru, Ōsakachō 384&quot;
:&quot;Ōsakachō 384, (on) Karasuma street, below (south of) Gojō&quot;

As the initial part of the address is familiar, it is often abbreviated – for example, can be abbreviated to , as in the Kyoto Tower listing. More informally, particularly on return addresses for in-town mail, the city and ward can be abbreviated to the initial character, with a dot or comma to indicate abbreviation – there are only 11 wards of Kyoto, so this is easily understood. For example, 京都市 &quot;Kyōto-shi&quot; is abbreviated to 京、 &quot;Kyō–&quot; and 下京区 &quot;Shimogyō-ku&quot; is abbreviated to 下、&quot;Shimo–&quot;. Combining these (and dropping okurigana), one may abbreviate the address of Kyoto Tower to:
:〒600-8216
:京、下、烏丸七条下
:&quot;Karasuma-Shichijō-sagaru, Shimo–, Kyō–, 600-8216&quot;

===Sapporo===
Sapporo&#x27;s system, though official, differs in structure from regular Japanese addresses. The city-center is divided into quadrants by two intersecting roads, Kita-Ichijo and Soseigawa; blocks are then named based on their distance from this point, and farther from the city center, multiple blocks are included in each. The east–west distance is indicated by &quot;chōme&quot; (a slightly unorthodox usage of &quot;chōme&quot;), while the north–south distance is indicated by &quot;jō&quot;, which has been incorporated into the &quot;chō&quot; name.

The address to Sapporo JR Tower is:

:札幌市中央区北5条西2丁目5番地
:&quot;Sapporo-shi, Chūō-ku, kita-5-jō-nishi 2-chōme 5-banchi&quot;

This address indicates that it is the fifth building on a block located on 5 &quot;jō&quot; north and 2 &quot;chōme&quot; west of the center, named with the actual cardinal names of &quot;kita&quot; (north), &quot;minami&quot; (south), &quot;nishi&quot; (west), and &quot;higashi&quot; (east). The directional names for &quot;jō&quot; extend for about 7 kilometers to the north–south along the main Soseigawa Dori, but only about 3 kilometers at the most to the east and west; outside of that area, &quot;jō&quot; have other names, though the starting point of each is still the corner in the direction of the city center, often using landmarks such as the Hakodate Main Line or large roads to mark the new numbering.

For example, far in the outskirts is the Sapporo Tachibana Hospital, at:

:〒006-0841　札幌市手稲区曙11条2丁目3番12号
:&quot;Sapporo-shi, Teine-ku, Akebono-11-jō, 2-chōme-3-ban-12-gō&quot;

Building 12 on block 3 of a &quot;chōme&quot; measuring 11 &quot;jō&quot; north and 2 &quot;chōme&quot; west of where the Hakodate Main Line meets Tarukawa Street. Or Toyohira Ward office, at:

:〒062-0934 札幌市豊平区平岸6条10丁目1-1
:&quot;Sapporo, Toyohira-ku, Hiragishi-6-jō, 10-chōme-1-ban-1-gō&quot;

Building 1 on block 1 of a &quot;chōme&quot; measuring 6 &quot;jō&quot; south and 10 &quot;chōme&quot; east of where a small street meets the Toyohira River. The direction is understood based on the quadrant of the city the &quot;jō&quot; is considered to be in, which may be off from the actual direction to the city center, depending on the landmark used.

Far-flung and less crowded parts of the city may instead use a standard &quot;chō&quot; name, rather than a numbered &quot;jō&quot;, such as Makomanai.

===Ōita===
Many areas of Ōita Prefecture including the cities of Ōita and Usuki commonly use an unofficial parallel system known as or . While outwardly similar, these addresses end in &quot;kumi&quot; (組) or &quot;ku&quot; (区):

:大分県大分市羽屋4-1-A組
:&quot;Haneya 4-1-A-kumi, Ōita-shi, Ōita-ken&quot;

:大分県臼杵市臼杵洲崎四丁目1組
:&quot;Suzaki 4-chōme 1-kumi, Usuki-shi, Ōita-ken&quot;

As the names indicate, these derive from traditional neighbourhood councils. While they continue to be used locally (e.g. school and electoral districts) and may be accepted for mail delivery, they are not considered official addresses, and individual buildings in each &quot;kumi&quot; will also have a standard &quot;ōaza-banchi&quot; address. For example, Usuki City Hall, while within Suzaki 4-chome 1-kumi, has the formal address of Usuki 72–1, which may be prepended with &quot;&quot; for clarity:

:〒875-8501
:大分県臼杵市大字臼杵72-1
:&quot;Ōaza Usuki 72-1, Usuki-shi, Ōita-ken 875-8501&quot;

===Katakana blocks (&quot;bu&quot;)===
Some cities in Ishikawa Prefecture, including Kanazawa and Nanao, sometimes use katakana in the &quot;iroha&quot; ordering (イ・ロ・ハ・ニ ... ) instead of numbers for blocks. These are called &quot;bu&quot; (部). For example, the address of the Kagaya Hotel in Nanao is:

:〒926-0192石川県七尾市和倉町ヨ80
:&quot;Wakuramachi yo 80, Nanao-shi, Ishikawa-ken 926-0192 &quot;

===&quot;Jikkan&quot; instead of numbered &quot;chōme&quot;===
Some cities, including parts of Nagaoka, Niigata, use &quot;jikkan&quot; (甲・乙・丙 ... ) prefixed to the block number to indicate traditional divisions. These function similarly to &quot;chōme&quot; and are treated as such in addresses. For example, Yoita police station in Nagaoka has the address:

:〒940-2402
:&quot;Yoita-otsu 5881-3, Yoita-machi, Nagaoka-shi, Niigata-ken 940-2402&quot;

== History ==
The current addressing system was established after World War II as a slight modification of the scheme used since the Meiji era.

For historical reasons, names quite frequently conflict. It is typical in Hokkaidō where many place names are identical to those found in the rest of Japan, for example Shin-Hiroshima (literally new Hiroshima) to Hiroshima, largely as the result of the systematic group emigration projects since the late 19th century to Hokkaidō; people from villages across mainland Japan dreamt to become wealthy farmers. Historians note that there is also a significant similarity between place names in Kansai region and those in northern Kyūshū. See Japanese place names for more.

==Named roads==
Named roads are roads or sections deemed noteworthy and given a name. Unlike in other nations, named roads are not used in addresses but merely for logistic purposes; excepting in the above-mentioned Kyoto system.

<text>Charles Burns (born September 27, 1955) is an American cartoonist and illustrator.
His early work was published in a Sub Pop fanzine, and he achieved prominence in the early issues of &quot;RAW&quot;. His graphic novel &quot;Black Hole&quot; won the Harvey Award.

==Career==

===Comics===
Charles Burns&#x27;s earliest works include illustrations for the Sub Pop fanzine, and &quot;Another Room Magazine&quot; of Oakland, but he came to prominence when his comics were published for the first time in early issues of &quot;RAW&quot;, the avant-garde comics magazine founded in 1980 by Françoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman. In 1982, Burns did a die-cut cover for RAW #4. Raw Books also published two books of Burns as RAW One-Shots: &quot;Big Baby&quot; and &quot;Hard-Boiled Defective Stories&quot;. In 1994, he was awarded a Pew Fellowship. In 1999, he showed at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

Most of Burns&#x27;s short stories, published in various outlets over the decades, were later collected in the three volumes of the &quot;Charles Burns Library&quot; (hardcovers from Fantagraphics Books): &quot;El Borbah&quot; (1999), &quot;Big Baby&quot; (2000), and &quot;Skin Deep&quot; (2001). (A fourth and last volume, &quot;Bad Vibes&quot;, has yet to be published, which would have the Library collecting the entirety of his pre-&quot;Black Hole&quot; comics work. It was later stated that Burns did not feel there was enough material for a complete fourth volume.)

From 1993 to 2004, he serialized the 12 chapters of his Harvey Award-winning graphic novel &quot;Black Hole&quot; (12 issues from Kitchen Sink Press and Fantagraphics Books). The series was collected into a single volume in 2005. &quot;Black Hole&quot; was featured prominently in the film &quot;Dawn of the Planet of the Apes&quot;.

In 2007 Burns contributed material for the French made animated horror anthology &quot;Fear(s) of the Dark&quot;.

In October 2010, Burns released the first part of a new series, &quot;X&#x27;ed Out&quot;. Part two of the new trilogy, &quot;The Hive&quot;, was released in October 2012. &quot;Sugar Skull&quot;, the final installment in the trilogy, was released Fall of 2014. The series was collected into a single volume, &quot;Last Look&quot;, published by Pantheon in 2016.

===Illustration===
Burns&#x27;s high-profile illustrations include album cover work for the Iggy Pop album &quot;Brick by Brick&quot;. His art was also licensed by The Coca-Cola Company to illustrate product and advertising material for their failed OK Soda product. More recently, he has worked on advertising campaigns for Altoids and portrait illustrations for &quot;The Believer&quot;. In the early 1990s, his &quot;Dogboy&quot; stories were adapted by MTV as a live-action serial for &quot;Liquid Television&quot;. In 1991, choreographer Mark Morris commissioned him to create illustrations that were then used as a basis for his version of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker,&quot; &quot;The Hard Nut&quot;. Burns&#x27;s style was a source of inspiration for Martin Ander&#x27;s artwork for &quot;Fever Ray&quot;, Karin Dreijer Andersson&#x27;s solo project.

<text>Alexander Schleicher [[GmbH]] &amp; Co is a major manufacturer of sailplanes located in Poppenhausen, near Fulda in Germany.

It is also the oldest sailplane manufacturer in the world.

==History==
The company was founded in 1927 by Alexander Schleicher using money that he had won as a pilot in a gliding competition. It grew quickly in size and fame, producing many notable designs including the &quot;Anfänger (&quot;Beginner&quot;)&quot;, &quot;Zögling (&quot;Student&quot;)&quot;, &quot;Professor&quot;, &quot;Mannheim&quot;, and the &quot;Stadt Frankfurt (City of Frankfurt)&quot;.

Meanwhile, the aircraft produced under contract by the company continued to grow in size and complexity, reaching their pinnacle with the &quot;DFS Rhönadler (Rhön eagle)&quot; and &quot;DFS Rhönbussard (Rhön buzzard)&quot; designed by Hans Jacobs, and a huge, three-seat experimental glider built from a design by Alexander Lippisch for the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS - German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight).

=== Production during WW2 ===

By the time war broke out in Europe in 1939, Schleicher was already employing hundreds of workers in what was a major enterprise.

During World War II, the factory was used to maintain and repair training gliders for the Hitler Youth, who received flight training at the Wasserkuppe.

At the end of the war in 1945, aviation activities were suspended in allied-occupied Germany, and Alexander Schleicher returned to his roots, using his factory to build furniture until the restrictions were lifted in 1951, and the company could build sailplanes once more.

=== In the 21st century ===
The company is managed by Alexander&#x27;s grandsons, Peter Kremer, and Ulrich Kremer.

==Gliders==
The first notable post-war designs were made by Rudolf Kaiser and include:
* Ka 1 (Single-seat trainer)
* Ka 2 (Two-seat trainer)
* Ka 3 (Single-seat trainer)
* Ka 4 (Two-seat trainer)
* Ka 6 (Standard Class)
* K 7 (Two-seat trainer)
* K 8 (Standard Class)
* K 10 (Standard Class)
* ASK 13 (Two-seat trainer)
* ASK 14 (Single-seat touring motor glider)
* ASK 16 (Two-seat touring motor glider)
* ASK 18 (Club Class)
* ASK 21 (Glass fibre two-seat trainer)
* ASK 23 (Glass fibre Club Class)

The modern era of using composite materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber began with single-seat gliders designed by Gerhard Waibel. His designs are:
* ASW 12 (Open Class)
* ASW 15 (Standard Class)
* ASW 17 (Open Class)
* ASW 19 (Standard Class)
* ASW 20 (15 metre Class, some with tip extensions)
* ASW 22 (Open Class)
* ASW 24 (Standard Class)
* ASW 27 (15 metre Class)
* ASW 28 (Standard Class, but some also with tips for 18 metres)

Designers Martin Heide and Michael Greiner have produced:
* ASH 25 (Two-seat Open Class)
* ASH 26 (18 metre Class, often motorised)
* ASG 29 (15 metre Class and 18 metre Class)
* ASH 30 Mi (Two-seat Open Class, motorised, replacing ASH 25)
* ASH 31 (Open class and 18 metre class, replacing ASH 26)
* ASG 32 (Two-Seater Class)

Following the retirement of Martin Heide, successive aircraft were designed by a team that includes Joschka Schmeisl, Paul Anklam, Andreas Storch, Ulrich Simon, Tobias Mörsel and Manfred Munch:

* AS 33 (15/18 metre Class, ASG 29 successor)
* AS 34 Me (15/18 metre Class, self launching electric)
* AS 35 Mi (18/Open Class, self launching, replacing ASH31)

<text>The Xaverian Brothers or Congregation of St. Francis Xavier are a Roman Catholic religious institute founded by Theodore James Ryken in Bruges, Belgium, in 1839 and named after Saint Francis Xavier. The institute is dedicated to education.

==History==

Theodore James Ryken was born in 1797 in the small village of Elshout, North Brabant, the Netherlands, to ardently Catholic middle class parents. Orphaned at a young age, Ryken was raised by his uncle. Ryken was trained as a shoemaker. He felt a calling by God which drew him to work first as a catechist, followed by helping manage an orphanage, and later by caring for cholera patients in the Netherlands.

At age 34, Ryken went to North America, where he served as a catechist among the missionaries to the Native Americans. During his three-year tour, he conceived the idea of starting a congregation of brothers to work alongside the missionary priests. On returning to Europe, he set about planning to found such a society in Belgium, a country known for its missionary zeal.

===Founding===
When Ryken returned to the United States in 1837, Bishop Joseph Rosati of the Diocese of St. Louis, Missouri, persuaded him that the children of Catholic immigrants were in even more need of instruction than Native Americans. The bishop encouraged him to found a congregation of laymen to teach all classes of youth. Six other bishops sanctioned his plan to bring religious teachers to the United States.

Ryken went to Rome to receive the permission and blessing of Pope Gregory XVI for his mission. He then, at Bishop Boussen&#x27;s request, served a year&#x27;s novitiate with the Redemptorist Fathers.
He modeled the religious garb of members of his institute after that of the Redemptorists. The spirit of the Xaverian Brothers, on the other hand, can be traced to the influence of Isidore Van de Kerckhove, the Jesuit confessor and counselor of Ryken; De Kerckhhove drew up the original rules of the order. Although many religious institutes were being founded at the time as part of a Catholic revival that succeeded the fall of Napoleon I, Ryken had a different vision. He wanted to found a missionary institute rather than a congregation that would address the needs of a specific region.

On June 15, 1839, Ryken, then 42 years old, settled in a rented house on Ezelstraat in the centuries-old city of Bruges, Belgium. For five days he waited for the arrival of the two companions who had promised to join him in his undertaking: a weaver and a tailor. His companions proved to be less dedicated and resilient than he and he needed a year to recruit better suited candidates. He and his colleagues soon opened two primary schools in Bruges, and some of the Xavieran Brothers were sent to a normal school at Sint-Truiden for professional teacher training.

By 1841, the community had grown beyond the space available in the little house on Ezelstraat; with a loan from a sympathetic banker, Ryken purchased a large estate in a neighboring section of Bruges called &quot;Het Walletje&quot;, for the moat that surrounded it. A boys&#x27; sodality was opened at Het Walletje, followed shortly by a primary school in the same place; the work of catechizing was taken up at the Church of Notre-Dame, and some attention was given to the training of deaf-mutes. The brothers&#x27; first grammar school was opened at Bruges in 1844 and in the following year a second school was established. The Xaverian Brothers began to attract candidates from Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, England, Ireland and France.

In 1848, a colony of brothers went to England to open schools in parishes in Bury and Manchester. Eventually, they opened Clapham College, London and the boarding schools of Mayfield College and its associated preparatory boarding school at Foxhunt Manor, in Sussex. Mayfield College closed in 1999 because of the lack of entrants to the order.

===Troubles and resignation===
For the rest of his superiorship, Ryken would be burdened by the loan he took in order to purchase Het Walletje. In addition, he was not a very good administrator, and his institute had a crisis at the Mother House in Bruges. Ryken was asked to tender his resignation by Jean-Baptiste Malou, Bishop of Bruges. Ryken willingly turned over his office to a younger man, and spent the last eleven years of his life as a simple member of the institute he had established.

Before his death on November 26, 1871, at age 74, Ryken attended the first general chapter of his institute in Bruges in 1869. By this time the institute had cleared its debt and the number of brothers had increased from 58 in 1860 to 133. They had nine well-established communities working among the poor in Belgium, England, and the United States.

===Mission to the United States===
In 1853 Louisville Bishop Martin Spalding invited the Xaverian brothers to open a school in his diocese, and in 1854 the first colony of brothers moved to the United States. The Brothers took charge of several parochial schools in 1864 and opened St. Xavier High School, Louisville, Kentucky.

In 1864, Spalding, then Archbishop of Baltimore, asked the Xaverians to open schools there, and they did so. Baltimore was made the center of Xaverian activities in the United States, and in 1876 a novitiate was opened there at the site of Mount Saint Joseph College, where it still stands.

By 1900, the Xaverian Brothers had opened schools in New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania.

====Rosary making====
A small Rosary-making club formed by Xaverian Brother Sylvan Mattingly in Louisville, Kentucky in 1949 grew to be the largest Catholic Rosary making group in the United States. Inspired by the message of Our Lady of Fatima, Mattingly formed &quot;Our Lady of Fatima Rosary Making Club&quot; in the basement of St. Xavier High School. Although Mattingly died in 1951, the organization grew to be Our Lady&#x27;s Rosary Makers, which has 17,000 active members in the United States and has distributed hundreds of millions of free rosaries worldwide.

Controversy

Following a Pennsylvania Grand Jury ruling in 2019, an internal Xaverian Brothers investigation revealed 34 brothers credibly accused of sexually abusing school children.

<doc id="451108" wikidata="Q735357" url="?curid=451108" title="Tubular Bells II">
<text>Tubular Bells II is the fifteenth studio album by English guitarist and songwriter Mike Oldfield. It was released on 31 August 1992 by Warner Music UK and is the successor to his debut album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973). It was Oldfield&#x27;s first album for Warner after having worked with Virgin Records for twenty years. Like its predecessor, &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; charted at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart and spun off a top 10 single, &quot;Sentinel&quot;.

==Background==
In January 1991, Oldfield&#x27;s contract with Virgin Records expired, thus ending a partnership that had lasted since 1972 as the first musician signed to the label. Virgin had pressed Oldfield to produce a sequel to his debut album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973) for a number of years but Oldfield resisted, partly due to his increasing dissatisfaction in Virgin&#x27;s efforts to promote his albums and his rift with co-founder Richard Branson. Oldfield also felt that making a sequel in the 1970s, so soon after its release, would have been &quot;far too obvious&quot; and may lead to creative burnout. &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; became Oldfield&#x27;s best selling album and had continued to sell around 100,000 copies each year. After releasing &quot;Heavens Open&quot; (1991), his final album for Virgin, Oldfield felt the time was right to start on a sequel to &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. At the same time he signed a two-album recording deal with Warner Music UK following negotiations with chairman Rob Dickins. Oldfield praised management at Warner for expressing interest in his music and offering constructive suggestions that would help sales without feeling &quot;tied by them&quot;, as opposed to Virgin.

==Writing and recording==
Before Oldfield started to write music for the album, he revisited &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; and mapped out its composition into different coloured sections. He kept a progress chart in his home studio, writing directly onto the wallpaper in pen; his first entry was in June 1991 when he recorded the first piano figure for the album.

To produce the album, Oldfield chose Trevor Horn with assistance from Tom Newman, who had also helped to produce &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. In 2018, Newman stated that when Horn was brought into the project, he insisted that the instruments be sequenced rather than played by hand, which led to a major falling-out between Newman and Horn. Horn was based in Los Angeles at this time, so Oldfield rented a mansion off Doheny Drive for nine months to record the album and had his home studio equipment and mixing desk shipped to Los Angeles via the Panama Canal. Oldfield gave Horn the nickname Dr. Click, because of his insistence in having each part played in time. Oldfield credited Horn in giving the album &quot;rhythm and groove&quot; which he considered a weak spot in his technique and something that the original &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; had lacked. Oldfield also credited Horn in encouraging him to play with &quot;more feeling [and] love&quot;, as he had become accustomed to playing in an angry way. &quot;When I did, the music started to sing instead of growling at you.&quot;

When it came to recording the tubular bells for the album, Oldfield underwent a search to find a set he deemed satisfactory enough as he had destroyed the original bells used on &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. He was close to giving up until he visited a percussion shop in London&#x27;s East End, where he &quot;Found a little set, almost like a toy set. And I hit them once and said, &#x27;yeah, that&#x27;s it&#x27;&quot;.

===Master of Ceremonies===
The original &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; featured a section where Vivian Stanshall was the Master of Ceremonies who calls out instruments being played. For &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot;, Oldfield and the production team were unsure whether to include a similar part for the sequel and various takes were made, including one of Oldfield doing the part, another featuring Horn in a Scouse accent, a &quot;Disneyland-type voice&quot;, and the computer HAL 9000 from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). In the end, Oldfield enlisted English actor Alan Rickman to introduce the instruments at the end of &quot;The Bell&quot;, which concludes the first half. He was chosen for the &quot;Shakespearean&quot; style of his voice. Rickman&#x27;s role is credited as &quot;a strolling player&quot;, because he had not been chosen to take part when the artwork had been completed. On alternative mixes of &quot;The Bell&quot; released as single B-sides, Billy Connolly and Stanshall each played the Master of Ceremonies. On two alternative language B-sides, German comedian MC Otto and Spanish musician MC Carlos Finaly played the Master of Ceremonies in German and Spanish, respectively.

==Songs==
&quot;Early Stages&quot;, which is an early version of what would become &quot;Sentinel&quot;, was included as a B-side to the single version of &quot;Sentinel&quot;. &quot;Early Stages&quot; has a somewhat darker mood and is from the pre-Trevor Horn development of the album, possibly showing the kind of influence that Horn had.

Unlike the original album there is a recurring theme in &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot;, first appearing at the end of &quot;Sentinel&quot; that reappears throughout the album, though it is most obvious at the end of &quot;The Bell&quot;.

Some of the track titles for the album were taken from Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s short stories, including &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Sunjammer&quot;. Other track titles could just be references to science-fiction or space in general, such as &quot;Dark Star&quot; and &quot;Weightless&quot;. &quot;Dark Star&quot; is also the title of a sci-fi film by John Carpenter which was released in the same year as the original &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, 1973.

Oldfield has occasionally called some of the tracks on the album by different names in interviews, such as once when he performed &quot;Red Dawn&quot; on BBC Radio 2 he called it &quot;Russian&quot;. The title &quot;Russian&quot; was also later given to the equivalent piece on the re-recorded version of the original &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, &quot;Tubular Bells 2003&quot;.

==Artwork==
&quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; again uses the bent metallic tube (representing a bent tubular bell) as the focus of the album artwork. The bell is a golden colour on a dark blue background as opposed to &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;&#x27; grey/silver bell on top of a sea/skyscape. Both the photos for &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; and &quot;Tubular Bells II&quot; were produced by Trevor Key.

==Release and reception==

The album reached number 1 in the chart in the UK and Spain.

Critical reception to the album was mixed. Writing in &quot;Q&quot; magazine, Mat Snow described it as a &quot;more consistent but less tune-happy musical sequence than TBI&quot; and praised &quot;producer Trevor Horn&#x27;s fairy dust&quot; as an advantage.

==Live performance==
The album was supported with a live concert on the esplanade at Edinburgh Castle on 4 September 1992 with 6,000 people in attendance, which aired on national television one hour after its conclusion. It featured Scottish actor John Gordon Sinclair as the Master of Ceremonies. In October 1992, the show was released on home video as &quot;Tubular Bells II: The Performance Live at Edinburgh Castle&quot;. Oldfield toured the album with his Tubular Bells II 20th Anniversary Tour 1992/93, which visited the US and Europe between March and October 1993.

<text>Delicatessen is a 1991 French post-apocalyptic science fiction black comedy film directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, starring Dominique Pinon, Marie-Laure Dougnac, and Jean-Claude Dreyfus. It was released in North America as &quot;presented by Terry Gilliam.&quot;

==Plot==
In a dilapidated apartment building in post-apocalyptic France, food is in short supply and grain is used as currency. On the ground floor is a butcher&#x27;s shop, run by the landlord, Clapet, who posts job opportunities in the newspaper to lure victims to the building, whom he murders and butchers as a cheap source of meat to sell to his tenants.

Following the murder of the last worker, unemployed circus clown Louison applies for the vacant position. Louison proves to be a superb worker with a spectacular trick knife, and the butcher is reluctant to kill him too quickly. During Louison&#x27;s routine maintenance, he acquires a package dropped by a mailman. Louison delivers the package to Clapet&#x27;s daughter, Julie, who says the package contains confections and invites him to join her that evening. Louison and Julie&#x27;s relationship blossoms into romance. At the same time, several of the tenants fall under Louison&#x27;s boyish charms, worrying others who are more anxious for their own safety should they require meat.

Clapet tells apartment tenant Marcel Tapioca that his rent is late and he must give up his mother-in-law as payment. That evening, Julie begs her father to let Louison go, knowing that Clapet is killing tenants for meat. She goes to her apartment, unwraps a newspaper in her refrigerator and sees an article about the Troglodistes, a group of vegetarian rebels who live underground. Julie descends into the sewers to make contact with the feared Troglodistes, whom she persuades to help rescue Louison.

Following the apparent butchering of Tapioca&#x27;s mother-in-law, the Troglodistes go through the sewer pipes and attempt to capture Louison, but end up mistakenly capturing tenant Mademoiselle Plusse instead. Meanwhile, as Julie and Louison watch television, Clapet ascends to the roof, shaking the television antenna to lure Louison into going up to fix it. Attacking Louison with a cleaver, Clapet&#x27;s attempt to kill him is foiled by an unexpected electrical explosion in one of the apartments.

Clapet, along with some tenants, storms Louison&#x27;s room in another attempt to murder him. Louison and Julie take refuge in a bathroom and flood it, floor to ceiling, until Clapet opens the door, releasing the flood and washing the attackers away. Mademoiselle Plusse escapes the sewers, finds Louison&#x27;s boomerang knife, and gives it to Clapet. Clapet throws the knife towards Louison, but inadvertently kills himself.

Louison and Julie play music together on the roof of the now peaceful apartment building, and the butcher&#x27;s shop closed for good.

==Reception==
The film was received well critically. &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a zany little film that&#x27;s a startling and clever debut.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; called it a &quot;fair bet for cultdom, a lot more likeable than its subject matter suggests, and simply essential viewing for vegetarians&quot;. &quot;Inverse&quot; described the movie as having &quot;striking visual aesthetic inspired by the monochrome photography of French-Hungarian photographer Brassaï, and the fantasy films of Terry Gilliam&quot;.

Not all reviews were positive, however, with Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; saying &quot;its last half-hour is devoted chiefly to letting the characters wreck the sets, and quite literally becomes a washout when the bathtub overflows.&quot; Caryn James, also of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was more positive; she wrote, &quot;at times the film becomes too whimsical for its own good...Despite these minor flaws, as the film meanders from one set piece to another it makes good use of its directors&#x27; experience with short video forms&quot;.

Although &quot;Delicatessen&quot; examines the resistance movement in German-occupied Europe, few film critics commented on this theme upon its initial release.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave it an approval rating of 90% from a total of 58 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet deftly combines horror, sci-fi, and humor in &quot;Delicatessen&quot;, a morbid comedy set in a visually ravishing futuristic dystopia.&quot; Metacritic gave it 66 out of 100 out of a total of 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film won several prestigious European film awards. At the César Awards, it won for Best Editing, Best Debut, Best Production Design, and Best Writing. It won for Best Set Design at the European Film Awards; the Audience Jury Award at Fantasporto; Best Foreign Film at the Guild of German Art House Cinemas; and Best Director, Best Actor, Best Original Soundtrack, and the Prize of Catalan Screenwriter&#x27;s Critic and Writer&#x27;s Association at the Sitges Film Festival. At the Tokyo International Film Festival, it won the Gold Award. The film was nominated for the Grand Prix of the Belgian Syndicate of Cinema Critics. At the BAFTA Awards, it was nominated for Best Film Not in the English Language.

<text>Ferdinand Gottlob Schichau (30 January 1814 – 23 January 1896) was a German mechanical engineer and businessman.

Schichau was born in Elbing, West Prussia (modern Elbląg, Poland) to a smith and iron worker. He studied engineering in Berlin and visited the Rhineland and England. In 1837 he started his own company in Elbing. He also built a shipyard in Pillau near Königsberg (East Prussia) (today Baltiysk, Kaliningrad Oblast).

The &quot;Schichau-Werke&quot; became a large industrial complex, which employed several thousand people. Schichau made hydraulic presses, industrial machines and steam engines. For his workers he erected a large living quarter section in Elbing. The &quot;Borussia&quot;, constructed by him, was the first screw-vessel in Germany.

Schichau gained an associate when his daughter married around 1873 Carl H. Ziese (1848 -1917) the constructor in 1874 of the first compound steam engine to be integrated in a German gunship.

The company had so many orders that it became necessary to construct another large shipyard in nearby Danzig (Gdańsk) as well. In 1896 Schichau employed about 4,000 labourers his private assets were appraised at 30 million German gold mark. Schichau died in Elbing on 23 January 1896, his son in law (Ziese) continued to lead the company till his own death in 1917. Ziese&#x27;s only daughter, Hildegard, married Swedish Engineer Carl Carlson.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Hildegard Carlson ran the former firm of her father Carl and grand father Ferdinand building, mainly, railway engines till the thereafters of a company active till no less than 1945.

When Elbing and Danzig were transferred to Poland after World War II, Schichau&#x27;s memory all but disappeared. The street in Elbing named after him (&quot;Schichaustraße&quot;) was renamed &quot;ul. Stoczniowa&quot;, and his statue was destroyed. His contributions only recently became known in Poland at the end of the Cold War.

Schichau&#x27;s name remains in the Schichau Seebeck Shipyard at Bremerhaven.

<doc id="451120" wikidata="Q1331830" url="?curid=451120" title="Competitive exclusion principle">
<text>In ecology, the competitive exclusion principle, sometimes referred to as Gause&#x27;s law, is a proposition that two species which compete for the same limited resource cannot coexist at constant population values. When one species has even the slightest advantage over another, the one with the advantage will dominate in the long term. This leads either to the extinction of the weaker competitor or to an evolutionary or behavioral shift toward a different ecological niche. The principle has been paraphrased in the maxim &quot;complete competitors cannot coexist&quot;.

==History==
The competitive exclusion principle is classically attributed to Georgy Gause, although he actually never formulated it. The principle is already present in Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection.

Throughout its history, the status of the principle has oscillated between &quot;a priori&quot; (&#x27;two species coexisting &quot;must&quot; have different niches&#x27;) and experimental truth (&#x27;we find that species coexisting do have different niches&#x27;).

==Experimental basis==

Based on field observations, Joseph Grinnell formulated the principle of competitive exclusion in 1904: &quot;Two species of approximately the same food habits are not likely to remain long evenly balanced in numbers in the same region. One will crowd out the other&quot;. Georgy Gause formulated the law of competitive exclusion based on laboratory competition experiments using two species of &quot;Paramecium&quot;, &quot;P. aurelia&quot; and &quot;P. caudatum&quot;. The conditions were to add fresh water every day and input a constant flow of food. Although &quot;P. caudatum&quot; initially dominated, &quot;P. aurelia&quot; recovered and subsequently drove &quot;P. caudatum&quot; extinct via exploitative resource competition. However, Gause was able to let the &quot;P. caudatum&quot; survive by differing the environmental parameters (food, water). Thus, Gause&#x27;s law is valid only if the ecological factors are constant.

==Prediction==
Competitive exclusion is predicted by mathematical and theoretical models such as the Lotka–Volterra models of competition. However, for poorly understood reasons, competitive exclusion is rarely observed in natural ecosystems, and many biological communities appear to violate Gause&#x27;s law. The best-known example is the so-called &quot;paradox of the plankton&quot;. All plankton species live on a very limited number of resources, primarily solar energy and minerals dissolved in the water. According to the competitive exclusion principle, only a small number of plankton species should be able to coexist on these resources. Nevertheless, large numbers of plankton species coexist within small regions of open sea.

Some communities that appear to uphold the competitive exclusion principle are MacArthur&#x27;s warblers and Darwin&#x27;s finches, though the latter still overlap ecologically very strongly, being only affected negatively by competition under extreme conditions.

==Paradoxical traits==

A partial solution to the paradox lies in raising the dimensionality of the system. Spatial heterogeneity, trophic interactions, multiple resource competition, competition-colonization trade-offs, and lag may prevent exclusion (ignoring stochastic extinction over longer time-frames). However, such systems tend to be analytically intractable. In addition, many can, in theory, support an unlimited number of species. A new paradox is created: Most well-known models that allow for stable coexistence allow for unlimited number of species to coexist, yet, in nature, any community contains just a handful of species.

==Redefinition==

Recent studies addressing some of the assumptions made for the models predicting competitive exclusion have shown these assumptions need to be reconsidered. For example, a slight modification of the assumption of how growth and body size are related leads to a different conclusion, namely that, for a given ecosystem, a certain range of species may coexist while others become outcompeted.

One of the primary ways niche-sharing species can coexist is the competition-colonization trade-off. In other words, species that are better competitors will be specialists, whereas species that are better colonizers are more likely to be generalists. Host-parasite models are effective ways of examining this relationship, using host transfer events. There seem to be two places where the ability to colonize differs in ecologically closely related species. In feather lice, Bush and Clayton provided some verification of this by showing two closely related genera of lice are nearly equal in their ability to colonize new host pigeons once transferred. Harbison continued this line of thought by investigating whether the two genera differed in their ability to transfer. This research focused primarily on determining how colonization occurs and why wing lice are better colonizers than body lice. Vertical transfer is the most common occurrence, between parent and offspring, and is much-studied and well understood. Horizontal transfer is difficult to measure, but in lice seems to occur via phoresis or the &quot;hitchhiking&quot; of one species on another. Harbison found that body lice are less adept at phoresis and excel competitively, whereas wing lice excel in colonization.

Support for a model of competition-colonization trade-off is also found in small mammals related to fire disturbances. In a project focused on the long-term impacts of the 1988 Yellowstone Fires Allen et al. used stable isotopes and spatial mark-recapture data to show that Southern red-backed voles (&quot;Clethrionomys gapperi&quot;)), a specialist, are excluding deer mice (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;), a generalist, from food resources in old-growth forests. However, after wildfire disturbance deer mice are more effective colonizers, and able to take advantage of the release from competitive pressure from voles. This dynamic of establishes a pattern of ecological succession in these ecosystems, with competitive exclusion from voles shaping the amount and quality of resources deer mice can access.

==Phylogenetic context==

An ecological community is the assembly of species which is maintained by ecological (Hutchinson, 1959; Leibold, 1988) and evolutionary process (Weiher and Keddy, 1995; Chase &quot;et al&quot;., 2003). These two processes play an important role in shaping the existing community and will continue in the future (Tofts &quot;et al&quot;., 2000; Ackerly, 2003; Reich &quot;et al&quot;., 2003). In a local community, the potential members are filtered first by environmental factors such as temperature or availability of required resources and then secondly by its ability to co-exist with other resident species.

In an approach of understanding how two species fit together in a community or how the whole community fits together, &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; (Darwin, 1859) proposed that under homogeneous environmental condition struggle for existence is greater between closely related species than distantly related species. He also hypothesized that the functional traits may be conserved across phylogenies. Such strong phylogenetic similarities among closely related species are known as phylogenetic effects (Derrickson &quot;et al&quot;., 1988.)

With field study and mathematical models, ecologists have pieced together a connection between functional traits similarity between species and its effect on species co-existence. According to competitive-relatedness hypothesis (Cahil &quot;et al&quot;., 2008) or phylogenetic limiting similarity hypothesis (Violle &quot;et al&quot;., 2011) interspecific competition is high among the species which have similar functional traits, and which compete for similar resources and habitats. Hence, it causes reduction in the number of closely related species and even distribution of it, known as phylogenetic overdispersion (Webb &quot;et al&quot;., 2002). The reverse of phylogenetic overdispersion is phylogenetic clustering in which case species with conserved functional traits are expected to co-occur due to environmental filtering (Weiher &quot;et al&quot;., 1995; Webb, 2000). In the study performed by Webb &quot;et al&quot;., 2000, they showed that a small-plots of Borneo forest contained closely related trees together. This suggests that closely related species share features that are favored by the specific environmental factors that differ among plots causing phylogenetic clustering.

For both phylogenetic patterns (phylogenetic overdispersion and phylogenetic clustering), the baseline assumption is that phylogenetically related species are also ecologically similar (H. Burns et al., 2011). There are no significant number of experiments answering to what degree the closely related species are also similar in niche. Due to that, both phylogenetic patterns are not easy to interpret. It&#x27;s been shown that phylogenetic overdispersion may also result from convergence of distantly related species (Cavender-Bares &quot;et al.&quot; 2004; Kraft &quot;et al.&quot; 2007). In their study , they have shown that traits are convergent rather than conserved. While, in another study , it&#x27;s been shown that phylogenetic clustering may also be due to historical or bio-geographical factors which prevents species from leaving their ancestral ranges. So, more phylogenetic experiments are required for understanding the strength of species interaction in community assembly.

==Application to humans==

Evidence showing that the competitive exclusion principle operates in human groups has been reviewed and integrated into regality theory to explain warlike and peaceful societies. For example, hunter-gatherer groups surrounded by other hunter-gatherer groups in the same ecological niche will fight, at least occasionally, while hunter-gatherer groups surrounded by groups with a different means of subsistence can coexist peacefully.

Another recent application: in his work &quot;Historical Dynamics,&quot; Peter Turchin developed the so-called &quot;meta-ethnic frontier theory,&quot; wherein both rise and eventual fall of empires derives from geographically and or -politically colliding populations. Accordingly, boundary regions, in which the competitive exclusion principle applies, are supposed to be key to human ethnogenesis. Summarizing its more wide-ranging predictions all in one:&quot;Asabiya&quot; is a concept from the writings of Ibn Khaldun which Turchin defines as “the capacity for collective action” of a society. The Metaethnic Frontier theory is meant to incorporate asabiya as a key factor in predicting the dynamics of imperial agrarian societies - how they grow, shrink, and begin. Turchin posits that multi-level selection can help us identify the dynamics of asabiya in groups. He follows by noting three ways in which the logic of multi-level selection can be relevant in understanding change in “collective solidarity”: intergroup conflict, population and resource constraints, and ethnic boundaries.

For small groups, intergroup conflict can increase asabiya as people need to band together to survive as a group. Conversely (again for small groups), a large population with respect to available resources can decrease asabiya as individuals compete for limited resources. For larger groups, Turchin proposes that ethnic boundries can influence how bands of small groups with moderate ethnic differences can band together against people who are even more “ethnically distanced” - more “Other”. In this process of small groups banding together against peoples more Other than themselves, they can form what Turchin calls a &quot;Metaethnic Frontier&quot; … Turchin notes that the this ethnic boundry dynamic which generates asabiya in a large group (composed of smaller groups) is weak because as the size of the group grows larger, the central regions are less exposed to intergroup conflict and asabiya decreases, leading to greater internal division. Finally, Turchin notes that all three aforementioned possiblities occur at regions which constitute imperial and metaethnic frontiers (imperial and metaethnic frontiers often coincide, he notes). It is in these regions of intense dynamics where asabiya is forged which are most prone to &quot;ethnogenesis.&quot;

<doc id="451121" wikidata="Q19568" url="?curid=451121" title="AFC Bournemouth">
<text>AFC Bournemouth ( ) is a professional association football club based in Kings Park, Boscombe, a suburb of Bournemouth, Dorset, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Formed in 1899 as Boscombe, the club adopted their current name in 1971. Nicknamed &quot;The Cherries&quot;, and commonly referred to as Bournemouth, they have played their home games at Dean Court since 1910. 

The club competed in regional football leagues before going up from the Hampshire League to the Southern League in 1920. Now known as Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic, they were elected into the Football League in 1923. They remained in the Third Division South for 35 years, winning the Third Division South Cup in 1946. Placed in the newly reorganised Third Division in 1958, they suffered relegation in 1970, but would win an immediate promotion in 1970–71. Relegated back into the Fourth Division in 1975, Bournemouth were promoted again in 1981–82 and after lifting the Associate Members&#x27; Cup in 1984 would go on to win the Third Division title in 1986–87. They spent three seasons in the second tier but entered administration in 1997 and ended up back in the fourth tier with relegation in 2002, though immediately gained promotion by winning the play-offs in 2003.

Bournemouth entered administration for a second time and were relegated back into League Two in 2008, but ended the year by appointing Eddie Howe as manager. Under Howe&#x27;s stewardship, Bournemouth won three promotions in six years to win a place in the first tier of English football for the first time in their history. This was achieved with a second-place finish in League Two in 2009–10, a second-place finish in League One in 2012–13 and a Championship title in 2014–15. The club remained in the Premier League for five seasons before suffering relegation in 2020, but they returned in 2022 as Championship runners-up, this time under the management of Scott Parker.

==History==

===Boscombe===
Although the exact date of the club&#x27;s foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John&#x27;s Institute Football Club. The club was originally known as Boscombe Football Club. The first president was Mr. J. C. Nutt.

In their first season, 1899–1900, Boscombe competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons, they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season, the team played on a pitch in King&#x27;s Park. In the 1905–06 season, Boscombe graduated to senior amateur football.

In 1910, the club was granted a long lease over some wasteland next to Kings Park as the club&#x27;s football ground by local businessman J.E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive, and dominated the local football scene. The same year the club signed its first professional player Baven Penton.

Around about this time, the club obtained their nickname &quot;The Cherries&quot;. There are two leading explanations of how the club gained the nickname: from the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in, and, perhaps less plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which, it is believed, may have contained many cherry trees.

For the first time, during the 1913–14 season, the club competed in the FA Cup. The club&#x27;s progress, however, was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I, and Boscombe returned to the Hampshire League.

In 1920, the Third Division of the Football League was formed, and Boscombe were promoted to the Southern League, finding moderate success.

===Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic===
To make the club more representative of the district, the name was changed to Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic Football Club in 1923. During the same year, the club was elected to the newly expanded Third Division South. The first league match was at Swindon Town on 25 August 1923, which Bournemouth lost 3–1. The first league game at Dean Court was also against Swindon, where Bournemouth gained their first league point after a 0–0 draw.

Bournemouth struggled in the Football League but eventually established themselves as a Third Division club. Bournemouth remains on the records as the longest continuous members of the Third Division.

As a league club, Bournemouth had to wait until after the Second World War before winning their first trophy. This was accomplished as they beat Walsall in the Third Division (South) Cup in the final at Stamford Bridge.

===AFC Bournemouth===
The club adopted the name &quot;AFC Bournemouth&quot; for the start of the 1971–72 season, with the intention that the club would appear first in alphabetical lists of English clubs. A year later, the club adopted a new badge as a symbol of its progress. The stripes in the background were based on the club shirt, while in the foreground is the profile of a player heading the ball, in honour of Dickie Dowsett, a prolific scorer for the club in the 1950s and 1960s.

The team&#x27;s red-and-black kit, introduced in 1971, was based on the AC Milan strip. This was the era of Ted MacDougall, a prolific goalscorer who, in an FA Cup tie in November 1971, scored nine goals in an 11–0 win against Margate.

===Late 20th century===
Bournemouth recorded a famous victory over holders Manchester United in the FA Cup in January 1984, while they were managed by Harry Redknapp. The club won its second piece of silverware by winning the Associate Members&#x27; Cup in its inaugural season, beating Hull City 2–1 at Boothferry Park on 24 May 1984 in the final.

Redknapp took Bournemouth into the second tier of the English league for the first time in their history as Third Division champions in 1987. After comfortably surviving in their first season in the Second Division, Bournemouth made a serious challenge for promotion to the top flight in the 1988–89 season; they ultimately fell away after a poor run late in the season, but their eventual finish of 12th place remained their highest-ever in the Football League until the 2013–14 season.

On 5 May 1990, the final day of the 1989–90 season, Leeds United had the chance to win the Second Division and gain promotion into the First Division by beating Bournemouth at Dean Court. Some United fans had already caused trouble in the town during the morning and the atmosphere was tense as Leeds won the match by a single goal. Combined with the results of other matches, this meant that Leeds were promoted while Bournemouth were relegated. The violence and destruction by visitors to Bournemouth continued over the holiday weekend, causing more than £1 million worth of damage and injury to opposing fans and police officers. The town&#x27;s &quot;Daily Echo&quot; newspaper reported that &quot;spectators, including many young children, had to run to safety as missiles were hurled and riot police waded in to control the crowds.&quot; The matter was raised in Parliament by one of the town&#x27;s MPs. Financially, the Leeds trouble affected the club for more than a decade, as Bournemouth were prevented by local police from staging home games on Bank Holidays (traditionally a popular day for football) until a game against Shrewsbury Town on 21 April 2003.

Redknapp remained at the club for two more seasons, both of which ended with the club falling three points short of the play-offs. However, mounting financial pressures caused him to resign his position at the end of the 1991–92 season, and he subsequently re-joined former club West Ham United as a coach. He was replaced by Tony Pulis, who built a much cheaper squad that could only manage two consecutive 17th-place finishes before Pulis walked out of the club, blaming financial pressures.

Bournemouth went the first few months of the 1994–95 season without a permanent manager in place, and a dreadful start saw them bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season. Despite a minor upturn in form when Mel Machin was appointed as manager, they looked highly unlikely to survive, given that there were five relegation spots in Division Two for that season due to league reconstruction. However, a late run of form combined with collapses by relegation rivals Cambridge United and Plymouth Argyle saw them survive on the last day of the season by two points.

Machin ultimately remained in charge for six years, most of which were marked by unremarkable mid-table finishes. The 1998–99 season proved to be arguably the highlight of his tenure, with the club making a serious playoff challenge for most of the season, but ultimately falling short and finishing seventh. However, a drop to 16th place in the 1999–2000 season followed by a poor start to the following season saw Machin removed from his position and given the role of director of football.

===Early 21st century===
Sean O&#x27;Driscoll was promoted from the coaching staff in place of Mel Machin at the start of the 2000–01 season. In O&#x27;Driscoll&#x27;s first season as manager, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the Division Two playoffs but were relegated a year later in the new stadium (in the early part of the 2001–02 season, they played their home matches at Dorchester Town&#x27;s ground while their own stadium was being redeveloped). The board kept faith in O&#x27;Driscoll and they were rewarded with promotion via the Division Three playoffs in 2002–03. The club became the first to score five goals at the Millennium Stadium when they beat Lincoln City 5–2 in the 2002–03 Division Three play-off final with goals from Steve Fletcher, Carl Fletcher (2), Stephen Purches and Garreth O&#x27;Connor. Under O&#x27;Driscoll, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the play-offs for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons, and just avoided relegation in the 2005–06 season.

Long-serving player James Hayter scored the fastest league hat-trick in English Football League history during the 2003–04 season. The Cherries were leading 3–0 against Wrexham thanks to goals from Stephen Purches, Warren Cummings and Warren Feeney when Hayter was brought onto the field as a substitute. With 86 minutes gone, Hayter managed to net three goals in the space of two minutes and 21 seconds, making the final score 6–0 to Bournemouth.

In September 2006, with the team in eighth in the League, Sean O&#x27;Driscoll left to become manager of Doncaster Rovers. He was replaced by Kevin Bond.

===Decline and administration (2008–2009)===
In February 2008, Bournemouth were forced into administration, suffering a ten-point deduction which put them in relegation trouble. Bournemouth had debts of around £4 million and almost went out of business. The off-field uncertainty continued throughout the season, with only one, ultimately unsuccessful, bid for the club accepted, and the club ended the season being relegated to League Two.

Ahead of the 2008–09 season, the team&#x27;s future in the Football League was put into doubt when the league threatened to block Bournemouth&#x27;s participation in League Two, due to problems with the club&#x27;s continuing administration and change in ownership. The league ordered both Bournemouth and Rotherham United to demonstrate that they could fulfil all of their fixtures and find a way out of administration, eventually allowing the club to compete with a 17-point penalty for failing to follow the Football League insolvency rules. The new company was also ordered to pay unsecured creditors the amount offered at the time of the original CVA (around ten pence in the pound) within two years.

Early into the season, manager Bond was sacked and was replaced by former player Jimmy Quinn, who would himself leave the club only a few months later.
Former player Eddie Howe took over as manager with the club still ten points adrift at the bottom of the league and initially on a caretaker basis, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 31.

At the end of 2008, it was announced that local businessman Adam Murray had completed the purchase of 50% of the club&#x27;s shares from previous chairman, Paul Baker. However, in January 2009, Murray missed the deadline to buy Baker&#x27;s shares.

In the final home game of the 2008–09 season, the Cherries guaranteed their Football League status by beating Grimsby Town 2–1 with a winning goal ten minutes from time by Bournemouth&#x27;s Steve Fletcher, sparking wild celebrations after a fairytale ending to &quot;The Great Escape.&quot; They finished their troubled season with their best away win in 30 years with a 4–0 victory at Morecambe.

In June 2009, a consortium including Adam Murry finally took over Bournemouth. The consortium included Jeff Mostyn, former vice-chairman Steve Sly, Neill Blake and former Dorchester Town chairman Eddie Mitchell.

===Rise to the Premier League (2009–2015)===
Howe&#x27;s first full season in charge brought success as Bournemouth finished second in League Two to earn promotion with two games to spare. Howe subsequently left the club for Burnley during the following season; his successor, another former Bournemouth player, Lee Bradbury, led Bournemouth to the League One play-offs. The two-legged semi-final against Huddersfield Town finished 3–3 after extra time, and Huddersfield went through the final by winning the penalty shoot-out 4–2. Bradbury was unable to lead Bournemouth to another promotion challenge in the 2011–12 Football League One, placing 11th after a season of indifferent results, and was replaced by youth team coach Paul Groves for the final games of the season.

Groves remained in charge at the start of the 2012–13 season, only to be sacked in October 2012 following a start which left the club near the bottom of the table. Eddie Howe returned as manager, and not only did he pull the club away from their early-season relegation battle, they achieved promotion to the Championship, returning to the second-tier of English football for the first time since 1990. The club also revealed a new club crest. After a promising start to life in the Championship, the club was handed a fourth Round FA Cup tie with Premier League club Liverpool which ended in a 2–0 loss. Bournemouth finished their first season back in the Championship in tenth place, their highest ever position in the Football League.

On 25 October 2014, Bournemouth won 8–0 away at St. Andrew&#x27;s against Birmingham City. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game and their largest winning margin in the league (not counting a 10–0 win over Northampton Town in September 1939, which was discounted after the league was abandoned due to the Second World War). The club followed up this success with a 2–1 victory over Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in the League Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time. Bournemouth were again drawn against Liverpool but lost 3–1. The club spent most of the 2014–15 season near the top of the table, and a 3–0 win away at Charlton Athletic on the final day of the season was enough to clinch the Championship title and a first-ever promotion to the top flight of English football.

===First Premier League era (2015–2020)===
In Bournemouth&#x27;s first season in the Premier League, the team was beset by a number of crippling injuries, including to Callum Wilson, star striker from the previous season. The team struggled for most of the first half of the season but an upturn in form during the second half of the season saw a reversal of fortunes. Bournemouth eventually finished 16th in the league, avoiding relegation.

The club was widely tipped to suffer second season syndrome, but the 2016–17 season was largely successful. Despite a weak start, which saw them in the relegation zone for the first three weeks, the team quickly recovered and went on to finish 9th. Star loan player Nathan Aké was signed permanently from Chelsea for a club-record fee in June 2017, reportedly in the region of £20 million. Despite another slow start in 2017–18, a run of good form through late December and January saw them steer clear of the relegation zone, and earn Howe his second Premier League Manager of the Month award. Bournemouth went on to gain 19 points from losing positions in the second half of the season – a Premier League record – helping the team finish in 12th place.

The 2018–19 season saw the club break their transfer record again on Jefferson Lerma during the summer, and contrasting with the previous season, the club had a strong start, sitting in 6th place after the first 12 games. However, their form regressed for the remainder of the season due to many injury problems. In the end, Bournemouth finished in 14th place, securing a 5th season in the Premier League.

A bright start to the 2019–20 season saw the team sitting in 7th place at the beginning of November. However, continuing injury problems and a poor run of results followed, and the club dropped into the relegation zone in January. Poor performances continued after the COVID-19 pandemic had interrupted the season, with key losses to Manchester City and Southampton putting the club on the brink. Despite a 3–1 victory over Everton away at Goodison Park on the final day, the club&#x27;s relegation was confirmed because Aston Villa drew against West Ham. On 1 August 2020, Howe left the club by mutual consent, ending his 8-year second spell as manager.

====Financial Fair Play violation and punishment====
In 2016, Bournemouth were found guilty of violating the Football League&#x27;s Financial Fair Play regulations during 2014–15, the season it secured promotion to the Premier League. The club&#x27;s over-spend broke the &#x27;maximum deviation&#x27;, with a £38.3 million financial loss in 2014–15. This followed a loss of £10.3 million in 2013–2014. The club was originally fined £7.6 million by the Football League, but subsequently negotiated a settlement with a fine of £4.75 million for breaching Financial Fair Play rules.

===Back to EFL Championship (2020–2022)===
On 8 August, Jason Tindall, a former Bournemouth player and Howe&#x27;s longtime assistant, was promoted to manager. Despite sitting second in mid-December, Tindall was sacked on 3 February 2021 after a run with one win in eight games, which saw the team fall to 6th in the table. He was replaced by first team coach Jonathan Woodgate, initially as caretaker. Woodgate remained as manager for the remainder of the season, as the club finished in 6th and entered the playoffs, but lost 3–2 to Brentford on aggregate in the semi-final. Woodgate&#x27;s contract was not renewed after the season and on 28 June 2021, former Fulham manager Scott Parker was appointed as the new head coach, with Matt Wells as the assistant coach. Parker led the club on an impressive 15-game unbeaten start to the 2021–22 Championship season, going on to clinch promotion in the penultimate match of the season, a 1–0 victory against promotion rivals Nottingham Forest.

===Second Premier League era (2022–)===
The club&#x27;s return to the Premier League got off to a tough start. A breakdown in the club&#x27;s relationship with Parker and a Premier League record-equalling 9–0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield resulted in Parker&#x27;s dismissal after just four league games on 30 August 2022. First team coach Gary O&#x27;Neil was made interim head coach and presided over an upturn in form in his 12 games in interim charge before being appointed as the permanent head coach on 27 November 2022. 

On 13 December 2022, the club was purchased from previous owner Maxim Demin by Black Knight Football Club, a partnership led by American businessman Bill Foley and Cannae Holdings. The minority ownership group is led by Hollywood actor Michael B. Jordan and Kosmos founder Nullah Sarker. On 19 June 2023, the club announced the departure of manager O&#x27;Neil, with Andoni Iraola coming in to replace him. In the 2023–24 season, Bournemouth, led by Iraola, achieved their best points tally in the Premier League, accumulating 48 points to finish 12th.

==Colours==

The team&#x27;s colours have varied slightly throughout the club&#x27;s history. Starting off playing in red-and-white stripes, Bournemouth have also played in all-red shirts, red with white sleeves, and mostly, since 1990, in red-and-black stripes. A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons, but – due to fan demand – a return was made to the stripes for the 2006–07 season.

Since 2017 Bournemouth&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Umbro. Previously it has been made by Umbro (1974–78, 1983–86), Adidas (1978–81), Osca (1982–83), Henson (1986–87), Scoreline (1987–90), Ellgren (1990–92), Matchwinner (1993–95), Le Coq Sportif (1995–96), Patrick (1996–2000), Super League (2000–01), TFG Sportswear (2001–03), Bourne Red (2003–08), Carbrini Sportswear (2008–11, 2014–15), Fila (2011–14) and JD Sports (2015–17).

For the 2024–25 season, the team&#x27;s shirts are sponsored by bj88, with LEOS International as the shirt sleeve sponsor. Before this, sponsors have been Reg Heynes Toyota (1980–82, 1983–85), Coopers Beers (1985–87), Canberra Homes (1987–88), Nolan (1988–89), A1 Windscreens (1990–92), Exchange &amp; Mart (1992–94), Frizzell (1994–97), Seward (1997–2006), Focal Point (2006–08, 2011–12), Carbrini Sportswear (2008–11), Energy Consulting (2012–15), Mansion (2015–2020), Vitality (2020), MSP Capital (2020–2022) and Dafabet (2022–2024). From the 2017–2018 season until the 2019–20 season, the Mansion logo appeared on the left shirt sleeve of Bournemouth&#x27;s shirts, in addition DeWalt was shirt sleeve sponsor from the 2022–23 season until the 2023–24 season.

==Rivalries==
According to a recent poll named &#x27;The League of Love and Hate&#x27; in August 2019, Bournemouth supporters named their club&#x27;s near neighbour Southampton as its biggest rival, with Portsmouth, Brighton and Hove Albion, Reading and Leeds United following.

==Records and statistics==

Steve Fletcher holds the record for Bournemouth appearances, having played 726 first-team matches between 1992 and 2013. He also holds the record for most League appearances, making 628. Ron Eyre holds the record for the most goals 229 in a Bournemouth shirt having played 337 first-team matches between 1924 and 1933. Ted MacDougall holds the record for the most goals scored in a single season, 42 in the 1970–71 season in the Fourth Division.

The highest transfer fee received for a Bournemouth player to date is £65 million, from Tottenham Hotspur for Dominic Solanke in August 2024, whilst the highest transfer fee paid by the club to date is £40.2 million, for Evanilson from Porto, also in August 2024.

The club&#x27;s highest ever league finish to date is 9th place in the Premier League, achieved in the 2016–17 season.

<text>Brentford Football Club is a professional association football club based in Brentford, West London, England. The team competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed &quot;The Bees&quot;, the club was founded in 1889 and played home matches at Griffin Park from 1904 before moving to the Brentford Community Stadium in 2020.

Brentford initially played amateur football before they entered the London League in 1896 and finished as runners-up of the Second Division and then the First Division to win election into the Southern League in 1898. They won the Southern League Second Division in 1900–01 and were elected into the Football League in 1920. Brentford won the Third Division South title in 1932–33 and the Second Division title in 1934–35. The club enjoyed a successful spell in the top flight of English football, reaching a peak of fifth in the First Division, in 1935–36, their highest ever league finish, before three relegations left them in the Fourth Division by 1962. They were crowned Fourth Division champions in 1962–63, but were relegated in 1966 and again in 1973 after gaining promotion in 1971–72. Brentford spent 14 seasons in the Third Division after gaining promotion in 1977–78 and went on to win the Third Division title in 1991–92, though were relegated again in 1993.

Brentford were relegated into the fourth tier in 1998 and won promotion as champions in the 1998–99 campaign. The club were relegated in 2007 and won promotion as champions of League Two in 2008–09 and then were promoted out of League One in 2013–14. They had unsuccessful Championship play-off campaigns in 2015 and 2020. Brentford have a poor record in finals, finishing as runners-up in three Associate Members&#x27; Cup/Football League Trophy finals (1985, 2001 and 2011) and losing four play-off finals (the 1997 Second Division final, 2002 Second Division final, 2013 League One final and 2020 Championship final). However, Brentford won the 2021 Championship final to be promoted to the highest level for the first time since the 1946–47 season. Their main rivals are fellow West London-based clubs Fulham and Queens Park Rangers. They are affiliated with the women&#x27;s club Brentford Women.

==History==

===1889–1920: Formation and early years===
In 1889, the town of Brentford, Middlesex was home to the Brentford Rowing Club and Boston Park Cricket Club. Attempts to form football and rugby clubs in the town fell by the wayside until a new recreation ground was opened on 17 October 1889. Seven days earlier, a meeting had taken place at the Oxford &amp; Cambridge pub near Kew Bridge, during which it had been endeavoured between the rowing and cricket club members to decide how best to use the recreation ground. On 16 October 1889, the rowing club members again met at the Oxford &amp; Cambridge pub and it was voted that the new club would play association football, be named &quot;Brentford Football Club&quot;.

On 26 October 1889, the club staged its first practice match and on 23 November the club&#x27;s first competitive match was played versus Kew, which resulted in a 1–1 draw. The 1892–93 season saw Brentford enter a league for the first time — the West London Alliance. The 1894–95 season was when Brentford first got their nickname, The Bees. A group of people from Borough Road College had come to a match to support their friend Joseph Gettins who was playing for Brentford at the time. They shouted their school chant, &#x27;Buck up Bs!&#x27; but it was misheard by the media as &#x27;Buck up bees!&#x27;, and the name stuck.

Brentford continued to largely play cup and friendly matches until 1896, when the club was elected into the Second Division of the London League. The Bees finished second to secure promotion to the First Division. Brentford&#x27;s London League exploits and its establishment as one of the top amateur clubs in London led to the club&#x27;s election into the Second Division (London section) of the Southern League for the 1898–99 season. The club became a professional outfit in the 1899–1900 season and won a place in the top-flight in July 1901 after Gravesend United dropped out of the Southern League.

Brentford moved to Griffin Park, its first permanent home, in time for the beginning of the 1904–05 season. The Bees reached the FA Cup first round proper for the first time in 1905–06, advancing to the third round before succumbing to Liverpool at Anfield. Despite an initial upturn in form, 9 defeats in the final 11 matches of 1912–13 led to Brentford&#x27;s relegation after an 11-season stay in the First Division.

In July 1915, the Southern League cancelled its competition for the duration of the First World War. Brentford competed in the London Combination during the War. The squad was decimated by the call-up of players for service or war work. Brentford won the London Combination title in 1918–19, four points ahead of nearest challengers Arsenal. Brentford turned down the opportunity to apply for election to the Football League for the 1919–20 season and instead applied for election to the First Division of the Southern League, which was awarded, finishing 15th.

===1920–1954: Establishment in the Football League and glory years===
In May 1920, Brentford and 20 other Southern League First Division clubs were elected into the Football League as founder members of the Third Division for the 1920–21 season. 11 new players were signed and the Bees&#x27; first-ever Football League match took place on 28 August 1920 at Exeter City&#x27;s St James Park, which resulted in a 3–0 defeat. Despite 18 goals from Harry King, a lack of goals from elsewhere in the side led Brentford to a 21st-place finish, but the club were re-elected into the league without going to a poll.

It was all change at Griffin Park during the 1926 off-season, with former Gillingham boss Harry Curtis being installed as manager. Just 9 members of the previous season&#x27;s squad were retained, but despite mid-table finishes over the following three seasons, Curtis slowly rebuilt the squad. The 1929–30 Third Division South season provided the foundation for the Bees&#x27; future success, however, the club missed out on promotion to Plymouth Argyle. The Bees romped to the 1932–33 Third Division South title, with Jack Holliday scoring a club-record 39 goals.

After topping the table for the third time in the 1934–35 season on 2 March 1935, the Bees would not again relinquish top spot, cruising to the title and promotion to the First Division for the first time in the club&#x27;s history. Brentford also completed a unique double by winning the London Challenge Cup. After having risen from the third-tier to the first in the space of just three seasons, manager Harry Curtis elected to keep his squad intact for the 1935–36 First Division season. An extension to the New Road terrace increased Griffin Park&#x27;s capacity to 40,000, which would generate extra income. After 15 matches, Brentford looked certain to be relegated, however, the club completed a remarkable turnaround, with the Bees losing just two of the final 23 matches and finishing in the club&#x27;s all-time-highest position of 5th. Brentford again performed above expectations during the 1936–37 and 1937–38 seasons, finishing 6th in each campaign and reaching the FA Cup sixth round for the first time in the latter. The club reached its zenith between October 1937 and February 1938, holding onto top spot in the First Division for 17 consecutive matches.

The 1938–39 season was the beginning of the end of Brentford&#x27;s peak; narrowly avoiding relegation. The 1939–40 season lasted just three matches before World War Two brought about the suspension of competitive football. Brentford competed in the Football League South and the London War League during the war years, with much of the team supplemented by guests and young amateurs, though the core of the pre-war team continued to play in the majority of the club&#x27;s matches. On 30 May 1942, the Bees earned a 2–0 victory over Portsmouth in the London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

Brentford&#x27;s 1946–47 squad, for the first competitive season after the Second World War, was propped up by the ageing core of the 1939–40 pre-war squad which would lead to the Bees&#x27; relegation from the First Division. After narrowly avoiding a second successive relegation in 1947–48, manager Harry Curtis announced that the 1948–49 season would be his last in the job after nearly 23 years. The season ended with a poor 18th-place finish, though notably the FA Cup sixth round fixture at home to Leicester City set a new club-record attendance of 38,678. In 1953–54 Brentford&#x27;s relegation to the Third Division South was confirmed on the final day of the season after a 3–1 defeat to Leicester City at Griffin Park.

===1954–1986: Decline and financial difficulties===
Relegation to the Third Division South at the end of the 1953–54 season meant that 1954–55 would be Brentford&#x27;s first in the bottom-tier for 21 years. After three consecutive top-six finishes, the rot set in during the 1960–61 season, with the poor form on the field mirrored by the news from the boardroom of debts of £50,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025).

After the sale of several key players, the Bees finished second-from-bottom of the 1961–62 Third Division and were relegated, starting several yo-yo years between the Third and Fourth divisions. Despite winning just seven of the final 14 matches of the season, Brentford finished 1962–63 as Fourth Division champions. However, in 1965–66, Billy Gray couldn&#x27;t prevent relegation to the Fourth Division. In December 1966, it was revealed by chairman Dunnett at Brentford&#x27;s AGM that the club had lost £20,000 during the previous financial year and that he would be selling his stake in the club. Earlier that month, there had been an approach from neighbours QPR, suggesting that the two clubs share Griffin Park. On 19 January 1967, the news broke that Dunnett and his QPR counterpart Jim Gregory had reached an agreement that Brentford&#x27;s rivals would move into Griffin Park, Rangers&#x27; ground Loftus Road would be redeveloped as housing and Brentford, as a club, would cease to exist.

After a tense month of fan protests, negotiations and donations amounting to £8,500 (equivalent to £ in 2025), a six-man syndicate headed by former Plymouth Argyle chairman Ron Blindell took over Dunnett&#x27;s shares on 23 February 1967 and guaranteed a 12-month bridging loan of £104,000. The following day, Blindell, as chairman, took control of the club. It transpired that QPR chairman Jim Gregory had resurrected his interest in Griffin Park and offered £250,000 for the use of the ground, a fee that would wipe out Brentford&#x27;s £135,000 debt instantly, if the club moved to Hillingdon. The name &quot;Brentford Borough FC&quot; had already been chosen for the new Hillingdon-based club, but once again Brentford was saved at the eleventh hour, with former director Walter Wheatley granting the club a £69,000 interest-free loan, repayable in 12 months.

Under Frank Blunstone, Brentford secured promotion back to the Third Division with two matches of the season remaining. However, the Bees were relegated on the final day of the 1972–73 season. After a period of consolidation, Bill Dodgin Jr. led Brentford to a 4th-place finish and promotion to the Third Division in the 1977–78 season. Brentford reached its first major competitive cup final in the 1984–85 season, but lost 3–1 against Wigan Athletic in the 1985 Football League Trophy final at Wembley Stadium. In the 1988–89 season, the Bees&#x27; reached the sixth round of the FA Cup, which ended after a 4–0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield.

===1986–2014===
In 1991–92, six wins from the six final matches saw Brentford recover to win the Third Division championship on the final day and secure second-tier football for the first time since the 1953–54 season. However, Brentford returned immediately to the third tier. In 1996–97, Brentford missed out on promotion, losing the play-off final against Crewe Alexandra. In the 1997–98 season, Brentford were relegated to the Third Division on the final day of the season.

In June 1998, former Crystal Palace chairman Ron Noades assumed ownership of Brentford and made wholesale changes throughout the club, installing himself as chairman-manager. The Bees won the 1998–99 Third Division championship on the final day, after beating Cambridge United 1–0 in a &quot;winner takes all&quot; match at the Abbey Stadium. Brentford reached the 2001 Football League Trophy final, but were defeated 2–1 by Port Vale. At the end of the 2001–02 season, Brentford narrowly missed out on automatic promotion on the final day to Reading. The Bees could only manage a draw in a must win match, before later losing the 2002 play-off final, to Stoke City, 2–0.

In the wake of the ITV Digital collapse, the financial restraints placed on the club by Noades left new manager Wally Downes with an inexperienced squad and administration was narrowly avoided in August 2002. Noades quit the club and handed control to supporters&#x27; trust Bees United. Brentford narrowly avoided relegation at the end of the 2003–04 season. In both 2004–05 and 2005–06, Brentford reached the FA Cup fifth round and the play-off semi-finals. In 2006, Matthew Benham made his first interaction with Brentford, donating £500,000. He was anonymous and was known as the &#x27;Mysterious Investor&#x27;. Despite a good start to the 2006–07 season, Brentford&#x27;s relegation was confirmed on 9 April 2007, eventually finishing bottom of the league. Despite the relegation, the club&#x27;s finances had been improved after Matthew Benham paid nearly £3 million to take over some of the club&#x27;s debts in January 2007.

In July 2009, Benham and Bees United made a deal under the codename &#x27;Gecko&#x27; in which he agreed to give £1m every year for 5 years, in return for increasing his equity to 35% and have an option to become the owner of Brentford by 2014. Under Andy Scott, the Bees won the League Two title after victory in the penultimate match of the 2009–10 season. 2010–11 became memorable for Brentford&#x27;s cup exploits, going on a run to the fourth round of the League Cup and reaching the 2011 Football League Trophy final, which was lost 1–0 to Carlisle United. In June 2012, Benham fully bought the club from Bees United. However, Bees United still keep a place on the club board. Brentford came within a penalty kick of automatic promotion to the Championship on the final day of the 2012–13 season, losing 1–0 to promotion rivals Doncaster Rovers at Griffin Park, who only needed a draw to secure automatic promotion. The Bees would eventually lose to Yeovil Town in the play-off final. Despite a poor start to the season, Mark Warburton led the Bees to automatic promotion to the Championship in 2014.

===2014–present: Rise to the Premier League===
In their first season in the second tier since 1993, Brentford finished 5th but lost to Middlesbrough in the play-off semi-finals. Under Dean Smith, Brentford became an established Championship side. Smith&#x27;s successor, Thomas Frank, took Brentford to the 2020 Championship play-off final after finishing third in the league, but lost 2–1 to West London rivals Fulham. During the 2020 off-season, the club moved out of Griffin Park (its home ground for 116 years) and into the Brentford Community Stadium, a 17,250-capacity all-seater stadium. Brentford repeated their third-place finish during the 2020–21 regular season and went one better in the play-offs, securing promotion to the Premier League with a 2–0 victory over Swansea City in the 2021 Championship play-off final. Brentford played in the top division of English football for the first time in 74 years. Frank guided his side to 13th, 9th and 16th-placed finishes in Brentford&#x27;s first three Premier League campaigns.

==Nickname==
Brentford&#x27;s nickname is &quot;The Bees&quot;. The nickname was unintentionally created by students of Borough Road College in the 1890s, when they attended a match and shouted the college&#x27;s chant &quot;buck up Bs&quot; in support of their friend and then-Brentford player Joseph Gettins. Local newspapers misheard the chant as &quot;Buck up Bees&quot; and the nickname stuck.

==Colours and badge==

Brentford&#x27;s predominant home colours are a red and white striped shirt, black shorts and red or black socks. These have been the club&#x27;s predominant home colours since the 1925–26 season, bar one season – 1960–61 – when yellow (gold) and blue were used, unsuccessfully. The colours on entering the Football League, in 1920–21, were white shirts, navy shorts and navy socks. Away kits have varied over the years, with the current colours being a sky blue shirt, navy shorts and sky blue socks. It features the popular &#x27;castle&#x27; badge of the 1970s and 80&#x27;s.

Brentford have had several badges on their shirts since it was formed in 1889. The first one, in 1893, was a white shield, with &#x27;BFC&#x27; in blue and a wavy line in blue, which is thought to represent the river and the rowing club, who founded the football club. The next known badge, the Middlesex County Arms, was on shirts donated by a club supporter in 1909. The Brentford and Chiswick arms, as a badge, was used just for the one season, in 1938–39. The next badge was in 1971–72 when a shield, formed into quadrants, which had a hive and bees in one, 3 seaxes in another and the other two with red and white stripes. In 1972, the club organised a competition to design a new crest, which was won by Mr B.G. Spencer&#x27;s design, a circle with a bee and stripes and the founding date of 1888. This was introduced in 1973 and used until May 1975, when it was brought to the club&#x27;s attention, via Graham Haynes, that the club was formed in 1889 and not in 1888. Therefore, a new badge, reputedly designed by Dan Tana – the club&#x27;s chairman at the time – was introduced for the 1975–76 season and continued until 1994 when the current badge was introduced. In 2011 Russell Grant claimed to have designed the badge in a BBC interview; however, it was in fact designed in 1993 for two season tickets by supporter Andrew Henning, following a request from Keith Loring, the then chief executive. In 2017, the club redesigned its crest to a more modern, uncluttered, design with the flexibility for use in two tone colour print. The design is a double roundel with the club name and year founded in white on a red background and a large central bee.

==Rivalries==

Brentford&#x27;s main rivals are Fulham, Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Fulham. In the past this fixture has been marred by crowd violence. Brentford&#x27;s rivalry with Queens Park Rangers intensified in 1967, when Rangers failed in an attempted takeover of the Bees, a move which, had it succeeded, would have seen Rangers move into Griffin Park and Brentford quit the Football League. As with the Fulham and Chelsea rivalries, this fixture sees passions run high amongst both sets of supporters with local pride at stake.

==International links==
In February 2013, it was announced that Brentford had entered into partnership with Icelandic 1. deild karla club UMF Selfoss, which would enable Brentford to send youth and development squad players to Iceland to gain experience. The partnership also sees the two clubs exchanging coaching philosophies and allows Brentford to utilise UMF Selfoss&#x27; scouting network. In May 2013, the Brentford staff forged links with Ugandan lower league club Gulu United as part of the &quot;United for United&quot; project, aimed at forming the region&#x27;s first youth training camp and identifying talented players. Brentford owner Matthew Benham became majority shareholder in Danish club FC Midtjylland in 2014 and the staff of both clubs share ideas. In 2023, Benham sold FC Midtjylland to Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, therefore, they are now no longer sister clubs.
