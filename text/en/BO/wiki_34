<text>The Latrobe Valley is an inland geographical district and urban area of the Gippsland region in the state of Victoria, Australia. The traditional owners are the Brayakaulung of the Gunai nation. The district lies east of Melbourne and nestled between the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and the Baw Baw Ranges, part of the Great Dividing Range, to the north. Mount St Phillack () is the highest peak to the north of the Latrobe Valley, due north of Moe. The highest peak to the south is Mt Tassie (), south of Traralgon.

The area has three major centres, from west to east, , Morwell and Traralgon, with minor centres including , , , and . The population of the Latrobe Valley is approximately 125,000.

The valley draws its name from the Latrobe River which flows eastward, through the valley. According to Les Blake, in 1841 William Adams Brodribb, an early European settler, named the river in honour of Charles La Trobe, Lieutenant Governor of the Port Phillip District. A. W. Reed also attributes Brodribb to naming the river in honour of La Trobe; yet Reed claims that the river was discovered by Angus McMillan in 1840 who named the watercourse as Glengarry River.

==Geography==
While the Latrobe River flows into Lake Wellington to the east of and includes in its drainage basin a significant part of central Gippsland, the region conventionally known as the Latrobe Valley occupies an inland area between the Strzelecki Ranges and Baw Baw Ranges between Drouin and Rosedale – with three major urban areas Moe, Morwell and Traralgon, between the Strzelecki Ranges to the south and the westernmost reaches of the Victorian Alps to the north.

==Climate==
It has a temperate climate meaning mild temperatures with large amounts of rain, the occasional frost and snow on neighbouring hills. February is the warmest month in the Latrobe Valley with an average temperature range of and the coldest month is July with an average temperature range of . The most rain occurs in late winter and spring, and average yearly rainfall is approximately .

Temperatures on Mount Baw Baw, to the north of Moe, generally peak around cooler than the major urban areas during the day.

==Demographics==
There are three major population centres in the Latrobe Valley, all located within the City of Latrobe local government area:

* Moe west Latrobe Valley
* Morwellcentral Latrobe Valley
* Traralgoneastern Latrobe Valley

The primary hospital is the Latrobe Regional Hospital located on the Princes Highway in Traralgon.

Smaller towns are Tyers, Newborough, Yinnar, Yallourn North, Churchill (site of the local campus of Federation University) and Boolarra.

==Economy==
Key industry sectors include health care, power generation, retail, paper manufacture, timber mills, agriculture, dairy, timber, information technology, engineering and education. The valley provides 85% of Victoria&#x27;s electricity and has a substantial engineering sector supporting the power generation, pulp and paper production and food processing industries, etc. The tertiary education sector attracts local, interstate and international students.

Despite its outside image as a regional economy dominated by mining and electricity, the region employs more hospital and aged care workers than power industry workers and has important service, health care and education sectors. Hospitals are the largest employer in the regional economy at 5% of the workforce, followed by power industry workers at 4.2%, supermarket and grocery store workers at 3%, and aged care workers at 2.9%.

Logging is also an important industry in the hills to the north and south, with a major paper mill located at Maryvale, near Morwell. In the rugged north of the region is located the historic gold-mining town of Walhalla, amid mountains forming the west of Alpine National Park and nearby Baw Baw National Park, which includes a small winter ski resort.

===Industry===


The Latrobe Valley is significant as the centre of Victoria&#x27;s energy industry, specifically the mining and burning of brown coal to produce electricity. The area produces a total of approximately 85% of the electricity for the entire state of Victoria and supplies some electricity to New South Wales and Tasmania. The valley is home to four of the highest electricity producing thermal power stations in Australia. Power plants located in the Latrobe Valley include Loy Yang Power Stations A &amp; B, Yallourn Power Station, Jeeralang Power Station (Gas) plus the former Hazelwood Power Station (closed 2017) and Energy Brix Power Station (closed August 2014). The Latrobe power stations emit more mercury than hard coal stations.

==Governance==
Local government within the Latrobe Valley is administered by the Latrobe City Council and the Baw Baw Shire Council.

Latrobe City LGA has a population of approximately 75,000 with four major population centres: Moe, Morwell, Churchill and Traralgon, with smaller townships including Boolarra, Glengarry, Toongabbie, Tyers, Traralgon South, Yallourn North, and Yinnar, with the administrative headquarters located in Morwell.

==Transport==
The Princes Freeway runs through Latrobe Valley, bypassing most major rural cities and connecting the region to both Melbourne and East Gippsland. The centrally located centre of Moe is approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes drive from the central business district of Melbourne.

V/Line runs a rail service from metropolitan Melbourne to the Latrobe Valley and also runs services that go through the Latrobe Valley to East Gippsland. Some rail services run limited express to the Latrobe Valley – stopping in the major population centres of Warragul, Moe, Morwell and Traralgon. Other services – including the Gippslander rail service – stop at all stations in the area. Services to the Latrobe Valley run between Melbourne and Traralgon, whilst Gippsland services run between Melbourne and Bairnsdale. The Latrobe Valley/Gippsland rail line is connected to the metropolitan Melbourne Pakenham line.

Latrobe Valley Bus Lines are operated by Valley Transit, which runs connecting bus services in the Latrobe Valley area between Moe and Traralgon – consisting of inter-city services that run between Moe and Traralgon to nearby towns such as Morwell, Churchill and Yallourn North – and connecting town services that run in each major centre.

Latrobe Valley Airport (IATA: LTB, ICAO: YLTV) is located in the Latrobe Valley approximately two hours east of Melbourne, off Princes Highway, on the west side of Traralgon.

==Education==
The Gippsland campus of Federation University is home to on-campus students, off-campus students and nearly 400 staff. The campus sits in the Latrobe Valley town of Churchill, east of Melbourne on of landscaped grounds. The campus offers many undergraduate degrees, and attracts many students from the Latrobe Valley, East and West Gippsland. The Centre for Gippsland Studies is a research and community engagement facility which has conducted research and community outreach since 1985.

The Gippsland Medical School, offering postgraduate entry Bachelor of Medicine / Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) courses was officially opened by the Federal Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon on 5 June 2008, providing students with an opportunity to learn medicine in a rural setting working with rural practitioners. The Gippsland Medical School was subject to some local criticism in 2016 and 2017 when it was revealed that there were only 12 Gippsland-origin students among the cohort of 50 studying medicine at the regional campus. The only direct pathway to the medical degree was through a course offered at Monash University&#x27;s Melbourne-based Clayton campus, whilst graduates from Federation University in Gippsland were not offered a direct pathway to the degree. Federal Member for Gippsland, Darren Chester, criticised Monash University arguing that: &#x27;We should not be saying to our students who are completing year 12 this year that they have to move to Melbourne to access the Monash graduate medical program when we had an existing pathway in Gippsland.&#x27;

<text>Broadcasting House (BH) is a current affairs programme produced by BBC News for BBC Radio 4, presented by Paddy O&#x27;Connell, with Jonny Dymond regularly appearing as a relief presenter. It was launched on 19 April 1998 and is broadcast every Sunday between 9am and 10am.

There used to be a weekly quiz, with a cryptic sound clue pointing to a news event in the last week. The prize was a spoon, originally a jam spoon, but then replaced by a honey spoon. The programme made frequent visits to the &quot;BH beehive&quot; in southwest London. The competition was nominated for a Sony Award in 2007.

More serious features include the headlines and current affairs sections, which look at the background to recent news stories. There is also a review of the Sunday papers with guest reviewers. The BBC newsreaders work on a five-week rotation and are as follows: Chris Aldridge, Corrie Corfield, Neil Sleat, Zeb Soanes and Diana Speed.

&quot;Broadcasting House&quot;″s original presenter was Eddie Mair, who left the programme on becoming the regular sole presenter of &quot;PM&quot; in 2003. After a period with no regular presenter, Fi Glover replaced Mair at the beginning of 2004. Matthew Bannister was the first stand-in presenter when Glover went on maternity leave, but on gaining his own new obituary strand on Radio 4, &quot;Last Word&quot;, most editions of &quot;BH&quot; in the spring/summer of 2006 were presented by &quot;Working Lunch&quot; and BBC Three presenter Paddy O&#x27;Connell. Glover did not return, instead taking on the Saturday 9am slot with &quot;Saturday Live&quot;, and on 30 August 2006, O&#x27;Connell was named as the new regular host of &quot;BH&quot;.

<text>Sir Samuel Roy Meadow (born 9 June 1933) is a British retired paediatrician who facilitated several wrongful convictions of mothers for murdering their babies. He was awarded the Donald Paterson prize of the British Paediatric Association in 1968 for a study of the effects on parents of having a child in hospital. In 1977, he published an academic paper describing a phenomenon dubbed Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSbP). In 1980 he was awarded a professorial chair in paediatrics at St James&#x27;s University Hospital, Leeds, and in 1998, he was knighted for services to child health.

His work became controversial, particularly arising from the consequences of a belief he stated in his 1997 book &quot;ABC of Child Abuse&quot; that, in a single family, &quot;one sudden infant death is a tragedy, two is suspicious and three is murder, until proved otherwise&quot;. This became known as &quot;Meadow&#x27;s law&quot; and was influential in the thinking of UK social workers and child protection agencies, such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

Meadow&#x27;s reputation was severely damaged after his appearances as an expert witness for the prosecution in several trials played a crucial part in wrongful convictions for murder. Despite having fundamental misunderstandings of statistics, he presented himself as an expert in the field. Meadow&#x27;s miscalculations significantly contributed towards the wrongful imprisonment of innocent mothers whom he branded murderers. The British General Medical Council (GMC) struck him from the British Medical Register after he was found to have offered erroneous and misleading evidence in the 1999 trial of Sally Clark, who was wrongly convicted of the murder of her two baby sons. Clark&#x27;s conviction was overturned in 2003 but she never recovered from the experience, and died in 2007 from acute alcohol poisoning.

Clark&#x27;s father, Frank Lockyer, complained to the GMC, alleging serious professional misconduct on the part of Meadow. The GMC concluded in July 2005 that Meadow was guilty, but he appealed to the High Court, which in February 2006 ruled in his favour. The GMC appealed to the Court of Appeal, but in October 2006, by a majority decision, the court upheld the ruling that Meadow was not guilty of the GMC&#x27;s charge. The reason was that his behaviour in court did not impact his care for his own patients.

==Career==
Meadow was born in Wigan, Lancashire, the son of Samuel and Doris Meadow. He was educated at Wigan Grammar School and Bromsgrove School, before studying medicine at Worcester College, Oxford. From 1962 to 1964 he practised as a general practitioner in Banbury, Oxfordshire, before progressing to junior appointments at various hospitals in London and Brighton. In 1967 he became a Medical Research Council Fellow at the University of Birmingham, and three years later was appointed senior lecturer and consultant paediatrician at the University of Leeds. Meadow was appointed professor of paediatrics and child health at Leeds in 1980, based at St James&#x27;s University Hospital. He retired with the title Emeritus Professor in 1998.

Throughout his early years in medicine, Meadow was a devoted admirer of Anna Freud (daughter of Sigmund Freud), whose lectures he would often attend. Speaking in later life, he said: &quot;I was, as a junior, brought up by Anna Freud, who was a great figure in child psychology, and I used to sit at her feet at Maresfield Gardens in Hampstead. She used to teach us that a child needs mothering and not a mother.&quot; There is some controversy over these claims. According to the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, representatives of the Anna Freud Centre claimed to have no record of him completing a formal training there and repudiated his description of her philosophy.

In 1961, Meadow married Gillian Maclennan, daughter of Sir Ian Maclennan, the British ambassador to Ireland. The couple had two children, Julian and Anna, before divorcing in 1974. Four years later he married his second wife, Marianne Jane Harvey.

==Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy==

In 1977, in &quot;The Lancet&quot; medical journal, Meadow published the theory which was to make him famous.
Sufferers of his postulated Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy or MSbP (a name coined by Meadow himself) harm or fake symptoms of illness in persons under their care (usually their own children) in order to gain the attention and sympathy of medical personnel. This claim was based upon the extraordinary behaviour of two mothers: one had (Meadow claimed) poisoned her toddler with excessive quantities of salt. The other had introduced her own blood into her baby&#x27;s urine sample. Although it was initially regarded with scepticism, MSbP soon gained a following amongst doctors and social workers.

==Expert testimony==

In 1993, Meadow gave expert testimony at the trial of Beverley Allitt, a paediatric nurse accused (and later found guilty) of murdering several of her patients.

Meadow went on to testify in many other trials, many of which concerned cases previously diagnosed as cot death or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Meadow was convinced that many apparent cot deaths were the result of physical abuse. Families that had suffered more than one cot death were to attract particular attention: &quot;There is no evidence that cot deaths runs in families&quot;, said Meadow, &quot;but there is plenty of evidence that child abuse does&quot;. His rule of thumb was that &quot;unless proven otherwise, one cot death is tragic, two is suspicious and three is murder&quot;.

Although this dictum is believed not to have originated from Meadow&#x27;s own lips, it has become almost universally known as Meadow&#x27;s law.

==Cot death trial controversies==
This trend was to reach its apogee in 1999 when solicitor Sally Clark was tried for allegedly murdering her two babies. Her elder son Christopher had died at the age of 11 weeks, and her younger son Harry at 8 weeks. Medical opinion was divided on the cause of death, and several leading paediatricians testified that the deaths were probably natural. Experts acting for the prosecution initially diagnosed that the babies had been shaken to death, but three days before the trial began several of them changed their collective opinion to smothering.

By the time he gave evidence at Sally Clark&#x27;s trial, Meadow claimed to have found 81 cot deaths which were in fact murder, but he had destroyed the data. Amongst the prosecution team was Meadow, whose evidence included a soundbite which was to provoke much argument: he testified that the odds against two cot deaths occurring in the same family was 73,000,000:1, a figure which he erroneously obtained by squaring the observed ratio of live-births to cot deaths in affluent non-smoking families (approximately 8,500:1). In addition he extrapolated his erroneous figures stating that the 1 in 73,000,000 incidence was only likely to occur once every hundred years in England, Scotland and Wales. He further illustrated his miscalculation by stating that the very unlikely odds were the same as successfully backing to win an 80/1 outsider in the Grand National for four successive years. The jury returned a 10/2 majority verdict of &quot;guilty&quot;.

==Misuse of statistics==
Meadow&#x27;s 73,000,000:1 statistic was paraded in the popular press and received criticism from professional statisticians over its calculation. The Royal Statistical Society issued a press release stating that the figure had &quot;no statistical basis&quot;, and that the case was &quot;one example of a medical expert witness making a serious statistical error.&quot; The Society&#x27;s president, Professor Peter Green, later wrote an open letter of complaint to the Lord Chancellor about these concerns.

The statistical criticisms were threefold: firstly, Meadow was accused of applying the so-called prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy in which the probability of &quot;cause given effect&quot; (i.e. the true likelihood of a suspect&#x27;s innocence) is confused with that of &quot;effect given cause&quot; (the probability that an innocent person would lose two children in this manner). In reality, these quantities can only be equated when the &quot;a priori&quot; likelihood of the alternative hypothesis, in this case murder, is close to certainty. Murder (especially double murder) is itself a rare event, whose probability must be weighed against that of the null hypothesis (natural death).

The second criticism concerned the ecological fallacy: Meadow&#x27;s calculation had assumed that the cot death probability within any single family was the same as the aggregate ratio of cot deaths to births for the entire affluent-non-smoking population. No account had been taken of conditions specific to individual families (such as the hypothesised cot death gene) which might make some more vulnerable than others. Finally, Meadow assumed that SIDS cases within families were statistically independent. The occurrence of one cot death makes it likely that the family in question has such conditions, and the probability of subsequent deaths is therefore greater than the group average. (Estimates are mostly in the region of 1:100.)

Some mathematicians have estimated that taking all these factors into account, the &quot;true&quot; odds may have been greater than 2:1 in favour of the death not being murder, and hence demonstrating Clark&#x27;s innocence.

The perils of allowing non-statisticians to present unsound statistical arguments were expressed in a British Medical Journal (BMJ) editorial by Stephen Watkins, Director of Public Health for Stockport, claiming that &quot;defendants deserve the same protection as patients.&quot;

==Sally Clark appeals==

Meadow&#x27;s statistical figure was amongst the five grounds for appeal submitted to the Court of Appeal in the autumn of 2000. The judges claimed that the figure was a &quot;sideshow&quot;, which would have had no significant effect on the jury&#x27;s decision. The overall evidence was judged to be &quot;overwhelming&quot; and Clark&#x27;s appeal against conviction was dismissed. Clark&#x27;s supporters rejected this decision. Meadow considered that he had been fully vindicated. He responded to Watkins in a BMJ paper of his own, accusing him of being both irresponsible and misinformed. He reiterated his erroneous claim that &quot;both children showed signs of both recent and past abuse&quot; (injuries which the defence claimed were either misidentified in a badly-performed post-mortem, or caused by the mother&#x27;s attempts at resuscitation) and underlined the judges&#x27; controversial ruling that Clark and her husband had given &quot;untrue evidence&quot;.

Meadow&#x27;s vindication was to be short-lived: after the campaigning lawyer Marilyn Stowe obtained new evidence from Macclesfield Hospital, it emerged that another expert witness, Home Office Pathologist Dr Alan Williams, had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in the form of results of medical tests which showed that her second child had died from the bacterial infection &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, and not from smothering as the prosecution had claimed. A second appeal was launched and in allowing Clark&#x27;s appeal to proceed Lord Justice Kay stated in open court that Meadow&#x27;s statistics were &#x27;grossly misleading&#x27; and &#x27;manifestly wrong&#x27;.

Although the central reasons for the Clark appeal&#x27;s success were separate from Meadow&#x27;s evidence, the discredited statistics were revisited in the hearing. In their ruling, in marked contrast to the opinions at the first appeal, the judges stated that:
Sally Clark&#x27;s conviction was overturned in January 2003.

===Death of Sally Clark===
Sally Clark died unintentionally on 16 March 2007 from acute alcohol intoxication.

She never recovered from the severe psychological trauma resulting from the experience of the deaths of two children, then being unjustly convicted of their murder with subsequent imprisonment leading to her being separated from her third baby.

==Trupti Patel==

In June 2003, the CPS used Meadow&#x27;s expert testimony against Trupti Patel, a pharmacist accused of killing three of her babies. After a highly publicised trial lasting several weeks, the jury took less than 90 minutes to return a unanimous verdict of &quot;not guilty&quot;. Even then, a spokesperson for the prosecution stated that the crown would still be &quot;very happy&quot; to use Meadow&#x27;s evidence in future trials. However, the Solicitor General for England and Wales, Harriet Harman (whose sister is Sarah Harman, a lawyer involved in another subsequent high-profile case where the parents had been accused of harming their children) effectively barred Meadow from court work; she warned prosecution lawyers that the defence should be informed of court criticisms of Meadow&#x27;s evidence.

==Angela Cannings==

The following December Angela Cannings, a mother convicted on Meadow&#x27;s evidence, was freed on appeal. She had been wrongly convicted of murdering two of her three babies, both of whom had died in their first few weeks of life. Following the quashing of her convictions, Meadow found himself under investigation by the British General Medical Council for alleged professional misconduct.

Cannings&#x27; case differed from Clark&#x27;s in that there was no physical evidence. The prosecution rested upon what was perceived to be &quot;suspicious behaviour&quot; on the part of the mother (telephoning her husband instead of emergency services when one of the deaths occurred) and upon Meadow&#x27;s opinion that she was an MSbP sufferer. He had told the jury that the boys &quot;could not&quot; have been genuine cot death victims because they were fit and healthy right up until the time of death (contradicting other experts who claim this is typical of SIDS cases). The prosecution had also rejected any genetic explanation, stating that there was no family history of cot death. Although no enumerated statistics had been presented, Meadow had told the jury that double cot death was extremely unlikely. The jurors took nine hours to return a guilty verdict.

Cannings had already lost one appeal but, in the wake of the Clark and Patel acquittals, the case was &quot;fast tracked&quot; for a second appeal. In the weeks that followed, an investigation by the BBC showed that the prosecution&#x27;s &quot;no family history&quot; argument had been incorrect: at least two of Cannings&#x27; paternal ancestors had lost an abnormally large number of infants to unexplained causes, making a genetic predisposition to cot death highly plausible.

The appeal was heard in December 2003 and the Court of Appeal declared the original conviction unsafe and allowed Cannings&#x27; appeal.

==Aftermath==

In January 2004, the Deputy Chief Justice, Lord Justice Judge, gave the full reasons for allowing Cannings&#x27; appeal. His comments included criticism of Meadow&#x27;s evidence, of his standing as an expert witness and of &#x27;experts&#x27; adopting an over-dogmatic stance :

Only a relatively small number of appeals were actually launched, though most of these were successful (including that of Donna Anthony, who served six years after being wrongly convicted of killing her son and daughter). In addition to this, the law was changed such that no person can be convicted on the basis of expert testimony alone.

On 21 June 2005, Meadow appeared before a GMC fitness to practise tribunal. On the first day of Meadow&#x27;s defence, Dr Richard Horton, Editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, published an article in defence of Meadow. This controversial interference in the GMC process &#x27;incensed&#x27; Sally Clark. Her husband, Stephen, later wrote to the Lancet to highlight Horton&#x27;s &quot;many inaccuracies and one-sided opinions&quot; in order to prevent them prejudicing independent observers.

On 13 July, the tribunal ruled that his evidence in the Clark case was indeed misleading and incorrect and on 15 July decided he was guilty of &quot;serious professional misconduct&quot;.

It was during the hearing that, when questioned directly on the matter, Meadow made his first public apology for the effect of his &#x27;misleading&#x27; evidence. He cited the reasons for the delay as being &#x27;legal advice&#x27; and &#x27;professional etiquette&#x27;. The failure to apologise, and not admitting that he was wrong, was the reason why Sally Clark&#x27;s father, Frank Lockyer, had raised his concerns about Meadow with the GMC.

His failure to apologise spontaneously was not his first departure from good ethical conduct in this case; during a break at Clark&#x27;s committal hearing at Macclesfield Magistrates&#x27; Court Meadow had approached the defence team and addressed Sally Clark saying, &#x27;this is terrible for me, it must be awful for you.&#x27; He was instructed by Clark&#x27;s barrister Michael Mackey to &#x27;go away&#x27;.

The decision was made that his name should be struck from the medical register. The Society of Expert Witnesses commented that the severity of this punishment would cause many professionals to reconsider whether to stand as expert witnesses.

The following month, Meadow launched an appeal against this ruling. On 17 February 2006, High Court judge Mr Justice Collins found in his favour, ruling against the decision to strike him from the medical register. The judge stated that although the GMC had been right to criticize him, his actions could not properly be regarded as &quot;serious professional misconduct&quot;.

On 26 October 2006, the Appeal Court overturned the High Court&#x27;s earlier ruling, allowing expert witnesses to be disciplined once again but ruled that the High Court decision that Meadow was not guilty of serious professional misconduct should stand. However, on the issue of serious professional misconduct, the Appeal Court panel was split 2:1 with the dissenting senior judge, Sir Anthony Clarke, concluding Meadow was &quot;guilty of serious professional misconduct&quot; and provided detailed reasons for his conclusion. One of the other two judges, Lord Justice Auld, said Meadow &quot;was undoubtedly guilty of some professional misconduct&quot; but that it &quot;fell far short of serious professional misconduct&quot; (see Richard Webster&#x27;s article discussing the judgment.)

In 2004, Meadow&#x27;s ex-wife, Gillian Paterson, accused Meadow of seeing &quot;mothers with Munchausen&#x27;s Syndrome by Proxy wherever he looked,&quot; and implied that he was a misogynist: &quot;I don&#x27;t think he likes women... although I can&#x27;t go into details, I&#x27;m sure he has a serious problem with women&quot;.

In 2009, Meadow relinquished his registration with the GMC and thus became unlicensed to practice medicine. In addition this voluntary erasure from the list of registered medical practitioners meant that he would no longer be answerable to the GMC should any further concerns be raised regarding any previous professional activity.

==Ian and Angela Gay==
In the 2005 trial of Ian and Angela Gay over the death of their adopted son Christian, the prosecution relied heavily upon Meadow&#x27;s 1993 paper &quot;Non-accidental salt poisoning&quot;, citing it many times throughout the trial. The judge also referred to the paper citing it five times during his summing up. Ian and Angela Gay were found guilty of manslaughter and spent 15 months in prison before their convictions were quashed.

In interviews for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;File on 4&quot; programme, Professor Jean Golding and Professor Ashley Grossman both questioned the reliability of the Meadow paper. The naturally occurring condition diabetes insipidus was suggested as a more likely cause of an elevated salt level than deliberate salt poisoning.

<doc id="452446" wikidata="Q5029865" url="?curid=452446" title="Canadian Citizenship Act, 1946">
<text>The Canadian Citizenship Act () was a statute passed by the Parliament of Canada in 1946 which created the legal status of Canadian citizenship. The Act defined who were Canadian citizens, separate and independent from the status of the British subject and repealed earlier Canadian legislation relating to Canadian nationals and citizens as sub-classes of British subject status.

The Act came into force on 1 January 1947 and was in force for thirty years, until replaced on 15 February 1977 by a new statute, the &quot;Canadian Citizenship Act, 1976&quot;, now known as the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot;.

==Pre-1947: British subjects and Canadian citizens==

The status of &quot;Canadian citizen&quot; was originally created under the &quot;Immigration Act, 1910&quot; to designate those British subjects who were born, naturalized, or domiciled in Canada. All other British subjects required permission to land. &quot;Domicile&quot; was defined as having been resident in Canada for three years, excluding any time spent in prisons or mental institutions.

A separate status of &quot;Canadian national&quot; was created under the &quot;Canadian Nationals Act, 1921&quot;, which was defined as being a Canadian citizen as defined above, their wives, and any children (fathered by such citizens) that had not yet landed in Canada.

However, these concepts were merely subsets of the status of &quot;British subject&quot;, which was regulated by the Imperial British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, which was adopted in Canada by the Naturalization Act, 1914.

==Creation of Canadian Citizenship (January 1947)==

Canadian citizenship, as a status separate from British nationality, was created by the &quot;Canadian Citizenship Act&quot; of 1946, which came into effect on 1 January 1947. (Although passed in 1946, it is often referred to as the &quot;1947 Citizenship Act&quot; because it came into force in 1947.) 

===Immediate effect===
Canadian citizenship was generally conferred immediately on the following persons:

* a person who was born in Canada (or on a Canadian ship) before 1947, and had not become an alien before 1947;
* a person other than a natural-born Canadian citizen:
** who was granted, or whose name was included in, a certificate of naturalization under any act of the Parliament of Canada and had not become an alien at the commencement of the Act, or
** who was a British subject who had acquired Canadian domicile (i.e., five years&#x27; residence in Canada as a landed immigrant) before 1947
* a British subject who lived in Canada for 20 years immediately before 1947 and was not, on 1 January 1947, under order of deportation
* women who were married to a Canadian before 1947 and who entered Canada as a landed immigrant before 1947
* children born outside Canada to a Canadian father (or mother, if born out of wedlock) before 1947

In the latter two cases, a &quot;Canadian&quot; was a British subject who would have been considered a Canadian citizen if the 1947 Act had come into force immediately before the marriage or birth (as the case may be). Where the child born outside Canada was not a minor (i.e., was not under 21 years in age) at the time the Act came into force, proof of landed immigrant status was required to confirm Canadian citizenship.

===Acquisition of citizenship after 1947===

In addition to those people who became Canadian citizens upon the coming into force of the Act, citizenship afterwards was generally acquired as follows:

* birth in Canada (except where either parent is a representative of a foreign government, their employee, or anyone granted diplomatic privileges or immunities &quot;and&quot; neither parent is a citizen or permanent resident)
* naturalization in Canada after five years&#x27; residence as a landed immigrant
* grant of citizenship to a foreign woman married to a Canadian man after one year&#x27;s residence as a landed immigrant
* grant of citizenship to women who lost British subject status prior to 1947 upon marriage to a foreign man or his subsequent naturalization
* registration of a child born outside Canada to a Canadian &quot;responsible parent&quot; (being the father, if the child was born in wedlock, or the mother, if the child was born out of wedlock and was residing with the mother, if the father was deceased or if custody of the child had been awarded to the mother by court order)

===Newfoundland and citizenship===
A notable addition to the 1947 Act occurred when Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949. All native or naturalized Newfoundlanders were granted Canadian citizenship under the laws stated in the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot;, upon the date of union on 1 April 1949.

=== Inuit and First Nations from Alaska ===
In 1956, Parliament amended the &quot;Citizenship Act&quot; to retroactively grant citizenship to a small group of First Nations and Inuit who had entered Canada from Alaska at some point before 1947 but had not made formal application to enter Canada. The amendment provided that anyone who was defined as &quot;Indians&quot; (First Nations) or &quot;Eskimos&quot; (Inuit), and who were not natural-born citizens, but were domiciled in Canada on 1 January 1947, and had been resident in Canada for ten years as at 1 January 1956, were granted citizenship retroactive to January 1, 1947.

==Loss of citizenship==

Loss of Canadian citizenship generally occurred in the following cases:

* naturalization outside Canada
* in the case of a minor, naturalization of a parent
* service in foreign armed forces
* naturalized Canadians who lived outside Canada for 10 years and did not file a declaration of retention
* where a Canadian had acquired that status by descent from a Canadian parent, and who was either not lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence on the commencement of the Act or was born outside Canada afterwards, loss of citizenship could occur on the person&#x27;s 22nd birthday unless the person had filed a declaration of retention between their 21st and 22nd birthday and renounced any previous nationality they possessed.

Although Canada restricted dual citizenship between 1947 and 1977, there were some situations where Canadians could nevertheless legally possess another citizenship. For example, migrants becoming Canadian citizens were not asked to formally prove that they had ceased to hold the nationality of their former country. Similarly children born in Canada to non-Canadian parents were not under any obligation to renounce a foreign citizenship they had acquired by descent. Holding a foreign passport did not &quot;in itself&quot; cause loss of Canadian citizenship.

He worked at Atari, Inc. in the early 1980s, where he designed and programmed the Atari 2600 games &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot;, &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, and &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;.

Warshaw has written four books, and produced and directed three documentaries.

==Early life==
Warshaw was &quot;Colorado-born, Jersey-raised, and New Orleans-schooled.&quot; He attended Tulane University, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree with a double major in Math and Economics. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and received a scholarship for his graduate work in Computer Science. One year later, he received his master&#x27;s degree in Computer Engineering.

==Career==
After graduation, he was hired at Hewlett-Packard as a multi-terminal systems engineer. Feeling unfulfilled, he began looking for another job. In 1981, he was hired at Atari, Inc.

===Atari===
Warshaw&#x27;s first success, &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot;, had been conceived as an Atari 2600 adaptation of the arcade game &quot;Star Castle&quot;. However, as limitations became clear, Warshaw re-adapted the concept into a new game involving mutated houseflies defending their world against an alien attacker. The game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Time Freeze&quot;. Playtesting by Atari found that the game was popular with women. The game was a major success and is still regarded as one of the best games made for the Atari 2600. This led Warshaw to be chosen to design the game adaptation of the film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, which was also a critically acclaimed commercial success.

His success on &quot;Raiders&quot; likewise made him designer and programmer of the ill-fated Atari 2600 adaptation of the film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. Problems began early as he was only given five weeks to go from concept to finished product. Warshaw was assisted by Jerome Domurat, a graphics designer at Atari. Although the game was finished on time, it was poorly received and seen as confusing and frustrating. Atari took a major financial loss on the project which, combined with the company&#x27;s other poor business decisions and the video game crash of 1983, led to the company being divided and sold within two years. During this time, Warshaw developed and almost finished another game called &quot;Saboteur&quot;. He left the company before it was completed. It was then re-adapted into a game based on the television series &quot;The A-Team&quot; but this also remained unfinished. Atari dismantled before either version could be released.

In the 2014 movie &quot;&quot; he is quoted as saying that each of his games had more than 1 million copies sold.

===Later work===
Following the collapse of Atari, Warshaw wrote two books. The first, &quot;The Complete Book of PAN&quot;, is a guide to the card game of PAN. In the second, &quot;Conquering College&quot;, Warshaw discusses his techniques toward academic success, referred to as RASABIC (Read Ahead, Stay Ahead, Be In Class) which enabled him to graduate early and save one full year&#x27;s tuition.

Later, he studied video production and released the documentary &quot;From There to Here: Scenes of Passage&quot;, a chronicle of the American immigration of two Russian women from the same family, one in 1920 and the other in 1980. Subsequently, he went on to produce the multi-part documentary &quot;Once Upon Atari&quot;, a collection of interviews and stories of employees and designers at Atari during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 2005, he also produced and directed the documentary &quot;Vice &amp; Consent&quot;, focusing on members of the BDSM scene in San Francisco. This documentary was adopted by Santa Clara University as part of their Human Sexuality program, where Warshaw lectures regularly.

In 2004 classic video game enthusiasts produced cartridges of &quot;Saboteur&quot; for sale at game expos. It debuted at PhillyClassic 5 where Warshaw approved of the distribution and autographed cartridges. That year Atari released the Atari Flashback system that includes fifteen Atari 2600 and five Atari 7800 games, including &quot;Saboteur&quot;.

Warshaw always left his initials as a video game Easter egg. In &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, the player can find a &quot;Yar&quot;. In &quot;E.T.&quot;, the player can find both a &quot;Yar&quot; and an &quot;Indy&quot;. In &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot;, sometimes the enemy will launch itself out of its protective shield at the player; with a well-timed shot, the player can destroy the enemy instead of just avoiding it. When this happens, a black streak will appear in the explosion. If the player stays on this &quot;mean streak&quot; until the explosion is complete, HSWWSH (his initials forward and backward) appear on the screen and end the game.

In 2008, Warshaw guest-starred as himself in the G4TV animated series &quot;Code Monkeys&quot; in the second-season episode &quot;Dean in Charge&quot;.

In 2011, Warshaw received a Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology from John F. Kennedy University. He was an intern psychotherapist in private practice specializing in couples and the unique stresses and challenges of Silicon Valley&#x27;s Hi-tech community.
He has a role in the independent film &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie&quot;. The movie involves the title character digging up the infamous &quot;E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; cartridges in the New Mexican landfill where millions of copies are believed to be buried. His role was originally going to be the main role, playing a &quot;mad scientist&quot; version of himself. Because of his involvement in psychotherapy, Warshaw requested to change his role to a cameo, playing as his actual self.

On November 14, 2012, Warshaw became a licensed psychotherapist in California. He has a private practice in Los Altos as well as doing public speaking and training delivery in the Silicon Valley area.

In June 2013, Warshaw became a contributing artist to the Museum of Modern Art in New York where &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot; was accepted as a part of the new video game collection. As of that time, this game became part of the museum&#x27;s second round of additions, out of the first twenty-one total items, in their video game collection which had begun in late 2012.

In early 2020, Warshaw published &quot;Inspired Therapist: My inner journey from wannabe to healer&quot;, relating &quot;a series of reflections about therapy, what it means to be a therapist, and what it means to live an authentic life&quot;

Also in 2020, Warshaw published a companion volume to his documentary &quot;Once Upon Atari&quot;, a book entitled &quot;Once Upon Atari: How I made history by killing an industry&quot;.

<doc id="452452" wikidata="Q213758" url="?curid=452452" title="Pachacuti">
<text>Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, also called Pachacútec (), was the ninth Sapa Inca of the Chiefdom of Cusco, which he transformed into the Inca Empire (). Most archaeologists now believe that the famous Inca site of Machu Picchu was built as an estate for Pachacuti.

In Quechua, the cosmogonical concept of &quot;pachakutiy&quot; means &quot;the turn of the world&quot; and &quot;yupanki&quot; could mean &quot;honorable lord&quot;. During his reign, Cusco grew from a hamlet into an empire that could compete with, and eventually overtake, the Chimú empire on the northern coast. He began an era of conquest that, within three generations, expanded the Inca dominion from the valley of Cusco to a sizeable part of western South America. According to the Inca chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega, Pachacuti created the Inti Raymi to celebrate the new year in the Andes of the southern hemisphere. Pachacuti is often linked to the origin and expansion of the cult of Inti. 

Following his death, Pachacuti&#x27;s deeds were transmitted through various means, including genealogical histories, life histories, and quipus, kept near his royal mummy.

Accessing power following the Chanka–Inca War, Pachacuti conquered territories around Lake Titicaca and Lake Poopó in the south, parts of the eastern slopes of the Andes Mountains near the Amazon rainforest in the east, lands up to the Quito basin in the north, and lands from Tumbes to possibly the coastal regions from Nasca and Camaná to Tarapacá. These conquests were achieved with the help of many military commanders, and they initiated Inca imperial expansion in the Andes.

Pachacuti is considered by some anthropologists to be one of the first historical emperors of the Incas, and by others to be a mythological and cosmological representation of the beginning of the era of Inca imperial expansion.

== Name ==
The compound &quot;pachacuti&quot; refers to an ancient Andean cosmological concept, representing cataclysmic change of era-worlds. The anthroponym appeared written as ⟨Pachacuti⟩ or ⟨Pachacute⟩ in the early colonial chronicles and documents of the 16th century. This written form can be reconstructed into Quechua as &quot;pacha kutiy&quot; &quot;the turn of the world&quot;. The form ⟨Pachacútec⟩ (in contemporary Quechua spelling: ⟨Pachakutiq⟩) was introduced by the writer Inca Garcilaso de la Vega in his &quot;Comentarios Reales de los Incas&quot; published in 1609. Before the coronation, Pachacuti was referred to as Inga Yupangui, with the Spanish navigator Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa additionally claiming Pachcuti&#x27;s first name was &quot;Cusi&quot;.

The compound is not influenced by other languages such as Aymara or Puquina, and is considered purely Quechua. It is composed of the noun &quot;pacha&quot;, which today means &quot;world, Earth, universe; (a precise moment in time)&quot; and represents an Andean concept associating time with the physical world, and the verb &quot;kuti&quot;- &quot;to return, to come back&quot;. The apparent absence of a nominalization mark is attributed to the Spanish colonial scribes&#x27; failure to recognize the presence of an -&quot;y&quot; action nominalizer. Consequently, &quot;kuti-y&quot; means &quot;turn, return&quot;. The colonial chronicler Juan de Betanzos translated the anthroponym &quot;Pacha Kutiy&quot; as &quot;turn of time&quot; and the Peruvian linguist Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino translated the compound as &quot;the turn of the world&quot;. The form &quot;Pachacútec&quot; used in Garcilaso de la Vega&#x27;s writing likely was caused by the Inca&#x27;s storing of the agent nominalizer -&quot;q&quot; instead of the action nominalizer -&quot;y&quot;. In Quechua, the presence of a uvular consonant such as /q/ causes the vowel /ɪ/ to be pronounced as an [e], thus being transcribed as -&quot;ec&quot; in Spanish. However, Garcilaso&#x27;s restitution contradicted early colonial documentation and was grammatically implausible, since the verb &quot;kuti&quot;- is an intransitive verb, and the chronicler&#x27;s intended meaning for the word of &quot;(he) who turns the world&quot; required an additional morpheme altering the verbal valence. The form ⟨Pachacutec⟩ (*&quot;pacha kuti-q&quot;) reconstructed by Garcilaso was ungrammatical in Quechua, and the meaning of &quot;he who turns the world&quot; would have instead required an expression similar to *&quot;pacha kuti-chi-q&quot;.

According to the oral tradition of Pachacuti&#x27;s imperial lineage, the name was acquired following the war against the Chancas, according to the chronicler Juan de Betanzos&#x27; version together with the names or epithets &quot;Cápac&quot; and &quot;Indichuri&quot;.

== Historicity ==
Pachacuti is often considered the first historical Incan emperor, despite various mythological elements of his reign. Various historians associate Pachacuti with the rewriting of the previous Inca rulers&#x27; reigns, in order to justify Incan imperial expansion. The nature of Pachacuti&#x27;s reign, the cosmological concepts associated with it, the lack of physical representations and of archeological evidence made some scholars come to the conclusion that Pachacuti was an Incan ideological and cosmological concept.

The linguists, anthropologists, archeologists, ethnologists and historians Martti Pärssinen, Catherine Julien, Rodolfo Cerrón Palomino, Alfred Métraux, Brian S. Bauer, John Howland Rowe, Franck Salomon, Waldemar Espinoza Soriano, José Antonio del Busto Duthurburu, Gary Urton, and María Rostworowski, and Carmen Bernand consider Pachacuti to be historical, while others, such as Pierre Duviols, Juan Ossio Acuña, Reiner Tom Zuidema, and Franck Garcia consider Pachacuti to be mythological or mytho-historical. According to the archeologist Franck Garcia, the story of Pachacuti&#x27;s reign was mainly symbolical and served to set philosophical principles, Inca history having the structural elements of a myth. John Howland Rowe analyzed and compared various colonial sources and came to the conclusion that there existed a state-sanctioned &quot;standard history&quot;, believing Pachacuti&#x27;s victory over the Chanka people to be the cause of imperial expansion. In 1953, María Rostworowski published her biography of Pachacuti, and supported Rowe&#x27;s conclusion of late imperial expansion under Pachacuti. The Dutch structuralist anthropologist Reiner Tom Zuidema criticised Rowe and Rostworowski for methodological practices, and studied the symbolical territorial organization of Cusco and its surroundings. Based on the dualist philosophy of the Andes, Reiner Tom Zuidema and Pierre Duviols came to the conclusion that the Inca Empire was a diarchy, and that Pachacuti had co-reigned with the warrior chieftain Mayta Capac (the fourth ruler of Cusco in the traditional list), while Martti Pärssinen, examining Andean tripartite traditions, wrote that the Inca capital, Cusco, had three rulers, the co-rulers of Pachacuti being Capac Yupanqui and Mayta Capac, while the state-wide imperial administration had only one. In 1945, Rowe devised an imperial chronology, stating Pachacuti reigned from 1438 to 1471, however archeological data suggests the early 15th century to be the beginning of Pachacuti&#x27;s reign. The former minister of culture Juan Ossio Acuña supported the position of Zuidema, who wrote that the Inca rulers before Topa Inca Yupanqui, including Pachacuti, weren&#x27;t historical rulers but rather social groups or factions. In 2009, Catherine Julien found that, while Zuidema&#x27;s structuralist anthropology &quot;does serve to reorient our search for a meaningful Inca history&quot;, it &quot; does not take theory of change into account&quot; and describes pre-Hispanic Incas &quot;in the same terms as groups that have survived a long history of colonial domination&quot;.

== Chronology ==
The Incas of Cusco did not systematically count years, and dates of Inca mytho-history are only approximations based on comparisons between colonial documents or archeological data. An exact date for the Chanka–Inca War, which marked the beginning of Pachacuti&#x27;s reign, is not known, since it happened several generations before the arrival of Europeans, maybe in the beginning of the 15th century. However, the dates recorded by colonial chroniclers, though unrealistic, were potentially based on Inca mytho-historical knowledge put on quipu records. 

According to the north-American anthropologist Philip Ainsworth Means, Pachacuti reigned from 1400 to 1448. John Howland Rowe, basing himself on the Spanish chronicler Miguel Cabello de Balboa, theorised a standard chronology, in which Pachacuti reigned from 1438 to 1471, however, radiocarbon dates suggest an earlier date, in the beginning of the 15th century. According to Domingos Jaguaribe, Pachacuti&#x27;s reign lasted from 1410 to 1450. The historian José A. Mendoza del Solar stated in 1920 that Pachacuti&#x27;s reign took place between 1420 and 1472. The Peruvian historian José Antonio del Busto Duthurburu wrote Pachacuti was born in 1403, defended Cusco from the Chankas in 1424, and reigned from 1425 to 1471. Rowe wrote that Tupac Yupanqui took military command in 1463, while Antonio del Busto Duthurburu thought Tupac Yupanqui, born in 1440, led his first military campaign around 1461. According to del Busto, Amaru Inca Yupanqui&#x27;s, one of Pachacuti&#x27;s sons, co-reign happened around 1450. The Peruvian ethno-historian María Rostworowski suggested Pachacuti reigned, from the beginning of the 15th century onward, for around 60 years, 40 years alone, 5 to 6 years with Amaru Yupanqui and 14 to 15 years with Tupac Yupanqui. According to Elías Martinengui Suárez, Amaru Yupanqui&#x27;s co-reign lasted 10 years. The Bolivian historian Mariano Baptista Gumucio and Santos García Ortiz found Amaru Yupanqui to have reigned independently in 1478, following Pachacuti&#x27;s death, before quickly being overthrown.
== Sources ==
Inca history was transmitted through oral traditions, quipu cords, and pictographic representations, and had several versions and historiographical genres, mainly the &quot;life history&quot; and &quot;genealogical&quot; genres. The main sources for Pachacuti&#x27;s reign are the colonial chroniclers Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa and Juan de Betanzos: the latter based his account on the &quot;life history&quot; genre, transmitted within each Inca rulers&#x27; panaka (descent group), and the former, who&#x27;s work was authenticated by Inca descent groups in Cusco, drew from a compilation of different sources, who&#x27;s structure was taken from the life history genre. Life histories were compiled at the Sapa Inca&#x27;s death, and were kept by the ruler&#x27;s panaka on quipus put near Inca royal mummies. Pachacuti&#x27;s life history started with the Chanka attack and ended with the emperor&#x27;s death and the short poem attributed to him.

=== Juan de Betanzos ===
The colonial chronicler Juan de Betanzos based his telling of Pachacuti&#x27;s reign on the Inca &quot;life history&quot; of Pachacuti, along with other minor Incan sources. Betanzos translated his indigenous wife&#x27;s telling of Inca history, and was familiar with Andean notions of memory. Generally considered reliable, the chronicler had, however, manipulated Pachacuti&#x27;s epic to insert Yamqui Yupanqui, his wife&#x27;s ancestor, at the place of Amaru Yupanqui and Tupac Yupanqui. The goal of Betanzos&#x27; wife, Angelina Yupanqui, was to access higher legitimacy within Cusco society, by claiming her ancestor to have been Pachacuti&#x27;s initial choice for succession. While most chroniclers found Pachacuti&#x27;s main wife to have been from the Choco and Cachona ayllus, Betanzos, in order to conform the royal couple to Inca ideals of legitimacy, wrote she was the emperor&#x27;s sister.

=== Sarmiento de Gamboa ===
==Early life and parentage==
Pachacuti&#x27;s given name was Cusi Yupanqui, or Ripac, and he originated from the female lineage of &quot;Iñaca Panaka&quot;, in the moiety of &quot;Hanan Cusco&quot; (&quot;high Cusco&quot;), in complementary opposition to the moiety of &quot;Hurin Cusco&quot; (&quot;low Cusco&quot;). According to the accounts of the Spanish chroniclers, he was the son of the eighth ruler of Cusco, Inca Viracocha, whose lineage (panaka), however, was &quot;Sucsu Panaka&quot;. Analyzing the colonial writings, the historian and anthropologist María Rostworowski concluded that, based on Andean traditions of succession, which allowed for the &quot;most able&quot; to take power, Pachacuti was not the son of Inca Viracocha, rendering him illegitimate in the eyes of the Spaniards, who believed in European concepts of primogeniture. According to Catherine Julien, rather than being based on direct descent from the last ruler, Inca legitimacy was, based on a concentration of &quot;capac&quot; status, a status given to direct descendants of Manco Capac and his sister wife, linked to the Sun deity, inherited through the female and male line.

Cusi Yupanqui was born in Cusco, at the palace of Cusicancha, bordering the Inticancha temple. His tutor, Micuymana, taught him history, laws and language, as well as the handling of quipus. From a young age, he was admired by Inca nobles because he had the courage, intelligence and maturity his brother, Inca Urco, the appointed co-ruler and heir to the throne, lacked. Similarly, he showed aptitudes for government and conquest that his brother likewise lacked. The generals of Viracocha started fomenting conspiracies to overthrow and replace Inca Urco.

== Rise to power ==
In the early 15th century, the Cusco confederation, stretching 40 kilometers around the city of Cusco, faced an invasion by the Chankas, the Incas&#x27; traditional tribal archenemies. Multiple versions of the encounter exist, the most accepted one being supported by the majority of reliable Spanish sources.

The ruler, Inca Viracocha, and his co-ruler Urco, fled the scene, while Cusi Yupanqui rallied the army, accompanied by four of Viracocha&#x27;s generals, and prepared the defense of the city. During the subsequent assault on Cusco, the Chankas were repelled, so severely that legend tells even the stones rose up to fight on Yupanqui&#x27;s side. At the battle of Yahuar Pampa, the Inka army won a decisive victory over the Chankas and asserted its dominance. Cusi Yupanqui captured many Chanka leaders, who he presented to his father Viracocha for him to wipe his feet on their bodies, a traditional victory ritual. Viracocha told Yupanqui that the honor of the ritual belonged to the designated heir, Urco. Yupanqui protested and said that he had not won the victory for his brothers to step on the Chanka captives. A heated argument ensued, and Viracocha tried to have the general assassinated. Yupanqui was tipped off to the plot, however, and the assassination failed. Viracocha went into exile while Inca Yupanqui returned in triumph to Cusco, and, following a short civil war during which the co-ruler, Urco, died, was crowned Sapa Inca of Cusco, and renamed himself &quot;Pachacuti&quot; (meaning &quot;Earth Shaker&quot;). 

The ethnic groups surrounding Cusco that helped Pachacuti defeat the Chanka received the status of &quot;hawa inka&quot;, &quot;Incas from outside&quot;, also translated as &quot;Incas by privilege&quot;, and were later often in charge of supervising the construction of bridges or storehouses.

=== Historical accuracy ===
The existence and the historical accuracy of the chanka attack on Cusco have been questioned regularly, notably because of its similarities with other mythical cyclical events. Archeological evidence is contradictory: the chanka chiefdom was either a powerful polity equal to the Incas, or a loose alliance of independent chiefdoms based on mutual defence. Since the early 1980s, the academic consensus, following the thesis of Pierre Duviols, has been to consider the event as largely mythical. For María Rostworowski, González Carré, Luis Millones and Brian Bauer, the conflict with the chankas was a &quot;legendary saga&quot; and part of the ancient Wari tradition. For Reiner Tom Zuidema and Clementina Battcock, the epic was linked to a conflict between the religious elite and the class of warrior chieftains. For Terence N. D&#x27;Altroy, while potentially containing historical elements, the saga of the chanka-inca war &quot;may still be mostly a glorious epic invoked to burnish the image of the emperor&#x27;s father&quot;, Viracocha Inca. Franck Meddens and Cirilo Vivanco Pomacanchari find the Chanka attack to be either the Inca&#x27;s justification for conquests northwest of Cusco, or the Chanka response to previous Inca aggression by Pachacuti.

== Reign ==
As ruler, Pachacuti married Mama Anawarkhi&quot;,&quot; of the ayllus of Choqo and Cachona, most likely to reward a chief belonging to one of these ayllus who had defended Cusco during the Chanka invasion, and left his original family-clan (panaka) to form the imperial lineage of Hatun Ayllu, failing in his attempt to fuse the two factions. To record the history of the previous Inca rulers of Cusco, Pachacuti ordered the creation of painted wooden panels, which, in relation to oral texts, often in the form of mnemonic songs sung at important celebrations, and quipus, which contained simple and stereotyped information according to colour, order and number, decipherable by Quipucamayocs, represented official and state-sanctioned pre-imperial history. In order to &quot;incanize&quot; provincial elites culturally and linguistically, Pachacuti gave women from Cusco to the surrounding local chiefs to be their main wives, who&#x27;s children would rule over their chiefdoms.

Despite Pachacuti&#x27;s prestige following the victory over the Chankas, he had &quot;little effective power and a meager work force to undertake the development of Cusco&quot;. Instituting the system of reciprocity (a socio-economic principle regulating relations, based on obligatory and institutional mutual, &quot;give and take&quot;, assistance) to assert his authority, Pachacuti summoned the surrounding kurakas (chiefs) to Cusco, and prepared &quot;lavish feasts and ceremonies&quot;, tactically displaying much generosity and sharing gifts, including the booty of the war against the Chankas, before articulating gradually growing demands such as the construction of warehouses, the stocking of produce, the creation of an army, and the improvement of infrastructure. Using the means of reciprocity, Pachacuti rebuilt much of Cusco, designing it to serve the needs of an imperial city and as a representation of the empire. Each &quot;suyu&quot; had a sector of the city, centering on the road leading to that province; nobles and immigrants lived in the sector corresponding to their origin. Each sector was further divided into areas for the &quot;hanan&quot; (upper) and &quot;hurin&quot; (lower) moieties. Many of the most renowned monuments around Cusco, such as the great sun temple &quot;Qurikancha&quot; (previously &quot;Intikancha&quot;), were rebuilt during Pachacuti&#x27;s reign.

At the beginning of Pachacuti&#x27;s reign, the cult of the Andean creator deity Viracocha, whose priests had supported the previous ruler Viracocha Inca, was possibly replaced by the Inti Sun cult. Some sources however, mentioning a vision of the Viracocha deity Pachacuti could have had on the eve of the chanca attack, believe him to have removed the Inti Sun cult and instituted Viracocha as principal deity. The first months of his reign were spent putting down revolts by surrounding chiefs in the Cusco valley and consolidating the territorial base of the polity, confronting the Ayarmacas, the Ollantaytambo, the Huacara, and the Toguaro. Pachacuti conquered lands along the Urubamba valley, where he founded the famous site of Machu Picchu.

=== Expansion of the realm ===

Local kurakas (lords) were integrated using the principle of reciprocity and the &quot;attachment system&quot;, where the Inca emperor held personal relations with allied local chiefs and &quot;gifts&quot;, in the form of feasts, women, or materials, were exchanged in return for submission, reduced sovereignty, alliance and the construction of hatuncancha (administrative centers). Pachacuti occasionally elevated individuals from the class of yanakunas, servants who weren&#x27;t obligated or entitled to the obligations and rights of reciprocal exchange, to rulers of local chiefdoms who had rebelled or refused Inca domination.

His first military campaign, led personally by the emperor and his general Apo Mayta, was set against the Chankas&#x27; former allies, and the chiefdoms surrounding Cusco. Pachacuti conquered the Soras and Rucanas, the Vilcas, the Lucanas, the Chalcas, and the Cotabambas. The conquest of the chiefdom of Chincha, and the neighboring valley of Pisco, on the south-central coast, also took place during the reign of Pachacuti. The general Capac Yupanqui led an army to Chincha, gaining the recognition and submission of the local chiefs with the help of &quot;reciprocal gifts&quot;, in exchange for which the Chincha allowed the construction of administrative centers, the usage of land cultivated by Aclla (women working for the state) and yanakuna servants, and recognized Pachacuti&#x27;s superiority. However, in 1945, the historian John Howland Rowe attributed the conquest to later rulers, claiming that the initial campaign was a raid.

Pachacuti started the practice of forced migrations, sending mitimaes (colonists) of loyal areas to unstable provinces, or alternatively placing loyal peoples to strategic positions in the Empire. As part of his vision of a statesman and warrior chieftain he conquered many ethnic groups and states, highlighting his conquest of the Collao that enhanced the prestige of the Inca Pachacuti. Due to the remarkable expansion of their domains he was considered an exceptional leader, enlivening glorious epic stories and hymns in tribute to his achievements. Numerous &quot;kurakas&quot; do not hesitate to recognise his skills and identify him as the &quot;Son of the Sun&quot;.

=== Conquest of Qullasuyu ===

The Colla chiefdom and the Lupaca chiefdom of lake Titicaca, in the Altiplano, were one of the first of Pachacuti&#x27;s targets. Following the construction of the Qurikancha, the &quot;temple of gold&quot; dedicated to the sun, Pachacuti sent an army near the border with the Colla chiefdom, before joining his forces not long after. The Colla chief or Colla Capac, informed of this, gathered his forces and awaited the Inca at the town of Ayaviri. During the ensuing battle, the Incas forced the Colla army to retreat, capturing the king, Colla Capac. Following the victory, Pachacuti occupied the principal city, Hatunqulla, and from there he received the submission of the Lupacas, the Pacasas and the Azangaros (previously a tributary chiefdom of the Collas). John Howland Rowe estimated the Inca Empire under Pachacuti to have reached the Desaguadero River near lake Titicaca, which marked the border between the conquered Lupaca chiefdom and the Pacasa chiefdom. However, in 1992, the Finnish ethno-historian Martti Pärssinen, pointing to local colonial sources, wrote that Pachacuti&#x27;s generals reached the nation of Charcas, near lake Poopó. Various Spanish chroniclers place the birth of Topa Inca Yupanqui, son of the queen Mama Anarwakhi, during these conquests.

Pachacuti potentially also conquered parts of Kuntisuyu, where many Aymara enclaves of the highland kingdoms existed, including the regions of Arequipa, Camana and Tarapacá. The conquest of Kuntisuyu is also attributed to Amaru Topa Inca, during the subsequent revolt of the chiefdoms around lake Titicaca.

==== Revolt ====
During military expeditions in the eastern lowlands and the Amazonian rainforest, the Colla, Lupaca and Azangaro revolted, led by one of the sons of the previous Colla ruler. According to Sarmiento de Gamboa, an army of around 200.000 men was assembled, commanded by Amaru Topa Inca, Tupac Ayar Manco and Apu Paucar Usnu, to put it down. After having put down the revolt, the Inca army continued beyond Inca territory and conquered the nations of Sora, Caranga, Caracaras Quillaqua, Charca, Chui and Chicha, near and around lake Poopó, possibly united in an inter-provincial wider confederation of large polities or &quot;Hatun apocazgo&quot;.

=== Expeditions to Chinchaysuyu ===

Pachacuti personally conquered the nations surrounding the kingdom of Cusco, and left the military command of subsequent campaigns to his generals, retiring to concentrate on administrative reforms and the embellishment of Cusco.

The military commander Capac Yupanqui was sent, together with the captains Huayna Yupanqui and Yamqui Yupanqui, to the northern regions of Chinchaysuyu, accompanied by the Chanka army led by the military chief or &quot;sinchi&quot; Anco Huallu. The Inca armies occupied the fortress of Urcocollac, advanced through territories of the central Andes, including those of the Huanca, the Yauyos and the Atavillos. At Huaylas, Capac Yupanqui established the military center of Maraycalle, from where the Inca forces conquered the confederated chiefdoms of Huaylas, Piscopampas, Pincos, Huaris and Conchucos. The Inca armies eventually arrived at the Cajamarca chiefdom, whose capital and main sub-chiefdom was Guzmango, in the &quot;Hanansaya&quot; moiety. Capac Yupanqui, by invading the Cajamarca chiefdom, began tensions with the coastal ally of Cajamarca, the Chimú Empire, which spread from Tumbes in the north to Carabayllo in the south. According to John H. Rowe, the territories annexed by the Empire reached until Chinchaycocha, near the centre of , the rest of the campaign merely raiding the territories up to the Cajamarca chiefdom. The French historian Henri Favre stated that an Inca garrison was established in Cajamarca, leaving a gap between the rest of Inca territory and Cajamarca.

Pachacuti gave military command to his son and heir Topa Inca Yupanqui, who led military campaigns in the northern parts of the Inca Empire, and consolidated Capac Yupanqui conquests. Establishing Cajamarca as a military base, he led an expedition against the Chimú Empire, from the mountains neighbouring the costal lowlands (yungas), forcing the Chimú ruler, Minchançaman, to surrender by cutting the irrigation canals of the Moche River leading to the Chimú capital of Chan Chan. Other campaigns were led against the Chachapoya, the Quitu, the Cañari, and regional chiefdoms of modern-day Ecuador. Martti Pärssinen wrote that the territories north of Tomebamba and Cañar were potentially conquered after Pachacuti&#x27;s reign, who abdicated in favor of his successor according to the chronicler Martín de Murúa.

Following these campaigns, Topa Inca&#x27;s conquests were celebrated on his return to Cusco.

=== Amaru Yupanqui ===
In accordance with Inca successoral customs, Pachacuti named his crown prince, Amaru Yupanqui, his co-ruler, in order to prove the latter&#x27;s military, administrative and intellectual capacities, as well as to avoid wars of succession following his death. Under Amaru&#x27;s co-reign, the Collas revolted while Pachacuti led an expedition in the Amazon rainforest, which was put down and potentially led the Inca armies to conquer lands in Kuntisuyu. According to the traditions collected by colonial chroniclers, Amaru was a &quot;gentle individual&quot; concentrated on &quot;agriculture and the construction of hydraulic canals&quot;. Lacking the military capacities necessary to become Sapa Inca, after 5 to 6 or 10 years of co-reign, Pachacuti revisited his decision and instead presented his son Tupac Yupanqui before the Inca nobles who proceeded to elect Tupac co-ruler. Other sources indicated Amaru&#x27;s reign ended immediately after his mother&#x27;s death, because of the disdain the Inca nobility of Cusco had for him. Amaru continued to have an important place in the government following his co-rule; he profited from a private estate and was in charge of the huacas (sacred sanctuaries) of the Qullasuyu region. He was described as a philosopher, and as &quot;too human to be ruler&quot;. Some historians, however, find Amaru Yupanqui&#x27;s reign to have occurred following the end of Pachacuti&#x27;s. In this interpretation, Amaru was quickly overthrown by Tupac Yupanqui.

=== Reforms ===
In Andean cosmology and mythology, Pachacuti is an important figure along with the creator deity Viracocha and the mythical first Inca Manco Cápac. Pachacuti&#x27;s role was that of an archetype of the perfect Inca ruler according to the philosophical principles of the Inca ruling caste, and of spreading the Inca cultural model and pantheon to the various ethnic groups of the Andes.

Pachacuti built irrigation networks, cultivated terraces, roads and hospices. The &quot;Road of the Inca&quot; (Qhapaq Ñan) stretched from Quito to Chile. Pachacuti is also credited with having displaced hundreds of thousands in massive programs of relocation and resettling them to colonize the most remote edges of his empire. These forced colonists, called &quot;mitimaes&quot;, represented the lowest place in the Incan social hierarchy.

== Death and succession ==
Despite his political and military talents, Pachacuti did not improve the system of succession. His son became the next Inca without any recorded dispute after Pachacuti died in 1471 due to a terminal illness, even though some colonial sources hint at Pachacuti&#x27;s abdication prior to his death. But in future generations, the next Inca had to gain control of the empire by winning enough support from the &quot;apos&quot;, priesthood, and military to win a civil war or intimidate anyone else from trying to wrest control of the empire.
Pachacuti was a poet and the author of the Sacred Hymns of the &quot;Situa&quot; city purification ceremony. Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa attributed one song to Pachacuti on his deathbed: &quot;I was born as a lily in the garden, and like the lily I grew, as my age advanced / I became old and had to die, and so I withered and died.&quot;

Pachacuti initially nominated his son Amaru Topa Inca to be co-ruler and heir to the throne. However, due to the lack of military talent found in the joint prince, Pachacuti changed his decision and instead decided to name another of his sons, Tupac Inca Yupanqui, who in turn had a reputation as a talented general, as his co-ruler and successor. In his last years, the Inca government might have been de facto in the hands of his &quot;helper&quot; (quechua: &quot;yanapac&quot;), &quot;compagnon&quot; (quechua: &quot;yananti&quot;), or &quot;brother&quot; (quechua: &quot;huauque&quot;) in the semi-diarchy of the Inca, by the name of Yamqui Yupanqui. At the death of Pachacuti, instead of confirming his own power, Yamqui Yupanqui rather confirmed Tupac Inca Yupanqui as successor to his father. Some historians, however, doubt the internal organization of Cusco, separated into &quot;Hanan Cusco&quot; and &quot;Hurin Cusco&quot; moities, each of which potentially had two rulers, was identical to the state-wide organization of the Empire into &quot;Hanan saya&quot; (&quot;high half&quot;) and &quot;Hurin saya&quot; (&quot;low half&quot;), of which they doubt it had more than one king.

Pachacuti&#x27;s mummy was transported on his own wishes to the palace of Patallacta, but was later found at Tococache.

== Lineage ==
Pachacuti, considered the son of Inca Viracocha and Mama Runtu, was, according to most traditional lists of Inca rulers, the fourth ruler of a lineage from the &quot;Hanan&quot; moiety of Cusco, whose rulers are collectively called the &quot;Hanan&quot; dynasty. He had several sons, among which are Tupac Ayar Manco, Apu Paucar, Amaru Topa or Amaru Yupanqui, Yamqui Yupanqui, Auqui Yupanqui, Tilca Yupanqui, and Tupac Inca Yupanqui.

Pachacuti had two of his brothers, Capac Yupanqui and Huayna Yupanqui, killed after the military campaign against the region of Chinchay-Suyu. He also killed his sons Tilca Yupanqui and Auqui Yupanqui. Some ethno-historians however think that Capac Yupanqui was the co-ruler or &quot;Huauque&quot; (lit. &quot;brother&quot;) of Pachacuti.

Amaru Topa was originally chosen to be the co-regent and eventual successor. Pachacuti later chose Tupac Inca because Amaru was not competent in military affairs. He was the first Inca ruler to abdicate.

His lineage or panaqa of birth was Iñaka Panka, whose common ancestor was Mama Wako, the wife of Manco Capac, which he left to found his own lineage called Hatun Ayllu. He married Mama Anawarkhi or Anarwakhi &quot;(Coya Anahuarque),&quot; of the ayllus of Choqo and Cachona, most likely to reward a chief belonging to one of these ayllus who had defended Cusco during the Chanka invasion.

== Legacy ==
=== In popular culture ===
* Pachacuti is featured as the leader of the Inca in the video games &quot;Civilization III&quot;, &quot;Civilization V&quot;, &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, and &quot;Civilization VII&quot;.
* Pachacuti, a resurrected Sapa Inca king who is over 500 years old, plays a major role in James Rollins&#x27; novel &quot; Excavation&quot;, whose major action occurs in the Peruvian Andes. The book is steeped in history and culture about the Inca, Moche, and Quechan peoples, their interactions with the Dominican Order and Spanish Conquistadors, and the Spanish Inquisition.
* He was portrayed in the American documentary series &quot;&quot;.
* The BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; featured Pachacuti, played by Mathew Baynton, in the song &quot;Do the Pachacuti&quot; (a parody of novelty party songs) during its second series.
* Pachakutiq is the name of a character played by Clark Gregg in season six of the Marvel TV series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; — not the Incan emperor, but a character who might be said to be a &quot;he who overturns space and time&quot; in a certain sense.
* The video game &quot;Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition&quot; contains a five-chapter campaign titled &quot;Pachacuti&quot;.

<text>Akure is a city in south-western Nigeria. It is the capital and largest city of Ondo State. The city had a population of 403,000 as of the 2006 population census. Its current population is estimated at 774,000.

== History ==
=== Pre-1914 ===
Rock engravings prior to the Mesolithic period, have been discovered on the outskirts of Akure. Also the oldest &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; fossil ever found in West Africa thus far was discovered there, dating back to around 11,000 years ago. The Akure Kingdom is regarded as one of the sixteen ancient Ekiti kingdoms.

According to oral history, a person by the name of Alakure founded Akure, but Omoremilekun Asodeboyede (a descendant of Oduduwa) actually established the present dynasty of monarchs and the modern Akure Kingdom. The Prince left Ile-Ife, where Oduduwa ruled, in search of a place to settle after passing a strict test administered by Oduduwa himself, and eventually founded the city upon his arrival in the Akure region and his conquering of the Alakure. Asodeboyede represents the wave of princely descendants from Ile-Ife who ousted the indigenous rulers of the region. 
The Oba&#x27;s Palace is located at the centre of the town, and was built in 1150 AD.
It has over 16 courtyards (ùà), each having its unique purpose. Ùà Lílá (big courtyard, which serves as the town hall), Ùà Ùbúra (courtyard for swearing oaths), Ùà Jẹ́mifọhùn, Ùà Ùkómọ (courtyard for naming ceremonies), Ùà Ògògà (courtyard of the Ògògà), Ùà Oriole (courtyard for sacred religious oaths taken by chiefs and the king), Ùà Ojukoto (where religious ceremonies are held), Ùà Agbeto (courtyard where babalawo and priests of Ifa meet to offer prayers and council), Ùà Ameshe (where criminals were punished), are some of the names of the courtyards. At present, a bigger and more modern palace is being built to the south of the old palace&#x27;s grounds. Oja Oba, which means the Oba&#x27;s Market, is just a stone&#x27;s throw away from the Palace.

Akure&#x27;s King is known as the Deji of Akure and is supported by six (6) high chiefs (Iwarefa) in his or her domain. The totem of Akure is the Leopard. Omoremilekun (Asodeboyede), the first king of Akure, was himself called Ekun, meaning &quot;Leopard&quot; (this was his regnal name). It is for this reason that every descendant of the Akure clan has been addressed by outsiders as Omo Ekun during the recitation of his or her praise poetry or, alternatively, as &#x27;Omo Akure Oloyemekun&#x27;, since Omoremilekun was said to have stayed for a while at Igbo Ooye ascending to the region that would become his kingdom.

=== 1914–present ===
In 1915, the colonial government merged the divisions of Owo, Ondo and Ekiti to form a new province with headquarters in Akure. In 1976, the town became the capital of Ondo State.

Adebiyi Adegboye Adesida Afunbiowo II was chosen as the Deji of Akure on the 13th August 2010 to succeed the previous Oba Oluwadamilare Adeshina, who had been dethroned on the 10th of June 2010 for gross misconduct. Afunbiowo&#x27;s daughter, the Omoba Adetutu, was appointed princess regent following his demise on the 30th of November, 2013.

In 2015, Omoba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi successfully emerged the new monarch of Akure after beating twelve other contestants nominated by the Osupa ruling house to become the 47th Deji of Akure and was appointed as chairman of the Ondo State Council of Obas by the incumbent Governor of Ondo State; Governor Akeredolu.

There are two other communities with their separate kings, cultures and traditions beside the Akure kingdom. The more prominent of the pair is Isinkan, while the second of them is Isolo. The ruler of Isinkan is known as the Iralepo while that of Isolo is known as the Osolo of Isolo. In the olden days, the three communities (Akure, Isinkan and Isolo) were located some distances apart. The war with the Benin empire in the pre-colonial period necessitated that the three communities move closer together however, and they have occupied their current positions ever since. Other nearby towns include Isarun, Ilara, Igbaraoke, Iju, Itaogbolu, Idanre, Owo, Ikere and Ondo.

The most influential Deji in recent history was Oba Adesida I who was known as Afunbiowo. Several Dejis after him were his direct descendants. Akure is also the birthplace of notable Nigerians like Chief Olu Falae (a one time presidential candidate of a political party who reigns as a titled aristocrat of the realm), legal luminary Dr Akinola Aguda and several personalities in the academia, industry, the military, judiciary and the civil service. Philip Emeagwali, the Gordon Bell Prize winner, and the mother of King Sunny Adé are both citizens of Akure. Akure is also the hometown of Ralph Alabi, a former chairman of Guinness Nigeria, and Kole Omotosho.

<text>Carpatho-Ukraine or Carpathian Ukraine (, ) was an autonomous region, within the Second Czechoslovak Republic, created in December 1938 and renamed as the Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, whose full administrative and political autonomy had been confirmed by constitutional law of 22 November 1938. 

By the 1920 Treaty of Trianon, the region, which had historically belonged to Principality of Hungary, had been detached from the Kingdom of Hungary and attached to the newly created Czechoslovakia. Subsequently Hungary (1920–1946) had sought revision of the Treaty of Trianon and the restoration of her historical borders. 

On 2 November 1938 the First Vienna Award separated territories from the Second Czechoslovak Republic, including southern Carpathian Rus&#x27;, that were mostly Hungarian-populated and returned them to Hungary. After the breakup of the Second Czechoslovak Republic in 1939, Carpatho-Ukraine on 15 March 1939 proclaimed itself an independent republic, headed by President Avgustyn Voloshyn, who appealed to Hitler for recognition and support. Nazi Germany did not reply, and the short-lived state was invaded by the Kingdom of Hungary, crushing all local resistance by 18 March 1939. 

The region remained under Hungarian control until the end of World War II in Europe, after which it was occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union. The territory is now administered as the Ukrainian Zakarpattia Oblast.

== History ==
=== Political autonomy ===

Soon after the implementation of the Munich Agreement, signed on 30 September 1938, by which Czechoslovakia lost much of its border region to Nazi Germany, a series of political reforms were initiated, leading to the creation of a Second Czechoslovak Republic, comprising three autonomous political entities, including an autonomous Slovakia and an autonomous Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; (in the Rusyn language, &quot;Підкарпатьска Русь&quot;). 

The first local government of autonomous Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, appointed on 11 October 1938, was headed by Prime Minister Andrej Bródy. There ensued a crisis involving two factions, pro-Rusyn and pro-Ukrainian, leading to the resignation of Bródy&#x27;s government on 26 October. The new regional government, headed by Avgustyn Voloshyn, adopted a pro-Ukrainian orientation and changed the region&#x27;s name from &quot;Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;&quot; to &quot;Carpathian Ukraine&quot;.

On 22 November 1938 the Second Czechoslovak Republic adopted a &quot;Constitutional Law on the Autonomy of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;&quot; (in the Czech language, &quot;Ústavní zákon o autonomii Podkarpatské Rusi&quot;), officially reaffirming the self-determination rights of the &quot;Rusyn people&quot; (preamble) and confirming the full administrative and political autonomy of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, with its own assembly and government. This was seen as showing the central government&#x27;s support for the pro-Rusyn faction. 

On 30 December 1938 the regional government issued a provisional decree changing the region&#x27;s name to &quot;Carpathian Ukraine&quot;. That led to a peculiar terminological duality: in the Second Czechoslovak Republic&#x27;s constitutional system, the region continued to be known as Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, whereas the region itself used the name &quot;Carpathian Ukraine&quot;.

=== Political crisis ===

In late September 1938, Hungary was ready to mobilize between 200,000 and 350,000 men on the Czechoslovak borders in case the Czechoslovak question could not be solved on diplomatic level, in favor of the Hungarian territorial claims. After the Munich Agreement the Hungarian Army had remained poised threateningly on the Czechoslovak border. They reportedly had artillery ammunition for only 36 hours of operations, and were clearly engaged in a bluff, but it was a bluff the Germans had encouraged, and one that they would have been obliged to support militarily if the much larger, better trained and better equipped Czechoslovak Army chose to fight. The Czechoslovak army had built 2,000 small concrete emplacements along the border in places where rivers did not serve as natural obstacles.

The Hungarian minister of the interior, Miklós Kozma, had been born in Subcarpathia, and in mid-1938 his ministry armed the &quot;Rongyos Gárda&quot; (&#x27;Ragged Guard&#x27;), which began to infiltrate guerillas along the southern borders of Czechoslovakia; into Slovakia and Subcarpathia. The situation was now verging on open war, which might set the whole of Europe ablaze again. The appendix of the Munich Agreement concluded Czechoslovakia and Hungary should arrange their disputes by mutual negotiations, which could not achieve a final agreement, so the Hungarian and the Czechoslovak governments accepted the German-Italian Arbitration of Vienna as France and the United Kingdom rejected participation of no interest. This led to the First Vienna Award.

The agreed border line returned 11,927 square km to Hungary. A census in mid-December found 1,041,401 inhabitants in the reannexed territory, of whom 879,007 (84.4%) were Hungarians and 123,864 (11.9%) were Slovaks.

On 8 November 1938, the Slovak National Unity Party received 97.5 percent of the Slovak votes, and a one-party state was instituted. Slovak autonomy was formalized by the Prague parliament on 19 November, and to symbolize this new Slovak assertiveness, the country&#x27;s name was then altered to Czecho-Slovakia. Carpatho-Ukraine was also given autonomy.

The Arbitration of Vienna fully satisfied nobody, and there followed 22 border clashes between and , during which five Czechoslovaks were killed and six were wounded. The Slovak national militia Hlinka Guard participated in these clashes. The ineffectiveness of the Prague government in protecting their interests stirred Slovak and Ukrainian nationalism further. On 6 January 1939 Czechoslovak troops ordered by general Lev Prchala performed a surprise attack on the city of Munkács (now Mukacheve), in which the Carpathian Sich were as well involved, but the Rongyos Gárda with the help of the local police pushed them back. After this incident Döme Sztójay, the Hungarian ambassador in Berlin transferred a message to the German government in case of the German occupation of the Czech lands and the declaration of Slovak independence Hungary will occupy the rest of Carpathian Ruthenia, regardless of German approval. On March 11, the German ambassador in Budapest outlined in the German Government&#x27;s response if Hungary will maintain and uphold the economic contracts with Germany, respect the rights of the local Germans and would not persecute the members of the Volosin Cabinet, then in case of the proclamation of an independent Carpatho-Ukraine would be acquiescent regarding the Hungarian plans.

=== Proclamation of Independence ===
Slovak and Ukrainian nationalism grew more intense. On 10 March, the Hlinka Guard and &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; demonstrated, demanding independence from Czecho-Slovakia. In the evening of 13 March, Slovak leader Jozef Tiso and Ďurčanský met Adolf Hitler, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and Generals Walther von Brauchitsch and Wilhelm Keitel in Berlin.

Hitler made it absolutely clear: Slovakia could either declare independence immediately and associate itself with the Reich, or he would allow the Hungarians to take over the country – whom Ribbentrop reported were massing at the border. During the afternoon and night of 14 March, the Slovak parliament proclaimed independence from Czecho-Slovakia, and at 05:00 on 15 March 1939, Hitler declared the unrest in Czecho-Slovakia to be a threat to German national security. He sent his troops into Bohemia and Moravia, meeting virtually no resistance.

Following the Slovak proclamation of independence on March 14 and the Nazis&#x27; seizure of Czech lands on 15 March, Carpatho-Ukraine declared its independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, with the Reverend Avgustyn Voloshyn as head of state.. Voloshin was now supported by the population of Subcarpathia. The First Constitutional Law of Carpatho-Ukraine of 15 March 1939 defined the new country as follows:

# Carpatho-Ukraine is an independent state
# The name of the state is: Carpatho-Ukraine
# Carpatho-Ukraine is a republic, headed by a president elected by the of Carpatho-Ukraine
# The state language of Carpatho-Ukraine is the Ukrainian language
# The colors of the national flag of the Carpatho-Ukraine are blue and yellow, blue on top and yellow on the bottom
# The state emblem of Carpatho-Ukraine is as follows: a bear on a red field on the sinister side, four blue and three yellow stripes on the dexter side, as well as the trident of Saint Volodymyr the Great
# The national anthem of Carpatho-Ukraine is &quot;Ukraine has not perished&quot;
# This act comes valid immediately after its promulgation

The proclaimed Carpatho-Ukrainian government was headed by President Avgustyn Voloshyn, Prime Minister Julian Révaý, Minister of Defence Stepan Klochurak, and Minister of Internal Affairs Yuriy Perevuznyk. The head of the was Avhustyn Shtephan, his deputies were Fedir Révaý and Stepan Rosokha. The Slovak declaration of independence caused law and order to break down immediately. The Hungarians had learned that the Germans would not object to a Hungarian takeover of Carpatho-Ukraine on the same day.

===Hungarian invasion===

The Chief of General Staff of Hungary Henrik Werth asked for at least a week to prepare for the invasion, but the Royal Council gave him only 12 hours to occupy Carpathian Ruthenia before the declaration of Slovak independence. Responsible for preparation to the assault was appointed chief of Munkacs garrison Lajos Béldi who commanded 1st Mountain Brigade, while Lieutenant General Ferenc Szombathelyi (commander of the 8th Corps in Kassa) was placed in charge of the Carpathian Group as an expeditionary force.

The available Hungarian forces consisted of an infantry regiment, two cavalry regiments, three infantry battalions on bicycles, one motorized battalion, two border guard battalions, one artillery battalion and two armored trains. These forces were counting for more than two World War II divisions. They were supported by Fiat CR.32 fighter aircraft amounting to one squadron. In addition to regular units, Hungarians were also aided by several irregular formations such as the Rongyos Gárda and black-shirt guards of István Fenczik, who has been accused earlier as a Magyaron by the Volosin-cabinet.

The Hungarian Border Guard units stationed around Munkács, after throwing back the attacking Czecho-Slovak units on , pressed forward in turn, and took the town of Őrhegyalja (today Pidhoriany as part of Mukachevo).

On 15 March 1939, the Hungarian Army regular troops invaded Carpatho-Ukraine and by nightfall reached Szolyva. The Carpatho-Ukrainian irregular troops, the Carpathian Sich, without additional support, were quickly routed. The greatest battle between the Hungarian army and several hundred Ukrainian soldiers (armed with light machine guns, rifles, hand grenades and pistols) took place near Khust. About 230 Ukrainians died in the battle.

Czecho-Slovak resistance in Carpatho-Ukraine was negligible, and the advancing Hungarian troops did not have to face a well-organized and centralized resistance. The Hungarian Army also had the advantage of the First Vienna Award, which made it possible for the Hungarians to take possession of the area where the Czechs had built permanent fortifications to defend against Hungary.

On 16 March 1939, Hungary formally annexed the territory. Prime Minister Yulian Révaý had resisted the Hungarians until then. In the night to 17 March, the last Czecho-Slovak troops left Khust and retreated to Romanian borders. They and the one-day president of Carpatho-Ukraine, Voloshyn, fled to Romania.

The Royal Hungarian Army continued their advance, pushing forward at top speed, and reached the Polish border on 17 March. Those Sich members who came from the province of Galicia as Polish citizens were captured by the Hungarians and handed over to Polish soldiers for illegally crossing the border, then summarily executed. The last resistance in the Carpathian mountains was taken out on 18 March.

The invasion campaign was a success, but it also proved that the Hungarian Army was not yet ready for full war. The handicaps imposed by the Trianon Treaty were clearly visible, but the morale and nationalist spirit of the soldiers and the civilian populations were high , which was also important in building a strong national army.

=== World War II and aftermath ===
Following the German occupation of Hungary in March 1944, Adolf Eichmann oversaw the deportation of almost the entire Hungarian Jewish population; few survived the Holocaust. At the conclusion of the Battle of the Dukla Pass on , the Soviet Union had driven the Germans and Hungarians back and occupied Carpathian Ruthenia and the rest of western Ukraine. Control of Carpathian Ruthenia thus &quot;nominally&quot; reverted to Czechoslovakia. The delegation of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, led by minister František Němec, arrived in Khust to establish the provisional Czechoslovak administration, according to the treaties between the Soviet and Czechoslovak government that year.

However, after just a few weeks, for reasons that remain unclear, the Red Army and the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs started to obstruct the delegation&#x27;s work and finally a puppet &quot;National Committee of Transcarpatho-Ukraine&quot; was set up in Mukachevo under the protection of the Red Army. On 26 November this committee, led by Ivan Ivanovich Turyanitsa, a Rusyn who had deserted from the Czechoslovak army, proclaimed the &quot;will of Ukrainian people&quot; to separate from Czechoslovakia and to join the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. After two months of conflict and unsuccessful negotiations the Czechoslovak government delegation departed Khust on , leaving Carpatho-Ukraine under Soviet control.

The Soviet Union exerted pressure on Czechoslovakia, and on 29 June 1945, the two countries signed a treaty, officially ceding Carpatho-Ruthenia to the USSR. In 1946, the area became part of the Ukrainian SSR as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

== Parliament ==
The &quot;Soim&quot; of Carpatho-Ukraine was established on 12 February 1939 by the Czechoslovakian constitutional act of . It consisted of 32 representatives with 29 Ukrainians and three of national minorities. There was only a single session of the parliament that took place on in Khust.

At the session the parliament approved the proclamation of the sovereignty of Carpatho-Ukraine, adopted its Constitution, elected the president, and confirmed the new government of Julian Révaý. The head of the Soim became Augustin Štefan with his deputies, Fedir Révaý and Stepan Rosokha. The presidium of the Soim emigrated out of the country following the invasion of Carpatho-Ukraine by the Hungarian Armed Forces.

== Prosecution of Carpatho-Ukraine activists and government officials ==
* Sevastian Sabol (1909–2003), a native of Priashiv (Prešov) and a surviving victim of Soviet and Hungarian prosecutions. During the Hungarian invasion of Carpatho-Ukraine in 1939, he was a chaplain in Carpathian Sich in Khust. On 16–18 December 1948, in Prague, Sabol was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to life in prison for cooperation with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.
* Avgustyn Voloshyn (1874–1945), died in a Soviet prison after being arrested in Prague by SMERSH in 1945.

<doc id="452461" wikidata="Q186235" url="?curid=452461" title="Myocarditis">
<text>Myocarditis is inflammation of the cardiac muscle. Myocarditis can progress to inflammatory cardiomyopathy when there is associated ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction due to chronic inflammation. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest.
Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins and autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram (ECG), increased troponin, heart MRI, and occasionally a heart biopsy. An ultrasound of the heart is important to rule out other potential causes such as heart valve problems.

Treatment depends on both the severity and the cause. Medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics are often used. A period of no exercise is typically recommended during recovery. Corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be useful in certain cases. In severe cases an implantable cardiac defibrillator or heart transplant may be recommended.

In 2013, about 1.5 million cases of acute myocarditis occurred. While people of all ages are affected, the young are most often affected. It is slightly more common in males than females. Most cases are mild. In 2015 cardiomyopathy, including myocarditis, resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990. The initial descriptions of the condition are from the mid-1800s.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms associated with myocarditis are varied, and relate either to the actual inflammation of the myocardium or to the weakness and dysfunction of the heart muscle that is secondary to the inflammation. While myocarditis may develop over periods ranging from hours to months, patients typically present with signs and symptoms that resemble heart failure, including the following:
Since myocarditis is often due to a viral illness, many patients experience symptoms consistent with a recent viral infection including a fever, rash, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, joint pains, and easily becoming tired. Additionally, myocarditis is often associated with pericarditis, and many people with myocarditis present with signs and symptoms that suggest myocarditis and pericarditis at the same time.

Children primarily present with the aforementioned symptoms associated with a viral infection. Later stages of the illness can involve the respiratory system and lead to increased work of breathing. These are often mistaken for asthma.

Myocarditis can be distinguished as either fulminant or acute based on the severity of symptoms on presentation, as well as the time course over which symptoms develop and persist. This categorization can help predict the treatment, outcomes, and complications of myocarditis.

Fulminant myocarditis is defined as sudden and severe myocarditis that is associated with signs and symptoms of heart failure while at rest. More specifically, fulminant myocarditis is characterized by a distinct, rapid onset of severe heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain, that develop over the course of hours to days. Additionally, treatment requires the use of medications or mechanical devices to improve heart function.

Acute non-fulminant myocarditis has a less distinct onset in contrast to fulminant myocarditis, and evolves over days to months. While the symptoms of acute myocarditis overlap with those of fulminant myocarditis, they do not typically occur at rest, and treatment does not require the use of mechanical circulatory support.

== Causes ==
While many causes of myocarditis are known, there are many cases in which a causative agent cannot be identified. In Europe and North America, viruses are common culprits. Worldwide, however, the most common cause is Chagas disease, an illness endemic to Central and South America that results from infection with the protozoan &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;. Overall, myocarditis can be caused by infections, immune conditions, toxins, drug reactions, and physical injuries to the heart. 

=== Infections ===
The most common causes of myocarditis are infectious organisms. Viral infections are the most common cause in developed countries, with a majority of cases being caused by those with single-stranded RNA genomes, such as Coxsackie viruses (especially Coxsackie B3 and B5). Globally, Chagas disease is the leading cause of myocarditis, which results from infection with the protozoan &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi.&quot; Bacteria can also result in myocarditis, although it is rare in patients with normal heart function and without a preexisting immunodeficiency. A list of the most relevant infectious organisms is below.
* Viral: adenovirus, parvovirus B19, coxsackie virus, rubella virus, polio virus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2, causing COVID-19)
* Protozoan: &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; (causing Chagas disease and toxoplasmosis, respectively)
* Bacterial: &quot;Brucella&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, &quot;Tropheryma whipplei&quot;, &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, &quot;Borrelia burgdorferi&quot;, &quot;Leptospira&quot;, &quot;Rickettsia&quot;, &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;
* Fungal: &quot;Aspergillus&quot;
* Parasitic: &quot;Ascaris&quot;, &quot;Echinococcus granulosus&quot;, &quot;Paragonimus westermani&quot;, &quot;Schistosoma&quot;, &quot;Taenia solium&quot;, &quot;Trichinella spiralis&quot;, visceral larva migrans, &quot;Wuchereria bancrofti&quot;

=== Immune conditions ===
* Allergic reaction (e.g., to acetazolamide or amitriptyline)
* Kawasaki disease
* Autoimmunity (scleroderma, lupus, sarcoidosis, and systemic vasculitides)
* Toxic shock syndrome

=== Drug reactions and toxins ===
* Anthracyclines and other forms of chemotherapy
* Antipsychotics including clozapine
* Alcohol
* Stimulants such as mephedrone and cocaine
* Arsenic
* Carbon monoxide
* Snake venom
* Heavy metals (copper or iron)

==== Vaccination ====
* Myocarditis and pericarditis can be a side effect of some vaccines like the smallpox vaccine.
* Myocarditis can be a side-effect of the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines. The FDA and European Medicines Agency estimates the risk of myocarditis after the Covid-19 vaccine as 1 case per 100,000 of those who are vaccinated. The risk of myocarditis after Covid-19 vaccination was observed to be highest in males between 16–29 years of age, and after receiving the second dose of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine. For this group, incidence of myocarditis has been reported to be between 1 case in 2500 to 1 case per 10,000.

=== Physical injuries ===
* Electric shock
* Hyperpyrexia, and radiation

==Mechanism==
Most forms of myocarditis involve the infiltration of heart tissues by one or two types of pro-inflammatory blood cells, lymphocytes and macrophages plus two respective descendants of these cells, NK cells and macrophages. Eosinophilic myocarditis is a subtype of myocarditis in which cardiac tissue is infiltrated by another type of pro-inflammatory blood cell, the eosinophil. Eosinophilic myocarditis is further distinguished from non-eosinophilic myocarditis by having a different set of causes and recommended treatments.

The pathophysiology of viral myocarditis is not well understood, but it is believed to involve cardiotropic viruses (viruses with a high affinity for the heart muscle) gaining entry to cardiac muscle cells, usually via binding to a transmembrane receptor. Over approximately the next 1–7 days the virus replicates and causes inflammation leadings to necrosis and apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells (myocytes) and activation of the innate immune system. Over the next 1–4 weeks, viral replication continues with subsequent activation of the acquired immune system leading to T cell infiltration and the formation of antibodies, including possibly auto-antibodies. Over the next few months to years, this process either resolves and concludes with viral clearance or it may progress to cause permanent heart damage such as dilated cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction or other cardiomyopathies. Coxsackie B, specifically B3 and B5, has been found to interact with coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and decay-accelerating factor (DAF). However, other proteins have also been identified that allow Coxsackieviruses to bind to cardiac cells. The natural function of CAR and mechanism that the Coxsackievirus uses to infect the cardiac muscle is still unknown. The mechanism by which coxsackie B viruses (CBVs) trigger inflammation is believed to be through the recognition of CBV virions by Toll-like receptors.

The binding of many types of coronaviruses, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus, through ACE2 receptors present in heart muscle may be responsible for direct viral injury leading to myocarditis. In a study done during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak,  SARS viral RNA  was detected in the autopsy of heart specimens in 35% of the patients in the Toronto, Canada area who had died due to SARS. It was also observed that an already diseased heart has increased expression of ACE2 receptor contrasted to healthy individuals which may lead to greater viral infiltration in the heart muscle. Hyperactive immune responses in COVID-19 patients may lead to the initiation of the cytokine storm. This excess release of cytokines may lead to myocardial injury. In addition to direct cardiac myocyte (heart muscle cell) damage due to SARS-CoV-2 viral infiltration and inflammation, there are other suspected mechanisms that COVID-19 may indirectly cause myocarditis. During COVID-19, the other indirect mechanisms thought to contribute to myocarditis include: oxygen supply-demand mismatch to the heart muscle leading to myocardial (heart muscle) injury; microvascular thrombi, or blood clots in the small blood vessels of the heart causing injury; the systemic hyperinflammatory state in Covid-19 leading to heart muscle injury; or the virus causing indirect damage to the heart by inducing auto-immune mediated damage to the heart muscle (and frequently other organs).

== Diagnosis ==

Myocarditis refers to an underlying process that causes inflammation and injury of the heart. It does not refer to inflammation of the heart as a consequence of some other insult. Many secondary causes, such as a heart attack, can lead to inflammation of the myocardium and therefore the diagnosis of myocarditis cannot be made by evidence of inflammation of the myocardium alone.

Myocardial inflammation can be suspected on the basis of elevated inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or an increased IgM (serology) against viruses known to affect the myocardium. Markers of myocardial damage (troponin or creatine kinase cardiac isoenzymes) are elevated. The CRP and ESR are sometimes elevated in myocarditis but they are not specific as they may be elevated due to many other causes. Similarly, CK may be elevated in myocarditis but is also non-specific, as it may be elevated in myositis (skeletal muscle injury). High sensitivity troponin is usually elevated in myocarditis and this marker is very specific to myocardial (heart muscle) injury.

Myocardial inflammation may also be suspected based on ECG findings, but these findings are not specific to myocarditis. The ECG finding most commonly seen in myocarditis is sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST or T wave changes. But other findings that may be seen in perimyocarditis (a combination of pericarditis and myocarditis) include PR segment depression, PR segment depression with associated ST segment elevation, diffuse ST segment elevation (in a pericarditis pattern). ST segment elevation was seen in 62% of people with myocarditis. The presence of Q waves, a widened QRS complex, prolongation of the QT interval, high degree AV nodal blockade, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias are associated with a poor prognosis when seen on ECG in people with myocarditis.

The gold standard is the biopsy of the myocardium, in general done in the setting of angiography. A small tissue sample of the endocardium and myocardium is taken and investigated. The cause of the myocarditis can be only identified by a biopsy. Endomyocardial biopsy samples are assessed for histopathology (how the tissue looks like under the microscope): myocardial interstitium may show abundant edema and inflammatory infiltrate, rich in lymphocytes and macrophages. Focal destruction of myocytes explains the myocardial pump failure. In addition samples may be assessed with immunohistochemistry to determine which types of immune cells are involved in the reaction and how they are distributed. Furthermore, PCR and/or RT-PCR may be performed to identify particular viruses. Finally, further diagnostic methods like microRNA assays and gene-expression profile may be performed.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI or CMR) has been shown to be very useful in diagnosing myocarditis by visualizing markers for inflammation of the myocardium. Cardiac MRI is most sensitive when performed 2–3 weeks after the initial clinical presentation of myocarditis and may be repeated 6–12 months after onset to monitor the evolution of disease or response to treatment. The Lake Louise Criteria (established in 2009) are a commonly used MRI criteria to establish the diagnosis of myocarditis in suspected cases. The Lake Louise Criteria include increased signal intensity after gadolinium contrast enhancement (a sign of hyperemia, or increased blood flow to damaged tissue), increased myocardial T2 relaxation time or an increased T2 signal intensity (which are signs of tissue edema or swelling), and late gadolinium contrast enhancement (which is a sign of tissue necrosis (tissue damage) or fibrosis (scarring)). In 2018, additional radiographic MRI criteria were added, including increased T1 signal intensity and increased extracellular volume (both of which being signs of myocardial injury). The original 2009 Lake Louise Criteria had a 74% sensitivity and 86% specificity in the diagnosis of myocarditis, but when adding the 2018 update to the criteria (in which T1 signal intensity was found to have high diagnostic sensitivity), the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of myocarditis increased to 88% and 96% respectively. Cardiac MRI, if available, is recommended in all cases of suspected myocarditis.

== Treatment ==
While myocarditis has many etiologies and a variable constellation of signs and symptoms, many causes do not have a specific treatment thus the primary focus is on supportive care and symptom management. In some cases of biopsy-proven myocarditis, the causative cell type may indicate condition specific treatments that are beneficial. These treatments typically consist of corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants. Eosinophilic myocarditis, giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis are usually responsive to immunosuppressive treatments; in the form of glucocorticoids with or without azathioprine and cyclosporine. Some of these immune mediated forms of myocarditis require an extended course (maintenance course) of immunosuppressive therapy. It is recommended to rule out drugs and parasites as potential causes of eosinophilic myocarditis as these common causes of the variant can be effectively treated with discontinuation of the offending drug or specific anti-parasitic treatment respectively. Empiric IV glucocorticoids are indicated in acute myocarditis with cardiogenic shock, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias or high degree AV block that is suspected due to auto-immune disease; but the European Society of Cardiology also recommends subsequent viral genome testing of endomyocardial biopsy specimens due to risk of viral activation, which may necessitate discontinuation of immunosuppression therapy.

In a majority of cases, the main therapies are used to support patients and are dependent on the severity of symptoms and the time course across which myocarditis develops. Supportive therapies can be divided into two broad categories, medications and mechanical support.

===Medication===
The specific medications that are used to support patients are directly related to the cause of the symptom or sign. Just as the symptoms of myocarditis mirror those of congestive heart failure, so too do the therapies. Additionally, the order in which therapies are used depends on the degree of heart dysfunction, with stabilization of patient blood pressure and breathing taking highest priority when present. This can involve the use of inotropes, or medications that make the heart contract with greater force, as well as antiarrhythmic drugs such as adenosine or carvedilol. In patients that have stable and adequate heart function, further treatments are based on heart failure guidelines. ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) can have a protective benefit to the heart, so either are typically used in any patient with symptomatic myocarditis. Simultaneously, beta blockers are used in patients that can tolerate their heart beating at a slower rate. Shortness of breath at rest and swelling can be relieved with diuretics such as furosemide, and the addition of aldosterone receptor blockers can augment the diuresis while preventing the excess loss of potassium. In patients with symptoms while resting, additional medications can be added such as digoxin.

===Mechanical support===
Mechanical support is used in cases of myocarditis in which medications alone do not lead to adequate heart function and the body requires additional support to achieve organ perfusion. Myocarditis cases that require mechanical circulatory support are categorized as fulminant by definition. People that require additional support with their heart function can benefit from the use of ventricular assist devices like intra-aortic balloon pumps. In people with myocarditis severe enough to cause cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used to adequately pump blood and provide oxygen if needed. Both ventricular assist devices and ECMO can be used as bridge therapy until heart transplantation in patients that are candidates. Heart transplantation is reserved for those that do not respond to the aforementioned conventional medical therapies. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is sometimes required in those with cardiomyopathy or heart failure caused by myocarditis due to the risk of fatal ventricular arrhythmias. The need for ICD is usually assessed 3–6 months after the onset of myocarditis, after the acute phase of myocarditis has passed, with a temporary, wearable cardioverter-defibrillator acting as a temporary treatment in the interim.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis associated with myocarditis is stratified by the severity and time course along which symptoms develop. In addition to symptom severity, there are also several indicators of heart function that can be used to predict patient outcomes, many of which are part of the standard evaluation of patients presenting with cardiovascular dysfunction. Most people with myocarditis have an uncomplicated, self-limited and mild course while making a full recovery. However, those with myocarditis that present with a decreased ejection fraction, or those who present with heart failure, advanced atrioventricular block, with sustained ventricular arrhythmias or with hemodynamic instability have a worse prognosis with an increased risk of death or need for heart transplantation.

An electrocardiogram is one of the most common screening tools used in cases of suspected cardiac pathology, such as myocarditis. The findings that correlate with poorer outcomes are non-specific and include widened QRS complexes and QT intervals, partial or complete atrial-ventricular heart block, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias like sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Electrocardiogram findings of ST elevations with upward concavity and an early repolarization pattern, however, were associated with a better cardiovascular prognosis in general.

In cases of acute myocarditis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can reveal several prognostic indicators that, similar to ECGs, are non-specific and reflect poorer cardiac physiology. Late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI demonstrates perturbations in extracellular volume as a result of cell necrosis or edema, and is significantly associated with increases in all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events. The association was strongest with any late gadolinium enhancement, but remained true for findings of anterolateral-specific enhancement. A similar relationship was found between a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50%, increased mortality, and increased major adverse cardiovascular events.

Myocarditis has been reported to be a major cause of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in infants, adolescents, and young adults, but the reported rates show wide variation (1 to 14 percent) among young people depending on differences in SCD definition and classification/ definition of myocarditis post-mortem as well as heterogeneity of study populations.

In &quot;fulminant&quot; myocarditis, in which an inflammatory cytokine storm occurs, cardiac functions decline rapidly and the death rate is high.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of myocarditis is estimated to be about 1-10 cases per 100,000 persons per year, with higher estimates at 22 cases per 100,000 persons annually. The highest incidence of myocarditis is seen in men between the ages of 20 and 40. Fulminant myocarditis, the most severe subtype, has been shown to occur in up to 2.5% of known myocarditis presentations. When looking at different causes of myocarditis, viral infection is the most prevalent, especially in children; however, the prevalence rate of myocarditis is often underestimated as the condition is easily overlooked and is sometimes asymptomatic. Viral myocarditis being an outcome of viral infection depends heavily on genetic host factors and the pathogenicity unique to the virus. If one tests positive for an acute viral infection, clinical developments have discovered that 1-5% of said population may show some form of myocarditis.

In regard to the population affected, myocarditis is more common in pregnant women, children, and those who are immunocompromised. Myocarditis, however, has shown to be more common in the male population than in the female. Multiple studies report a 1:1.3-1.7 female-male ratio of prevalence of myocarditis. In young adults, up to 20% of all cases of sudden death are due to myocarditis. Young males specifically have a higher incidence rate than any other population due to their testosterone levels creating a greater inflammatory response that increases the chance of cardiac pathologies. While males tend to have a higher risk of developing myocarditis, females tend to display more severe signs and symptoms, such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, but do so at an older age. Among patients with HIV, myocarditis is the most common cardiac pathological finding at autopsy, with a prevalence of 50% or more.

Myocarditis is the third most common cause of death among young adults with a cumulative incidence rate globally of 1.5 cases per 100,000 persons annually. Myocarditis accounts for approximately 20% of sudden cardiac death in a variety of populations, including adults under the age of 40, young athletes, United States Air Force recruits, and elite Swedish orienteers. With individuals who develop myocarditis, the first year is difficult as a collection of cases have shown there is a 20% mortality rate.

=== Myocarditis and COVID-19 ===
Myocarditis can be seen during COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus; with the myocarditis being associated with a spectrum of severities from asymptomatic to fulminant. The symptoms for myocarditis following a COVID-19 infection can present as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and irregular heartbeats which can make the accurate diagnosis of myocarditis challenging. In one cohort study, comparing the autopsy reports of 277 hearts of people who died from COVID-19, clinically significant myocarditis was seen in approximately 2% of hearts. Other estimates of the incidence of myocarditis in those with COVID-19 range from 2.4 cases of definite/probable myocarditis (based on clinical criteria) per 1,000 people with COVID-19 to 4.1 cases per 1,000 persons in those who are hospitalized with COVID-19.

Although myocarditis is relatively rare in those with COVID-19, when it is present it is likely to follow a severe and fulminant course for those previously hospitalized with COVID-19. Of those with COVID-19 and myocarditis, 39% presented with severe myocarditis associated with hemodynamic instability, needing mechanical circulation support or other major interventions. Severe myocarditis in COVID-19 is also more likely in those who have COVID-19 pneumonia.

Myocarditis is a rare adverse side effect from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

==History==
Cases of myocarditis have been documented as early as the 1600s, but the term &quot;myocarditis&quot;, implying an inflammatory process of the myocardium, was introduced by German physician Joseph Friedrich Sobernheim in 1837. However, the term has been confused with other cardiovascular conditions, such as hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Following admonition regarding the indiscriminate use of myocarditis as a diagnosis from authorities such as British cardiologist Sir Thomas Lewis and American cardiologist and co-founder of the American Heart Association Paul White, myocarditis was under-diagnosed.

Although myocarditis is clinically and pathologically clearly defined as &quot;inflammation of the myocardium&quot;, its definition, classification, diagnosis, and treatment are subject to continued controversy, but endomyocardial biopsy has helped define the natural history of myocarditis and clarify clinicopathological correlations.

<text>Joan Peters (née Friedman; April 29, 1936 – January 5, 2015), later Caro, was an American journalist and broadcaster. She wrote the 1984 book &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot;, a controversial book that incorrectly claimed that modern Palestinians were not indigenous to Palestine.

==Life==
Peters was born in Chicago. She studied at the University of Illinois without earning a degree and became a freelance writer for publications like &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. She became &quot;fascinated by the Middle East while covering the Yom Kippur War as a freelancer for CBS in 1973&quot;. 
Her first marriage, to Gary Peters, ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to Stanley Kaplan, lasted until his death in 1991. She married William A. Caro in 1997 and went by the name Joan Caro.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, Peters wrote for magazines such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;The New Leader&quot;, was a consultant in the creation of CBS news documentaries in 1973 about the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and provided commentary on the subject for PBS. Her dedication to the cause of Israel may have been triggered by a visit in the 1970s to the Soviet Union, where officials treated her and her husband with suspicion.

According to the Walker Agency, which booked speaking and touring engagements for her, Peters also served as an adviser to the White House on American foreign policy in the Middle East during the Carter administration.

In &quot;From Time Immemorial&quot; (1984), she argued that Palestinians are largely not indigenous to modern Israel and therefore have no claim to its territory. The book became controversial and its central claims were discredited by reputable scholars shortly after its publication. Scholars and writers across the political spectrum such as Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, Edward Said Yehoshua Porath, and Ian Gilmour and David Gilmour criticized it.

Peters died at her home in Chicago in 2015 of a cerebral embolism. Shortly before her death, the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Ron Prosor, telephoned to convey to her that Israel&#x27;s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was deeply grateful for her work.

==Awards==

<text>Cox&#x27;s Bazar District () is a district in the Chittagong Division of Bangladesh.
It is named after Cox&#x27;s Bazar town. It is located south of Chittagong. Cox&#x27;s Bazar is also known by the names &quot;Panowa&quot; (&quot;yellow flower&quot;) and &quot;Palongkee&quot;. The modern Cox&#x27;s Bazar derives its name from Captain Hiram Cox (died 1799), an army officer who served in British India. It is one of the fishing ports of Bangladesh, and contains one of the world&#x27;s longest natural sea beaches ( long including mud flats).

In 1984, during the Ershad government, Cox&#x27;s Bazar district was established by dividing Chittagong district. Today, Cox&#x27;s Bazar is a major tourist destination within Bangladesh.

==Geography==
Cox&#x27;s Bazar District has an area of . It is bounded by Chittagong District on the north, Bay of Bengal in the south, Bandarban District on the east, and the Bay of Bengal on the west. Major rivers include Matamuhuri, Bakkhali, Reju Khal, Naf River, Maheshkhali channel and Kutubdia channel. The area of the city of Cox&#x27;s Bazar is .

==History==
The known history of Cox&#x27;s Bazar begins in the Mughal period. On his way to Arakan, when the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja (1616–1660) passed through the hilly terrain of the present day Cox&#x27;s Bazar, he was attracted to the scenic nature of the region. He commanded his forces to camp there. A place named &quot;Dulahazara&quot;, meaning &quot;one thousand palanquins&quot;, still exists in the area.

Cox&#x27;s Bazar is named after Captain Hiram Cox, an officer of the East India Company, who was assigned with the charges of the current day Cox&#x27;s Bazar and its adjacent areas. The town of Cox&#x27;s Bazar was established in 1799 as a market town to honour Captain Cox. In 1854, Cox&#x27;s Bazar was made a Sub Divisional headquarter in Chittagong district under the Bengal Presidency of British India.

After the end of British rule in 1947, Cox&#x27;s Bazar remained a part of East Pakistan under the Dominion of Pakistan till 1971. Captain Advocate Fazlul Karim was the first chairman after independence from the British of Cox&#x27;s Bazar municipality. He established the Tamarisk Forest along the beach to draw tourism to the town and to protect the beach from the tide. He donated many of his father-in-law&#x27;s and his own lands to establish a public library and town hall. In 1971, the wharf was used as a naval port by the Pakistan Navy&#x27;s gunboats. This and the nearby airstrip of the Pakistan Air Force were the scene of intense shelling by the Indian Navy during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.

In the year 1984, Cox&#x27;s Bazar was upgraded into a District from a Sub Division under the Chittagong Division.

Starting in 2017, a &quot;mass human exodus&quot; of the Rohingya Muslim minority group from neighboring Myanmar&#x27;s Rakhine State has led to Cox&#x27;s Bazar housing the &quot;world&#x27;s largest refugee settlement&quot; over the following years.

<text>Antigo ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Langlade County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 8,100 at the 2020 census. Antigo is the center of a farming and lumbering district, and its manufactured products consist principally of lumber, chairs, furniture, sashes, doors and blinds, hubs and spokes, and other wood products.

== History ==
The name Antigo is derived from the Ojibwe phrase &quot;niibin-inaandagoog-ziibiing&quot;, meaning &quot;summer balsam firs by the river&quot;, which was recorded by early settlers as &quot;nequi-antigo-sebi&quot;. An alternate etymology, &quot;nibii-aamijiwan-ziibiing&quot;, seems to be derived from &quot;mookijiwan-ziibiwishenh&quot;, &quot;spring little-river&quot;, which became the name of the river which runs through modern Antigo, Spring Brook. This alternate etymology lives on in the name of Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation near Pearson.

The region that is now Langlade County originally belonged to the Menominee, with several Ojibwe and Potawatomi groups migrating to the area from the east throughout the 16th-19th centuries. During this time, the Ojibwe waged and won a major war against the eastern Dakota people, driving them out of Wisconsin and Minnesota and securing the area&#x27;s wild rice beds for themselves.

By the mid-1800s, the Eau Claire River and its branches to the west of modern Antigo formed a boundary between the Ojibwe, Menominee, and Ho-Chunk tribes. The first permanent European-American settler in Langlade County was Willard Ackley, who arrived in 1853 from New York and established a trading post. He married an Ojibwe woman and became close with what is today the Sokaogon Chippewa Community.

The city was founded in 1876 by Francis A. Deleglise, accompanied by George Eckart. The log cabin in which Deleglise lived is preserved and on display at the Langlade County Historical Society Museum. A street in Antigo also bears his name. The city gained its charter in 1883.

In the early part of the 1900s, Antigo was best known for its sawmills. At the turn of the millennium, the city&#x27;s economy had a balance of industry and agriculture. High on the list are potatoes, dairy products, fur, shoes, fertilizer, steel, and aluminum products, along with the lumber and wood product industries established in the earlier years. 

On April 24, 2016, a former Antigo High School student shot two students with a rifle during prom. As he approached the school with a rifle a police officer who was already on the scene shot him. He later died at a Wausau hospital.

In June 13, 2019, the Antigo Baseball team won its first D2 state title. With a record of 21-5 the Robins faced off against Union Grove and won 8-3.

A post office called Antigo was established in 1879. It has remained in operation ever since. The post office is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Horse racing===
Antigo has a rich history of horse racing that dates back more than a century, with documented races being held as early as the 1890s at the Langlade County Fairgrounds. 

A mural, located near the southwest intersection of U.S. Highway 45 and Fifth Avenue in Antigo, commemorates the deep ties Antigo still holds with the industry.

Local riding associations, such as the Antigo Trotting Association (which held harness horse races), remained steadily active through the mid-20th century. The Rotary Derby Days, another popular series, emerged in the 1970s and persisted into the early 1980s. In the 1960s, the Wisconsin Horse Racing Association was established in Antigo, fostering a professional racing community reaching throughout the state. Racers journeyed along a circuit stretching from Antigo to Wittenberg, Shawano, Fond du Lac, and even reaching professional tracks in Illinois and beyond.

Today, Antigo&#x27;s name remains recognizable as the birthplace of many famous horse trainers of the 20th century in cities such as Ocala, Florida. Perhaps the most well-known horse trainer from the area, D. Wayne Lukas, is a U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee who grew up in Antigo. Lukas has won 14 Triple Crown races, 20 Breeders&#x27; Cup titles and has been honored with numerous awards by the industry over his lengthy career.

==Parks and recreation==
The Clara R McKenna Aquatic Center, opened in 2005 and located adjacent to the Antigo High School, offers Antigo area residents a year-round recreation pool and lap pool.

The Langlade County Fairgrounds, located in Antigo, features a multipurpose building that serves as an indoor ice rink in winter and accommodates mainly 4-H activities in other seasons. The racetrack, which was used for horse racing in the 20th century, today functions to primarily serve off-road, stock car racing and demolition derbies in the summer. Other facilities include a livestock barn, horse barn, poultry/rabbit barn and a large bleacher grandstand overlooking the horse arena and racetrack.

==Education==
Public schools in Antigo are administered by the Antigo Unified School District. Public schools within the city include: East Elementary School, North Elementary School, West Elementary School, Antigo Middle School, and Antigo High School. 
The Antigo High School&#x27;s soccer team is currently the best it&#x27;s ever been in program history, with a record of 40-5 in the last three seasons. 

In addition to the public schools, there are two parochial schools in Antigo which each serve grades kindergarten through eighth: Peace Lutheran School (Peace Lutheran Church) and All Saints Catholic School (St. John&#x27;s Catholic Church).

<doc id="452476" wikidata="Q5631925" url="?curid=452476" title="HMS Colossus (1787)">
<text>HMS &quot;Colossus&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. She was launched at Gravesend on 4 April 1787 and lost on 10 December 1798. During her years of service she participated in the Battle of Groix, the Battle of Cape St Vincent, and the Battle of the Nile. While carrying wounded from the latter, she was wrecked at the Isles of Scilly. The wreck is a Protected Wreck managed by Historic England.

==Early history==
On 6 June 1793, in the Bay of Biscay, she captured &quot;Vanneau&quot;, a tiny vessel with an armament of just six guns, which the Royal Navy took into service. The same year, &quot;Colossus&quot; was part of a large fleet of 51 warships of numerous types, including a Spanish squadron, but commanded overall by Vice Admiral Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood.

==Siege of Toulon==

The Fleet arrived off Toulon on 26 August 1793, with Lord Hood in the warship . The objective was to keep the French Fleet in check. In Toulon&#x27;s port were 58 French warships, and Lord Hood was determined not to allow such a potent and dangerous fleet to be taken over by French revolutionary forces. The Bourbons, the Royalists of France, had managed to retain control of Toulon, a vital Mediterranean port. Upon the arrival of the British Fleet, the Bourbons duly surrendered the town and ships to Hood.

Sailors and Royal Marines began to land at Toulon from the ships of the Royal Navy Fleet, with the objective of taking possession of the key forts, which they succeeded in doing. The French Republican forces quickly mobilised, and began the siege of Toulon on 7 September. By 15 December, the British and Spanish withdrew, taking with them 15,000 Royalists, as well as destroying the dockyards and a large number of French warships. The Royal Navy lost 10 ships after the French captured the heights overlooking the harbour.

In 1795, &quot;Colossus&quot; was once again part of a large fleet action, the Battle of Groix. A fleet of 25 ships commanded by Admiral Lord Bridport on his flagship, , fought a French fleet of 23 warships under the command of Rear-Admiral Villaret-Joyeuse. The battle was immense and chaotic, and raged across a vast area, yet it came to an indecisive end, when Bridport ordered his Fleet to cease fighting at 7.15am, just four hours after the initial fighting had started. This decision allowed nine important French warships to escape. &quot;Colossus&quot; received damage, suffering three killed and thirty wounded. In total, British losses were 31 killed and 113 wounded. French losses are not known; it is estimated over 670 French sailors were killed or wounded, during skirmishes that resulted in the capture of three French warships.

Though &quot;Colossus&quot; was involved in much bitter fighting, her Scots captain, John Monkton, ordered his kilt-wearing piper to proceed to the maintop mast staysail netting and play the pipes throughout the battle, no doubt to the bemusement of the French sailors who witnessed it.

==Battle of Cape St. Vincent==
In February 1797, &quot;Colossus&quot; (now commanded by Captain George Murray) was involved in yet another large-scale clash of fleets in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent. She was part of a 21-ship strong fleet (including 7 smaller craft) under the command of Admiral John Jervis in his flagship HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, against a Spanish Fleet of 27 ships commanded by Lieutenant-General Don José de Córdoba y Ramos. &quot;Colossus&quot; sustained serious damage, her sails being virtually shot away. It looked inevitable that she would be raked by Spanish warships, until headed for &quot;Colossus&quot; and covered her.

The battle was a major victory for the Royal Navy. Despite being outnumbered, it captured four Spanish ships and crippled seven, including the largest warship afloat at that time - the &quot;Santísima Trinidad&quot;. Britain lost approximately 300 killed or wounded; the Spanish lost 1,092 killed or wounded, and 2,300 taken prisoner.

==Other action==
As the fleet repaired at Naples &quot;Colossus&quot; was immediately sent &quot;on a cruise off Malta&quot;. She then went to Gibraltar before returning to the now repaired fleet in Naples. In the summer, William Bolton (later Captain) was promoted to Lieutenant on the &quot;Colossus&quot;, and the ship on the obverse of the 1797 medal featuring William Bolton may represent &quot;Colossus&quot;.
&quot;Colossus&quot; was not cannibalized; Captain Murray did, however, hand over to Nelson three of his guns and one bower anchor. This was done as &quot;Colossus&quot; had been ordered home to England, whereas the was staying within the war zone. Loaded with Greek vases and wounded men from the battle of the Nile, &quot;Colossus&quot; set off for home. She stopped at Algiers and at Lisbon on the way. At Lisbon she joined a larger convoy that was &quot;bound for Ireland and other northern ports&quot;. The convoy dispersed in the English Channel as planned.

=== Shipwreck===

Amidst the bad winter weather &quot;Colossus&quot; sighted the Isles of Scilly first and came to anchor in St Mary&#x27;s Roads on 7 December. For three days she intended to ride out the storm, only for it to increase. On the night of 10 December an anchor cable parted and the ship ran aground on a submerged ledge of rock off Samson Island. Only one life was lost, that of Quartermaster Richard King who drowned when he fell overboard while trying to sound the lead. Boats were immediately put out from the island, and all of the other crew were transported to safety by the morning. On 11 December the ship settled on her side, the starboard beam ends touching the waves. Attempts to reboard her were thwarted by continued high seas.

On 15 December &quot;Colossus&quot;″ mainmast and bowsprit broke away and it became clear she could no longer be refloated. A naval brig, , was able to put alongside the shipwrecked vessel on 29 December and bring away a quantity of stores and the body of Admiral Molyneux Shuldam which had been transported aboard &quot;Colossus&quot; for reburial in England. No further salvage proved possible and the vessel sank entirely in early January 1799.

==Modern discovery and protection==
In the closing years of the 1960s, Roland Morris, a marine salver, began diving on the site, searching for the antiquities that &quot;Colossus&quot; had been transporting. In 1974, he discovered &quot;Colossus&quot;, as well as fragments from the collection of Sir William Hamilton which &quot;Colossus&quot; had been transporting. Many of the items found were reconstructed and are now displayed at the British Museum in London.

In 2000, a report from amateur diver Todd Stevens alerted the Receiver of Wreck to the existence of further remains. As a result of this new discovery the Isles of Scilly Museum in Hugh Town was handed a vast collection of artefacts from this wreck for display. These new remains turned out to be the stern of the wreck, which held a large carving from the stern port quarter gallery. This carving was claimed to have been discovered by local diver Carmen Stevens but not reported until the following year when the wreck site was designated on 4 July 2001 under the Protection of Wrecks Act as a result of the find when reported meaning that diving or other interference within 300 metres of the site was not permitted without a licence.

In August 2001 the Archaeological Diving Unit of the University of St Andrews obtained a survey licence and carried out a pre-disturbance survey of the site. The &quot;Colossus&quot; carving was recovered from the site in 2002 (as shown in a &quot;Time Team&quot; TV special in October 2002) and after conservation by the Mary Rose Trust, was returned to Scilly in 2010 to be placed on display in the Valhalla figurehead collection on Tresco Island. Further extensive licensed surveys were carried out by the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Archaeological Society from 2003 to 2005.

Exploration of the wreck is ongoing year on year by Survey Licence Holder Todd Stevens and IMAG (The Islands Maritime Archaeological Group) who have produced an overall site plan of the whole wreck site. The Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Maritime Archaeology Society (CISMAS) has been routinely inspecting and recording the site since 2001. The CISMAS projects are funded and endorsed by Historic England (at the time called English Heritage). In May 2012 CISMAS embarked on an excavation of a portion of the stern of the wreck, focusing on recording finds related to the gun deck and on initiating a long-term reburial trial.

New wreck material was found in the vicinity of the stern in 2014, prompting further excavation work in 2015. This raised new questions about the wrecking process which was investigated in 2017, leading to a new wrecking theory.

In 2018 Historic England published the investigation and conservation of artefacts from HMS &quot;Colossus&quot;, thought to be a small concentration of personal items (50 buttons, a bone brush/ shoe horn and a textile fragment) recovered under a surface recovery license by the 2014 Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Maritime Archaeological Society (CISMAS) team. The objects were analysed and stabilised by the Historic England conservation lab, at Fort Cumberland, Portsmouth.

<doc id="452486" wikidata="Q2328825" url="?curid=452486" title="Stage box">
<text>A stage box is an interface device used in sound reinforcement and recording studios to connect equipment to a mixing console. It provides a central location to connect microphones, instruments, and speakers to a multicore cable (snake), which allows the sound desk to be further from the stage and simplifies setup.

Stage boxes typically consist of a rugged metal enclosure, with XLR connectors on the front whose signals are routed through a snake. In the traditional sense, a stage box is effectively a simple termination box at the end of an analog multicore cable. However, many modern stage boxes convert between analog and digital, using a single twisted pair cable instead of an analog multicore.

==Design==

Stage boxes typically house 16–32 female XLR connectors and 4–8 male connectors, but occasionally phone connectors are used instead. These connections to the mixer are often called &quot;sends&quot; (inputs) and &quot;returns&quot; (outputs). The connector configuration depends on the number of conductors in the multicore cable (for analog signals), or the bandwidth (for digital signals). Some stage boxes are rack-mountable which allows them to be mounted in either a road case or equipment rack. Smaller stage boxes use compact metal cases which may sit on a stage inconspicuously. Labels on the stage box make it easier to identify cables for troubleshooting and setup.

Many stage boxes, especially digital ones, include microphone preamps. This is intended to amplify the signal as early as possible in the signal flow in order to minimize interference in the cabling. However, this is unfavorable for some sound engineers who prefer the tone of a specific preamp. Another feature of some stage boxes is integrated DI interfaces for direct connection of instruments.

==Digital stage boxes==


Digital mixing consoles inherently introduce conversion between analog and digital signals. Since digital signals are practically immune to noise, it is preferable to use them for long cable runs. As a result, many modern stage boxes contain an array of DACs and ADCs. This allows all the signals to be transmitted over a single twisted pair cable rather than a bulkier and more expensive analog multicore. Digital stage boxes are typically easier to set up and more reliable than their analog counterparts, and their cables are much more compact. Some digital stage boxes are designed for use with analog mixers, and this type include a corresponding converter box which is located at the mixing console. This converts the input signals back to analog to feed in the mixer. Others are intended for use with a digital mixer, and a cable can be connected directly from the stage box to the mixer, or through an Ethernet switch in some cases.

One of the main disadvantages of digital stage boxes, and digital audio systems in general, is their latency which is introduced in the analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion processes. Latency is cumulative through all devices in the signal flow, so more complex networks, especially Ethernet-based ones, can experience latency significant enough to cause an audible delay. This was originally a major drawback of digital stage boxes, but recent systems have lowered latency to insignificant levelstypically 2–3 ms.

Common cables used for digital stage boxes are Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 7, and fiber-optic cable. The EtherCON locking connector is commonly used for twisted pair cables. Whilst these cables may be informally referred to as &quot;ethernet&quot;, they do not necessarily use the Ethernet protocol, merely the same cables. Many manufacturers use proprietary standards for the transmission of digital audio, for example Behringer&#x27;s ULTRANET, Digigram&#x27;s EtherSound or Allen &amp; Heath&#x27;s dSNAKE. Open standards such as AES10 (used by DiGiCo, Soundcraft, Yamaha etc.) and AES50 (used by Midas, Behringer, Klark Teknik) also exist.

==Usage==
In a live setting, all of the microphones and musical instruments on stage connect to the stage box, which then connects to the mixing console with a single cable. This is usually more practical than running many individual cables between the stage and the mixer, especially for touring systems. Stage boxes are sometimes also used to connect speakers to a mixereither foldbacks or front-of-house speakers. Some sound engineers connect wireless microphone receivers to the stage box and position them in the same rack next to the stage.

In recording studios, stage boxes are used to connect the control room and the live room. They are commonly rack-mounted or mounted on walls in studios, in contrast to the portable method of installation used for live sound.

==Drop boxes==

Smaller stage boxes (typically with 2 or 4 connectors) with shorter multicore cables are called &quot;drop boxes&quot;. These are typically used to carry microphone signals from one side of the stage to the other, or as an extension cable for a few channels on a larger stage box. The multicore cable attached to a drop box is often called a &quot;subsnake&quot;, although this may also refer to the entire assembly of drop box and multicore cable.

<text>An audio multicore cable (often colloquially referred to as a multicore, snake cable or snake) is a thick cable which usually contains 4–64 individual audio cables inside a common, sturdy outer jacket. Audio multicore cables are used to convey many audio signals between two locations, such as in audio recording, sound reinforcement, PA systems and broadcasting. Multicores often route many signals from microphones or musical instruments to a mixing console, and can also carry signals from a mixing console back to speakers.

In audio engineering, the term &quot;multicore&quot; may refer to the several things:
*an unterminated length of multicore cable intended for analog audio signals (a type of cable harness)
*a terminated cable, with a multipin connector or many individual connectors
*the entire assembly of a terminated multicore cable and stage box

==Applications==
Multicores usually create a link between the stage and sound desk, or live room and control room. When used in sound reinforcement, the multicore cable runs from the stage box or microphone splitter to the front-of-house sound desk, where it connects to a mixing console. Portable multicore cables, stored loose or on a drum, enable sound systems to be set up at temporary outdoor locations such as music festivals. Permanent installations, especially recording studios, use stage boxes mounted in the floor or walls, with the multicore cable running through the ceiling or false floor.

Without a snake, a rock band performing onstage, for example, would require 20 or more individual microphone cables running from the stage to the mixing console (typically located at the rear of a venue). This would be harder to set up, would cause tangled cables, and it would be difficult to identify each cable.

==Varieties==
===Terminations===
Different termination methods can be used on each end to suit the application. When individual connectors are used, three pin XLR connectors are most common, although phone connectors are occasionally used. An end with many individual connectors fanning out is sometimes called a &quot;tail&quot; or &quot;fanout&quot;, and generally connects directly to a mixing console.

The number of connectors on a multicore is often specified by notation such as &quot;8/4&quot; or &quot;8×4&quot; for 8 sends and 4 returns. &quot;Sends&quot; usually connect a microphone to a mixing console, and &quot;returns&quot; connect a mixing console to speakers. A snake with only returns is often called a &quot;drive snake&quot;.

Some systems use large multipin connectors, colloquially called &quot;mults&quot;, which make it easier to join snakes togetherfor example, to connect subsnakes to a main stage box. This allows the system to be expanded by channel count or length. Connectors based on MIL-DTL-5015 (historically MIL-C-5015) are common. Alternatives include EDAC, Burndy, and DB-25 connectors.

While the sound reinforcement industry often uses proprietary premade multicores, the television broadcasting industry uses a standardized 12-channel multicore, with a common 37-pin connector on each end known as DT12. Only 36 pins are used and sometimes the unused pin is omitted. DT12 snakes are commonly built into sports venues and stadiums for easy connection of outside broadcasting trucks.
===Subsnakes===

A &quot;subsnake&quot; usually refers to a smaller multicore cable, or one not connected directly to the mixing console. Subsnakes may be used to connect a few instruments from one side of the stage to the main snake, which is neater and allows for shorter patch cables. Subsnakes use smaller stage boxes called &quot;drop boxes&quot;.

===Composite multicores===
Composite multicores combine different types of signals in the one cable. They may contain coaxial cores for video, twisted pair for data or low voltage cores for mains power. Composite multicores are usually used to connect professional video cameras, but they are now gaining usage in live event support with the introduction of the Yamaha PM1D which uses a composite cable to connect it to the stage box.

===Breakout cables===
An audio multicore may also function as a type of breakout cable, sometimes referred to as a &quot;fan&quot; or some variation, if it has a compound (multipin) connector on one end and individual connectors on the other. This is more common in short multicores meant for in-studio connections, such as audio engines, analog-to-digital converters or digital mixing consoles. Multicore cables may also connect to either the front or back of patch panels, when the patch panel is used as an access point or breakout box for connecting external inputs and outputs.

== Cable construction ==
:&quot;In this section, core refers to a single channel within a multicore cable, whilst conductor refers to a single wire.&quot;

=== Core conductor arrangement ===
The vast majority of audio multicore cables consist of a number of twisted-pair copper wires, suitable for balanced audio. To reduce noise, the shield of each channel is often isolated from the other shields. Balanced connections may use XLR connectors or TRS phone connectors .

The broadcast industry tends to use audio multicores containing star quad cables, due to their increased rejection of radio-frequency interference. Some multicore cables designed for unbalanced audio are made, and they contain a number of single-core screened cables.

=== Core screening ===

The individual cables inside the multicore are usually screened independently. This reduces crosstalk between cables and also enables each cable to have a screen or ground that is isolated from other cables, significantly reducing the possibility of ground loops which can cause unwanted hum.

A foil-screen is typically used, comprising thin aluminium wrapped around the group of conductors. An uninsulated drain wire is contained inside the screen to facilitate ground connection. A less common construction is a lapped or braided screen comprising thin wires wrapped around the conductors. This gives improved flexibility, but less effective screening.

=== Core insulation ===
This describes the method used to isolate the screening between individual cores; two approaches are common. The first method has an extruded plastic sheath around each individual core, making the multicore appear like a number of individual audio cables bundled together inside an outer sheath. The second method dispenses with the individual sheath and typically wraps the screening with very thin plastic; in some cases this plastic is bonded to the foil sheath.

The individually sheathed construction has the advantage that individually cores can easily be terminated to individual connectors at the ends of the cable. Its disadvantage is that the size and weight of the cable are increased. When a cable without individual sheaths has to be terminated to multiple connectors, it is common practice to create individual sheaths using heat-shrinkable tubing.

=== Overall screening ===
A small number of multicore cables compromise twisted-pairs with only an overall screen. These are virtually obsolete and typically only found in older broadcast installations; the use of individual screens is now virtually standard. Some multicore cables do contain an overall braid screen in addition to the individual screens on each core. This also increases the mechanical durability of the cable.

=== Overall insulation ===
Multicore cables usually have a thick PVC or cross-linked polyethylene sheath protecting the bundle of individual cables. The PVC sheath is extruded around the inner cables, and solidifies to hold the cables in a tight group. This stops the cables from coming out of their tight braid (a phenomenon known as &quot;corkscrewing&quot;), and absorbs mechanical stress such as a person stepping on the cable. A typical 48 channel multicore has an outside diameter of .

=== Core identification ===
Different cable manufacturers use different methods of identification for the shielded pairs of cable. Belden have a sequenced color code and a number for each of the conductors in their products of up to 52 pair cables; for their plenum cables each pair is covered with their patented Beldfoil shield that is only conductive on the inner surface. For their portable cables they use a French braid. Canare, Mogami, Clark Wire &amp; Cable and GEPCO mark numbers on the PVC insulation of the individual pairs.

== Digital alternatives ==

Whilst traditional analog multicore cables are common in sound engineering, the advent of digital mixing consoles have made so-called &quot;digital multicores&quot; favorable for many scenarios where multiple signals need to be run a long distance. Whilst not technically a multicore cable, this newer system performs the same function, but comprises a digital stage box connected directly to a mixing console through a single twisted pair or fiber-optic cable. The stage box converts between analog and digital signals with DA and AD converters.

This has the advantage of being much easier to set up and move, since only a single small cable needs to be run. Digital audio signals are also virtually insusceptible to electromagnetic interference, which is a great advantage in some applications such as long cable runs. Sometimes the only cable run between the stage and sound desk is a single digital cable, and all audio processing occurs in digital format at the mixing console and stage box.

Common protocols used for digital multicores include audio over Ethernet and AES10 (MADI).

<text>A de Laval nozzle (or convergent-divergent nozzle, CD nozzle or con-di nozzle) is a tube which is pinched in the middle, with a rapid convergence and gradual divergence. It is used to accelerate a compressible fluid to supersonic speeds in the axial (thrust) direction, by converting the thermal energy of the flow into kinetic energy. De Laval nozzles are widely used in some types of steam turbines and rocket engine nozzles. It also sees use in supersonic jet engines.

Similar flow properties have been applied to jet streams within astrophysics.

==History==

Giovanni Battista Venturi designed converging-diverging tubes known as Venturi tubes for experiments on fluid pressure reduction effects when fluid flows through chokes (Venturi effect). German engineer and inventor Ernst Körting supposedly switched to a converging-diverging nozzle in his steam jet pumps by 1878 after using convergent nozzles but these nozzles remained a company secret. Later, Swedish engineer Gustaf de Laval applied his own converging diverging nozzle design for use on his impulse turbine in the year 1888.

Laval&#x27;s convergent-divergent nozzle was first applied in a rocket engine by Robert Goddard. Most modern rocket engines that employ hot gas combustion use de Laval nozzles.

==Operation==

Its operation relies on the different properties of gases flowing at subsonic, sonic, and supersonic speeds. The speed of a subsonic flow of gas will increase if the pipe carrying it narrows because the mass flow rate is constant. The gas flow through a de Laval nozzle is isentropic (gas entropy is nearly constant). In a subsonic flow, sound will propagate through the gas. At the &quot;throat&quot;, where the cross-sectional area is at its minimum, the gas velocity locally becomes sonic (Mach number = 1.0), a condition called choked flow. As the nozzle cross-sectional area increases, the gas begins to expand, and the flow increases to supersonic velocities, where a sound wave will not propagate backward through the gas as viewed in the frame of reference of the nozzle (Mach number &gt; 1.0).

==Conditions for operation==

A de Laval nozzle will choke at the throat only if the pressure and mass flow through the nozzle is sufficient to reach sonic speeds; otherwise no supersonic flow is achieved, and it will act as a Venturi tube. This requires the entry pressure to the nozzle to be significantly above ambient at all times (equivalently, the stagnation pressure of the jet must be above ambient).

In addition, the pressure of the gas at the exit of the expansion portion of the exhaust of a nozzle must not be too low. Because pressure cannot travel upstream through the supersonic flow, the exit pressure can be significantly below the ambient pressure into which it exhausts, but if it is too far below ambient, then the flow will cease to be supersonic, or the flow will separate within the expansion portion of the nozzle, forming an unstable jet that may &quot;flop&quot; around within the nozzle, producing a lateral thrust and possibly damaging it.

In practice, ambient pressure must be no higher than roughly 2–3 times the pressure in the supersonic gas at the exit for supersonic flow to leave the nozzle.

==Analysis of gas flow in de Laval nozzles==

The analysis of gas flow through de Laval nozzles involves a number of concepts and assumptions:

* For simplicity, the gas is assumed to be an ideal gas.
* The gas flow is isentropic (i.e., at constant entropy). As a result, the flow is reversible (frictionless and no dissipative losses), and adiabatic (i.e., no heat enters or leaves the system).
* The gas flow is constant (i.e., in steady state) during the period of the propellant burn.
* The gas flow is along a straight line from gas inlet to exhaust gas exit (i.e., along the nozzle&#x27;s axis of symmetry)
* The gas flow behaviour is compressible since the flow is at very high velocities (Mach number &gt; 0.3).

==Exhaust gas velocity==

As the gas enters a nozzle, it is moving at subsonic velocities. As the cross-sectional area contracts, the gas is forced to accelerate until the axial velocity becomes sonic at the nozzle throat, where the cross-sectional area is the smallest. From there the throat the cross-sectional area then increases, allowing the gas to expand and the axial velocity to become progressively more supersonic.

The linear velocity of the exiting exhaust gases can be calculated using the following equation:

:formula_1

Some typical values of the exhaust gas velocity &quot;v&quot;e for rocket engines burning various propellants are:

* 1,700 to 2,900 m/s (3,800 to 6,500 mph) for liquid monopropellants,
* 2,900 to 4,500 m/s (6,500 to 10,100 mph) for liquid bipropellants,
* 2,100 to 3,200 m/s (4,700 to 7,200 mph) for solid propellants.

As a note of interest, &quot;v&quot;e is sometimes referred to as the &quot;ideal exhaust gas velocity&quot; because it is based on the assumption that the exhaust gas behaves as an ideal gas.

As an example calculation using the above equation, assume that the propellant combustion gases are: at an absolute pressure entering the nozzle &quot;p&quot; = 7.0 MPa and exit the rocket exhaust at an absolute pressure &quot;p&quot;e = 0.1 MPa; at an absolute temperature of &quot;T&quot; = 3500 K; with an isentropic expansion factor &quot;γ&quot; = 1.22 and a molar mass &quot;M&quot; = 22 kg/kmol. Using those values in the above equation yields an exhaust velocity &quot;v&quot;e = 2802 m/s, or 2.80 km/s, which is consistent with above typical values.

Technical literature often interchanges without note the universal gas law constant &quot;R&quot;, which applies to any ideal gas, with the gas law constant &quot;Rs&quot;, which applies only to a specific individual gas of molar mass &quot;M&quot;. The relationship between the two constants is &quot;Rs&quot; = &quot;R/M&quot;.

==Mass flow rate==
In accordance with conservation of mass the mass flow rate of the gas throughout the nozzle is the same regardless of the cross-sectional area.

formula_2

When the throat is at sonic speed Ma = 1 where the equation simplifies to:

formula_3

By Newton&#x27;s third law of motion the mass flow rate can be used to determine the force exerted by the expelled gas by:

formula_4


In aerodynamics, the force exerted by the nozzle is defined as the thrust.

<doc id="452494" wikidata="Q1967985" url="?curid=452494" title="Wheellock">
<text>A wheellock, wheel-lock, or wheel lock is a friction-wheel mechanism which creates a spark that causes a firearm to fire. It was the next major development in firearms technology after the matchlock, and the first self-igniting firearm. Its name is from its rotating steel wheel to provide ignition. Developed in Europe around 1500, it was used alongside the matchlock (), the snaplock (), the snaphance (), and the flintlock ().

==Design==
The wheellock works by spinning a spring-loaded steel wheel against a piece of pyrite to generate intense sparks, which ignite gunpowder in a pan, which flashes through a small touchhole to ignite the main charge in the firearm&#x27;s barrel. The pyrite is clamped in vise jaws on a spring-loaded arm (or &#x27;dog&#x27;), which rests on the pan cover. When the trigger is pulled, the pan cover is opened, and the wheel is rotated, with the pyrite pressed into contact.

A close modern analogy of the wheellock mechanism is the operation of a lighter, where a toothed steel wheel is spun in contact with a piece of sparking material to ignite the liquid or gaseous fuel.

A wheellock firearm had the advantage that it could be instantly readied and fired even with one hand, in contrast to common matchlock firearms, which required a burning cord of slow match ready if the gun might be needed and demanded the operator&#x27;s full attention and two hands to operate. On the other hand, wheellock mechanisms were complex to make, making them relatively costly.

===The &quot;dog&quot;===
The &quot;dog&quot; is a spring-loaded arm pivoted on the outside of the lock plate. A sparking material, usually a small piece of iron pyrite, is clamped and held by vise-like jaws at the swinging end of the arm. The dog has two possible positions to which it can be pivoted by hand: a &quot;safe&quot; position, in which the dog is pushed towards the muzzle of the firearm, and an &quot;operating&quot; position, where the dog is pulled towards the operator so that the pyrite in its jaws can engage either the top of the pan cover (see below), or (in the absence of the pan cover) the edge of a steel wheel bearing longitudinal grooves around its circumference. Flint is not suitable as a sparking material in the wheellock because it is too hard and would quickly wear away the wheel grooves.

===The wheel===
The upper segment of the grooved wheel, made of hardened steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions in the base of the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrite. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits through a hole in the lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.

===The pan===
As in all muzzle-loading firearms (prior to the introduction of the percussion cap), the pan transmits the fire to the main charge of gunpowder inside the breech of the barrel, via a small hole (or &quot;vent&quot;) in the side of the breech, that gives on to the pan. The priming pan of all wheellocks is provided with a sliding cover that has two purposes, the first of which is to contain the priming powder and afford it some protection from the elements (the second is examined below, under &#x27;Operation&#x27;). The pan cover may be slid open and closed by hand, but it is also attached to an arm inside the lock plate, which is acted upon by the eccentric on the shaft of the wheel.

===The sear or trigger mechanism===
The trigger engages one arm of a &quot;z&quot;-shaped sear pivoting in its centre between two upstanding brackets riveted or brazed to the inside of the lockplate. The other arm of the sear passes through a hole in the lockplate, and engages in a blind hole on the inner side of the wheel, thus effectively locking it and preventing any rotation but only because of a secondary sear or wedge that is pressed under the rear arm of the sear—that is between the lockplate and the sear—when the forward part of it engages into the recess in the wheel. When the trigger is pulled, the secondary lever is withdrawn from its position and the strong pull of the mainspring pushes the unsupported main sear back into the lock and the wheel is free to rotate. The mechanism may seem overconstructed, but it prevents the trigger mechanism from working against the very powerful mainspring as it is the case with all vertical acting sears in flint and percussion locks or even modern firearms that still have cocks (revolvers).

===Preparing to fire===
First, the dog is rotated forward to the &quot;safe&quot; position, and the priming pan is pushed open (if it is not already so). After loading a powder charge and ball through the muzzle in the usual way, the operator takes his &quot;spanner&quot;, slips it onto the square section of the wheel shaft, and turns it until a click is heard (about one-half to three-quarters of a revolution), and the wheel is felt to lock in place, whereupon the spanner is withdrawn. What occurs is that when the wheel is turned, the mainspring is tensioned via the chain, which is wound partially around the shaft. The click is the sound of one end of the sear engaging in the blind hole on the inside of the wheel, thus immobilising it.

The pan is then primed with powder, and the pan cover pulled shut. Finally the dog is pulled back so that the pyrite in its jaws is resting on the top of the pan cover, under some pressure from the spring at the toe of its arm.

===Operation===

On pulling the trigger of a wheellock firearm, the sear effects a slight rotation as described above. The end of the sear arm (that has hitherto locked the wheel and prevented it from turning) is disengaged, leaving the wheel free to turn under the tension of the mainspring. There is a subtlety here that is of vital importance: the &quot;hole&quot; in the side of the wheel into which the sear engages, is not a parallel-sided shaft. If it were, then under the tremendous tension of the mainspring, it would require a huge force on the trigger to disengage the sear. Nor is the tip of the sear arm cylindrical, which would have a similar effect. Rather, the &quot;hole&quot; is a depression in the wheel (like a small crater), and the sear has a rounded end: the wheel is locked by reason of lateral force on the shaft of the wheel rather than vertical force on the sear.

As soon as the wheel is released by the sear, the longer arm of the mainspring pulls the chain engaged in it. The other end of the chain being fixed to the cam on the wheel shaft, the latter rotates at high speed, whilst the rotating cam pushes forward the arm to which the pan cover is attached, thus causing the pan cover to slide forward towards the muzzle of the piece, and the pyrites to fall (under tension of the dog spring) on to the now rotating wheel. That is the second purpose of a sliding pan cover: were the pyrites to engage a stationary wheel, it would almost certainly jam the mechanism: but the built-in delay allows the pyrites to slip off the sliding pan-cover on to an already rotating wheel. A more modern development has been the use of a ball bearing between the wheel and the sear. This design allows a smoother and lighter trigger pull, requiring less force to operate.

The fast rotation of the wheel against the pyrites produces white-hot sparks that ignite the powder in the pan, which is transferred to the main charge in the breech of the barrel via the vent, and the gun discharges.

The wheellock took around a minute to load, prepare and fire. Many contemporary illustrations of a wheellock pistol in action show the gun held slightly rotated (about 45 degree angle from the horizontal) rather than vertically as with a hand cannon, to ensure that the priming powder in the pan lay against the vent in the barrel, and avoid a &#x27;flash in the pan&#x27; or misfire. This was not the case for the flintlock, where the sparks had to fall vertically a certain distance on to the pan.

==History==
Though not a firearm, a wheellock mechanism for a land mine is described in the &quot;Huolongjing&quot;, a 14th century Chinese military manual. When stepped on, a pin is dislodged, causing a weight to fall, which spun a drum attached to two steel wheels. The wheels struck sparks against a flint, igniting the fuse.

The invention of the wheellock in Europe can be placed at about 1500. There is a vocal group of scholars who believe Leonardo da Vinci was the inventor. Drawings made by Leonardo of a wheellock mechanism date (depending on the authority) from either the mid-1490s or the first decade of the 16th century. However, a drawing from a book of German inventions (dated 1505) and a 1507 reference to the purchase of a wheellock in Austria may indicate the inventor was an unknown German mechanic instead.

In 1517 and 1518, the first gun control laws banning the wheellock were proclaimed by the Emperor Maximilian I, initially in Austria and later throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Several Italian states followed suit in the 1520s and 1530s, another argument used by the pro-German camp.

As Lisa Jardine relates in her account of the assassination of William the Silent of the Netherlands, in 1584, the small size, ease of concealment and user-friendly loading aspect of the wheellock, compared to larger and more cumbersome hand-held weapons, meant that it was used for the killing of public figures, such as Francis, Duke of Guise and William himself. Jardine also argues that a stray wheellock pistol shot may have been responsible for the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre of French Huguenots in 1572.

Wheellock pistols were in common use during the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) on both sides for cavalry and officers. Around 1650 the flintlock began to replace the wheellock as it was cheaper and easier to use than the wheellock.

Wheel-lock firearms were never mass-produced for military purposes, but the best preserved armoury collection at the Landeszeughaus in Graz, Austria, contains over 3,000 examples, many of which were produced in small batches for military units.

==Features==
Among the advantages of the wheellock was a better resistance to rain or damp conditions than the matchlock and the absence of a telltale glow, or smell from the burning slow match, itself a hazard in proximity to gunpowder. A slow match could be next to impossible to light in rain, but the wheellock allowed sparks to be generated in any weather, and the priming pan was fitted with a cover that was not opened until the instant the gun was fired. That made it feasible for the first time to conceal a firearm under clothing. The high production cost and complexity of the mechanism, however, hindered the wheellock&#x27;s widespread adoption. A highly skilled gunsmith was required to build the mechanism, and the variety of parts and complex design made it liable to malfunction if it was not carefully maintained. Early models also had trouble with unreliable springs, but the problem was quickly solved.

The wheellock was used along with the matchlock until both were replaced by the simpler and less-costly flintlock, by the late 17th century. The wheellock mechanism however gave faster ignition than the flintlock, because the sparks were produced directly in the pan rather than having to fall a certain distance from the frizzen.

<text>Attack Squadron 176 (VA-176), known as the &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, was a United States Navy carrier-based medium attack squadron that saw combat service in the Vietnam War and later in 1983 in both Grenada and Lebanon.

==History==
VA-176 was established on 4 June 1955 and equipped with the Douglas AD-6 &quot;Skyraider&quot; and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. A year later the first deployment followed on board the aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean Sea as part of Air Task Group 2 (ATG-2). In 1958, the squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Group 17 (CVG-17), but was not deployed as CVG-17 was disbanded. The next cruise in 1959/60 was aboard the as part of CVG-10. In November and December 1960 VA-176 was assigned to Carrier Anti-submarine Air Group 52 (CVSG-52) aboard the . After this short deployment VA-176 returned to CVW-10 and made three deployments to the Mediterranean Sea with the between 1961 and 1965.

CVW-10 was shifted in 1966 to the , which was used as an attack carrier for three deployments to Vietnam. During the 1966 deployment two members of the squadron became known by successfully engaging a Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force MiG-17, an unusual instance of propeller-driven aircraft defeating a jet-powered adversary. 
In 1967 VA-176 was back in the Mediterranean Sea aboard the as part of CVW-3.

This was the last cruise with the Douglas A-1H &quot;Skyraider&quot;, as the squadron converted to the Grumman A-6A &quot;Intruder&quot; all-weather attack plane. From its first deployment with the &quot;Intruder&quot; in 1970 to the last in 1991, VA-176 was assigned to CVW-6. From 1970 to 1975, CVW-6 was assigned to the . The next three years were spent aboard the . In 1979 the wing moved to the , followed by the from 1986 to 1991. Flying the &quot;Intruder&quot;, VA-176 made eighteen deployments to the Mediterranean Sea, three of which also led to the Indian Ocean. The squadron earned three consecutive Battle &quot;E&quot; awards, for the years 1988-1991. The squadron was decommissioned from active service on 30 October 1992.

<doc id="452496" wikidata="Q139907" url="?curid=452496" title="Manawatū-Whanganui">
<text>Manawatū-Whanganui (; spelled Manawatu-Wanganui prior to 2019) is a region in the lower half of the North Island of New Zealand, whose main population centres are the cities of Palmerston North and Whanganui. It is administered by the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council, which operates under the name Horizons Regional Council.

== Name ==
The region takes its name from the two major rivers flowing through it: the Manawatū River and the Whanganui River.

In the Māori language, the name is a compound word that originates from an old Māori waiata (song). The waiata describes the search by an early ancestor, Haunui-a-Nanaia, for his wife, during which he named various waterways in the district, and says that his heart () settled or momentarily stopped () when he saw the Manawatu River.

&quot;Whanga nui&quot; is a phrase meaning &quot;big bay&quot; or &quot;big harbour&quot;. The first name of the European settlement at Whanganui was &quot;Petre&quot; (pronounced Peter), after Lord Petre, an officer of the New Zealand Company, but the name was never popular and was officially changed to &quot;Wanganui&quot; in 1854. In the local dialect, Māori pronounce the &quot;wh&quot; in Whanganui as , a voiced labial–velar approximant combined with a glottal stop, but to non-locals the name sounds like &quot;Wanganui&quot; and is hard to reproduce.

In 1991 the New Zealand Geographic Board considered demands from some local Māori to change the name of the river to Whanganui. After widespread controversy for many years, in September 2019 the New Zealand Geographic Board announced that from 18 October 2019 the name of the Manawatu-Wanganui region, and the regional council, would incorporate both the letter &quot;h&quot; and a macron, becoming &quot;Manawatū-Whanganui&quot;. This became the official spelling of the name on 18 October, although the Manawatū-Whanganui Regional Council would continue to use the trading name of Horizons Regional Council.

See: Controversy over Wanganui/Whanganui spelling.

== Government ==
The region covers all or part of ten territorial authority areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other regions of New Zealand, the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are Ruapehu, the major parts of Tararua District and Rangitikei, Manawatū, Whanganui, Horowhenua, and small parts of Stratford, Waitomo, and Taupō. The largest city is Palmerston North, with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.

The governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatū-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.

==Geography==
The region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the Whanganui and the Manawatu. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early Māori as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of Māori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui iwi. Māori along the coast and lowland plains grew kumara and other crops. The Manawatū River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile Manawatū Plains in the west. The main city of Palmerston North is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.

To the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the Tararua District lies between the sources of the Manawatū River near Norsewood and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region to the north and the Wairarapa to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union.

The two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland Ruapehu, Rangitikei, and Whanganui remained more Māori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river&#x27;s commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local Māori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawatū-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the Massey Agricultural College in the 1920s.

Much of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and bush-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of timber. Saw milling and flax milling dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of sheep farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. Deforestation, burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with overgrazing, resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important agricultural area.

===Topography===
Manawatū-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling (8.1% of New Zealand&#x27;s land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from Cape Turnagain to Owhanga. It borders the Waikato, Taranaki, Hawke&#x27;s Bay and Wellington regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the volcanic plateau to the sea. The Pacific Ocean is the eastern boundary and the Ruahine Range forms a natural boundary with Hawke&#x27;s Bay.

The area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the Volcanic Plateau are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The Manawatū District has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded Manawatū Plains that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A block faulting system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatū River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatū River begins just inside the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the Tasman Sea. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the Manawatū Gorge) is a water gap through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The Whanganui District is more rugged, with canyon-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.

The region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the Tararua Range and the Ruahine Range and the three major active volcanoes of the North Island. Mount Ruapehu at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, Ngauruhoe 2,291 m and Tongariro 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.

Three major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (), Manawatū ()), and Rangitīkei (). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of Lake Taupō. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.

===Soil and climate===
Soils are productive with the addition of nitrogen fertiliser. In the Manawatū and Horowhenua districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with loess-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile alluvial and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and beef farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of pumice soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.

The region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. Chateau Tongariro experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between . Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is , while inland areas are considerably colder. Waiouru has a minimum mid-winter daily average of .

Rainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving , while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of .

===Conservation and parks===
The region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation&#x27;s conservation estate. Tongariro National Park is the largest park in the region () and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to Māori and were given to the nation by Te Heuheu Tukino IV, paramount chief of Ngati Tuwharetoa. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a World Heritage Site.

Whanganui National Park is slightly smaller () and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer skiing, tramping, jetboating and white-water rafting and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.

The regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as African feathergrass, goats rue and nodding thistle pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. Possums are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine tuberculosis. Eradication programmes also concentrate on rabbits, rooks and feral goats, while other exotic species such as Parma wallaby (&quot;Macropus parma&quot;), wasps, ferrets, stoats and weasels are a source of concern.

===Biodiversity===
The internationally recognised Ramsar estuarine wetlands site at Foxton Beach is of note as having one of the most diverse ranges of wetlands birds to be seen at any one place in New Zealand. A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter. The estuary is also a permanent home to 13 species of birds, six species of fish and four plants species, all of which are threatened. It regularly supports about one percent of the world population of wrybills.

==Economy==
The subnational gross domestic product (GDP) of Manawatū-Whanganui was estimated at NZ$11.60 billion in the year to March 2019, 3.8% of New Zealand&#x27;s national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was estimated at $46,764 in the same period. In the year to March 2018, primary industries contributed $1.26 billion (11.5%) to the regional GDP, goods-producing industries contributed $2.01 billion (18.3%), service industries contributed $6.76 billion (61.6%), and taxes and duties contributed $942 million (8.6%).

Agriculture dominates the economy. A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time
equivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).

===Agriculture===
The region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, Canterbury and the Manawatū. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the Drysdale and the Perendale, which became commercially significant after World War II.

Agriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and horticulture. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawatū, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.

The region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, Southland and Otago. Barley, which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995.

The region has of horticultural land, of which 3,647 hectares are used for vegetable growing. While only having 8% of the country&#x27;s 45,000-hectare vegetable-growing land, the Manawatū-Whanganui region grows 26% of New Zealand&#x27;s asparagus, 20% of its lettuce, 19% of its brassicas (broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower), and 10% of its carrots and potatoes.

===Forestry===
The region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawatū since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region&#x27;s initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.

===Energy===
Unlike its neighbour Taranaki, Manawatū-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere&#x27;s largest collection of wind farms, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.

=== Government and defence ===
The New Zealand Defence Force maintains three bases in the Manawatū-Whanganui region: Waiouru Military Camp in the Ruapehu district, RNZAF Base Ohakea near Bulls, and Linton Military Camp near Palmerston North.

===Tourism===
For the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke&#x27;s Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.

===Museums===
Key cultural institutions in the region include Te Manawa in Palmerston North, the Whanganui Regional Museum, the Sarjeant Gallery and the Quartz Museum of Studio Ceramics in Whanganui, the National Army Museum in Waiouru, and the multi-cultural Te Awahou Nieuwe Stroom in Foxton.

===Transport===
State Highway 1, the main highway, and the North Island Main Trunk railway, which both link Auckland and Wellington, run through the region. The Palmerston North–Gisborne Line and State Highway 3 follow the Manawatū Gorge, linking the region with Hawke&#x27;s Bay. The Marton–New Plymouth Line provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short Wanganui Branch runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region&#x27;s exporters easy access to ports.

The region has approximately 16% of the North Island&#x27;s road length. There are of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.

<text>Andrija Maurović (; 29 March 1901 – 2 September 1981) was a comic book illustrator, comic book author, and artist. He is known for his &quot;Stari Mačak&quot; (Old Mickey, Old Tom-cat) series, which eventually became his nickname, and is often called the father of Croatian and Yugoslav comics.

Maurović was born in Muo near Kotor in the Kingdom of Dalmatia (present-day Montenegro) to a family of Slovene-Montenegrin origin. He enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb, and subsequently pursued a career as an illustrator and comic book creator for local publications. Along with other writers and artists, he founded the magazine &quot;Mickey Strip&quot; in 1937, where much of his work was serialized. His realistic and rough style utilizes black-and-white contrasts and a dynamic flow through the use of perspectives.

==Biography==

Maurović was born in the village of Muo (part of Kotor) in the Boka Kotorska in present-day Montenegro (at the time in Austria-Hungary), to a Slovene father (spelled Maurowitch)) and a Croat mother from the Boka Kotorska. After a short stay in Kraków, Poland, he and his family moved to Dubrovnik, near his birthplace, where he attended elementary and secondary school.

Following the recommendation of the writer Ivo Vojnović, Andrija Maurović enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb. At that time, he began illustrating books, weekly and daily newspapers, and working for graphic institutions, booksellers and editors, such as St. Kugli. He came into conflict with the academy&#x27;s rules, which prevented students from working during their studies. He left the Academy of Fine Arts during his first academic year to focus on his professional work creating illustrations, caricatures, posters, and graphic design. Andrija Maurović&#x27;s works appeared in publications such as &quot;Jutarnji list&quot;, &quot;Novosti&quot;, &quot;Koprive&quot;, &quot;Ženski svijet&quot;, and &quot;Kulisa&quot;.

In 1935, he created his first comic, &quot;Vjerenica Mača&quot; (The Sword&#x27;s Fiancée), which was published in the Zagreb newspaper Novosti. In the same year, Maurović co-launched &quot;Oko&quot;, the first Yugoslav comics magazine.

Maurović also collaborated with Croatian authors and screenplay writers, such as Franjo Fuis. He based his illustrations on literary models such as Alex Tolstoy, Zane Grey, August Šenoa, Jack London, B. Traven, Max Brand, and H. G. Wells.

Maurović designed socialist realist posters. He also painted seascapes and apocalyptic scenes, and worked as a caricaturist, illustrator, and preacher. At a time when pornography was mostly absent from mainstream media, Maurović published a series of drawings alluding to extramarital and marital relations. He also created a number of comic strip heroes and personalities such as &quot;Dan&quot;, &quot;Old Tom-cat&quot;, and &quot;Radoslav&quot;. His works are part of the Sudac Collection.

In the 1960s, a redesigned version of the Dubrovnik chess set by Andrija Maurović was created and produced in the workshop of Jakopović in Zagreb. Changes in the set&#x27;s redesign can be observed in the knights, with simplified carving, and the queens, having only five cuts in the crown as opposed to the original eleven. Bobby Fischer was often filmed and photographed with his own 1970 Dubrovnik chess set, which was later stolen.

Towards the end of his life, he &quot;gave up working on mainstream comics and turned to an ascetic lifestyle that excluded running water and electricity, painting large oil paintings with apocalyptic motifs and hardcore porn comics for his own pleasure&quot;. For Maurović, candaulism was said to be &quot;not an individual excess but an obsession that preoccupies all his pornographic comics. Only the men to which the husband exposes his wife differ – but it is desirable that they should be as ugly, wild, dirty, proscribed, and socially unacceptable as possible, to make the transgression even greater and the humiliation even more powerful. This further emphasizes the power of the sexual instinct that drives the actors and crushes prohibition.&quot;

Maurović died in Zagreb and was buried in the Mirogoj Cemetery. It is speculated that Maurović&#x27;s comic heroes promoted the victory of justice and freedom, and that Maurović lived by this ideology as well.
==&quot;Stari Mačak&quot;==
Maurović began his best-known series, centered around the character Stari Mačak (Old Tom-cat), in 1937. The series and its characters were created in collaboration with journalist Franjo Fuis, who, detesting adaptations, opted instead for an original series. The character &quot;Stari Mačak&quot; was first introduced in &quot;Gospodar Zlatnih Bregova&quot; (Master of the Golden Hills, January 1937) as an elderly wanderer who lost his memories after a tragic accident. The work was first serialized in the magazine &quot;Novosti&quot;, and subsequently in the comics magazine &quot;Mickey Strip&quot; under the name &quot;Crni Jahač&quot; (Dark Rider, 1938). He is not a typical Western hero, as Maurović sought inspiration from his daily acquaintances, basing Stari Mačak on a construction worker he frequently met at a pub on Ilica street.

This was quickly followed by &quot;Sablast Zelenih Močvara&quot; (Spook of the Green Swamps), where Stari Mačak was joined by wandering poet &quot;Polagana Smrt&quot; (Slow Death) along with his parrot Penelope and his horse Tulip. &quot;Posljednja pustolovina Starog Mačka&quot; (Old Cat&#x27;s Last Adventure) was published in volumes from November 1 to December 27, 1937.

==Legacy==
Comic book historians Zdravko Zupan and Slavko Draginčić praised Maurović for his ability to develop visual dynamics, with particular emphasis on black and white contrasting. Art historian Vera Horvat Pintarić wrote about his Interwar Period comic book work:
Timothy O. Benson described him as a superb master of the art of cartoon, stating that &quot;intensified interest in mass communications have resulted in reconsideration of his entire oeuvre&quot;. Maurović ignored global trends of comics in the 30s, creating his own distinct style and utilizing a great variety of themes for his opus. This involved both the use of monochromatic sfumato and playing with perspectives and scenes. It is for these reasons that he is generally considered to be the father of comic books and illustration in the territories of the former Yugoslavia, and its most popular author.

Goran Sudžuka cited him as his main influence, praising him as &quot;A truly unique figure in the whole comic industry, not just in Croatia.&quot;. The comic strip club in Kotor bears his name.

<doc id="452505" wikidata="Q2117321" url="?curid=452505" title="Kishori Amonkar">
<text>Kishori Amonkar (10 April 1932 – 3 April 2017) was an Indian classical vocalist, belonging to the Jaipur &quot;gharana&quot;, or a community of musicians sharing a distinctive musical style. She is considered to be one of the foremost classical singers in India.

She was a performer of the classical genre &quot;khyal&quot; and the light classical genres &quot;thumri&quot; and &quot;bhajan&quot;. Amonkar trained under her mother, classical singer Mogubai Kurdikar also from the Jaipur &quot;gharana&quot;, but she experimented with a variety of vocal styles in her career.

==Career==
===Training===
Amonkar&#x27;s initial training in music was by her mother, the classical vocalist Mogubai Kurdikar. She has stated in an interview that her mother was an exacting teacher, initially teaching her by singing phrases and making Amonkar repeat them. In the early stages of her career, she travelled with her mother to performances, accompanying her on the tanpura while Kurdikar sang.

In the early 1940s, young Amonkar began to receive vocal lessons in Hindustani classical music from Anjanibai Malpekar of the Bhendibazaar gharana and later received training from tutors of several other &quot;gharanas&quot;. Her tutors included Anwar Hussain Khan of Agra gharana, Sharadchandra Arolkar of Gwalior gharana, and Balkrishnabuwa Parwatkar. Amonkar has credited Anjanibai, in particular, with teaching her the technique of &quot;meend&quot;, or gliding, between notes.

===Technique and style===
Amonkar&#x27;s later work in light music reformed her classical singing and she modified her Jaipur &quot;gharana&quot; performance style by applying features from other &quot;gharanas&quot;. She has been both praised and criticised for pushing the boundaries of the Jaipur tradition. She was a romanticist and her approach prioritised emotional expression over tradition, so she often departed from the Jaipur gharana&#x27;s rhythmic, melodic, and structural traditions. Amonkar has criticised the idea that schools, or gharanas, of music determine or constrain a singer&#x27;s technique. Amonkar has stated that while the Jaipur gharana&#x27;s technique and methods form the base of her style, she performs several variations on it, including an adoption of &quot;alapchaari&quot;, or a relaxing of the link between the rhythm and note.

Amonkar has expressed her views on how musical education should be conducted, emphasising the importance of enabling students to move beyond repetitive techniques and learn the tools that allow them to improvise on their own. She credits her mother with using this approach to teach her, noting, &quot;You have to walk and run on your own. The guru gives you strength to be able to do that. If you don&#x27;t, then you remain ordinary. My mother made sure I wasn&#x27;t ordinary.&quot; She noted that training is an ongoing process, and stated in an interview that she often listened to her own recorded performances to analyse and improve her technique.

Amonkar emphasised emotion and spirituality as essential parts of her singing, stating that &quot;To me it (music) is a dialogue with the divine, this intense focused communication with the ultimate other.&quot; She has often spoken of music as an act of sublimation, noting that it is the &quot;sadhana&quot; (medium) to attain the &quot;sadhya&quot; (destination).

In 2010, she published a book in Marathi titled &quot;Swaraartha Ramani&quot; in which she elaborated her views on musical theory and practice.

===Classical vocalist===
Amonkar&#x27;s career as a classical vocalist grew in the 1960s and 70s. Prior to this, she briefly stopped performing because of an illness that affected her ability to sing. Amonkar has said that she used this hiatus in her career to consider and develop her own style of singing, that transcended classical schools (&quot;gharanas&quot;) of music.

Amonkar has also spoken about the treatment of women performers as classical musicians, noting that the experience of watching her mother perform informed her own approach to professionalism and fair treatment, particularly when it comes to ensuring that musicians are paid well for their performances. On one notable occasion, she refused to perform because the audience was badly behaved, emphasising the importance of respecting the performers during a concert.

She created many compositions for a number of ragas. Amonkar was also a popular speaker and travelled throughout India; she was best known for lectures on the role of &quot;rasa&quot; (feelings or emotions) in music.

===Light classical and popular genres===
In addition to her career as a classical vocalist, Amonkar was known for her performances of lighter classical pieces, with a wide repertoire of thumris and bhajans, as well as some performances for film soundtracks. She sang for the soundtrack of the 1990 Hindi film &quot;Drishti&quot;. She became interested in film music and sang playback for the 1964 movie &quot;Geet Gaya Patharon Ne and Drishti .&quot; She decided to stay away from film music further because she found it compromising on the swaras over the lyrics, the essential element of any genre of music. Also her mother Mogubai Kurdikar disapproved of working in film music; Kurdikar is reported to have told Amonkar that she would be forbidden from touching her mother&#x27;s tanpura if she would continue to work in the film industry.

==Personal life and death==
Kishori Amonkar was born in Bombay on 10 April 1932. Her father died when she was 7 years old, leaving Amonkar and her two younger siblings to be raised primarily by their mother, the classical vocalist Mogubai Kurdikar.

Kishori was married to Ravindra Amonkar, a school teacher. The couple had two sons, Bibhas and Nihar, now both in their sixties. She was sometimes also described as &quot;temperamental&quot;. Responding to these comments, Amonkar has stated that this reputation perhaps derives from her insistence that performers be treated respectfully, and to the fact that she chooses to spend time before her concerts in solitude and preparation instead of socialising with fellow musicians. Amonkar has stated, &quot;I never play to the gallery. The audience cannot disturb the loneliness of an artiste.&quot; Amonkar did not enjoy giving press interviews.

Amonkar lived in the neighbourhood of Prabhadevi, in Mumbai. She died on 3 April 2017 in her sleep, at age 84, at her residence in Mumbai. That day, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, issued a statement on Twitter mourning her loss, writing: &quot;Demise of Kishori Amonkar is an irreparable loss to Indian classical music. Deeply pained by her demise. May her soul rest in peace.&quot;

==Recognition and legacy==
Amonkar received several of India&#x27;s national awards and civilian honours, including the Padma Bhushan, in 1987, and Padma Vibhushan in 2002. She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1985 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship for 2009. She was awarded the prestigious Dr. T. M. A. Pai Outstanding Konkani Award in 1991. In 2016, she was one of seven recipients of the M.S. Subbulakshmi Award for classical music.

Amonkar was recognised by several of her contemporaries and fellow musicians for her skill and technique in classical music. The tabla musician, Zakir Hussain, has said that Amonkar&#x27;s performances of several ragas, such as Raga Bhoop, are &quot;... landmark performances that take place over hundreds of years and you will talk about them for the rest of your life and rest of the many centuries to come.&quot; The Carnatic vocalist T.M. Krishna praised her approach to classical music, saying, &quot;When Kishoriji sings she is not trying to be new but just by being with her music and continuing to submit to it, she has given classical music an everlasting newness and freshness. This is true creativity.&quot;

<text>Stephan Micus (; born 19 January 1953) is a German musician and composer, whose musical style is heavily influenced by his study of traditional instruments and musical techniques from Japan, India, South America, and other countries. With the exception of his album &quot;The Music of Stones&quot; (1989), he plays all the instruments on his recordings, combining styles from different countries and using the instruments in unprecedented ways in each of his pieces. He often uses layers of a single instrument to create unusual combinations of sounds. He is one of the few ECM Records artists whose records are not produced by Manfred Eicher. He has mixed instruments from around the world, or used whatever was at hand: stones, ordinary flowerpots tuned with water, and his voice—singing improvised syllables over ten years before others made this approach fashionable.

Micus has played bagpipes, Japanese bamboo flute, rabab, steel drums, and zither.

<doc id="452528" wikidata="Q550115" url="?curid=452528" title="Anthony Montgomery">
<text>Anthony Dwayne Montgomery (born June 2, 1971) is an American actor and graphic novelist. He is best known for his portrayal of Ensign Travis Mayweather on the UPN science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (the fifth live-action series in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise). Montgomery played Andre Maddox on the ABC daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 2015 to 2019. He is the grandson of guitarist Wes Montgomery.

==Early life==
Montgomery was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He graduated from Ball State University with a degree in performance theater and drama. Montgomery did stand-up comedy briefly after graduation, before moving to California.

==Career==
===Film and television===
Sometimes credited as &quot;A.T. Montgomery&quot;, his first starring role was in the horror-comedy &quot;Leprechaun in the Hood&quot; (2000), for which he also contributed writing and vocals for several songs. He had a recurring role on the television series &quot;Popular&quot; before being cast in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; in 2001. In 2004, he returned to stand-up comedy.

Montgomery starred in the film &quot;I&#x27;m Through with White Girls&quot; in 2007. In January 2009, Montgomery appeared in an episode of the Fox series &quot;House&quot;. In 2013, he appeared briefly as a dud romantic-interest in the show &quot;Baby Daddy&quot; (season 2, ep. 1), playing a handsome but boring drycleaner the show&#x27;s (young) grandmother was interested in. In 2013 he also produced and starred in the independent film &quot;Chariot&quot;, about seven amnesiac strangers who awake on an airliner mid-flight.

In 2015, Montgomery joined the cast of the ABC daytime soap &quot;General Hospital&quot; playing Dr. Andre Maddox.

===Stage===
In 2004, Montgomery returned to the stage in Los Angeles, producing the show &quot;Dutchman&quot; by LeRoi Jones. He has also performed in a number of stage productions. His other stage credits include productions of &quot;Working&quot;, &quot;Oliver&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot;, and &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;. In the summer of 2005, Montgomery returned to Indiana to star in theatrical fundraisers for charity.

===Music===
Montgomery has produced one CD of his own music, &quot;What You Know About...&quot;, featuring four songs about &quot;Star Trek&quot; themes. In April 2007 Anthony Montgomery signed with the Germany-based AGR Television Records. His (Hip-Hop) debut-album, titled &quot;A.T.&quot;, was released in November 2008. In the TV series &quot;Single Ladies&quot; that he had a recurring role in, a single he wrote and performed, entitled &quot;Stimulation&quot;, was included for the music-heavy show&#x27;s mood soundtrack for Episode 9. The single also featured rapper J. Naught-T.

===Writing===
In 2013, Montgomery created &quot;Miles Away&quot;, a hoped-to-be media franchise, about a teenager with special needs who battles aliens. A graphic novel was published in June 2013.

==Personal life==
Anthony Montgomery and his wife Adrienne Montgomery were wed in August 2007. They have a son together (born 2010), and he has a daughter from a previous relationship. His grandfather was jazz musician Wes Montgomery. 
Montgomery is a martial arts student. He studied Hapkido and Koga Ryu Ninjutsu.

<text>The Territory of Montana was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 26, 1864, until November 8, 1889, when it was admitted as the 41st state in the Union as the state of Montana.

==Original boundaries==

The Montana Territory was organized out of the existing Idaho Territory by Act of Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on May 26, 1864. The areas east of the Continental Divide had been previously part of the Nebraska Territory and Dakota Territory and had been acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase.

The territory also included a portion of the Idaho Territory west of the continental divide and east of the Bitterroot Range, which had been acquired by the United States in the Oregon Treaty, and originally included in the Oregon Territory. The part of the Oregon Territory that became part of Montana had been split off as part of the Washington Territory.

The boundary between the Washington Territory and Dakota Territory was the Continental Divide (as shown on the 1861 map); however, the boundary between the Idaho Territory and the Montana Territory followed the Bitterroot Range north of 46°30′ north (as shown on the 1864 map). This change was due in part to Congress unifying the area with the creation of Idaho Territory in 1863, coupled with the subsequent political maneuvering of Sidney Edgerton, soon to be the first Territorial Governor of Montana, and his allies in the Congress. They successfully implemented the boundary change that won the Flathead and Bitterroot valleys for Montana Territory. The Organic Act of the Territory of Montana defines the boundary as extending from the modern intersection of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming at: 
The forty-fourth degree and thirty minutes of north latitude; thence due west along said forty-fourth degree and thirty minutes of north latitude to a point formed by its intersection with the crest of the Rocky Mountains; thence following the crest of the Rocky Mountains northward till its intersection with the Bitter Root Mountains; thence northward along the crest of the Bitter Root Mountains to its intersection with the thirty-ninth degree of longitude west from Washington; thence along said thirty-ninth degree of longitude northward to the boundary line of British possessions.

Upon the establishment of the Wyoming Territory in 1868, an enclave of Dakota Territory known as Lost Dakota was accidentally created. This error was overlooked by the federal government until 1873, when it was annexed and thereby incorporated into Gallatin County, Montana. The Montana Territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Montana on November 8, 1889.

==Government==
The act of Congress of 1864 creating Montana, known as the Organic Act, prescribed a somewhat standard organization for the territorial government of Montana. It established executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, however, the federal government held a dominant role in administering the new territory. Particularly, the Congress reserved the right to nullify any laws passed by the citizen-elected territorial legislature. The President of the United States appointed the most powerful positions in the territory, including a governor, secretary of the territory, and three members of the territorial supreme court, with the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate. The citizens of the territory elected a legislative assembly, consisting of a Council and House of Representatives, which together created the laws for the territory. Citizens also elected a lone delegate to Congress as strictly an advisor to the U.S. House of Representatives; a territorial delegate was not permitted to vote. The territorial government was meant to provide a training ground for a future move to statehood, allowing time for an area&#x27;s institutions to mature and populations to grow.

===Executive===

====Governor====
The governor served a four-year term, unless removed by the President. Duties of the office included 1) the faithful execution of the laws, 2) to serve as the commander-in-chief of the militia, and 3) to serve as the superintendent of Indian affairs. The governor also had to approve or veto laws within three days of passage by the territorial legislative assembly.

====Secretary of the territory====
The secretary of the territory served a four-year term, unless removed by the President. Duties of the office included 1) the recording of all laws and proceedings of the legislative assembly and the acts of the governor, 2) the transmission of copies of the laws and journals of the legislative assembly to the President and the leaders of Congress, and 3) the transmission of executive proceedings and correspondence twice a year to the President. Importantly, the secretary also served as acting governor in case of the death, removal, resignation, or absence of the governor from the territory.

Dem Democratic
Rep Republican
===Congressional delegation===
The eligible citizens of Montana Territory voted for a delegate to Congress, electing them to a two-year term. The territorial delegate had a seat in the House of Representatives and, as any other representative, participated in debates, yet they did not have the right to vote. During the time Montana was a territory, some delegates to Congress were allowed to sit on select committees and even standing committees of the House, yet as on the floor of the House, they were not permitted to vote.

<text>Athos is an album by Stephan Micus recorded between November 1993 – February 1994 and released on ECM in 1994.

== Background ==
Based on a three-day visit to Mount Athos, Micus tries to capture his experiences with the Greek Orthodox liturgy he experienced in the monasteries there, framing it with pieces that evoke his emotions at going to and leaving the isolated peninsula. Between them he recreates the liturgical experience of the services during his stay, in six alternating pieces of night and day.

As in his other works, Micus uses a combination of traditional instruments from various cultures to capture the feel of the monastery. These include: the &quot;sattar&quot; (a bowed 10-string instrument used by the Uyghur), the &quot;shakuhachi&quot; (a Japanese bamboo flute), the &quot;suling&quot; (a reed flute from Bali), the &quot;ney&quot; (a Middle Eastern flute), and 22 flowerpots, filled with water, which he plays with his hands and with mallets. These instruments are only used in the pieces representing the days on Mount Athos.

To emulate the Greek Orthodox tradition of not using musical instruments in their services, his pieces devoted to the nights are performed by a 22-man choir singing prayers to the Virgin Mary.

<text>Flatlands is a neighborhood in the southeast part of the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. The current neighborhood borders are roughly defined by the Bay Ridge Branch to the north, Avenue U to the south, Ralph Avenue to the east, and Flatbush Avenue to the southwest.

Originally an independent town, Flatlands became part of the City of Brooklyn in 1896.

Flatlands is part of Brooklyn Community District 18, and its primary ZIP Code is 11234. It is patrolled by the 63rd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 45th and 46th Districts.

==History==

Flatlands was originally known as Nieuw Amersfoort, after the Dutch city of Amersfoort, and was established as a farming community in 1636 when Wolfert Gerritse Van Couwenhoven and Andries Hudde purchased 15,000 acres of land centered on what is now the intersection of Kings Highway and Flatbush Avenue.

The land was ostensibly purchased from the Native Lenape people, who had lived near the fishing rich waters of Jamaica Bay for a thousand years. However, it is unlikely that the Lenape leaders, who did not practice the concept of land ownership, understood the agreement to which they were being conjoined. Rather, leaders such as Sachem Penhawitz more probably believed they were negotiating a treaty regarding the usage of the land. Wealthy Dutch land owners disagreed and within two generations, the once-powerful Canarsee tribe of the Lenape was brought to near extinction by bloody conflict with Europeans and other tribes, as well as the ravages of disease.

Flatlands was given the right to local rule in 1661 by Peter Stuyvesant as one of the five Dutch Towns on Long Island.

The town&#x27;s growth and development came late, largely due to the lack of a transit system or set of roads connecting it with other parts of Brooklyn. 
Flatlands was annexed by the city of Brooklyn in 1896. At the time, it contained numerous small islands on Jamaica Bay, including Mill Island, Bergen Island, and Barren Island.

=== Land use ===
Crops typically grown in the area were beans, corn, marsh hay, squash, potato bean and tobacco. Oysters and clams were also farmed and harvested from Jamaica Bay, surrounding marshes and basins. The land-controlling families of Nieuw Amersfoort also kept black slaves to work their farms until the state declared emancipation of all slaves in 1827, after which black laborers took up farming jobs, many times on the farms they worked on as slaves.

=== Historic buildings ===

Historic homes dated to the 18th century include the Stoothoff-Baxter-Kouwenhaven House and Joost Van Nuyse House.

Other historic structures are the Hendrick I. Lott House (East 36th Street between Fillmore Ave and Ave. S, built around 1720), which was a stop on the Underground Railroad, and the Flatlands Dutch Reformed Church, founded by Pieter Clausen Wycoff.

<text>Robert Michael O&#x27;Hare Jr. (May 6, 1952 – September 28, 2012) was an American actor who performed on stage and television. He was best known for playing the lead role of space station Commander Jeffrey Sinclair in the first season of the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Michael O&#x27;Hare Jr. was born in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in Chicago Heights. His father, Robert Michael O’Hare Sr., was of Irish descent while his mother, Sally O’Hare (née Crisanti) was of Italian descent. He attended Chicago&#x27;s Mendel Catholic Preparatory High School, where he played football, to defy his doctor who told him he would never be in athletics because of his asthma. He received several awards and scholarship offers based on his football ability and scholastic performance.

Coming from a career military family, he considered joining the US Navy or having a career in professional football but attended Harvard University, where he studied English literature and played on the Harvard Crimson football team. He joined the university&#x27;s drama groups and was a performer in “The Wrongway Inn”, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ production for 1972. That same year, he went for an &quot;acting tryout&quot; to the New York area, and was cast as Beef Saunders in &quot;Good News!&quot; at Goodspeed Musicals. He was a member of the Harvard Glee Club during its 1973 World Tour. He left Harvard in 1974 to study at the Juilliard School of Drama. He later took lessons from Sanford Meisner in the mid-1980s.

==Career==
O&#x27;Hare appeared in a number of theatrical productions on Broadway and in regional theaters, including an acclaimed revival of Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Man and Superman&quot; with Philip Bosco; in the role of Col. Jessup in the original stage version of &quot;A Few Good Men;&quot; as Captain Solyony in Chekhov’s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;. Other notable roles included Alfred in a 1986 stage revival of &quot;Little Murders&quot;; Jake in &quot;A Lie of the Mind&quot; and John in &quot;Lips Together, Teeth Apart&quot;.

He was the first white actor nominated by the African-American theater community of New York for the AUDELCO Award for Best Actor, for his performance as Captain Jaap van Tonder in Michael Picardie&#x27;s play &quot;Shades of Brown&quot;, about apartheid in South Africa.

He co-starred in the biographical TV movie &quot;Marciano&quot; and an unsold TV pilot &quot;Keefer&quot; with William Conrad in the late 1970s. In the 1980s, he appeared mainly as guest on a range of television shows, including &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;; &quot;T.J. Hooker&quot;; &quot;Kate &amp; Allie&quot;; &quot;The Equalizer&quot;; &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;; and &quot;Rage of Angels: The Story Continues&quot;.

He was the lead character in Michael Lengsfield&#x27;s CINE-award-winning short film &quot;Short Term Bonds&quot; in 1988, screened at the 1989 Sundance festival.

In 1992, he was cast in the lead role of Commander Jeffrey Sinclair in the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. He appeared in the pilot and throughout the show&#x27;s first season in 1994. He left the cast for mental health reasons that were not disclosed at the time, but made guest appearances in the second and third seasons.

Subsequently, he had one guest role on &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot; and appeared twice on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, the last time in 2000. He did some voiceover work for commercials and read a radio adaptation of the science fiction novella &quot;Think Like a Dinosaur&quot; for Seeing Ear Theater.

After 2000, he retired from acting and rarely made public appearances.

==Illness and death==
&quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski revealed after O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s death that the actor had had severe mental illness. During the filming of the first season of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, O&#x27;Hare began having paranoid delusions, and, halfway through, his hallucinations worsened. It became increasingly difficult for O&#x27;Hare to continue working, his behavior was becoming increasingly erratic, and he was often at odds with his colleagues. Straczynski offered to suspend production for several months to accommodate treatment; however, O&#x27;Hare feared that such a hiatus would put the series at risk, and he did not want to jeopardize others&#x27; jobs. Straczynski agreed to keep O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s condition secret to protect his career, and O&#x27;Hare agreed to complete the first season, but would be written out of the second season so that he could seek treatment. His departure from the cast was announced without explanation, except that it was mutual and amicable.

His treatments were only partially successful. He reappeared in a cameo appearance early in season two (&quot;The Coming of Shadows&quot;) and returned in season three for a two-part episode (&quot;War Without End&quot;) which closed his character&#x27;s story arc. At that time, Straczynski promised O&#x27;Hare to keep his condition secret &quot;to my grave&quot;. O&#x27;Hare told him to instead &quot;keep the secret to &quot;my&quot; grave&quot;, arguing that fans deserved to eventually learn the real reason for his departure, and that his experience could raise awareness and understanding for people with mental illness. He made no further appearances on &quot;Babylon 5,&quot; but continued to support the show and appeared at conventions and signing events until his retirement from public appearances in 2000.

On September 28, 2012, Straczynski posted that O&#x27;Hare had had a heart attack in New York City five days earlier, and had remained in a coma until his death that day. Eight months later, Straczynski revealed the circumstances of O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s departure from &quot;Babylon 5&quot; at a presentation about the series at the Phoenix Comicon.

<doc id="452557" wikidata="Q198895" url="?curid=452557" title="Prince Teimuraz of Georgia">
<text>Teimuraz Bagrationi (), otherwise known as [[Tsarevich]] Teimuraz Georgievich (; April 23, 1782 – October 25, 1846), was a Georgian royal prince (&quot;batonishvili&quot;) and scholar primarily known as an author of the first critical history in Georgian as well as for his work to popularize interest in the history and culture of Georgia and preserve its treasures.
==Biography==

Prince Teimuraz was born in Tbilisi to Heir Apparent George, subsequently the last king of Georgia (Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti) from 1798 to 1800, and his wife, Ketevan Andronikashvili. He studied at the Telavi Seminary, and, at the age of 13, took part in the 1795 Battle of Krtsanisi at which his grandfather, King Heraclius II of Georgia, was defeated by a Persian invading army under Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar. Teimuraz did not accept the Russian annexation of Georgia of 1801, which followed shortly after his father&#x27;s death and fled to Persia, whence his uncle, Alexander fought to expel the Russians from Georgia. During the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813), Teimuraz, who was known as Tahmures Mirza in Persia, served as a Persian artillery commander. On October 16, 1810, however, he surrendered to the Russian authorities. On January 12, 1811, he settled in St Petersburg where he was granted a state salary and pension. In 1813, he acquired a mansion on Vasilievsky Island and concentrated on scholarly work. He collected and researched old Georgian chronicles and analyzed Greco-Roman and Armenian sources on Georgia. He was a collaborator and friend of Marie Brosset, a French scholar, whom he frequently consulted on the history of Georgia. At the same time, Prince Teiumraz befriended and tutored the young Georgian students in St Petersburg – Platon Ioseliani, and David Chubinashvili – both of whom eventually became prolific Georgian historians.

In the 1830s-1840s, he composed two major works on the early history of Georgia – &quot;ისტორია დაწყებითგან ივერიისა, ესე იგი გიორგიისა, რომელ არს სრულიად საქართველოჲსა&quot; (1832, &quot;History of Iberia or Georgia, that is All of Sakartvelo&quot;) and &quot;ისტორია ძველი კოლხიდისა&quot; (1840, &quot;History of Ancient Colchis&quot;) – and wrote commentaries to the 12th-century Georgian national epic &quot;The Knight in the Panther&#x27;s Skin&quot; (&quot;განმარტება პოემა ვეფხისტყაოსანისა&quot;, 1843). His articles were published in the Paris-based Journal Asiatique and Memoires inedits. He was elected an honorary member of the French Societe Asiatique (1831), the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences (1837) and the Danish Royal Antiquarian Society (1838). Prince Teimuraz also authored several poems, and a memoir of his European travels as well as the Georgian translations of Tacitus, Voltaire, and Pushkin.

He died in Saint Petersburg and was buried there at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra.

<doc id="452558" wikidata="Q335368" url="?curid=452558" title="Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond">
<text>Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond, (&quot;né&quot; Lennox; 3 August 179121 October 1860), styled the Earl of March from 1806–19, was a Scottish peer, soldier and prominent Conservative politician. Upon the death of his uncle in 1836, he inherited the Gordon estates and per the terms of the bequest, adopted thus additional surname. His near-complete correspondence is now held at the West Sussex Archives.

==Origins==
Gordon-Lennox was born in 1791, the son and heir of Charles Lennox (1764–1819) by his wife, Lady Charlotte Gordon, the eldest child of Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. In 1806, his father inherited the Dukedom of Richmond from his uncle the third duke. From then until his father&#x27;s death in 1819, Gordon-Lennox was styled Earl of March, a courtesy title, being one of his father&#x27;s subsidiary titles.

In 1836, on inheriting the estates of his childless maternal uncle George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon, he was required by the terms of the bequest to assume the surname of Gordon before that of Lennox; he duly took the surname Gordon-Lennox for himself and his issue, by royal licence dated 9 August 1836.

==Education==
Gordon-Lennox was educated at Westminster School in London and Trinity College, Dublin.

==Military career==

As Earl of March, he served on Wellington&#x27;s staff in the Peninsular War, during which time he volunteered to join the 52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot&#x27;s advance storming party on the fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo. He formally joined the 52nd Foot in 1813 and took command of a company of soldiers at the Battle of Orthez in 1814, where he was severely wounded; the musket-ball in his chest was never removed. During the Battle of Waterloo (1815) he was aide-de-camp to the Prince of Orange, and following the latter&#x27;s wounding, served as aide-de-camp to Wellington. He was chiefly responsible for the institution in 1847 of the Military General Service Medal for all survivors of the campaigns between 1793 and 1814, considered by many belated as hitherto there had only been a Waterloo Medal. He campaigned in Parliament and also enlisted the interest of Queen Victoria. Richmond himself received the medal with eight clasps.

On 19 October 1817, he reformed the Goodwood Troop of Yeomanry Artillery, originally raised by the 3rd Duke in 1797. The unit supported the cavalry of the Sussex Yeomanry but was disbanded in December 1827. Richmond was appointed Colonel of the Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia on 4 December 1819, and Colonel-in-Chief of its offshoot the Royal Sussex Militia Artillery, on its formation in April 1853.

==Political career==
Richmond sat as a Member of Parliament for Chichester between 1812 and 1819. The latter year he succeeded his father in the dukedom and entered the House of Lords where he was a vehement opponent of Roman Catholic emancipation, and later was a leader of the opposition to Peel&#x27;s free trade policy, as he was the president of the Central Agricultural Protection Society, which campaigned for the preservation of the Corn Laws. Although a vigorous Conservative and Ultra-Tory for most of his career, Richmond&#x27;s anger with Wellington over Catholic Emancipation prompted him to lead the Ultras into joining Earl Grey&#x27;s reforming Whig government in 1830 (Lang, 1999).

He served under Grey as Postmaster General between 1830 and 1834. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1830, and in 1831 was appointed to serve on the Government Commission upon Emigration, which was wound up in 1832.

Richmond was Lord Lieutenant of Sussex between 1835 and 1860 and was appointed a Knight of the Garter in 1829.

==Marriage and children==

On 10 April 1817 he married Lady Caroline Paget (1797 – March 1874), a daughter of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey by his wife Lady Caroline Villiers, by whom he had five sons and five daughters:

<text>A matchlock or firelock is a historical type of firearm wherein the gunpowder is ignited by a burning piece of flammable cord or twine that is in contact with the gunpowder through a mechanism that the musketeer activates by pulling a lever or trigger with their finger. This firing mechanism was an improvement over the hand cannon, which lacked a trigger and required the musketeer or an assistant to apply a match directly to the gunpowder by hand. The matchlock mechanism allowed the musketeer to apply the match himself without losing his concentration.

==Description==


The classic matchlock gun held a burning slow match in a clamp at the end of a small curved lever known as the &quot;serpentine&quot;. Upon the pull of a lever (or in later models a trigger) protruding from the bottom of the gun and connected to the serpentine, the clamp dropped down, lowering the smoldering match into the flash pan and igniting the priming powder. The flash from the primer traveled through the touch hole, igniting the main charge of propellant in the gun barrel. On the release of the lever or trigger, the spring-loaded serpentine would move in reverse to clear the pan. For obvious safety reasons, the match would be removed before reloading of the gun. Both ends of the match were usually kept alight in case one end should be accidentally extinguished.

Earlier types had only an S-shaped serpentine pinned to the stock either behind or in front of the flash pan (the so-called &quot;serpentine lock&quot;), one end of which was manipulated to bring the match into the pan.

A later addition to the gun was the rifled barrel. This made the gun much more accurate at longer distances but did have drawbacks, the main one being that it took much longer to reload because the bullet had to be pounded down into the barrel.

A type of matchlock was developed called the snap matchlock, in which the serpentine was brought to firing position by a weak spring, and activated by pressing a button, pulling a trigger, or even pulling a short string passing into the mechanism. As the match was often extinguished after its collision with the flash pan, this type was not used by soldiers but was often used in fine target weapons where the precision of the shot was more important than the repetition.

An inherent weakness of the matchlock was the necessity of keeping the match constantly lit. This was chiefly a problem in wet weather, when damp match cord was difficult to light and to keep burning. Another drawback was the burning match itself. At night, the match would glow in the darkness, possibly revealing the carrier&#x27;s position. The distinctive smell of burning match-cord was also a giveaway of a musketeer&#x27;s position. It was also quite dangerous when soldiers were carelessly handling large quantities of gunpowder (for example, while refilling their powder horns) with lit matches present. This was one reason why soldiers in charge of transporting and guarding ammunition were amongst the first to be issued self-igniting guns like the wheellock and snaphance.

The matchlock was also uneconomical to keep ready for long periods of time, as keeping both ends of a match lit every night for a year required a mile of match.
==History==

The earliest form of matchlock in Europe appeared by 1411 and in the Ottoman Empire by 1425. This early arquebus was a hand cannon with a serpentine lever to hold matches. However this early arquebus did not have the matchlock mechanism traditionally associated with the weapon. The exact dating of the matchlock addition is disputed. The first references to the use of what may have been matchlock arquebuses (&quot;tüfek&quot;) by the Janissary corps of the Ottoman Army date them from 1394 to 1465. However it is unclear whether these were arquebuses or small cannons as late as 1444, but according to Gábor Ágoston the fact that they were listed separately from cannons in mid-15th century inventories suggest they were handheld firearms, though he admits this is disputable. Godfrey Goodwin dates the first use of the matchlock arquebus by the Janissaries to no earlier than 1465. The idea of a serpentine later appeared in an Austrian manuscript dated to the mid-15th century. The first dated illustration of a matchlock mechanism dates to 1475, and by the 16th century they were universally used. During this time the latest tactic in using the matchlock was to line up and send off a volley of musket balls at the enemy. This volley would be much more effective than single soldiers trying to hit individual targets.

Robert Elgood theorizes the armies of the Italian states used the arquebus in the 15th century, but this may be a type of hand cannon, not matchlocks with trigger mechanism. He agreed that the matchlock first appeared in Western Europe during the 1470s in Germany. Improved versions of the Ottoman arquebus were transported to India by Babur in 1526.

The matchlock was claimed to have been introduced to China by the Portuguese. The Chinese obtained the matchlock arquebus technology from the Portuguese in the 16th century and matchlock firearms were used by the Chinese into the 19th century. The Chinese used the term &quot;bird-gun&quot; to refer to muskets and Turkish muskets may have reached China before Portuguese ones.

In Japan, the first documented introduction of the matchlock, which became known as the &quot;tanegashima&quot;, was through the Portuguese in 1543. The &quot;tanegashima&quot; seems to have been based on &quot;snap matchlocks&quot; that were produced in the armory of Goa in Portuguese India, which was captured by the Portuguese in 1510. While the Japanese were technically able to produce tempered steel (e.g. sword blades), they preferred to use work-hardened brass springs in their matchlocks. The name &quot;tanegashima&quot; came from the island where a Chinese junk (a type of ship) with Portuguese adventurers on board was driven to anchor by a storm. The lord of the Japanese island Tanegashima Tokitaka (1528–1579) purchased two matchlock rifles from the Portuguese and put a swordsmith to work copying the matchlock barrel and firing mechanism. Within a few years, the use of the &quot;tanegashima&quot; in battle forever changed the way war was fought in Japan.

Despite the appearance of more advanced ignition systems, such as that of the wheellock and the snaphance, the low cost of production, simplicity, and high availability of the matchlock kept it in use in European armies. It left service around 1750. It was eventually completely replaced by the flintlock as the foot soldier&#x27;s main armament.

In Japan, matchlocks continued to see military use up to the mid-19th century. In China, matchlock guns were still being used by imperial army soldiers in the middle decades of the 19th century.

There is evidence that matchlock rifles may have been in use among some peoples in Christian Abyssinia in the late Middle Ages. Although modern rifles were imported into Ethiopia during the 19th century, contemporary British historians noted that, along with slingshots, matchlock rifle weapons were used by the elderly for self-defense and by the militaries of the Ras.

Under Qing rule, the Hakka on Taiwan owned matchlock muskets. Han people traded and sold matchlock muskets to the Taiwanese aborigines. During the Sino-French War, the Hakka and Aboriginals used their matchlock muskets against the French in the Keelung Campaign and Battle of Tamsui. The Hakka used their matchlock muskets to resist the Japanese invasion of Taiwan (1895) and Han Taiwanese and Aboriginals conducted an insurgency against Japanese rule.

== 20th century use ==
Arabian Bedouin families continued using matchlocks well into the 20th century, and matchlocks were often passed down as family heirlooms within Bedouin families. The reliability of the matchlock made it the weapon of choice for Bedouins, who sometimes chose to convert flintlocks into matchlocks.

Tibetans have used matchlocks from as early as the sixteenth century until very recently. The early 20th century explorer Sven Hedin also encountered Tibetan tribesmen on horseback armed with matchlock rifles along the Tibetan border with Xinjiang. Tibetan nomad fighters used arquebuses for warfare during the Annexation of Tibet by the People&#x27;s Republic of China as late as the second half of the 20th century—and Tibetan nomads reportedly still use matchlock rifles to hunt wolves and other predatory animals. These matchlock arquebuses typically feature a long, sharpened retractable forked stand.

<text>HMAS &quot;Hawk&quot; (M 1139) (formerly HMS &quot;Somerlyton) was a operated by the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). The minesweeper was built for the Royal Navy asHMS &quot;Gamston, but renamed HMS &quot;Somerlyton&quot; before entering service. She was sold to Australia in 1961, and commissioned as HMAS &quot;Hawk&quot; in 1962. The ship operated through the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and was decommissioned in 1972.

==Construction==
The minesweeper was laid down for the Royal Navy by Richards Ironworks at Lowestoft, England. She was launched on 1 July 1954 as HMS &quot;Gamston&quot;, but was renamed HMS &quot;Somerlyton&quot; before entering service.

==Operational history==

===Australia===
The ship was purchased by Australia in 1961 and commissioned into the RAN as HMAS &quot;Hawk&quot; on 18 July 1962.

&quot;Hawk&quot; was one of several Australian warships deployed to Malaysia to protect the nation during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. She became the second Australian minesweeper to see action during the Confrontation on 13 March 1966, when she came under fire from an Indonesian shore battery while patrolling off Raffles Light. Eleven high explosive rounds were fired at the ship, some landing within of the vessel, before &quot;Hawk&quot; withdrew from the area at speed. The following morning, &quot;Hawk&quot; intercepted a sampan and arrested the five Indonesians on board. The minesweeper&#x27;s service during Confrontation was later recognised with the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964–66&quot;.

==Decommissioning and fate==
HMAS &quot;Hawk&quot; paid off on 7 January 1972.

<doc id="452570" wikidata="Q311439" url="?curid=452570" title="ECM Records">
<text>ECM (Edition of Contemporary Music) is an independent record label founded by Karl Egger, Manfred Eicher and Manfred Scheffner in Munich in 1969. While ECM is best known for jazz music, the label has released a variety of recordings, and ECM&#x27;s artists often refuse to acknowledge boundaries between genres. ECM&#x27;s motto is &quot;the most beautiful sound next to silence&quot;, taken from a 1971 review of ECM releases in &quot;Coda&quot;, a Canadian jazz magazine.

ECM has been distributed in the U.S. by Warner Bros. Records, PolyGram Records, BMG, and, since 1999, Universal Music, the successor of PolyGram, worldwide. Its album covers were profiled in two books: &quot;Sleeves of Desire&quot; and &quot;Windfall Light&quot;, both published by Lars Müller.

==History==
The first ECM release produced by Manfred Scheffner was pianist Mal Waldron&#x27;s 1969 recording &quot;Free at Last&quot;. The label went on to release recordings by many prominent jazz musicians, including Paul Bley, Keith Jarrett, Jan Garbarek, Pat Metheny, Gary Burton, Chick Corea, Charlie Haden, John Abercrombie, Dave Liebman, Eberhard Weber, Egberto Gismonti, Dave Holland, Terje Rypdal, Stefano Bollani and Ralph Towner. The label has also released recordings in the world music genre by artists including Steve Tibbetts, Stephan Micus, Codona, Anouar Brahem, L. Shankar, Jon Hassell, and Naná Vasconcelos.

Manfred Eicher continues to take an active interest in the music released by ECM, acting as producer of the vast majority of its recordings, although Steve Lake, Thomas Stoewsand, Robert Hurwitz, Lee Townsend, Hans Wendl and Sun Chung have also produced discs for the label. The typical ECM session is just three days: two days to record, one day to mix. Many of the albums have been recorded with Jan Erik Kongshaug (of Talent Studios and later Rainbow Studios) in Oslo, Norway, as sound engineer; other engineers have included Martin Wieland (who recorded Jarrett&#x27;s &quot;The Köln Concert&quot;), James Farber, Stefano Amerio and, on classical recordings, Peter Laenger.

=== New Series and commemorative editions ===
The &quot;ECM New Series&quot; was created in 1984 to document Western classical works. It has released works by composers from the early (Thomas Tallis, Carlo Gesualdo, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina) to the contemporary (John Cage, Elliott Carter, Steve Reich and John Adams). The series was initiated for Arvo Pärt&#x27;s record debut &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;, which Eicher recorded and produced in 1977, 1983, and 1984. Since then Pärt and Eicher have built a strong relationship: all works premiere on recordings for the label and all are done in presence of the composer. Keith Jarrett, better known as a jazz musician, contributed together with Gidon Kremer amongst others to &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;. He later recorded several classical works by Bach, Mozart, Shostakovich, and others for the series.

The three albums &quot;Music for 18 Musicians&quot;, &quot;Octet/Music for a Large Ensemble/Violin Phase&quot;, and &quot;Tehillim&quot; by Reich were recorded before 1984 (all with the composer performing) and were later moved to the classical department together with some by Meredith Monk, Thomas Demenga and Harald Weiss. Several of John Adams&#x27; works from his minimalist period have been released through the label as well, including &quot;Harmonium&quot; and &quot;Harmonielehre&quot;.

Over the years, many other works by contemporary composers such as Valentyn Sylvestrov, Tigran Mansurian, Erkki-Sven Tüür, Heinz Holliger, Giya Kancheli, György Kurtág, or Heiner Goebbels as well as the soundtracks of several works by the filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard have been issued on the &quot;ECM New Series&quot; label. Interpreters who released records in classical genres include Kim Kashkashian, András Schiff, Gidon Kremer, the Hilliard Ensemble, Thomas Zehetmair, Carolin Widmann, Till Fellner, Herbert Henck, Alexei Lubimov, András Keller, Miklós Perényi, John Holloway, John Potter or most recently Patricia Kopatchinskaja.

On many releases, the orientations towards jazz and classical music of ECM are combined: For example, Garbarek&#x27;s &quot;Officium&quot; (1994) features him playing saxophone solos over the Hilliard Ensemble singing Gregorian chant, early polyphony and Renaissance works. Garbarek&#x27;s work with guitarist Ralph Towner continued, and has been influenced by 20th century chamber music as much as by jazz-oriented material. John Potter, formerly of the Hilliard Ensemble, recorded works by John Dowland with jazz saxophonist John Surman and others, and Surman&#x27;s &quot;Proverbs and Songs&quot; is a suite of choral settings of Old Testament texts, recorded in Salisbury Cathedral. The label has also released unique works that fit into no obvious genre at all (like the records of composer Meredith Monk).

In 2002 and 2004, ECM released a series of compilation CDs titled &quot;:rarum&quot;. Twenty of the label&#x27;s artists were asked to compile a single CD of their work. (Garbarek&#x27;s and Jarrett&#x27;s compilations are double CDs.) Artists who contributed to this series are Keith Jarrett, Jan Garbarek, Chick Corea, Gary Burton, Bill Frisell, Art Ensemble of Chicago, Terje Rypdal, Bobo Stenson, Pat Metheny, Dave Holland, Egberto Gismonti, Jack DeJohnette, John Surman, John Abercrombie, Carla Bley, Paul Motian, Tomasz Stańko, Eberhard Weber, Arild Andersen, Jon Christensen.

After working as a writer for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine, Steve Lake first joined the ECM-staff in 1978. While working predominantly for the writing department he now has also produced more than 40 records which are more in the experimental areas of jazz like ones of Evan Parker, Roscoe Mitchell, Hal Russell, Robin Williamson, Joe Maneri or Mat Maneri. Furthermore, he published the book &quot;Horizons Touched: The Music of ECM&quot; (2007) with music critic/novelist Paul Griffiths and made contributions to the books &quot;Sleeves of Desire: a Cover Story&quot; (1996), &quot;Windfall Light: The Visual Language of ECM&quot; (2010) and &quot;ECM - A Cultural Archaeology&quot; (2012).

=== Recent developments in online distribution ===
On November 14, 2017, ECM announced in a press release that its entire catalog would be made available for streaming on all major music streaming platforms (Apple Music, Amazon, Spotify, Deezer, Tidal and Qobuz). Previously, ECM recordings had never been available for streaming, save for a few select compilations of major performers. In a press release on its website, ECM explained its decision:

In recent years, ECM and the musicians have had to face unauthorized streaming of recordings via video sharing websites, plus piracy, bootlegs, and a proliferation of illegal download sites. It was important to make the catalogue accessible within a framework, where copyrights are respected.

ECM further added that the physical recordings (CD &amp; vinyl records) still constitute the &quot;preferred mediums&quot;.

== Exhibitions about ECM ==
In fall 2012, the Munich museum Haus der Kunst opened an exhibition about the work of the label called &quot;ECM – A Cultural Archaeology&quot;. It pointed out the early jazz-focused years until the mid-1980s, before the &quot;New Series&quot; was initiated. In close relation with Eicher and ECM, the exhibition was created by art curator Okwui Enwezor and Markus Müller. To complement the historically oriented content of the exhibition, it was accompanied with a concert series of current artists of the label, which included François Couturier, Enrico Rava, Meredith Monk, András Schiff, Evan Parker, Gidon Kremer or Tomasz Stańko. Some of these artists have a long relationship with the label—even if their &#x27;home&#x27; is &quot;ECM&quot; or &quot;New Series&quot;. 

Additionally, Eicher curated a film series of eleven selected movies, which relate to the label. While some of its filmmakers have been related to ECM, like Theo Angelopoulos or Jean-Luc Godard, others gave inspiration to the label, like Ingmar Bergman or Andrei Tarkovsky, and others used music by ECM. The physical catalogue of the exhibition was published by Prestel Verlag in German and English. Another extended exhibition was displayed in Seoul, Korea, from September until November 2013. Under the Gertrude Stein quote &quot;Think of your Ears as Eyes&quot;, the exhibition took a wider view on the label&#x27;s history than the one in Munich. Again, it was accompanied by a concert series, including Kim Kashkashian, András Schiff, Myung-whun Chung, Heinz Holliger, Norma Winstone, Ralph Towner and Yeahwon Shin.

== ECM and film ==
The label has a special relation towards film and directors. Founder Manfred Eicher himself is a very passionate movie viewer and directed in 1990 an adaption of Max Frisch&#x27;s &quot;Holozän&quot; together with Heinz Bütler. The label has also released some soundtracks e.g. for &quot;The Return&quot; (2003) by Andrey Zvyagintsev or &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1600-01) and &quot;Histoire(s) du cinéma&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1706) by French-Swiss director Jean-Luc Godard. This collaboration expanded over the years and led on the one hand into the contribution of several stills from Godard&#x27;s movies for covers like &quot;Morimur&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1765) by Christoph Poppen, &quot;Asturiana - Songs from Spain and Argentinia&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1975) by Kim Kashkashian or the 2011 &quot;Live at Birdland&quot; (ECM 2162) by Lee Konitz/Brad Mehldau/Charlie Haden/Paul Motian. On the other hand, Eicher took over the musical direction of many of Godard&#x27;s films like &quot;Germany Year 90 Nine Zero&quot;, &quot;Hélas pour moi&quot;, &quot;JLG&quot; or &quot;For Ever Mozart&quot;. Besides these Eicher was also the head behind the music of Xavier Koller&#x27;s &quot;Reise der Hoffnung&quot;, Sandra Nettelbeck&#x27;s &quot;Mostly Martha&quot; and the Oscar-nominated documentary &quot;War Photographer&quot; by Christian Frei. Additionally Godard has released a collection of short films on the label with Anne-Marie Miéville called &quot;Four Short Films&quot; (ECM 5001).

Apart from her own work Greek composer Eleni Karaindrou wrote scores for stage and for movies, which include &quot;Ulysses&#x27; Gaze&quot; (1995), &quot;Eternity and a Day&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Dust of Time&quot; (1999), among others by filmmaker Theo Angelopoulos released on ECM. The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who has also worked with Angelopoulos, has recorded two spoken word-albums for the label: one in 1984 with poems by Friedrich Hölderlin (ECM New Series 1285) and one in 1999 called &quot;Wenn Wasser Wäre&quot; (ECM New Series 1723) with works of T. S. Eliot and Giorgos Seferis. Another nameable release is the record &quot;Scardanelli&quot; (ECM 1761) with texts and music from Harald Bergmann&#x27;s film of the same name from 2000, which reflects the work of Hölderlin in his last years. In the title role, it features Austrian actor Walter Schmidinger who&#x27;s reading the poems and texts on this record taken from the movie. In fall 2012, ECM released a record called &quot;Turmgedichte&quot; (ECM New Series 2285) by actor/voice actor/vocalist Christian Reiner also with poems by Hölderlin.

Furthermore, ECM has many projects and albums dedicated to people involved with motion pictures. For example, Italian piano player Stefano Battaglia pays tribute to the work of director Pier Paolo Pasolini on his 2007 &quot;&quot; (ECM 1998-99). Its cover pictures a still from Pasolini&#x27;s 1964 &quot;The Gospel According to St. Matthew&quot;. In 2022 a recording of texts by the Italian film maker called &quot;Pier Paolo Pasolini: Land der Arbeit&quot; (ECM 2768) spoken in German by Reiner was released. Polish jazz trumpeter Tomasz Stańko recorded in 1994 &quot;Matka Joanna&quot; (ECM 1544) as an homage to Polish film director Jerzy Kawalerowicz&#x27;s movie &quot;Matka Joanna od Aniołów&quot; (1961). Three years later on his 1997 &quot;&quot; (ECM 1636) Stańko honors the work of another countryman and film composer Krzysztof Komeda who is widely known for the scores of several films by Roman Polanski but was also a jazz pianist. Polanski also contributed a preface for the booklet of &quot;Litania&quot;. The album &quot;Dans la Nuit&quot; (ECM 1805) by French woodwind player Louis Sclavis, who also was active as a film composer, is a new score for Charles Vanel&#x27;s 1930 silent movie &quot;Dans la nuit (film)&quot;. 

The French pianist François Couturier dedicated a couple of his works to the Soviet/Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky. This includes pieces on his 2010 solo record &quot;Un jour si blanc&quot; (ECM 2103) and the albums &quot;Nostalghia - Song for Tarkovsky&quot; (ECM 1979) from 2006 as well as the &quot;Tarkovsky Quartet&quot; (ECM 2159) from 2011 - both with photographs and movie stills of Tarkovsky in the booklet. Other examples of works dedicated to the director are &quot;Arbos&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1325) by Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, the piece &quot;Eight Hymns in memoriam Andrei Tarkovsky&quot; by composer Stevan Kovacs Tickmayer which can be found on Gidon Kremer&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Hymns and Prayers&quot; (ECM NewSeries 2161) or &quot;3rd Piece&quot; by Jan Garbarek on his solo record &quot;All Those Born with Wings&quot; (ECM 1324). In Spring 2013 ECM released the record &quot;La notte&quot; by Ketil Bjørnstad which took its inspiration from Italian filmmaker Michelangelo Antonioni; its title and cover were taken from the 1961 movie of the same name. Later that year an album by John Abercrombie was released with four allusions towards Hitchcock movies including the name of the title track taken from &quot;39 Steps&quot;. On her 2018 album &quot;Descansado: Songs for Films&quot; (ECM 2567) English singer Norma Winstone pays tribute to composers like Nino Rota, Michel Legrand, William Walton, Bernard Herrmann, and Ennio Morricone - all strongly connected to movies - by rearranging their pieces.

The connection with motion pictures spans further and is reflected in the design of the booklet of &quot;Mnemosyne&quot; (ECM NewSeries 1700) by Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble—the successor of its highly successful album &quot;Officium&quot; (ECM 1525). It includes stills from &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; (1957) by Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.

In 1986, director Jan Horne shot the 60-minute documentary &quot;Bare Stillheten&quot; about Eicher and the label in Munich, Oslo, and Tokyo for television with Garbarek, Terje Rypdal, Jon Christensen, Arild Andersen, John Surman, Eberhard Weber, and others participating. There is also a documentary by Peter Guyer and Norbert Wiedmer called &quot;Sounds and Silence&quot; (2010) which portraits exemplary the daily work of Manfred Eicher with various musicians including Arvo Pärt, Nik Bärtsch, Anouar Brahem, Dino Saluzzi and Anja Lechner, Jan Garbarek and Kim Kashkashian or Gianluigi Trovesi and Gianni Coscia. The soundtrack with tracks from the recording sessions seen in the movie was as well as the documentary also released on ECM called &quot;Music for the Film - Sounds and Silence&quot; (ECM 2250). A documentary about reed player Charles Lloyd called &quot;Arrows Into Infinity&quot; (ECM 5052), directed by his wife Dorothy Darr together with Jeffery Morse, was released in July 2014. Another project from 2014 shows moving images by Prashant Bhargava with music by Vijay Iyer called &quot;Radhe Radhe: Rites of Holi&quot; (ECM 5507). In 2018 followed a portrait about Abercrombie called &quot;Open Land: Meeting John Abercrombie&quot; (ECM 5053), filmed by Arno Oehri and Oliver Primus.
Besides these movies, ECM has also released concert videos of Karaindrou, Marc Sinan, Keith Jarrett solo and with his &quot;Standards&quot; trio.

<text>Zuytdorp, also &quot;Zuiddorp&quot; (meaning &#x27;South Village&#x27;, after Zuiddorpe, an extant village in the south of Zeeland in the Netherlands, near the Belgian border) was an 18th-century trading ship of the Dutch East India Company (, commonly abbreviated VOC).

On 1 August 1711, &quot;Zuytdorp&quot; was dispatched from the Netherlands to the trading port of Batavia (now Jakarta, Indonesia) bearing a load of freshly minted silver coins. Many trading ships travelled the Brouwer Route, using the strong Roaring Forties winds to carry them across the Indian Ocean to within sight of the west coast of Australia (then called New Holland), whence they would turn north towards Batavia.

&quot;Zuytdorp&quot; did not arrive at its destination and was never heard from again. No search was undertaken, presumably because the VOC did not know whether or where the ship wrecked or if it was taken by pirates. Previous expensive attempts were made to search for other missing ships, but these failed even when an approximate wreck location was known.

In the mid-20th century, &quot;Zuytdorp&quot;″s wreck site was identified on a remote part of the Western Australian coast between Kalbarri and Shark Bay, approximately north of the Murchison River. This section of coastline, subsequently named the Zuytdorp Cliffs, was the preserve of Aboriginal people and had been one of the last uncolonised areas until sheep stations were established there in the late 19th century. It has been speculated that survivors of the wreck may have traded with or intermarried with local Aboriginal communities between Kalbarri and Shark Bay.

There was news of an unidentified shipwreck on the shore in 1834 when Aboriginal people told a farmer near Perth about a wreckthe colonists presumed it was a recent wreck and sent rescue parties who failed to find the wreck or any survivors. In 1927, wreckage was seen by an Indigenous-European family group (including Ada and Ernest Drage, Tom and Lurleen Pepper, Charlie Mallard) on a clifftop near the border of Murchison house and Tamala Stations. Bertie and Pearl Drage, Jack Brand and Mrs Brand and two Aboriginal workers including a man named Nyarda are also understood to have been involved. Tamala Station head stockman Tom Pepper reported the find to the authorities, with their first visit to the site occurring in 1941. In 1954 Pepper gave Phillip Playford directions to the wreckage. Playford identified the relics as from &quot;Zuytdorp&quot;. 

== First dives and salvage attempts ==
The first dive in May 1964 and the sighting of a massive silver deposit in 1967 resulted in successful salvage attempts by teams led by Tom Brady of Geraldton, and Perth-based Alan Robinson who utilised the services of Clive Daw (who had visited the site by land on other occasions) in order to facilitate his work. 
== Western Australian Museum&#x27;s work ==
Harry Bingham and his chief diver Geoff Kimpton were successful in recovering silver and other materials in 1971, as was a team led by Jeremy Green in 1976 and on other occasions. Salvage work ceased in 1981 due to the perceived dangers of working the site. Thereafter a watch-keeper was appointed to guard the site.

The site, one of the few restricted zones under the Commonwealth &quot;Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976&quot; and &quot;Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018&quot;, required a permit to visit and was under regular surveillance. A permit is still required.

When work recommenced in 1986 led by M. (Mack) McCarthy (with the museum&#x27;s chief diver Geoff Kimpton) it was found that the silver deposit had all but disappeared. 

Soon after the program entered its multi-disciplinary phase, becoming the first of the Western Australian Museum’s VOC studies to embrace the practice. Geologist-historian Phillip Playford joined the team, as did pre-historians Sandra Bowdler, Kate Morse, terrestrial historical archaeologists including Fiona Weaver and Tom Pepper Jr., (representing station and Indigenous interests), surveyors, the Department of Land Administration, and artists. Oral histories were recorded with station identities, including relatives of the Pepper, Drage, Blood, Mallard and other Indigenous families involved with the wreck. Foremost in this new phase was the attention paid to the possibilities of European-Indigenous interaction and the movement of survivors away from the wreck. 

Phillip Playford&#x27;s book, &quot;Carpet of Silver: The Wreck of the Zuytdorp was&quot; produced as part of the museum&#x27;s research. The book won the Western Australian Premier’s Book Awards when it was first published in 1996.

The museums in both Fremantle and at Geraldton presented exhibitions on the wreck, a website, and reports. An exhibition was also produced for the Kalbarri heritage centre. Due to the logistical difficulties and the advent of Health and Safety legislation, the Zuytdorp in-water program ceased in 2002, though work on land and in the laboratory remains active. 

Historian Bill Bunbury reviewed the wreck and consequences in the chapter &quot;A Lost Ship – Lost People: The Zuytdorp Story&quot; in the book &quot;Caught in Time: Talking Australia History.&quot;

== Dutch-Aboriginal intermarriage theory and rock inscriptions ==
In 1988, an American woman who had married into the Mallard family contacted Phillip Playford and described how her husband had died some years before from a disease called variegate porphyria. Playford found that the disease was genetically linked and initially confined to Afrikaners and that all cases of the disease in South Africa were traceable to Gerrit Jansz and Ariaantjie Jacobs, who had married in Cape of Good Hope in 1688.

&quot;Zuytdorp&quot; arrived at the Cape in March 1712, where it took on more than 100 new crew. One of the Jansz&#x27; sons could have boarded the ship at this time and thus become the carrier of the disease into the Australian Aboriginal population. In 2002 a DNA investigation into the hypothesis that a variegate porphyria mutation was introduced into the Aboriginal population by shipwrecked sailors was undertaken at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre in Nedlands, Western Australia, and the Stellenbosch University in South Africa. The research concluded the mutations were not inherited from shipwrecked sailors.

The presence of similar European genetic maladies in the Aboriginal population (such as Ellis–Van Creveld syndrome) as from VOC shipwreck survivors is also doubtful. Dutch–Indigenous links via the VOC wrecks are rendered less certain because of the importation of hundreds of divers for use in the Western Australian pearling field in the mid-to-late 19th century. Incorrectly called Malays, these indentured labourers came from the islands north of Australia, many via the port of Batavia. One vessel, the for example, brought 140 Malay boys aged 12–14 for use in the pearling field. They boarded at Batavia where diseases (including genetic diseases) had been introduced by VOC personnel into the local population since 1600. In addition, many Malay pearlers remained on the coast and some intermarried with Aboriginal people at Shark Bay. Therefore, it is equally possible that genetic links between Aboriginal Australians and the Dutch can be traced to those sources. The Macassans, who frequented northern Australian shores for centuries and who mixed with the coastal Aborigines and even took some of them back to Macassar, are another possible source. 

The possibility Aboriginal groups joined survivors from &quot;Zuytdorp&quot; or mutineers from &quot;Batavia&quot; inspired the Walga Rock ship painting was another popular belief. This theory has been challenged as new evidence points to the image being a steamship, possibly &quot;Xantho&quot;.

There was also renewed interest in the authenticity of rock inscriptions, predominantly one reading &quot;Zuytdorp 1711&quot; that was once visible on a rock-face adjacent to the reef platform at the site. Post-dating Phillip Playford&#x27;s first visits in 1954–55, when photographs of the same area show no inscription, the inscription is considered a modern artefact.

== Commemorative plaque ==
In June 2012, the Shire of Northampton unveiled a commemorative plaque in Kalbarri commemorating the 300th anniversary of &quot;Zuytdorp&quot;″s wreck. The plaque also mentions &quot;Batavia&quot; and , two other VOC ships that were wrecked in the area.

== Recent Developments and renewed research ==
Ernie Dingo visited the site to learn more about his estranged father Tom Pepper Jr and his grandparents Tom Snr and Lurlie Pepper. This investigation appeared in a 2018 edition of Who Do You Think You Are.

Playford’s book &quot;Carpet of Silver&quot; was reprinted unaltered in 1998 and 2006. The last of the Western Australian Museum&#x27;s works was an internal report produced in 2009, 

After retiring from the Western Australian Museum in 2019, McCarthy sought to fill that gap, resulting in &quot;The Zuytdorp Research Compendium&quot;, an stakeholders in accessing all that is now known about the subject. Presented in April 2024 to the Department of Maritime Heritage at the Western Australian Museum as an electronic internal report, this roughly 500-page work contains McCarthy&#x27;s research and links to all other known sources and archives including those of the VOC, early explorers, salvage divers, Aboriginal families, scientists, linguists and other researchers and enthusiasts.

<text>In physics and engineering, a free body diagram (FBD; also called a force diagram) is a graphical illustration used to visualize the applied forces, moments, and resulting reactions on a free body in a given condition. It depicts a body or connected bodies with all the applied forces and moments, and reactions, which act on the body(ies). The body may consist of multiple internal members (such as a truss), or be a compact body (such as a beam). A series of free bodies and other diagrams may be necessary to solve complex problems. Sometimes in order to calculate the resultant force graphically the applied forces are arranged as the edges of a polygon of forces or force polygon (see ).

==Free body==
A body is said to be &quot;free&quot; when it is singled out from other bodies for the purposes of dynamic or static analysis. The object does not have to be &quot;free&quot; in the sense of being unforced, and it may or may not be in a state of equilibrium; rather, it is not fixed in place and is thus &quot;free&quot; to move in response to forces and torques it may experience.


Figure 1 shows, on the left, green, red, and blue widgets stacked on top of each other, and for some reason the red cylinder happens to be the body of interest. (It may be necessary to calculate the stress to which it is subjected, for example.) On the right, the red cylinder has become the free body. In figure 2, the interest has shifted to just the left half of the red cylinder and so now it is the free body on the right. The example illustrates the context sensitivity of the term &quot;free body&quot;. A cylinder can be part of a free body, it can be a free body by itself, and, as it is composed of parts, any of those parts may be a free body in itself.
Figure 1 and 2 are not yet free body diagrams. In a completed free body diagram, the free body would be shown with forces acting on it.

== Purpose ==
Free body diagrams are used to visualize forces and moments applied to a body and to calculate reactions in mechanics problems. These diagrams are frequently used both to determine the loading of individual structural components and to calculate internal forces within a structure. They are used by most engineering disciplines from Biomechanics to Structural Engineering.
In the educational environment, a free body diagram is an important step in understanding certain topics, such as statics, dynamics and other forms of classical mechanics.

==Features==

A free body diagram is not a scaled drawing, it is a diagram. The symbols used in a free body diagram depends upon how a body is modeled.

Free body diagrams consist of:
* A simplified version of the body (often a dot or a box)
* Forces shown as straight arrows pointing in the direction they act on the body
* Moments are shown as curves with an arrow head or a vector with two arrow heads pointing in the direction they act on the body
* One or more reference coordinate systems
* By convention, reactions to applied forces are shown with hash marks through the stem of the vector

The number of forces and moments shown depends upon the specific problem and the assumptions made. Common assumptions are neglecting air resistance and friction and assuming rigid body action. 

In statics all forces and moments must balance to zero; the physical interpretation is that if they do not, the body is accelerating and the principles of statics do not apply. In dynamics the resultant forces and moments can be non-zero.

Free body diagrams may not represent an entire physical body. Portions of a body can be selected for analysis. This technique allows calculation of internal forces, making them appear external, allowing analysis. This can be used multiple times to calculate internal forces at different locations within a physical body. 

For example, a gymnast performing the iron cross: modeling the ropes and person allows calculation of overall forces (body weight, neglecting rope weight, breezes, buoyancy, electrostatics, relativity, rotation of the earth, etc.). Then remove the person and show only one rope; you get force direction. Then only looking at the person the forces on the hand can be calculated. Now only look at the arm to calculate the forces and moments at the shoulders, and so on until the component you need to analyze can be calculated.

=== Modeling the body ===

A body may be modeled in three ways:

* &quot;a particle&quot;. This model may be used when any rotational effects are zero or have no interest even though the body itself may be extended. The body may be represented by a small symbolic blob and the diagram reduces to a set of concurrent arrows. A force on a particle is a &quot;bound&quot; vector.
* &quot;rigid extended&quot;. Stresses and strains are of no interest but rotational effects are. A force arrow should lie along the line of force, but where along the line is irrelevant. A force on an extended rigid body is a &quot;sliding&quot; vector.
* &quot;non-rigid extended&quot;. The &quot;point of application&quot; of a force becomes crucial and has to be indicated on the diagram. A force on a non-rigid body is a &quot;bound&quot; vector. Some use the tail of the arrow to indicate the point of application. Others use the tip.
===What is included===

An FBD represents the body of interest and the external forces acting on it.

* The body: This is usually a schematic depending on the body—particle/extended, rigid/non-rigid—and on what questions are to be answered. Thus if rotation of the body and torque is in consideration, an indication of size and shape of the body is needed. For example, the brake dive of a motorcycle cannot be found from a single point, and a sketch with finite dimensions is required. 
* The external forces: These are indicated by labelled arrows. In a fully solved problem, a force arrow is capable of indicating
** the direction and the line of action
** the magnitude
** the point of application
** a reaction, as opposed to an applied force, if a hash is present through the stem of the arrow

Often a provisional free body is drawn before everything is known. The purpose of the diagram is to help to determine magnitude, direction, and point of application of external loads. When a force is originally drawn, its length may not indicate the magnitude. Its line may not correspond to the exact line of action. Even its orientation may not be correct. 

External forces known to have negligible effect on the analysis may be omitted after careful consideration (e.g. buoyancy forces of the air in the analysis of a chair, or atmospheric pressure on the analysis of a frying pan).

External forces acting on an object may include friction, gravity, normal force, drag, tension, or a human force due to pushing or pulling. When in a non-inertial reference frame (see coordinate system, below), fictitious forces, such as centrifugal pseudoforce are appropriate.

At least one coordinate system is always included, and chosen for convenience. Judicious selection of a coordinate system can make defining the vectors simpler when writing the equations of motion or statics. The &quot;x&quot; direction may be chosen to point down the ramp in an inclined plane problem, for example. In that case the friction force only has an &quot;x&quot; component, and the normal force only has a &quot;y&quot; component. The force of gravity would then have components in both the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; directions: &quot;mg&quot;sin(&quot;θ&quot;) in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;mg&quot;cos(&quot;θ&quot;) in the &quot;y&quot;, where &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between the ramp and the horizontal.

===Exclusions===
A free body diagram should &quot;not&quot; show:
* Bodies other than the free body.
* Constraints.
** (The body is not free from constraints; the constraints have just been replaced by the forces and moments exerted on the body.)
* Forces exerted &quot;by&quot; the free body.
**(A diagram showing the forces exerted both on &quot;and&quot; by a body is likely to be confusing since all the forces will cancel out. By Newton&#x27;s 3rd law if body &quot;A&quot; exerts a force on body &quot;B&quot; then &quot;B&quot; exerts an equal and opposite force on &quot;A&quot;. This should not be confused with the equal and opposite forces that are necessary to hold a body in equilibrium.)
* Internal forces. 
** (For example, if an entire truss is being analyzed, the forces between the individual truss members are not included.)
* Velocity or acceleration vectors.

==Analysis==
In an analysis, a free body diagram is used by summing all forces and moments (often accomplished along or about each of the axes). When the sum of all forces and moments is zero, the body is at rest or moving and/or rotating at a constant velocity, by Newton&#x27;s first law. If the sum is not zero, then the body is accelerating in a direction or about an axis according to Newton&#x27;s second law.

===Forces not aligned to an axis===

Determining the sum of the forces and moments is straightforward if they are aligned with coordinate axes, but it is more complex if some are not. It is convenient to use the components of the forces, in which case the symbols ΣFx and ΣFy are used instead of ΣF (the variable M is used for moments). 

Forces and moments that are at an angle to a coordinate axis can be rewritten as two vectors that are equivalent to the original (or three, for three dimensional problems)—each vector directed along one of the axes (&quot;Fx&quot;) and (&quot;Fy&quot;).

== Example: A block on an inclined plane ==
A simple free-body diagram, shown above, of a block on a ramp, illustrates this.
* All external supports and structures have been replaced by the forces they generate. These include:
** &quot;mg&quot;: the product of the mass of the block and the constant of gravitation acceleration: its weight.
** &quot;N&quot;: the normal force of the ramp.
** &quot;Ff&quot;: the friction force of the ramp.
* The force vectors show the direction and point of application and are labelled with their magnitude.
* It contains a coordinate system that can be used when describing the vectors.

Some care is needed in interpreting the diagram.
* The normal force has been shown to act at the midpoint of the base, but if the block is in static equilibrium its true location is directly below the centre of mass, where the weight acts because that is necessary to compensate for the moment of the friction. 
* Unlike the weight and normal force, which are expected to act at the tip of the arrow, the friction force is a sliding vector and thus the point of application is not relevant, and the friction acts along the whole base.

== Polygon of forces ==

In the case of two applied forces, their sum (resultant force) can be found graphically using a parallelogram of forces.

To graphically determine the resultant force of multiple forces, the acting forces can be arranged as edges of a polygon by attaching the beginning of one force vector to the end of another in an arbitrary order. Then the vector value of the resultant force would be determined by the missing edge of the polygon. In the diagram, the forces P1 to P6 are applied to the point O. The polygon is constructed starting with P1 and P2 using the parallelogram of forces (vertex a). The process is repeated (adding P3 yields the vertex b, etc.). The remaining edge of the polygon O-e represents the resultant force R.

==Kinetic diagram==
In dynamics a kinetic diagram is a pictorial device used in analyzing mechanics problems when there is determined to be a net force and/or moment acting on a body. They are related to and often used with free body diagrams, but depict only the net force and moment rather than all of the forces being considered.

Kinetic diagrams are not required to solve dynamics problems; their use in teaching dynamics is argued against by some in favor of other methods that they view as simpler. They appear in some dynamics texts but are absent in others.

<text>Arimaa () is a two-player strategy board game that was designed to be playable with a standard chess set and difficult for computers while still being easy to learn and fun to play for humans. It was invented between 1997 and 2002 by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Syed was inspired by Garry Kasparov&#x27;s defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue to design a new game which could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand. (&quot;Arimaa&quot; is &quot;Aamir&quot; spelled backwards plus an initial &quot;a&quot;.)

Beginning in 2004, the Arimaa community held three annual tournaments: a World Championship (humans only), a Computer Championship (computers only), and the Arimaa Challenge (human vs. computer). After eleven years of human dominance, the 2015 challenge was won decisively by the computer (Sharp by David Wu).

Arimaa has won several awards including &quot;GAMES Magazine&quot; 2011 Best Abstract Strategy Game, &quot;Creative Child Magazine&quot; 2010 Strategy Game of the Year, and the 2010 Parents&#x27; Choice Approved Award. It has also been the subject of several research papers.

==Rules==
Arimaa is played on an 8×8 board with four trap squares. There are six kinds of pieces, ranging from elephant (strongest) to rabbit (weakest). Stronger pieces can push or pull weaker pieces, and stronger pieces freeze weaker pieces. Pieces can be captured by dislodging them onto a trap square when they have no orthogonally adjacent pieces.

The two players, Gold and Silver, each control sixteen pieces. These are, in order from strongest to weakest: one elephant (), one camel (), two horses (), two dogs (), two cats (), and eight rabbits . These may be represented by the king, queen, rooks, bishops, knights, and pawns respectively when one plays using a chess set.
===Objective===
The main object of the game is to move a rabbit of one&#x27;s own color onto the home rank of the opponent, which is known as a goal. Thus Gold wins by moving a gold rabbit to the eighth rank, and Silver wins by moving a silver rabbit to the first rank. However, because it is difficult to usher a rabbit to the goal line while the board is full of pieces, an intermediate objective is to capture opposing pieces by pushing them into the trap squares.

The game can also be won by capturing all of the opponent&#x27;s rabbits (elimination) or by depriving the opponent of legal moves (immobilization). Compared to goal, these are uncommon.

===Setup===
The game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on the seventh and eighth ranks. Diagram 1 shows one possible initial placement.
===Movement===
After the pieces are placed on the board, the players alternate turns, starting with Gold. A turn consists of making one to four steps. With each step a piece may move into an unoccupied square one space left, right, forward, or backward, except that rabbits may not step backward. The steps of a turn may be made by a single piece or distributed among several pieces in any order.

A turn must make a net change to the position. Thus one cannot, for example, take one step forward and one step back with the same piece, effectively passing the turn and evading zugzwang. Furthermore, one&#x27;s turn may not create the same position with the same player to move as has been created twice before. This rule is similar to the situational super ko rule in the game of Go, which prevents endless loops, and is in contrast to chess where endless loops are considered draws. The prohibitions on passing and repetition make Arimaa a drawless game.

====Pushing and pulling====
The second diagram, from the same game as the initial position above, helps illustrate the remaining rules of movement.

A player may use two consecutive steps of a turn to dislodge an opposing piece with a stronger friendly piece which is adjacent in one of the four cardinal directions. For example, a player&#x27;s dog may dislodge an opposing rabbit or cat, but not a dog, horse, camel, or elephant. The stronger piece may &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;push&quot; the adjacent weaker piece. When pulling, the stronger piece steps into an empty square, and the square it came from is occupied by the weaker piece. The silver elephant on d5 could step to d4 (or c5 or e5) and pull the gold horse from d6 to d5. When pushing, the weaker piece is moved to an adjacent empty square, and the square it came from is occupied by the stronger piece. The gold elephant on d3 could push the silver rabbit on d2 to e2 and then occupy d2. Note that the rabbit on d2 can&#x27;t be pushed to d1, c2, or d3, because those squares are not empty.

Friendly pieces may not be dislodged. Also, a piece may not push and pull simultaneously. For example, the gold elephant on d3 could not simultaneously push the silver rabbit on d2 to e2 and pull the silver rabbit from c3 to d3. An elephant can never be dislodged, since there is nothing stronger.

====Freezing====
A piece which is adjacent in any cardinal direction to a stronger opposing piece is &quot;frozen&quot;, unless it is also adjacent to a friendly piece. Frozen pieces may not be moved by the owner, but may be dislodged by the opponent. A frozen piece can freeze another still weaker piece. The silver rabbit on a7 is frozen, but the one on d2 is able to move because it is adjacent to a silver piece. Similarly the gold rabbit on b7 is frozen, but the gold cat on c1 is not. The dogs on a6 and b6 do not freeze each other because they are of equal strength. An elephant cannot be frozen, since there is nothing stronger, but an elephant can be .

====Capturing====
A piece which enters a trap square is captured and removed from the game unless there is a friendly piece orthogonally adjacent. Silver could move to capture the gold horse on d6 by pushing it to c6 with the elephant on d5. A piece on a trap square is captured when all adjacent friendly pieces move away. Thus if the silver rabbit on c4 and the silver horse on c2 move away, voluntarily or by being dislodged, the silver rabbit on c3 will be captured.

Note that a piece may voluntarily step into a trap square, even if it is thereby captured. Also, the second step of a pulling maneuver is completed even if the piece doing the pulling is captured on the first step. For example, Silver could step the silver rabbit from f4 to g4 (so that it will no longer support pieces at f3), and then step the silver horse from f2 to f3, which captures the horse; the horse&#x27;s move could still pull the gold rabbit from f1 to f2.

==Strategy and tactics==
For beginning insights into good play, see the .

Karl Juhnke, twice Arimaa world champion, has written a book titled &quot;Beginning Arimaa&quot; which gives an introduction to Arimaa tactics and strategies. Also Jean Daligault, six time Arimaa world champion, wrote &quot;Arimaa Strategies and Tactics&quot; which is geared towards those who have started playing Arimaa and want to improve their game.

===Arimaa Challenge===
The Arimaa Challenge was a cash prize of around $10,000 that was to have been available annually until 2020 for the first computer program to win the human-versus-computer Arimaa challenge. As part of the conditions of the prize, the computer program must run on standard, off-the-shelf hardware.

The Arimaa Challenge was held twelve times, starting in 2004. Following the second match, Syed changed the format to require the software to win two out of three games against each of three players, to reduce the psychological pressure on individual volunteer defenders. Also Syed called for outside sponsorship of the Arimaa Challenge to build a bigger prize fund.
In the first five challenge cycles, David Fotland, programmer of Many Faces of Go, won the Arimaa Computer Championship and the right to play for the prize money, only to see his program beaten decisively each year. In 2009 Fotland&#x27;s program was surpassed by several new programs in the same year, the strongest of which was Clueless by Jeff Bacher. Humanity&#x27;s margin of dominance over computers appeared to widen each year from 2004 to 2008 as the best human players improved, but the 2009 Arimaa Challenge was more competitive. Clueless became the first bot to win two games of a Challenge match.

In 2010, Mattias Hultgren&#x27;s bot Marwin edged out Clueless in the computer championship. In the Challenge match Marwin became the first bot to win two out of three games against a single human defender, and also the first bot to win three of the nine games overall. In 2011, however, Marwin won only one of the nine games, and that one having received a material handicap. In 2012 a new challenger, Briareus, became the first program to defeat a top-ten player, sweeping all three games from the fifth-ranked human. In 2013, however, the humans struck back against Marwin, with #4 and #6 each sweeping including a handicap win, and #31 winning two of three games. In 2014, the computer bounced back to win two games, albeit no matches.

In 2015, Sharp made a substantial leap in playing strength. After having scored 6-6 in twelve games against its top two computer rivals the previous year, Sharp went undefeated in the computer tournaments of 2015, including 13-0 against the second- and third-place finishers. Sharp dominated the pre-Challenge screening against human opponents, winning 27 of 29 games. In the Challenge itself, Sharp clinched victory in each of the three mini-matches by winning the first six games, finishing 7-2 overall and winning the Arimaa challenge. Wu published a paper describing the algorithm and most of &quot;ICGA Journal&quot; Issue 38/1 was dedicated to this topic. The algorithm combined traditional alpha–beta pruning (changing sides every 4 ply) with heuristic functions manually written while analysing human expert games.

After DeepMind&#x27;s AlphaZero mastered Go, Chess, and Shogi simply by playing itself, Omar Syed announced a $10,000 prize for the creation of such an Arimaa bot which could win a 10-game match against Sharp. This has not yet been done.

<doc id="452585" wikidata="Q4032414" url="?curid=452585" title="79 Park Avenue">
<text>79 Park Avenue, also known as Harold Robbins&#x27; 79 Park Avenue, is an American drama television miniseries developed and co-written by Richard De Roy, based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Harold Robbins. The miniseries stars Lesley Ann Warren as Marja Fludjicki, a poor but beautiful girl who is forced into prostitution despite sincere efforts to make a living and ultimately becomes New York City&#x27;s most famous madam. It also stars Marc Singer and David Dukes.

Directed and produced by Paul Wendkos, the miniseries premiered on NBC on October 16, 1977, and concluded on October 18, 1977. Warren received critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for her performance.

==Cast==

;Guest stars

;Co-starring
==Production==
It stars Lesley Ann Warren as a prostitute and Marc Singer as a gangster struggling to survive in the 1930s. David Dukes, Barbara Barrie, Raymond Burr, and Polly Bergen co-starred.

The teleplay was split among three writers, with Richard DeRoy doing the first part, Jack Guss the second, and Lionel E. Siegel the third.

==Reception==
The show was a ratings success. Part I (which debuted on Sunday October 16, 1977) was the 10th most watched show in the United States for the week (22.3 rating, 16.3 million homes) and the ratings momentum jumped for the last two installments. Part II (Monday, October 17, 1977) was the second-most watched primetime show for the following week (29.9 rating, 21.8 million homes), and Part III (Tuesday October 18) was third. (27.7 rating, 20.2 million homes).

The critical reviews of the series were not positive, but not overly vicious, recognizing the series for what it was and no more. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the series a &quot;laughable tawdry throwback to movie eyebrow raisers of the &#x27;50s, though without any of their appealingly cheap panache. Television loves to raise the subject of sex and then avoid it like the plague.&quot; Joan Hanauer of UPI described the series as &quot;what is usually called a &#x27;woman&#x27;s show&#x27;&quot;, meaning, &quot;the romance is unrealistically sentimental and the moral tone is high, which in no way interferes with depicting the sleaziest kind of sex.&quot; She found the second installment to be strongest of the three.

And although he credited the performances of the lead actors, John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also underwhelmed by the series, calling it an &quot;already tired story ... manufactured for mass consumption with all of the artistic concern afforded a can of baked beans.&quot; O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s year end review of 1977 television referred to &quot;79 Park Avenue&quot; and &quot;Aspen&quot; as &quot;dumb pot-boilers&quot; which &quot;tarnished considerably&quot; the &quot;promising concept of mini-series.&quot;

That the series might be somewhat controversial due to the sexual nature of the story was known from the beginning. Executive Producer George Eckstein admitted &quot;broadcasting standards people got very apprehensive when it was announced that this property was going to be on TV.&quot; And when Fred Silverman took over at NBC in June 1978, he promised to stop lurid programming like &quot;79 Park Avenue&quot;. Silverman stopped plans for a sequel to the miniseries and also halted a planned rerun in 1979.

<text>Nebbiolo (, ; ) is an Italian red wine grape variety predominantly associated with its native Piedmont region, where it makes the &quot;Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita&quot; (DOCG) wines of Barolo, Barbaresco, Gattinara, Ghemme, and Roero, together with numerous DOC wines. Nebbiolo is thought to derive its name from the Italian or Piedmontese , meaning &#x27;fog&#x27;. During harvest, which generally takes place late in October, a deep, intense fog sets into the Langhe region where many Nebbiolo vineyards are located. Alternative explanations refer to the fog-like glaucous veil that forms over the berries as they reach maturity, or that perhaps the name is derived instead from the Italian word , meaning &#x27;&#x27;. Nebbiolo produces lightly-colored red wines which can be highly tannic in youth with scents of tar and roses. As they age, the wines take on a characteristic brick-orange hue at the rim of the glass and mature to reveal other aromas and flavours such as violets, tar, wild herbs, cherries, raspberries, truffles, tobacco, and prunes. Nebbiolo wines can require years of ageing to balance the tannins with other characteristics.

==History==
Ampelographers believe that Nebbiolo is indigenous to the Piedmont region, though there is some DNA evidence to suggest that it could have originated in the Valtellina area of northern Lombardy, just to the east. In the 1st century AD, Pliny the Elder noted the exceptional quality of the wine produced in the Pollentia region located northwest of what is now the Barolo DOCG zone. While Pliny does not explicitly name the grape responsible for these Pollenzo wines, his description of the wine bears similarities to later descriptions of Nebbiolo-based wines, making this potentially the first notation of wine made from Nebbiolo in the Piedmont region. The first explicit mention of Nebbiolo dates to 1268, in which a wine known as &quot;nibiol&quot; was described as growing in Rivoli near Turin. This was followed by a 1303 account of a producer in the Roero district described as having a barrel of &quot;nebiolo&quot; (sic). In the 1304 treatise &quot;Liber Ruralium Commodorum&quot;, the Italian jurist Pietro Crescenzi described wine made from &quot;nubiola&quot; as being of excellent quality. In the 15th century, statutes in the region of La Morra (in what is now the Barolo zone) demonstrated the high esteem that the Nebbiolo vine had in the area. According to these laws, the penalties for cutting down a Nebbiolo vine ranged from a heavy fine to having the right hand cut off or hanging for repeat offenders.

The grape first captured attention outside Piedmont in the 18th century, when the British were looking for alternative wine sources to Bordeaux due to prolonged political conflicts with the French. However, the lack of easy transport from Piedmont to London would keep the Piedmontese wine from having the enduring relationship with British connoisseurship that is associated with Bordeaux, port and sherry. Nonetheless, plantings of Nebbiolo continued to grow during the 19th century until the phylloxera epidemic hit. With vast swaths of vineyards devastated by the pest, some vineyard owners decided to replant with different grape varieties, with Barbera being a significant beneficiary. Today, Nebbiolo covers around 9% of Piedmont vineyards, compared to the 30% occupied by Barbera.

===Relationships with other varieties===

In 2004, research at the University of California-Davis and Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige found Nebbiolo to be related to Piedmont by way of two aromatic grape varieties – the Freisa grape of Piedmont and the French Rhone variety Viognier. This research further suggests a parent-offspring relationship between Nebbiolo and several Italian grapes including Freisa, Bubbierasco, Nebbiolo Rosé, and Vespolina of the Piedmont region, and the Lombardy grapes Negrara and Rossola nera. Additional DNA analysis also suggest a parent-offspring relationship with the Lombardy grape Brugnola, previously thought to be only a synonym for the Emilia-Romagna grape Fortana.

==Viticulture==
Compared to the annual growth cycle of other Piedmontese grape varieties, Nebbiolo is one of the first varieties to bud and the last variety to ripen with harvest taking place in mid to late October. In some vintages, producers are able to pick and complete fermentation of their Barbera and Dolcetto plantings before Nebbiolo is even harvested. To aid in ripening, producers will often plant Nebbiolo in the most favoured sites on south and southwestern-facing slopes, which give the grape more access to direct sunlight. The most ideal location is at an elevation between and must provide some natural shelter from wind. The vine is very susceptible to coulure, especially if there is wet weather during budbreak or flowering. While rains during this period can affect yield and quantity, rains that occur after the period of &quot;veraison&quot; can have a detrimental effect on quality. The most highly rated bottles of Piedmont Nebbiolo tend to come from vintages that had dry weather during September and October. Nebbiolo needs sufficient warmth to develop the sugars and fruit flavours needed to balance the grape&#x27;s naturally high acidity and tannins. In cooler climate areas, such as the subalpine regions of Carema, Valtellina and Donnaz, the grape will produce medium bodied wines with bracing acidity and tannins that need the benefit of a warm vintage.

Nebbiolo does not adapt particularly well to various vineyard soil types, preferring soils with high concentrations of calcareous marl such as those found on the right bank of the Tanaro river around Alba where Barolo and Barbaresco are produced. The grape can thrive in sandy soils, such as those on the left bank of the Tanaro around the Roero district but the wines from this soil type tend not to be as perfumed – lacking in particular the classic tar aromas. The slightly acidic pH of the sandy Roero soils tend to produce early maturing wines. The lighter wines of Ghemme and Gattinara come from the acidic porphyry soils of the hills between Novara and Vercelli. In the lower Aosta Valley, the soil has a high concentration of granite while the soils of the Valtellina region of Lombardy are predominantly schist based. In addition to soil type, the drainage ability and concentration of magnesium and potassium can have an influencing effect on the type of Nebbiolo wine produced.

===Clones===
Like many varieties (such as Pinot noir) with ancient pedigree, the Nebbiolo vine is genetically unstable and prone to mutation. As of 2001, there were around 40 different clones of Nebbiolo identified. The three main phenotypes used for winemaking are Lampia, Michet and Nebbiolo Rosé. 

While Nebbiolo Rosé was originally thought to be a Nebbiolo clone, DNA research has later shown it to be a separate grape variety that has a parent-offspring relationship with Nebbiolo. Although the DOCG regulations for Barolo and Barbaresco require the wines to be made from Nebbiolo only, Nebbiolo Rosé remains permitted in practice. Its impact is limited by the fact that Nebbiolo Rosé had fallen out of favour long before the discovery that it was a separate variety, due, in part, to its wine&#x27;s light colouring. Consequently, Nebbiolo Rosé accounts for only a small percentage of the vines grown for the production of Barolo and Barbaresco. Moreover, there are only a few bottlings where its presence is known to be significant.

The Lampia strain adapts best to different soil types. Perhaps due to inbreeding in Nebbiolo&#x27;s lineage, the vine is very prone to grape diseases caused by viruses. Viral infection of the Lampia genotype originally gave rise to the Michet phenotype (though the Michet clones now cultivated are free from the virus). While Michet adapts less readily to different soil types, its smaller bunches and lower yields makes for highly concentrated wines. In many vineyards, producers will maintain a variety of Nebbiolo clones in order to maximize their wines&#x27; complexity.

==Winemaking==
In the most notable expression of Nebbiolo, the wines of Barolo, there is a division between what is considered a &quot;traditional&quot; approach to Nebbiolo and a &quot;modernist&quot; approach. The roots of both styles can trace their history to the early &quot;pre-technology&quot; production of Nebbiolo. Prior to the advent of temperature-controlled fermentation, the late harvest dates for Nebbiolo meant that the wines began fermentation when the weather turned cold. These cool temperatures would delay fermentation for several days, extending the maceration period and extraction of phenolic compounds such as tannins. When fermentation did begin, temperatures would reach excessive levels of 95-100 °F (35-38 °C), which would drastically reduce potential aromas and flavours. With the high levels of tannins, these early Barolos would require five years or more of ageing in oak barrels to soften some of the astringency. Lack of understanding of proper hygiene led to less sanitary conditions than what both traditional and modernist producers maintain today. Those conditions led to the development of bacterial infection of cement fermentation tanks and old wood barrels, which contributed to the development of off flavours and potential wine faults that would require at least 24 hours decanting to alleviate.

Today&#x27;s winemaking for both traditionalists and modernists includes strict hygiene controls and the use of some modern winemaking equipment. Rather than fall into one hardline camp or the other, many producers take a middle-ground approach that utilizes some modernist techniques along with traditional winemaking. In general, the traditional approach to Nebbiolo involves long maceration periods of 20 to 30 days and the use of older large &quot;botti&quot; size barrels. The modern approach to Nebbiolo utilizes shorter maceration periods of 7 to 10 days and cooler fermentation temperatures between that preserve fruit flavours and aromas. Towards the end of the fermentation period, the cellars are often heated to encourage the start of malolactic fermentation which softens some of Nebbiolo&#x27;s harsh acidity. Modern winemakers tend to favour smaller barrels of new oak that need only a couple of years to soften the tannic grip of the wines. As new oak imparts notes of vanilla, it has the potential to cover up the characteristic rose notes of Nebbiolo.

===Blending===

In the Piedmont region, there is a long history of blending other grape varieties with Nebbiolo in order to add colour and/or soften the grape&#x27;s harsh tannins. In addition to the use of red wine grapes such as Barbera, Croatina, and Bonarda Piemontese, white wine grapes such Arneis and Favorita also have a history of being blended with Nebbiolo. Historically, the association of blending Arneis with Nebbiolo was so strong that a common synonym of the former is &quot;Barolo Bianco&quot; or &quot;white Barolo&quot;. Today, the DOCG regulations for Barolo and Barbaresco call for the wine to be a 100% varietal of Nebbiolo. In 1998, producers of the Barbaresco region drafted a proposal to allow 10-15% of other grape varieties into the wine, but bad press by Italian wine critics led to the rejection of that plan. While there is some speculation, from critics such as Oz Clarke, that Barbera or even Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon may be used to augment the colour and flavours of Barolos by some producers, there is no explicit proof that this is occurring.

For the Nebbiolo-based wines of the Roero DOC, between 2 and 5% of Arneis is permitted in the blend, but the majority of producers rarely use this allowance. Similarly, many producers in Ghemme and Gattinara who are allowed some blending of Vespolina, Croatina, and Bonarda opt instead to use nearly 100% Nebbiolo. In the Valtellina region of Lombardy Merlot, Pinot nero, Pignola, Prugnolo, and Rossola are permitted blending partners for Nebbiolo.

==Wine regions==
Nebbiolo is grown on of land globally as of 2010, with all but found in the northwest Italian region of Piedmont, where it forms the base of many of the regions most well known DOC and DOCG wines including Barolo, Barbaresco, Gattinara, Ghemme and Nebbiolo d&#x27;Alba. Despite the prestige and acclaim of Nebbiolo-based wine, it is far from being the most widely grown grape in Piedmont. In 2010, there were of Nebbiolo producing of wine which accounted for a little over 3% of Piedmont&#x27;s entire production. In contrast, there is nearly 15 times as much Barbera planted in the region. Outside Piedmont, it is found in the neighbouring regions of the Val d&#x27;Aosta region of Donnaz and Valtellina and Franciacorta in Lombardy. In the Veneto, there is a small amount which some producers use to make a Nebbiolo &quot;recioto&quot; wine.

Outside Italy, producers in the United States are experimenting with plantings totalling in California, Washington, Oregon and even Virginia. In the Northern Region of Baja California, Mexico, support the production of the Nebbiolo varietal. In Argentina there are planted in the San Juan province and Australian producers in the King Valley region of Victoria have found some success with of Nebbiolo plantings. Success has also been found in the Geographe Wine Region of Western Australia. Nebbiolo is also grown in smaller amounts in South Africa, Uruguay and Chile.

===Barolo &amp; Barbaresco===

The Piedmont region is considered the viticultural home of Nebbiolo and it is where the grape&#x27;s most notable wines are made. The consistent continental climate of the region, coupled with the influences of the Tanaro River produces a unique &quot;terroir&quot; for Nebbiolo that is not easily replicated in other parts of the world. The two most well-known Nebbiolo-based wines are the DOCG wines of the Barolo &amp; Barbaresco zones near Alba. Barbaresco is considered the lighter of the two and has less stringent DOCG regulations, with the &quot;normale&quot; bottlings requiring only 9 months in oak and 21 months of total ageing and the &quot;riserva&quot; bottlings requiring 45 total months of ageing. In contrast the Barolo DOCG requires 18 months in oak and 3 years total ageing for &quot;normale&quot; bottlings and 62 months total ageing for &quot;riserva&quot;. The minimum alcohol levels for the two regions vary slightly with Barbaresco requiring a minimum of 12.5% and Barolo 13%.(However, Barolo, as of 1999, now only requires a minimum of 12.5% as well)
The Barolo zone is three times the size of the Barbaresco zone with the different communes producing Nebbiolo-based wines with noticeable distinctions among them. In the commune of Castiglione Falletto, the wines are more powerful and concentrated with the potential for finesse. Nebbiolo grown in Monforte d&#x27;Alba has a firm tannic structure and the most potential for ageing. The Serralunga region produces the heaviest, full-bodied Nebbiolo wines and is also the last region to start its harvest, often two weeks after other areas have begun picking. These three regions located on the eastern edge of the zone have soils that are dominated by sand and limestone. In the west, the communes of La Morra and Barolo have soils dominated by chalk and marl and produce wines that are more perfumed and silkier in texture. Throughout both the Barolo and Barbaresco zones are deposits of clay which add considerable tannins to Nebbiolo.

===Rest of Piedmont and Italy===

Outside Barolo &amp; Barbaresco, Nebbiolo is found in the DOCG wines of Ghemme and Gattinara in the Novara and Vercelli hills of northern Piedmont. In these regions, the grape is known as Spanna and tends to produce lighter, more earthy wines. Rather than mandate a 100% Nebbiolo, producers are allowed to blend a small percentage of Bonarda, Croatina and Vespolina though most modern producers favour a high percentage of Nebbiolo. In the northwestern corner of Piedmont, near the Valle d&#x27;Aosta, the cool climate of Carema DOC produces Nebbiolo wines with much perfume but in some vintages will have difficulties with ripeness. In the Roero district located across the Tanaro River from Barolo and Barbaresco, the wines tend to be less tannic and lighter while those produced in nearby Alba under the Nebbiolo d&#x27;Alba DOC can have more complexity and body.

Outside Piedmont, there are significant plantings of Nebbiolo in the Lombardy region of Valtellina where the grape is known as Chiavennasca. The high yields and sub-alpine climate tend to produce Nebbiolo lacking ripeness with bracing acidity. Nebbiolo is also used to make a deeply concentrated Amarone-type wine known as Sfursat. In the Franciacorta, Nebbiolo is a permitted grape variety along with Barbera, Cabernet Franc and Merlot in the &quot;rosso&quot; wines of the region. Northwest of Piedmont, in the Valle Aosta, some Nebbiolo is grown in the Donnaz region near the border with Carema.

===United States===
In California, the influence of Italian immigrants in the early history of the state&#x27;s wine industry introduced Nebbiolo to the United States in the 19th century. As Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot increased in popularity in the 20th century, Nebbiolo—as well as other Italian grape varieties—steadily decreased in plantings. Today there are scattered plantings of Nebbiolo throughout the state with the majority located in the jug wine producing region of the Central Valley. As California wine producers aim to produce higher quality wines, there have been difficulties in locating ideally suited sites for Nebbiolo and the progress in producing world-class California Nebbiolo is considerably behind that of other Italian varietals like Sangiovese, Primitivo and even Barbera and Dolcetto. In Washington State, Nebbiolo was first planted in the Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley AVA in 1985 with the first varietal release in 1987. As in California, Washington producers are still trying to figure out which sites are best suited to grow Nebbiolo. While the wine is mainly produced as a varietal, some producers make blends with Dolcetto and Syrah added in.

===Australia ===

In Australia, winemakers found little early success with Nebbiolo as many of the earliest plantings were inland sites that turned out to be too warm and dry for the grape. Research into cooler-climate sites leads to more favourable examples coming from the marginal climate of Victoria&#x27;s King Valley, and the cooler Adelaide Hills. Further studies have indicated that the Mornington Peninsula and the Margaret River areas have similar amounts of rainfall, relative humidity and sunshine hours to the Langhe region of Piedmont. Bendigo, the Clare Valley and Mudgee, are also currently being explored for their Nebbiolo potential. There are now hundreds of Nebbiolo wines produced in Australia, mainly from Victoria&#x27;s north-east regions, and the Yarra Valley, and South Australia, in particular the Adelaide Hills. Australian styles produced can be from very light, almost clear, to dark, rich wines.

Nebbiolo has attracted some seriously obsessive Australian growers and makers over the years, and they have produced some very good examples of the grape. In most cases, the Australian regions where the variety does best tend to be ones where clouds of fog are not an uncommon sight in autumn and winter – inland and up high.

===Other regions===

In Ensenada, Mexico, producers (L.A. Cetto) have been experimenting with plantings of Nebbiolo in Baja California near the US border with promising results. There are 100% Nebbiolo wines produced from low-yielding plants with very good colour and fine qualities, like the wine produced at Arcilla.
In South America, early results in Chile have so far produced wines with high acidity and poor colour as winemakers work to find which clones are best suited for their climate. The development of Argentine Nebbiolo has been held back by excessively high yields. In Europe, there are some plantings in the Austrian region of Mittelburgenland. In South Africa, the first clones were imported in 1910 by Abraham Izak Perold but was not cultivated as a single varietal until the 1990s and there has been fewer than 25 hectares being recorded in 2016.

==Wines==
Wines made from Nebbiolo are characterized by their ample amounts of acidity and tannin. Most examples are wines built for ageing and some of the highest quality vintages need significant age (at least a decade or more) before they are palatable to many wine drinkers and can continue to improve in the bottle for upward of 30 years. As Nebbiolo ages, the bouquet becomes more complex and appealing with aromas of tar and roses being the two most common notes. Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, licorice, mulberries, spice as well dried and fresh herbs. While Barolo &amp; Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of ageing, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age. Lighter styles from Carema, Langhe and Gattinara tend to be ready to drink within a few years of vintage. Nebbiolo from California and Australia will vary from producer and quality of vineyard.

==Synonyms==

Nebbiolo has a wide range of synonyms used in various local districts of northwest Italy. In the areas of Novara and Vercelli it is known widely as Spanna. In the Val d&#x27;Aosta region and around Carema it is known as Picutener. In Valtellina it is known as Chiavennasca.
The Nebbiolo grape variety is also known under the name Barbesino, Brunenta, Femmina, Lampia, Marchesana, Martesana Melasca, Melaschetto, Melascone, Michet, Monferrina, Morsano di Caraglio, Nebbieul grosso, Nebbieul Maschio, Nebbiolin, Nebbiolin Canavesano, Nebbiolin lungo, Nebbiolin nero, Nebieu, Nebieul, Nebieul fumela, Nebiolo, Nebiolo du Piedmont, Nibieul burghin, Nibio, Nibiol, Nubiola, Pantin, Picot, Picotendre, Picotendro, Picote, Picotenero, Picoultener, Picoutendro Maschio, Počte, Prugnet, Prunent, Prunenta, Pugnet, Rosetta, Spagna, Span, Spana commune, Spana grossa and Uva Spanna.

<text>HMAS &quot;Horsham&quot; (J235/M235), named for the city of Horsham, Victoria, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Horsham&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Horsham&quot; was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Melbourne, Victoria on 26 June 1941. She was launched on 16 May 1942, and was commissioned into the RAN on 18 November 1942.

==Operational history==
&quot;Horsham&quot; entered active service in January 1943. She was initially assigned to Fremantle as an anti-submarine patrol ship, where she remained until August 1944. The corvette was then deployed to Darwin as a survey ship, and remained there until the end of World War II. In September 1945, &quot;Horsham&quot; was present at the Japanese surrender of Timor. She continued in the survey role until November 1945, when she returned to Fremantle.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Horsham&quot; paid off into reserve in Fremantle on 17 December 1945. She was sold for scrapping to the Hong Kong Delta Shipping Company on 8 August 1956.

<text>A snaphance or snaphaunce is a type of firearm lock in which a flint struck against a striker plate above a steel pan ignites the priming powder which fires the gun. It is the mechanical progression of the wheellock firing mechanism, and along with the miquelet lock and doglock are predecessors of the flintlock mechanism. 

The name is Dutch in origin but the mechanism cannot be attributed to the Netherlands with certainty.

Examples of this firearm can be found in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.

== Design ==

Like the earlier snaplock and later flintlock, the snaphance drives flint onto steel to create a shower of sparks to ignite the priming powder in the pan, the flash partly passing through the touch hole into the barrel where it ignites the main charge (propellant).

The flint is held in a clamp at the end of a bent lever called the cock. Upon pulling the trigger, this moves forward under the pressure of a strong spring and strikes a curved plate of hardened steel (called simply the steel, or in 17th century English dialect the frizzen) to produce a shower of sparks (actually white-hot steel shavings). These fall into a flash pan holding priming powder. The flash from the pan travels through the touch hole to cause the main charge of gunpowder to explode. The steel is at the end of an arm that can be moved independently of the pan cover.

The snaphance first appeared in the late 1550s as an improvement of the earlier snaplock in one or more of the following countries: Spain, Holland, Germany, Scotland, or Sweden. The main improvement was that the pan-cover opened automatically (to keep the priming dry until the exact moment of firing), as in the wheel-lock. (The snaplock had a manually operated pan cover similar to that of the matchlock. Some definitions class the snaphaunce as a sub-type of snaplock.) Also like the wheel-lock, the snaphance used a lateral sear mechanism to connect the trigger to cock. Later models had a variety of safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge of the gun. Without these the weapons, like any firearm, could be highly dangerous: Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Voyages&quot; records the death of one of the men on Cavendish&#x27;s circumnavigation in the 1580s due to an accidental discharge during a hurried re-embarkation on the coast of Ecuador, specifically mentioning the weapon was a snaphance. The snaphaunce has a form of safety built into its design, since the steel (frizzen) could be manually moved forward so that if the cock should be released accidentally it would not strike sparks. This led to an inherent disadvantage: in the flintlock when at half-cock and the frizzen is closed, the flint is in close proximity to the steel and can easily be adjusted to strike square to and in the center of the steel; in the snaphaunce the cock can only be at full-cock or down, where it prevents the steel from being brought back to the firing position, so the flint is more difficult to align. The development of the snaphance occurred separately but at the same time as the creation of the miquelet.

== Use ==
The snaphance was used from the mid-16th century, most commonly in pistol form as a weapon for officers and cavalry. It was used alongside the inferior wheellock in the 16th and 17th centuries, with different countries favoring different mechanisms. James Turners&#x27; &quot;Pallas Armata&quot;, written in the 1630s, noted that the snaphance (and other flintlocks) reigned supreme among cavalry in France, Britain, and the Dutch Republic, while the wheellock was still more common in the German lands: &quot;The French use locks with half bends (snaphaunces), and so do for the most part the English and Scots; the Germans rore or wheel-locks; the Hollanders make use of both.&quot;

Fragility, complexity, and cost kept it from replacing the matchlock in the hands of infantry, though the latter issue became less prominent as technology improved. By 1645 a matchlock musket cost 10 shillings in Britain compared to 15 shillings for a flintlock musket. However, flintlocks were still much cheaper than wheellocks; in 1631 the Royal Armoury&#x27;s purchase records show the going rate as 3 pounds (60 shillings) for a pair of wheellock pistols versus 2 pounds (40 shillings) for a pair of flintlock pistols.

The Dutch Snaphance originated in the Netherlands in 1650. It exemplified early flintlock pistols in that it was clumsy and inelegant and also difficult to carry about the user&#x27;s person. These weapons were useful for cavalrymen, however, who might carry two, four or even more loaded pistols into action.
By about 1680, it was gradually superseded and was still occasionally issued to reinforcements for Portugal for the British Army in the Wars of the Spanish Succession of 1703 and in Northern Italy where it was still in use until the 1750s. In Europe, and especially France, the snaphance was replaced by the flintlock with its combined steel/pan cover starting from about 1620. In England, a hybrid mechanism called the English Lock replaced the snaphance from the same date. Both the flintlock and the English lock were cheaper and less complex than the snaphance.
The snaphance dominated the New England gun market until it fell out of favor in the middle of the 17th century. Virginia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut outlawed the outdated mechanism by the late 17th century.

== Name ==
The origin of the name &quot;snaphance&quot; is thought to come from the Dutch , which roughly means &quot;pecking rooster&quot; and relates to the shape of the mechanism and its downward-darting action (and would also explain the name &quot;cock&quot; for the beak-shaped mechanism which holds the flint). In German, the calque &quot;Schnapphahn&quot; moved away from the earlier definitions and has traditionally referred to a mounted highwayman, who would have been likely to use a firearm of that nature. The French &quot;chenapan&quot; also changed its meaning in the seventeenth century to define a rogue or scoundrel. During the Second Northern and Scanian Wars, a &quot;Snapphane&quot; was a pro-Danish Guerilla-man in Scania, which had just been annexed by Sweden, as they wanted to belong to Denmark instead.

In Swedish the word &quot;Snapphane&quot; is first recorded 1558 in a letter from King Gustav I to his son Duke John of Finland &quot;reffvelske snaphaner&quot; (Snapphanar from Tallinn-Reval), earlier correspondence were discussing Estonian privateers and problems created by them in Russian commerce. In the inventories of the Royal Armoury in Stockholm the term &quot;snapphanelås&quot; (&quot;snaphance lock&quot;) appears first in 1730, after the conquest of the former Danish provinces of Skåne, Halland and Blekinge in the 1670s. The local peasant warriors were then called snapphanar and their typical smallbore rifles (see picture) were described as having &quot;snapphanelås&quot;: locks or rifles used by the Snapphanar. In the earlier inventories the term used is always &quot;snapplås&quot; (&quot;snaplock&quot;).

<doc id="452599" wikidata="Q512882" url="?curid=452599" title="Joseph Howe">
<text>Joseph Howe (December 13, 1804 – June 1, 1873) was a Nova Scotian journalist, politician, public servant, and poet. Howe is often ranked as one of Nova Scotia&#x27;s most admired politicians and his considerable skills as a journalist and writer have made him a provincial legend.

He was born the son of John Howe and Mary Edes at Halifax and inherited from his loyalist father an undying love for Great Britain and her Empire. At age 23, the self-taught but widely read Howe purchased the &quot;Novascotian&quot;, soon making it into a popular and influential newspaper. He reported extensively on debates in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly and travelled to every part of the province writing about its geography and people.
In 1835, Howe was charged with seditious libel, a serious criminal offence, after the &quot;Novascotian&quot; published a letter attacking Halifax politicians and police for pocketing public money. Howe addressed the jury for more than six hours, citing numerous examples of civic corruption. The judge called for Howe&#x27;s conviction, but swayed by his passionate address, jurors acquitted him in what is considered a landmark case in the struggle for a free press in Canada.

The next year, Howe was elected to the assembly as a liberal reformer, beginning a long and eventful public career. He was instrumental in helping Nova Scotia become the first British colony to win responsible government in 1848. He served as premier of Nova Scotia from 1860 to 1863 and led the unsuccessful fight against Canadian Confederation from 1866 to 1868. Having failed to persuade the British to repeal Confederation, Howe joined the federal cabinet of John A. Macdonald in 1869 and played a major role in bringing Manitoba into the union. Howe became the third Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia in 1873, but died after only three weeks in office.

==Early life==
The Howe family was of Puritan stock from Massachusetts. Having remained loyal to the crown during the American Revolution, the family of John Howe joined the flood of United Empire Loyalists out of the United States after the American revolutionaries succeeded in their claims of independence. John Howe arrived at Halifax in 1779 and set up a printing shop, where he published the first issue of the &quot;Halifax Journal&quot; in December 1780. In 1801, Howe was rewarded for his loyalty by appointment as the King&#x27;s Printer and in 1803 he became deputy postmaster for Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.

In 1798, John Howe in married Mary Edes; their son Joseph was born at Halifax on December 13, 1804. Joseph was John&#x27;s eighth child and Mary&#x27;s second. John&#x27;s first wife, Martha Minn, died from complications following childbirth.

Like many lads of that time, Joseph Howe attended the Royal Acadian School before beginning an apprenticeship, which he served at his father&#x27;s printing shop starting at the age of 23. He married Catherine Ann Susan McNab on February 2, 1828.

That same year he went into the printing business himself with the purchase of the &quot;Nova Scotian&quot;, a Halifax newspaper. Howe acted as its editor until 1841, turning the paper into the most influential in the province. Not only did he personally report the legislative assembly debates in its columns, he also published provincial literature and his own travel writings, using the paper as a means for educating the people of Nova Scotia, and himself. &quot;His name ranks as perhaps the greatest in Canadian journalism.&quot;

==Libel trial==
On January 1, 1835, Howe&#x27;s &quot;Novascotian&quot; published an anonymous letter accusing Halifax politicians and police of pocketing £30,000 over a thirty-year period. The outraged civic politicians had Howe charged with seditious libel, a serious criminal offence. Howe&#x27;s case seemed hopeless since truth was not a defence. The prosecution had only to prove that Howe had published the letter. Howe decided to act as his own lawyer. For more than five hours, he addressed the jury, citing case after case of civic corruption. He spoke eloquently about the importance of press freedom, urging jurors &quot;to leave an unshackled press as a legacy to your children.&quot; Even though the judge instructed the jury to find Howe guilty, jurors took only 10 minutes to acquit him. The decision was a landmark event in the slow evolution of press freedom in Canada.

Brenton Halliburton presided over the Libel trial of Joseph Howe. The outcome of the trial and Howe&#x27;s writings in the Novascotian so enraged Haliburton&#x27;s son John C. Halliburton that the son called Howe out for a duel. The duel took place on March 14, 1840, at Point Pleasant. When Haliburton missed with his shot, Howe &quot;deloped&quot; deliberately missing by firing his gun in the air. (The last lethal duel in Nova Scotia took place in 1819, in which William Bowie was killed.)

==Political career==
Eventually, Howe decided to run for office in order to effect the changes he championed in his newspaper. He was first elected in 1836, campaigning on a platform of support for responsible government. Howe initially proposed only an elected legislative council but he was quick to agree with the concept of a fully representative government. He was suspicious of formal political parties feeling that they were too restrictive. It was, however, largely his doing that members favouring Liberal principles were able to dominate assembly from 1836 to 1840. He formed a coalition with Conservative leader James William Johnston in 1840 hoping to further the cause of responsible government. Howe held the office of Speaker of the assembly in 1841 and collector of excise for Halifax in 1842.

The coalition collapsed under various political conflicts, leading to Howe&#x27;s resignation from the Council in 1843. The promotion of political ideas in his newspapers were rewarded with a seven-seat Liberal majority in the 1847 election. This led to the formation of the first responsible government in Canada in January 1848. While James Uniacke was officially the Premier, many regarded it as Joseph Howe&#x27;s ministry. Howe assumed the post of Provincial Secretary, adapting existing institutions to the new system of government. He also began a campaign of railway construction, resigning as Provincial Secretary in 1853 to become Nova Scotia&#x27;s first Chief Commissioner of Railways; as Commissioner he oversaw the initial construction of the Nova Scotia Railway. In addition, Howe was involved with recruiting American troops for the Crimean War. These activities left him with little time to campaign in the 1855 general election which he lost to Charles Tupper in Cumberland. This election also led to conflict with Catholic members of the Liberal party because Howe had ridiculed their religious doctrine. This resulted in a Liberal defeat in 1856. The Liberals did not return to power until 1860 at which time Howe became provincial secretary. When the Premier, William Young, was appointed as a judge later that year, Joseph Howe assumed the leadership of the party and therefore became Premier. He served as Premier until 1863 when he accepted the position of Imperial Fisheries Commissioner.

==Confederation debate==
Howe&#x27;s fisheries duties prevented his attendance at the Charlottetown Conference. By the time he returned to Nova Scotia in November 1864, the Quebec Conference had taken place, and the Quebec Resolutions widely disseminated. He had no chance to influence their content. He led Nova Scotia&#x27;s anti-Confederation movement believing the Quebec Resolutions to be bad for the province. Because he was still linked with the imperial fishery he expressed his initial opposition anonymously through the &quot;Botheration Letters&quot;, a series of 12 editorials that appeared in the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; between January and March 1865. This was the extent of his participation in the union debate until March 1866. He learned that Charles Tupper planned to force the Confederation Resolution through the legislature. When he failed to prevent passage of the resolution Howe began a vigorous campaign for repeal by delegations to London and then publishing a variety of anti-Confederation papers and pamphlets. This strategy failed to prevent the Imperial Parliament enacting the British North America Act in 1867. Nova Scotians elected 18 out of 19 anti-Confederation candidates as members of the first Dominion Parliament. Joseph Howe led the anti-Confederates in the House of Commons of Canada where he made a speech about his opposition to confederation.

Having failed to win repeal of Confederation in 1868, Howe recognized the futility of further protests. He refused to contemplate secession from the Canadian Confederation nor American annexation because of his loyalty to Britain. He ran in the great Hants County by election of 1869 to create better terms for Nova Scotia within Canada rather than continue to seek repeal of Confederation. The Great Hants Campaign of 1869 was very difficult and compromised Howe&#x27;s physical health. Many Nova Scotians continued to support the anti-confederation efforts but the Hants County electorate continued to support Joseph Howe.

In 1869 Howe joined the Canadian Cabinet as President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada after receiving a promise of &quot;better terms&quot; for Nova Scotia. In November 1869, he became secretary of state for the provinces in which post he played a role in Manitoba&#x27;s entry into Confederation. He resigned his Cabinet post to become the 3rd Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia post Confederation in 1873. He died in office only a few weeks after his appointment. He is buried in Camp Hill Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

==Railway promotion==

In 1854, he resigned as the provincial secretary in order to head a bi-partisan railway commission. Due to the cost of the project, it was never fully completed. However, Howe was successful in completing lines from Halifax to Windsor. This railway enabled Halifax to monopolize the trade of Minas Basin because it passed through the land between Halifax and Hants County. This wealth helped the midland counties improve their economic stability. Due to the economic benefits being realized in Halifax, Howe even proposed the creation of a hotel to attract wealthy travellers using the railway, however this was never built.

==Poetry==
Howe created a substantial body of poetry, much of it related to his appreciation of Nova Scotia and its history. While he had published some poems during his life and had been preparing others for publication, it was not until a year after his death that his family made them public through the publishing of &quot;Poems and Essays&quot;.

==Family==
Prior to his marriage, Howe had a son by a woman other than his later wife, whose identity is unknown. This first child was Edward Howe, who lived with his mother in a home Howe maintained in Maitland, Nova Scotia.

Joseph Howe later married Catherine Susan Ann McNab, daughter of Captain John McNab, Nova Scotia Regiment of Fencible Infantry, on February 2, 1828. She was born in 1808 in the barracks at the entrance to the harbour of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, where her father was in command of the troops. She lived with her father on McNab&#x27;s Island, which had previously been occupied by her uncle, Peter McNab. In Joseph Howe&#x27;s &quot;Poems and Essays&quot; (Montreal: 1874), there are two poems addressed to his wife. Towards the close of her life, the Legislature of Nova Scotia granted her a small pension. She died in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, July 6, 1890, and is buried alongside her husband in Camp Hill Cemetery, Halifax.

Joseph Howe had ten children with Catherine Susan Ann McNab.

Sydenham and Fanny had 4 sons and 2 daughters.
* John Howe: b. 16 May 1864(?), d. 20 June 1856 (birth year in source article is a clear typographical error as it states that he was born in 1864, yet his information appears before William Howe who was born 1848, and he is stated to have died in 1856, therefore the likely year of his birth was 1844), if his birth was in 1844, then he died at the age of 12 years.
* William Howe: b. 27 July 1848, 1st m. 23 Sep 1873 to Helen F. Ross (daughter of Rev. Principal James Ross, D.D.). William and Helen had two daughters. Second marriage 4 Mar 1884 to Maggie Clark (daughter of Robert Clark of Ottawa), no issue. William died 28 Apr 1890, aged 41.

<doc id="452601" wikidata="Q2420611" url="?curid=452601" title="French aircraft carrier Arromanches">
<text>Arromanches (R95) was an aircraft carrier of the French Navy, which served from 1946 to 1974. She was previously HMS &quot;Colossus&quot; (15) of the Royal Navy. She was the name-ship of the &quot;Colossus&quot; class of light carriers. She was commissioned in 1944, but did not see any action in World War II. She served with the British Pacific Fleet in 1945–46, as an aircraft transport and repatriation ship.

In 1946, she was loaned to the French Navy, and renamed &quot;Arromanches&quot;; she was bought by the French in 1951.

&quot;Arromanches&quot; participated in the First Indochina War in three campaigns from 1948 to 1954, and the Suez Crisis of 1956. In 1968 she was converted to an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) carrier. She was decommissioned in 1974, and broken up in 1978.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Colossus&quot; class was designed to meet the Royal Navy&#x27;s wartime need for more carriers as cheaply as possible. They were built to mercantile standards, with no armour, no heavy AA guns, and only speed.
&quot;Colossus&quot; was ordered on 14 March 1942 under Admiralty Job Number J 4576, one of three &quot;Colossus&quot;-class carriers ordered that day. The ship was laid down at Vickers-Armstrongs&#x27; High Walker shipyard on 1 June 1942 with the Yard number 55 and was launched on 30 September 1943. &quot;Colossus&quot; was formally commissioned on 1 December 1944, being completed and handed over to the Royal Navy on 16 December 1944.

==Weapons and systems==

=== Radars===
In 1947 she had for air scanning only, one 79B, for air and surface scanning, one 277 and one 281B. With those she also had a target indicator, a 293. Then in 1954 she still had in her possession a 281B for air and surface scanning a 291B and a 277. &quot;Arromanches&quot; also still had a 293 as her target indicator. Still for air scanning only she had the 79B, but she also gained later that year a YE and for navigation a DRBN-30. In 1959 she was down-graded and only had a YE in her possession left. That year she gained new scanning equipment. She had a DRBV-22 for air scanning and for surface scanning and navigation a new DRBV-31. And finally in 1972 she was fully downgraded and had her YE removed, but kept her DRBV-22 and DRBV-31 for air, surface, and navigation.

===Armament===

====Weaponry====

During her time in military service she had twenty-four Vickers-Armstrongs 2-pounder guns, thirty-two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon, later replaced in 1945 by twenty-one Bofors 40 mm guns and four Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers guns.

====Aircraft====

During her service with France before 1968 she carried the Breguet Br-1050 Alizé, the Vought F4U-7 Corsair, the Grumman F6F-5 Hellcat, the Fouga CM-175 Zéphyr, the Curtiss SB2C-5 Helldiver, the Douglas SBD-5 Dauntless, the SNCASE Aquilon, the Supermarine Seafire Mk III and XV, and the Grumman TBM Avenger. After 1968, she was converted to a helicopter carrier and carried the Alouette II and Alouette III, the Sikorsky S-51, Sikorsky S-55, and Sikorsky S-58, the Piasecki H-21 and Piasecki H-25, and the Morane-Saulnier MS-500 Criquet.

===Aeronautical installations===
The carrier had a regular flight deck , catapult at the bow of the ship, two lifts (13.72 m x 10.36 m wide), and a hangar (104.24 × 15.85 m wide) fitted (in 1964) to accommodate 13 TBMs, 2 HUP-2s or 15 F4Us and 2 HUP-2.

===Manning===
As &quot;Colossus&quot;, she carried 854 crew, plus 222 Fleet Air Arm personnel in the air group.

In French service, she carried 42 officers, 145 petty officers, and 516 sailors in peacetime. Her war complement was 60 officers, 171 petty officers, and 613 sailors.

==Operational history==

=== Royal Navy===

After working up &quot;Colossus&quot; left Glasgow on 12 March 1945 for the Far East. She carried 24 Vought Corsair IV fighters from 1846 Naval Air Squadron, and 18 Fairey Barracuda II torpedo bombers from 827 NAS. She arrived at Colombo, Ceylon, on 13 June 1945, sailing on to Sydney, Australia, where she arrived the following month. Here, her 20 mm Oerlikon guns were replaced by 40 mm Bofors guns. In August she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Cecil Harcourt, commanding the 11th Aircraft Carrier Squadron (&quot;Colossus&quot;, , , and ). This force was sent to re-occupy Hong Kong. &quot;Colossus&quot; also headed a task force to occupy Shanghai, together with the cruisers and and five destroyers. In December 1945, &quot;Colossus&quot; transported released Dutch prisoners of war to Colombo. From 17 January to 26 March 1946, &quot;Colossus&quot; was refitted and repaired at Cape Town in the Selborne drydock at Simonstown.

===French Navy===

In August 1946 &quot;Colossus&quot; was loaned to France and renamed &quot;Arromanches&quot;, after the French commune of the same name, which was the site of the British D-Day landings. In 1948, &quot;Arromanches&quot; participated in the First Indochina War for three months. She returned to France in 1949. In 1951, France purchased the ship. She was again deployed to Indochina in 1951–52, in 1952-53 and 1953–54.

In 1956, &quot;Arromanches&quot; was deployed to the eastern Mediterranean Sea during the Suez Crisis. On 3 November, 18 F4U Corsairs from &quot;Arromanches&quot; and bombed Egyptian airfields around Cairo.

In 1957–58 &quot;Arromanches&quot; was reconstructed with a four-degree angled flight deck, a mirror landing sight
and with other modifications for anti-submarine warfare, including operation of Breguet Alizé ASW aircraft. She was also equipped for training operations. In 1959 she returned once again to the Indian Ocean.

In 1968 &quot;Arromanches&quot; was converted to a helicopter carrier for the French Marines, with up to 24 helicopters on board. This ended her role as a training carrier.

&quot;Arromanches&quot; was decommissioned on 22 January 1974, and in 1978 broken up at Toulon, a place of importance for both the first &quot;Colossus&quot; in 1793, and the last in 1978.

<text>Grigol Robakidze () (October 28, 1880, Sviri, Kutaisi Governorate – November 19, 1962, Geneva) was a Georgian writer, publicist, and public figure primarily known for his prose and anti-Soviet émigré activities.

==Biography==
He was born on October 28, 1880, in the village of Sviri, Imereti (west Georgia). After the graduation from Kutaisi Classical Gymnasium (1900), he took courses at the University of Tartu (Estonia) and the University of Leipzig (Germany). Robakidze returned from Germany in 1908, and gradually became a leading person among the young Georgian symbolists. In 1915, he founded and led the &quot;Blue Horns&quot;, a new group of symbolist poets and writers which would later play an important role, particularly during the next two decades. Heavily influenced by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, his prose centered &quot;on the search of mythological archetypes and their realisation in the life of a nation, and although its intrigue is always artificial and displays much of pose, he was highly respected both by his compatriots and a number of important European literary figures, such as Stefan Zweig and Nikos Kazantzakis.&quot; In 1917, he played a role in founding of the Union of Georgian Writers. He was involved in the national liberation movement of Georgia of 1914–1918. Robakidze got a diplomatic post in 1919, when he took part in the Paris Peace Conference as an executive secretary of the state delegation of the Democratic Republic of Georgia.

After annexation of Georgia by Soviet Russia in 1921, he remained in the country, but was known for his anti-Soviet sentiments. His famous play &quot;Lamara&quot; was staged by the leading Georgian director Sandro Akhmeteli in 1930, a performance which became a prize-winner at the 1930 Moscow Drama Olympiad.

Robakidze and his wife defected to Germany the same year. Despite Lavrenti Beria&#x27;s objections, they had secured exit visas, ostensibly to supervise the translation of his works into German, and had decided not to return. This hardened Beria&#x27;s resolve to deal with the rest of the Blue Horns. &quot;Lamara&quot; continued to be staged to prove the achievements of Soviet theatrical art, although without the name of the playwright being announced. His defection, along with Vladimir Mayakovsky&#x27;s suicide, silenced most of his fellow poets for a long while. As an émigré, Robakidze had a rather unhappy life.

During World War II, he participated in the right-wing patriotic émigré organizations such as the Committee of Independence of Georgia (1941), the Union of Georgian Traditionalists (1942) and Tetri Giorgi. After the war, his two books on Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler were believed to favour Nazism. Famous representatives of the Georgian political emigration rejected this claim.

He died a broken man in Geneva on November 19, 1962. He was later reburied in the Cemetery of Leuville-sur-Orge, France, a burial ground of the Georgian emigration to Europe.

== Grigol Robakidze&#x27;s Links to Kurban Said ==

In her book &quot;Ali and Nino – Literary Robbery!&quot;, Tamar Injia claims that &quot;Ali and Nino: A Love Story&quot; by Kurban Said (Austria, 1937) is extensively plagiarized from, and owes much of its existence to &quot;The Snake&#x27;s Skin&quot; by Grigol Robakidze (Germany, 1928). By comparing passages from both novels (35 comprehensive extracts), the author argues that sections from &quot;Ali and Nino: A Love Story&quot; are copied from &quot;The Snake&#x27;s Skin&quot;. Additionally, by analyzing the literal parallels in both novels, the author shows &quot;side-by-side&quot; similarities in content, namely repeated stories, myths, legends, characters and plot structures. The specific passages in question relate to excursions that Ali and Nino made to Tbilisi and to Iran.

Injia&#x27;s research findings were first published in a series of articles in the Georgian newspaper &quot;Our Literature&quot; (2003) and later printed as books &quot;Grigol Robakidze… Kurban Said – Literary Robbery&quot; (2005) in Georgian and &quot;Ali and Nino – Literary Robbery!&quot; (2009) in English.

The findings of Injia were supported and shared by the representatives from various literary circles, scholars and researchers from Georgia and the US: Gia Papuashvili – documentary movie producer and philologist; Levan Bregadze – German linguist, Georgian literary critic and philologist; Zaza Alexidze – former Director of the Georgian National Center of Manuscripts, and discoverer and decipherer of the Caucasian Albanian written script; Betty Blair – researcher of authorship of &quot;Ali and Nino: A Love Story&quot; and founding editor of magazine Azerbaijan International.

It has many uses, including but not limited to: procedurally generating terrain, applying pseudo-random changes to a variable, and assisting in the creation of image textures. It is most commonly implemented in two, three, or four dimensions, but can be defined for any number of dimensions.

==History ==

Ken Perlin developed Perlin noise in 1983 as a result of his frustration with the &quot;machine-like&quot; look of computer-generated imagery (CGI) at the time. He formally described his findings in a SIGGRAPH paper in 1985 called &quot;An Image Synthesizer&quot;. He developed it after working on Disney&#x27;s computer animated sci-fi motion picture &quot;Tron&quot; (1982) for the animation company Mathematical Applications Group (MAGI). In 1997, Perlin was awarded an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for creating the algorithm, the citation for which read:
Perlin did not apply for any patents on the algorithm, but in 2001 he was granted a patent for the use of 3D+ implementations of simplex noise for texture synthesis. Simplex noise has the same purpose, but uses a simpler space-filling grid. Simplex noise alleviates some of the problems with Perlin&#x27;s &quot;classic noise&quot;, among them computational complexity and visually-significant directional artifacts.

==Uses==

Perlin noise is a procedural texture primitive, a type of gradient noise used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in computer graphics. The function has a pseudo-random appearance, yet all of its visual details are the same size. This property allows it to be readily controllable; multiple scaled copies of Perlin noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a great variety of procedural textures. Synthetic textures using Perlin noise are often used in CGI to make computer-generated visual elementssuch as object surfaces, fire, smoke, or cloudsappear more natural, by imitating the controlled random appearance of textures in nature.
It is also frequently used to generate textures when memory is extremely limited, such as in demos. Its successors, such as fractal noise and simplex noise, have become nearly ubiquitous in graphics processing units both for real-time graphics and for non-real-time procedural textures in all kinds of computer graphics.

It is frequently used in video games to make procedurally generated terrain that looks natural. This success is in part due to the hierarchical structuring of Perlin noise that mimics naturally occurring hierarchical structures, and therefore also has found to be useful in environmental science applications.

==Algorithm detail==

Perlin noise is most commonly implemented as a two-, three- or four-dimensional function, but can be defined for any number of dimensions. An implementation typically involves three steps: defining a grid of random gradient vectors, computing the dot product between the gradient vectors and their offsets, and interpolation between these values. 

===Grid definition===

Define an -dimensional grid where each grid intersection has associated with it a fixed random -dimensional unit-length gradient vector, except in the one dimensional case where the gradients are random scalars between −1 and 1.

===Dot product===
For working out the value of any candidate point, first find the unique grid cell in which the point lies. Then, identify the corners of that cell and their associated gradient vectors. Next, for each corner, calculate an offset vector. An offset vector is a displacement vector from that corner to the candidate point.

For each corner, we take the dot product between its gradient vector and the offset vector to the candidate point. This dot product will be zero if the candidate point is exactly at the grid corner.

For a point in a two-dimensional grid, this will require the computation of four offset vectors and dot products, while in three dimensions it will require eight offset vectors and eight dot products. In general, the algorithm has complexity in dimensions.

===Interpolation===

The final step is interpolation between the dot products. Interpolation is performed using a function that has zero first derivative (and possibly also second derivative) at the grid nodes. Therefore, at points close to the grid nodes, the output will approximate the dot product of the gradient vector of the node and the offset vector to the node. This means that the noise function will pass through 0 at every node, giving Perlin noise its characteristic look.

If , an example of a function that interpolates between value at grid node 0 and value at grid node 1 is

:formula_1

where the smoothstep function was used.

Noise functions for use in computer graphics typically produce values in the range and can be scaled accordingly.

==Gradient Permutation==
In Ken Perlin&#x27;s original implementation he used a simple hashing scheme to determine what gradient vector is associated with each grid intersection. A pre-computed permutation table is used to turn a given grid coordinate into a random number. The original implementation worked on a 256 node grid and so included the following permutation table:
int permutation[] = { 151, 160, 137, 91, 90, 15, 131, 13, 201, 95, 96, 53, 194, 233, 7, 225,
 140, 36, 103, 30, 69, 142, 8, 99, 37, 240, 21, 10, 23, 190, 6, 148,
 247, 120, 234, 75, 0, 26, 197, 62, 94, 252, 219, 203, 117, 35, 11, 32,
 57, 177, 33, 88, 237, 149, 56, 87, 174, 20, 125, 136, 171, 168, 68, 175,
 74, 165, 71, 134, 139, 48, 27, 166, 77, 146, 158, 231, 83, 111, 229, 122,
 60, 211, 133, 230, 220, 105, 92, 41, 55, 46, 245, 40, 244, 102, 143, 54,
 65, 25, 63, 161, 1, 216, 80, 73, 209, 76, 132, 187, 208, 89, 18, 169,
 200, 196, 135, 130, 116, 188, 159, 86, 164, 100, 109, 198, 173, 186, 3, 64,
 52, 217, 226, 250, 124, 123, 5, 202, 38, 147, 118, 126, 255, 82, 85, 212,
 207, 206, 59, 227, 47, 16, 58, 17, 182, 189, 28, 42, 223, 183, 170, 213,
 119, 248, 152, 2, 44, 154, 163, 70, 221, 153, 101, 155, 167, 43, 172, 9,
 129, 22, 39, 253, 19, 98, 108, 110, 79, 113, 224, 232, 178, 185, 112, 104,
 218, 246, 97, 228, 251, 34, 242, 193, 238, 210, 144, 12, 191, 179, 162, 241,
 81, 51, 145, 235, 249, 14, 239, 107, 49, 192, 214, 31, 181, 199, 106, 157,
 184, 84, 204, 176, 115, 121, 50, 45, 127, 4, 150, 254, 138, 236, 205, 93,
 222, 114, 67, 29, 24, 72, 243, 141, 128, 195, 78, 66, 215, 61, 156, 180 };
This specific permutation is not absolutely required, though it does require a randomized array of the integers 0 to 255. If creating a new permutation table, care should be taken to ensure uniform distribution of the values.

To get a gradient vector using the permutation table the coordinates of a grid point are looked up sequentially in the permutation table adding the value of each coordinate to the permutation of the previous coordinate. So for example the original implementation did this in 3D as follows:
// Values above 255 were handled by repeating the permutation table twice.
static final int p[] = new int[512];
static { for (int i=0; i &lt; 256 ; i++) p[256+i] = p[i] = permutation[i]; }

int hash = p[p[p[X] + Y] + Z];
The algorithm then looks at the bottom 4 bits of the hash output to pick 1 of 12 gradient vectors for that grid point.
==Complexity==
For each evaluation of the noise function, the dot product of the position and gradient vectors must be evaluated at each node of the containing grid cell. Perlin noise therefore scales with complexity  for dimensions. Alternatives to Perlin noise producing similar results with improved complexity scaling include simplex noise and OpenSimplex noise.

<text>HMS &quot;Colossus&quot; was the lead ship of her class of two dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy at the end of the first decade of the 20th century. She spent her whole career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, often serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea. &quot;Colossus&quot; was the only dreadnought from the main body of the Grand Fleet to be hit during the Battle of Jutland, although she suffered only minor damage. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war and was reduced to reserve and then became a training ship. &quot;Colossus&quot; was hulked in 1923 and sold for scrap in 1928.

==Design and description==
The design of the &quot;Colossus&quot; class was derived from that of the earlier with redistributed armour and more powerful torpedoes. &quot;Colossus&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. In 1911 her crew numbered 751 officers and ratings.
&quot;Colossus&quot; was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two shafts, using steam from eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her full-power, eight-hour sea trials on 30 March 1911, she reached a top speed of from in a moderate storm. The &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armament and armour===
The &quot;Colossus&quot; class was equipped with ten breech-loading (BL) Mark XI guns in five hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets, three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing turrets. The centreline turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27;, from front to rear, and the port and starboard wing turrets were &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; respectively. Their secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mark VII guns. Ten of these were mounted in the forward superstructure and six in the aft superstructure in single mounts. Four 3-pounder () saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch (533 mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 18 torpedoes were provided.

They had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was thick between the fore and aftmost barbettes that did not cover the full length of the ships. Above this was a strake of armour. The forward oblique 4-inch bulkheads connected the forward barbette to the side armour. Similarly, the aft bulkhead connected them to the rearmost barbette, although it was 8 inches thick. The three centreline barbettes were protected by armour thick above the main deck and thinned to 4 inches below it. The wing barbettes were similar except that they had 11 inches of armour on their outer faces. The gun turrets had 11-inch faces and sides with roofs.

The three armoured decks ranged in thickness from with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the rear and roof were 8 inches and 3 inches thick respectively. The torpedo control tower aft had 3-inch sides and a 2-inch roof. In an effort to reduce weight, the &quot;Colossus&quot;-class ships reverted to the inadequate underwater protection scheme of and their anti-torpedo bulkheads only protected the shell rooms and magazines, although they had a maximum thickness of 3 inches.

====Modifications====
Sometime in 1912, the compass platform was extended forward to accommodate a rangefinder. After the start of the war in August 1914, a pair of 3-inch anti-aircraft (AA) guns were added. A fire-control director was installed on a platform below the spotting top before December 1915. Approximately of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916. Around the same time, four 4-inch guns were removed from the aft superstructure. By April 1917, &quot;Colossus&quot; was equipped with single 4-inch and 3-inch AA guns and the forward group of 4-inch guns had been enclosed in casemates. The stern torpedo tube was removed in 1917–1918 and a high-angle rangefinder was fitted on the spotting top in 1918. The AA guns were removed in 1919–1920 and some 4-inch guns were removed during her September–October 1921 refit. In addition, some machinery was removed during the refit to render her non-combat worthy in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Colossus&quot;, named after the Colossus of Rhodes, was the fifth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy (RN). The ship was ordered on 1 June 1909 and laid down at Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering at their shipyard in Greenock on 8 July. She was launched on 9 April 1910 and completed in July 1911 at the cost of £1,672,102, including her armament. The ship began trials on 28 February that lasted until July. &quot;Colossus&quot; commissioned at Devonport on 8 August and was assigned to the 2nd Division of the Home Fleet. This was redesignated as the 2nd Battle Squadron (BS) on 1 May 1912. The ship participated in the Parliamentary Naval Review on 9 July at Spithead and became the temporary flagship of the squadron while her sister ship, , was being refitted in November–December. During this time, she conducted gunnery practice off Portland at a range of , the longest shoot performed by any ship of the RN before the start of the war. Shortly afterwards, &quot;Colossus&quot; was transferred to the 1st BS. She visited Cherbourg, France, with part of the fleet in March 1913.

===World War I===

Between 17 and 20 July 1914, &quot;Colossus&quot; took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Arriving in Portland on 25 July, she was ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow four days later to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. While at Portland, two engineers were killed in an accident whilst coaling on 28 July. In August 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. Most of it was briefly based (22 October to 3 November) at Lough Swilly, Ireland, while the defences at Scapa were strengthened. On the evening of 22 November 1914, the Grand Fleet conducted a fruitless sweep in the southern half of the North Sea; &quot;Colossus&quot; stood with the main body in support of Vice-Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron. The fleet was back in port in Scapa Flow by 27 November. The 1st BS cruised north-west of the Shetland Islands and conducted gunnery practice on 8–12 December. Four days later, the Grand Fleet sortied during the German raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby, but failed to make contact with the High Seas Fleet. &quot;Colossus&quot; and the rest of the Grand Fleet conducted another sweep of the North Sea on 25–27 December.
Jellicoe&#x27;s ships, including &quot;Colossus&quot;, conducted gunnery drills on 10–13 January 1915 west of Orkney and Shetland. On the evening of 23 January, the bulk of the Grand Fleet sailed in support of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers, but &quot;Colossus&quot; and the rest of the fleet did not participate in the ensuing Battle of Dogger Bank the following day. On 7–10 March, the Grand Fleet conducted a sweep in the northern North Sea, during which it conducted training manoeuvres. Another such cruise took place on 16–19 March. On 11 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a patrol in the central North Sea and returned to port on 14 April; another patrol in the area took place on 17–19 April, followed by gunnery drills off Shetland on 20–21 April.

The Grand Fleet conducted sweeps into the central North Sea on 17–19 May and 29–31 May without encountering any German vessels. During 11–14 June, the fleet conducted gunnery practice and battle exercises west of Shetland and more training off Shetland beginning on 11 July. On 2–5 September, the fleet went on another cruise in the northern end of the North Sea and conducted gunnery drills. Throughout the rest of the month, the Grand Fleet conducted numerous training exercises. The ship, together with the majority of the Grand Fleet, conducted another sweep into the North Sea from 13 to 15 October. Almost three weeks later, &quot;Colossus&quot; participated in another fleet training operation west of Orkney during 2–5 November. Later that month, the ship became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Ernest Gaunt, commander of the 5th Division of the 1st BS.

The fleet departed for a cruise in the North Sea on 26 February 1916; Jellicoe had intended to use the Harwich Force to sweep the Heligoland Bight, but bad weather prevented operations in the southern North Sea. As a result, the operation was confined to the northern end of the sea. Another sweep began on 6 March, but had to be abandoned the following day as the weather grew too severe for the escorting destroyers. On the night of 25 March, &quot;Colossus&quot; and the rest of the fleet sailed from Scapa Flow to support Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers and other light forces raiding the German Zeppelin base at Tondern. By the time the Grand Fleet approached the area on 26 March, the British and German forces had already disengaged and a strong gale threatened the light craft, so the fleet was ordered to return to base. On 21 April, the Grand Fleet conducted a demonstration off Horns Reef to distract the Germans while the Imperial Russian Navy relaid its defensive minefields in the Baltic Sea. The fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 24 April and refuelled before proceeding south in response to intelligence reports that the Germans were about to launch a raid on Lowestoft, but only arrived in the area after the Germans had withdrawn. On 2–4 May, the fleet conducted another demonstration off Horns Reef to keep German attention focused on the North Sea.

====Battle of Jutland====
In an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the High Seas Fleet, composed of sixteen dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts and supporting ships, departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s five battlecruisers. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. In response the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totalling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.

On 31 May, &quot;Colossus&quot;, under the command of Captain Dudley Pound, was the lead ship of the 5th Division and was the seventeenth ship from the head of the battle line after deployment. During the first stage of the general engagement, the ship fired three salvos from her main guns at a barely visible battleship at 18:30. Shortly afterward, she fired four salvos at the crippled light cruiser around 18:32. &quot;Colossus&quot; fired another three salvos at &quot;Wiesbaden&quot; at 19:00 and switched to the destroyer , which was attempting to come to &quot;Wiesbaden&quot;″s assistance, five minutes later with both her main and secondary armament. The destroyer was not hit, but the detonations of the near misses caused her condensers to spring leaks, which gradually reduced her speed. About 19:10 &quot;Colossus&quot; engaged several German destroyer flotillas with her forward turret and 4-inch guns without result.
About 19:15, she engaged the battlecruiser at a range of only with five salvos of armour-piercing, capped (APC) shells. She claimed four hits, but likely made five on the German ship. Only two of these were significant, destroying a pair of guns, knocking out two others, and causing some flooding. In return she was struck by two shells fired by the battlecruiser at 19:16, but neither caused any significant damage, splinters igniting a few 4-inch propellant charges that were easily put out. Seven men, however, were wounded. A few minutes later, splinters from two near misses wrecked a searchlight and wounded two men. At 19:35, &quot;Colossus&quot; had to turn away from an approaching German torpedo. The ship did not fire her guns again and was not hit again, although her propellers were slightly damaged when she scraped over a wreck at 23:30. During the battle she fired a total of 93 twelve-inch shells (81 APC and 12 common pointed, capped) and 16 shells from her four-inch guns.

====Subsequent activity====
On 12 June, Gaunt and &quot;Colossus&quot; were transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron and Gaunt became the squadron&#x27;s second-in-command. The Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55° 30&#x27; North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions.
From June to September 1917, she was being refitted. In April 1918, the High Seas Fleet again sortied, to attack British convoys to Norway. They enforced strict wireless silence during the operation, which prevented Room 40 cryptanalysts from warning the new commander of the Grand Fleet, Admiral Beatty. The British only learned of the operation after an accident aboard the battlecruiser forced her to break radio silence to inform the German commander of her condition. Beatty then ordered the Grand Fleet to sea to intercept the Germans, but he was not able to reach the High Seas Fleet before it turned back for Germany. The ship was present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered there on 21 November. In January 1919, she became flagship of the Reserve Fleet at Devonport. In March, &quot;Colossus&quot; briefly became flagship of the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet, before that role was transferred to the dreadnought on 18 March. On 30 June 1921, she was listed for disposal, but become a boys&#x27; training ship in September, and was refitted to suit her new role. The ship was stationed at Portland until May 1922 when that establishment was closed and she returned to Devonport where she was again listed for disposal. &quot;Colossus&quot; was withdrawn from the disposal list on 23 July 1923 and hulked for the use of the training establishment at Devonport. The ship was withdrawn from &quot;Impregnable&quot; in August 1927, turned over to dockyard control on 23 February 1928 and sold to Charlestown Shipbreaking Industries for scrap in August. She was resold to Metal Industries, Limited and departed Devonport for Charlestown, Fife, on the 25th. &quot;Colossus&quot; arrived on 5 September to begin demolition.

<text>HMAS &quot;Inverell&quot;, named for the town of Inverell, New South Wales, was one of 60 s constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

After World War II, the corvette was transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN), where she served from 1952 to 1976.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Inverell&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Inverell&quot; was laid down by Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Co at Balmain, New South Wales on 7 December 1941. She was launched on 2 May 1942 by Mrs. T. S. Punch, Mayoress of Inverell, and commissioned into the RAN on 17 September 1942.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
&quot;Inverell&quot; began service in November 1942 as a convoy escort along the eastern Australian coast. At the end of December, she was relocated to Darwin, and primarily performed escort runs between Darwin and Thursday Island. On 11 November 1943, &quot;Inverell&quot; arrived at Williamstown Naval Dockyard for a month-long refit. On conclusion, she returned to Darwin and resumed escort duties.

In early February 1943, &quot;Inverell&quot; was required to rescue the crew of a United States Army Air Forces Liberator bomber, which had crashed on Croker Island. Of the eight survivors, one died onboard while the corvette was returning to Darwin. On 22 September 1944, &quot;Inverell&quot; sailed to Fremantle.

While based in Fremantle, the corvette&#x27;s main duties was to perform training exercises with United States Navy and Royal Navy submarines, with secondary duties including convoy escort and patrol. &quot;Inverell&quot; departed Fremantle for Darwin on 4 May 1945. Between 22 May and 11 July, the corvette was involve in minesweeping, before she, sister ship , and Services Reconnaissance Department vessel were assigned to Morotai. &quot;Inverell&quot; was required to tow &quot;River Snake&quot; for the first part of the voyage.

Based in Morotai, &quot;Inverell&quot; was primarily used as a patrol vessel until the end of World War II, when she became involved in the transfer of Dutch East Indies territories from Japanese to Allied control. From 21 September to 18 November, she was designated as the command ship for Port Directorate Macassar. On 29 November, she left Morotai, and spent the next month operating off the coast of Queensland before arriving in Brisbane on 25 December 1945 and preparing for decommissioning. Several delays meant that &quot;Inverell&quot; was not paid off into reserve until 14 June 1946. On 4 November 1946, &quot;Inverell&quot; was towed to Sydney by sister ship , arriving on 17 November.

The corvette received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942&quot; and Pacific 1942–45&quot;.

===RNZN service===
On 5 March 1952, &quot;Inverell&quot; and three other &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes (HMA Ships &quot;Echuca&quot;, , and &quot;Stawell&quot;) were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy. &quot;Inverell&quot; was commissioned into the RNZN on 10 April 1952, but was decommissioned into reserve after a refit.

In 1965, the corvette was refitted as a training and fisheries patrol ship to replace the frigate . The 4-inch gun was replaced by a second 40 mm Bofors gun, and minesweeping gear was removed. She was recommissioned on 15 August 1965, and served until 19 August 1976, when she was decommissioned.

On 1 November 1977, &quot;Inverell&quot; was sold to Pacific Scrap Limited of Auckland for scrapping.

<text>Operational Display Systems are systems used for tracking the status of multiple objects in avionics. Operational Display Systems are usually being developed by large countries&#x27; civil aviation authorities (such as the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, or the main Service Providers in Europe, such as DFS, NATS, DSNA, ENAIRE, MUAC, etc., coordinated by Eurocontrol in Europe), with inputs from technology companies and air traffic controllers associations.

Air traffic control systems gradually evolved from the old sweeping radar to modern computer-driven systems showing maps, weather information, aircraft routes and digitized radar tracks on an ergonomically-designed console.

Whereas in the past the information came only from a radar, current systems use inputs from a variety of sources. Radar is still used (multiple sources instead of just one), but is now complemented by transponder data (the aircraft sending out information regarding altitude and identifications) and soon satellite data (for more accurate positioning and overseas navigation).

As most data is now digital, this opens the way for extra functionalities to be embedded in the modern Operational Display System, such as trajectory prediction, conflict warnings, traffic flow management, arrival optimisation, etc. Two separate competing systems are currently operating within the US, Common ARTS (Automated Radar Terminal System (Lockheed Martin)) and STARS (Raytheon), with Common ARTS operating at the busiest facilities (New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Southern California, Chicago, Washington D.C. area, Denver, St. Louis, Minneapolis and San Francisco area) within the US.

On the display side, the round radar is being replaced by computer-driven cathode-ray tubes, which now are being replaced by modern LCD flat screens in en route systems. However a great many US Air Traffic TRACON facilities and Towers still use the older cathode-ray tube technology. Most of the larger TRACONs employ a 20&quot; x 20&quot; Sony color tube display; Common ARTS uses the ARTS Color Display (ACD) and the Remote ARTS Color Display (R-ACD), while STARS uses the Terminal Control Workstation (TCW) and Tower Display Workstation (TDW). Towers are slowly replacing old DBrite (cathode ray type remote displays) with an LCD type manufactured by Barco. However these display replacements are currently installed only at the busiest facilities with lower density traffic facilities slated for retrofit later.</text><links>

<doc id="452665" wikidata="Q86586" url="?curid=452665" title="Birtle, Manitoba">
<text>Birtle is an unincorporated urban community in the Prairie View Municipality within the Canadian province of Manitoba that held town status prior to 1 January 2015. It is located at the junction of Highways 83 and 42.

== History ==
Originally incorporated in 1884, the community lies in the Birdtail River valley. It features a spacious community park developed in the early years of the community with additions through the years to bring it to the current time where the original golf course designed to take advantage of the valley contours now enjoys the modern amenities and the tennis courts still located in the original location now feature modern plexipave surfaces and are some of the best in western Manitoba.

Another attraction is the Birdtail Country Museum, housed in an historic stone building on Main Street. The building was built in the early 1900s to be used as the Union Bank. Later it was purchased by the Royal Bank of Canada. The main floor was the bank premises. The second floor was the bank manager&#x27;s living-quarters.

In 1983, the building was purchased by the former town and the former Rural Municipality of Birtle. It officially opened as the Birdtail Country Museum on 24 May 1984, as a joint centennial project of the former town and former rural municipality. Inside are more than 4,000 artifacts related to the area, including such historical items such as the diaries of original settlers (Alfred Morton&#x27;s, from 1878), button hooks for ladies&#x27; boots, and ice-saws and ice-tongs used for harvesting ice from the Birdtail River in the winter. The Museum houses the trophies awarded to Samuel Larcombe, one of the early settlers of Birtle. In 1917, Larcombe, the &quot;World Wheat King&quot;, developed a variety of rust-resistant wheat. The second floor of the Museum is set up to resemble a Victorian home. People often come to the Museum to do genealogy research through the microfilm reader, which contains every edition of the Birtle &#x27;Eye Witness&#x27; newspaper, dating back to 1891. Local history books for the community and surrounding districts provide additional sources of information.

A self-guided Heritage Walking Tour describes the history of many of the buildings and sites in the community.

In 1974, the Municipality of Birtle History Committee published &quot;A View of the Birdtail&quot; documenting the history of the municipality from 1878 to 1974&quot;.&quot; The History Committee was chaired by then Mayor, Ray Howard and included representatives from each of the districts of the municipality. A second book, &quot;Passing it On&quot;&quot;,&quot; documenting the history of the municipality and town was published in 2009.

Birtle was designated as Birds Tail Rivulet on the Thompson map of 1813–14. The settlement was founded in 1879 and first called St. Clair City.

The Birtle Indian Residential School operated from 1888 to 1970.

== Geography ==
The Birdtail River is smaller slow flowing river dammed just above the Birtle Park, creating a small lake suitable for canoeing, kayaking and fishing. The Birdtail flows into the Assiniboine just a few miles south of Birtle. A 15-minute drive west the Qu&#x27;Apelle River flows into the Assiniboine. Many tributaries, ravines and valleys make this a very scenic region with ample habitat for a variety of wildlife and a popular area for birders. Fertile agricultural fields surround the community in all directions.

=== Climate ===
Summers are warm, with a mean temperature of in July. Winter are long and cold, with a mean temperature of in January. 
== Facilities and tourism ==
The local high school (grades 5 to 12), Birtle Collegiate Institute, draws students from surrounding communities. In addition to regular academic classes, the school offers a construction technology program and in 2014–15 offered an opportunity to receive both a highschool diploma and a health care aide certificate. The elementary school houses Kindergarten to grade 4 classes and houses the Park West School Division offices. 
The feature outdoor community recreation development is the Birtle Riverside Park where many amenities are found in one location. These include a golf course, licensed clubhouse restaurant, tennis courts, serviced campground, picnic area, tennis courts, a large playground and the Birtle beach – a sand bottom chlorinated swimming area alongside but separate from the river. There are many other recreation facilities in the community that include a skating arena and curling rink both with artificial ice, a 24/7 fitness centre, baseball and soccer leagues, and trails for cross country skiing and snowmobile trails linked to the Snowtraxx and Snowman routes across the province.

An attraction for tourists and locals is a costume barn, Whooo&#x27;s That? where visitors can peruse thousands of theme and period costumes or opt for a photo shoot in period dress.

The area has become known for its community of gardeners. National Communities in Bloom titles were won in 2000 and 2001. A biannual Gallery in the Garden event features art displayed in private and community gardens. Some private gardens are also available to be viewed throughout the summer season. Some are part of the Gardens of Western Manitoba seasonal self-guided tour. 

Also see the museum and heritage self-guided tour under &quot;history&quot;.

== Economy ==
The main industries of the area are agriculture and livestock: cattle and hogs primarily, and to a lesser extent sheep, goats, dairy cows, etc. The climate and soil are best suited for hard grains such as wheat, rye and barley, but canola also thrives. Crops are sown in spring (May) and harvested at the end of summer (August/September).

The potash mine located 50 km away just inside the Saskatchewan border provides employment for many people in the area. This has become more prominent since a large expansion of the industry which began in 2009. With the mine being so close, there are many additional services that serve Birtle and the surrounding communities. Mainline Motors, a locally owned car dealership as well as the Birtle Pharmacy, also locally owned. The Birdtail Oilfield has also offered a boost to the economy with revenue from oil rights as well and supporting industries. More aggressive drilling began taking place in 2010.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Birtle had a population of 625 living in 285 of its 324 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 642. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="452667" wikidata="Q1412691" url="?curid=452667" title="Wave packet">
<text>In physics, a wave packet (also known as a wave train or wave group) is a short burst of localized wave action that travels as a unit, outlined by an envelope. A wave packet can be analyzed into, or can be synthesized from, a potentially-infinite set of component sinusoidal waves of different wavenumbers, with phases and amplitudes such that they interfere constructively only over a small region of space, and destructively elsewhere. Any signal of a limited width in time or space requires many frequency components around a center frequency within a bandwidth inversely proportional to that width; even a gaussian function is considered a wave packet because its Fourier transform is a &quot;packet&quot; of waves of frequencies clustered around a central frequency. Each component wave function, and hence the wave packet, are solutions of a wave equation. Depending on the wave equation, the wave packet&#x27;s profile may remain constant (no dispersion) or it may change (dispersion) while propagating.

== Historical background ==
Ideas related to wave packets – modulation, carrier waves, phase velocity, and group velocity – date from the mid-1800s. The idea of a group velocity distinct from a wave&#x27;s phase velocity was first proposed by W.R. Hamilton in 1839, and the first full treatment was by Rayleigh in his &quot;Theory of Sound&quot; in 1877.

Erwin Schrödinger introduced the idea of wave packets just after publishing his famous wave equation. He solved his wave equation for a quantum harmonic oscillator, introduced the superposition principle, and used it to show that a compact state could persist. While this work did result in the important concept of coherent states, the wave packet concept did not endure. The year after Schrödinger&#x27;s paper, Werner Heisenberg published his paper on the uncertainty principle, showing in the process, that Schrödinger&#x27;s results only applied to quantum harmonic oscillators, not for example to Coulomb potential characteristic of atoms.

The following year, 1927, Charles Galton Darwin explored Schrödinger&#x27;s equation for an unbound electron in free space, assuming an initial Gaussian wave packet. Darwin showed that at time formula_1 later the position formula_2 of the packet traveling at velocity formula_3 would be

formula_4

where formula_5 is the uncertainty in the initial position.

Later in 1927 Paul Ehrenfest showed that the time, formula_6 for a matter wave packet of width formula_7 and mass formula_8 to spread by a factor of 2 was formula_9. Since formula_10 is so small, wave packets on the scale of macroscopic objects, with large width and mass, double only at cosmic time scales.

== Significance in quantum mechanics ==

Quantum mechanics describes the nature of atomic and subatomic systems using Schrödinger&#x27;s wave equation. The classical limit of quantum mechanics and many formulations of quantum scattering use wave packets formed from various solutions to this equation.
Quantum wave packet profiles change while propagating; they show dispersion. Physicists have concluded that &quot;wave packets would not do as representations of subatomic particles&quot;.

=== Wave packets and the classical limit ===
Schrodinger developed wave packets in hopes of interpreting quantum wave solutions as locally compact wave groups. Such packets tradeoff position localization for spreading momentum. In the coordinate representation of the wave (such as the Cartesian coordinate system), the position of the particle&#x27;s localized probability is specified by the position of the packet solution. The narrower the spatial wave packet, and therefore the better localized the position of the wave packet, the larger the spread in the momentum of the wave. This trade-off between spread in position and spread in momentum is a characteristic feature of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

One kind of optimal tradeoff minimizes the product of position uncertainty formula_7 and momentum uncertainty formula_12. If we place such a packet at rest it stays at rest: the average value of the position and momentum match a classical particle. However it spreads out in all directions with a velocity given by the optimal momentum uncertainty formula_12. The spread is so fast that in the distance of once around an atom the wave packet is unrecognizable.

=== Wave packets and quantum scattering ===
Particle interactions are called scattering in physics; wave packet mathematics play an important role in quantum scattering approaches. A monochromatic (single momentum) source produces convergence difficulties in the scattering models. Scattering problems also have classical limits. Whenever the scattering target (for example an atom) has a size much smaller than wave packet, the center of the wave packet follows scattering classical trajectories. In other cases, the wave packet distorts and scatters as it interacts with the target.

== Basic behaviors ==

=== Non-dispersive ===

Without dispersion the wave packet maintains its shape as it propagates.
As an example of propagation &quot;without dispersion&quot;, consider wave solutions to the following wave equation from classical physics
formula_14

where is the speed of the wave&#x27;s propagation in a given medium.

Using the physics time convention, , the wave equation has plane-wave solutions
formula_15

where the relation between the angular frequency and angular wave vector is given by the dispersion relation:
formula_16
such that formula_17. This relation should be valid so that the plane wave is a solution to the wave equation. As the relation is &quot;linear&quot;, the wave equation is said to be non-dispersive.

To simplify, consider the one-dimensional wave equation with . Then the general solution is
formula_18
where the first and second term represent a wave propagating in the positive respectively negative .

A wave packet is a localized disturbance that results from the sum of many different wave forms. If the packet is strongly localized, more frequencies are needed to allow the constructive superposition in the region of localization and destructive superposition outside the region. From the basic one-dimensional plane-wave solutions, a general form of a wave packet can be expressed as
formula_19
where the amplitude , containing the coefficients of the wave superposition, follows from taking the inverse Fourier transform of a &quot;sufficiently nice&quot; 
initial wave evaluated at :
formula_20
and formula_21 comes from Fourier transform conventions.

For example, choosing
formula_22

we obtain
formula_23

and finally
formula_24

The nondispersive propagation of the real or imaginary part of this wave packet is presented in the above animation.

=== Dispersive ===

By contrast, in the case of dispersion, a wave changes shape during propagation. For example, the free Schrödinger equation ,
formula_25
has plane-wave solutions of the form:
formula_26
where formula_27 is a constant and the dispersion relation satisfies
formula_28
with the subscripts denoting unit vector notation. As the dispersion relation is non-linear, the free Schrödinger equation is dispersive.

In this case, the wave packet is given by:
formula_29
where once again formula_30 is simply the Fourier transform of formula_31. If formula_31 (and therefore formula_30) is a Gaussian function, the wave packet is called a Gaussian wave packet.

For example, the solution to the one-dimensional free Schrödinger equation (with , , and &quot;ħ&quot; set equal to one) satisfying the initial condition 
formula_34 
representing a wave packet localized in space at the origin as a Gaussian function, is seen to be
formula_35

An impression of the dispersive behavior of this wave packet is obtained by looking at the probability density:
formula_36
It is evident that this dispersive wave packet, while moving with constant group velocity , is delocalizing rapidly: it has a width increasing with time as , so eventually it diffuses to an unlimited region of space.

== Gaussian wave packets in quantum mechanics ==


The above dispersive Gaussian wave packet, unnormalized and just centered at the origin, instead, at =0, can now be written in 3D, now in standard units:
formula_37
The Fourier transform is also a Gaussian in terms of the wavenumber, the k-vector, 
formula_38
With and its inverse adhering to the uncertainty relation
formula_39 
such that 
formula_40
can be considered the &quot;square of the width of the wave packet&quot;, whereas its inverse can be written as
formula_41


Each separate wave only phase-rotates in time, so that the time dependent Fourier-transformed solution is
The inverse Fourier transform is still a Gaussian, but now the parameter has become complex, and there is an overall normalization factor.
The integral of over all space is invariant, because it is the inner product of with the state of zero energy, which is a wave with infinite wavelength, a constant function of space. For any energy eigenstate , the inner product,
formula_42
only changes in time in a simple way: its phase rotates with a frequency determined by the energy of . When has zero energy, like the infinite wavelength wave, it doesn&#x27;t change at all.

For a given formula_1, the phase of the wave function varies with position as formula_44. It varies &quot;quadratically&quot; with position, which means that it is different from multiplication by a linear phase factor formula_45 as is the case of imparting a constant momentum to the wave packet. In general, the phase of a gaussian wave packet has both a linear term and a quadratic term. The coefficient of the quadratic term begins by increasing from formula_46 towards formula_47 as the gaussian wave packet becomes sharper, then at the moment of maximum sharpness, the phase of the wave function varies linearly with position. Then the coefficient of the quadratic term increases from formula_47 towards formula_49, as the gaussian wave packet spreads out again.

The integral is also invariant, which is a statement of the conservation of probability. Explicitly,
formula_50
where is the distance from the origin, the speed of the particle is zero, and width given by 
formula_51
which is at (arbitrarily chosen) time while eventually growing linearly in time, as , indicating wave-packet spreading.

For example, if an electron wave packet is initially localized in a region of atomic dimensions (i.e., m) then the width of the packet doubles in about s. Clearly, particle wave packets spread out very rapidly indeed (in free space): For instance, after ms, the width will have grown to about a kilometer.

This linear growth is a reflection of the (time-invariant) momentum uncertainty: the wave packet is confined to a narrow , and so has a momentum which is uncertain (according to the uncertainty principle) by the amount , a spread in velocity of , and thus in the future position by . The uncertainty relation is then a strict inequality, very far from saturation, indeed! The initial uncertainty has now increased by a factor of (for large ).

=== The 2D case ===
A gaussian 2D quantum wave function:

formula_52
formula_53

where

formula_54

formula_55

== The Airy wave train ==

In contrast to the above Gaussian wave packet, which moves at constant group velocity, and always disperses, there exists a wave function based on Airy functions, that propagates freely without envelope dispersion, maintaining its shape, and accelerates in free space:
formula_56
where, for simplicity (and nondimensionalization), choosing , , and &quot;B&quot; an arbitrary constant results in
formula_57

There is no dissonance with Ehrenfest&#x27;s theorem in this force-free situation, because the state is both non-normalizable and has an undefined (infinite) for all times. (To the extent that it could be defined, for all times, despite the apparent acceleration of the front.)

The Airy wave train is the only dispersionless wave in one dimensional free space. In higher dimensions, other dispersionless waves are possible.
In phase space, this is evident in the pure state Wigner quasiprobability distribution of this wavetrain, whose shape in &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; is invariant as time progresses, but whose features accelerate to the right, in accelerating parabolas. The Wigner function satisfiesformula_58The three equalities demonstrate three facts:

# Time-evolution is equivalent to a translation in phase-space by formula_59.
# The contour lines of the Wigner function are parabolas of form formula_60.
# Time-evolution is equivalent to a shearing in phase space along the formula_2-direction at speed formula_62.

Note the momentum distribution obtained by integrating over all is constant. Since this is the probability density in momentum space, it is evident that the wave function itself is not normalizable.

== Free propagator ==

The narrow-width limit of the Gaussian wave packet solution discussed is the free propagator kernel . For other differential equations, this is usually called the Green&#x27;s function, but in quantum mechanics it is traditional to reserve the name Green&#x27;s function for the time Fourier transform of .

Returning to one dimension for simplicity, with &quot;m&quot; and ħ set equal to one, when is the infinitesimal quantity , the Gaussian initial condition, rescaled so that its integral is one,
formula_63
becomes a delta function, , so that its time evolution,
formula_64
yields the propagator.

Note that a very narrow initial wave packet instantly becomes infinitely wide, but with a phase which is more rapidly oscillatory at large values of &quot;x&quot;. This might seem strange—the solution goes from being localized at one point to being &quot;everywhere&quot; at &quot;all later times&quot;, but it is a reflection of the enormous momentum uncertainty of a localized particle, as explained above.

Further note that the norm of the wave function is infinite, which is also correct, since the square of a delta function is divergent in the same way.

The factor involving is an infinitesimal quantity which is there to make sure that integrals over are well defined. In the limit that , becomes purely oscillatory, and integrals of are not absolutely convergent. In the remainder of this section, it &quot;will&quot; be set to zero, but in order for all the integrations over intermediate states to be well defined, the limit &quot;ε&quot;→0 is to be only taken after the final state is calculated.

The propagator is the amplitude for reaching point &quot;x&quot; at time &quot;t&quot;, when starting at the origin, &quot;x&quot;=0. By translation invariance, the amplitude for reaching a point &quot;x&quot; when starting at point &quot;y&quot; is the same function, only now translated,
formula_65

In the limit when &quot;t&quot; is small, the propagator goes to a delta function
formula_66
but only in the sense of distributions: The integral of this quantity multiplied by an arbitrary differentiable test function gives the value of the test function at zero.

To see this, note that the integral over all space of equals 1 at all times,
formula_67
since this integral is the inner-product of &quot;K&quot; with the uniform wave function. But the phase factor in the exponent has a nonzero spatial derivative everywhere except at the origin, and so when the time is small there are fast phase cancellations at all but one point. This is rigorously true when the limit &quot;ε&quot;→0 is taken at the very end.

So the propagation kernel is the (future) time evolution of a delta function, and it is continuous, in a sense: it goes to the initial delta function at small times. If the initial wave function is an infinitely narrow spike at position ,
formula_68
it becomes the oscillatory wave,
formula_69

Now, since every function can be written as a weighted sum of such narrow spikes,
formula_70
the time evolution of &quot;every function&quot; 0 is determined by this propagation kernel ,
 e^{i (x-y)^2 / 2t} dy \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, this is a formal way to express the fundamental solution or general solution. The interpretation of this expression is that the amplitude for a particle to be found at point at time is the amplitude that it started at , times the amplitude that it went from to , &quot;summed over all the possible starting points&quot;. In other words, it is a convolution of the kernel with the arbitrary initial condition ,
formula_71

Since the amplitude to travel from to after a time +&#x27; can be considered in two steps, the propagator obeys the composition identity,
formula_72
which can be interpreted as follows: the amplitude to travel from to in time +&#x27; is the sum of the amplitude to travel from to in time , multiplied by the amplitude to travel from to in time &#x27;, summed over &quot;all possible intermediate states y&quot;. This is a property of an arbitrary quantum system, and by subdividing the time into many segments, it allows the time evolution to be expressed as a path integral.

== Analytic continuation to diffusion ==

The spreading of wave packets in quantum mechanics is directly related to the spreading of probability densities in diffusion. For a particle which is randomly walking, the probability density function satisfies the diffusion equation
formula_73
where the factor of 2, which can be removed by rescaling either time or space, is only for convenience.

A solution of this equation is the time-varying Gaussian function
formula_74
which is a form of the heat kernel. Since the integral of &quot;ρt&quot; is constant while the width is becoming narrow at small times, this function approaches a delta function at &quot;t&quot;=0,
formula_75
again only in the sense of distributions, so that
formula_76
for any test function .

The time-varying Gaussian is the propagation kernel for the diffusion equation and it obeys the convolution identity,
formula_77
which allows diffusion to be expressed as a path integral. The propagator is the exponential of an operator ,
formula_78
which is the infinitesimal diffusion operator,
formula_79

A matrix has two indices, which in continuous space makes it a function of and &#x27;. In this case, because of translation invariance, the matrix element only depend on the difference of the position, and a convenient abuse of notation is to refer to the operator, the matrix elements, and the function of the difference by the same name:
formula_80

Translation invariance means that continuous matrix multiplication,
formula_81
is essentially convolution,
formula_82

The exponential can be defined over a range of &quot;t&quot;s which include complex values, so long as integrals over the propagation kernel stay convergent,
formula_83
As long as the real part of is positive, for large values of , is exponentially decreasing, and integrals over are indeed absolutely convergent.

The limit of this expression for approaching the pure imaginary axis is the above Schrödinger propagator encountered,
formula_84
which illustrates the above time evolution of Gaussians.

From the fundamental identity of exponentiation, or path integration,
formula_85
holds for all complex &quot;z&quot; values, where the integrals are absolutely convergent so that the operators are well defined.

Thus, quantum evolution of a Gaussian, which is the complex diffusion kernel &quot;K&quot;,
formula_86
amounts to the time-evolved state,
formula_87

This illustrates the above diffusive form of the complex Gaussian solutions,
formula_88

<text>The nasal cavity is a large, air-filled space above and behind the nose in the middle of the face. The nasal septum divides the cavity into two cavities, also known as fossae. Each cavity is the continuation of one of the two nostrils. The nasal cavity is the uppermost part of the respiratory system and provides the nasal passage for inhaled air from the nostrils to the nasopharynx and rest of the respiratory tract.

The paranasal sinuses surround and drain into the nasal cavity.

== Structure ==

The term &quot;nasal cavity&quot; can refer to each of the two cavities of the nose, or to the two sides combined.
The lateral wall of each nasal cavity mainly consists of the maxilla. However, there is a deficiency that is compensated for by the perpendicular plate of the palatine bone, the medial pterygoid plate, the labyrinth of ethmoid and the inferior concha. The paranasal sinuses are connected to the nasal cavity through small orifices called ostia. Most of these ostia communicate with the nose through the lateral nasal wall, via a semi-lunar depression in it known as the semilunar hiatus. The hiatus is bound laterally by a projection known as the uncinate process. This region is called the ostiomeatal complex.

The roof of each nasal cavity is formed in its upper third to one half by the nasal bone and more inferiorly by the junctions of the upper lateral cartilage and nasal septum. Connective tissue and skin cover the bony and cartilaginous components of the nasal dorsum.

The floor of the nasal cavities, which also form the roof of the mouth, is made up by the bones of the hard palate: the horizontal plate of the palatine bone posteriorly and the palatine process of the maxilla anteriorly. The most anterior part of the nasal cavity is the nasal vestibule. The vestibule is enclosed by the nasal cartilages and lined by the same epithelium of the skin (stratified squamous, keratinized). Within the vestibule, this changes into the typical respiratory epithelium that lines the rest of the nasal cavity and respiratory tract. Inside the nostrils of the vestibule are the nasal hair, which filter dust and other matter that are breathed in. The back of the cavity blends, via the choanae, into the nasopharynx.

The nasal cavity is divided in two by the vertical nasal septum. On the side of each nasal cavity are three horizontal outgrowths called nasal conchae (singular &quot;concha&quot;) or turbinates. These turbinates disrupt the airflow, directing air toward the olfactory epithelium on the surface of the turbinates and the septum. The vomeronasal organ is located at the back of the septum and has a role in pheromone detection.

The nasal cavity has a nasal valve area that includes an external nasal valve and an internal nasal valve. The external nasal valve is bounded medially by the columella, laterally by the lateral nasal cartilage, and posteriorly by the nasal sill. The internal nasal valve is bounded laterally by the caudal border of the lateral nasal cartilage, medially by the dorsal nasal septum, and inferiorly by the anterior border of the inferior turbinate. The internal nasal valve is the narrowest region of the nasal cavity and is the primary site of nasal resistance. 

===Segments===
The nasal cavity is divided into two segments: the respiratory segment and the olfactory segment.
* The respiratory segment comprises most of each nasal cavity, and is lined with ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium (also called respiratory epithelium). The conchae, or turbinates, are located in this region. The turbinates have a very vascularized lamina propria (erectile tissue) allowing the venous plexuses of their mucosa to engorge with blood, restricting airflow and causing air to be directed to the other side of the nose, which acts in concert by shunting blood out of its turbinates. This cycle occurs approximately every two and a half hours. 
* The olfactory segment is lined with a specialized type of pseudostratified columnar epithelium, known as olfactory epithelium, which contains receptors for the sense of the smell. This segment is located in and beneath the mucosa of the roof of each nasal cavity and the medial side of each middle turbinate. Histological sections appear yellowish-brown due to the presence of lipofuscin pigments. Olfactory mucosal cell types include bipolar neurons, supporting (sustentacular) cells, basal cells, and Bowman&#x27;s glands. The axons of the bipolar neurons form the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) which enters the brain through the cribriform plate. Bowman&#x27;s glands are serous glands in the lamina propria, whose secretions trap and dissolve odoriferous substances.

=== Blood supply===
There is a rich blood supply to the nasal cavity.
Blood supply comes from branches of both the internal and external carotid artery, including branches of the facial artery and maxillary artery. The named arteries of the nose are:
* Sphenopalatine artery and greater palatine artery, branches of the maxillary artery.
*Anterior ethmoidal artery and posterior ethmoidal artery, branches of the ophthalmic artery
*Septal branches of the superior labial artery, a branch of the facial artery, which supplies the vestibule of the nasal cavity.

===Nerve supply===
Innervation of the nasal cavity responsible for the sense of smell is via the olfactory nerve, which sends microscopic fibers from the olfactory bulb through the cribriform plate to reach the top of the nasal cavity.

General sensory innervation is by branches of the trigeminal nerve (V1 and V2):
*Nasociliary nerve (V1)
*Anterior ethmoidal nerve from the nasociliary nerve (V1)
*Posterior nasal branches of maxillary nerve (V2)

The nasal cavity is innervated by autonomic fibers. Sympathetic innervation to the blood vessels of the mucosa causes them to constrict, while the control of secretion by the mucous glands is carried on postganglionic parasympathetic nerve fibers originating from the facial nerve.

== Function ==
The two nasal cavities condition the air to be received by the other areas of the respiratory tract. Owing to the large surface area provided by the nasal conchae (also known as turbinates), the air passing through the nasal cavity is warmed or cooled to within 1 degree of body temperature. In addition, the air is humidified, and dust and other particulate matter is removed by nasal hair in the nostrils. The entire mucosa of the nasal cavity is covered by a blanket of mucus, which lies superficial to the microscopic cilia and also filters inspired air. The cilia of the respiratory epithelium move the secreted mucus and particulate matter posteriorly towards the pharynx where it passes into the esophagus and is digested in the stomach. The nasal cavity also houses the sense of smell and contributes greatly to taste sensation through its posterior communication with the mouth via the choanae.

==Clinical significance==

Diseases of the nasal cavity include viral, bacterial and fungal infections, nasal cavity tumors, both benign and much more often malignant, as well as inflammations of the nasal mucosa.
Many problems can affect the nose, including:
*Deviated septum - a shifting of the wall that divides the nasal cavity into halves
*Nasal polyps - soft growths that develop on the lining of the nose or sinuses
*Nosebleeds
*Rhinitis - inflammation of the nose and sinuses sometimes caused by allergies. The main symptom is a runny nose.
*Nasal fractures, also known as a broken nose
*Common cold
* Sinonasal tumors

<text>Alfred Louis Kroeber ( ; June 11, 1876 – October 5, 1960) was an American cultural anthropologist. He received his PhD under Franz Boas at Columbia University in 1901, the first doctorate in anthropology awarded by Columbia. He was also the first professor appointed to the Department of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. He played an integral role in the early days of its Museum of Anthropology, where he served as director from 1909 through 1947. Kroeber provided detailed information about Ishi, the last surviving member of the Yahi people, whom he studied over a period of years. He was the father of the acclaimed novelist, poet, and writer of short stories Ursula K. Le Guin.

==Life==

Kroeber was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to parents of German Protestant origin. His mother, Johanna Mueller, was an American of German descent; his father, Florenz Friederick Martin Kroeber, came to the United States from Germany at the age of ten, with his parents and family, and became an importer of French clocks as his wife&#x27;s father, Nicholas Mueller. The family belonged to a German-American milieu that was upper middle-class, classical and rationalistic, and schooled in the German intellectual tradition.

Alfred&#x27;s family moved into New York City when Alfred was quite young, and he was tutored and attended private schools there. He had three younger siblings and all had scholarly interests. The family was bilingual, speaking German at home, and Kroeber also began to study Latin and Greek in school, beginning a lifelong interest in languages. He attended Columbia College at the age of 16, joining the Philolexian Society and earning an BA in English in 1896 and an MA in Romantic drama in 1897. Changing fields to the new one of anthropology, he received his PhD under Franz Boas at Columbia University in 1901, basing his 28-page dissertation on decorative symbolism on his field work among the Arapaho. It was the first doctorate in anthropology awarded by Columbia.

Kroeber spent most of his career in California, primarily at the University of California, Berkeley. He was both a professor of Anthropology and the Director of what was then the University of California Museum of Anthropology (now the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology). The anthropology department&#x27;s headquarters building at the University of California was named Kroeber Hall in his honor, before being unnamed January 26, 2021, in order to &quot;help Berkeley recognize a challenging part of our history, while better supporting the diversity of today&#x27;s academic community.&quot; He was associated with Berkeley until his retirement in 1946. He died in Paris on October 5, 1960.

==Personal life==
Kroeber married Henriette Rothschild in 1906. She contracted tuberculosis and died in 1913, after several years of illness.

In 1926 he married again, to Theodora Kracaw Brown, a widow who had been a student in one of his graduate seminars. They had two children: Karl Kroeber, a literary critic, and the science fiction writer Ursula Kroeber Le Guin. In addition, Alfred adopted Theodora&#x27;s sons by her first marriage, Ted and Clifton Brown, who both took his surname.

In 2003, Clifton and Karl Kroeber published a book of essays on Ishi&#x27;s story, which they co-edited, called, &quot;Ishi in Three Centuries&quot;. This is the first scholarly book on Ishi to contain essays by Native American writers and academics.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Theodora Kroeber wrote a biography of him, titled &quot;Alfred Kroeber: A Personal Configuration&quot;. It was published by the University of California Press in 1970. David G. Mandelbaum, a cultural anthropologist and former colleague of Alfred, stated that this biography was just as important a work from an anthropologist&#x27;s perspective as &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot;.

==Influence==
Although he is known primarily as a cultural anthropologist, he did significant work in archaeology and anthropological linguistics, and he contributed to anthropology by making connections between archaeology and culture. He conducted excavations in New Mexico, Mexico, and Peru. In Peru he helped found the Institute for Andean Studies (IAS) with the Peruvian anthropologist Julio C. Tello and other major scholars.

Kroeber and his students did important work collecting cultural data on western tribes of Native Americans. The work done in preserving information about Californian tribes appeared in &quot;Handbook of the Indians of California&quot; (1925). In that book, Kroeber first described a pattern in Californian groups where a social unit was smaller and less hierarchically organized than a tribe, which was elaborated upon in &quot;The Patwin and their Neighbors&quot; in which Kroeber first coined the term &quot;tribelet&quot; to describe this level of organization. Kroeber is credited with developing the concepts of culture area, cultural configuration (&quot;Cultural and Natural Areas of Native North America&quot;, 1939), and cultural fatigue (&quot;Anthropology&quot;, 1963).

Kroeber influenced many of his contemporaries in his views as a cultural historian. During his lifetime, he was known as the &quot;Dean of American Anthropologists&quot;. Kroeber and Roland B. Dixon were very influential in the genetic classification of Native American languages in North America, being responsible for theoretical groupings such as Penutian and Hokan, based on common languages.

He is noted for working with Ishi, who was claimed to be the last California Yahi Indian. (Ishi may have been of mixed ethnic heritage, with a father from the Wintu, Maidu or Nomlaki tribes.) His second wife, Theodora Kracaw Kroeber, wrote a well-known biography of Ishi, &quot;Ishi in Two Worlds&quot;. Kroeber&#x27;s relationship with Ishi was the subject of a film, &quot;The Last of His Tribe&quot; (1992), starring Jon Voight as Kroeber and Graham Greene as Ishi.

Kroeber&#x27;s textbook, &quot;Anthropology&quot; (1923, 1948), was widely used for many years. In the late 1940s, it was one of ten books required as reading for all students during their first year at Columbia University. His book, &quot;Configurations of Cultural Growth&quot; (1944), had a lasting impact on social scientific research on genius and greatness; Kroeber believed that genius arose out of culture at particular times, rather than holding to &quot;the great man&quot; theory.

Kroeber&#x27;s childhood friend Carl Alsberg described him as a &quot;good listener&quot; and able &quot;to be objective, to see the other point of view, to penetrate behind another person&#x27;s behavior to his underlying thought [...] These traits indicate a sincerity and simplicity of character that primitive peoples sense at once and to which they respond by giving their confidence.&quot;

From 1920 to 1923 Kroeber conducted an active practice as a lay psychoanalyst, with an office in San Francisco.

==Indian land claims==
Kroeber served early on as the plaintiffs&#x27; director of research in &quot;Indians of California v. the United States&quot;, a land claim case. Omer Stewart of the University of Colorado served as associate director. Ralph Beals of the University of California, Los Angeles, served as director of research for the federal government in the case. Both men were former students of Kroeber. Kroeber&#x27;s impact on the Indian Claims Commission may well have established the way expert witnesses presented testimony before the tribunal. Several of his former students also served as expert witnesses; for instance, Stewart directed the plaintiff research for the Ute and for the Shoshone peoples.
