<text>The spur-winged lapwing or spur-winged plover (Vanellus spinosus) is a lapwing species, one of a group of largish waders in the family Charadriidae.

==Taxonomy==
The spur-winged lapwing was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the plovers in the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius spinosus&quot;. He specified the type locality as Egypt. The specific epithet is from Latin meaning &quot;thorny&quot; (from &quot;spina&quot; meaning &quot;thorn&quot;). Linnaeus based his account on a description by the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselquist that had been published in 1757. The spur-winged lapwing is now one of 23 species placed in the genus &quot;Vanellus&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French naturalist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. They are medium-large waders with black crown, chest, foreneck stripe and tail. The face, the rest of the neck and belly are white and the wings and back are light brown. The bill and legs are black. Its striking appearance is supplemented by its noisy nature, with a loud &quot;did-he-do-it&quot; call. The bird&#x27;s common name refers to a small claw or spur hidden in each of its wings.

==Distribution==
The spur-winged lapwing breeds around the eastern Mediterranean, and in a wide band from sub-Saharan west Africa to Arabia. The Greek and Turkish breeders are migratory, but other populations are resident. The species is declining in its northern range, but is abundant in much of tropical Africa, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range. The spur-winged lapwing is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; applies.

In eastern and southern Africa the species has seen a range increase, entering Zambia for the first time in 1999 and spreading south and west.

==Behaviour and ecology==
This species has a preference for marshes and similar freshwater wetland habitats. The food of the spur-winged lapwing is insects and other invertebrates, which are picked from the ground.

It lays four blotchy yellowish eggs on a ground scrape. The spur-winged lapwing is known to sometimes use the wing-claws in an attack on animals and, rarely, people, who get too close to the birds&#x27; exposed offspring.

==Supposed cleaning symbiosis==
The &quot;spur-winged plover&quot; was identified by Henry Scherren as the &quot;trochilus&quot; bird said by the Greek historian Herodotus to be involved in what would now be called a cleaning symbiosis with the Nile crocodile. However, there is no reliable evidence that this or any other species in fact has such a relationship, although Cott does record that spur-winged plovers are the birds that most often feed around basking crocodiles, and are tolerated by them.

<doc id="446571" wikidata="Q387368" url="?curid=446571" title="Jaromír, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Jaromír (died 4 November 1038), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia in 1003, from 1004 to 1012, and again from 1034 to 1035.

== Early life ==
He was the second son of Duke Boleslaus II the Pious (d. 999). His mother may have been either one of his father&#x27;s two wives: Adiva or Emma of Mělník.

In 1002, Jaromír rebelled against the rule of his elder brother Boleslaus III, who had him castrated and expelled with his mother and his brother Oldřich to the Bavarian court at Regensburg. Nevertheless, Boleslaus was unable to secure the Prague throne, as he was deposed by the Bohemian nobility and his rule was taken over by his Přemyslid cousin Vladivoj, backed by the Polish duke Bolesław I the Brave. Vladivoj also secured the support of King Henry II of Germany when he received the Duchy of Bohemia as a royal fief.

== Reign ==
When Vladivoj died the next year, Jaromír and Oldřich returned to Bohemia and Jaromír was proclaimed duke by the Bohemian nobles. The Bohemian lands were occupied in turn by the Polish forces of Bolesław, who reinstated Boleslaus III as duke. After he ordered a massacre of the rival Vršovci clan, however, he lost the support of the Polish ruler and was finally deprived of power. Meanwhile, Jaromír had sought military backing from King Henry II. At Merseburg, he promised to hold Bohemia as a vassal of the king. This action definitively placed Bohemia within the jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1004, Jaromír occupied Prague with a German army and proclaimed himself Bohemian duke. Nevertheless, the state he regained was a small one, as Polish forces still held Moravia, Silesia, and Lusatia. Jaromír&#x27;s reign—like so many of the other early Czech rulers—was a struggle to regain lost lands. He remained a loyal supporter of King Henry in the smouldering German–Polish War. Nonetheless, the German king took no action when, in 1012, Jaromír was dethroned by Oldřich (who had him blinded) and forced once again into exile. In a surprise campaign, Jaromír once again managed to depose Oldřich with the support of Emperor Conrad II in 1033, but his second reign was short-lived. A year later, Oldřich was restored by his son Bretislaus I.

Jaromír was imprisoned at Lysá nad Labem and died on 4 November 1035 or 1038, a year after the death of his brother. He was assassinated by one of the Vršovci clan. According to the Chronica Boemorum, &quot;Kochan sent his executioner, and when the blind man was sitting on the toilet at night, emptying his stomach, he pierced him with a sharp spear from behind to the bowels of the abdomen&quot;.

<doc id="446574" wikidata="Q1393071" url="?curid=446574" title="Shocker (gesture)">
<text>The Shocker is a hand gesture with a sexual connotation. The index, middle, and little fingers are extended, while the ring finger is curled or bent down. The index and middle fingers are held together. The thumb may be tucked against the palm or – in a variation on the gesture – extended.

The gesture refers to the sex act of inserting the index and middle fingers into a partner&#x27;s vagina and the little finger into their anus, the latter of which is presumed to &quot;shock&quot; them. If the thumb is extended, it refers to simultaneously stimulating their clitoris. The hand gesture is not necessarily practical for the sex act it represents, however. 

The standard form of the gesture is known colloquially as &quot;two in the pink, one in the stink&quot;, referring to the number of fingers inserted into the vagina and anus.

<doc id="446582" wikidata="Q266098" url="?curid=446582" title="Linares International Chess Tournament">
<text>The Linares International Chess Tournament (Spanish: &quot;Torneo Internacional de Ajedrez Ciudad de Linares&quot;) was an annual chess tournament, usually played around the end of February, which takes its name from the city of Linares in the Jaén province of Andalusia, Spain, in which it was held. It is sometimes described as the Wimbledon of chess, being one of the strongest annual tournaments held on the &quot;de facto&quot; chess tour, along with the &quot;Tata Steel&quot; (Wijk aan Zee), Tal Memorial and Dortmund events.

The Linares tournament began in 1978 and was held annually from 1988 to 2010 (with the exception of 1996). Since 2010, the tournament has not been held for financial reasons.

== History ==
The event, sponsored by Spanish businessman Luis Rentero, was first held in 1978. At that time it was not an elite event and was won by the relatively unknown Swede Jaan Eslon, on tie-break from the Argentine Roberto Luis Debarnot). After the following year&#x27;s event, it was held every other year until 1987 when no tournament took place, that being the year that Linares hosted the Candidates&#x27; Final, a match to determine a challenger for Kasparov&#x27;s world title featuring Anatoly Karpov and Andrei Sokolov. The postponed 1987 event was deferred to 1988 and the tournament from that point onwards became an annual event, with the exception of 1996, when the Women&#x27;s World Chess Championship was held.
Rentero was a strong opponent of short draws in chess, to the point that he offered cash bonuses for playing longer games. It&#x27;s said that participants in these so-called &quot;grand master draws&quot; were sometimes penalised by receiving no invitation for the next year&#x27;s edition.
The 1994 tournament had an average Elo rating of 2685, the highest ever at that time. The field, in eventual finishing order, consisted of Karpov, Kasparov, Shirov, Bareev, Kramnik, Lautier, Anand, Kamsky, Topalov, Ivanchuk, Gelfand, Illescas, Judit Polgár, and Beliavsky. Karpov won with an undefeated 11/13. Jeff Sonas considered Karpov&#x27;s performance the best tournament result in history.
The 1994 tournament was also noted for an incident in which Garry Kasparov &quot;took a move back&quot; against Judit Polgár. Kasparov&#x27;s fingers briefly released a knight before he realized the move was a blunder; he then moved the knight to a different square. Polgár (17 years old at the time) did not protest and the arbiter did not intervene. Kasparov went on to win the game.

In 1998, the format of the tournament changed from a single round-robin tournament to a double round-robin event (meaning that each participant plays every other participant twice, once with each colour).

Kasparov announced his retirement from chess after the 2005 tournament.

From 2006 through 2008, the first half of the tournament took place in the Mexican city of Morelia. The second half took place in Linares. Consequently, the event is sometimes referred to as Morelia-Linares.

In 2009 and 2010, the whole event took place in Linares.

The Linares tournament of 2011 was cancelled, for reasons including general economic problems. The tournament was cancelled again in 2012, with no return since.

<doc id="446584" wikidata="Q1543227" url="?curid=446584" title="Grounded for Life">
<text>Grounded for Life is an American television sitcom that debuted on January 10, 2001, as a mid-season replacement on Fox. Created by Mike Schiff and Bill Martin, it ran for two seasons on the network until being canceled only two episodes into its third season. It was immediately picked up for the rest of the third season by The WB, where it aired for two additional seasons until the series ended on January 28, 2005.

The show starred Donal Logue and Megyn Price as Sean and Claudia Finnerty, an Irish Catholic couple living on Staten Island, New York, with their three children: Lily (Lynsey Bartilson), Jimmy (Griffin Frazen), and Henry (Jake Burbage). The show also starred Kevin Corrigan, Bret Harrison, and Richard Riehle. It featured guest stars such as Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Mila Kunis, Wilmer Valderrama (cast of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;), Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson (cast of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;), Mike Vogel, Natasha Lyonne, Vincent Pastore, Miriam Flynn, Stephen Root, and Elizabeth Berridge (Kevin Corrigan&#x27;s wife).

==Cast and characters==

===Main cast===


===Recurring cast===
Sister Helen (Miriam Flynn) is the nun and principal at Lily, Jimmy, and Henry&#x27;s school. She frequently tries to tell Sean and Claudia how to raise their kids, whom she is always berating at school (Lily&#x27;s skirts are too revealing, Jimmy&#x27;s hair is too long, etc.). Sean once heard her use the F-word.

Dean Peramotti (Mike Vogel) was the drummer of Sean and Eddie&#x27;s band. He and Lily date until she leaves him for Brad.

Dan O&#x27;Keefe (Floyd Van Buskirk in season 1, Gregory Jbara in all later appearances) is Brad&#x27;s father. Sean and Dan never get along and are always fighting. He is busted for having an affair when Sean challenges him to a tennis match and then notices that Dan has been useless all the weekend &quot;tennis lessons.&quot; Connie discovers this, and they break up. Connie then has a brief fling with Eddie, but she and Dan soon get back together.

===Finnerty household===
The household that makes for the primary location for the series features exciting background props that refer to the family&#x27;s interests. Throughout the series, there is a picture of Lou Thesz hanging in the living room and a real-life picture of a young Lynsey Bartilson, who plays Lily in the series. The living room also features a framed and hung vintage baseball bat, a broken guitar (used by Sean in his younger days), and a pair of crucifixes, representing the Catholic religion of the family.

The refrigerator in the kitchen is always changing but prominently features fruit magnets and a sticker resembling a video game developer&#x27;s logo Rockstar Games. Jimmy&#x27;s room often changes throughout the series, especially after the Henry character departs from the show. Still, at least one piece of WWE merchandise can be spotted in any given scene in the location. The most notable example is a pillow bearing the WWE logo. However, in the last few season five episodes, the pillow is turned over, hiding the logo. Jimmy&#x27;s room also features a vintage Indianapolis Speedway poster (dated May 30, 1914), a dartboard, a small basketball hoop and at times featured a &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; poster and posters of bands such as Less Than Jake and Green Day.

Lily&#x27;s room has a computer, a snowboarding poster, and a scrapbook poster, in addition to other commonplace items that change throughout the series. In early episodes, she has several signs featuring Justin Timberlake and NSYNC.

==Episodes==

Two episodes from Season 3, &quot;Oh, What a Knight&quot; and &quot;Part-Time Lover,&quot; were not broadcast during the show&#x27;s original network run, and were later aired in syndication on ABC Family.

==Production==
The series began as a single-camera comedy when it was ordered by Fox in May 2000 as a midseason replacement. The series&#x27; early episodes reflect this in their style and the late addition of a laugh track; by September, the network was reworking the series into a multi-camera sitcom. However, single-camera shooting styles were incorporated into certain scenes even after the development format shift, principally those shot in outdoor settings, close-ups shot in indoor sets, and tracking shots between set pieces. In December 2000, Fox cancelled the sitcom &quot;Normal, Ohio&quot; and announced that &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; would premiere in its place in January 2001.

Upon the looming threat of a writers strike, and impressed by the early ratings, Fox ordered seven additional episodes in February 2001 that would be delayed to the Fall in the case of a strike. In May 2001, Fox renewed the series for a second season, with five of the additional ordered episodes airing as part of the second season. In December, Fox cut the episode order of the second season by two episodes.

In May 2002, Fox renewed the series for a third season consisting of 13 episodes. However, after airing the first two episodes of the season, Fox continually delayed the series&#x27; return. Finally, on November 18, Carsey-Werner announced that the series would be moving to The WB within the same season, with an additional six episodes ordered; Fox would receive a cut of future syndication profits in exchange for the move. Fox aired three more episodes before the series went on hiatus in December. The WB premiered new episodes beginning February 28.

The WB renewed the series for a 22 episode fourth season in April 2003. The network delayed the additional six-episode order to air within the fourth season, creating a larger 28 episode season. In May 2004, the network renewed the series for a 13-episode fifth season. On October 26, the network announced that it would not order a full season, effectively cancelling the series.

==Reception==
===Nielsen Ratings===
===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Grounded for Life&quot; has been nominated for several Young Artist Awards for best TV comedy choice, best family TV comedy series, best performance by a guest star in a TV comedy series, and best-supporting actor in a comedy or drama series, it has also won a Young Artist Award for supporting young actor in a TV comedy series. It has also been nominated for an Artios Award, Teen Choice Award, GLAAD Media Award and an Emmy Award.

==Syndication==

===United States===

The series aired in syndication on ABC Family (now Freeform) on an intermittent basis since 2005, having gone through several timeslot changes during its run on the network. When first aired on ABC Family, the tag scenes were edited out; but when ABC Family re-acquired &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;, newer prints with the tag scenes are now shown.

On November 16, 2009, MTV began to air the show at random during the week Unlike ABC Family&#x27;s airings, these airings are the same episodes and are aired more frequently.

In February 2015, all five seasons of the show were added to Netflix for instant play. They are presented in HD for the first time, as they were only shown in standard definition in their network and cable runs.

Laff aired reruns of the show from May 2016, until December 31, 2018, but was added back in 2024.

On August 3, 2017, Amazon added all five seasons in HD through its Prime video service through a distribution deal with FilmRise.

===International===
==Home media==
The entire series of &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; has been released on DVD; Anchor Bay Entertainment originally held distribution rights to the series, releasing all five seasons in individual sets between 2006 and 2007. For the first two seasons, Anchor Bay opted to release in their originally produced episodes of 20 and 17, respectively, as opposed to the original broadcast of 15 and 22 episodes. The new opening credits introduced in the second season still remain intact for the five restored episodes on the Season One set.

The series was acquired by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2011 who released only the first two seasons, both in their original broadcast episodes, before making the series available in it entirety.

The series has also been made available on DVD in the United Kingdom, Australia and Germany, with all episodes consisting of their original broadcast episodes. All releases available contain the two unaired episodes from the third season.

==British remake==
In 2011, the show was remade by the BBC as &quot;In with the Flynns.&quot; Six episodes were produced for its first season, using stories and scenes from the American series. A six-episode second season used original stories.

<doc id="446585" wikidata="Q752398" url="?curid=446585" title="Red-wattled lapwing">
<text>The red-wattled lapwing (Vanellus indicus) is an Asian lapwing or large plover, a wader in the family Charadriidae. Like other lapwings they are ground birds that are incapable of perching. Their characteristic loud alarm calls are indicators of human or animal movements and the sounds have been variously rendered as &quot;did he do it&quot; or &quot;pity to do it&quot; leading to the colloquial name of &quot;did-he-do-it&quot; bird. Usually seen in pairs or small groups not far from water, they sometimes form large aggregations in the non-breeding season (winter). They nest in a ground scrape laying three to four camouflaged eggs. Adults near the nest fly around, diving at potential predators while calling noisily. The cryptically patterned chicks hatch and immediately follow their parents to feed, hiding by lying low on the ground or in the grass when threatened.

==Taxonomy==

Traditionally well known to native hunters, the red-wattled lapwing was first described in a book by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; in 1781. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert used the binomial name &quot;Tringa indica&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The type locality is Goa in western India. It was subsequently placed in various other genera such as &quot;Sarcogrammus&quot; and &quot;Lobivanellus&quot; before being merged into &quot;Vanellus&quot; which was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. &quot;Vanellus&quot; is the Medieval Latin for a &quot;lapwing&quot;. It is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;vanus&quot; meaning &quot;winnowing&quot; or &quot;fan&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;indicus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;India&quot;.

Across their wide range there are slight differences in the plumage and there are four recognized subspecies:
* &quot;V. i. aigneri&quot; (Laubmann, 1913) – southeast Turkey to Pakistan
* &quot;V. i. indicus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – central Pakistan to Nepal, northeast India and Bangladesh
* &quot;V. i. lankae&quot; (Koelz, 1939) – Sri Lanka
* &quot;V. i. atronuchalis&quot; (Jerdon, 1864) – northeast India to south China, southeast Asia, Malay Peninsula and north Sumatra

==Description==
Red-wattled lapwings are large waders, about long. The wings and back are light brown with a purple to green sheen, but the head, a bib on the front and back of the neck are black. Prominently white patch runs between these two colours, from belly and tail, flanking the neck to the sides of crown. Short tail is tipped black. A red fleshy wattle in front of each eye, black-tipped red bill, and the long legs are yellow. In flight, prominent white wing bars formed by the white on the secondary coverts.

Race &quot;aigneri&quot; is slightly paler and larger than the nominate race and is found in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Indus valley. The nominate race is found all over India. The Sri Lankan race &quot;lankae&quot; is smaller and dark while &quot;atronuchalis&quot; the race in north-eastern India and eastern Bangladesh has a white cheek surrounded by black.

Males and females are similar in plumage but males have a 5% longer wing and tend to have a longer carpal spur. The length of the birds is 320–350 mm, wing of 208–247 mm with the nominate averaging 223 mm, Sri Lanka 217 mm. The Bill is 31–36 mm and tarsus of 70–83 mm. Tail length is 104–128 mm.

It usually keeps in pairs or trios in well-watered open country, ploughed fields, grazing land, and margins and dry beds of tanks and puddles. They occasionally form large flocks, ranging from 26 to 200 birds. It is also found in forest clearings around rain-filled depressions. It runs about in short spurts and dips forward obliquely (with unflexed legs) to pick up food in a typical plover manner. They are said to feed at night being especially active around the full moon. Is uncannily and ceaselessly vigilant, day or night, and is the first to detect intrusions and raise an alarm, and was therefore considered a nuisance by hunters. Flight rather slow, with deliberate flaps, but capable of remarkable agility when defending nest or being hunted by a hawk.

Its striking appearance is supplemented by its noisy nature, with a loud and scolding &quot;did-he-do-it&quot; call, uttered both in the day and night.

Leucistic abnormal plumages have been noted.

The local names are mainly onomatopoeic in origin and include (Hindi), (Marathi), (Kannada), (Sindhi), (Gujarati), (Kashmiri), (Assamese), (Telugu), (Tamil, meaning &quot;human indicator&quot;).

==Distribution==
It breeds from West Asia (Iraq, SW Iran, Persian Gulf) eastwards across South Asia (Baluchistan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the entire Indian subcontinent up to Kanyakumari and up to 1800m in Kashmir/Nepal), with another sub-species further east in Southeast Asia. May migrate altitudinally in spring and autumn (e.g. in N. Baluchistan or NW Pakistan), and spreads out widely in the monsoons on creation of requisite habitats, but by and large the populations are resident.

This species is declining in its western range, but is abundant in much of South Asia, being seen at almost any wetland habitat in its range.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The breeding season is mainly March to August. The courtship involves the male puffing its feathers and pointing its beak upwards. The male then shuffles around the female. Several males may display to females and they may be close together. The eggs are laid in a ground scrape or depression sometimes fringed with pebbles, goat or hare droppings. About 3–4 black-blotched buff eggs shaped a bit like a peg-top (), 42x30 mm on average. Nests are difficult to find since the eggs are cryptically coloured and usually matches the ground pattern. In residential areas, they sometimes take to nesting on roof-tops. They have been recorded nesting on the stones between the rails of a railway track, the adult leaving the nest when trains passed. Nests that have been threatened by agricultural operations have been manually translocated by gradually shifting the eggs. When nesting they will attempt to dive bomb or distract potential predators. Both the male and female incubate the eggs and divert predators using distraction displays or flash their wings to deter any herbivores that threaten the nest. Males appear to relieve females incubating at the nest particularly towards the hot part of noon. The eggs hatch in 28 to 30 days. The reproductive success is about 40%. Egg mortality is high (~43%) due to predation by mongooses, crows and kites. Chicks have a lower mortality (8.3%) and their survival improves after the first week.

Like other lapwings, they soak their belly feathers to provide water to their chicks as well as to cool the eggs during hot weather.

They bathe in pools of water when available and will often spend time on preening when leaving the nest or after copulation. They sometimes rest on the ground with the tarsi laid flat on the ground and at other times may rest on one leg.

Healthy adult birds have few predators and are capable of rapid and agile flight when pursued by hawks or falcons. Hugh B. Cott claimed that the flesh of the bird was unpalatable based on evidence from an Indian geologist who noted that a hungry tiger cub refused to eat their meat. Some endoparasitic tapeworms, nematodes, and trematodes have been described from the species. Mortality caused by respiratory infection by &quot;Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale&quot; has been recorded in captive birds in Pakistan.

===Diet===
The diet of the lapwing includes a range of insects, snails and other invertebrates, mostly picked from the ground. They may also feed on some grains. They feed mainly during the day but they may also feed at night. They may sometimes make use of the legs to disturb insect prey from soft soil.

==In culture==
In parts of India, a local belief is that the bird sleeps on its back with the legs upwards and an associated Hindi metaphor &quot;Titahri se asman thama jayega&quot; (&quot;can the lapwing support the heavens?&quot;) is used to refer to persons undertaking tasks beyond their ability or strength.

In parts of Rajasthan it is believed that the laying of eggs by the lapwing on high ground was an indication of good rains to come. The eggs are known to be collected by practitioners of folk medicine. The Bhils of Malwa believed that the laying of eggs by red-wattled lapwings in the dry beds of streams as forewarnings of delayed rains or droughts. Eggs laid on the banks on the other hand were taken as indications of normal rains.

<doc id="446594" wikidata="Q7682682" url="?curid=446594" title="Tang dynasty art">
<text>Tang dynasty art () refers to Chinese art created during the Tang dynasty (618–907). The period saw significant advancements in arts such as painting, sculpture, calligraphy, music, dance, and literature. During the Tang dynasty, the capital city Chang&#x27;an (today&#x27;s Xi&#x27;an), was the most populous city in the known world, and the era is generally regarded by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization and a golden age of Chinese literature and art.

In several areas developments during the Tang set the direction for many centuries to come. This was especially so in pottery, with glazed plain wares in celadon green and whitish porcelaineous types brought to a high level, and exported on a considerable scale. In painting, the period saw the peak level of Buddhist painting, and the emergence of the landscape painting tradition known as &quot;shanshui&quot; (mountain-water) painting.

Trading along the Silk Road of various products increased cultural diversity in small China cities. Stimulated by contact with India and the Middle East, the empire saw a flowering of creativity in many fields. Buddhism, originating in what is modern day India around the time of Confucius, continued to flourish during the Tang period and was adopted by the imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. Block printing made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.

Culturally, the An Lushan Rebellion of 745-763 weakened the confidence of the elite, and brought an end to the lavish style of tomb figures, as well as reducing the outward-looking culture of the early Tang, that was receptive to foreign influences from further west in Asia. The Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, in fact against all foreign religions, which reached its peak in 845, had a great impact on all the arts, but especially the visual arts, greatly reducing demand for artists.

==Painting==
A considerable amount of literary and documentary information about Tang painting has survived, but very few works, especially of the highest quality. There is a good deal of biographical information and art criticism, mostly from later periods such as the Ming dynasty, several centuries after the Tang; the accuracy of this needs to be considered, and much of it was probably already based on seeing copies of the art, not originals. With a very few exceptions, traditional attributions of particular scroll paintings to Tang masters are now regarded with suspicion by art historians.

A walled-up cave in the Dunhuang (Mogao Caves) complex was discovered by Aurel Stein, which contained a vast haul, mostly of Buddhist writings, but also some banners and paintings, making much the largest group of paintings on silk to survive. These are now in the British Museum and elsewhere. They are not of court quality, but show a variety of styles, including those with influences from further west. As with sculpture, other survivals showing Tang style are in Japan, though the most important, at Nara, was very largely destroyed in a fire in 1949.

The rock-cut cave complexes and royal tombs also contain many wall-paintings; the paintings in the Qianling Mausoleum are the most important group of the latter, mostly now removed to a museum. Not all the royal tombs have yet been opened. Court painting mostly survives in what are certainly or arguably copies from much later, such as &quot;Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy&quot;, probably a later copy of the 7th century original by Yan Liben, though the front section of the famous portrait of the Emperor Xuanzong&#x27;s horse &quot;Night-Shining White&quot; is probably an original by Han Gan of 740–760. Yan Liben is an example of a famous painter who was also a very important official.

Most Tang artists outlined figures with fine black lines and used brilliant color and elaborate detail filling in the outlines. However, Wu Daozi used only black ink and freely painted brushstrokes to create ink paintings that were so exciting that crowds gathered to watch him work. From his time on, ink paintings were no longer thought to be preliminary sketches or outlines to be filled in with color. Instead, they were valued as finished works of art.

The Tang dynasty saw the maturity of the landscape painting tradition known as &quot;shanshui&quot; (mountain-water) painting, which became the most prestigious type of Chinese painting, especially when practiced by amateur scholar-official or &quot;literati&quot; painters in ink-wash painting. In these landscapes, usually monochromatic and sparse, the purpose was not to reproduce exactly the appearance of nature but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere so as to catch the &quot;rhythm&quot; of nature.

==Pottery==

Chinese ceramics saw many significant developments, including the first Chinese porcelain meeting both Western and Chinese definitions of porcelain, in Ding ware and related types. The earthenware Tang dynasty tomb figures are better known in the West today, but were only made to placed in elite tombs close to the capital in the north, between about 680 and 760. They were perhaps the last significant fine earthenwares to be produced in China. Many are lead-glazed &quot;sancai&quot; (three-colour) wares; others are unpainted or were painted over a slip; the paint has now often fallen off.

Sancai was also used for vessels for burial, and perhaps for use; the glaze was less toxic than in the Han, but perhaps still to be avoided for use at the dining table. The typical shape is the &quot;offering tray&quot;, a round or circular and lobed shape with geometrically regular floral-type decoration in the centre.

In the south the wares from the Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site in Tongguan are significant as the first regular use of underglaze painting; examples have been found in many places in the Islamic world. However the production tailed off and underglaze painting remained a minor technique for several centuries.

Yue ware was the leading high-fired, lime-glazed celadon of the period, and was of very sophisticated design, patronized by the court. This was also the case with the northern porcelains of kilns in the provinces of Henan and Hebei, which for the first time met the Western as well as the Eastern definition of porcelain, being a pure white and translucent. One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in the &quot;Chain of Chronicles&quot; written by the Arab traveler and merchant Suleiman in 851 AD during the Tang dynasty who recorded that: 
The Arabs were well used to glass, and he was certain that the porcelain that he saw was not that.

Yaozhou ware or Northern Celadon also began under the Tang, though like Ding ware its best period was under the next Song dynasty.

==Sculpture==

Most sculpture before the official rejection of Buddhism in 845 was religious, and a vast amount was destroyed during the Tang period itself, with most of the rest lost in later periods. There were many bronze and wooden sculptures, whose style is best seen in the survivals in Japanese temples. Monumental sculpture in stone, and also terracotta, has survived at several complexes of rock-cut temples, of which the largest and most famous are the Longmen Grottoes and the Mogao Caves (at Dunhuang), both of which were at their peak of expansion during the Tang. The best combined &quot;the Indian feeling for solid, swelling form and the Chinese genius for expression in terms of linear rhythm ... to produce a style which was to become the basis of all later Buddhist sculpture in China.&quot;

The tomb-figures are discussed above; though probably not treated very seriously as art by their producers, and sometimes rather sloppily made, and especially painted, they remain vigorous and effective as sculpture, especially when animals and foreigners are depicted, the latter with an element of caricature. A rather different class and type of tomb sculpture is seen in the reliefs of the six favourite horses at the mausoleum of Emperor Taizong (d. 649). By tradition these were designed by the court painter Yan Liben, and the relief is so flat and linear that it seems likely they were carved after drawings or paintings.

==Metalwork and decorative arts==

Tang elite metalwork, surviving mostly in bronze or silver cups and mirrors, is often of superb quality, decorated using a variety of techniques, and often inlaid with gold and other metals. An exceptionally fine deposit is the collection in the Tōdai-ji in Nara in Japan of the personal goods of Emperor Shōmu, given to the Buddhist shrine by his daughter Empress Kōmyō after her father&#x27;s death in 756. As well as metalwork, paintings and calligraphy, this includes furniture, glass, lacquer and wood pieces such as musical instruments and board games. Most is probably made in China, though some is Japanese and some from the Middle East.

Another important deposit was discovered in 1970 at Xi&#x27;an when the Hejia Village hoard was uncovered by construction. Placed into two large ceramic pots, 64 cm high, and a silver one, 25 cm high, this was a large collection of over a thousand objects, altogether representing a rather puzzling collection. Several of them were gold or silver vessels and other objects of the highest quality, as well as hardstone carvings in jade and agate, and gemstones. It was probably hidden in a hurry during the An Lushan revolt, in which the Tang capital was taken more than once. Many of the objects are imported, mostly from along the Silk Road, especially Sogdia, and others show Sogdian influence. Two objects from the hoard (illustrated) are included on the very select official list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad. The hoard is now in the Shaanxi History Museum.

==Architecture==

There had been an enormous amount of building of Buddhist temples and monasteries, but in 845 these were all confiscated by the government, and the great majority destroyed. The normal construction material for buildings other than towers, pagodas, and military works in the Tang was still wood, which does not survive very long if not maintained. The rock-cut architecture of the famous surviving sites of course survives neglect far better, but the Chinese generally left the external facades of cave-temples unornamented, unlike the Indian equivalents at sites like the Ajanta Caves.

Two large Tang pagodas survive in the capital, now Xi&#x27;an, which otherwise has few remains dating back to the Tang. The oldest is the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda, rebuilt in 704 in brick, and reduced in height after damage in the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake. The Small Wild Goose Pagoda was also rebuilt in 704, but only lost a few metres in the earthquake. Some Tang pagodas tried to reconcile the form with the Indian shikara temple tower, or even had a stupa as part of the superstructure; the Tahōtō at the Ishiyama-dera temple in Japan is a surviving later example, with a roof on top of the stupa.

The main hall of the relatively small rural Nanchan Temple has a main structure of wood. Much of it appears to have survived from the original construction in 782, and it is recognised as the oldest wooden building in China. The third oldest is the main hall of the nearby Foguang Temple of 857.

Both are studied for their &quot;dougong&quot; bracketing systems, joining the roof to the walls. These complicated arrangements persisted until the end of traditional Chinese architecture, but are often considered to have reached a peak of elegance and harmony in the Song and Yuan dynasties, before becoming over-elaborate and fussy. The Tang examples show an increase in complexity before the great periods, and the beginnings of the uplift at the edges of roof lines that was to grow stronger in later periods. Japan has preserved rather more temple halls built in very similar styles (or in many cases has carefully rebuilt them as exact replicas over the centuries).

==Music==
The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the qin during the Tang dynasty, though the qin is known to have been played since before the Han dynasty.

Late 20th century excavations of an intact tomb of the period revealed not only a number of instruments (including a spectacular concert bell set) but also inscribed tablets with playing instructions and musical scores for ensemble concerts, which are now heard again as played on reproduction instruments at the Hubei Provincial Museum.

==Opera==
Chinese opera is generally dated back to the Tang dynasty with Emperor Xuanzong (712–755), who founded the Pear Garden, the first known opera troupe in China. The troupe mostly performed for the emperors&#x27; personal pleasure.

==Poetry==
The poetry of the Tang dynasty is perhaps the most highly regarded poetic era in Chinese poetry. The &quot;shi&quot;, the classical form of poetry which had developed in the late Han dynasty, reached its zenith. The anthology &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot;, compiled much later, remains famous in China.

During the Tang dynasty, poetry became popular, and writing poetry was considered a sign of learning. One of China&#x27;s greatest poets was Li Po, who wrote about ordinary people and about nature, which was a powerful force in Chinese art. One of Li Po&#x27;s short poems, &quot;Waterfall at Lu-Shan&quot;, shows how Li Po felt about nature.

<doc id="446596" wikidata="Q589284" url="?curid=446596" title="Diving reflex">
<text>The diving reflex, also known as the diving response and mammalian diving reflex, is a set of physiological responses to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes, and is found in all air-breathing vertebrates studied to date. It optimizes respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, enabling submersion for an extended time.

The diving reflex is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals, such as seals, otters, dolphins, and muskrats, and exists as a lesser response in other animals, including human babies up to 6 months old (see infant swimming), and diving birds, such as ducks and penguins. Adult humans generally exhibit a mild response, the dive-hunting Sama-Bajau people being a notable outlier.

The diving reflex is triggered specifically by chilling and wetting the nostrils and face while breath-holding, and is sustained via neural processing originating in the carotid chemoreceptors. The most noticeable effects are on the cardiovascular system, which displays peripheral vasoconstriction, slowed heart rate, redirection of blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, release of red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, heart rhythm irregularities. Although aquatic animals have evolved profound physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, the apnea and its duration, bradycardia, vasoconstriction, and redistribution of cardiac output occur also in terrestrial animals as a neural response, but the effects are more profound in natural divers.

== Physiological response ==

When the face is submerged and water fills the nostrils, sensory receptors sensitive to wetness within the nasal cavity and other areas of the face supplied by the fifth (V) cranial nerve (the trigeminal nerve) relay the information to the brain. The tenth (X) cranial nerve, (the vagus nerve) – part of the autonomic nervous system – then produces bradycardia and other neural pathways elicit peripheral vasoconstriction, restricting blood from limbs and all organs to preserve blood and oxygen for the heart and the brain (and lungs), concentrating flow in a heart–brain circuit and allowing the animal to conserve oxygen.

In humans, the diving reflex is not induced when limbs are introduced to cold water. Mild bradycardia is caused by subjects holding their breath without submerging the face in water. When breathing with the face submerged, the diving response increases proportionally to decreasing water temperature. However, the greatest bradycardia effect is induced when the subject is holding their breath with their face wetted. Apnea with nostril and facial cooling are triggers of this reflex.

The diving response in animals, such as the dolphin, varies considerably depending on level of exertion during foraging. Children tend to survive longer than adults when deprived of oxygen underwater. The exact mechanism for this effect has been debated and may be a result of brain cooling similar to the protective effects seen in people treated with deep hypothermia.

===Carotid body chemoreceptors===
During sustained breath-holding while submerged, blood oxygen levels decline while carbon dioxide and acidity levels rise, stimuli that collectively act upon chemoreceptors located in the bilateral carotid bodies. As sensory organs, the carotid bodies convey the chemical status of the circulating blood to brain centers regulating neural outputs to the heart and circulation. Preliminary evidence in ducks and humans indicates that the carotid bodies are essential for these integrated cardiovascular responses of the diving response, establishing a &quot;chemoreflex&quot; characterized by parasympathetic (slowing) effects on the heart and sympathetic (vasoconstrictor) effects on the vascular system.

===Circulatory responses===
Plasma fluid losses due to immersion diuresis occur within a short period of immersion.
Head-out immersion causes a blood shift from the limbs and into the thorax. The fluid shift is largely from the extravascular tissues and the increased atrial volume results in a compensatory diuresis. Plasma volume, stroke volume, and cardiac output remain higher than normal during immersion. The increased respiratory and cardiac workload causes increased blood flow to the cardiac and respiratory muscles. Stroke volume is not greatly affected by immersion or variation in ambient pressure, but bradycardia reduces the overall cardiac output, particularly due to the diving reflex in breath-hold diving.

====Bradycardia and cardiac output====
Bradycardia is the response to facial contact with cold water: the human heart rate slows down ten to twenty-five percent. Seals experience changes that are even more dramatic, going from about 125 beats per minute to as low as 10 on an extended dive. During breath-holding, humans also display reduced left ventricular contractility and diminished cardiac output, effects that may be more severe during submersion due to hydrostatic pressure.

Slowing the heart rate reduces the cardiac oxygen consumption, and compensates for the hypertension due to vasoconstriction. However, breath-hold time is reduced when the whole body is exposed to cold water as the metabolic rate increases to compensate for accelerated heat loss even when the heart rate is significantly slowed.

====Splenic contraction====
The spleen contracts in response to lowered levels of oxygen and increased levels of carbon dioxide, releasing red blood cells and increasing the oxygen capacity of the blood. This may start before the bradycardia.

====Blood shift====
&quot;Blood shift&quot; is a term used when blood flow to the extremities is redistributed to the head and torso during a breath-hold dive. Peripheral vasoconstriction occurs during submersion by resistance vessels limiting blood flow to muscles, skin, and viscera, regions which are &quot;hypoxia-tolerant&quot;, thereby preserving oxygenated blood for the heart, lungs, and brain. The increased resistance to peripheral blood flow raises the blood pressure, which is compensated by bradycardia, conditions which are accentuated by cold water. Aquatic mammals have blood volume that is some three times larger per mass than in humans, a difference augmented by considerably more oxygen bound to hemoglobin and myoglobin of diving mammals, enabling prolongation of submersion after capillary blood flow in peripheral organs is minimized.

====Arrhythmias====
Cardiac arrhythmias are a common characteristic of the human diving response. As part of the diving reflex, increased activity of the cardiac parasympathetic nervous system not only regulates the bradycardia, but also is associated with ectopic beats which are characteristic of human heart function during breath-hold dives. Arrhythmias may be accentuated by neural responses to face immersion in cold water, distension of the heart due to central blood shift, and the increasing resistance to left ventricular ejection (afterload) by rising blood pressure. Other changes commonly measured in the electrocardiogram during human breath-hold dives include ST depression, heightened T wave, and a positive U wave following the QRS complex, measurements associated with reduced left ventricular contractility and overall depressed cardiac function during a dive.

===Renal and water balance responses===
In hydrated subjects, immersion will cause diuresis and excretion of sodium and potassium. Diuresis is reduced in dehydrated subjects, and in trained athletes in comparison with sedentary subjects.

===Respiratory responses===
Snorkel breathing is limited to shallow depths just below the surface due to the effort required during inhalation to overcome the hydrostatic pressure on the chest. Hydrostatic pressure on the surface of the body due to head-out immersion in water causes negative pressure breathing which shifts blood into the intrathoracic circulation.

Lung volume decreases in the upright position due to cranial displacement of the abdomen due to hydrostatic pressure, and resistance to air flow in the airways increases significantly because of the decrease in lung volume.

Hydrostatic pressure differences between the interior of the lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.

There appears to be a connection between pulmonary edema and increased pulmonary blood flow and pressure which results in capillary engorgement. This may occur during higher intensity exercise while immersed or submersed.

Facial immersion at the time of initiating breath-hold is a necessary factor for maximising the mammalian diving reflex in humans.

==Adaptations of aquatic mammals==

Diving mammals have an elastic aortic bulb thought to help maintain arterial pressure during the extended intervals between heartbeats during dives, and have high blood volume, combined with large storage capacity in veins and retes of the thorax and head in seals and dolphins. Chronic physiological adaptations of blood include elevated hematocrit, hemoglobin, and myoglobin levels which enable greater oxygen storage and delivery to essential organs during a dive. Oxygen use is minimised during the diving reflex by energy-efficient swimming or gliding behaviour, and regulation of metabolism, heart rate, and peripheral vasoconstriction.

Aerobic diving capacity is limited by available oxygen and the rate at which it is consumed. Diving mammals and birds have a considerably greater blood volume than terrestrial animals of similar size, and in addition have a far greater concentration of haemoglobin and myoglobin, and this haemoglobin and myoglobin is also capable of carrying a higher oxygen load. During diving, the hematocrit and hemoglobin are temporarily increased by reflex splenic contraction, which discharges a large additional amount of red blood cells. The brain tissue of diving mammals also contains higher levels of neuroglobin and cytoglobin than terrestrial animals.

Aquatic mammals seldom dive beyond their aerobic diving limit, which is related to the myoglobin oxygen stored. The muscle mass of aquatic mammals is relatively large, so the high myoglobin content of their skeletal muscles provides a large reserve. Myoglobin-bound oxygen is only released in relatively hypoxic muscle tissue, so the peripheral vasoconstriction due to the diving reflex makes the muscles ischaemic and promotes early use of myoglobin bound oxygen.

== History ==
The diving bradycardia was first described by Edmund Goodwyn in 1786 and later by Paul Bert in 1870.

<doc id="446597" wikidata="Q3264399" url="?curid=446597" title="Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson">
<text>Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson (6 August 1862 – 3 August 1932), known as Goldie, was a British political scientist and philosopher. He lived most of his life at Cambridge, where he wrote a dissertation on Neoplatonism before becoming a fellow. He was closely associated with the Bloomsbury Group.

Dickinson was deeply distressed by Britain&#x27;s involvement in the First World War. Within a fortnight of the war&#x27;s breaking out, he drew up the idea of a League of Nations, and his subsequent writings helped to shape public opinion towards the creation of the League. 

Within the field of international relations, Dickinson is prominent for popularizing conceptions of the international system as being an international &quot;anarchy.&quot; In contrast to many of his contemporaries who attributed the causes of war to national and imperial expansion or to population growth, Dickinson argued that war was rooted in fear and suspicion caused by anarchy and arms races.

==Life==
===Early years===
Dickinson was born in London, the son of Lowes Cato Dickinson (1819–1908), a portrait painter, by his marriage to Margaret Ellen Williams, a daughter of William Smith Williams who was a literary advisor to Smith, Elder &amp; Company and had discovered Charlotte Brontë. When the boy was about one year old his family moved to the Spring Cottage in Hanwell, then a country village. The family also included his brother, Arthur, three years older, an older sister, May, and two younger sisters, Hester and Janet.

His education included attendance at a day school in Somerset Street, Portman Square, when he was ten or eleven. At about the age of twelve, he was sent to Beomonds, a boarding school in Chertsey, and his teenage years from 14 to 19 were spent at Charterhouse School in Godalming, where his brother Arthur had preceded him. He was unhappy at Charterhouse, although he enjoyed seeing plays put on by visiting actors, and he played the violin in the school orchestra. While he was there, his family moved from Hanwell to a house behind All Souls Church in Langham Place.

In 1881 Dickinson went up to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, as an exhibitioner, where his brother, Arthur, had again preceded him. Near the end of his first year, he received a telegram informing him that his mother had died from asthma. During his college years, his tutor, Oscar Browning, was a strong influence on him, and Dickinson became a close friend of his fellow King&#x27;s undergraduate C. R. Ashbee. Dickinson won the chancellor&#x27;s English medal in 1884 for a poem on Savonarola, and in graduating that summer he was awarded a first-class degree in the Classical Tripos.

After travelling in the Netherlands and Germany, Dickinson returned to Cambridge late that year and was elected to the Cambridge Conversazione Society, better known as the Cambridge Apostles. In a year or two he was part of the circle that included Roger Fry, J. M. E. McTaggart, and Nathaniel Wedd.

===Career===

In the summer of 1885, he worked at a co-operative farm, Craig Farm at Tilford near Farnham in Surrey. The farm had been started by Harold Cox as an experiment in simple living. Dickinson was proud of his hoeing, digging, and ploughing. That autumn, and continuing to the spring of 1886, Dickinson joined the University Extension Scheme to give public lectures that covered Carlyle, Emerson, Browning, and Tennyson. He toured the country, living for a term at Mansfield and for a second term at Chester and Southport. He spent a brief time in Wales afterwards.

With financial help from his father, Dickinson then began to study for a medical degree, beginning in October 1886 at Cambridge. Although he became dissatisfied with his new subject and nearly decided to drop out, he persevered and passed his M.B. examinations in 1887 and 1888. Yet he finally decided he was not interested in a career in medicine.

In March 1887 a dissertation on Plotinus helped his election to a fellowship at King&#x27;s College. During Roger Fry&#x27;s last year at Cambridge (1887–1888), Dickinson, a homosexual, fell in love with him. After an initially intense relationship (which according to Dickinson&#x27;s biography did not include sex with Fry, a heterosexual), the two established a long friendship. Through Fry, Dickinson soon met Jack McTaggart and F. C. S. Schiller.

Dickinson then settled down at Cambridge, although he again lectured through the University Extension Scheme, travelling to Newcastle, Leicester, and Norwich. His fellowship at King&#x27;s College (as a historian) was permanently renewed in 1896. That year his book &quot;The Greek View of Life&quot; was published. He later wrote a number of dialogues in the Socratic tradition.

Dickinson did not live the detached life of a stereotypical Cambridge academic. When G. K. Chesterton chose contemporary thinkers with whom he disagreed for his book &quot;Heretics&quot; (1905), the focus of Chapter 12 was &quot;Paganism and Mr. Lowes Dickinson&quot;. There Chesterton writes:

Mr. Lowes Dickinson, the most pregnant and provocative of recent writers on this and similar subjects, is far too solid a man to have fallen into this old error of the mere anarchy of Paganism. To make hay of that Hellenic enthusiasm which has as its ideal mere appetite and egotism, it is not necessary to know much philosophy, but merely to know a little Greek. Mr. Lowes Dickinson knows a great deal of philosophy, and also a great deal of Greek, and his error, if error he has, is not that of the crude hedonist. But the contrast which he offers between Christianity and Paganism in the matter of moral ideals—a contrast which he states very ably in a paper called &quot;How Long Halt Ye?&quot; which appeared in the &quot;Independent Review&quot;—does, I think, contain an error of a deeper kind.

Dickinson was a lecturer in political science from 1886 to his retirement in 1920, and the college librarian from 1893 to 1896. Dickinson helped establish the Economics and Politics Tripos and taught political science within the University. For 15 years he also lectured at the London School of Economics.

In 1897 he made his first trip to Greece, travelling with Nathaniel Wedd, Robin Mayor, and A. M. Daniel.

He joined the Society for Psychical Research in 1890, and served on its Council from 1904 to 1920.

In 1903 he helped to found the &quot;Independent Review&quot;. Edward Jenks was editor, and members of its editorial board included Dickinson, F. W. Hirst, C. F. G. Masterman, G. M. Trevelyan, and Nathaniel Wedd. Fry designed the front cover. Over the years Dickinson contributed a number of articles to it, some later reprinted in &quot;Religion: A Criticism and a Forecast&quot; (1905) and &quot;Religion and Immortality&quot; (1911).

===First World War and after===
Within a fortnight of the start of the First World War, Dickinson had drafted schemes for a &quot;League of Nations&quot;, and together with Lord Dickinson and Lord Bryce he planned the ideas behind of the League of Nations and played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group. The organisation eventually became the nucleus of the League of Nations Union. In his pamphlet &quot;After the War&quot; (1915) he wrote of his &quot;League of Peace&quot; as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war and thus could write that, &quot;the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion.&quot; Dickinson promoted his ideas with a large number of books and pamphlets, including his book &quot;The International Anarchy&quot;. He also attended a pacifist conference in The Hague in 1915, and in 1916 he set off on a lecture tour of the United States promoting the idea of a League of Nations.

In the 1920s, Dickinson joined the Labour Party, and he was appointed to the party&#x27;s Advisory Committee on International Questions. In 1929, the Talks Department of the BBC invited him to give the first and last lectures in a series called &quot;Points of View&quot;. He went on to give several series of BBC talks on various topics, including Goethe and Plato.

===Death and legacy===
After a prostate operation in 1932, Dickinson appeared to be recovering, but he died on 3 August. Memorial services were held in King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge, and in London.

E. M. Forster, by then a good friend, who had been influenced by Dickinson&#x27;s books, accepted the appointment as Dickinson&#x27;s literary executor. Dickinson&#x27;s sisters then asked Forster to write their brother&#x27;s biography, which was published as &quot;Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson&quot; in 1934. Forster has been criticised for refraining from publishing details of Dickinson&#x27;s sexual proclivities, including his foot fetishism and unrequited love for young men.

E. M. Forster stated (in &quot;the Art of Fiction&quot;) that he used Dickinsons&#x27; sisters as his inspiration for Margaret and Helen Schlegel, the central characters in &quot;Howards End&quot;.

<text>The Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex is part of the United States system of National Wildlife Refuges (NWR). It is located in northern California, in the valley of the Sacramento River.

The Sacramento NWR Complex was created in an attempt to resolve the conflict between the needs of migrating birds using the Pacific Flyway, and those of agriculture.

The Sacramento NWR Complex headquarters and visitor center is located in the 10,819-acre (4378 ha) Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge off of 99W, and features a wildlife exhibit, bookstore, and Discovery Room. Visitors can enjoy a six-mile auto tour with 3 viewing areas and two walking trails.

==History and components==
Before the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century, much of the Sacramento valley was taken up by seasonal wetlands and grasslands. By the beginning of the 20th century, much of this had been replaced by farmland, particularly for the growing of rice, and the rivers no longer create new wetlands because their flow is controlled by levees and irrigation schemes. Less than 10% of the original wetland area remains. Migrating birds have continued to use the area, and resting in the rice fields, consumed considerable quantities of the crop.

In 1937, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, with the aid of the Civilian Conservation Corps, began the process of creating a refuge within dry, alkaline lands between the towns of Willows and Maxwell. This was the original Sacramento NWR. From the 1940s onward, additional refuges were created, so that the Sacramento NWR Complex now includes the following refuges, located between north of the city of Sacramento:

* Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge (southeastern Glenn and northeastern Colusa counties, south of Willows)
* Delevan National Wildlife Refuge (east of Maxwell)
* Colusa National Wildlife Refuge (between the towns of Colusa and Williams)
* Sutter National Wildlife Refuge (southwest of Yuba City)
* Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge (several non-contiguous sites along the Sacramento River between Red Bluff and Colusa)
* Butte Sink Wildlife Management Area (northeast of the town of Colusa)
* North Central Valley Wildlife Management Area
* Willow Creek-Lurline Wildlife Management Area

The total area of the refuges is about s).

==Ecology==

The water flows in the refuge have to be controlled artificially, and the vegetation has to be managed actively through irrigation and burning, to ensure that the wetlands remain productive, and provide adequate food and resting places for the birds. Between them, the refuges provide a range of habitats: seasonal marshes, uplands, permanent ponds, and riparian areas.

The refuges are provided with facilities for visitors, though these have to be limited to avoid conflict with their primary purpose of conservation. The layout of the wetlands has been planned to allow visitors a good view of the birds while minimising the risk of disturbance to them. There is a visitor center at the Sacramento NWR, and routes for car tours on the Sacramento and Colusa sites, though visitors are allowed to leave their cars only at selected sites. There are walking trails at both those sites and also at the Sacramento River site. Limited hunting is permitted on some of the sites.

Over 300 species of birds and mammals use the refuges, not all of them migratory. Among those most likely to be seen by visitors (depending on season) are:
*Grebes: pied-billed grebe, eared grebe
*Pelicans, cormorants: American white pelican, double-crested cormorant
*Herons etc.: American bittern, great blue heron, great egret, snowy egret, black-crowned night heron, white-faced ibis
*Ducks and geese: mallard, pintail, American wigeon, cinnamon teal, green-winged teal, bufflehead, northern shoveler, ring-necked duck, wood duck, snow goose, white-fronted goose, Ross&#x27;s goose
*Raptors: turkey vulture, osprey, white-tailed kite, northern harrier, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel, golden eagle, bald eagle (the eagles are not common, but there is a chance of seeing them).
*Waders and other shorebirds: ring-necked pheasant, Virginia rail, sora, common moorhen, American coot, killdeer, black-necked stilt, American avocet, greater yellowlegs, western sandpiper, least sandpiper, dunlin, long-billed dowitcher, Wilson&#x27;s snipe
*Gulls etc.: ring-billed gull, herring gull
*Pigeons and doves: mourning dove
*Owls: great horned owl, barn owl
*Woodpeckers: Nuttall&#x27;s woodpecker, northern flicker
*Passerines: western kingbird, yellow-billed magpie, tree swallow, cliff swallow, barn swallow, marsh wren, ruby-crowned kinglet, European starling, American pipit, yellow-rumped warbler, common yellowthroat, Savannah sparrow, song sparrow, Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow, white-crowned sparrow, golden-crowned sparrow, dark-eyed junco, red-winged blackbird, western meadowlark, Brewer&#x27;s blackbird, brown-headed cowbird, Bullock&#x27;s oriole, house finch, house sparrow
*Mammals: black-tailed jackrabbit, California ground squirrel, black-tailed deer.

The Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge Complex boasts a diverse flora, even though large amounts of the historic wetland has been destroyed. Among the diverse wildflowers present is the yellow mariposa lily, &quot;Calochortus luteus&quot;.

<text>Praxis is the process by which a theory, lesson, or skill is enacted, embodied, realized, applied, or put into practice. &quot;Praxis&quot; may also refer to the act of engaging, applying, exercising, realizing, or practising ideas. This has been a recurrent topic in the field of philosophy, discussed in the writings of Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, Francis Bacon, Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, Ludwig von Mises, Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, Martin Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, Paulo Freire, Murray Rothbard, and many others. It has meaning in the political, educational, spiritual and medical realms.

==Origins==
The word &quot;praxis &quot; is from . In Ancient Greek the word praxis (πρᾶξις) referred to activity engaged in by free people. The philosopher Aristotle held that there were three basic activities of humans: &quot;theoria&quot; (thinking), &quot;poiesis&quot; (making), and &quot;praxis&quot; (doing). Corresponding to these activities were three types of knowledge: theoretical, the end goal being truth; poietical, the end goal being production; and practical, the end goal being action. Aristotle further divided the knowledge derived from praxis into ethics, economics, and politics. He also distinguished between &quot;eupraxia&quot; (εὐπραξία, &quot;good praxis&quot;) and &quot;dyspraxia&quot; (δυσπραξία, &quot;bad praxis, misfortune&quot;).

==Marxism==

Young Hegelian August Cieszkowski was one of the earliest philosophers to use the term &quot;praxis&quot; to mean &quot;action oriented towards changing society&quot; in his 1838 work &quot;Prolegomena zur Historiosophie&quot; (&quot;Prolegomena to a Historiosophy&quot;). Cieszkowski argued that while absolute truth had been achieved in the speculative philosophy of Hegel, the deep divisions and contradictions in man&#x27;s consciousness could only be resolved through concrete practical activity that directly influences social life. Although there is no evidence that Karl Marx himself read this book, it may have had an indirect influence on his thought through the writings of his friend Moses Hess.
Marx uses the term &quot;praxis&quot; to refer to the free, universal, creative and self-creative activity through which man creates and changes his historical world and himself. Praxis is an activity unique to man, which distinguishes him from all other beings. The concept appears in two of Marx&#x27;s early works: the &quot;Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844&quot; and the Theses on Feuerbach (1845). In the former work, Marx contrasts the free, conscious productive activity of human beings with the unconscious, compulsive production of animals. He also affirms the primacy of praxis over theory, claiming that theoretical contradictions can only be resolved through practical activity. In the latter work, revolutionary practice is a central theme:

Marx here criticizes the materialist philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach for envisaging objects in a contemplative way. Marx argues that perception is itself a component of man&#x27;s practical relationship to the world. To understand the world does not mean considering it from the outside, judging it morally or explaining it scientifically. Society cannot be changed by reformers who understand its needs, only by the revolutionary praxis of the mass whose interest coincides with that of society as a whole—the proletariat. This will be an act of society understanding itself, in which the subject changes the object by the very fact of understanding it.

Seemingly inspired by the Theses, the nineteenth century socialist Antonio Labriola called Marxism the &quot;philosophy of praxis&quot;. This description of Marxism would appear again in Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot; and the writings of the members of the Frankfurt School. Praxis is also an important theme for Marxist thinkers such as Georg Lukács, Karl Korsch, Karel Kosik and Henri Lefebvre, and was seen as the central concept of Marx&#x27;s thought by Yugoslavia&#x27;s Praxis School, which established a journal of that name in 1964.

==Jean-Paul Sartre==
In the &quot;Critique of Dialectical Reason&quot;, Jean-Paul Sartre posits a view of individual praxis as the basis of human history. In his view, praxis is an attempt to negate human need. In a revision of Marxism and his earlier existentialism, Sartre argues that the fundamental relation of human history is scarcity. Conditions of scarcity generate competition for resources, exploitation of one over another and division of labor, which in its turn creates struggle between classes. Each individual experiences the other as a threat to his or her own survival and praxis; it is always a possibility that one&#x27;s individual freedom limits another&#x27;s. Sartre recognizes both natural and man-made constraints on freedom: he calls the non-unified practical activity of humans the &quot;practico-inert&quot;. Sartre opposes to individual praxis a &quot;group praxis&quot; that fuses each individual to be accountable to each other in a common purpose. Sartre sees a mass movement in a successful revolution as the best exemplar of such a fused group.

==Hannah Arendt==
In &quot;The Human Condition&quot;, Hannah Arendt argues that Western philosophy too often has focused on the contemplative life (&quot;vita contemplativa&quot;) and has neglected the active life (&quot;vita activa&quot;). This has led humanity to frequently miss much of the everyday relevance of philosophical ideas to real life. For Arendt, praxis is the highest and most important level of the active life. Thus, she argues that more philosophers need to engage in everyday political action or praxis, which she sees as the true realization of human freedom. According to Arendt, our capacity to analyze ideas, wrestle with them, and engage in active praxis is what makes us uniquely human.

In Maurizio Passerin d&#x27;Etreves&#x27;s estimation, &quot;Arendt&#x27;s theory of action and her revival of the ancient notion of praxis represent one of the most original contributions to twentieth century political thought. ... Moreover, by viewing action as a mode of human togetherness, Arendt is able to develop a conception of participatory democracy which stands in direct contrast to the bureaucratized and elitist forms of politics so characteristic of the modern epoch.&quot;

==Education==
Praxis is used by educators to describe a recurring passage through a cyclical process of experiential learning, such as the cycle described and popularised by David A. Kolb.

Paulo Freire defines praxis in &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; as &quot;reflection and action directed at the structures to be transformed.&quot; Through praxis, oppressed people can acquire a critical awareness of their own condition, and, with teacher-students and students-teachers, struggle for liberation.

In the British Channel 4 television documentary &quot;New Order: Play at Home&quot;, Factory Records owner Tony Wilson describes praxis as &quot;doing something, and then only afterwards, finding out why you did it&quot;.

Praxis may be described as a form of critical thinking and comprises the combination of reflection and action. Praxis can be viewed as a progression of cognitive and physical actions:
* Taking the action
* Considering the impacts of the action
* Analysing the results of the action by reflecting upon it
* Altering and revising conceptions and planning following reflection
* Implementing these plans in further actions

This creates a cycle which can be viewed in terms of educational settings, learners and educational facilitators.

Scott and Marshall (2009) refer to praxis as &quot;a philosophical term referring to human action on the natural and social world&quot;. Furthermore, Gramsci (1999) emphasises the power of praxis in Selections from the &quot;Prison Notebooks&quot; by stating that &quot;The philosophy of praxis does not tend to leave the simple in their primitive philosophy of common sense but rather to lead them to a higher conception of life&quot;.

To reveal the inadequacies of religion, folklore, intellectualism and other such &#x27;one-sided&#x27; forms of reasoning, Gramsci appeals directly in his later work to Marx&#x27;s &#x27;philosophy of praxis&#x27;, describing it as a &#x27;concrete&#x27; mode of reasoning. This principally involves the juxtaposition of a dialectical and scientific audit of reality; against all existing normative, ideological, and therefore counterfeit accounts. Essentially a &#x27;philosophy&#x27; based on &#x27;a practice&#x27;, Marx&#x27;s philosophy, is described correspondingly in this manner, as the only &#x27;philosophy&#x27; that is at the same time a &#x27;history in action&#x27; or a &#x27;life&#x27; itself (Gramsci, Hoare and Nowell-Smith, 1972, p. 332).

==Spirituality==

Praxis is also key in meditation and spirituality, where emphasis is placed on gaining first-hand experience of concepts and certain areas, such as union with the Divine, which can only be explored through praxis due to the inability of the finite mind (and its tool, language) to comprehend or express the infinite. In an interview for &quot;YES! Magazine&quot;, Matthew Fox explained it this way:

According to &quot;Strong&#x27;s Concordance&quot;, the Hebrew word &quot;ta‛am&quot; is, properly, a taste. This is, figuratively, perception and, by implication, intelligence; transitively, a mandate: advice, behaviour, decree, discretion, judgment, reason, taste, understanding.

==Medicine==
Praxis is the ability to perform voluntary skilled movements. The partial or complete inability to do so in the absence of primary sensory or motor impairments is known as apraxia.

<doc id="446606" wikidata="Q3317963" url="?curid=446606" title="Modularity of mind">
<text>Modularity of mind is the notion that a mind may, at least in part, be composed of innate neural structures or mental modules which have distinct, established, and evolutionarily developed functions. However, different definitions of &quot;module&quot; have been proposed by different authors. According to Jerry Fodor, the author of &quot;Modularity of Mind&quot;, a system can be considered &#x27;modular&#x27; if its functions are made of multiple dimensions or units to some degree. One example of modularity in the mind is &quot;binding&quot;. When one perceives an object, they take in not only the features of an object, but the integrated features that can operate in sync or independently that create a whole. Instead of just seeing &quot;red&quot;, &quot;round&quot;, &quot;plastic&quot;, and &quot;moving&quot;, the subject may experience a rolling red ball. Binding may suggest that the mind is modular because it takes multiple cognitive processes to perceive one thing.

==Early investigations==
Historically, questions regarding the &quot;functional architecture&quot; of the mind have been divided into two different theories of the nature of the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not domain specific (e.g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a vertical view because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.

The vertical vision goes back to the 19th-century movement called phrenology and its founder Franz Joseph Gall. Gall claimed that the individual mental faculties could be associated precisely, in a one-to-one correspondence, with specific physical areas of the brain. For example, someone&#x27;s level of intelligence could be literally &quot;read off&quot; from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. Phrenology&#x27;s practice was debunked scientifically by Pierre Flourens in the 19th century. He destroyed parts of pigeons&#x27; and dogs&#x27; brains, called lesions, and studied the organisms&#x27; resulting dysfunction. He was able to conclude that while the brain localizes in some functions, it also works as a unit and is not as localized as earlier phrenologists thought. Before the early 20th century, Edward Bradford Titchener studied the modules of the mind through introspection. He tried to determine the original, raw perspective experiences of his subjects. For example, if he wanted his subjects to perceive an apple, they would need to talk about spatial characteristics of the apple and the different hues that they saw without mentioning the apple.

==Fodor&#x27;s &quot;Modularity of Mind&quot;==
In the 1980s, however, Jerry Fodor revived the idea of the modularity of mind, although without the notion of precise physical localizability. Drawing from Noam Chomsky&#x27;s idea of the language acquisition device and other work in linguistics as well as from the philosophy of mind and the implications of optical illusions, he became a major proponent of the idea with the 1983 publication of &quot;Modularity of Mind&quot;.

According to Fodor, a module falls somewhere between the behaviorist and cognitivist views of lower-level processes.

Behaviorists tried to replace the mind with reflexes, which are, according to Fodor, encapsulated (cognitively impenetrable or unaffected by other cognitive domains) and non-inferential (straight pathways with no information added). Low-level processes are unlike reflexes in that they can be inferential. This can be demonstrated by poverty of the stimulus argument, which posits that children do not only learn language from their environment, but are innately programmed with low-level processes that help them seek and learn language. The proximate stimulus, that which is initially received by the brain (such as the 2D image received by the retina), cannot account for the resulting output (for example, our 3D perception of the world), thus necessitating some form of computation.

In contrast, cognitivists saw lower-level processes as continuous with higher-level processes, being inferential and cognitively penetrable (influenced by other cognitive domains, such as beliefs). The latter has been shown to be untrue in some cases, such as the Müller-Lyer illusion, which can persist despite a person&#x27;s awareness of their existence. This is taken to indicate that other domains, including one&#x27;s beliefs, cannot influence such processes.

Fodor arrives at the conclusion that such processes are inferential like higher-order processes and encapsulated in the same sense as reflexes.

Although he argued for the modularity of &quot;lower level&quot; cognitive processes in &quot;Modularity of Mind&quot; he also argued that higher-level cognitive processes are not modular since they have dissimilar properties. &quot;The Mind Doesn&#x27;t Work That Way&quot;, a reaction to Steven Pinker&#x27;s &quot;How the Mind Works&quot;, is devoted to this subject.

Fodor (1983) states that modular systems must—at least to &quot;some interesting extent&quot;—fulfill certain properties:
# Domain specificity: modules only operate on certain kinds of inputs—they are specialised
# Obligatory firing: modules process in a mandatory manner
# Limited accessibility: what central processing can access from input system representations is limited
# Fast speed: probably due to the fact that they are encapsulated (thereby needing only to consult a restricted database) and mandatory (time need not be wasted in determining whether or not to process incoming input)
# Informational encapsulation: modules need not refer to other psychological systems in order to operate
# Shallow outputs: the output of modules is very simple
# Specific breakdown patterns
# Characteristic ontogeny: there is a regularity of development
# Fixed neural architecture.

Pylyshyn (1999) has argued that while these properties tend to occur with modules, one—information encapsulation—stands out as being the real signature of a module; that is the encapsulation of the processes inside the module from both cognitive influence and from cognitive access. One example is that conscious awareness that the Müller-Lyer illusion is an illusion does not correct visual processing.

==Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity==
The definition of &quot;module&quot; has caused confusion and dispute. In J.A. Fodor&#x27;s views, modules can be found in peripheral and low-level visual processing, but not in central processing. Later, he narrowed the two essential features to &quot;domain-specificity&quot; and &quot;information encapsulation&quot;. According to Frankenhuis and Ploeger, domain-specificity means that &quot;a given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information&quot;. Information encapsulation means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information in the rest of the brain. One example is that the effects of an optical illusion, created by low-level processes, persist despite high-level processing caused by conscious awareness of the illusion itself.

Other perspectives on modularity come from evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychologists propose that the mind is made up of genetically influenced and domain-specific mental algorithms or computational modules, designed to solve specific evolutionary problems of the past. Modules are also used for central processing. This theory is sometimes referred to as &quot;massive modularity&quot;. Leda Cosmides and John Tooby claimed that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. To them, each module was a complex computer that innately processed distinct parts of the world, like facial recognition, recognizing human emotions, and problem-solving. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in human evolution, when natural selection was forming the modern human species.

A 2010 review by evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. suggested that domain general theories, such as for &quot;rationality&quot;, has several problems: 1. Evolutionary theories using the idea of numerous domain-specific adaptions have produced testable predictions that have been empirically confirmed; the theory of domain-general rational thought has produced no such predictions or confirmations. 2. The rapidity of responses such as jealousy due to infidelity indicates a domain-specific dedicated module rather than a general, deliberate, rational calculation of consequences. 3. Reactions may occur instinctively (consistent with innate knowledge) even if a person has not learned such knowledge. One example being that in the ancestral environment it is unlikely that males during development learn that infidelity (usually secret) may cause paternal uncertainty (from observing the phenotypes of children born many months later and making a statistical conclusion from the phenotype dissimilarity to the cuckolded fathers). With respect to general purpose problem solvers, Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby (1992) have suggested in &quot;The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and The Generation of Culture&quot; that a purely general problem solving mechanism is impossible to build due to the frame problem. Clune et al. (2013) have argued that computer simulations of the evolution of neural nets suggest that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, connection costs are lower.

Several groups of critics, including psychologists working within evolutionary frameworks, argue that the massively modular theory of mind does little to explain adaptive psychological traits. Proponents of other models of the mind argue that the computational theory of mind is no better at explaining human behavior than a theory with mind entirely a product of the environment. Even within evolutionary psychology there is discussion about the degree of modularity, either as a few generalist modules or as many highly specific modules. Other critics suggest that there is little empirical support in favor of the domain-specific theory beyond performance on the Wason selection task, a task critics state is too limited in scope to test all relevant aspects of reasoning. Moreover, critics argue that Cosmides and Tooby&#x27;s conclusions contain several inferential errors and that the authors use untested evolutionary assumptions to eliminate rival reasoning theories.

Criticisms of the notion of modular minds from genetics include that it would take too much genetic information to form innate modularity of mind, the limits to the possible amount of functional genetic information being imposed by the number of mutations per generation that led to the prediction that only a small part of the human genome can be functional in an information-carrying way if an impossibly high rate of lethal mutations is to be avoided, and that selection against lethal mutations would have stopped and reversed any increase in the amount of functional DNA long before it reached the amount that would be required for modularity of mind. It is argued that proponents of the theory of mind conflate this with the straw man argument of assuming no function in any non-protein-coding DNA when pointing at discoveries of some parts of non-coding DNA having regulatory functions, while the actual argument of limited amount of functional DNA does acknowledge that some parts of non-coding DNA can have functions but putting bounds on the total amount of information-bearing genetic material regardless of whether or not it codes for proteins, in agreement with the discoveries of regulatory functions of non-coding DNA extending only to parts of it and not be generalized to all DNA that does not code for proteins. The maximum amount of information-carrying heredity is argued to be too small to form modular brains.

Wallace (2010) observes that the evolutionary psychologists&#x27; definition of &quot;mind&quot; has been heavily influenced by cognitivism and/or information processing definitions of the mind. Critics point out that these assumptions underlying evolutionary psychologists&#x27; hypotheses are controversial and have been contested by some psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists. For example, Jaak Panksepp, an affective neuroscientist, point to the &quot;remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development&quot; and states that &quot;the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the &quot;modularized&quot; human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained.&quot;

Philosopher David Buller agrees with the general argument that the human mind has evolved over time but disagrees with the specific claims evolutionary psychologists make. He has argued that the contention that the mind consists of thousands of modules, including sexually dimorphic jealousy and parental investment modules, are unsupported by the available empirical evidence. He has suggested that the &quot;modules&quot; result from the brain&#x27;s developmental plasticity and that they are adaptive responses to local conditions, not past evolutionary environments. However, Buller has also stated that even if massive modularity is false this does not necessarily have broad implications for evolutionary psychology. Evolution may create innate motives even without innate knowledge.

In contrast to modular mental structure, some theories posit domain-general processing, in which mental activity is distributed across the brain and cannot be decomposed, even abstractly, into independent units. A staunch defender of this view is William Uttal, who argues in &quot;The New Phrenology&quot; (2003) that there are serious philosophical, theoretical, and methodological problems with the entire enterprise of trying to localise cognitive processes in the brain. Part of this argument is that a successful taxonomy of mental processes has yet to be developed.

Merlin Donald argues that over evolutionary time the mind has gained adaptive advantage from being a general problem solver. The mind, as described by Donald, includes module-like &quot;central&quot; mechanisms, in addition to more recently evolved &quot;domain-general&quot; mechanisms.

<doc id="446610" wikidata="Q45007" url="?curid=446610" title="Chubut Province">
<text>Chubut (, ; ) is a province in southern Argentina, situated between the 42nd parallel south (the border with Río Negro Province), the 46th parallel south (bordering Santa Cruz Province), the Andes range to the west (bordering Chile), and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The province&#x27;s name derives from the Tehuelche word , meaning &quot;transparent&quot;, their description of the Chubut River.

The largest city is Comodoro Rivadavia in the south of the province; it has 180,000 inhabitants. The administrative capital is Rawson (40,000). Other important cities are Puerto Madryn, Trelew, Esquel and Sarmiento. Gaiman is a cultural and demographic centre of the region known as &quot;Y Wladfa&quot; in which Welsh-Argentines are concentrated. 

==History==
Before the Spaniards arrived in the Americas, nomadic indigenous Tehuelche people had inhabited the Patagonia region for thousands of years. They lived as hunter-gatherers and covered territory in seasonal cycles as they followed game.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish missionaries came to the area, and founded the San José Fort on Península Valdés. The indigenous people later destroyed it.

In 1865, Welsh people came to Chubut on the &quot;Mimosa&quot; and settled in the Chubut Valley. The region was disputed between Chile and Argentina until 1881. Chile renounced its claim in order to prevent Argentina from entering into the War of the Pacific, in which it was already fighting against Peru and Bolivia.

As part of the &quot;Conquista del Desierto&quot; (Conquest of the Desert), Argentina organized the National Territory of Chubut in 1884, after the last indigenous cacique, Inacayal, surrendered to government forces. Luis Fontana was named governor. At the beginning of the 20th century, after the Boer War, some Boer people settled in the town of Sarmiento and in lesser number in other nearby towns.

From 1895 to 1915 hundreds of Spanish and Italian born immigrantes settled in the lower Chubut valley as well a little more than hundred Chileans.

In 1944, the southern part of Chubut and northern part of Santa Cruz were designated the Comodoro Rivadavia Military Zone. The zone was dissolved in 1955, and Chubut was declared a province. Studies in the 1950s revealed mineral wealth in the province, which the government has tried to develop.

Population shifts of the late 20th century, especially from Buenos Aires, raised the population steadily from 190,000 (1970), to 357,000 (1991) and 413,237 (2001). The government has encouraged people to resettle here. Most of the inhabitants are in the main cities. They have also settled along the Chubut River. Most areas have a population density of less than 1 inhabitant per square kilometer.

==Economy==
Chubut&#x27;s economy, for a long time one of the most prosperous in Argentina, is one of the country&#x27;s least diversified. Nearly one-quarter of its 2006 output, estimated at US$4.652 billion (or a per capita income of US$11,256), is generated by mining and petroleum. This sector&#x27;s contribution (mostly centered around Comodoro Rivadavia) helped give Chubut the nation&#x27;s fourth-highest per capita output in 2011, US$25,250. Petroleum refining is the main economic activity of the province; it generates 13% of Argentine oil production (mostly off-shore). On May 21, 2014, Miguel Galuccio of YPF and Chubut Governor Martin Buzzi announced the first unconventional oil and gas discovery in Chubut from a fracked well in the Early Cretaceous D-129 formation of the Golfo San Jorge basin. Chubut produces 21% of the nation&#x27;s fish catch.

Sheep ranching, though less than half as productive in the 21st century compared to as recently as 1990, remains important at the local level. The advent of synthetic replacements to wool after World War II battered the sector. It declined further because of Argentina&#x27;s political instability and damage from natural disasters. Wool production has risen since 2002, however, and totaled 71,000 tons in 2006.

==Geography==

===Relief===
Chubut stretches from the Atlantic to the Andes with 3 distinct environmental regions: The Andes, the central plains and the coastal regions. The Andes in the westernmost parts of the province mostly extend along the Chilean border. The Andes are not that high in Chubut, with most peaks averaging around , which becomes smaller in altitude in the southern parts. The highest peak is Cerro Dos Picos, located east of Lago Cholila with a height of . The Andes in this province are of tertiary origin and are separated by wide, deep transverse valleys that are oriented in an east–west direction. These valleys are occupied by glacial lakes and rivers flowing east from the mountains. Most of these valleys existed before the Andes were formed. The lakes, which are mostly located in the western parts of the province are of glacial origin because during the last ice age, the movement of the glaciers lead to the formation of extensive areas of depressions that were filled up with water to form the lakes today.

===Climate===
 

The Andes cause humid winds from the Pacific Ocean to rise so most of the moisture precipitates on the western side of the Andes, leaving all except the Andean portion of the province dry. In the Andean region, the climate is cold for its latitude owing to the higher elevations there and the influence of winds from the Pacific Ocean. The peaks are usually snow covered throughout the year. In this region, precipitation ranges from to over in some areas. The central parts of the province have an arid climate with hot, sunny summers but cold winters and only average of precipitation a year. The central parts of the province are very windy throughout the year. The coast has an arid or semi-arid climate with hot, but short summers and cold winters. It is the mildest region in the province with the warmest annual mean temperatures. The coast region&#x27;s climate is a transition between the more temperate climates to the north and the colder climates in the south. Summers tend to be much warmer than Santa Cruz province to the south, particularly in the summer since subtropical air from the north and a branch of the warm Brazil Current can reach the province up until 46°. Because there is little land masses in the Southern hemisphere, most of the cold fronts, which usually move in a west to east direction are moderated as they pass over the Pacific Ocean. As such, cold temperatures are not as extreme as they are in the northern hemisphere. Similar to the rest of Patagonia the climate is characterized by strong winds throughout the year, which also leads to higher evapotranspiration, another factor in the province being mostly dry.

====Temperature====
The western parts of the province are the coldest with an annual mean temperature of owing to the higher elevations while the coastal areas are the warmest with an annual mean temperature of . The central parts of the province have an annual mean temperature of since they have a higher elevation than the coastal areas. During winter, the mean temperature in the coldest months ranges from in the northern parts of the province to in the southern parts. In the Andes, the mean temperature can be close to . Unlike the northern hemisphere, most of the cold air masses originate from the Pacific Ocean, which moderates the cold air and as such, extreme cold temperatures are rare. Occasionally, cold air masses from Antarctica are not moderated by the ocean, resulting in very cold temperatures. During summer, the temperature gradient is greater than in the winter. The northern parts of the province, have a mean temperature greater than in the warmest months while in the southern parts, the mean temperature in the warmest month ranges from owing to the influence of subtropical air from the north. The westernmost parts of the province are the coolest during the summer, averaging only . The central parts of the province have the most extreme temperatures which can reach over during the summer and below in the winter. The lowest temperature recorded in Chubut was in Sarmiento.

====Humidity and precipitation====
In general, relative humidity values do not vary a lot across the province and the contrast is not that large. In the coastal areas, the mean relative humidity is about 70% while in the rest of the province, it is around 50%–60%. The exception is in the higher altitude areas in the Andes in the colder regions where humidity levels are considerably higher. During the summer months, humidity levels are relatively low.

Because the Andes block most of the moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in, causing it to release most of the precipitation on its western slopes, most of the province is dry, averaging less than a year. In the central parts of the province, some areas receive less than of precipitation a year. In the Andean part, precipitation increases towards the Chilean border and precipitation ranges from to over . A Mediterranean like precipitation pattern, similar to central Chile with dry summers and wet winters is found in the area between the Andean region to the west and the dry steppes to the east. Although precipitation can widely vary among the province, in all locations, precipitation is higher during the winter months. Thunderstorms are rare and occur exclusively during the summer.

====Wind and sunshine====
One defining characteristic of the climate in Chubut province is the strong wind that is observed throughout the province. The wind is an additional factor that makes most of the province dry since it favors evaporation of moisture. Most of the wind comes from either the west, southwest or northwest but in coastal areas during the summer months, a sea breeze can form when westerly winds are weak, forming easterly winds that can penetrate up to from the coast. The mean wind speed is with higher wind speeds being recorded in the south where the average is more than . Higher altitude areas are more windy than lower altitude areas, resulting in the Andean region being windier than the coastal areas. As in much of Patagonia, summers tend to be windier than winters.

Sunshine in the province follows a north–south gradient (decreases from north to south), particularly during summer where northern parts of the province can receive 10 hours of sunshine/day while southern parts receive 8 hours of sunshine/day. During winter months, the province receives 4–5 hours of sunshine/day.

===Newspapers===
Print newspapers include: 
* &quot;Crónica&quot; and &quot;El Patagónico&quot; in Comodoro Rivadavia
* &quot;El Oeste&quot; in Esquel
* &quot;El Diario de Madryn&quot; in Puerto Madryn
* &quot;El Chubut&quot; and &quot;Jornada&quot; in Trelew
* &quot;Y Drafod&quot;, Welsh language newspaper since 1891

===Online journalism===
Online journalism has a small, growing presence in Chubut. The six print newspapers have online editions; these are updated every 24 hours. Some new digital proposals make a better use of web&#x27;s potential. One case is Infochubut.com, a recent publication that works with audio, video, text and photographs for its news and offers forums for public participation. Some radio stations in northwest Chubut began to publish online some of the interviews made in their radio studies.

===Radio===
The most populous cities are served by AM radio stations, such as Chubut Radio and Three Radio in Trelew, Golfo Nuevo&#x27;s Radio in Puerto Madryn, National Radio in Comodoro, Rivadavia and Esquel. There are also several FM radio stations which broadcast programs from a national central office.

===Television===
The provincial government runs a TV network that covers the province. In Trelew, Comodoro Rivadavia, Esquel, Puerto Madryn and in some small towns there are other local TV stations producing local programming to supplement the programming received from the Buenos Aires networks.

== Tourism ==
Tourism is also a growing industry. The main attractions are Peninsula Valdés and other marine wildlife reservoirs such as Punta Tombo and Punta Ninfas, with right whales, eared seals, elephant seals, penguins, orcas and many other animals. At the Punta Tombo site there is one of the largest breeding areas for the Magellanic penguin.

Further south, on the sparsely populated beaches of the Golfo San Jorge, is the only place in the world where the peculiar, flightless Chubut steamer duck can be observed. In the Andean region, the Los Alerces National Park, impressive lakes and hikes near Esquel are also visited every year by many tourists. The &#x27;Old Patagonian Express&#x27; (also known as &quot;La Trochita&quot;), the old steam train made famous by Paul Theroux, attracts many to Esquel, as does the &quot;La Hoya&quot; ski center. The petrified forest near Sarmiento is a 150 km2 park with some of the largest fossilised trees in the world.
== Transport ==
The Ruta Nacional 3 runs along the coast line up to Buenos Aires, and down to Tierra del Fuego. &quot;The Ruta Nacional 25&quot; crosses Chubut from East to West, connecting Trelew and Esquel, but half of it has not yet been paved. Regular long-distance buses run several times a day to Buenos Aires, and to many locations in the Santa Cruz Province. Short range buses to towns in Chubut run at least once a day. There are also daily summer buses on the route #25.
The Trelew airport (IATA REL) serves regular flights to/from Buenos Aires and El Calafate. Airports are also maintained at Comodoro Rivadavia (General Enrique Mosconi International Airport), Rawson and Esquel.

Major highways include:
*Route 2, from Puerto Pirámides and Península Valdés 
*Route 3, north–south via Trelew and Comodoro Rivadavia
*Route 26, west from Comodoro Rivadavia (223 km)
*Route 20, which continues north 178 km to Jose de San Martín
*Route 22, north from Perito Moreno (Santa Cruz province) 125 km
*Route 25, west from Trelew (341 km)
*Route 62, which continues west 166 km to join Route 40 at Tecka
*Route 40, traveling north 266 km via Esquel to Cabeza del Indio
*Route 30, east 73 km from Route 3 to the coast at Camarones
*Route 259, west from Esquel to Chile.

Four other roads travel west to Chile&#x27;s Aysén region, including Balmaceda and Coihaique Alto, and two to Chile&#x27;s &quot;Los Lagos&quot; region from Corcovado to Palena and from Esquel via Trevelin to Futaleufu.

== Government ==
The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court and completed by several inferior tribunals.

The Constitution of Chubut Province forms the formal law of the province.

In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Chubut Provincial Police.

==Political divisions==

The province is divided into 15 departments
(Spanish: &quot;departamentos&quot;), listed below with their Number (on map), area and populations at the Censuses of November 2000 and October 2010:

<text>Demetrios Vikelas (; ; 15 February 1835 – 20 July 1908) was a Greek businessman and writer; he was the co-founder and first president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), from 1894 to 1896.

After a childhood spent in Greece and Istanbul, he found fortune in London, where he married. He then moved to Paris, on account of his wife. Abandoning business, he dedicated himself to literature and history, and published numerous novels, short stories and essays, which earned him a distinguished reputation.

Because of his reputation and the fact that he lived in Paris, he was chosen to represent Greece in a congress called by Pierre de Coubertin in June 1894, which decided to re-establish the Olympic Games and to organise them in Athens in 1896, designating Vikelas to preside over the organisation committee. After the Games were over, he stepped down, remaining in Athens until his death in 1908.

==Childhood==
Vikelas was born in Ermoupoli, on the island of Syros in Greece. His father was a merchant, originally from Veria (then part of the Ottoman Empire, today capital of the northern Greek province of Imathia in Central Macedonia) and his mother, Smaragda, was a member of the rich Melas family. He was educated at home by his mother, possibly due to his fragile health.

When he was six, the family moved to Constantinople, and ten years after that to Odessa. There he started working for his father&#x27;s business.

Already he showed signs of his literary potential. At the age of 17 he translated &quot;Esther&quot;, a tragedy by Jean Racine.

==London, from business to literature==
While aged 17, in 1852, he left home to live in London with his uncles Leon and Vasileios Melas, where he worked for their business, Melas Bros, first as a bookkeeper and then as a partner. He also began to maintain a weekly correspondence with his mother.

This correspondence, which was kept, is one of the most important in establishing his biography. He also kept a journal in which he recorded not only facts about his daily life but also advice from his uncle Leon and his thoughts on books he had read and plays he was able to attend.

After his day&#x27;s work at his uncles&#x27; business, he took evening classes at University College London (the only university in London which did not require students to be Anglican). There, he obtained a degree in botany (the only subject which offered evening classes). He learned German and Italian. He also took part in fencing, horse-riding and rowing, although circumstances did not allow him to keep these up. He had also become very scholarly, and started to publish — an anthology of poems in 1862 and numerous articles in London periodicals, on the British press and the growing of cotton in Greece.

During the political events of 1863 in Greece, following the revolution which led to the eviction of Otto and the enthronement of George I, Vikelas led fundraising efforts in support of the provisional government. He also wrote letters to the main newspapers of the time to demand that Greece&#x27;s rights be respected. He became definitively known in the British intellectual world in 1866 when he contacted authors and academics to gain their support for the Cretan cause during the Cretan Revolt of 1866-1867, for which he raised more fundraising.

Also in 1866, he married Kalliope Geralopoulou, a young sister of Katerini, the wife of one of his uncles, also a member of a rich merchant family in London. He also became a titular partner in his uncles&#x27; business.

He also met and became friends with Charilaos Trikoupis, the son of the Greek ambassador to Britain Spyridon Trikoupis, himself destined to become Prime Minister of Greece. At the time they met, Charilaos Trikoupis was just starting his diplomatic and political career as an attaché, then &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;, of the Greek legation. The two men kept a busy correspondence.

Demetrius Vikelas continued to gain favour in Greece — in 1868 he published a 30-page statistical article on the Kingdom of Greece following a conference at the Royal Statistical Society; in 1870 he founded a school for Greek children living in England. All his work — polemic, political, journalistic, historical or literary — had a double objective: to elevate the morals and level of intellect of his country but also to change its reputation with respect to the rest of the world. In his historical essay of 1874, &quot;On the Byzantines&quot;, he wrote that he wanted to restore the reputation of the Byzantine Empire.

In 1876, in the wake of the economic crisis that had started in 1873, and in order not to lose the profits of their work, Vikelas and his uncles dissolved their business (now called &quot;Melas Bros - D. Vikelas&quot;). He thus found himself in command of a comfortable fortune, which allowed him to fully dedicate his time to literature.

==Paris, the illness of his wife, and literature==
In 1874, following the death of her father, Vikelas&#x27; wife Kalliope began to suffer from mental problems and showed a number of suicidal tendencies. The couple tried travelling to ease the illness. In Paris, following another scare, doctors declared Kalliope mad and she stayed for seven and a half months in Jules Bernard Luys&#x27; asylum in Ivry-sur-Seine. True to his character, Vikelas recorded the progress of his wife&#x27;s mental health daily during the twenty years which followed.

In his journal, from 1872 Vikelas expressed the wish to move to Athens. In 1877, while Kalliope&#x27;s condition was in remission, they took the opportunity to make the move. Vikelas started to build a home around the corner from the streets of Panepistimiou (on which the University was situated) and Voukourestiou. However, his wife&#x27;s health worsened again and he accompanied her to France where she again stayed in Ivry-sur-Seine.

During his stays in Paris, Vikelas embarked on translating Shakespeare plays into Greek: &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; during his wife&#x27;s first stay (1878), and &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; during the second (1881). The public readings of his translations received an enthusiastic welcome in the literary community in Athens. He then also wrote his main literary work: &quot;Loukis Laras&quot;. The book first appeared in Athens as a series starting in 1879. The same year, it was translated into French and German. The French translation (which had its first republication in 1880) was included by the Education Minister Jules Ferry in the list of works which could be given as prizes to good students.

Vikelas spent the following fifteen years in Paris, building up contacts with the surrounding intellectuals and literati of the French capital. Consequently, Juliette Adam dedicated her anthology &quot;Poètes grecs contemporains&quot; (&quot;Contemporary Greek poets&quot;), published in 1881, to him, and he published in her &quot;Nouvelle Revue&quot;. He wrote for it, as before, numerous articles (on Byzantine history, Eastern issues and Greek political life), novels (a compendium in French and Greek came out in 1887) and even travel guides.

In the linguistic controversy in Greece between &quot;Katharevousa&quot; and &quot;Dimotiki&quot;, Vikelas chose the middle ground, rejecting the excesses of the Dimotikists just as much as the fierce defenders of the more intellectual language. He suggested using &quot;Katharevousa&quot; for parliamentary proceedings, for example, but popular language for poetry.

Between 1877 and 1892, he travelled, since at the worst of her crises, his wife could not bear his presence. He returned to Greece, visited Scotland, Switzerland, Spain and Constantinople.

In 1892, he bought a new plot in Athens (between the streets of Kriezotou and Valaoriti) where he built a new residence which was also his final home.

In 1893, he helped finance the construction of the .

In May 1894, he received a request from the Pan-Hellenic Gymnastic Club, asking him to assist at a congress on amateurism convened the following month by Pierre de Coubertin. After hesitation, he agreed to represent the association. Following the congress it was decided to recreate the Olympic Games and to organise them in Athens.

Originally, it had been De Coubertin&#x27;s idea to hold the first celebration of the modern Olympics in Paris in 1900, but Vikelas convinced him and the newly created International Olympic Committee that they should be held in Athens, in order to symbolically link them to the original Games. As the constitution of the IOC at that time required the IOC president to be from the country which would host the next Games, Vikelas became the IOC&#x27;s first president.

==Permanent return to Greece==
With his responsibility for the 1896 Summer Olympics, Vikelas returned to Greece for just ten days in autumn 1894. On October the 14th, he received a telegram from doctor Luys informing him that the condition of his wife had worsened. She had œdemas in her thighs, calves and stomach. She could no longer feed herself. He urgently returned to Paris. It seems that she then died.

In November 1894, a number of young nationalist officers, advocates of the Megali Idea, created a secret society, Ethniki Etairia, whose aim was to revive the morale of the country and prepare the liberation of Greek peoples still under the Ottoman Empire. In September 1895, they recruited civilians, all linked to the organisation of the Olympic Games, including Vikelas himself, although he claimed only to have given in to friendly pressure, playing a solely financial role and then quickly resigning from it. At this point he was still attracted by the possibility of rebuilding his country.

After the Games, which proved a success, Vikelas withdrew from the IOC, replaced as a member by the Count Alexander Mercati and as president by Coubertin. The defeat in the Greco-Turkish War which came soon after dealt a serious blow to his morale. He decided to leave Paris to move permanently to Athens. There he dedicated himself to popular education. In 1899 he founded the &quot;Society for the Spread of Useful Books&quot; in Athens, to help the country to recover from its defeat.

In 1905, he represented the University of Athens at the third Olympic Congress and seventh IOC Meeting in Brussels. He also remained an active member of the Hellenic Olympic Committee. He died in Athens on 20 July 1908 &quot;from an afflicting illness&quot;.

He had been made a knight of the Legion of Honour on 31 December 1891, and honorary doctor of the University of St Andrews in November 1893 (the first Greek to receive this honour). He was a member (from 1874, and Vice-President from 1894) of the French &quot;Association for the Promotion of Greek Studies&quot;, and of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in London.

==Legacy==
He left his immense library collection to the city of Heraklion in Crete, founding the Vikelaia Municipal Library.

Though in fact he did not live much of his life in Syros, the island counts him among its most well-known sons. Today, the Sports Center (Stadium) in Ermoupoli bears Demetrios Vikelas&#x27; name. The stadium seats 2000 people, and has an Olympic-size swimming pool, four tennis courts, two gym halls, basket and volleyball courts, track and field, floor football court and soccer field.

Also the Syros Island National Airport is named for him.

== The Olympic Movement ==

===First Olympic Congress===

Pierre de Coubertin had already attempted to restart the Olympic Games at the Congress for the fifth anniversary of the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques in 1892. While he may have raised the enthusiasm of the public, he did not manage to establish a proper commitment.
He decided to reiterate his efforts at the Congress in 1894 which followed, which would openly address the issue of amateur sports, but also with the sub-text of the recreation of the Olympic Games. Six of the seven points which would be debated pertained to amateurism (definition, disqualification, betting, etc.) and the seventh on the possibility of restoring the Games. Coubertin also sought to give an international dimension to his congress. He gained support from several personalities: the King of the Belgians, the Prince of Wales, the Diadochus Constantine (hereditary prince of Greece) and William Penny Brookes, the founder of the &quot;Olympian Games&quot; in Shropshire, England, and Ioannis Phokianos. Phokianos was a professor of mathematics and physics and a college principal. Phokianos was also one of the propagators of sport in Greece and the organizer of an Olympic Games sponsored by Evangelis Zappas in 1875. In 1888, Phokianos organized an elite and private Games as the founder of the Pan-Hellenic Gymnastic Club. Phokianos could not travel to Paris for financial reasons and because he was finalizing the construction of his new college. He turned to one of the more eminent representatives of the Greek community in Paris, Demetrios Vikelas, to whom he wrote to ask him to take part in the Congress.

<doc id="446630" wikidata="Q5546498" url="?curid=446630" title="George Woodbridge (illustrator)">
<text>George Woodbridge (October 3, 1930 – January 20, 2004) was an American illustrator known for his exhaustive research and historical accuracy, and for his 44-year run as a contributor to &quot;MAD Magazine&quot;. He was sometimes referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s Dean of Uniform Illustration&quot; because of his expertise in drawing military uniforms.

Born in Flushing, Queens, Woodbridge studied illustration at Manhattan&#x27;s School of Visual Arts. In later years, he lived on Staten Island, where he created his detailed drawings of military uniforms, insignia and equipment.

== Military history ==
He illustrated many military history books, including the &quot;Time/Life Civil War&quot; history, George Neumann&#x27;s &quot;Collector&#x27;s Illustrated Encyclopedia of the American Revolution&quot; and Frederick P. Todd&#x27;s three-volume &quot;American Military Equipage, 1851–1872: A Description by Word and Picture of What the American Soldier, Sailor and Marine of These Years Wore and Carried&quot;. He was named a fellow of the Company of Military Historians in 1961.

Woodbridge was an early advocate for and participant in the hobby of historical reenacting, particularly that of the American Revolution which was always a special interest of his. During the American Revolution Bicentennial of 1975 - 1981, he served as commander of the association of reenactors known as the &quot;Brigade of the American Revolution&quot; which participated in many events during the period. Woodbridge also was credited as historical technical adviser to the 1986 Alan Alda film &quot;Sweet Liberty&quot;.

== &quot;Mad&quot; ==
In March 1957, Woodbridge began as a freelancer to &quot;Mad&quot; when Al Feldstein was the editor. Feldstein observed, &quot;George&#x27;s strong points were many. He was especially adept at delineating amusing street scenes with crowds and signs and outlandish going-ons, as well as depicting humorous interpretations of just plain people in comedic human situations. The articles he was assigned to illustrate were chosen with those superb talents in mind.&quot; Woodbridge remained with &quot;Mad&quot; for five decades. Later &quot;Mad&quot; editor John Ficarra noted, &quot;He had a tremendous eye for detail that showed up in his drawings. We especially played to his history knowledge. When we gave him a piece on World War I, he would draw the exact gun and belt buckle they were using then.&quot;

Woodbridge illustrated several &quot;Mad&quot; books, such as Dick DeBartolo&#x27;s &quot;A Mad Guide to Leisure Time&quot; and &quot;Mad&#x27;s Cradle to Grave Primer&quot; (Warner Books, 1973), written by Larry Siegel and edited by Nick Meglin. When Bhob Stewart edited the &quot;Mad Style Guide&quot; in 1994, he gave Woodbridge the assignment of drawing the &quot;Mad&quot; Zeppelin from three different angles as a detailed guide for any company that might one day market a miniature model of the airship.

Woodbridge was color blind, yet he worked in color, as noted by cartoonist Sergio Aragonés, &quot;He was such a good friend. He knew everything about history and he knew everything about artwork. When I was starting out and they gave me assignments that had to be in color, George was the one who helped me. Even though he was color blind, he did the most remarkable work in color. He was a wonderful man, and I will miss him very much.&quot;

Woodbridge told Mark Evanier (&quot;Mad Art&quot;): &quot;I regard myself as an illustrator of historical subjects. When I&#x27;m not working for &quot;Mad&quot;, that&#x27;s the field in which I work, though I&#x27;m damned proud to be part of &quot;Mad&quot;. I don&#x27;t consider one field superior to the other and, in fact, the challenges are altogether different. In historical illustration, the goal is to be accurate. In &quot;Mad&quot;, the goal is to be funny.&quot; This included Woodbridge&#x27;s brief stint as the artist for &quot;Spy vs. Spy,&quot; the long-running &quot;Mad&quot; feature originally created and drawn by Cuban artist Antonio Prohias. Woodbridge illustrated just two installments, signing them as &quot;Jorge Puente de Madera.&quot;

Woodbridge admitted, however, that his least-favorite subject was sports. This was Jack Davis&#x27; specialty; but during the time Davis wasn&#x27;t available, that work went to Woodbridge and he struggled. &quot;That subject seemed to come so naturally to Jack,&quot; Woodbridge said. &quot;But I really had to sweat those jobs.&quot; However, Woodbridge&#x27;s most famous article for &quot;Mad&quot; was about sports, albeit a stupid, fictitious one. [See below.]

==43-Man Squamish==
For &quot;Mad&quot; No. 95 (June 1965), he drew the sports satire &quot;43-Man Squamish&quot;, prompting Ficarra to comment, &quot;It&#x27;s arguably our most requested piece to reprint. It struck a chord. Colleges all over formed teams and played this crazy game, with these ridiculous-looking helmets. George captured that lunacy.&quot; Written by Tom Koch, the absurdist article detailed the convoluted rules of an imaginary sport, and made enough of an impression to be mentioned in both men&#x27;s New York Times obituaries, including the first sentence of Koch&#x27;s.

In the article, new terminology is introduced with no explanation; much of the humor derives from the reader&#x27;s half-successful attempts at gleaning a meaning from context. Exactly what everyone on the team is supposed to do, exactly what penalties apply, and exactly when or why the &quot;yellow caution flag&quot; is to be flown remains far from clear, even after repeated readings.

Although writer Koch intended the game to be completely unplayable, some colleges even attempted to form teams and play the game. The letters column to MAD #97 included several &quot;team photos&quot; and accounts from new acolytes of the sport. A student from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute issued a public challenge to Harvard, while athletes from the University of Alberta exulted that &quot;we happen to be the only undefeated Squamish team in Western Canada, mainly because we are the only team in Western Canada, and we haven&#x27;t played a game. We can&#x27;t understand why we have no opposition.&quot; A letter from the Athletic Committee of Marquette University reported that three of its Squamish players had been suspended for &quot;sportsmanlike conduct.&quot;

==Death==

Woodbridge died of emphysema at age 73, on January 20, 2004, in a Staten Island hospital. He was survived by his second wife, Deborah, and by his first wife Ines and their sons, George, Curtis (also a professional illustrator), and Christopher Woodbridge.

<text>Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy (GTP) is a method of psychotherapy based strictly on Gestalt psychology. Its origins go back to the 1920s when Gestalt psychology founder Max Wertheimer, Kurt Lewin and their colleagues and students started to apply the holistic and systems theoretical Gestalt psychology concepts in the field of psychopathology and clinical psychology. Through holism, &quot;a person&#x27;s thinking, feeling, actions, perceptions, attitudes and logical operations&quot; are seen as one unity. Many developments in psychotherapy in the following decades drew from these early beginnings, like e.g. group psychoanalysis (S. Foulkes), Gestalt therapy (Laura Perls, Fritz Perls, Goodman, and others), or Katathym-imaginative Psychotherapy (Hanscarl Leuner).

== History ==
In Europe Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy in its own right has been initiated and formulated on this basis by the German Gestalt psychologists and psychotherapists Hans-Jürgen P. Walter, Rainer Kästl and their colleagues in Germany and Austria. Walter, a student of Gestalt psychologist Friedrich Hoeth, was influenced to form the core of his theoretical concept on the basis of the work of Gestalt theorists Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang Köhler, Kurt Koffka, Kurt Lewin, and Wolfgang Metzger. Walter&#x27;s first publication on Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy came out in 1977 &quot;Gestalttheorie und Psychotherapie&quot; (Gestalt Theory and Psychotherapy), which is now on its third edition (1994). The majority of the extensive literature on Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy which has been published in the decades since then is in the German language. However, in 2021, the international multidisciplinary journal &quot;Gestalt Theory&quot; published an issue focusing on Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy, offering a series of articles in English on the essentials of this method, and in 2022 Gerhard Stemberger - in the last decades the most prolific author of this method - published the anthology &quot;Essentials of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy&quot;, which contains this series in a revised and expanded form and supplemented by additional contributions. In 2024 Stemberger published the anthology &quot;Grundkonzepte der Gestalttheoretischen Psychotherapie&quot; (Basic Concepts of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy), a comprehensive presentation of the practice and theory of this Gestalt psychological approach to psychotherapy, with contributions from authors from Austria, Germany and Italy.

Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy in this form has gained popularity predominately in German speaking countries. It is officially approved by the Austrian government as a scientific psychotherapy method under the Austrian Psychotherapy Act.

== Gestalt psychology ==
GTP bases its theoretical presumptions not only on &quot;partial theses&quot; and &quot;partial findings&quot; of Gestalt psychology, but also on the &quot;overall system&quot; of Gestalt Theory of the Berlin School featuring Wertheimer, Kohler, Koffka, Lewin, and others. Wolfgang Metzger and Paul Tholey identify five sub-approaches of the Gestalt Theory, which, relating to each other, form up an organized system. Gestalt Psychology can be presented as a:

# Methodology offering a &quot;holistic view and experimental orientation.”
# Phenomenology providing &quot;a wealth of research-backed knowledge about Gestalt phenomena in perception and cognition, behaviour and life processes, including social relations.&quot; 
# Theory of dynamic processes &quot;from productive thought to the psychology of will and social life.&quot;
# Psychophysical approach &quot;including the working hypothesis of isomorphism.&quot;
# Epistemological approach of &quot;critical realism.”

== Description ==
One of the most striking characteristics of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy is the key role of the epistemological grounding position of Gestalt theory (critical realism) and its applicability to the fundamental, theoretical, and practical problems in psychotherapy. In Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy this is closely bound up with the basic methodological approach (holistic, phenomenological, experimental) of Gestalt theory, its system theoretical approach, and its specific psychophysical and psychological approach.

Gerhard Stemberger&#x27;s &quot;Diagnostics in Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy&quot;, provides insight into the concept and process of Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy. The Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy therapeutic process is a relationship between two individuals in which both the therapist and client develop an egalitarian attitude. An egalitarian attitude is the concept that everyone is equal. The diagnostic process and the therapeutic process are inseparable to Gestalt theoretical psychotherapists. The therapist should act as a “fellow voyager” of the client, supporting them in discovering their specific and personal feelings and problems. Gestalt theoretical psychotherapists believe that an individual cannot be forced into doing things against the individual&#x27;s nature; therefore, the therapist must adapt diagnostic exploration to the individual&#x27;s capabilities.

In GTP, the client investigates their experience through logical reasoning and their senses. Stemberger points out that whatever one discovers relates to “not only to what is descriptively encountered in the experience, such as what is seen, heard, felt, and sensed, but also to what is thought, imagined, remembered, and planned.” Referring to Kurt Lewin, a change can only arise if the therapist raises full awareness to the “dynamic properties” of the client&#x27;s current psychological situation. Consequently, it is vital in GTP that the client faces their fears “here and now,” processing their experience with proper support and intervention.

The therapeutic process requires no strict or set schedule, and the speed of the process varies for each individual. “Force-field analysis,” a concept from Lewin, is a phenomenological procedure in which the therapist and client look for opportunities to explore specific attributes of the client&#x27;s life space, their driving forces, and barriers. This can occur in therapy through dialogue, allowing the client to experience their feelings through speaking. The anthropological model in Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy is the belief that the therapist should not only focus on ‘inner components’ of the client, but also focus on the interaction between the client and their environment that effect their experience and behavior. The client directs his overall attention to the presence, listening inside themselves, remaining conscious, following whatever appears in the current state. Only then can the therapist focus their questions and involvement on the client&#x27;s analyses of the situation.

=== Critical Realism ===
Critical Realism assumes a distinction between the physical and phenomenal world. First developed by Köhler, Koffka and Metzger, it was improved by Norbert Bischof and Paul Tholey. Gestalt theory takes, from an ontological perspective, a “monistic position” on a mental and physical problem, supporting the holistic theory. From a metaphysical perspective, it takes a “dualistic position” distinguishing between the “trans-phenomenal world” and the “phenomenal world.” The divergence between physical facts and perception was proved by Wertheimer, who investigated the relationship between the organization of the geographical and phenomenal fields.

=== The trans-phenomenal world ===
The trans-phenomenal world considers “the macrocosm of the physical world and all physical objects and physical organisms embedded therein.” It is trans-phenomenal as people cannot directly access it – it is theorized or constructed. Whatever one hypothesizes, says, or establishes about the trans-phenomenal world comes from interpreting data acquired using phenomenal methods, theoretical forms and models. The data obtained constitutes the “critical-phenomenal view,” through which each individual has their own “microcosmic phenomenal world” seen by them as reality.

=== The phenomenal world ===
The phenomenal world is the “internal perceptual world of conscious experience,” i.e., a copy of the external world of objective reality constructed in the brain based on the depiction derived from the retina. Illustratively, the phenomenal world individuals face is not an actual world but a copy of the external world generated by the brain. As discussed by Tholey, physical stimuli reach our physical senses and enter our brains through neural pathways into the cerebral cortex. Köhler used the term &quot;psychophysical level,&quot; at which the stimuli transform, resulting in a psychological experience.

=== Isomorphism ===
Köhler, recognizing the contributions of Wertheimer and Koffka, designed the “isomorphism assumption,” suggesting a uniformity between physical and physiological operations and psychological processes. Isomorphism indicates that for every experienced phenomenon, there is a corresponding set of brain processes. The assumption portrays why individuals can move in the perceived environment and interact with it, including other individuals with regards to their needs.

=== Force-field theory ===
Critical realism suggests that phenomenal worlds of individuals vary and different experiences arise. Lewin developed the &quot;force-field theory,&quot; in which these phenomenal worlds are “field events.” Notably, an individual&#x27;s behaviour relies on “field forces between the person and the environment.” Through this interaction, the world&#x27;s objects can have positive or negative characters on a person, caused by various “attracting or repulsive forces.” The attracting forces attract an individual to an object while opposing forces repulse from it. The force-field theory is crucial in GTP as it underpins the understanding of variations across perceptions of situations, providing the foundation for interpreting situations and interactions.

== Critical Realism in psychotherapeutic relationships ==
Referring to critical realism, Stemberger describes two situations in a psychotherapeutic relationship. First of all, there is a connection or experience arising in a psychotherapist&#x27;s phenomenal world. Secondly, there is the client&#x27;s perception of the therapeutic relation or situation. There is space for a mutual exchange between both sides through the egalitarian attitude about their shared experience. Both parties can experience psychotherapy differently; thus, critical realism enables the psychotherapist to look at their encounter and assess the therapeutic relationship and situation critically, contributing to an open, straightforward conversation and collective coordination. This protects the client from the therapists&#x27; potential dominance and the therapist from being influenced by illusions of control and power.

== The empty-chair technique ==
GTP proposes “experience-centred interventions”, such as the empty chair technique, through which the client faces direct contact with their direct experience. The client imagines someone with whom they have experienced conflict sitting on the chair. The person then speaks to the chair, sharing their emotions and feelings. After that, the client takes the role of the person sitting, responding to the words they said previously. Consequently, the person empathizes with the other side by coming across their feelings. This enables clients to process their struggles by approaching their situation from a broader perspective. 

The empty-chair technique and some other &quot;experience-centred interventions&quot; were adopted from Gestalt therapy.

The technique does not imply that the client&#x27;s direct experience is not affected by ideas or concepts. Stemberger discusses: &quot;all own explanations for the relationship in the world belong to the critical-phenomenal world, ... all beliefs, convictions and ideologies, including all related problems, doubts and pricks of consciences.&quot; For that reason, GTP should evaluate the extent to which beliefs and theories may affect the client&#x27;s perception, a judgement of the experience, and behaviour. That being the case, the therapist can diagnose the patient with minimized bias.

== Criticism ==
The Gestalt Therapy developed by Fritz Perls received criticizing views from many academic Gestalt psychology representatives, mainly from Mary Henle. Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy is related to but different from Fritz Perls&#x27; Gestalt therapy in its theoretical foundation. Mary Henle has pointed out the differences between Gestalt theory in its original sense and the Perls&#x27;ian understanding of Gestalt. With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls&#x27; books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls&#x27; earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method. It must also be mentioned that Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy adopts techniques from Gestalt therapy as well as from other psychotherapy methods as Walter points out. This corresponds to the conviction in Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy that techniques and working methods from other therapy methods can be integrated into Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy as long as they are compatible with the Gestalt psychological approach and are interpreted and handled according to the basic Gestalt psychological concepts.

<text>The Saab 2000 is a twin-engined high-speed turboprop airliner built by Swedish aircraft manufacturer Saab. It is designed to carry 50–58 passengers and able to cruise at a maximum speed of . Production took place in Linköping, Sweden. It first flew in March 1992 and was certified in 1994. The last aircraft was delivered in April 1999, a total of 63 aircraft were built. As of October 2024, a total of 31 Saab 2000s are either in airline or military service.

==Development and design==
In the 1980s, Saab decided to build a fuselage-stretched derivative of its successful Saab 340 twin-turboprop regional airliner. The new aircraft was planned to meet a perceived demand for a high-speed 50-seat turboprop with good climb performance which could operate over short- and medium-range routes with similar block times to jet aircraft while retaining the efficiency provided by turboprop engines. The new airliner, named the Saab 2000, was formally launched in May 1989, with Saab already having firm orders for 46 aircraft and options for a further 147. The aircraft was assembled at Saab&#x27;s Linköping factory, with major subcontractors including CASA, who built the aircraft&#x27;s wings, Short Brothers, who built the rear fuselage and Valmet who built the aircraft&#x27;s tail surfaces. The Saab 2000 first flew on 26 March 1992 and entered into scheduled airline service in September 1994, a few months after its certification by the Joint Aviation Authorities in March and the Federal Aviation Administration in April.

The Saab 2000 has a 15% greater wingspan than the Saab 340, and being longer can carry up to 58 passengers (while for European Union, the certified Maximum Passenger Seating Capacities is 53 according to the Type-certificate Data Sheet issued by EASA.) in a high-density layout and 50 with a more comfortable seat pitch. The 2000 was the first commercial aircraft to use the Allison GMA 2100 turboprop engines, which are derated to for the plane. One engine was mounted on each wing, as in the 340, with the engines placed further from the fuselage than those of the 340 to reduce cabin noise. The Dowty-Rotol propellers are in diameter, and they have a slow rotational speed of 1,100 rpm at takeoff and 950 rpm in cruise. The aircraft was designed to operate at a maximum cruise speed of Mach 0.62.

==Operational history==
Sales of the Saab 2000 were fairly limited. The major initial customer was Crossair, a regional airline at which Swissair was the majority shareholder of it since 1993. Crossair dubbed the aircraft &quot;Concordino&quot;. The airline took delivery of 34 aircraft since year 1994 and retired the type in year 2005.

Crossair also took the delivery of the last example of newly manufactured Saab 2000 on 29 April 1999. The reason for Saab to cease the production of this aircraft type is due to limited demand, and the low sales during the production period was due to the success of regional jets such as the Bombardier CRJ and Embraer ERJ 145 family which provided better passenger comfort combined with better profitability.

France-based carrier Regional Airlines of Nantes took delivery of its first Saab 2000 turboprop in Paris in year 1995, which was scheduled to serve between Lyon and Madrid. In year 1996, the carrier accepted its fifth Saab 2000 into service, and the aircraft was assigned for the Marseille to Amsterdam route in August 1996.

The government of Marshall Islands committed to purchase two Saab 2000s (with an option to purchase two more), and the first delivery was taken by Air Marshall Islands to serve Micronesia Island region of the Pacific Ocean between year 1995-1998; after that the plane was leased to Air Vanuatu serving between Fiji and Vanuatu, 
while the lease was terminated in March 1999, and after that such Saab 2000 aircraft was sold to a Europe-based air carrier.

General Motors operated several 36-seat versions of Saab 2000 for corporate shuttle operations out of its Detroit headquarters between 1995 and 2007 and during that period was in talks with startup air carrier Pro Air to launch a regional airline unit to feed flights into Detroit City Airport. GM would offer a free lease on three Saab 2000s in exchange for free flights for its employees and a share in the revenues made on routes eventually chosen by Pro Air. However, the FAA grounded Pro Air on 18 September 2000
 before consummation of the deal, and on 28 September 2000 NTSB rejected Pro Air&#x27;s bid to return to the skies. One of the Saab 2000 aircraft previously operated by GM was delivered to the flight department of Penske Corporation in April 2008, and the aircraft was used to support the group’s NASCAR auto racing team. 

In the United Kingdom, Saab 2000 aircraft was recognized as a low-ownership-cost aircraft at least in the 2010s. In 2014, Loganair introduced the Saab 2000 aircraft for its services between Shetland and the Scottish mainland. Eastern Airways introduced the Saab 2000 aircraft as early as 2004, and in 2008, the airline was flying six Saab 2000s to serve domestic flights within United Kingdom and to serve the energy-industry business in southern North Sea; the airline&#x27;s Saab 2000 fleet was further enlarged to nine in 2014, at which the new addition was assigned to serve charter operations for the oil and gas industry while the aircraft type itself served also the scheduled network of Eastern Airways and the ad-hoc charters to European destinations.

Estonian airline NyxAir acquired two ex-Loganair Saab 2000 aircraft in August 2020 to work with Air Leap in Sweden and serving two destinations: Malmö and Ängelholm-Helsingborg, each of them both connected with Stockholm Bromma Airport respectively. Starting in May 2021, NyxAir&#x27;s 50-seat Saab 2000 aircraft were once assigned to Finland to operate the Kemi-Kokkola-Helsinki and Jyväskylä-Helsinki routes. NyxAir operated four examples of Saab 2000 aircraft as of 7 May 2021.

Saab 2000 aircraft was deployed for the seasonal service of 2023 between Gothenburg and Lyon in Europe. The 50-seat Saab 2000 aircraft also served between Finnish capital Helsinki and the Estonian resort town Pärnu in summer seasonal service of year 2023.

Transition of registry of four ex-NyxAir Saab 2000 aircraft to a Danish AOC registry, obtained by Frost Air at which its aircraft are home-based in Malmö, occurred in July 2024.

For the first converted freighter Saab 2000(F), NyxAir facilitated a 59-minute post-maintenance test flight in 6 March 2023 at Örebro for the Saab 2000(F) registered as ES-NSJ under NyxAir’s AOC authority. In February 2024, it was reported that the breed system of Saab 2000(F) has to be redesigned.

For scheduled passenger service in the United States, PenAir took the delivery of its first Saab 2000 in 2015, for an upgrade of the passenger air service to Unalaska with larger aircraft. Some subsequent addition of Saab 2000s to PenAir in year 2016 were examples previously serving the NASCAR teams. According to a press citing the airline founder Orin Seybert’s saying, Saab 2000 is considered as a plane designed for trips to Unalaska that the turboprop can reach 30,000 feet, travel 400 mph and still land on a 4,000-foot runway. This is the first time for a US air carrier to use Saab 2000 aircraft for Part 121 scheduled passenger operations.

Sterling Airways in the United States forms a joint venture Alaska Seaplanes to operate Saab 2000 under the brand Aleutian Airways. In 2022, Aleutian Airways has been granted approval to start charter and scheduled air service to Unalaska upon completion of a test-flight using Saab 2000 aircraft, and after that charter service commences in September 2022 and the Aleutian Airways&#x27; first scheduled flight serving Unalaska commences in 16 November 2022. Extension on Saab 2000&#x27;s service coverage to Sand Point, Cold Bay and, together with a seasonal scheduled service to King Salmon, commences in 2023.

Air Charter Express, the passenger division of Freight Runners Express headquartered in Milwaukee WI, took delivery the first example of SAAB 2000 in October 2021. Further example acquired in November 2022 is an ex-Eastern Airways&#x27; Saab 2000 aircraft previously served in the United Kingdom.

For military use, Pakistan completed, in June 2006, the purchase of six Saab 2000 turboprop aircraft equipped with the Saab-Ericsson ERIEYE Airborne Early Warning system while revised in May 2007 due to renegotiation with the Government of Pakistan that only five aircraft would be delivered and four of which to be equipped with the Erieye system. On 3 April 2008, the first Saab 2000 Erieye AEW&amp;C was rolled out and presented to Pakistan Air Force officials during a ceremony in Sweden. Subsequent additional orders have been placed in 2017 and 2020, which further expanded Pakistan’s Erieye fleet; and as at August 2024, Pakistan Air Force has nine Saab 2000 Erieye AEW&amp;C Aircraft.

==Accidents and incidents==
As of February 2024, there was 4 hull-loss accidents involving Saab 2000 series aircraft, and among those accidents one of them involving 1 fatality.

===Accidents with fatalities===
* On 17 October 2019, PenAir Flight 3296 suffered a runway overrun while landing at Unalaska Airport in Alaska with 42 occupants on board; 1 person died and 9 were injured. The probable cause was the incorrect wiring of the wheel speed transducer harnesses on the left main landing gear during overhaul, causing the antiskid system to malfunction. Contributing factors were Saab&#x27;s failing to consider and protect against human error during maintenance, in its design of the harness; the FAA&#x27;s lack of consideration of the RSA size, allowing the Saab 2000 to operate at the airport; and the flight crew&#x27;s willingness to land with a tailwind exceeding the airplane&#x27;s limit due to their plan continuation bias, aggravated by PenAir&#x27;s failure to apply its qualification policy which allowed the pilot to operate at a challenging airport with limited experience at the airport and in the craft.

===Hull losses===
* On 8 October 1999, a Saab 2000 aircraft registered as SE-LSF and named &quot;Eir Viking&quot;, was being taxied by two technicians while then crashed into closed hangar doors at Arlanda airport in Sweden. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* On 10 July 2002, Swiss International Air Lines Flight 850, registered as HB-IZY, was forced to make an emergency landing at Werneuchen Airfield, Germany, as a result of severe weather. One of the sixteen passengers on board suffered minor injuries. The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair when it hit an earth bank placed across the runway, where the runway markings did not conform to standards.

===Other incidents===

*On 15 December 2014, Loganair Flight 6780 was struck by lightning while approaching Sumburgh Airport. When the commander made nose-up pitch inputs the aircraft did not respond as he expected. After reaching 4,000 ft the aircraft pitched to a minimum of 19° nose down and exceeded the applicable maximum operating speed by 80 kt, with a peak descent rate of 9,500 ft/min. The flight subsequently suffered from control difficulties and nosedived from 4000 feet to 1000 feet after the crew tried taking over the controls, but failed to notice that the autopilot was still engaged. The pilots then declared a mayday and returned to Aberdeen Airport. There were 33 occupants onboard and no injuries were reported. The subsequent investigation discovered that the planes&#x27; autopilot could not be overridden by pilot input, making it unique among all other aircraft in service. AAIB reported safety actions to be taken regarding the autopilot operation; putting &quot;Notice to Aircrew (NOTAC 123/14)&quot; in place; and revision to Autopilot Standard Operating Procedures. This incident is featured in the first episode, titled &quot;North Sea Nightmare&quot;, of Season 21 of &quot;Mayday&quot;.

<doc id="446642" wikidata="Q714179" url="?curid=446642" title="Snickers">
<text>Snickers (stylized in all caps) is a chocolate bar consisting of nougat topped with caramel and peanuts, all encased in milk chocolate. The bars are made by the American company Mars Inc. The annual global sales of Snickers is over $380 million, and it is widely considered the bestselling candy bar in the world.

Snickers was introduced by Mars in 1930 and named after the Mars family&#x27;s favorite horse. Initially marketed as &quot;Marathon&quot; in the UK and Ireland, its name was changed to Snickers in 1990 to align with the global brand, differentiating it from an unrelated US product also named Marathon. Snickers has expanded its product line to include variations such as mini, dark chocolate, white chocolate, ice cream bars, and several nut, flavor, and protein-enhanced versions. Ingredients have evolved from its original formulation to adapt to changing consumer preferences and nutritional guidelines. Despite fluctuations in bar size and controversies around health and advertising, Snickers remains a prominent snack worldwide, sponsoring significant sporting events and introducing notable marketing campaigns.

==History==
In 1930, Mars introduced Snickers, named after the favorite horse of the Mars family. The Snickers chocolate bar consists of nougat, peanuts, and caramel with a chocolate coating. The bar was marketed under the name &quot;Marathon&quot; in the UK and Ireland until 1990, when Mars decided to align the UK product with the global Snickers name (Mars had marketed and discontinued an unrelated bar named Marathon in the United States during the 1970s which was similar to the UK&#x27;s Curly Wurly). A Marathon retro edition was sold exclusively at the UK Morrisons supermarket for three months in 2019.

There are other Snickers products such as Snickers mini (invented by Carlos Calle), dark chocolate, white chocolate, ice cream bars, Snickers with almonds, Snickers with hazelnuts, Snickers with pecans, Snickers peanut butter bars, Snickers protein and Snickers with Extra Caramel, as well as espresso, fiery, and sweet &amp; salty versions.

In 2024, Mars and Jel Sert collaborated to market Snickers-flavored pudding and pie mix.

== Ingredients ==
A circa 1939 ingredient list for the original bar included white sugar, sweet milk chocolate, corn syrup, peanuts, milk condensed with sugar, coconut oil, malted milk, egg whites and salt. By 2019, the ingredients for the original bar had been changed to: milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milkfat, soy lecithin), peanuts, corn syrup, sugar, palm oil, skim milk, lactose, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.

==Caloric value==
The USDA lists the caloric value of a 2-ounce (57 gram) Snickers bar as . As of 2018, the United Kingdom bar has a weight of , with 245 kcal, and the Canadian bar with 250 kcal.

==Bar weight==
Over the years, the bar weight has decreased: Before 2009, in the UK a single Snickers bar had a weight of . This weight was subsequently reduced to in 2009, and to in 2013. In the United States the listed weight in 2018 was 52.7 g. In Australia, Snickers bars were originally made locally and weighed , however in the late 2010s production moved to China and the bars were shrunk to . In 2022, production returned to Australia and bars further reduced in weight to .

==Products containing Snickers==
Containing approximately per bar, deep fried chocolate bars (including Snickers and Mars bars) became a specialty in fish and chips shops in Scotland in 1995, and in the early 2000s, became popular at American state fairs.

In 2006, the British Food Commission highlighted celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Snickers pie&quot;, which contained five Snickers bars among other ingredients, suggesting it was one of the unhealthiest desserts ever; one slice providing &quot;over from sugar and fat alone&quot;, more than half a day&#x27;s requirement for an average adult. The pie had featured on his BBC Saturday programme some two years earlier and the chef described it as an occasional treat only.

==Advertising==

===&quot;It&#x27;s so satisfying&quot;===
In 1980, Snickers (and Marathon) ran ads which featured a variety of everyday people discussing why they like Snickers. The ads featured a jingle that said &quot;It&#x27;s so satisfying&quot; and depicted a hand that would open and close showing a handful of peanuts converting to a Snickers bar. &quot;Packed with peanuts, Snickers really satisfies&quot; was shown in the commercials.

===1984 Olympics===
Mars paid $5 million to have Snickers and M&amp;M&#x27;s named the &quot;official snack&quot; of the 1984 Summer Olympics, outraging nutritionists. Sports promotions in international games continued to be a prominent marketing tool for Mars, keeping Snickers as an international brand while also selling local bars in some markets.

===Not Going Anywhere For a While?===
Beginning in 1995, Snickers ran ads which featured someone making a self-inflicted mistake, with the voice-over saying &quot;Not going anywhere for a while? Grab a Snickers!&quot; The tag line at the end of each ad proclaimed, &quot;Hungry? Why Wait?&quot; Later ads have used the tagline “Rookie mistake? Maybe you just need a Snickers.”

Some of the ads were done in conjunction with the National Football League, with whom Snickers had a sponsorship deal at the time. One ad featured a member of the grounds crew at Arrowhead Stadium painting the field for an upcoming Kansas City Chiefs game in hot, late-summer weather. After finishing one of the end zones, and visibly exhausted, one of the Chiefs players walks up to him and says the field looks great, &quot;but who are the Chefs?&quot;, showing that despite all the hard work the painter accidentally omitted the &quot;i&quot; in Chiefs. Another had Marv Levy in the Buffalo Bills locker room lecturing his team that &quot;no one&#x27;s going anywhere&quot; until the Bills figure out how to actually win a Super Bowl.

===Snickers Feast===
In 2007, Snickers launched a campaign which featured Henry VIII and a Viking among others who attend the &quot;Snickers Feast&quot;. It consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.

===Super Bowl XLI commercial===
On February 4, 2007, during Super Bowl XLI, Snickers commercials aired. This resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, Masterfoods USA of Hackettstown, New Jersey, a division of Mars, Incorporated. The commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally kissing while sharing a Snickers bar. After quickly pulling away, one mechanic sheepishly says, &quot;I think we just accidentally kissed.&quot;, and another mechanic frantically exclaims, &quot;Quick! Do something manly!&quot; and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large pipe wrench, and drinking motor oil and windshield washer fluid. In the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks &quot;Is there room for three in this Love Boat?&quot;

Complaints were lodged against Masterfoods that the ads were homophobic. Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese is quoted as saying, &quot;This type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian school children on playgrounds all across the country.&quot;

Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) president Neil Giuliano said &quot;That Snickers, Mars and the NFL would promote and endorse this kind of prejudice is simply inexcusable.&quot; Masterfoods has since pulled the ads and the website.

===Mr. T===
In 2006, Mr. T starred in a Snickers advertisement in the UK where he rides up in an army tank and shouts abuse at a football player who appears to be faking an injury, threatening to introduce him to his friend Pain. Another advertisement featured Mr. T launching bars at a swimmer who appeared to refuse to get in a swimming pool because of the cold temperature of the water. In 2008, a European Snickers commercial in which Mr. T uses a Jeep-mounted Minigun to fire Snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a &quot;disgrace to the man race&quot; was pulled after complaints from a US pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic. These advertisements usually ended with Mr. T saying &quot;Snickers: Get Some Nuts!&quot;

===NASCAR===
In NASCAR racing, Snickers (and the rest of the Mars affiliated brands) sponsored Kyle Busch&#x27;s No. 18 Toyota for Joe Gibbs Racing. Prior to that the brand served as a primary sponsor for Ricky Rudd&#x27;s No. 88 Robert Yates Racing Ford as well as an associate sponsor for the team&#x27;s No. 38 car driven first by Elliott Sadler and then by David Gilliland, and an associate sponsor for the MB2 Motorsports No. 36 Pontiac driven by Derrike Cope, Ernie Irvan, Ken Schrader, and others. In 1990, Bobby Hillin drove for Stavola Brothers Racing in the No. 8 Snickers Buick, marking the candy&#x27;s first appearance as a sponsor; it had since been driven by Rick Wilson and Dick Trickle. Mars announced that at the conclusion of the 2022 NASCAR Cup Series season, they would pull their sponsorship from not only Joe Gibbs Racing, but NASCAR entirely and it was replaced by Monster Energy.

===FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro sponsorship===
Snickers was the Official Sponsor of the FIFA World Cup from 1994 until 1998 editions and the UEFA European Championship 1996. Snickers was also the main sponsor of the Champions League in 1992–93 and 1993–94, Asian Cup 2011 and African Cup of Nations 2019.

===You&#x27;re Not You When You&#x27;re Hungry===
In 2010, a new advertising campaign was launched, usually based around people turning into different people (usually celebrities) as a result of hunger (taking the new campaign&#x27;s name &quot;You&#x27;re Not You When You&#x27;re Hungry&quot; quite literally). The tagline varied depending on the commercial&#x27;s location or what variety the commercial is showing. The American adverts initially ended with the tagline &quot;Snickers Satisfies&quot;. Steve Burns, best known as the first host of the children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue&#x27;s Clues&quot; has done the voice of the announcer. BBDO New York said this campaign made Snickers the number one candy bar, up from seventh. In 2020, &quot;USA Today&quot;&#x27;s Ad Meter named it the best Super Bowl campaign of the past 25 years.

In 2010, Betty White and Abe Vigoda appeared in the first Snickers commercial in this campaign, playing American football. The commercial was ranked by ADBOWL as the best advertisement of the year. This commercial was also briefly spoofed in an episode of &quot;SportsNation&quot; on ESPN2 with Michelle Beadle playing the role instead of Betty White in 2011. Later that year, Snickers commercials featured singers Aretha Franklin and Liza Minnelli, and comedians Richard Lewis and Roseanne Barr. A 2011 commercial featured actors Joe Pesci and Don Rickles.

In Latin America, the slogan was the same as in the UK version, except that men doing extreme sports turning into the Mexican singer Anahí as a result of hunger. Brazilian versions of the ad featured actresses Betty Faria and Cláudia Raia.

In 2013, Robin Williams and Bobcat Goldthwait appeared in a Snickers football commercial. Russian duo t.A.T.u. appeared in a Japanese Snickers commercial as themselves throwing a tantrum in a baseball game before eating the chocolate reverts them into normal baseball players. In March 2014, a commercial featuring Godzilla was released to promote the 2014 Godzilla film. In the commercial, Godzilla is shown hanging out with humans on the beach, riding dirt bikes, and water skiing; he only begins rampaging once he is hungry. After being fed a Snickers bar, he resumes having fun with the humans.

In February 2015, Snickers&#x27; Super Bowl XLIX commercial featured a parody of a scene from an episode of &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; entitled &quot;The Subject Was Noses.&quot; In the commercial, Carol and Mike try to calm down a very angry Machete (played by Danny Trejo). When the parents give Machete a Snickers bar, he reverts into Marcia before an irate Jan (played by Steve Buscemi) rants upstairs and walks away. In a second commercial set earlier, Marcia (as Machete) angrily brushes her hair while yelling through her door.

In 2016, for Super Bowl 50, another Snickers commercial was made, featuring Willem Dafoe (as Marilyn Monroe) and Eugene Levy, where Willem Dafoe complains about filming the iconic &quot;subway grate&quot; scene in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot;. After being given a Snickers, he turns into Marilyn and goes ahead with the scene, with Levy operating the fan below, commenting that the scene will not make the movie&#x27;s final cut, that nobody would want to see it. That same year, the Middle East produced their own Snickers commercial featuring DC Comics&#x27; The Joker as the recipient of the Snickers bar, before turning back into a casual poker playing buddy.

In 2018, Brazil World Cup winner Ronaldo is seen celebrating a goal for Argentina. When he notices the confused faces around him, he eats a Snickers and returns to normal.

The UK version of the campaign usually used British celebrities and, up until 2018, retained the slogan from the Mr. T. era. In the initial advertisement, Joan Collins and Stephanie Beacham featured as locker room footballers who had turned into them due to being hungry. In 2014, Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean returned on television by appearing on several UK Snickers commercials and cinema spots, in place of a martial arts master who had turned into him as a result of hunger. Later, in 2018, Elton John appeared in an advertisement where he turned into African American rapper Boogie after he eats a Snickers; the latter had turned into the former due to hunger (the slogan appeared on a turntable in this advertisement).

===Nitro Sponsorship===
In 2013, Snickers began to sponsor Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure.

===Maybe You Just Need A Snickers===
In 2020, a new campaign was trialed, focusing on the theme of people doing things that contradicted what they think they are doing, such as a man crawling along rocky ground when he thought he was climbing a rock face, the new slogan for this commercial, &quot;Confused? Maybe you just need a Snickers&quot;, indicating hunger-induced confusion. Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure also features this advertisement style (see above). This campaign was revived in the UK in 2024 to promote the 2024 UEFA European Football Championships, featuring footballers Bukayo Saka and Luka Modrić.

===WrestleMania===
Snickers has been an official sponsor of WWE&#x27;s WrestleMania events, including WrestleMania 2000, 22, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and XL, while its Cruncher variant sponsored WrestleMania X-Seven, XIX, XX and 21. Since then, Snickers has sponsored superstars such as Enzo Amore and Big Cass with their signature term, SAWFT, which is labelled at the back of the chocolate bar.

===Six Flags Fright Fest===
Since 2011, Snickers has been the official sponsor of Six Flags&#x27; annual Fright Fest event at its theme parks.

==Controversy==
=== King-Size phaseout ===
A replacement for the king size Snickers bar was launched in the UK in 2004, and designed to conform to the September 2004 Food and Drink Federation (FDF) &quot;Manifesto for Food and Health&quot;. Part of the FDF manifesto was seven pledges of action to encourage the food and drink industry to be more health conscious. Reducing portion size, clearer food labels, and reduction of the levels of fat, sugar, and salt were among the FDF pledges. Mars Incorporated pledged to phase out their king-size bars in 2005 and replace them with shareable bars. A Mars spokesman said: &quot;Our king-size bars that come in one portion will be changed so they are shareable or can be consumed on more than one occasion. The name king-size will be phased out.&quot;

These were eventually replaced by the &#x27;Duo&#x27; – a double bar pack. Though this change to Duos reduced the weight from , the price remained the same. The packaging has step-by-step picture instructions of how to open a Duo into two bars, in four simple actions. As Mars stated fulfillment of their promise, the Duo format was met with criticism by the National Obesity Forum and National Consumer Council.

=== Australian recall ===
In December 2000, tens of thousands of Snickers and Mars Bars were removed from New South Wales store shelves due to a series of threatening letters which resulted in fears that the chocolate bars had been poisoned. Mars received letters from an unidentified individual indicating that they planned to plant poisoned chocolate bars on store shelves. The last letter sent included a Snickers bar contaminated with a substance which was later identified as rat poison. The letters claimed that there were seven additional chocolate bars which had been tampered with and which were for sale to the public. As a precautionary measure, Mars issued a massive recall. Mars said that there had been no demand for money and complaints directed to an unidentified third party.

===Accusations of homophobia===
Snickers aired a commercial in Spain in August 2021. The 20-second video featured Spanish influencer Aless Gibaja at a restaurant, ordering &quot;a sexy orange juice with Vitamins A, B, and C.&quot; A nearby friend, seeming confused, offers a Snickers bar—as part of the candy bar&#x27;s ongoing marketing slogan of &quot;You&#x27;re not you when you&#x27;re hungry&quot;—and Gibaja is seemingly transformed into a bearded man with a low voice. The video began circulating online after airing, and received criticism as it was perceived to be homophobic. Irene Montero, Spain&#x27;s Minister for Equality, condemned the commercial, questioning &quot;to whom it might have seemed like a good idea to use homophobia as a business strategy&quot;. She also added that it was &quot;shameful and unfortunate&quot; for Snickers to &quot;continue to perpetuate stereotypes and promote homophobia&quot;. Snickers later ceased airing the commercial and issued an apology for &quot;any misunderstanding&quot;.

<doc id="446645" wikidata="Q5630732" url="?curid=446645" title="HMCS Buctouche">
<text>HMCS &quot;Buctouche&quot; was a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) during the Second World War. She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic escorting merchant ship convoys. Constructed by Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec, the vessel was laid down 14 August 1940 and was launched on 20 November that year. The corvette was named for Bouctouche, New Brunswick and was commissioned on 5 June 1941. &quot;Buctouche&quot; successfully damaged a U-boat during an engagement off the Avalon Peninsula. In 1944, the vessel went aground at Hamilton Inlet, Labrador. Following the war, the ship was decommissioned on 23 October 1945 and was sold for scrap in 1949.

==Design and description==

Flower-class corvettes such as &quot;Buctouche&quot; serving with the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) in the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The Flower-class corvettes originated from a need that arose in 1938 to expand the Royal Navy following the Munich Crisis. A design request went out for a small escort for coastal convoys. Based on a traditional whaler-type design, the initial Canadian ships of the Flower class had a standard displacement of . They were long overall with a beam of and a maximum draught of . The initial 1939–1940 corvettes were powered by a four-cylinder vertical triple expansion engine powered by steam from two Scotch boilers turning one three-bladed propeller rated at . The Scotch boilers were replaced with water-tube boilers in later 1939–1940 and 1940–1941 Programme ships. The corvettes had a maximum speed of . This gave them a range of at . The vessels were extremely wet.

The Canadian Flower-class vessels were initially armed with a Mk IX BL gun forward on a CP 1 mounting and carried 100 rounds per gun. The corvettes were also armed with a QF Vickers 2-pounder () gun on a bandstand aft, two single-mounted .303 Vickers machine guns or Browning 0.5-calibre machine guns for anti-aircraft defence and two twin-mounted .303 Lewis machine guns, usually sited on bridge wings. For anti-submarine warfare, they mounted two depth charge throwers and initially carried 25 depth charges. The corvettes were designed with a Type 123 ASDIC sonar set installed. The Flower-class ships had a complement of 47 officers and ratings. The Royal Canadian Navy initially ordered 54 corvettes in 1940 and these were fitted with Mark II Oropesa minesweeping gear used for destroying contact mines. Part of the depth charge rails were made portable so the minesweeping gear could be utilised.

===Modifications===
In Canadian service the vessels were altered due to experience with the design&#x27;s deficiencies. The galley was moved further back in the ship and the mess and sleeping quarters combined. A wireless direction finding set was added, and enlarged bilge keels were installed to reduce rolling. After the first 35–40 corvettes had been constructed, the foremast was shifted aft of the bridge and the mainmast was eliminated. Corvettes were first fitted with basic SW-1 and SW-2 CQ surface warning radar, notable for their fishbone-like antenna and reputation for failure in poor weather or in the dark. The compass house was moved further aft and the open-type bridge was situated in front of it. The ASDIC hut was moved in front and to a lower position on the bridge. The improved Type 271 radar was placed aft, with some units receiving Type 291 radar for air search. The minesweeping gear, a feature of the first 54 corvettes, was removed. Most Canadian Flower-class corvettes had their forecastles extended which improved crew accommodation and seakeeping. Furthermore, the sheer and flare of the bow was increased, which led to an enlarged bridge. This allowed for the installation of Oerlikon cannon, replacing the Browning and Vickers machine guns. Some of the corvettes were rearmed with Hedgehog anti-submarine mortars. The complements of the ships grew throughout the war rising from the initial 47 to as many as 104.

==Construction and career==
The corvette was ordered as part of the 1939–1940 Flower-class building programme. The vessel was laid down by Davie Shipbuilding &amp; Repairing Co. Ltd. at their yard in Lauzon, Quebec on 14 August 1940 and was launched on 20 November that year. &quot;Buctouche&quot;, named for the community in New Brunswick, was commissioned into the RCN on 5 June 1941 at Quebec City.

After working up, &quot;Buctouche&quot; joined the Newfoundland Escort Force in July 1941. She escorted merchant ship convoys through the Battle of the Atlantic from St. John&#x27;s to Iceland beginning August 1941 with Escort Group (EG) 21. On her first convoy mission with convoy SC 41, the group was rerouted around a German U-boat wolfpack. The following escort mission for the convoy ONS 36 went untroubled. However, SC 52, which departed Sydney, Nova Scotia on 29 October, which was escorted by &quot;Buctouche&quot;″s escort group had to change course due to U-boat wolfpacks before they had left North American coastal waters. The convoy was discovered by the wolfpacks on 1 November and the first defence of the convoy began that night by the Free French corvette . The first merchant ship victims were sunk on 2 November. The number of attacks on the convoy before it had got to open sea forced the British Admiralty to turn the convoy back on 3 November, the only convoy to be forced to return to base in the entire war. Two more merchants were sunk and &quot;Buctouche&quot; and recovered the crews of and . With the strength of the attacks worsening, the convoy commander ordered it to scatter and the battle ended with seven merchant ships lost and no U-boats. &quot;Buctouche&quot;″s following convoy assignments, SC 58, ONS 48, SC 64, and ONS 60 went undisturbed by German attacks.

In June 1942 &quot;Buctouche&quot; transferred to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) escorting convoys mainly in North American waters. In June 1943, new escort groups were formed and &quot;Buctouche&quot; was assigned to EG W-1. On 21 November 1943, &quot;Buctouche&quot;, now a part of EG W-2, was escorting the outbound convoy ON 145 off the Avalon Peninsula when it came under attack by U-boats. Three vessels were hit, but only one, , sank. &quot;Buctouche&quot; attacked after the submarine had been spotted by the merchant ships. The corvette&#x27;s attack seriously damaged the U-boat and forced &quot;U-518&quot; to break off and return to base. &quot;Buctouche&quot; underwent a refit at the end of 1943 that was completed on 29 January 1944 that extended the ship&#x27;s forecastle. In mid-1944 &quot;Buctouche&quot; was assigned to Quebec Force for two months. On 28 June 1944, the corvette went aground at Hamilton Inlet, Labrador, but was freed and sailed for Pictou, Nova Scotia where the vessel spent the next two months under repair. &quot;Buctouche&quot; was paid off on 23 October 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. The corvette was sold for scrap and broken up in 1949 at Hamilton. For service during the Second World War, the ship was awarded the battle honour &quot;Atlantic 1939–45&quot;.

<text>The 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)—nicknamed the &quot;Red Diamond&quot;, or the &quot;Red Devils&quot; —was an infantry division of the United States Army that served in World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War, and with NATO and the U.S. Army III Corps. It was deactivated on 24 November 1992 and reflagged as the 2nd Armored Division.

==World War I==
===Organization===

On 17 November 1917, the War Department directed the organization of the 5th Division with headquarters at Camp Logan, Texas, around a cadre of Regular Army troops that had been stationed at Camp Logan, Camp Forrest, Georgia, Camp Greene, North Carolina, Camp Johnston, Florida, Camp Stanley, Texas, and Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Major General Charles H. Muir assumed command on 11 December 1917. The organization was a &quot;square&quot; division (i.e., there were four infantry regiments) with an authorized strength of 28,105 personnel.

Units associated with the division included:
* Headquarters, 5th Division
* 9th Infantry Brigade
** 60th Infantry Regiment (formed with a cadre from the 7th Infantry)
** 61st Infantry Regiment (formed with a cadre from the 7th Infantry)
** 14th Machine Gun Battalion
*10th Infantry Brigade
** 6th Infantry Regiment
** 11th Infantry Regiment
** 15th Machine Gun Battalion
* 5th Field Artillery Brigade
** 19th Field Artillery Regiment (75 mm) (formed with a cadre from the 7th Field Artillery)
** 20th Field Artillery Regiment (75 mm) (formed with a cadre from the 7th Field Artillery)
** 21st Field Artillery Regiment (155 mm) (formed with a cadre from the 3rd Field Artillery)
** 5th Trench Mortar Battery
* 13th Machine Gun Battalion
* 7th Engineer Regiment
* 9th Field Signal Battalion
* Headquarters Troop, 5th Division
* 5th Train Headquarters and Military Police
** 5th Ammunition Train
** 5th Supply Train
** 5th Engineer Train
** 5th Sanitary Train
*** 17th, 25th, 29th, and 30th Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals

The entire division arrived in France by 1 May 1918 and components of the units were deployed into the front line. The 5th Division was the eighth of forty-two American divisions to arrive on the Western Front. The 5th Division trained with French Army units from 1 to 14 June 1918. The first soldiers of the unit to be killed in action died on 14 June of that year. Among the division&#x27;s first casualties was Captain Mark W. Clark, then commanding the 3rd Battalion, 11th Infantry Regiment, who would later become a four-star general. On 12 September, the unit was part of a major attack that reduced the salient at St. Mihiel. The division later fought in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, the largest battle fought by the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) (and the largest in the history of the U.S. Armed Forces) in World War I. The war ended soon after, on November 11, 1918.

The division then served for the next few months in the Army of Occupation, being based in Belgium and Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg until it departed Europe. The division returned to the United States through the New York Port of Embarkation at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 21 July 1919.

===Insignia===
The 5th Division adopted a red diamond as its shoulder sleeve insignia. The color red was selected in honor of World War I commander John E. McMahon, who was a member of the Army&#x27;s Field Artillery branch. The diamond shape was chosen in recognition of the Diamond Dyes company, a maker of fabric coloring products whose ad slogan &quot;It Never Runs&quot; conveyed a martial meaning during war. The shape of the diamond in the 5th Division&#x27;s insignia represents strength, because in bridge construction the trusses that provide the greatest durability are mutually supporting isosceles triangles.

==Interwar period==

Upon arrival at Camp Merritt, New Jersey, emergency period personnel were discharged from the service. The division proceeded to Camp Gordon, Georgia, arrived there 26 July, and remained there until October 1920, when it was transferred to Camp Jackson, South Carolina, for permanent station. As a part of the War Department&#x27;s decision to maintain only three fully-active stateside infantry divisions, the 5th Division was inactivated, less the 10th Infantry Brigade and several smaller units, on 4 October 1921 at Camp Jackson. The 5th Division was allotted to the Fifth Corps Area for mobilization responsibility, and assigned to the V Corps. Camp Knox, Kentucky, was designated as the mobilization and training station for the division upon reactivation. During the period 1921–39, the active elements of the 5th Division consisted of the 10th Infantry Brigade and other assorted divisional elements which formed the base force from which the remainder of the division would be reactivated in the event of war. 

The division headquarters was organized on 5 May 1926 as a &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) unit with Organized Reserve personnel at Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indiana, and functioned in essentially the same manner as the headquarters of an Organized Reserve division. The Headquarters, Fifth Corps Area, subsequently ordered the headquarters to cease operations on 1 September 1927, and all Regular Army personnel assigned to the headquarters were relieved. Though the command functions of the division ceased, Reserve personnel remained assigned to the division headquarters for training, mobilization, and assignment purposes. By 1927, most of the inactive elements of the division were also organized with Reserve personnel as RAI units. The RAI units generally trained with the active elements of the division during summer training camps. Several units, such as the 5th Medical Regiment, 19th and 21st Field Artillery Regiments, and the 60th and 61st Infantry Regiments were affiliated with various colleges and universities sponsoring ROTC and organized as RAI units with the Regular Army cadre and commissionees from the schools’ programs. The active elements of the division also maintained habitual training relationships with units of the V Corps, XV Corps, and the 83rd, 84th, and 100th Divisions. The training of those Reserve units was usually conducted at Camp Knox and at the regimental home stations of the 10th and 11th Infantry Regiments. These two regiments also supported the Reserve units’ conduct of the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Camp Knox, Fort Benjamin Harrison, and Fort Thomas, Kentucky. 

The 10th Infantry Brigade, reinforced by the active elements of the 5th Tank Company, 19th Field Artillery Regiment, 5th Quartermaster Regiment, and the 6th Division&#x27;s 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, held maneuvers in those years when funds were available, at Camp Knox. During these maneuvers, the 5th Division headquarters was occasionally formed in a provisional status to train Regular and Reserve officers in division-level command and control procedures. The division headquarters was also provisionally formed for the August 1936 Second Army maneuvers at Fort Knox. For that maneuver, the division (10th Infantry Brigade as the nucleus) was reinforced by the 1st Signal Company and the West Virginia National Guard’s 201st Infantry, in addition to the other active divisional elements.

==World War II==
On 16 October 1939, the 5th Division was reactivated as part of the United States mobilization in response to the outbreak of World War II in Europe the previous month, being formed at Fort McClellan, Alabama, under the command of Brigadier General Campbell Hodges.

The following spring, in 1940, the division was sent to Fort Benning, Georgia, and then temporarily to Louisiana for training exercises, before being transferred to Fort Benjamin Harrison at the end of May 1940. That December the division relocated to Fort Custer, Michigan, from where it participated in the Tennessee maneuvers. The division went next to Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Arkansas, in August 1941 to stage for both the Arkansas and Louisiana Maneuvers, before returning to Fort Custer that October. The division, having been under the command of Major General Cortlandt Parker from August, was there when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, thus bringing the United States into the conflict. As the winter passed, the division was brought up to strength and fully equipped for forward deployment into a war zone. During April 1942, the 5th Division received its overseas orders and departed the New York Port of Embarkation (NYPOE) at the end of the month for Iceland. The 5th Division debarked there in May 1942, where it replaced the British garrison on the island outpost along the Atlantic convoy routes and a year later was reorganized and re-designated as the 5th Infantry Division on 24 May 1943.

===Normandy===
The 5th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Stafford LeRoy Irwin, left Iceland in early August 1943 and was sent to England to prepare and train for the eventual invasion of Northwest Europe, then scheduled for the spring of 1944. Upon arrival in England the 5th Division was stationed at Tidworth Barracks in South West England, before moving to Northern Ireland.

After two years of training the 5th ID landed in Normandy on Utah Beach, on 9 July 1944, over a month after the initial D-Day landings, and four days later took up defensive positions in the vicinity of Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé. Launching a successful attack at Vidouville 26 July, the division drove on southeast of Saint-Lô, attacked and captured Angers, 9–10 August, captured Chartres, (assisted by the 7th Armored Division), 18 August, pushed to Fontainebleau, crossed the Seine at Montereau, 24 August, crossed the Marne and seized Reims, 30 August, and positions east of Verdun. The division then prepared for the assault on Metz, 7 September. In mid-September a bridgehead was secured across the Moselle, south of Metz, at Dornot and Arnaville after two attempts. The first attempt at Dornot by the 11th Infantry Regiment failed. German-held Fort Driant played a role in repulsing this crossing. A second crossing by the 10th Infantry Regiment at Arnaville was successful. The division continued operations against Metz, 16 September to 16 October 1944, withdrew, then returned to the assault on 9 November. Metz finally fell 22 November. The division crossed the German border, 4 December, captured Lauterbach (a suburb of Völklingen) on the 5th, and elements reached the west bank of the river Saar, 6 December, before the division moved to assembly areas.

On 16 December, the Germans launched their winter offensive in the Ardennes forest, the Battle of the Bulge, and on the 18th the 5th ID was thrown in against the southern flank of the Bulge, helping to reduce it by the end of January 1945. In February and March, the division drove across and northeast of the Sauer, where it smashed through the Siegfried Line and later took part in the Allied invasion of Germany.

===Across the Rhine===
The 5th ID crossed the river Rhine at Nierstein on the night of 22 March 1945. After capturing some 19,000 German soldiers, the division continued to Frankfurt-am-Main, clearing and policing the town and its environs, 27–29 March. In April the 5th ID, now commanded by Major General Albert E. Brown, after Major General Irwin&#x27;s promotion to command of XII Corps, took part in clearing the Ruhr Pocket and then drove across the Czechoslovak border, 1 May, reaching Volary and Vimperk as the war in Europe ended.
===Casualties===
* Total battle casualties: 12,818
* Killed in action: 2,298
* Wounded in action: 9,549
* Missing in action: 288
* Prisoner of war: 683

===Order of battle===
Under the new &quot;triangular&quot; organization, units assigned included:

==Post–World War II==
Following World War II, the 5th Infantry Division was inactivated on 20 September 1946 at Camp Campbell (now Fort) Kentucky. However, the division was reactivated on 15 July 1947 under Brigadier General John H. Church. From 1951 to 1953, the division was stationed at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania, and trained 30,000 replacements for the Korean War. The later part of the 1950s saw the division stationed in West Germany as part of the U.S. contribution to NATO, though the division later returned to the United States.

==Vietnam War==
When the 1st Infantry Division deployed to South Vietnam in 1965, additional maneuver battalions were required; thus two infantry battalions from the 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division, at Fort Devens in Massachusetts were relieved and assigned to &quot;The Big Red One.&quot; In September 1965, the 2nd Brigade, 5th Infantry Division was moved, minus personnel, to Fort Carson in Colorado and refilled there. The remaining personnel at Fort Devens formed the basis of the 196th Infantry Brigade.

By 1968 the division was stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado, as a mechanized formation. 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division was dispatched to South Vietnam after the Tet Offensive to replace a U.S. Marine Corps unit. The brigade, consisting of one battalion each of infantry, mechanized infantry and armor, served there from July 1968 until 1971 defending the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone in northern Quảng Trị Province. Combat units included 1st Battalion, 11th Infantry; 1st Battalion, 61st Infantry (Mechanized); 1st Battalion, 77th Armor; A Troop, 4th Squadron, 12th Cavalry; and 5th Battalion, 4th Artillery, A Company, 7th Engineer Battalion (Society of the Fifth Division). On 22 August 1971, the colors of 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division were cased and the brigade was inactivated at Fort Carson. Its final assignment was to III Corps, with the mission of reinforcing Europe if a general war was to break out there. In September 1969 the 4th Brigade, 5th Infantry Division was activated at Fort Carson, although, on the later return of 4th Infantry Division home from Vietnam in December 1970, the 4th Division replaced the 5th Division at Fort Carson, whereupon the 5th Division was inactivated.

==Post-Vietnam==
On 21 October 1974 the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division was reactivated at Fort Polk in Louisiana as part of the Army&#x27;s new 24-division force. Due to lack of sufficient housing, the brigade initially only had two maneuver battalions. (Maneuver and Firepower, Chap XIII) The division base and a second brigade was organized in 1975–77, and the Louisiana Army National Guard&#x27;s 256th Infantry Brigade was assigned as the &#x27;round-out&#x27; third brigade of the division.

In 1989, units of the 5th Division, based at Fort Polk deployed in support of Operation Nimrod Dancer to protect American interests in Panama. First Battalion, 61st Infantry (Mechanized), &quot;Roadrunners&quot; (1st Brigade, 5th ID) was one of the first reinforcing units and remained there until September when there was a hand over to 4th Battalion, Sixth Infantry (Mechanized), &quot;Regulars&quot; (2nd Brigade, 5th ID). 4–6 Infantry was in country and assisted during Operation Just Cause helping to overthrow Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, and also assisted in an emergency extraction of Delta Force operators engaged in Operation Acid Gambit when their helicopter went down. Two Soldiers were killed in action from the 5th Infantry Division during Just Cause: CPL Ivan M. Perez and PVT Kenneth D. Scott.

In August 1990, the 5th Division was alerted to prepare for deployment in support of Operation Desert Shield, and the Louisiana Army National Guard&#x27;s 256th Infantry Brigade was mobilized as the &#x27;round-out&#x27; third brigade in November. The Division began sending units to train at Fort Hood, and established a division headquarters-forward (5ID-(Fwd)) at the Texas base to prepare for deployment. The plan was to get all elements of the 256th Brigade up to standards, and then complete a rotation at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin before the division deployed to Southwest Asia. The 5ID (fwd) immediately encountered problems with the 256th Brigade units, and training began to suffer as a result. Several members of the 256th Brigade went AWOL, while others refused to train as directed. These delays prevented the Division from deploying to Fort Irwin, and the subsequent rapid start and end of Operation Desert Storm effectively kept the Division from ultimately deploying to Southwest Asia in any capacity. All units returned to Fort Polk by March 1991, with the 256th Brigade demobilization occurring later in May of that same year.

The 5th Division remained at Fort Polk until it was inactivated and reflagged as the 2nd Armored Division November 1992.

(Partial list)
==Inactivation==
The division was inactivated for the final time on 24 November 1992, and reflagged as the U.S. 2nd Armored Division as part of the post-Cold War drawdown of U.S. forces. The 2nd Armored Division moved from Fort Polk to Fort Hood in 1993, with the majority of the 5th Division&#x27;s equipment.

Though it was inactivated, the division was identified as the third highest priority inactive division in the United States Army Center of Military History&#x27;s lineage scheme due to its numerous accolades and long history. All of the division&#x27;s flags and heraldic items were moved to the National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning, Georgia, following its inactivation. Should the U.S. Army decide to activate more divisions in the future, the center will most likely suggest the first new division be the 9th Infantry Division, the second be the 24th Infantry Division, the third be the 5th Infantry Division, and the fourth be the 2nd Armored Division.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; miniatures role-playing game, a U.S. infantry unit was designated &quot;Red Devil Captain.&quot;

In the &quot;&quot; role-playing game, players start out as members of the 5th ID in July 2000, after the division is overrun by Soviet and Polish units near Kalisz, Poland during a hypothetical World War III.

In the 1981 movie Taps, the Red Diamond patch of the 5ID is worn by a Master Sergeant who is the father of one of the cadets at the school.

In the Bethesda Studios game Fallout 4, in the beginning section it is mentioned that the 5ID is stationed in Southeast Asia.

<text>The Kayseri Province () is a province and metropolitan municipality in central Turkey. Its area is 16,970 km2, and its population is 1,441,523 (2022). It borders with Sivas, Adana, Niğde, Kahramanmaraş, Yozgat and Nevşehir provinces.

The province is an area that has been linked with mythological stories as well as important figures in Turkish history. It is located in Anatolia, and surrounded by the Mount Erciyes, the Mount Hasan and the Mount Ali. The Ali mountain is named like that in honor of Ali Baba, who is said to have lived in the area. Locals claim that Kayseri is the most peaceful city in the world.

==Districts==

==History==

It was the residence of the Cappadocian kings and was sacked by Tigranes I, king of Armenia, in the 1st century BCE. Kayseri was first known as the city of &quot;Masaka&quot;. Later, during the Roman period, the province&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Caesarea&quot;, then &quot;Kayzer&quot; before becoming known with its modern name of &quot;Kayseri&quot;. Danishmend Gazi conquered Kayseri in 1084. The Seljuk Empire then modernised the province, with new buildings and mosques being built around. During this period, the &quot;Şifahane&quot;, Kayseri&#x27;s first hospital, and perhaps the first hospital in all of Anatolia, was built. It was built in honor of Princess Gevher Nesibe Hatun, daughter of the Sultan. She died of a disease at a young age. Construction of the hospital was completed in 1206.

Later on, Kayseri became a cultural mecca of poets, artists in Turkey. Seyyid Burhaneddin lived there, and so did others such as Kadı Burhaneddin and Seyrani, among many others. Seynari was born in 1807. Sinan the Great, an Ottoman architect, was also from Kayseri.

According to Turkish mythology, a man named Hasan Baba would cross mountains during the month of August every year and bring Ali Baba snow, which would not melt.

The province roughly corresponds to the ancient region of Cappadocia.
==Modern Kayseri==
Kayseri is nowadays a province filled with modern buildings and museums. Some of Turkey&#x27;s most famous statues and monuments are located there. The modern city of Kayseri is in the Melikgazi district.
==Demographics==
Sultan Abdulaziz accommodated the Kabardians (a Circassian tribe) in Uzunyayla (Kayseri). As a result, Kayseri has a significant Circassian population. In the 1965 census, 3.2% of the population reported Circassian as their first language. 23% of all Circassians in Turkey were in Kayseri.

==Transportation in Kayseri==
Apart from taxi and bus transportation, Kayseri has a modern airport, Kayseri International Airport is served by 13 airlines, including Turkish Airlines and it has Kayseray which is the in-city rail system of main public transportation element in Kayseri.

<doc id="446671" wikidata="Q5874620" url="?curid=446671" title="Hob Gadling">
<text>Hob Gadling, also known as Robert, Robbie, or Bobby, is a fictional character from the &quot;Sandman&quot; comic book series by Neil Gaiman. Gadling first appears in issue #13, &quot;Men of Good Fortune&quot;. A soldier who has recently fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Gadling argues with friends about the nature of death in an inn located in what will become modern-day London. He develops significance both as a recurrent character in the series and friend to Dream, appearing in a total of seven issues spanning six hundred years.

Hob Gadling appears in the Netflix drama series &quot;The Sandman&quot; (2022), portrayed by Ferdinand Kingsley.

== Appearances ==

Gadling first appears in vol. 2, &quot;The Doll&#x27;s House&quot; issue #13, &quot;Men of Good Fortune&quot; in 1389, sitting in a smoky tavern, the White Horse, in what will eventually become the East End of London. Gadling is arguing that if he refuses to die, he will have eternal life. Dying, he argues, is merely a habit, something that people do simply because everybody does. It is, as Gadling puts it, &quot;a mug&#x27;s game&quot;. This catches the attention of Death, who encourages Dream to listen. Death agrees, at the request of her brother, who says that &quot;it might be amusing&quot; to grant Gadling eternal life. Dream strikes up a conversation with Gadling who agrees to meet him again in the same inn once every hundred years.

They do so, and Gadling recounts each century of his life. In the century following his initial appearance and meeting with Dream, Gadling continues fighting as a soldier and gets into the new field of printing (1389–1489 AD). In the next century, he becomes rich, marries and is knighted (1489–1589 AD). Over the course of the next three hundred years, he falls into disgrace following the premature death of his wife and child (1589–1689 AD), enters the slave trade to again become wealthy (1689–1789 AD), and exits it after Dream comments on its immorality (1789–1889 AD).

In 1789, their meeting is interrupted by the arrival of magician Lady Johanna Constantine, ancestor of John Constantine, who says she heard it rumoured that once every hundred years, the Devil and the Wandering Jew meet there in that very same tavern.

 In the penultimate meeting in 1889, Gadling suggests to Dream that the true purpose for meeting was friendship. Dream rejects the suggestion angrily and walks out. In 1989 Dream, freshly escaped after decades of captivity, returns, stating that it is impolite to keep a friend waiting, confirming their friendship.

In issue #22, collected in &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, Dream visits Hob in his dreams while preparing for a visit to Hell. He gives Hob a bottle of Château Lafitte 1828, which remains material in the waking world.

He next appears in issue #53, &quot;Hob&#x27;s Leviathan&quot;, which recounts a portion of Hob’s biography independent of the Dream King; the story, which takes place on a ship called the &quot;Sea Witch&quot; in the first half of the 20th century, forms a section of the frame narrative which comprises &quot;Worlds&#x27; End&quot;. In it he shares an adventure with a girl named Peggy; Peggy and Hob appear again, albeit briefly, during the Blitz in issue #32 of &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.

The narrative later reunites Hob and Dream in issue #59 of &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;. Having lost his most recent significant other in a car accident, Hob is devastated and asks Dream to resurrect her, remarking that &quot;it never gets easier, people you love not being there any more&quot;. Dream states that such an act is impossible, but offers Hob the comfort of making her killer aware, while dreaming, of that which he has destroyed. As they leave Hob warns Dream that he has the stench of death upon him, which Dream responds with an ambiguous smile and thanks.

Hob’s final three appearances occur in issues #70 (&quot;Chapter One, Which Occurs in the Wake of What Has Gone Before&quot;), #72 (&quot;Chapter Three, In Which We Wake&quot;), and #73 (&quot;An Epilogue, Sunday Mourning&quot;) of &quot;The Wake&quot;. In &quot;Sunday Mourning&quot;, Hob attends a Renaissance festival with his African-American girlfriend Guenevere and reminisces guiltily about the slave trade. Disgruntled by the inaccuracy of the event, he spends most of the afternoon drinking in a derelict tavern, somewhat similar to the one in which he first met Dream. While there, he is visited by Death who, reflecting that Hob may have reconsidered his pact for eternal life since Dream&#x27;s death, offers him an end. He thanks Death for the offer but ultimately refuses, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not ready to die. Not today. Not yet. Maybe not ever. Anyway, Gwen&#x27;d kill me.&quot; The issue concludes with Hob dreaming of walking on a beach with Dream and Destruction.

He also makes an appearance in &quot;The Sandman Presents: Dead Boy Detectives&quot; spinoff, where Gilles De Rais tricks Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine into tracking Gadling down in an attempt to harvest his immortality. De Rais&#x27; plot is foiled when he is tricked into turning down Hob&#x27;s particular brand of eternal life in favour of the extended feeling of childhood the Dead Boy Detectives experience, overlooking the fact that they have no life to steal.

==Characterization==
Gadling, like Element Girl, is one of several humans in &quot;The Sandman&quot; series who do not age.

By 1989, Gadling comes to regret his involvement in the Atlantic slave trade, an occupation Morpheus advised him to forgo centuries before. Having apologized repeatedly to his 20th century girlfriend in &quot;Sunday Mourning&quot;, he is told by Gwen to drop the subject. When he responds &quot;You can&#x27;t just forget about it&quot;, she answers &quot;Sure you can, Robbie. You know how? You just forget about it&quot;, echoing the structure of Gadling&#x27;s own earlier thoughts on death in &quot;Men of Good Fortune&quot;: &quot;The only reason people die, is because everyone does it. You all just go along with it. It&#x27;s rubbish, death. It&#x27;s stupid. I don&#x27;t want anything to do with it.&quot;

==Creation and concept==
Gaiman has said that he based Gadling&#x27;s speech pattern on that of British actor Bob Hoskins, particularly in the film &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;. He has been regularly portrayed as a man of middle height with slightly receding reddish-brown hair, but only in &quot;Sunday Mourning&quot; did artist Michael Zulli base his appearance on a specific person: Ian Anderson, lead singer of rock band Jethro Tull. Over the course of the series, Hob has been penciled by Kelley Jones, Michael Zulli, Bryan Talbot, and Marc Hempel; inked by Malcolm Jones III, David Giordano, Mark Buckingham, and D&#x27;Israeli; and colored by Steve Oliff and Daniel Vozzo.

==In other media==
* Hob Gadling appears in the 2022 TV series based on &quot;The Sandman&quot;, portrayed by Ferdinand Kingsley. Just like previously, he was granted immortality and agelessness by Death; with Dream meeting him on the same day once a century, to see if he would be ready to accept dying. Despite the ups and downs of each century, Hob refuses to die; even pondering if Dream feels lonely, with his immortality an excuse for friendship. Dream took offense in their 1889 meeting, shortly afterward missing their next meeting due to being detained. Hob was happy to see Dream make up from missing the correct year, by showing up on the right day as Dream followed the directions left for him to their new meeting place after John Dee&#x27;s defeat and spending the day with Death. Dream admitted, albeit indirectly, that he did consider Hob a friend.

* Hob Gadling appears in the Audible original audio drama &quot;The Sandman&quot;, voiced by Matthew Horne.

<text>Gutnish ( ), or rarely Gutnic ( or ), is a North Germanic language spoken sporadically on the islands of Gotland and Fårö. The different dialects of Gutnish, while stemming from the Old Gutnish () variety of Old Norse, are sometimes considered part of modern Swedish. Gutnish exists in two variants, Mainland Gutnish (&quot;Storlandsgutamål&quot; or &quot;Storlandsmål&quot;), mostly spoken in the southern and southeastern portion of Gotland, where the dialect of Lau became the standard form on the Main Island (&quot;Lau Gutnish&quot; → &quot;Laumål&quot;), and Fårö Gutnish (Gutnish: &quot;Faroymal&quot;; ), spoken on the island of Fårö. UNESCO defines Gutnish as a &quot;definitely endangered language&quot; as of 2010.

Some features of Gutnish include the preservation of Old Norse diphthongs like &quot;ai&quot; in for instance (; English: &quot;stone&quot;) and &quot;oy&quot; in for example (; English: &quot;die&quot;). There is also a triphthong that exists in no other Norse languages: &quot;iau&quot; as in / (; English: &quot;shoot&quot;).

Many Gotlanders do not understand Gutnish, and speak Gotlandic (), a Gutnish-influenced Swedish dialect.

There are major efforts to revive the traditional version of Modern Gutnish and Gutamålsgillet, the Gutnish Language Guild, organizes classes and meetings for speakers of traditional Gutnish. According to the guild&#x27;s webpage, there are now 1,500 people using Gutnish on Facebook.

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
The contrastive vowels in Modern Gutnish are , , , , , , . Of these, all but have a short and a long version. What is etymologically a long has been broken into the sequence .

A distinctive feature of Gutnish is the existence of a large number of sequences of vowel plus or which form vocalic phonemes of their own. These sequences are the following: , , , , , , , , .

Some of these sequences alternate with short vowels between different morphological forms of the same lexeme, cf. such pairs as &quot;veit&quot; &#x27;white&#x27; (f.) ~ &#x27;white&#x27; (n).

* , when preceding other vowels, , or post-alveolar sounds, have a tendency to be more open .
* In Fårö Gutnish, are further backed .
* may be realized as more close when preceding a sonorant.
* may be when unstressed.

===Consonants===

* Voiceless stops may be aspirated .

==Lexicon==
Gutnish has many words of its own that make it different from Swedish. The following is a small selection of Gutnish&#x27;s everyday vocabulary:

==Status==
Gutnish is now under strong influence from the Swedish standard language, both through speaker contact and through media and (perhaps most importantly) written language. As a result, Gutnish has become much closer to the Swedish standard language. Due to the island&#x27;s Danish and Hanseatic period there were also influences from Danish and Low German. There are also many Gotlanders who do not learn the language, but speak a regionally colored variant of the standard Swedish (Gotlandic). This is characterized mainly by its intonation, but also by diphthongs and triphthongs, some lexical peculiarities as well as the infinitive ending &quot;-ä.&quot;

The &quot;Gutamålsgillet&quot; association, which has been working for the preservation and revitalization of Gutnish since 1945, estimates that Gutnish is spoken today by 2,000 to 5,000 people. How many are still passive, is not specified. However, an interest in Gutnish seems to be present: From 1989 to 2011, the radio show &quot;Gutamål&quot; ran in Radio Gotland, which regularly reached about 15,000 to 20,000 listeners, and in 2008 Gotland University offered their first course in Gutnish. Gutamålsgillet collects writings of authors and poets who write their texts in Gutnish, and maintains a Swedish-Gutnish dictionary and an ever-growing list of Gotlandic neologisms.

In 2022, a citizen of the island of Gotland asked to use her surname with the Gutnish ending &quot;-dotri&quot; (instead of Swedish &quot;-dotter&quot;). The authority appealed against the positive decision of the administrative court in Stockholm, but in the end, the Court of Appeal ruled that she was allowed to use a Gutnish surname.

== Economy ==


Mediaș is the second industrial center after Sibiu in the county.
From the 14th to 19th centuries, various manufacturers and professionals were members of associations based on their trades called &quot;bresle&quot; (guilds), the first two unions were the ones formed by tailors and cloth makers, in 1457. In 1698, Mediaș already had 33 unions.

In the 19th century, unions started to merge and build factories. The first factory, called &quot;Karres&quot;, was established in 1881 and produced various leather products. In 1888, a factory that manufactured cloth and various textiles was built, followed in 1895 by a factory called &quot;Salconserv&quot; that produced salami and cans. The company used to produce the famous brand of salami called Salam de Sibiu, for the company &quot;Theil &amp; Co. A.G. Salami und Selchwarenfabrik&quot;, located in Sibiu.

In 1921, Mediaș started to manufacture windows. The factory is now called Geromed and extended its products with blackboards, mirrors, windscreens and stained glass. In the same year, a factory now called Emailul started to produce enameled pots, mugs and dishes.

The &quot;Vitrometan&quot; factory was built in 1922 and produces various glass products, including porcelain, light bulbs and mirrors. &quot;Relee S.A&quot; manufactures automobile components, switches, wall sockets, relays and electric motors.

Mediaș is known best for its role in production of methane gas. The area where Mediaș is located is the site of the largest natural gas field in Romania. The headquarters of Romgaz - the national gas exploitation enterprise - and of Transgaz - the natural gas carrier - are in Mediaș.

== Tourism ==

Mediaș has one of the best preserved historical centers in Romania and also some well preserved medieval fortifications. One symbol of the town is the Tower of the Buglers, which is about tall. Its construction started in the 13th century. In the 15th century it was raised to 5 tiers. The St. Margaret Church was finished at about the same time. Later, 3 more tiers were added in only two months. The roof consists of colored vitrified tiles, and four turrets were built. The tower had a guard, who would sound his bugle whenever an enemy approached. The tower has in its southwestern corner (between the clocks) a small wooden man who rings a bell, thus announcing in advance when the clock will ring on the hour. The heavy pressure of the tower on the sandy soil is the reason why the tower is slightly tilted to the North. Between 1927 and 1930, and later in 1972, the tower was consolidated. The tilt of the tip compared with the base is .

The town lies in the middle of the area which was inhabited by Transylvanian Saxons and in an area of around it there are dozens of fortified churches. Two of these, Biertan and Valea Viilor, are part of the Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania UNESCO World Heritage Site.

St. Margaret&#x27;s Church: The fortified church was built in gothic style in 1488, with time it went through different modifications. The feeble ground structure made its tower, built in 1460, inclines. In 1550 the church was raised with three storeys and in 1551 four smaller towers were added to show that the city had a court. It was at that time that it attained its height. In 1783 the roof-structure was changed and the small towers renovated, it was also then that the golden globe, dating from 1550, was brought down from the tower and according to tradition its content was read aloud. The tower proved to be a good spotting post. In those times the trumpeter in the tower had an important function, sounding the alert about approaching danger. If he made a mistake, he would&#x27;ve been thrown out from the top of the tower. From this does the towers name derive, Trumpeters tower. In this tower was ordered to be locked Vlad the Impaler, a.k.a. Dracula, by King Matthias Corvinus in 1476. On the inside walls of the church one can see 14th- or 15th-century frescoes. The altar was made in 1480 in Gothic style, and portrays the sufferings of Jesus. On the portrait, below the crucified Jesus&#x27; arm, a panorama of Vienna can be observed, thereby indicating the portrait&#x27;s origin. The church walls are also decorated with eastern wall carpets given to the church by Christians, some dating back to the 16th century. In the church there is the oldest brazen baptistry in Romania, made at the beginning of the 19th century. The canopy of the pulpit was made in 1679 by master Sigismund Moess. Its pipe-organ, from 1755, is appropriate for symphony concerts. While those concerts happen, the church benches are turned to face the pipe-organ.

The route of the Via Transilvanica long-distance trail passes through Mediaș.

== Wine ==

The grapes and wine leaves visible in the city&#x27;s coat of arms refer to the (once well-known) wine from Mediaș. For example, the wine is mentioned early in Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel Dracula: &quot;The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable&quot; (Jonathan Harker&#x27;s diary, May 5, on his way to the castle of the count).

<text>Andrew Paul Gilligan (born 22 November 1968) is a British policy adviser and ex-journalist. He served as a special adviser to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, having previously worked as a transport adviser to Boris Johnson both as Mayor of London and as Prime Minister. 

Until July 2019, Gilligan was senior correspondent of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and had also served as head of the Capital City Foundation at Policy Exchange. Between 2013 and 2016 he also worked as the Mayor&#x27;s cycling commissioner for London, and in 2020 he was an appointee of Central Government to TfL&#x27;s Board. He is best known for a 2003 report on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme in which he described a British government briefing paper on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction (the September Dossier) as having been &quot;transformed in the week before it was published to make it sexier&quot;. This change became widely known, in the words of newspaper headlines about the story, as being &quot;sexed up&quot;.

He was awarded Journalist of the Year in 2008 for his investigative reports on Ken Livingstone and was shortlisted for the award again in 2015 for investigations which helped cause the downfall of politician Lutfur Rahman. He has also been a nominee for the Paul Foot Award, the Orwell Prize, the British Journalism Awards and Foreign Reporter of the Year at the British Press Awards.

==Early life and education==
Gilligan was born in Teddington, London, to Catholic parents, Kevin and Ann. Kevin was formerly a Labour Party councillor in Teddington and had graduated from University College London. Andrew was educated at Grey Court School, Kingston College of Further Education and at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied history and was news editor of the student newspaper &quot;Varsity&quot;. He was also a member of Cambridge Universities Labour Club.

==Career==
In 1994, he joined the &quot;Cambridge Evening News&quot;, then in 1995 moved to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, where he became a specialist reporter on defence. In 1999, he was recruited by the editor of BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, Rod Liddle, as Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent. In May 2003, Gilligan made a broadcast in which he claimed that the British Government had &quot;sexed up&quot; a report in order to exaggerate the weapon of mass destruction capabilities of Saddam Hussein.

Gilligan resigned from the BBC in 2004, in the wake of the Hutton Inquiry surrounding the death of David Kelly, after Lord Hutton questioned the reliability of Gilligan&#x27;s evidence.

After resigning from the BBC, Gilligan was offered a job at &quot;The Spectator&quot; by its editor, Boris Johnson, who had been a key supporter of Gilligan during the Hutton Inquiry. Later that year, Gilligan joined the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;. He was named Journalist of the Year at the British Press Awards in 2008 for his work on the London Mayoral elections, described as &quot;relentless investigative journalism at its best&quot;.

Between 2007 and 2009 Gilligan presented a fortnightly programme for Press TV, the Iranian government&#x27;s English-language TV channel. Rod Liddle challenged Gilligan in July 2009 about working for an &quot;international propaganda channel run by the Iranian government&quot;. Gilligan stopped his regular show in December 2009, though he appeared twice more on the network just before the UK&#x27;s May 2010 general election. Gilligan attributed his decision to leave to the politics of Iran &quot;that was inconsistent with my opposition to Islamism. I have not worked for Press TV since.&quot;

In 2009, Gilligan became London editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. He was also a reporter for Channel 4&#x27;s investigative programme &quot;Dispatches&quot;, covering a number of issues, including Rahman and his claimed involvement with the Islamic Forum of Europe in the London borough of Tower Hamlets. He has also been a cover presenter for LBC radio.

On 22 November 2011, Gilligan criticised the Leveson Inquiry in an appearance before the House of Lords communications committee.

In January 2013, Gilligan was appointed as the Cycling Commissioner for London by the Mayor, Boris Johnson. Accusations of &quot;cronyism&quot; were made following the appointment as Gilligan was considered instrumental in toppling the Mayor&#x27;s main rival, Ken Livingstone. He helped deliver London&#x27;s first segregated cycle superhighways and was subsequently given an award by the London Cycling Campaign for his &quot;outstanding contribution to cycling.&quot; In August 2016, Gilligan was part of a wave of redundancies at &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;; he joined &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; immediately afterwards. In 2019, he was appointed transport adviser by the then Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, based in the Downing Street policy unit. In July 2020, Grant Shapps, Transport Secretary, appointed Gilligan to TfL&#x27;s Board as one of two Special Representative attendees.

Gilligan was appointed as a special adviser to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in March 2023. He was reportedly instrumental in persuading Sunak to abandon the proposed northern leg of the High Speed 2 railway infrastructure project.

==Controversy==
In May 2016, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; apologised and paid substantial damages as part of an out-of-court settlement for defamation due to false claims made by Gilligan in a series of articles alleging corruption surrounding the purchase of Poplar Town Hall by businessman Mujibul Islam from Tower Hamlets Council when Rahman was mayor.

In May 2018, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; paid &quot;substantial damages&quot; to settle a defamation case brought against it by Mohammed Kozbar in relation to an article by Gilligan in March 2016. Gilligan had accused Kozbar of supporting Palestinian violence against Israel&#x27;s occupation. Gilligan tweeted that he stood by what he wrote.

In January 2019, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was required to publish a correction by the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which ruled that an article in July 2018 by Gilligan about laws regarding transgender people had been &quot;misleading&quot;.

<doc id="446699" wikidata="Q7817236" url="?curid=446699" title="Tom Pickard">
<text>Tom Pickard (born 1946, Newcastle upon Tyne, England) is a poet, and documentary film maker who was an important initiator of the movement known as the British Poetry Revival.

==Biography==
Born Thomas McKenna, he was raised by his mother&#x27;s maternal aunt, Catherine McKenna Pickard (1898-1990) Tom Pickard grew up in the working-class suburbs of Cowgate, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Blakelaw and left school at the age of 14. Three years later he met Basil Bunting and was instrumental in the older poet&#x27;s return to writing in the early 1960s, leading to the latter&#x27;s most acclaimed poem, the long, autobiographical &quot;Briggflatts&quot;, published in 1966. The association also produced Bunting&#x27;s scathing &quot;What the Chairman told Tom&quot; (&quot;I want to wash when I meet a poet... my twelve-year-old can do it - AND rhyme!&quot;)

In 1963, with his first wife Connie, Pickard founded and ran the Morden Tower Book Room, where he organised a series of readings by British and American modernist tradition poets, including Bunting. He also set up the Ultima Thule Bookshop - specialising in poetry, music and alternative counter-culture publications - between 1969 and 1973. During this period he also travelled in the United States to give performances and renew friendships with some of the American Morden Tower readers, including Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley and Ed Dorn. Allen Ginsberg said of him: &quot;I am an old admirer of Tom Pickard&#x27;s poetry and believe as does Basil Bunting that he is one of the most live and true poetic voices in Great Britain.&quot;

With his wife Connie he organised a benefit to find love during a long weekend in Newcastle in 1972 for the miners during their first strike since 1926. Performers at the event included the poets Christopher Logue, Hamish Henderson, Tony Harrison, Eric Mottram, Jeff Nuttall, Barry MacSweeney, Andrew Wylie, Victor Bockris, Jon Silkin and singers Paul Jones, Alan Hull and Alex Glasgow. The Boldon Colliery brass band also played at the event.

In 1974, his television play &quot;Squire&quot; was broadcast by the BBC and starred his friend, the singer songwriter Alan Hull—who wrote music for the play. The two friends also worked together on Pickard&#x27;s BBC radio documentary, &quot;The Jarrow March&quot; (1976).

Unable to find work in the North-East, Pickard moved to London in 1973 and started writing and directing radio and documentary film scripts. His film credits include &quot;We Make Ships&quot; (1988), Channel 4; &quot;Tell Them in Gdansk&quot; (1989), Channel 4 - &quot;The end of shipbuilding on the River Wear was announced in December 1988, but many shipyard workers refused to give up the fight. This film centres on a party held for the redundant shop stewards and their families and combines the music of the Flying Pickets and the humour of comedian Mike Elliott to illustrate the ironies of the closure. The title highlights Mrs Thatcher&#x27;s support for the striking shipyard workers in Gdańsk while shutting down UK yards; &quot;Birmingham Is What I Think With&quot; (1991), Arts Council England--about the poet Roy Fisher; &quot;The Shadow and the Substance&quot; (1994), Channel 4. &quot;The Shadow and the Substance&quot; (the title is a quote from John Clare’s poem on enclosure) examined the nature of work in an increasingly high-tech environment. In the film Rosemary Cramp, Emeritus Professor of Archaeology at Durham, discusses the basic human need and dignity in &quot;labour&quot; in prehistoric times as do redundant shipyard workers from Sunderland and Tyneside. This was contrasted with the &quot;psychic need&quot; to work as seen by the Adam Smith Institute justifying the paying of slave labour wages. It also featured the Bishop of Durham, David Jenkins, on the morality of the poor stealing food. The Durham Miners’ Gala featured Tony Benn speaking about privatisation eroding morality and citizenship. Young women working at a new Fujitsu semiconductor plant situated in a former mining area are asked if they feel secure in their jobs. This was to be the future, replacing mining and heavy industry. Their manager admits &quot;humans contaminate the product&quot;. (The factory later closed with a loss of 600 jobs during Tony Blair’s premiership.) The film concludes with a visit to the philosopher Andre Gorz who predicts the collapse of &quot;work&quot; and posits a radical alternative for trade unionist and socialists.

Pickard was series editor and director of film inserts on &quot;Word Of Mouth&quot;, a series of ten 30-minute TV programs for Border TV/Arts Council England. &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; won a gold medal in 1990, at the New York International Film And TV Festival, for the best performing arts series, and was a runner-up for a Royal Television Society award.

In London he collaborated with Moira Kelly of Air Gallery to run an international poetry series (which later transferred to the Riverside Studios under David Gotthard), as well as running a book-stall in Camden Lock market.

From 1976 to 1981 Pickard lived most of the time in Warsaw with his Polish wife and witnessed the rise of the Solidarność movement.

Pickard&#x27;s poetry owes much to his reading of Bunting, the Objectivist poets and of the Black Mountain poets, but is also rooted in his own urban working-class Tyneside background. His publications include &quot;High on the Walls&quot; (1968), &quot;The Order of Chance&quot; (1971), &quot;Hero Dust: New and Selected Poems&quot; (1979), &quot;Tiepin Eros: New and Selected Poems&quot; (1994), &quot;fuckwind&quot; (1999) &quot;Hole in the Wall: New and Selected Poems&quot; (2002), &quot;The Dark Months of May&quot; (2004) and &quot;Ballad of Jamie Allan&quot; (2007); the last three published in Chicago by Flood Editions. &quot;Ballad of Jamie Allan&quot; was a finalist for the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award. His part-autobiographical &quot;More Pricks Than Prizes&quot; was published in Boston by Pressed Wafer in 2010. His poem sequence &quot;Lark and Merlin&quot;, published in &quot;Poetry&quot; in 2010, won the Bess Hokin Prize in 2011.

In 2004 Pickard was commissioned by Sage Gateshead and Folkworks to write a libretto, &quot;Ballad of Jamie Allan&quot;, for the composer John Harle. The opera was premiered in 2005. A CD of &quot;Ballad of Jamie Allan&quot; (with Omar Ebrahim, Sarah Jane Morris, Kathryn Tickell, Bill Paterson, the Northern Sinfonia with Steve Lodder and Neil MacColl).

Pickard collaborated with John Harle again in 2009, writing the words for &quot;A Song for London Bridge&quot;, a piece for saxophone and choir and organ. It had its premiere on 22 June at Southwark Cathedral with Harle on saxophone, the King&#x27;s College Choir, Cambridge, conducted by Stephen Cleobury and with the organ played by David Goode.

Pickard has worked throughout his career with many musicians, including Alan Hull (of Lindisfarne), Peter Kirtley and Liane Carroll, Jed Grimes, Ben Murray and—Rosie Doonan and the folk band Tarras among others. Pickard worked with Paul McCartney editing his long poem, &quot;Standing Stone&quot;. McCartney said of Pickard&#x27;s &quot;Fuckwind&quot; (Etruscan Books 1999): &quot;This collection of poems and songs soars over the fells, screetching truth, sex, humour, anger and love. With sharp vision Tom dissects his gut reaction and reminds us to appreciate the cool clear beauty of our own situation.&quot; The singer Annie Lennox praised his collection &quot;Dark Month&#x27;s of May&quot; (Flood Editions 2004).

His work has appeared in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; and in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Dodgem Logic&quot;.

In August 2015, Pickard was one of 20 authors of &quot;Poets for Corbyn&quot;, an anthology of poems endorsing Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

<text>The Amerikabomber () project was an initiative of the German Ministry of Aviation (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot;) to obtain a long-range strategic bomber for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; that would be capable of striking the United States (specifically New York City) from Germany, a round-trip distance of about . The concept was raised as early as 1938, but advanced plans for such a long-range strategic bomber design were not presented to &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring until early 1942. Various proposals were put forward, but these plans were all eventually abandoned as they were too expensive, too reliant on rapidly diminishing materiel and production capacity, and/or technically infeasible.

==Background==
According to Albert Speer&#x27;s book, &quot;&quot;, Adolf Hitler was fascinated with the idea of New York City in flames. In 1937, Willy Messerschmitt hoped to win a lucrative contract by showing Hitler a prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 264 that was being designed to reach North America from Europe. On 8 July 1938, barely two years after the death of Germany&#x27;s main strategic bombing advocate, &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Walter Wever, and eight months after the Reich Air Ministry awarded the contract for the design of the Heinkel He 177, Germany&#x27;s only operational heavy bomber during the war years, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s commander-in-chief Hermann Göring gave a speech saying, &quot;I completely lack the bombers capable of round-trip flights to New York with a 4.5-tonne bomb load. I would be extremely happy to possess such a bomber, which would at last stuff the mouth of arrogance across the sea.&quot; Canadian historian Holger H. Herwig claims the plan started as a result of discussions by Hitler in November 1940 and May 1941 when he stated his need to &quot;deploy long-range bombers against American cities from the Azores.&quot; Due to their location, he thought the Portuguese Azores islands were Germany&#x27;s &quot;only possibility of carrying out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States.&quot; At the time, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar had allowed German U-boats and navy ships to refuel there, but from 1943 onwards, he leased bases in the Azores to the British, allowing the Allies to provide aerial coverage in the middle of the Atlantic.

Requests for designs, at various stages during the war, were made to the major German aircraft manufacturers (Messerschmitt, Junkers, Focke-Wulf and the Horten Brothers) early in World War II, coinciding with the passage of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom in September 1940. Heinkel&#x27;s bid for the project had occurred sometime shortly after February 1943, by which time the RLM had issued the Heinkel firm the airframe type number &quot;8-277&quot; for what essentially became its entry.

== Plan ==
The &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project plan was completed on April 27, 1942, and submitted to &quot;Reichsmarschall&quot; Hermann Göring on May 12, 1942. The 33-page plan was discovered in Potsdam by , a German historian. Ten copies of the plan were made, with six going to different Luftwaffe offices and four held in reserve. The plan specifically mentions using the Azores as a transit airfield to reach the United States. If utilized, the Heinkel He 277, Junkers Ju 390, and the Messerschmitt Me 264 could reach American targets with a 3 tonne, 5 tonne, and 6.5 tonne payload respectively. Although it is apparent that the plan itself deals only with an attack on American soil, it is possible the Nazis saw other interrelated strategic purposes for the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project. According to military historian James P. Duffy, Hitler &quot;saw in the Azores the ... possibility for carrying out aerial attacks from a land base against the United States ... [which in turn would] force it to build up a large antiaircraft defense.&quot; The anticipated result would have been to force the United States to use more of its antiaircraft capabilities—guns and fighter planes—for its own defense rather than for that of Great Britain, thereby allowing the Luftwaffe to attack the latter country with less resistance.

Partly as a liaison with the &quot;Wehrmacht Heer&quot;, in May 1942 &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erhard Milch requested the opinion of &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz on the new proposal, with regard to the aircraft available to fill the needs of an &quot;Amerikabomber&quot;, which had then included the Me 264, Fw 300 and the Ju 290. von Gablenz gave his opinion on the Me 264, as it was in the second half of 1942, before von Gablenz&#x27;s own commitments in the Battle of Stalingrad occurred: the Me 264 could not be usefully equipped for a true trans-Atlantic bomber mission from Europe, but it would be useful for a number of very long-range maritime patrol duties in co-operation with the &quot;Kriegsmarine&#x27;s&quot; U-boats off the US East Coast.

==Design==

===Conventional bombers===
The most promising proposals were based on conventional principles of aircraft design, and would have yielded aircraft very similar in configuration and capability to the Allied heavy bombers of the day. These would have needed ultra-long range capability similar to the Messerschmitt Me 261 maritime reconnaissance design, the longest-ranged intended design actually flown during the Third Reich&#x27;s existence. Many of the developed designs, themselves first submitted during 1943 suggested tricycle landing gear for their undercarriage, a relatively new feature for large German military aircraft designs of that era. These included the following concepts:

* Messerschmitt Me 264 (an all-new design, and the first one built and flown, submitted in May 1942),
* Focke-Wulf Ta 400,
* Junkers Ju 390 (based on the Ju 290, the second and last built and flown, with the Ju 290 itself submitted in May 1942), 
* Heinkel He 277 (as it underwent ongoing engineering development through 1943, itself first specified by its RLM airframe number by February 1943).

Three prototypes of the Me 264 were built, but it was the Ju 390 that was selected for production. A verified pair of the Ju 390 design were constructed before the program was abandoned. After World War II, several authors claimed that the second Ju 390 actually made a transatlantic flight, coming within 20 km (12 mi) of the northeast U.S. coast in early 1944, but this claim has since been discredited as Ju 390 V2 never flew. As both the Me 264 and He 277 were each intended to be four-engined bombers from their origins, the troubling situation of being unable to develop combat-reliable piston aviation engines of 1,500 kW (2,000 PS) and above output levels led to both designs being considered for six-engined upgrades, with Messerschmitt&#x27;s paper project for a 47.5 meter wingspan &quot;Me 264B&quot; airframe upgrade to use six BMW 801E radials, and the Heinkel firm&#x27;s July 23, 1943-dated request from the RLM to propose a 45-meter wingspan, six-engined variant of the still-unfinalized He 277 airframe design that could alternatively accommodate four of the troublesome, over-1,500 kW output apiece Junkers Jumo 222 24-cylinder six-bank liquid-cooled engines, or two additional BMW 801E radials beyond the four it was originally meant to use. July 23, 1943, was the same day that the USAAF submitted a &quot;letter of intent&quot; to Convair, that ordered the first 100 production Convair B-36 bombers to be built - itself a design first asked for by the earlier USAAC on April 11, 1941 - an enormous six-engined, 70-meter wingspan design far superior to either the Heinkel He 277 or Focke-Wulf Ta 400 designs.

===&quot;Huckepack Projekt&quot; (Piggyback Project)===
One idea similar to Mistel-Gespann was to have a Heinkel He 177 bomber carry a Dornier Do 217, powered with an additional &quot;Lorin-Staustrahltriebwerk&quot; (Lorin-ramjet), as far as possible over the Atlantic before releasing it. For the Do 217 it would have been a one-way trip. The aircraft would be ditched off the east coast, and its crew would be picked up by a waiting U-boat. When plans had advanced far enough, the lack of fuel and the loss of the base at Bordeaux prevented a test. The project was abandoned after the forced move to Istres increased the distance too much.

The Huckepack Projekt was brought up again at multiple joint conferences between the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. After a few weeks the plan was abandoned on August 21, 1942. Air Staff General Kreipe wrote in his diary that the German navy could not supply a U-boat off the United States to pick up the aircrew. The plan saw no further development, since the Kriegsmarine would not cooperate with the Luftwaffe.

===Other designs===
Other designs were rockets with wings. Perhaps the best-known of these today is Eugen Sänger&#x27;s pre-war &quot;Silbervogel (&quot;Silverbird&quot;)&quot; sub-orbital bomber.

==Potential targets==
Included in the plan was a list of 21 targets of military importance in North America. Many of these would not have been viable targets for conventional bombers of World War II, operating from bases in Europe. Of these targets, primarily but not exclusively located in the eastern United States, 19 were located in the United States; one in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (a possibly achievable target for a similar Japanese project) and one in Greenland. Nearly all were companies that manufactured parts for aircraft, so the goal was likely to cripple U.S. aircraft production.

==Feasibility and consequences==

Were New York City to be bombed, the required combat radius was , as the bomber would have needed to make a return trip without refueling. The only German aircraft already built and flown that had a range close to this was the Messerschmitt Me 261 &quot;Adolfine&quot;, with a maximum range of .

Had sufficient time and resources been devoted to the project at a point in time early enough, an &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; may have become operational before the war&#x27;s end. However, as historian James P. Duffy pointed out, Nazi Germany had no central authority for the development and construction of advanced weaponry, including new aircraft concepts and designs, as well as critical problems in developing high-powered aviation engines – that is, with output of over each, which could operate reliably in combat conditions – that would have been required. Hitler was often swayed to waste time, money and resources on new &quot;miracle weapons&quot; and other projects that were unlikely to be successful. The &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project was not one of the projects so favored. In addition, Allied bombing became so intense during the middle of the war that it disrupted critical German supply chains, particularly fuel; in addition, ever-greater proportions of resources were reserved for home defense purposes. German scientists were forced more and more to compete for ever scarcer resources. Together, all of the above political and strategic constraints made construction of such an aircraft increasingly less likely.

It was unlikely that any damage caused to targets in North America, by the relatively small conventional bomb loads that could be delivered by such an ultra-long-range bomber, would be significant enough to justify the loss of such a bomber. Nazi Germany&#x27;s nuclear programme was years behind the Allies, and did not include weapons in the form of aerial bombs, so it was unlikely that the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; could have made a major difference to the outcome of the war.

Ultimately, all of the aircraft designs under consideration were deemed too expensive and/or ambitious and were abandoned. Post-war, however, they continued to be of interest to aerospace engineers:
* the British Air Ministry considered development of the Horten H.XVIII as an airliner, and;
* the theoretical groundwork done on the Sänger &quot;Silbervogel&quot; would prove seminal to lifting body designs in the space age – one of the designs for the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; would use a concept similar to a space shuttle.

<text>John Shore (c. 1662 – 1752) was an English trumpeter and lutenist. He invented the tuning fork in 1711. Shore came from a family of musicians including the singer Catherine Shore. He was Sergeant Trumpeter to the court. He is credited with demonstrating that the trumpet, which up till then had been a military instrument, could be used in an orchestral role. Shore had parts specifically written for him by both George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell.

Over time, tuning forks were adapted for use in medical and therapeutic settings, where their precise frequencies have been harnessed for healing and therapeutic purposes.

Tuning forks are known for their nearly pure frequency response, emitting a clear, unwavering tone that is free from the complex overtones found in other instruments. This purity of sound makes them ideal for applications where specific frequencies need to be isolated and targeted.

<doc id="446704" wikidata="Q5003999" url="?curid=446704" title="Bydgoszcz–Toruń metropolitan area">
<text>Bydgoszcz–Toruń metropolitan area (Polish: &quot;bydgosko-toruński obszar metropolitalny&quot;) is the name of the bi-polar metropolitan area in the middle of the Vistula river centered on the cities of Bydgoszcz and Toruń in north-central Poland. The distance between the built-up areas of the cities is about 30 km. They are the administrative capitals and economic centers of Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Despite the fact that these two cities are integrating gradually, they have been in a great competition through the centuries. In September 2004 the Medical Academy in Bydgoszcz joined Toruń University as Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz. Although not without some controversy, this is usually considered as an important step in the integration process.

Depending on the calculation method and on what is the exact area taken into consideration, the total population varies from between about 600,000 and 800,000 inhabitants.

==Population==
The total population of the two biggest cities combined (Bydgoszcz + Toruń), excluding adjacent communities:
* 1900: 81,839 inhabitants (52,204 + 29,635)
* 1910: 103,923 inhabitants (57,696 + 46,227)
* 1920: 121,354 inhabitants (84,054 + 37,300)
* 1931: 171,808 inhabitants (117,528 + 54,280)
* 1939: 224,275 inhabitants (143,075 + 81,200)
* 1946: 202,699 inhabitants (134,614 + 68,085)
* 1950: 243,161 inhabitants (162,524 + 80,637)
* 1955: 294,594 inhabitants (202,044 + 92,550)
* 1960: 336,913 inhabitants (232,007 + 104,906)
* 1995: 590,716 inhabitants (386,056 + 204,660)
* 2020: 545,197 inhabitants (344,091 + 201,106)

==History==

Historically, Bydgoszcz and Toruń were the most important royal cities in the area. Both cities hosted sessions of the Polish Parliament, i.e. Bydgoszcz in 1520, and Toruń in 1576 and 1626. It is also where Peaces of Thorn and Treaty of Bromberg were signed. The two were parts of different administrative units for centuries, with Bydgoszcz starting as Polish and Toruń as Teutonic settlements, then becoming the biggest cities of Inowrocław Voivodeship and Chełmno Voivodeship in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, later in Germany of Bromberg district (Province of Posen) and Marienwerder district (West Prussia).

This would change only in the year of 1938, when Bydgoszcz was moved from the Poznań to the Pomeranian Voivodeship with Toruń, soon to take the role of the capital of the whole region.

The postwar growth of the cities and the new political administrative landscape led to application of the term &quot;Bydgoszcz-Toruń metropolitan area&quot; which first appeared in the 1960s.

==Education==
* Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń
* Casimir the Great University in Bydgoszcz
* Bydgoszcz University of Science and Technology
* Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz of the Nicolaus Copernicus University
* Feliks Nowowiejski Music Academy, Bydgoszcz
* Jagiellonian College, Toruń

==Sights==

The main sights of the agglomeration are the old towns of Bydgoszcz and Toruń, with the latter listed as a World Heritage Site. The local spa town is Ciechocinek, and its graduation towers, saline and spa parks are declared a Historic Monument of Poland.

The metropolitan area is rich in historic architecture ranging from Romanesque and Gothic architecture to Renaissance, Baroque and Art Nouveau. There are also several castles and palaces, including Dybów, Zamek Bierzgłowski, Ostromecko, Żołędowo. The Dybów Castle was the place where in 1454 King Casimir IV Jagiellon issued the famous Statutes of Nieszawa, covering a set of privileges for the Polish nobility; an event that is regarded as the birth of the noble democracy in Poland, which lasted until the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland.

Bydgoszcz and Toruń host major museums and art galleries, including the Leon Wyczółkowski Regional Museum in Bydgoszcz and District Museum in Toruń. The more unique museums include:
*Copernicus House in Toruń, museum dedicated to Nicolaus Copernicus
*European Museum of Money at the former Polish Royal Mint in Bydgoszcz
*Museum of Toruń Gingerbread in Toruń
*Museum of Far Eastern Art in the Under the Star Tenement House in Toruń
*Andrzej Szwalbe Collection of Historical Pianos at the palace in Ostromecko, one of two largest such collections in Poland
*Exploseum in Bydgoszcz, operated at the site of a former Nazi German arms factory.

==Sports==
Motorcycle speedway, basketball and volleyball enjoy the largest following in the metropolitan area. The KS Toruń and Polonia Bydgoszcz clubs are among the most accomplished speedway clubs in the country and contest the Pomeranian-Kuyavian Derby, one of the fiercest speedway rivalries.

<text>Åge Fridtjof Hareide (born 23 September 1953) is a Norwegian former football coach and player who last managed the Iceland national team. In his playing career, he played for Hødd and Molde in Norway as well as Manchester City and Norwich City in England. Hareide was capped 50 times playing for Norway.

As a coach, Hareide has won league titles in all of the Scandinavian countries, In Sweden with Helsingborgs IF in 1999 and with Malmö FF in 2014, in Denmark with Brøndby in 2001–02 and in his native Norway with Rosenborg in 2003. Hareide was in charge of the Norway national team from 2003 to 2008. While at Malmö during his first time in charge at the club, he notably took the team to the modern-day UEFA Champions League group stages for the first two times in the club&#x27;s history. He coached Denmark to a round of 16 finish at the 2018 FIFA World Cup before appointed coach of Iceland in 2023. Following his time with Iceland, he announced his retirement from coaching.

==Playing career==
During his playing career, Hareide played for Hødd, Molde, Manchester City and Norwich City.

He was also an active player for the Norway national team from 1976 through 1986, scoring five goals in 50 matches.

==Coaching career==
As a coach Hareide has won three European countries&#x27; national league championships, namely that of Denmark, Sweden and his native Norway, making him the only coach to have won the league in three Scandinavian countries. Other coaches who have won league titles in three countries include fellow Scandinavians Trond Sollied and Sven-Göran Eriksson, while Ernst Happel, Giovanni Trapattoni, José Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti have won championships in four countries.

===Early managerial career===
In the mid-1990s, Norwegian millionaires Kjell Inge Røkke and Bjørn Rune Gjelsten were reportedly interested in bringing Hareide back to Manchester City as manager if their bid to take over the club was successful, but the takeover bid failed and Hareide never returned to the club. When the pair tried to take over Leeds United around the same time, it was once again reported that Hareide would be installed as manager if the takeover bid succeeded, but this bid too failed and Hareide was never put in charge at Elland Road. However, the pair finally succeeded in a takeover bid for fellow English Premier League club Wimbledon in June 1997, and Hareide appeared all set to become the new manager of the club in a move that would have ousted the incumbent Joe Kinnear. But this never happened either.

===Norway===
Hareide was employed as the coach of the Norway national football team at the end of 2003, replacing Nils Johan Semb, after one season as coach of Rosenborg BK. On 8 December 2008, after having failed to take Norway to any international tournaments, and having had a bad start to the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, Hareide resigned from his position as national team coach of Norway. On 9 December 2008 Hareide announced that he was stepping down as coach of the Norway national team.

===Viking===
On 10 June 2009 it was announced that he wouldbe coaching Örgryte IS. On 1 December 2009 the former Norway national team head coach left the Swedish club to join Viking FK, from Stavanger to replace Uwe Rösler. Following Egil Østenstad resignation as director of football in Viking, Viking announced in September 2011 that Hareide would be manager of Viking, and that Josep Clotet Ruiz would be hired as coach from the 2012-season onwards, similar to the organization English clubs and Molde have, with Ole Gunnar Solskjær as manager and Mark Dempsey as coach. Viking finished 9th in 2010, Hareide&#x27;s first season, and 11th in 2011. With the team positioned on 10th place on 9 June 2012, Hareide was released by Viking FK because of the bad results.

===Second spell at Helsingborg===
Following Conny Karlsson&#x27;s resignation in Helsingborgs IF, the club hired Hareide, the last coach who won Allsvenskan with Helsingborgs IF, except Karlsson, as head coach until the end of the 2012 season.

===Malmö FF===
Hareide was brought out of retirement from his managerial career by being appointed as the new manager of the reigning Swedish champions Malmö FF on 9 January 2014. He had immediate success at the club as he led the team to defend their Allsvenskan title and qualify for the group stage of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League in his first season. For this successful season Hareide was awarded Allsvenskan manager of the year. He was also nominated for coach of the year at Svenska idrottsgalan.

===Denmark===
On 10 December 2015, Hareide was announced as the new manager of the Denmark national football team replacing Morten Olsen, who had stepped down following the UEFA Euro 2016 qualification. Hareide began his new job on 1 March 2016. In November 2017, he managed his Denmark team to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. This was achieved with a 5-1 aggregate play-off win over Ireland.

Hareide was the Danish coach at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He managed Denmark to 2nd place in their group before they were eliminated in the round of 16 in a penalty shootout against Croatia.

Hareide continued as manager of in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. Under his leadership Denmark qualified for the UEFA Euro 2020. It was revealed that Kasper Hjulmand would replace him as manager of the Danish team following the tournament. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was postponed, and Hareide&#x27;s contract expired. When he left he had not lost in ordinary time for the last 34 games, and his last defeat was on 11 October 2016 against Montenegro.

===Rosenborg===
In August 2020, he became the head coach of Rosenborg BK for a second tenure.

===Malmö FF===
In September 2022, Åge was announced as the new interim manager for Malmö FF.

===Iceland===
On 14 April 2023, Åge was announced as the new manager of the Iceland national football team. He resigned from his position on 25 November 2024. A day later, he announced his retirement from coaching.

==Media career==
He resigned as the Norway national team coach then worked as an expert Norwegian Premier League commentator for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation.

<doc id="446706" wikidata="Q315658" url="?curid=446706" title="University of Wrocław">
<text>The University of Wrocław (, UWr; ) is a public research university in Wrocław, Poland. It is the largest institution of higher learning in the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, with over 100,000 graduates since 1945, including some 1,900 researchers, among whom many have received the highest awards for their contributions to the development of scientific scholarship. 

The university was reconstituted in its current form in 1945, as a direct successor to the previous German University of Breslau. Following the territorial changes of Poland&#x27;s borders, academics primarily from the Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów restored the university building, which had been heavily damaged in the 1945 Battle of Breslau.

== History ==
===Leopoldina===
The oldest mention of a university in Wrocław comes from the foundation deed signed on 20 July 1505 for the &quot;Generale litterarum Gymnasium&quot; in Wrocław by King Vladislaus II of Hungary () of the Polish Jagiellonian dynasty. However, the new academic institution requested by the town council was not built, because the King&#x27;s deed was rejected by Pope Julius II for political reasons. Also, the numerous wars and opposition from the University of Kraków might have played a role. The first successful founding deed known as the &quot;Aurea bulla fundationis Universitatis Wratislaviensis&quot; was signed two centuries later, on 1 October 1702, by the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I of the House of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia.

The predecessor facilities, which existed since 1638, were converted into Jesuit school, and finally, upon instigation of the Jesuits and with the support of the Silesian Oberamtsrat (Second Secretary) Johannes Adrian von Plencken, donated as a university in 1702 by Emperor Leopold I as a School of Philosophy and Catholic Theology with the designated name Leopoldina. On 15 November 1702, the university opened. Johannes Adrian von Plencken also became chancellor of the university. As a Catholic institute in Protestant Breslau, the new university was an important instrument of the Counter-Reformation in Silesia. After Silesia passed to Prussia, the university lost its ideological character, but remained a religious institution for the education of Catholic clergy in Prussia.

===Silesian Friedrich Wilhelm University in Breslau===
After the defeat of Prussia by Napoleon and the subsequent reorganisation of the Prussian state, the academy was merged on 3 August 1811 with the Protestant Viadrina University, previously located in Frankfurt (Oder), and re-established in Breslau as the Königliche Universität zu Breslau – Universitas litterarum Vratislaviensis (in 1911 named the Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität zu Breslau, to honour the founder Frederick William III of Prussia). At first, the conjoint academy had five faculties: philosophy, medicine, law, Protestant theology, and Catholic theology.

Connected with the university were three theological seminars, a philological seminar, a seminar for German Philology, another seminar for Romanic and English philology, an historical seminar, a mathematical-physical one, a legal state seminar, and a scientific seminar. From 1842, the university also had a chair of Slavic Studies. The university had twelve different scientific institutes, six clinical centers, and three collections. An agricultural institute with ten teachers and forty-four students, comprising a chemical veterinary institute, a veterinary institute, and a technological institute, was added to the university in 1881. In 1884, the university had 1,481 students in attendance, with a faculty numbering 131.
The library in 1885 consisted of approximately 400,000 works, including about 2,400 incunabula, approximately 250 Aldines, and 2,840 manuscripts. These volumes came from the libraries of the former universities of Frankfurt and Breslau and from disestablished monasteries, and also included the oriental collections of the Bibliotheca Habichtiana and the academic &quot;Leseinstitut&quot;.

In addition, the university owned an observatory; a five-hectare botanical garden; a botanical museum and a zoological garden founded in 1862 by a joint-stock company; a natural history museum; zoological, chemical, and physical collections; the chemical laboratory; the physiological plant; a mineralogical institute; an anatomical institute; clinical laboratories; a gallery (mostly from churches, monasteries, etc.) full of old German works; the museum of Silesian antiquities; and the state archives of Silesia.

In the late 19th century, numerous internationally renowned and historically notable scholars lectured at the University of Breslau, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Ferdinand Cohn, and Gustav Kirchhoff among them.
In 1817, Poles made up around 16% of the student body. At the end of the 19th century around 10% of the students were Polish and 16% were Jewish. This situation reflected the multi ethnic and international character of the university. Both minorities, as well as the German students, established their own student organisations, called &quot;Burschenschaften&quot;. 
Polish student organisations included Concordia, Polonia, and a branch of the Sokol association. Many of the students came from other areas of partitioned Poland. The Jewish students unions were the Viadrina (founded 1886) and the Student Union (1899). &quot;Teutonia&quot;, a German Burschenschaft founded in 1817, was actually one of the oldest student fraternities in Germany, founded only two years after the Urburschenschaft. The Polish fraternities were all eventually disbanded by the German professor Felix Dahn, and in 1913 Prussian authorities established a numerus clausus law that limited the number of Jews from non-German Eastern Europe (so called &quot;Ostjuden&quot;) that could study in Germany to at most 900. The University of Breslau was allowed to take 100.
As Germany turned to Nazism, the university became influenced by Nazi ideology. Polish students were beaten by NSDAP members just for speaking Polish. In 1939, all Polish students were expelled and an official university declaration stated, &quot;We are deeply convinced that [another] Polish foot will never cross the threshold of this German university&quot;. In that same year, German scholars from the university worked on a scholarly thesis of historical justification for a &quot;plan of mass deportation in Eastern territories&quot;; among the people involved was Walter Kuhn, a specialist of Ostforschung. Other projects during World War II involved creating evidence to justify German annexation of Polish territories, and presenting Kraków and Lublin as German cities.

In January 2015, the university restored 262 PhD degrees stripped during the Nazi period from Jews and other scholars seen as hostile to the Nazis.

===University of Wrocław===

After the Siege of Breslau, the Red Army took the city in May 1945. Breslau, now known as Wrocław, became part of the Republic of Poland. The first Polish team of academics arrived in Wrocław in late May 1945 and took custody of the university buildings, which were 70% destroyed. Parts of the collection of the university library perished during the Soviet offensive in 1945, burned by soldiers on 10 May 1945, four days after the German garrison surrendered the city.

Very quickly, some buildings were repaired, and a cadre of professors was built up, many coming from prewar Polish Jan Kazimierz University of Lwów and Stefan Batory University of Wilno. Following postwar border shifts, thousands of former employees of the Lwów Library, the Jan Kazimierz University and Ossoliński National Institute moved to the city. In mid-1948, over 60% of professors at the Wrocław University and Polytechnic were from Kresy, with academics from prewar Lwów playing a particularly important role in the newly established Polish institutions of higher learning. Stanisław Kulczyński from the University of Lwów was nominated the first president of the two Polish universities in Wrocław, while Edward Sucharda from the Lwów Polytechnic became the vice-president.

The University of Wrocław was refounded as a Polish state university by the decree of the State National Council issued on 24 August 1945. The first lecture was given on 15 November 1945, by Ludwik Hirszfeld. Between 1952 and 1989 the university was named Bolesław Bierut University of Wrocław (Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Wrocławski im. Bolesława Bieruta&quot;) after Bolesław Bierut, President of the Republic of Poland (1947–52).

In 2015, nearly 80 years after the fact, the university restored academic degrees stripped from German Jews by the Nazis owing to German anti-Semitism. &quot;Wroclaw University estimates that in total some 262 people suffered a similar fate.&quot;

<text>Paraty (or Parati, ) is a preserved Portuguese colonial (1500–1822) and Brazilian Imperial (1822–1889) municipality with a population of about 43,000. The name &quot;Paraty&quot; originates from the local Guaianá Indians&#x27; indigenous Tupi language, named for an abundant local fish native to the region. Paraty is located on the Costa Verde (Green Coast), a lush green corridor that runs along the coastline of the state of Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. Paraty has become a tourist destination, known for its historic town center and the coast and mountains in the region. The historic center of the city, as well as four areas of the Atlantic Forest, were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2019 under the title &quot;Paraty and Ilha Grande&quot;.

== Geography ==
The town is located on the Bay of Ilha Grande, which is dotted with many tropical islands. Rising as high as 1,300 meters behind the town are tropical forests, mountains, and waterfalls. It is the southernmost and westernmost city in Rio de Janeiro state.

Paraty is listed by IPHAN as a National Historic Landmark.
More than 80% of its territory is protected by conservation units:
*Cairuçu Environmental Protection Area, where the village of Trindade is located
*Tamoios Ecological Station
*Serra da Bocaina National Park
*Baia de Paraty, Paraty Mirim and Saco do Mamanguá Environmental Protection Area
*Juatinga Ecological Reserve
Nearby is the Serra do Mar State Park of São Paulo. 
The municipality also includes an indigenous village and an Afro-Brazilian &quot;quilombo&quot; settlement.

=== Climate ===
The temperature in Paraty ranges from . Its wettest month is February. However, sea breezes temper the heat and afternoon rains are common in the summer.

== Municipal symbols ==
=== Flag ===
The flag of Paraty was adopted on August 12, 1967. The overall colors of the flag represent the following traits: gold signifies strength, silver represents innocence, red is bravery, blue serenity, and green is the color of abundance.

Red, white, and blue are the three colors that have traditionally been used to decorate the historic houses of the city. The colors are displayed in three vertical stripes, with a coat of arms on the center. The large white star on the red stripe symbolizes the first district, and on the blue stripe two small stars represent the second and third districts. The three stars are placed in a triangular form, in homage to the strong presence of Freemasonry in the architecture of the city. The crown represents the royal traditions that discovered the country and founded the independent country. The real reason for green is the Portuguese house of Bragança and yellow for the Austrian house of Habsburg (Dom Pedro I and Dona Leopoldina).

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms shown on the flag was adopted on November 30, 1960. The four quarters of the coat of arms symbolize the following:

# The first green-colored quarter on the upper left-hand side with a feathered headdress above two crossed arrows, represents the original inhabitants of the region, the Guaianás tribe.
# The second quarter in red with a white oval seal with the royal Portuguese coat of arms surrounded by the word &quot;Remédios,&quot; a seal which was used in colonial times to authenticate official documents; Our Lady of Remedies has been patron saint of the town since 1646.
# The third quarter, which is white, blue and yellow is an outline of the city and the bay with a superimposed silver fish that is perhaps a reference to Tupi language origin of the city name.
# Finally the fourth quarter of blue shows the corner of a colonial house and a wrought-iron rail which is representative of the colonial-style houses that exemplify Paraty.

The flora which supports the red scroll are a branch of coffee tree and a stalk of sugarcane. The scroll itself bears the inscription “1660 Paraty 1844” These are the dates that Paraty initially achieved status as a town and then later city status. Above the shield is a crown consisting of five towers, with the center tower emblazoned with a red shield bearing a gold fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes Our Lady of Remedies, the patron saint of the city.

== History ==
The village of Paraty was founded in 1597. It was established formally as a town by Portuguese colonists in 1667, in a region populated by the Guaianás Indians.

The Guaianás people who lived where the city now stands called the entire area “Paraty”. In the Tupi language “Paraty” means “river of fish”. Even today the Brazilian Mullet (&quot;Mugil brasiliensis&quot;) still come back to spawn in the rivers that spill into the Bay of Paraty. When the region was colonized by the Portuguese, they adopted the Guaianás name for their new town.

=== The Gold Trail ===
After the discovery of the world&#x27;s richest gold mines in 1696 in the mountains of Minas Gerais, Paraty became an export port for gold to Rio de Janeiro and from there on to Portugal. The ensuing gold rush led to the construction of the &quot;Caminho do Ouro&quot; or &quot;Gold Trail&quot;, a 1200 kilometer road, paved in steep areas with large stones, which connected Paraty to Diamantina via Ouro Preto and Tiradentes. Not only was it used to transport gold to Paraty, but it was also used to convey supplies, miners and African slaves by mule train over the mountains to and from the gold mining areas. Two sections of the Caminho do Ouro have been excavated near Paraty and are now a tourist destination for hiking.

The Gold Trail fell into disuse because of attacks on the gold laden ships bound for Rio de Janeiro by pirates who frequented the islands and coves of the Bay of Angra dos Reis. Eventually a safer overland route from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro was created because of these pirate raids. Finally, the gold itself began to run out in the late 18th century, and Paraty declined.

The Gold Trail was submitted for inclusion on the World Heritage List in August 2004.

=== Economic revival ===
The city&#x27;s economic activity revived as a port for a new boom, the coffee trade of the Paraiba do Sul River Valley in the early 19th century, until a railway along the valley created cheaper transport to the port of Rio de Janeiro. Another smaller revival came late in the 19th century with the production of cachaça, which is a sugarcane-derived spirit best known today as the basis for Brazil&#x27;s most famous cocktail, the caipirinha. The name &quot;Paraty&quot; in that period became synonymous with cachaça.
Since then, Paraty has been out of the mainstream, which is why it did not change for centuries, until a paved road was built from Rio de Janeiro to Santos, near São Paulo, in the 1970s. The city then began a new cycle of activity, which transformed a small, almost abandoned town living on very limited economic activity, mainly fishing and agriculture (bananas, manioc, sugarcane) into a tourism destination. 

As of 2019, the historic town of Paraty has been listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site for its mixed cultural-natural landscape, encompassing its coastal historic center and nine natural areas.

== Architecture ==
Paraty is known for the cobblestone-paved streets throughout the Historic Center District. No cars or trucks are allowed in this part of town, only foot traffic or bicycles. Motor vehicles are only allowed in the Historic District on Wednesdays for deliveries. Horses and carts are a very common sight in Paraty and are frequently used all around the city.

Paraty has been able to maintain many of its historic buildings. Much of the architecture of the city has not changed for 250 years or more.

=== Churches ===
There are four important historic baroque churches in Paraty:

==== Chapel of Saint Rita ====
Capela de Santa Rita is the oldest church in Paraty. It was completed in 1722. This was the church of the freed slaves and freeman, former slaves. It is currently home to the Museum of Sacred Art.

==== Church of Nossa Senhora do Rosário e São Benedito ====
This church was built and used by Paraty&#x27;s African slaves. It dates back to the year 1725. The church has a much simpler, more rustic style than the other three churches in Paraty. Every year in the first week of December the festivities of São Benedito are held in this church.

==== Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Dores ====
This chapel dates back to 1800. It was used mostly by the rich women of society. Construction was overseen by the presiding priest, Father Antonio Xavier da Silva Braga. The building was later renovated in 1901. The image of Nossa Senhora da Piedade was stolen from this chapel. It was finally recovered in the 1990s, and now can be seen at the Museum of Sacred Art in the Capela de Santa Rita.

==== Church of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios ====
Igreja Matriz Nossa Senhora dos Remédios is the largest church in Paraty. It takes up over an entire city block. Its construction began in 1646 when a woman named Maria Jácome de Melo donated the land for the construction of the village of Paraty, however she demanded two conditions: The first was the building of a chapel dedicated to Nossa Senhora dos Remédios and the second was that no one would harm the Indians that lived in the area at that time. The church was completed in 1873.

==== Chapel of the Generosa ====

Additionally, there is a very small chapel called Capela da Generosa which according to legend, was constructed in 1901 by the order of a generous female patron, in memory of Teodoro. Teodoro supposedly drowned in the river Perequê-Açu when he tried to fish on Good Friday, a day on which according to tradition it was not recommended to fish.

==== Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição ====

There are also historical churches in two nearby small villages, Paraty Mirim and Penha.

Paraty-Mirim (Little Paraty) is the site of first chapel built by settlers in the region around Paraty (1686). At the time of its construction Paraty-Mirim an important commercial center and thriving village. Today however, all that remains there are the church itself and a scattering private homes. Although in recent years the tourist trade has grown there due to the pristine beaches in the area and Paraty-Mirim now has a few small inns, a couple of restaurant/bars and offers boat tours.

==== Church of Nossa Senhora da Penha ====

This church is unique in that it was built on top of a huge boulder in the small hamlet of Penha, just outside Paraty. The church is located directly across from the Tourist Information Center at the trail-head of the Caminho do Ouro.

=== Forts ===
There are two colonial forts in Paraty: Forte Defensor and Forte Patitiba.

==== Forte Defensor ====
Forte Defensor was built in 1703 and outfitted with six cannons for the protection of the city&#x27;s important commercial warehouses. With the aforementioned economic decline of the region, it was in ruins until 1822, when it was reconstructed and dedicated to Emperor Dom Pedro I. Some historians believe that it was at the fort that the first nucleus of the town began, in that the area around the fort is still referred to as the &quot;Old Village.&quot;

Ruins of the old defensive stone walls together with the cannons can still be seen today. It is also home to a powder house for storing explosives – one of the few still existing in Brazil. Forte Defensor is one of seven fortifications that were built around the harbor of Paraty, two of them being in the city. All of the others that were constructed outside the city are now only ruins.

==== Forte Patitiba [Cadeia Antiga] ====
What is left of this fort, also known as &quot;Cadeia Antiga&quot; (the Old Jail), is a smallish structure which for a while was also used as a prison. It is found in the plaza of Santa Rita, next to the church of same name. Constructed in the beginning of the 18th century, the building was part of a larger Forte Patitiba, the other blockhouse built in the city for defense of the harbor. In the 19th century it was decommissioned and today it houses the local public library.

There are also many colorful colonial houses (refurbished in most cases), many of which have been transformed into shops, &quot;pousadas&quot; (Brazilian bed-and-breakfasts), restaurants and bars.

==== Flooded Streets ====
Once a month when there is a full moon and the tide is high, seawater rises above its normal levels and pours into the Historic Center District through special openings in the seawalls that separate the city from the harbor. The streets are only flooded for a short time until the tide recedes. The water is usually only deep, and a few merchants near the seawall put out small bridges to span the flooded streets for the benefit of pedestrians.

== Neighborhoods ==

Paraty is divided into 12 neighborhoods. They are as follows:

* Caboré
* Centro Historico
* Fátima
* Ilha das Cobras
* Jabaquara
* Mangueira
* Parque Imperial
* Parque Ypê
* Patitiba
* Portal de Paraty
* Saudade
* Vila Colonial

The municipality contains the Paraty-Mirim State Park, created in 1972.
It contains part of the Tamoios Ecological Station.

== Culture and tourism ==
There are many musical and cultural events, the most prominent of which is the FLIP – Festa Literaria Internacional de Paraty (International Literary Festival of Paraty). The town is also known for its local festivals on Catholic holy dates, such as the Feast of the Holy Ghost. 

The annual Paraty Bourbon Jazz Festival has occurred every May since 2009. The traditional music event has already brought names like Stanley Jordan, Gary Brown, Ed Motta, Leo Gandelman, Eumir Deodato, Joshua Redman, Pau Brasil Group, Dianne Reaves, Mike Stern, Naná Vasconcellos, Nuno Mindelis, Jacques Morelenbaum, Stanley Clarke, and many other leading names in jazz, blues, soul and R &amp; B from Brazil and the world. 

The event usually has two stages, located in the Plaza de Matriz and the Santa Rita Church in the historic center of the city, as well as buskers (street performers) and Orleans Street Jazz Band circling the streets of the Historic Center and DJ Crizz that opens and closes programming every day. 

The &quot;Casa da Cultura Paraty&quot; (Paraty House of Culture) occupies an historic house originally built in 1754 which opened to the public in 2004 and holds a permanent exhibition on local history and culture. In the Salon of Indigenous Culture, visitors can see the “carpets” made of colored sawdust and flower petals used during the festival of Corpus Christi in June. The largest is almost . The “carpet” is protected by glass so that visitors walk on it as they enter.

Paraty played the part of the Bahian town of Ilhéus in the 1983 Bruno Barreto film &quot;Gabriela, Cravo e Canela&quot;, starring Sônia Braga and Marcello Mastroianni.

Paraty was also the set for Isle Esme (the place of Edward and Bella&#x27;s honeymoon) in the movie &quot;The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn&quot;.

== Transportation ==

Paraty airport can be reached from Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo by chartered helicopter or small commercial and private aircraft because presently it has no scheduled flights.

Another possibility of transport is to arrive by sea by way of a sailboat or cruise ship from Rio de Janeiro, Angra dos Reis and Ilha Grande.

Paraty is connected by road to Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo (via road BR-101). Air-conditioned buses leave to go back and forth from Rio to Paraty and Paraty to Rio.

<text>Wrocław Medical University (Polish: &quot;Uniwersytet Medyczny we Wrocławiu&quot;, Latin: &quot;Universitas Medicus Vratislaviensis&quot;) is an institution of higher medical education in Wrocław, Poland.

It consists of five faculties: Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health and Postgraduate Education. The total number of chairs and clinics is 107. Altogether, 891 academic professors and teachers work at the Medical University and about 3,500 students study there.

Wrocław Medical University has 22 international agreements of cooperation signed with other universities abroad. There is a wide exchange of students and teaching staff within the framework of the Socrates and Erasmus programmes of the European Union, especially with France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands and England.

==History==
Wrocław is a city with a rich medical tradition. The first hospital was founded in the 13th century. Medicine was first taught in 1745 by the establishment of the Collegium Medico-Chirurgicum. It was the first medical school in the city. Many famous doctors lived and worked in Wrocław such as Alois Alzheimer - neurologist and psychiatrist, who presented his findings regarding degeneration of the brain cortex (Alzheimer&#x27;s disease), Robert Koch - creator of modern bacteriology (Nobel Prize in 1905), Paul Ehrlich - pioneer of present chemotherapy (Nobel Prize in 1908).

At present Wrocław is an active centre of medical education. The process of teaching is realised by a team of highly qualified specialists. The Medical University also performs a wide range of scientific activities and provides the whole region of Lower Silesia with highly specialised medical care.

Historically, the city&#x27;s strategic location between branches of the slow running Oder River, which forms many islands in the area, was utilised in the Middle Ages when Wrocław was turned into a fortress. In early modern times, the system of defence was expanded. It is seen now as fortifications, surrounding its historical centre of original architecture. At the end of the Second World War, 70% of the town was destroyed. A great effort was needed to restore and rebuild the university buildings.

The Faculty of Medicine is the oldest and largest faculty of Wrocław Medical University. It was established on November 14, 1945, as one of the six faculties of Wrocław&#x27;s University and Technical University. The opening lecture was given by Ludwik Hirszfeld. The scientific staff consisted mainly of professors from the Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov. In 1950, the Wrocław Medical University was established, consisting of the Faculty of Medicine and the Faculty of Pharmacy. Since then, 16,068 medical doctors and 4,715 dentists have graduated. On February 12, 1958, Prof. Wiktor Bross was the first in Poland to perform open heart surgery, which he did at the Faculty of Medicine, and on March 31, 1966, he performed the first kidney transplant from a living donor together with Prof. Wladyslaw Wrezlewicz. These achievements were significant in European medicine. A great number of prominent scientists have conducted research at the Faculty of Medicine, including Professors Ludwik Hirszfeld, Zygmunt Albert, Edward Szczeklik, Witold Orłowski, Stefan Ślopek and Hugon and Zofia Kowarzyk.

Two new faculties, the Faculty of Postgraduate Medical Training in 1992 and Faculty of Dentistry in 2000, were created based on the organisational structure and lecturing staff of the Faculty of Medicine. After these changes, the Faculty of Medicine assumed more of the educational duties of the University. In 2002 the faculty received the PE-EN ISO 9001 certificate for its educational and research programs in accordance with the standards defined by the Polish Centre for Testing and Certification.

<doc id="446712" wikidata="Q764228" url="?curid=446712" title="Josephson effect">
<text>In physics, the Josephson effect is a phenomenon that occurs when two superconductors are placed in proximity, with some barrier or restriction between them. The effect is named after the British physicist Brian Josephson, who predicted in 1962 the mathematical relationships for the current and voltage across the weak link. It is an example of a macroscopic quantum phenomenon, where the effects of quantum mechanics are observable at ordinary, rather than atomic, scale. The Josephson effect has many practical applications because it exhibits a precise relationship between different physical measures, such as voltage and frequency, facilitating highly accurate measurements.

The Josephson effect produces a current, known as a supercurrent, that flows continuously without any voltage applied, across a device known as a Josephson junction (JJ). These consist of two or more superconductors coupled by a weak link. The weak link can be a thin insulating barrier (known as a superconductor–insulator–superconductor junction, or S-I-S), a short section of non-superconducting metal (S-N-S), or a physical constriction that weakens the superconductivity at the point of contact (S-c-S).

Josephson junctions have important applications in quantum-mechanical circuits, such as SQUIDs, superconducting qubits, and RSFQ digital electronics. The NIST standard for one volt is achieved by an array of 20,208 Josephson junctions in series.

==History==
The DC Josephson effect had been seen in experiments prior to 1962, but had been attributed to &quot;super-shorts&quot; or breaches in the insulating barrier leading to the direct conduction of electrons between the superconductors.

In 1962, Brian Josephson became interested into superconducting tunneling. He was then 23 years old and a second-year graduate student of Brian Pippard at the Mond Laboratory of the University of Cambridge. That year, Josephson took a many-body theory course with Philip W. Anderson, a Bell Labs employee on sabbatical leave for the 1961–1962 academic year. The course introduced 
Josephson to the idea of broken symmetry in superconductors, and he &quot;was fascinated by the idea of broken symmetry, and wondered whether there could be any way of observing it experimentally&quot;. Josephson studied the experiments by Ivar Giaever and Hans Meissner, and theoretical work by Robert Parmenter. Pippard initially believed that the tunneling effect was possible but that it would be too small to be noticeable, but Josephson did not agree, especially after Anderson introduced him to a preprint of &quot;Superconductive Tunneling&quot; by Cohen, Falicov, and Phillips about the superconductor-barrier-normal metal system.

Josephson and his colleagues were initially unsure about the validity of Josephson&#x27;s calculations. Anderson later remembered:

We were all—Josephson, Pippard and myself, as well as various other people who also habitually sat at the Mond tea and participated in the discussions of the next few weeks—very much puzzled by the meaning of the fact that the current depends on the phase.

After further review, they concluded that Josephson&#x27;s results were valid. Josephson then submitted &quot;Possible new effects in superconductive tunnelling&quot; to &quot;Physics Letters&quot; in June 1962. The newer journal &quot;Physics Letters&quot; was chosen instead of the better established &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; due to their uncertainty about the results. John Bardeen, by then already Nobel Prize winner, was initially publicly skeptical of Josephson&#x27;s theory in 1962, but came to accept it after further experiments and theoretical clarifications. See also: .

In January 1963, Anderson and his Bell Labs colleague John Rowell submitted the first paper to &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; to claim the experimental observation of Josephson&#x27;s effect &quot;Probable Observation of the Josephson Superconducting Tunneling Effect&quot;. These authors were awarded patents on the effects that were never enforced, but never challenged.

Before Josephson&#x27;s prediction, it was only known that single (i.e., non-paired) electrons can flow through an insulating barrier, by means of quantum tunneling. Josephson was the first to predict the tunneling of superconducting Cooper pairs. For this work, Josephson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973. John Bardeen was one of the nominators.

==Applications== 
 Types of Josephson junction include the φ Josephson junction (of which π Josephson junction is a special example), long Josephson junction, and superconducting tunnel junction. Other uses include:

* A &quot;Dayem bridge&quot; is a thin-film Josephson junction where the weak link comprises a superconducting wire measuring a few micrometres or less.
* The Josephson junction count is a proxy variable for a device&#x27;s complexity
* SQUIDs, or superconducting quantum interference devices, are very sensitive magnetometers that operate via the Josephson effect
* Superfluid helium quantum interference devices (SHeQUIDs) are the superfluid helium analog of a dc-SQUID
* In precision metrology, the Josephson effect is a reproducible conversion between frequency and voltage. The Josephson voltage standard takes the caesium standard definition of frequency and gives the standard representation of a volt
* Single-electron transistors are often made from superconducting materials and called &quot;superconducting single-electron transistors&quot;.
* Elementary charge is most precisely measured in terms of the Josephson constant and the von Klitzing constant which is related to the quantum Hall effect
* RSFQ digital electronics are based on shunted Josephson junctions. Junction switching emits one magnetic flux quantum formula_1. Its presence and absence represents binary 1 and 0.
* Superconducting quantum computing uses Josephon junctions as qubits such as in a flux qubit or other schemes where the phase and charge are conjugate variables.
* Superconducting tunnel junction detectors are used in superconducting cameras

==The Josephson equations==

The Josephson effect can be calculated using the laws of quantum mechanics. A diagram of a single Josephson junction is shown at right. Assume that superconductor A has Ginzburg–Landau order parameter formula_2, and superconductor B formula_3, which can be interpreted as the wave functions of Cooper pairs in the two superconductors. If the electric potential difference across the junction is formula_4, then the energy difference between the two superconductors is formula_5, since each Cooper pair has twice the charge of one electron. The Schrödinger equation for this two-state quantum system is therefore:

formula_6

where the constant formula_7 is a characteristic of the junction. To solve the above equation, first calculate the time derivative of the order parameter in superconductor A:

formula_8

and therefore the Schrödinger equation gives:

formula_9

The phase difference of Ginzburg–Landau order parameters across the junction is called the Josephson phase:

formula_10The Schrödinger equation can therefore be rewritten as:

formula_11

and its complex conjugate equation is:

formula_12

Add the two conjugate equations together to eliminate formula_13:

formula_14

Since formula_15, we have:

formula_16

Now, subtract the two conjugate equations to eliminate formula_17:

formula_18

which gives:

formula_19

Similarly, for superconductor B we can derive that:

formula_20

Noting that the evolution of Josephson phase is formula_21 and the time derivative of charge carrier density formula_22 is proportional to current formula_23, when formula_24, the above solution yields the Josephson equations:


where formula_25 and formula_26 are the voltage across and the current through the Josephson junction, and formula_27 is a parameter of the junction named the critical current. Equation (1) is called the first Josephson relation or weak-link current-phase relation, and equation (2) is called the second Josephson relation or superconducting phase evolution equation. The critical current of the Josephson junction depends on the properties of the superconductors, and can also be affected by environmental factors like temperature and externally applied magnetic field.

The Josephson constant is defined as:

formula_28

and its inverse is the magnetic flux quantum:

formula_29

The superconducting phase evolution equation can be reexpressed as:

formula_30

If we define:

formula_31

then the voltage across the junction is:

formula_32

which is very similar to Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. But note that this voltage does not come from magnetic energy, since there is no magnetic field in the superconductors; Instead, this voltage comes from the kinetic energy of the carriers (i.e. the Cooper pairs). This phenomenon is also known as kinetic inductance.

== Three main effects ==

There are three main effects predicted by Josephson that follow directly from the Josephson equations:

===The DC Josephson effect===
The DC Josephson effect is a direct current crossing the insulator in the absence of any external electromagnetic field, owing to tunneling. This DC Josephson current is proportional to the sine of the Josephson phase (phase difference across the insulator, which stays constant over time), and may take values between formula_33 and formula_27.

===The AC Josephson effect===
With a fixed voltage formula_35 across the junction, the phase will vary linearly with time and the current will be a sinusoidal AC (alternating current) with amplitude formula_27 and frequency formula_37. This means a Josephson junction can act as a perfect voltage-to-frequency converter.

===The inverse AC Josephson effect===
Microwave radiation of a single (angular) frequency formula_38 can induce quantized DC voltages across the Josephson junction, in which case the Josephson phase takes the form formula_39, and the voltage and current across the junction will be:
formula_40

The DC components are:
formula_41

This means a Josephson junction can act like a perfect frequency-to-voltage converter, which is the theoretical basis for the Josephson voltage standard.

== Josephson inductance ==
When the current and Josephson phase varies over time, the voltage drop across the junction will also vary accordingly; As shown in derivation below, the Josephson relations determine that this behavior can be modeled by a kinetic inductance named Josephson Inductance.

Rewrite the Josephson relations as:

:formula_42

Now, apply the chain rule to calculate the time derivative of the current:

:formula_43

Rearrange the above result in the form of the current–voltage characteristic of an inductor:

:formula_44

This gives the expression for the kinetic inductance as a function of the Josephson Phase:

:formula_45

Here, formula_46 is a characteristic parameter of the Josephson junction, named the Josephson Inductance.

Note that although the kinetic behavior of the Josephson junction is similar to that of an inductor, there is no associated magnetic field. This behaviour is derived from the kinetic energy of the charge carriers, instead of the energy in a magnetic field.

==Josephson energy==
Based on the similarity of the Josephson junction to a non-linear inductor, the energy stored in a Josephson junction when a supercurrent flows through it can be calculated.

The supercurrent flowing through the junction is related to the Josephson phase by the current-phase relation (CPR):

:formula_47

The superconducting phase evolution equation is analogous to Faraday&#x27;s law:

:formula_48

Assume that at time formula_49, the Josephson phase is formula_50; At a later time formula_51, the Josephson phase evolved to formula_52. The energy increase in the junction is equal to the work done on the junction:

:formula_53

This shows that the change of energy in the Josephson junction depends only on the initial and final state of the junction and not the path. Therefore, the energy stored in a Josephson junction is a state function, which can be defined as:

:formula_54

Here formula_55 is a characteristic parameter of the Josephson junction, named the Josephson Energy. It is related to the Josephson Inductance by formula_56. An alternative but equivalent definition formula_57 is also often used.

Again, note that a non-linear magnetic coil inductor accumulates potential energy in its magnetic field when a current passes through it; However, in the case of Josephson junction, no magnetic field is created by a supercurrent — the stored energy comes from the kinetic energy of the charge carriers instead.

== The RCSJ model ==
The Resistively Capacitance Shunted Junction (RCSJ) model, or simply shunted junction model, includes the effect of AC impedance of an actual Josephson junction on top of the two basic Josephson relations stated above.

As per Thévenin&#x27;s theorem, the AC impedance of the junction can be represented by a capacitor and a shunt resistor, both parallel to the ideal Josephson Junction. The complete expression for the current drive formula_58 becomes:

:formula_59

where the first term is displacement current with formula_60 – effective capacitance, and the third is normal current with formula_61 – effective resistance of the junction.

==Josephson penetration depth==
The Josephson penetration depth characterizes the typical length on which an externally applied magnetic field penetrates into the long Josephson junction. It is usually denoted as formula_62 and is given by the following expression (in SI):

:formula_63

where formula_64 is the magnetic flux quantum, formula_65 is the critical supercurrent density (A/m2), and formula_66 characterizes the inductance of the superconducting electrodes

:formula_67

where formula_68 is the thickness of the Josephson barrier (usually insulator), formula_69 and formula_70 are the thicknesses of superconducting electrodes, and formula_71 and formula_72 are their London penetration depths. The Josephson penetration depth usually ranges from a few μm to several mm if the critical current density is very low.

<text>Dorothy Fields (July 15, 1904 – March 28, 1974) was an American librettist and lyricist. She wrote more than 400 songs for Broadway musicals and films. Her best-known pieces include &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; (1936), &quot;A Fine Romance&quot; (1936), &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (1930), &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot; (1948), &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot; (1936), &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love&quot; (1935), &quot;You Couldn&#x27;t Be Cuter&quot; (1938) and &quot;Big Spender&quot; (1966). Throughout her career, she collaborated with various influential figures in the American musical theater, including Jerome Kern, Cy Coleman, Irving Berlin, and Jimmy McHugh. Along with Ann Ronell, Dana Suesse, Bernice Petkere, and Kay Swift, she was one of the first successful Tin Pan Alley and Hollywood female songwriters.

==Early life==
Fields was born in Allenhurst, New Jersey, and grew up in New York City. In 1923, Fields graduated from the Benjamin School for Girls in New York City. At school, she was outstanding in the subjects of English, drama, and basketball. Her poems were published in the school&#x27;s literary magazine.

Her family was deeply involved in show business. Her father, Lew Fields, was a Jewish immigrant from Poland who partnered with Joe Weber as one of the most popular comedy vaudeville duos near the end of the nineteenth century. When the duo separated in 1904, Lew Fields became one of the most influential theater producers of his time. From 1904 until 1916, he produced about 40 Broadway shows, and was nicknamed &quot;The King of Musical Comedy&quot; because of his achievements. Her mother was Rose Harris. She had two older brothers, Joseph and Herbert, who also became successful on Broadway: Joseph as a writer and producer and Herbert as a writer who later became Dorothy&#x27;s collaborator.

Despite her natural familial connections to the theatre via her father, he disapproved of her choice to pursue acting and did everything he could to prevent her from becoming a serious actress. This began when he refused to let her take a job with a stock company in Yonkers. Hence, Dorothy began working as a teacher and a laboratory assistant while secretly submitting work to magazines.

==Career==
Early in her career Fields appeared on stage with English actress and socialite Sylvia Ashley—who subsequently married Douglas Fairbanks Sr and Clark Gable—as &quot;Silly and Dotty&quot; in &quot;Midnight Follies&quot; at the London Metropole, followed by further appearances in &quot;Tell me More&quot; at London&#x27;s Winter Gardens and &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot; 
In 1926, Fields met the popular song composer J. Fred Coots, who proposed that the two begin writing songs together. Nothing actually came out of this interaction and introduction; however, Coots introduced Fields to another composer and song plugger, Jimmy McHugh.

Fields&#x27;s career as a professional songwriter took off in 1928 when Jimmy McHugh, who had seen some of her early work, invited her to provide some lyrics for him for &quot;Blackbirds of 1928&quot;. The show, starring Adelaide Hall, became a Broadway hit. Fields and McHugh teamed up until 1935. Songs from this period include &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give You Anything But Love&quot; (1928), &quot;Exactly Like You&quot; (1930), and &quot;On the Sunny Side of the Street&quot; (1930). During the later 1920s, she and McHugh wrote specialty numbers for the various Cotton Club revues, many of which were recorded by Duke Ellington.

In the mid-1930s, Fields started to write lyrics for films and collaborated with other composers, including Jerome Kern. With Kern, she worked on the movie version of &quot;Roberta&quot; and also on their greatest success, &quot;Swing Time&quot;. The song &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; earned the Fields/Kern team an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1936.

She wrote the lyrics for the songs in the 1936 movie &quot;The King Steps Out&quot;, based on the early years of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, directed by Josef von Sternberg.

Fields returned to New York and worked again on Broadway shows, but now as a librettist, first with Arthur Schwartz on &quot;Stars In Your Eyes&quot;. (They reteamed in 1951 for &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot;.) In the 1940s, she teamed up with her brother Herbert Fields, with whom she wrote the books for three Cole Porter shows, &quot;Let&#x27;s Face It!&quot;, &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;, and &quot;Mexican Hayride&quot;.

In 1945, Fields approached Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II with her idea for a new musical based on the life of famous female sharpshooter Annie Oakley. They liked the idea and agreed to produce the show conjointly. Kern and Fields were signed on to write the songs in the show. Kern died before the two were able to begin working on the project, and Irving Berlin was hired to replace him.

Together, she and her brother Herbert wrote the book for &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, while Berlin provided all the music. The show, starring Ethel Merman, was a huge success, running for 1,147 performances.

In the 1950s, her biggest success was the show &quot;Redhead&quot; (1959), which won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. When she started collaborating with Cy Coleman in the 1960s, her career took a new turn. Their first work together was &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;. Her last hit was from their second collaboration in 1973, &quot;Seesaw&quot;. The show began on Broadway on March 18, 1973, and ended its run on December 8, 1973. Its signature song was &quot;It&#x27;s Not Where You Start, It&#x27;s Where You Finish&quot;.

Throughout her 48-year career, Fields cowrote more than 400 songs and worked on 15 stage musicals and 26 movies. Her lyrics were known for their strong characterization, clarity in language, and humor. She was an amateur pianist and a lifelong lover of classical music; the awareness of melodic lines that this fostered in her was of value in the task of fitting lyrics to melodies.

Fields&#x27; professional longevity was rare at the time for a songwriter; it was underpinned by her imagination and her willingness to adapt to changing trends in American musical theater.

Fields is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame, inducted posthumously in 1988.

==Personal life==
Fields had highly disciplined work habits. She was known to spend about eight weeks researching, discussing, and making notes on a project before finally returning to her regular 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. daily work routine.

Fields died of a heart attack on March 28, 1974, at the age of 69. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported &quot;Dorothy Fields, the versatile songwriter whose career spanned nearly 50 years, died of a heart attack last night at her home here.&quot; She was the sister of writers Herbert and Joseph Fields. She was introduced to Eli Lahm by his close friend Herbert Sondheim, the father of Stephen Sondheim, who affectionately referred to her as Aunt Dorothy growing up. Fields married Lahm in 1939, and they had two children, David and Eliza. Lahm died in 1958.

==Cultural references==
Thirty-five years after her death, President Barack Obama, in his inauguration speech as 44th president of the United States on January 20, 2009, echoed lyrics by Fields when he said, &quot;Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America&quot;. This alludes to the song &quot;Pick Yourself Up&quot; from the 1936 film &quot;Swing Time&quot;, for which Jerome Kern had written the music, in which Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire sang Fields&#x27;s words, &quot;Pick yourself up; dust yourself off; start all over again&quot;.

<doc id="446745" wikidata="Q756824" url="?curid=446745" title="Temple of Hephaestus">
<text>The Temple of Hephaestus or Hephaisteion (also &quot;Hephesteum&quot; or &quot;Hephaesteum&quot;; , , and formerly called in error the Theseion or &quot;Theseum&quot;; , ), is a well-preserved Greek temple dedicated to Hephaestus; it remains standing largely intact today. It is a Doric peripteral temple, and is located at the north-west side of the Agora of Athens, on top of the Agoraios Kolonos hill. From the 7th century until 1834, it served as the Greek Orthodox church of Saint George Akamates. The building&#x27;s condition has been maintained due to its history of varied use.

==Name==
Hephaestus is the patron god of metal working, craftsmanship, and fire. There were numerous potters&#x27; workshops and metal-working shops in the vicinity of the temple, as befits the temple&#x27;s honoree. Archaeological evidence suggests that there was no earlier building on the site except for a small sanctuary that was burned during the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BCE. The name &quot;Theseion&quot; or Temple of Theseus was attributed to the monument in modern times under the mistaken assumption that it housed the remains of the Athenian hero Theseus, brought back to the city from the island of Skyros by Kimon in 475 BCE, but refuted after inscriptions from within the temple associated it firmly with Hephaestus.

==Construction==
After the battle of Plataea, the Greeks swore never to rebuild their sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians during their invasion of Greece, but to leave them in ruins, as a perpetual reminder of the war. The Athenians directed their funds towards rebuilding their economy and strengthening their influence in the Delian League. When Pericles came to power, he envisioned a grand plan for transforming Athens into the centre of Greek power and culture. Construction started in 449 BCE, and some scholars believe the building not to have been completed for some three decades, funds and workers having been redirected towards the Parthenon. The western frieze was completed between 445–440 BCE, during which time the statue of Athena Hephaistia had been added to the shrine next to the cult statue of Hephaestus, while the eastern frieze, the western pediment and several changes in the building&#x27;s interior are dated by these scholars to 435–430 BCE, largely on stylistic grounds. It was only during the Peace of Nicias (421–415 BCE) that the roof was completed and the cult images were installed.

==Description==
Many architects have been suggested but, without firm evidence, one refers simply to &quot;The Hephaisteion Master&quot;. The temple is built of marble from the nearby Mt. Penteli, excepting the bottom step of the krepis or platform. The architectural sculpture is in both Pentelic and Parian marble. The dimensions of the temple are 13.71 m north to south and 31.78 m east to west, with six columns on the short east and west sides and thirteen columns along the longer north and south sides (with each of the four corner columns being counted twice).
The building has a pronaos, a cella housing cult images at the centre of the structure, and an opisthodomos. The alignment of the antae of the pronaos with the third flank columns of the peristyle is a design element unique to the middle of the 5th century BCE. There is also an inner Doric colonnade with five columns on the north and south side and three across the end (with the corner columns counted twice).

The decorative sculptures highlight the extent of mixture of the two styles in the construction of the temple. Both the pronaos and the opisthodomos are decorated with continuous Ionic friezes instead of the more typical Doric triglyphs, supplementing the sculptures at the pediments. In the pediments, the Birth of Athena (east) and the Return of Hephaistos to Olympos (west), and, as akroteria, the Nereids Thetis and Eurynome (west) accompanied by Nikai, the two ensembles are dated to ca. 430 and ca. 420–413 BCE respectively. The frieze of the pronaos depicts a scene from the battle of Theseus with the Pallantides in the presence of gods while the frieze of the opisthodomos shows the battle of Centaurs and Lapiths.

Only 18 of the 68 metopes of the temple of Hephaestus were sculpted, concentrated especially on the east side of the temple; the rest were perhaps painted. The ten metopes on the east side depict the Labours of Heracles. The four easternmost metopes on the long north and south sides depict the Labours of Theseus.

According to Pausanias, the temple housed bronze statues of Athena and Hephaestus. An inscription records payments between 421–415 BCE for two bronze statues but it does not mention the sculptor. Tradition attributes the work to Alcamenes. Pausanias described the temple in the 2nd century:
Above the Kerameikos [in Athens] and the portico called the King&#x27;s Portico is a temple of Hephaistos. I was not surprised that by it stands a statue of Athena, because I knew the story about Erikhthonios [i.e. the first king of Athens, a son of Hephaistos and Athena, birthed by Gaia the Earth].

In the 3rd century BCE a small garden of pomegranate, myrtle, and laurel trees and shrubs was planted around the temple.

The sanctuary would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.

==Church==

Around CE 700, the temple was turned into a Christian church, dedicated to Saint George. Exactly when the temple was converted to a Christian church remains unknown. There are assumptions however that this possibly occurred in the 7th century.

The addition of adjectives to churches, or their commemorated saints, is commonplace in Greek Orthodox tradition. The characterization as Saint George &quot;Akamates&quot; has been given many explanations. One states that it probably derives from the name of Akamantas, the son of Theseus and Pheadra, later transformed to Akamatos, and later still to Akamates. Another is based on the literal sense of the word &quot;akamates&quot; (= flaneur, or loiterer), because during the Ottoman Era the temple was used only once a year, on the day of the feast of St. George. A third option is that the name is from Archbishop of Athens Michael Akominatos, who might have been the first to celebrate a Divine Liturgy in the church.

The last Divine Liturgy in the temple took place on 21 February 1833, during the celebrations for the arrival of Otto of Greece to his new kingdom. In the presence of the Athenians and of many others the bishop Neophytos Talantiou of Atalante gave a speech.

==19th century==
When Athens became the official capital of Greece in 1834, the publication of the relevant royal edict was made in this temple that was the place of the last public turnout of the Athenians. It was used as a burial place for non-Orthodox Europeans in the 19th century, among whom were many philhellenes who gave their lives in the cause of Greek War of Independence (1821–1830). Among those buried in the site was John Tweddel, a friend of Lord Elgin, while excavations also revealed a slab from the grave of George Watson with a Latin epitaph by Lord Byron. In 1834, the first King of Greece, Otto I, was officially welcomed there. Otto ordered the building to be used as a museum, in which capacity it remained until 1934, when it reverted to its status of an ancient monument and extensive archaeological research was allowed.

<text>RAL is a colour management system used in Europe that is created and administered by the German (RAL non-profit LLC), which is a subsidiary of the German . In colloquial speech, RAL refers to the RAL Classic system, mainly used for varnish and powder coating, but now plastics as well. Approved RAL products are provided with a hologram to make unauthorised versions difficult to produce. Imitations may show different hue and colour when observed under various light sources.

==RAL colour space system==

===RAL Classic===
In 1927, the German group (Imperial Committee for Delivery and Quality Assurance) invented a collection of forty colours under the name of &quot;RAL 840&quot;. Prior to that date, manufacturers and customers had to exchange samples to describe a tint, whereas from then on they would rely on numbers.

In the 1930s, the numbers were changed uniformly to four digits and the collection was renamed to &quot;RAL 840 R&quot; (R for revised).
Around 1940, the RAL colours were changed to the four-digit system, as is customary. Army camouflage colours were always recognized by a &quot;7&quot; or &quot;8&quot; in the first place until 1944. 
With tints constantly added to the collection, it was revised again in 1961 and changed to &quot;RAL 840-HR&quot;, which consists of 210 colours and is in use to this day. In the 1960s, the colours were given supplemental names to avoid confusion in case of transposed digits. At the international furnishing fair &quot;imm Cologne&quot;, 13-19 January 2020, two new colours were presented in the Classic Collection: RAL 2017 RAL orange and RAL 9012 Cleanroom White.

&quot;RAL 840-HR&quot; covered only matte paint, so the 1980s saw the invention of &quot;RAL 841-GL&quot; for glossy surfaces, limited to 193 colours. A main criterion for colours in the RAL Classic collection is to be of &quot;paramount interest&quot;. Therefore, most of the colours in it are used on warning and traffic signs or are dedicated to government agencies and public services (for example: RAL 1004 - Swiss Postal Service, RAL 1021 - Austrian Postal Service, RAL 1032 - German Postal Service). The first digit relates to the shade of the colour:
===RAL F9===
This collection, which follows the naming of RAL Classic, was invented in 1984. It is now made up of ten colours ( RAL 1039-F9 Sand beige, RAL 1040-F9 Clay beige, RAL 6031-F9 Bronze green, RAL 6040-F9 Light olive, RAL 7050-F9 Camouflage grey, RAL 8027-F9 Leather brown, RAL 8031-F9 Sand brown, RAL 9021-F9 Tar black and RAL 6031-F9 HR Bronze green semi-matt) used by the &quot;&quot; for military camouflage coating.

===RAL Design===
In 1993 a new colour matching system was introduced, tailored to the needs of architects, designers and advertisers. It started with 1,688 colours and was revised to 1,625 colours and again to 1,825 colours. The colours of RAL Classic and RAL Design do not intersect.

Contrary to the preceding systems, RAL Design features no names and its numbering follows a scheme based on the CIELAB colour space, specifically cylindrical CIEHLC. Each colour is represented by seven digits, grouped in a triple and two pairs, representing hue (000–360 degrees, angle in the CIELab colour wheel), lightness (same as in &quot;L&quot;*&quot;a&quot;*&quot;b&quot;*) and chroma (relative saturation). The three numeric components of almost all RAL Design colours are multiples of 5, the majority are divisible by 10.

; Conversion from RAL Design number tuple to CIELAB
: formula_1

: RAL 210 50 15 converts to &quot;L&quot;* = 50, &quot;a&quot;* = −12.99, &quot;b&quot;* = −7.5, for instance.

===RAL Effect===
RAL Effect comprises 420 solid colours and seventy metallic colours. It is the first collection from RAL to be based on waterborne paint systems.

===RAL Digital===
RAL Digital is software that allows designers to navigate the RAL colour space.

<text>Irene Jai Narayan (23 February 1932 – 29 July 2011) was an Indian-born teacher and politician, who had a significant influence on politics in Fiji. She came to Fiji in 1959 after marrying Jai Narayan, a well known school Principal in Suva, and began her career as a teacher. She taught in DAV Girls School and MGM High School in Suva before entering politics.

==Member of Legislative Council==

In 1966, she was handpicked by the then leader of the Federation Party, A. D. Patel to contest the Suva Indian Communal seat in the Legislative Council against Andrew Deoki. Deoki was an experienced political campaigner, having represented Suva in the Legislative Council since 1959 and had wide social contacts. He was the only non-Federation Indian member elected in the 1963 elections. A.D. Patel was of the opinion that a female candidate would be able to counteract some of Deoki&#x27;s influence in the constituency. In the end Irene Narayan won easily by 5,676 votes to 2,779 votes. She increased her majority in the 1968 by-election. For a long time, she remained the sole Indian female member of the Legislative Council.

==Member of House of Representatives==
Irene Narayan was elected to the Dominion of Fiji&#x27;s House of Representatives in the 1972, 1977 (March), 1977 (September) and 1982 elections, from the Suva Indian Communal Constituency. In 1977 when the National Federation Party split into two factions, she joined the &quot;Flower&quot; faction, with Jai Ram Reddy, opposed to Sidiq Koya&#x27;s &quot;Dove&quot; faction. In the September, 1977 election, the &quot;Flower&quot; faction won most of the seats reserved for Indians, Jai Ram Reddy became the Leader of the Opposition and Irene Narayan played an influential role within the &quot;Flower&quot; faction. In January 1977, &quot;The Fiji Times&quot; honoured her as its Woman of the Year.

==Resignation from NFP==

She served as president of the party from 1976 to 1979. She was also the Opposition Whip from 1977 to 1979, and Deputy Leader of the Opposition from 1979 to 1985. In 1985, following the resignation of Jai Ram Reddy, she narrowly lost a bid to lead the opposition, to Sidiq Koya. Relations between her and the new leader remained strained and she resigned from the National Federation Party (NFP) after electoral setback in a by-election, accusing Koya of favouring his own supporters over party unity and stating that &quot;the NFP has no future and is no longer virile as an opposition party.&quot;

==Member of Alliance Party==

Between 1985 and 1987, the NFP again went through internal turmoil and many of its Parliamentarians resigned from the Party, but while most joined the fledgling Fiji Labour Party, Irene Narayan surprised everyone by joining the Alliance Party, which she had bitterly opposed throughout her political career. The Alliance Party was aware that she would not be able to hold the Suva City Indian Communal seat on its ticket and so rewarded her with the marginal seat of Suva Indian National Constituency. The Alliance had never lost this seat but in the general election of 1987, the loss of this seat led to the narrow defeat of the Alliance Party.

==Post coup politics==
Following two military coups in 1987, she was one of the few Indo-Fijians who agreed to serve (as Minister of Indian Affairs) in the transitional government of 1987–92, a government that was widely condemned by many of her fellow Indo-Fijians for promulgating a constitution which many saw as racist as it ensured ethnic Fijian political supremacy. She served as a Senator from 1994 to 99, and in 1985 co-founded the Fiji Indian Congress. Although a Hindu, she played a leading role in the founding of the Christian Democratic Alliance in 1999.

Early in 2005, Narayen joined the National Alliance Party, a new party founded by &quot;Ratu&quot; Epeli Ganilau as an attempt to revive the defunct Alliance Party. She participated in the official launch of the party on 8 April 2005.

<doc id="446751" wikidata="Q1342312" url="?curid=446751" title="John Squire">
<text>Jonathan Thomas &quot;John&quot; Squire (born 24 November 1962) is an English musician, songwriter and painter. He was the guitarist for the Stone Roses, a rock band in which he formed a songwriting partnership with lead singer Ian Brown. After leaving the Stone Roses he went on to found The Seahorses and has since released two solo albums. In 2007, Squire gave up music to fully commit to painting. However, he later returned to music when the Stone Roses reformed in 2011. When the Stone Roses disbanded for a second time in 2017, Squire once again retired from music industry and returned to painting. However, he continued to play guitar occasionally, including making guest appearances for two shows with Liam Gallagher at Knebworth in 2022. In late 2023 he started working with Liam Gallagher on a collaborative studio album which was released in 2024.

Squire has been described as one of the most accomplished and influential British rock guitarists of the late 1980s and early 1990s, known for his chiming melodies, spiraling riffs and live solos. He was voted the 13th greatest guitarist of the last 30 years in a national poll by BBC 6 Music in 2010.

==Early life==
Squire was born in Broadheath, Altrincham, Cheshire. He grew up on Sylvan Avenue in Timperley, around the corner from Ian Brown, and after attending Heyes Lane Junior School, he passed the eleven plus exam and went on to attend Altrincham Grammar School for Boys. As a child he excelled at art. He formed a close friendship with Ian Brown during their last two years at school together after Brown aided him in a fight with a school bully. The two further bonded over a shared love for punk rock, particularly the Clash.

Squire and Brown moved on to South Trafford College after passing O-Levels. Brown got expelled and Squire dropped out shortly after in order to start a band. Although Squire had a couple of guitar lessons, he was largely self-taught.

==The Stone Roses==
In the early 1980s Squire and Brown founded a band, Patrol, that eventually became the Stone Roses. Squire was lead guitarist, and the partnership between him and Brown formed the heart of the band&#x27;s lyrical and musical output.

The Stone Roses became one of the most influential acts of its era. Their 1989 eponymous debut album quickly achieved the status of a classic in the UK, and topped &quot;NME&quot; list of the Greatest British Albums of All Time. Squire (calling himself John, instead of his birth name of Jonathan) co-wrote all of the tracks with Brown and painted the cover art, a Jackson Pollock-influenced piece containing references to the May 1968 riots in Paris.

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Second Coming&quot; was released in 1994. It featured a heavier blues-rock sound, similar to Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers Band, but fused with Ian Brown&#x27;s distinct Britpop vocal style. The album also featured Squire&#x27;s vocals for the first time on &#x27;Tightrope&#x27; and &#x27;How Do You Sleep&#x27;. Squire wrote the majority of its songs alone. The album was met with mixed reaction from fans, and shortly after band infighting and rumoured cocaine abuse led to his departure from the band on 1 April 1996. The band dissolved six months later.

==The Seahorses and solo career partnerships==
With three previously unknown musicians, Squire formed a new band, The Seahorses, in 1996. The band&#x27;s only album &quot;Do it Yourself&quot; was released in 1997. It is alleged the bands name forms an anagram of &quot;He Hates Roses&quot;, for Squire&#x27;s dislike of his previous band the Stone Roses. The Seahorses disbanded due to creative differences in 1999.
Following the demise of the Seahorses, Squire continued work with drummer Mark Heaney and ex-Verve bassist Simon Jones along with new vocalist Duncan Baxter as John Squire&#x27;s Skunkworks, but left prior to the band releasing material as the Shining.

Squire released his first solo album, &quot;Time Changes Everything&quot; in 2002. A concept album followed in 2004 entitled &quot;Marshall&#x27;s House&quot;. Squire has also said that he has recorded a third album, however he has decided not to release it as he felt that promoting and touring the album would take the fun out of the music, and turn it into a job rather than a hobby. This is the second time that Squire has recorded material and opted to keep it unreleased, as he did the same in 1999 as a part of the Seahorses, when they started recording tracks for an album, set to be named &quot;Minus Blue&quot; or &quot;Motorcade&quot;, but due to musical differences, the band split up before the album could be finished.

In 2024, Squire collaborated with Liam Gallagher on the album &quot;Liam Gallagher &amp; John Squire&quot;, which they released on 1 March 2024. Their number one album had been preceded by the singles &quot;Just Another Rainbow&quot; (peaking at number sixteen in the UK Singles Chart) the second single &quot;Mars to Liverpool&quot; they performed live on ITV on The Jonathan Ross Show which aired 9 March. Squire and Gallagher announced their debut tour, on 26 January 2024, with sell out performances in Leeds, Glasgow, Manchester, Newcastle, London and Dublin.

==Artwork==
Besides music, Squire is also a published artist. His artwork has adorned the singles, album covers and promotional posters for his and the Stone Roses&#x27; music. In the 1980s, Squire&#x27;s artistic style was heavily influenced by the action painting technique of Jackson Pollock. In recent years, Squire has shown a broader use of media and has incorporated newer influences to his work. One such item – a surfboard covered with Beach Boys song lyrics, which was for the War Child charity to auction – featured on the cover for Travis&#x27;s 1997 single release &quot;U16 Girls&quot; and their debut album &quot;Good Feeling&quot;. In 2004, Squire held two well-received art exhibitions in London and Manchester.

He has exhibited his artwork at the Smithfield Gallery (July 2007) and the Dazed Gallery, London (September – October 2007). At the Smithfield Gallery opening, Squire told a reporter from the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; that he was giving up music for good. He explained that &quot;I&#x27;m enjoying this far too much to go back to music.&quot; When asked about a Stone Roses reunion, he said it was &quot;highly unlikely&quot;.

In January 2009, Squire launched a new exhibition of his art entitled &quot;Heavy Metal Semantics&quot;, in London, and further exhibitions in Oldham, Austria and Tokyo later in the year. Further exhibitions include Edinburgh in August 2010, Brussels in early 2011 and London in 2019.

In late 2012, Squire&#x27;s art studio burned down. The studio, a converted sheep barn on his farm in Cheshire, was ruled to have caught ablaze by accident. Squire said he was &quot;extremely sad&quot; that a lot of his artwork had been destroyed.

==Intentions for a Stone Roses reunion==
After leaving the Stone Roses, Squire had a lasting feud with ex-bandmate Ian Brown, with the pair not having spoken in over a decade since Squire&#x27;s departure from the band. In a 2005 &quot;Q magazine&quot; article, Squire blasted Brown, claiming &quot;When he (Brown) was stoned, he was at best a tuneless knob and at worst a paranoid mess&quot; (this was in response to queries about what had gone wrong with the &quot;Second Coming&quot; recording sessions, and the state of Brown&#x27;s vocal due to his cannabis intake). Although both Brown and Squire performed Stone Roses songs in their solo gigs, a band reunion seemed unlikely. Squire was interviewed in June 2007 by Dave Haslam on XFM Manchester radio and discussed his current work as an artist, and claimed that even if Brown phoned him and suggested a Stone Roses reunion, he would turn the offer down. But in an interview on &quot;The Culture Show&quot; in 2008, Squire stated: &quot;I went to that Led Zeppelin reunion show, and on the way back in the car I was thinking it would be good to do something like that one day.&quot;

In March 2009, Squire appeared to put an end to speculation surrounding the Stone Roses&#x27; reunion by defacing one of his artworks with the text &quot;I have no desire whatsoever to desecrate the grave of seminal Manchester pop group the Stone Roses.&quot; Also on 19 March 2009, Squire appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot;, and when asked if a reunion would ever occur, he stated that it would &quot;absolutely most definitely not&quot;. He said he came on air to address the fans once and for all and also, &quot;to stop the phones ringing.&quot; He also stated his belief that music is a young person&#x27;s game.

In March 2011, Brown and Squire met at the funeral of Mani&#x27;s mother, leading to speculation that the band would reform. This was angrily denied at the time by Mani. However, on 18 October 2011, at London&#x27;s Soho Hotel, the Stone Roses announced that they would reunite for the first time in fifteen years, playing three shows at Heaton Park, Manchester, on 29 and 30 June and 1 July 2012 as part of an extensive Reunion Tour, and on 2 December 2011 Brown and Squire performed together live for the first time since 1995. They joined Mick Jones from the Clash, the Farm and Pete Wylie at the Manchester Ritz in aid of the Justice for Hillsborough campaign. They performed &quot;Elizabeth My Dear&quot; as a duo before being joined by Mick Jones and the Farm for renditions of the Clash&#x27;s &quot;Bankrobber&quot; and &quot;Armagideon Time&quot; with Ian Brown taking on lead vocals for the three songs. The Stone Roses played a European tour in the summer of 2012. The band played around the world, playing their last concert in 2017. Squire then returned to painting. In a 2019 interview he said he had written and recorded some songs but only his wife had heard them. 

On 3 and 4 June 2022, Squire made his first stage appearances in five years at the encore of Liam Gallagher&#x27;s two Knebworth House concerts, as a guest guitarist on the song &quot;Champagne Supernova&quot;. These mirrored the guest appearances he had previously made at Oasis&#x27; record-breaking Knebworth shows in 1996.

== Personal life ==
Squire is married to wife Sophie Upton, with whom he has three children. He also has three more children from a previous relationship. Squire and Upton live on a farm in rural Cheshire.

<doc id="446752" wikidata="Q27451" url="?curid=446752" title="Underground (Murakami book)">
<text>is a book by Japanese novelist Haruki Murakami about the 1995 Aum Shinrikyo sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway. The book is made up of a series of interviews with individuals who were affected by the attacks, and the English translation also includes interviews with members of Aum, the religious cult responsible for the attacks. Murakami hoped that through these interviews, he could capture a side of the attacks which the sensationalist Japanese media had ignored—the way it had affected average citizens. The interviews were conducted over nearly a year, starting in January 1996 and ending in December of that same year.

The interviews highlight many intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche. Work was a high, if not central, priority for most of the interviewees. Isolation, individualism, and lack of communication were also strong themes which were common throughout many accounts of the attacks. Many of the interviewees expressed disillusionment with the materialism in Japanese society and the sensationalistic media, as well as the inefficiency of the emergency response system in dealing with the attack.

The book also includes Murakami&#x27;s personal essay on the attacks, &quot;Blind Nightmare: Where Are We Japanese Going?&quot; In this essay, he criticizes the failure of the Japanese to learn from the attacks, preferring to dismiss it as the extreme act by a group of lunatics rather than analyze the true causes and prevent similar events from occurring in the future.

Both the Japanese original and the English translation were well-received, despite the former being criticized as being &quot;one-sided,&quot; and the latter being severely abridged.

==History==
Described as a work of &quot;journalistic literature,&quot; &quot;Underground&quot; was originally published as a series of separate interviews Murakami conducted with 60 victims of the attacks and descriptions of how the attacks were carried out, along with his essay, &quot;Blind Nightmare: Where Are We Japanese Going?&quot; In 2000, an English translation was published which included interviews with 8 members of Aum.

&quot;Underground&quot; was originally published in Japan without the interviews of Aum members – they were published in the magazine &quot;Bungei Shunju&quot; before being collected in a separate volume, &quot;The Place That Was Promised&quot;. The English translation combines both books into a single volume, but has been abridged. &quot;Underground&quot; was translated by Alfred Birnbaum and &quot;The Place That Was Promised&quot; by Philip Gabriel.

==Motivations==
In his introduction to the book, Murakami describes his motivations for writing it:

The Japanese media had bombarded us with so many in-depth profiles of the Aum cult perpetrators—the &#x27;attackers&#x27;—forming such a slick, seductive narrative that the average citizen—the &#x27;victim&#x27;—was an afterthought ... which is why I wanted, if at all possible, to get away from any formula; to recognise that each person on the subway that morning had a face, a life, a family, hopes and fears, contradictions and dilemmas—and that all these factors had a place in the drama ... 
Furthermore, I had a hunch that we needed to see a true picture of
all the survivors, whether they were severely traumatized or not, in
order to better grasp the whole incident.
Jay Rubin holds that Murakami also had highly personal reasons for wanting to write &quot;Underground&quot;, notably that he wished to learn more about Japan after living almost entirely abroad for nine years and that he wanted to fulfill a responsibility he felt towards Japan&#x27;s society.

==Method==
The interviews in &quot;Underground&quot; were conducted throughout 1996. They were taped, transcribed, and then edited. Draft interviews were then sent to the interviewees before publication for fact-checking and to allow them to cut any parts they did not want published.

At the start of each interview, Murakami asked general questions about the subject&#x27;s life, allowing him to build a background picture of them that is included before each interview. He did this to &quot;give each a &#x27;face,&#x27;&quot; thus avoiding creating &quot;a collection of disembodied voices.&quot; His interviews with victims have been seen as similar in style to those of Studs Terkel&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, an influence that Murakami acknowledges along with that of journalist Bob Greene. His interviews with Aum members are intentionally more combative.

==Conclusions==
Murakami concludes &quot;Underground&quot; with the essay, &quot;Blind Nightmare: Where Are We Japanese Going?&quot; The essay is primarily a criticism of the Japanese response to the gas attacks, not only in terms of the actions which were taken, but also in terms of the mentality adopted by most Japanese after the attack. He notes that there is a polemic which was put forth by the media and too readily accepted by the Japanese people, positing the attacks as a matter of &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;evil,&quot; &quot;sanity&quot; versus &quot;madness,&quot; &quot;Us&quot; versus &quot;Them.&quot; By viewing the sarin attacks as &quot;an extreme and exceptional crime committed by an isolated lunatic fringe,&quot; it was easy for Japanese citizens to avoid facing the darker realities (which Murakami also refers to as the &quot;underground,&quot; adding a deeper layer of meaning to the book&#x27;s title) of both Japanese society and their own selves.

In the course of conducting his interviews, Murakami observed that &quot;most Japanese seem ready to pack up the whole incident in a trunk labeled THINGS OVER AND DONE WITH,&quot; but this mentality prevents them from learning from the event. In particular, Murakami criticizes the Japanese crisis management system as being &quot;erratic and sorely inadequate.&quot; He further worries that the government&#x27;s lack of openness about its failings may lead to the repetition of past mistakes. Murakami also discusses one factor that led to the attacks – the handing over of personal responsibility by cult members to Aum leader Shoko Asahara – however, he notes that perhaps everyone, himself included, does this to an extent, accepting someone else&#x27;s &quot;narrative&quot; rather than take the responsibility of creating their own.

==Reception==
The original &quot;Underground&quot; (sans Aum interviews) was seen by some critics as being &quot;one-sided,&quot; a view that Murakami himself shared, leading to his publishing &quot;The Place That Was Promised&quot;. The book sold 270,000 copies within two months of its Japanese release.

Reviews of the English translation were largely positive and enthusiastic, despite a severe cut in the number of commuter interviews included in the work—from 62 in the original to 34 in the translation. Globally, &quot;Complete Review&quot; saying on the consensus &quot;Enthusiastic, although the reviews tend to be descriptive rather than critical&quot;.

==Common themes==
While the book is made up of narratives from individuals of widely varying backgrounds, the stories share common themes, and together, they reveal many intriguing aspects of the Japanese psyche and the values of Japanese society as a whole. In particular, they present an insight into the lifestyle and mentality of Japanese commuters (since the attacks occurred in the morning, nearly all of the interviewees were caught in the subway while making their morning commute).

One of the most prominent themes was the value and importance which the interviewees placed on their jobs. Working overtime seemed to be normal for the interviewees – many spoke of waking up early so they could arrive at work up to 90 minutes before it officially began. Although they were suffering from extreme physical symptoms from inhaling sarin, most of the interviewees continued on their way to work, only reporting to the hospital for treatment when unable to carry out their responsibilities at work, or under the insistence of a colleague or superior. Several of the interviewees returned to work quite soon after the attacks, despite not being fully recovered. One salesman said, &quot;Honestly, it would have been better for me to take some time off with sick pay, but the company wasn&#x27;t that generous. It was nine to five, plus overtime just like always.&quot;

Also significant was the theme of isolation and disconnection between the commuters. Despite the noticeable discomfort caused by the gas, most of the interviewees did not bother to ask other passengers what was going on, preferring to wait until the next stop to change trains and distance themselves from the situation. One interviewee said, &quot;No one said a thing, everyone was so quiet. No response, no communication. I lived in America for a year, and believe me, if the same thing had happened in America there would have been a real scene. With everyone shouting, &quot;What&#x27;s going on here?&quot; and coming together to find the cause.&quot; Also, passengers that lost consciousness remained lying on the floor for some time. Commuters, with a few notable exceptions, did not attempt to help them, instead waiting for employees whose authority allowed them to intervene.

Many of the interviewees also expressed a level of disillusionment with Japanese society and its emphasis on the material, often at the expense of the spiritual or moral side of the society. One interviewee assessed the situation, saying, &quot;we&#x27;ve lost any sense of crisis and material things are all that matters. The idea that it&#x27;s wrong to harm other has gradually disappeared.&quot; Another interviewee, a subway worker, said, &quot;I already knew society had gotten to the point where something like Aum had to happen ... It&#x27;s a question of morals.&quot; Several interviewees also voiced criticism of the media, namely due to the way it misrepresented and sensationalized the sarin attacks. Murakami himself expressed similar sentiments in the book&#x27;s preface.

<text>Henry Shakespear Stephens Salt (; 20 September 1851 – 19 April 1939) was a British writer and campaigner for social reform in the fields of prisons, schools, economic institutions, and the treatment of animals. He was a noted ethical vegetarian, anti-vivisectionist, socialist, and pacifist, and was well known as a literary critic, biographer, classical scholar and naturalist. It was Salt who first introduced Mohandas Gandhi to the influential works of Henry David Thoreau, and influenced Gandhi&#x27;s study of vegetarianism. Salt is considered, by some, to be the &quot;father of animal rights&quot;, having been one of the first writers to argue explicitly in favour of animal rights, rather than just improvements to animal welfare, in his book &quot;Animals&#x27; Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress&quot; (1892).

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Henry Shakespear Stephens Salt was born in Naini Tal, British India, on 20 September 1851. He was the son of a British Army colonel. In 1852, while he was still an infant, Salt moved with his family to England. He was a King&#x27;s Scholar at Eton College and later studied the classical tripos at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, winning the Browne Medal in 1874 (for Greek epigrams), and graduating with a first-class degree in 1875.

After Cambridge, Salt returned to Eton as an assistant schoolmaster to teach classics. Four years later, in 1879, he married the scholar Catherine (Kate) Leigh Joynes, the daughter of a fellow master at Eton. He remained at Eton until 1884, when, inspired by classic ideals and disgusted by his fellow masters&#x27; meat-eating habits and reliance on servants, he and Kate moved to a small cottage at Tilford, Surrey, where they grew their own vegetables and lived very simply, sustained by a small pension Salt had built up. Salt engrossed himself in writing and began work on the pioneering Humanitarian League.

=== Writing and influence ===
During his lifetime Salt wrote almost 40 books. His first, &quot;A Plea for Vegetarianism&quot; (1886) was published by the Vegetarian Society, and in 1890, he produced an acclaimed biography of philosopher Henry David Thoreau, two interests that later led to a friendship with Mahatma Gandhi. He also wrote, in &quot;On Cambrian and Cumbrian Hills&quot; (1922), about the need for nature conservation to protect the natural beauty of the British countryside from commercial vandalism.

His circle of friends included many notable figures from late-19th and early-20th century literary and political life, including writers Algernon Charles Swinburne, John Galsworthy, James Leigh Joynes (brother-in-law), Edward Carpenter, Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, Havelock Ellis, Count Leo Tolstoy, William Morris, Arnold Hills, Ralph Hodgson, Peter Kropotkin, Ouida, J. Howard Moore, Ernest Bell, George Bernard Shaw and Robert Cunninghame-Graham, as well as Labour leader James Keir Hardie and Fabian Society co-founders Hubert Bland and Annie Besant.

=== Activism ===

==== Vegetarianism ====

Salt&#x27;s shift toward vegetarianism developed alongside his evolving social, political, and religious views, significantly influenced by Shelley, whom he regarded as a key mentor. Howard Williams&#x27; &quot;The Ethics of Diet&quot; praised by Salt for its humane diet advocacy, also played a role in shaping his views. Salt&#x27;s vegetarianism was ultimately based on a deep moral conviction. He saw that meat, commonly regarded as food, was actually the flesh of animals slaughtered under harsh conditions. This understanding prompted him to scrutinise the ethical foundations of civilisation, which he viewed as concealing a fundamental barbarism and violence. He identified this underlying brutality in both humanity&#x27;s treatment of other species and in political, economic, and social relationships, as demonstrated by war, imperialism, and the social injustices resulting from a competitive capitalist system.

Salt&#x27;s commitment to vegetarianism deepened over time. In 1885, he was named a vice-president of the Vegetarian Society. The following year, he published &quot;A Plea for Vegetarianism and Other Essays&quot;, an anthology emphasising his rational approach to vegetarian advocacy over emotional or polemical arguments. Salt argued that vegetarianism was not merely a dietary choice but a critical component of a broader social reform movement aimed at creating a more humane, just, and civil society, which he termed &quot;humanitarianism&quot;.

Notably, Salt&#x27;s writings influenced Gandhi to transition from a religiously motivated vegetarianism to an explicitly ethical one. After encountering Salt&#x27;s &quot;Plea for Vegetarianism&quot; (1886) in a London vegetarian restaurant, Gandhi read it thoroughly and was profoundly impressed. He chose to become a vegetarian by choice, dedicating himself to promoting the diet. Gandhi supported the British vegetarian movement and shared a platform with Salt at a 1931 London Vegetarian Society meeting, where he delivered a speech titled &quot;The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism&quot; explaining his dietary principles.

==== Humanitarian League ====
In 1891, Salt co-founded the Humanitarian League, which aimed to promote humaneness and advocate for social and legal reforms. The League&#x27;s philosophy was rooted in the belief that scientific advances and evolutionary biology had debunked long-held notions of differences between races, classes, and species, advocating for universal sympathy. The League, aligned with early organised humanism, included prominent figures like Howard Williams, Alice Drakoules, Edward Maitland, and Kenneth Romanes. It established an office in London in 1895, launched the journal &quot;Humanity&quot;, and hosted the first National Humanitarian Conference. From 1897 to 1919, headquartered at Chancery Lane, the League actively campaigned against corporal punishment, blood sports, and other societal injustices through press engagements and public debates. After Salt stepped down in 1919, the League dissolved, and in 1924, former members founded the League Against Cruel Sports.

==== Animal rights ====
Keith Tester writes that, in 1892, Salt created an &quot;epistemological break&quot;, by being the first writer to consider the issue of animal rights explicitly, as opposed to better animal welfare. In &quot;Animals&#x27; Rights: Considered in Relation to Social Progress&quot;, Salt wrote that he wanted to &quot;set the principle of animals&#x27; rights on a consistent and intelligible footing, [and] to show that this principle underlies the various efforts of humanitarian reformers ...&quot;:

Even the leading advocates of animal rights seem to have shrunk from basing their claim on the only argument which can ultimately be held to be a really sufficient one—the assertion that animals, as well as men, though, of course, to a far less extent than men, are possessed of a distinctive individuality, and, therefore, are in justice entitled to live their lives with a due measure of that &#x27;restricted freedom&#x27; to which Herbert Spencer alludes.

He wrote that there is no point in claiming rights for animals if we subordinate their rights to human interests, and he argued against the presumption that a human life necessarily has more value than a nonhuman one:

[The] notion of the life of an animal having &#x27;no moral purpose,&#x27; belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day—it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals&#x27; rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a &#x27;great gulf&#x27; fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites all living beings in one universal brotherhood.

=== Later life and death ===

Salt&#x27;s first wife died in 1919; following this, he closed down the Humanitarian League. Salt married Catherine Mandeville on 25 March 1927. In 1935, he published &quot;The Creed of Kinship&quot;, in which he critiqued established religions and laid out his own philosophy which he called &quot;The Creed of Kinship&quot;; it demanded the recognition of an evolutionary and biological affinity between humans and other animals.

In 1933, Salt suffered a stroke. He died six years later at Brighton Municipal Hospital, on 19 April 1939, aged 87; his remains were cremated at Brighton Crematorium.

== Legacy ==
The first biography of Salt, entitled &quot;Salt and His Circle&quot;, was published by Stephen Winsten, with a preface by George Bernard Shaw, in 1951. A second biography, &quot;Humanitarian Reformer and Man of Letters&quot;, was published by George Hendrick, in 1977.

Salt&#x27;s &quot;Animals&#x27; Rights&quot; was reissued in 1980; in the preface, philosopher Peter Singer described the work as the best book of the 18th- and 19th-centuries on animal rights and praised how Salt anticipated many of the issues in the contemporary animal rights debate.

The Henry S. Salt Society was formed with the intention to celebrate the life and works of Salt. Its website provides information on Salt&#x27;s life and on his friends and fellow activists.

<text>Cristofano Allori (17 October 1577 – 1 April 1621) was an Italian painter of the late Florentine Mannerist school, painting mostly portraits and religious subjects. 

==Biography==
Allori was born at Florence and received his first lessons in painting from his father, Alessandro Allori, but becoming dissatisfied with the hard anatomical drawing and cold coloring of the latter, he entered the studio of Gregorio Pagani, who was one of the leaders of the late Florentine school, which sought to unite the rich coloring of the Venetians with the Florentine attention to drawing. Allori also appears to have worked under Cigoli.

When still young he became a court portraitist for the Medicis, though many of his commissions were replicas of portraits by his predecessor Bronzino, or had participation by others.

His pictures are distinguished by their close adherence to nature and the delicacy and technical perfection of their execution. His technical skill is shown by the fact that several copies he made of Correggio&#x27;s works were thought to be duplicates by Correggio himself. His extreme fastidiousness limited the number of his works. Several examples are to be seen at Florence and elsewhere.

His most famous work, in his own day and now, is &quot;Judith with the Head of Holofernes&quot;. It exists in at least two versions by Allori, of which the prime version is perhaps that in the British Royal Collection, dated 1613, with various pentimenti. A version of 1620 in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence is the best known and there are several copies by studio and other hands. There is one copy painted in 1613 in the Vatican Pinacoteca and one in the Gemäldegalerie in Berlin. Strangely, the caption for this copy in Berlin says it may have been painted in 1610 or 1615. Then this copy was painted before the so-called prime version painted in 1613 in the British Royal Collection. (https://www.blindbild.com/berlin-gemaeldegalerie-august-2019/gemaeldegalerie_2019_allori-caravaggio/) According to the near-contemporary biography by Filippo Baldinucci, the model for the Judith was his former mistress, the beautiful &quot;La Mazzafirra&quot; (who is also represented in his Magdalene), the head of Holofernes is a self-portrait, and the maid is the mother of &quot;La Mazzafirra.&quot;

<doc id="446764" wikidata="Q264706" url="?curid=446764" title="Portes du Soleil">
<text>Les Portes du Soleil (, literally &quot;The Doors of the Sun&quot;) is a major skisports destination in the Alps, encompassing twelve resorts between Mont Blanc in France and Lake Geneva in Switzerland. With more than 650 km of marked pistes (claimed by the lift companies; an independent expert measured about 426 km ) and about 200 lifts in total, spread over 14 valleys and about , Portes du Soleil ranks among the two largest ski areas in the world (the other being Les Trois Vallées). Almost all of the pistes are connected by lifts – a few marginal towns can be reached only by the free bus services in the area. The highest elevation accessible on skis is 2260 m (Pointe de Mossettes) and the lowest is 930 m (Abondance Village). 
As with many other Alpine ski resorts, the lower slopes of the Portes du Soleil have snow-making facilities to extend the ski season by keeping the lower slopes open during the warmer months.

The name &quot;Portes du Soleil&quot; originates from the 1,950-meter-high pass of the same name, connecting Morgins to Les Crosets.

== History ==
1934 – During the summer of 1934, the first lift in the Portes du Soleil (The name &#x27;Portes du Soleil&#x27; didn&#x27;t exist then) was constructed. It was the 25-seater Pleney cable car in Morzine. The lift officially opened to the public on December 15, 1934. At the time, Pleney was spelt &#x27;Plenay&#x27; making the official name &#x27;Telepherique du Plenay&#x27;.

1937 – Construction of the &#x27;Boule de Gomme&#x27; draglift in Les Gets. This lift is still operated today making it the oldest current lift in the Portes du Soleil.

1939 – In Champery, the 18-seater Champery - Planchaux cable car was constructed. This was the first cable car in French-speaking Switzerland and only the third of its kind in the entirety of Switzerland.

1947 – The first new development after WWII was the draglift &#x27;Vonnes&#x27; in Chatel.

1950 – A new ski lift in Morgins called &#x27;Morgins - Les Tetes&#x27; is built.

1952 – A gondola is built in the summer of 1952 on Super Morzine with 94, 2-seater open-air cabins. The lift opened in 1953 was only operated until a fire in 1964.

1953 – A chairlift in Chatel is built which goes by the name of &#x27;Chatel - Conche&#x27;. The lift opens up a new area for skiing in Chatel.

1958 – This year saw the construction of the 1-seater chairlift &#x27;Follieuse&#x27; in Morgins which offered skiing on the Savolaire plateau which allowed skiers to enjoy the view of the Dents du Midi.

1960 – Construction of the 35-seater cable car in Morzine, which gave access to the Nyon Plateau.

1963 – On March 17, The Prodains cable car officially entered into service. Each cabin could hold 80 people. 

1965 – The name &#x27;Portes du Soleil&#x27; is officially given the ski area. The name comes from the mountain pass above the resort of Les Crosets.

1967 – The new Avoriaz ski resort was inaugurated on January 8. A month later, on February 4, the &#x27;Chalet-Neuf&#x27; draglift was inaugurated which allowed the connection between Chatel and Morgins. On December 24, the &#x27;La Linga&#x27; Gondola opened which allowed for skiing on the north facing slopes of Chatel.

1969 – The inauguration of two ski lifts between Champery and Avoriaz. These two lifts met at the &#x27;Pas de Chavanette&#x27; which allowed for skiing between the two resorts. The world&#x27;s first international lift pass was used after the opening of this link (Access for Avoriaz - Les Crosets - Champery).

1973 – Construction of a two-seater chairlift with bubbles in St Jean d&#x27;Aulps which allowed for skiing to start on the Grande Terche area.

1975 – Construction of the chairlift &#x27;Plan de Croix - Le Trochey&#x27; which allows access to the Abondance Valley from Torgon.

1976 – The first Portes du Soleil lift pass was used. The resort of Champoussin was also founded.

1977 – Two lifts up to Pointe de L&#x27;Au were constructed allowing for the connection between Les Crosets and Champoussin.

1981 – Construction of the &#x27;Chaux Fleurie&#x27; and &#x27;Rochassons&#x27; chairlifts which made the connection between Avoriaz and Chatel.

1986 – The Chavanette chairlift was destroyed by an avalanche and wouldn&#x27;t open for the rest of the winter. The famous &#x27;Swiss Wall&#x27; run which was serviced by the chairlift was still open however.

1987 – Morzine and Avoriaz were linked by the connection of a gondola, two chairlifts and two ski lifts. A new lift in Torgon allowed the connection between &#x27;Torgon&#x27; and &#x27;Chapelle d&#x27;Abondance&#x27;.

1993 – Europe&#x27;s first detachable 6-seater chairlift &#x27;Tour&#x27; was built in Avoriaz. Also in Avoriaz, the Mossettes chairlift is built allowing the return to the Swiss side of the Portes du Soleil from Lindarets with having to go via &#x27;The Swiss Wall&#x27;.

1999 – The Portes du Soleil is one of the first ski areas in the world to use hands-free lift pass recognition turnstiles.

2008 – On December 6, the first eight-seater chairlift in French-speaking Switzerland entered service. To this day, it is the most efficient ski lift in the Portes du Soleil with a capacity of 4,000 people per hour.

2013 – In April 2013, the new 3S Prodains cable-car is opened 50 years after the original Prodains cable-car.

2015 - On January 17, the Portes du Soleil celebrated its 50th anniversary. The connection between the &#x27;Linga&#x27; and &#x27;Super Chatel&#x27; areas can now be made on skis with the construction of two new lifts that were inaugurated on January 31, 2015.

2017 - The six-seater &#x27;Ranfoilly&#x27; chairlift in Les Gets, which is the fastest chairlift in the Portes du Soleil with an operating speed of 6 m/s, was put into service.

== Resorts ==

There are thirteen resorts in the Portes du Soleil area, of which seven are French and five are Swiss. Most of the resorts have grown around traditional valley villages - only Avoriaz and the very small Les Crosets and Torgon were purposely built during the mid-sixties. Morzine and Chatel are the largest of the traditional towns in the area. As a whole the skiing is relatively low in altitude compared to most French destinations. The highest skiing is just below and the lowest is approximately . However, the area is heavily influenced by the microclimate between Lake Geneva and Mont Blanc, which generates very substantial snowfall between November and April making it possible to keep the area open to skiing typically from early December until mid to late April. Some of the lower stations close around April 1 or earlier depending on snow conditions though.

=== Avoriaz ===
The most modern skiing and accommodation of the Portes du Soleil is the resort of Avoriaz with more than 18.000 beds in 2017. Avoriaz is among the largest purpose-built ski destinations in the world. Avoriaz features purpose-built wood-clad buildings reaching 15 stories and a car-free policy. Avoriaz has extensive offerings for snowboarders and freestyle skiers – 3 major snow parks, border cross, snow cross zones and more. Avoriaz is a hub for a number of summer-activities as well: mountain biking, golf, paragliding, climbing and hiking. There are many restaurants and bars around the area, some also open during the summer.

Morzine is the largest town in the Portes du Soleil area. It is a traditional market town and the town from which the idea of a large connected ski area stems. Morzine has been one of the leading ski destinations in Europe for 80 years, with a large choice of hotels and apartments in Morzine and on the surrounding mountainsides. There are bus services for the Prodains gondola, the Ardent gondola and the Nyon cablecar, while cablecars to Supermorzine (Avoriaz) and to Pleney can be walked to from the town centre. At an altitude of just 950 meters, Morzine offers predominantly easy to medium skiing. Morzine is the most northern of the French Alpine resorts and benefits from the regional microclimate between Mont Blanc and Lake Geneva.

=== Chatel ===

Châtel is a village on the border with Switzerland. The village stretches from Lac de Vonnes (near the border) down to centre. There are 2 main ski areas in the village, Super Châtel is reached by cabincar or chairlift from the centre of town and from here links by lift are made to the Swiss towns of Torgon and Morgins. During the 2014–2015 season new lifts were opened linking Super Chatel with the Linga / Pré La Joux area. This area forms the link between Chatel and Avoriaz and while it is dominated by intermediate and difficult slopes, it is possible to ski all the way to Avoriaz on beginner slopes. Above Pré la Joux lies the small mountain village of Plaine Dranse in which almost all the houses are turned into restaurants. There is also a small church built into the rock. The resort of Chatel lies at 1200 m and the highest point of skiing is about 2200 m.

=== Les Gets ===
Les Gets is an alpine village situated on the Col des Gets between Morzine and Taninges at an altitude of 1172m with a year-round population of around 1,300 people. The resort is popular among families with many gentle runs at the top of the Chavannes gondola. The ski area in Les Gets ranges from an altitude of 950m to 2000m and is serviced by many modern lifts.

=== Morgins ===
Morgins forms part of the Swiss section of Portes du Soleil and is not as crowded as the larger resorts in France. The skiing is linked to Chatel on one side of the village and to Champoussin to the other side. As one of the lower resorts with shallow runs, Morgins is among the first to close connections to other areas when the snow melts in spring. The skiing in Morgins is comparatively easy, many of the lifts are draglifts.

=== Les Crosets ===
Les Crosets is a very small resort in the Portes Du Soleil located in Switzerland. It can be reached by ski from Morgins and Avoriaz. It allows views of the Dents Du Midi and has a large funpark. A famous steep black itinerary piste nicknamed The Swiss Wall (a steep mogul run) can be reached from Les Crosets. There are three top stations connecting to Avoriaz – Pointe de Mossette, Grand-Conche, and Chavanette. Les Crosets is built above the village of Champery. The two stations are connected by the Champéry-Plancachaux cable car. There are no pistes connecting Les Crosets to Champery. Skiers have to either go down by cablecar or ski down to Grand Paradis and continue by car or shuttle bus.

=== Champery ===
Champery is a Swiss village situated at an altitude of approximately 1050 meters, nestled at the base of the Dents du Midi and the Dents Blanches, at the end of the Vallée d’Illiez. It is a 150 years old village which was among the initiating towns when the Portes du Soleil ski area was established in the late Sixties. There are no pistes leading all the way down to Champery due in part to the fact that the mountainside above the town is heavily exposed to snow. The Champéry – Planachaux cable-car (125 passengers) and the 6-seater chairlift in Grand-Paradis are fast connections into the Portes du Soleil system.

=== Torgon ===
Torgon is a purpose-built ski resort and is known by locals as the &quot;Balcon du Chablais&quot;. The resort is situated at an altitude of 1085m. Skiing can be done here as low as 1150m altitude with the Fingards drag lift. Torgon is small resort which serves as the link between the two French resorts of Châtel and La Chapelle dʼAbondance and therefore plays a role within the Portes du Soleil of linking these two resorts. Torgon also has views of Lake Geneva and the Dents du Midi.

=== La Chapelle d&#x27;Abondance ===
La Chapelle d&#x27;Abondance is a savoyard village which is located 1000m above sea level in the Abondance valley, between other local tourist destinations, such as Châtel and Abondance. The village has two ski areas: Crêt Béni and Braitaz.

Skiing in La Chapelle d&#x27;Abondance is done on both sides of the valley. The historic side is that of Crêt-Béni, which is north-facing and dominated by the Mount Grange at an altitude of 2432m above sea level. The first ski lift was built there in the 1970s. The ski area on this side of the valley can be accessed directly from the village center. On the other side of the valley is Braitaz ski area, built in 1987. It provides the connection on skis from La Chapelle d&#x27;Abondance to most other Portes du Soleil resorts.

=== Champoussin ===
Located in the &#x27;Val d&#x27;Illiez&#x27;, in the Valais canton of Switzerland is the ski resort of Champoussin. Situated at an altitude of 1600m, the village and resort of Champoussin is on a plateau facing the Dents du Midi. Champoussin is located between the Swiss ski resorts of Les Crosets and Morgins which are also in the Portes du Soleil.

=== Saint Jean d&#x27;Aulps ===
Saint-Jean-dʼAulps is a small town located at around 800m altitude in the Vallée d&#x27;Aulps. The ski area of the town is named &#x27;l’Espace Roc d&#x27;Enfer&#x27;, after the nearby mountain that dominates the landscape, and is linked with the neighbouring resort of La Chèvrerie (Bellevaux). Although not connected by skis, the Roc dʼEnfer area is commercially attached to the Portes du Soleil area and there are shuttle buses to access Morzine, Les Gets and Avoriaz in winter. The skiing here is between 900m and 1800m. There are also plans to link up the ski area here with the nearby town of Les Gets.

<text>Electro (or electro-funk, sometimes called electro-pop) is a genre of electronic dance music directly influenced by the use of the Roland TR-808 drum machines, with an immediate origin in early hip hop and funk genres. Records in the genre typically feature heavy electronic sounds, usually without vocals; if vocals are present, they are delivered in a deadpan manner, often through electronic distortion such as vocoding and talkboxing. It palpably deviates from its predecessor boogie by being less vocal-oriented and more focused on electronic beats produced by drum machines.

Following the decline of disco music in the United States, electro emerged as a fusion of funk and early hip hop with principal influences from New York boogie, and German and Japanese electronic pop music. The genre emerged with musicians Arthur Baker, Afrika Bambaataa, Warp 9, and Hashim. Seminal electro tracks included &quot;Planet Rock&quot; (1982) and &quot;Nunk&quot; (1982), both featuring its characteristic TR-808 drum beats.

The early 1980s were electro&#x27;s mainstream peak. By the mid-1980s, the genre moved away from its electronic and funk influences, using harder edged beats and rock samples, exemplified by Run DMC. Electro became popular again in the late 1990s with artists such as Anthony Rother and DJs such as Dave Clarke. A third wave of popularity occurred in 2007. Electro has branched out into subgenres, including electrocore and skweee.

==Definition and characteristics==
From its inception, one of the defining characteristics of the electro sound was the use of drum machines, particularly the Roland TR-808, as the rhythmic basis of the track. As the genre evolved, computers and sampling replaced drum machines in electronic music, and are now used by the majority of electro producers. It is important to note, that although the electro of the 1980s and contemporary electro (electronic dance music) both grew out of the dissolution of disco, they are now different genres.

Classic (1980s) electro drum patterns tend to be electronic emulations of breakbeats with a syncopated kick drum, and usually a snare or clap accenting the backbeat. The difference between electro drumbeats and breakbeats (or breaks) is that electro tends to be more mechanical, while breakbeats tend to have more of a human-like feel, like that of a live drummer. The definition however is somewhat ambiguous in nature due to the various uses of the term.

The Roland TR-808 drum machine was released in 1980, defining early electro with its immediately recognizable sound. Staccato, percussive drumbeats tended to dominate electro, almost exclusively provided by the TR-808. As an inexpensive way of producing a drum sound, the TR-808 caught on quickly with the producers of early electro because of the ability of its bass drum to generate extreme low-frequencies. This aspect of the Roland TR-808 was especially appealing to producers who would test drive their tracks in nightclubs (like NYC&#x27;s Funhouse), where the bass drum sound was essential for a record&#x27;s success. Its unique percussion sounds like handclaps, open and closed high-hat, clave and cowbell became integral to the electro sound. A number of popular songs in the early 1980s employed the TR-808, including Marvin Gaye&#x27;s “Sexual Healing,” Cybotron&#x27;s “Clear,” and Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s “Planet Rock.” The Roland TR-808 has attained iconic status, eventually being used on more hits than any other drum machine. Through the use of samples, the Roland TR-808 remains popular in electro and other genres to the present day.

Other electro instrumentation was generally electronic, favoring analog synthesis, programmed bass lines, sequenced or arpeggiated synthetic riffs, and atonal sound effects all created with synthesizers. Heavy use of effects such as reverbs, delays, chorus or phasers along with eerie synthetic ensemble strings or pad sounds emphasized the science fiction or futuristic themes of classic (1980s) electro, represented in the lyrics and/or music. Electro hip hop group Warp 9&#x27;s 1983 single, Light Years Away, produced and written by Lotti Golden and Richard Scher, exemplifies the Sci-Fi, afrofuturist aspect of electro, reflected in both the lyrics and instrumentation. The imagery of its lyrical refrain &quot;space is the place for the human race&quot; pays homage to Sun Ra&#x27;s 1974 film of the same name, while its synth lines and sound effects are informed by sci-fi, computer games, and cartoons,&quot;born of a science-fiction revival.&quot;.

Most electro is instrumental, but a common element is vocals processed through a vocoder. Additionally, speech synthesis may be used to create robotic or mechanical lyrical content, as in the iconic Planet Rock and the automatous chant in the chorus of Nunk by Warp 9. Although primarily instrumental, early electro utilized rap. Male rap dominated the genre, however female rappers are an integral part of the electro tradition, whether featured in a group as in Warp 9 or as solo performers like Roxanne Shante. The lyrical style that emerged along with electro became less popular by the 1990s, as rapping continued to evolve, becoming the domain of hip hop music.

About electro origins:

==History==

Following the decline of disco music in the late 1970s, various funk artists such as Zapp began experimenting with talk boxes and the use of heavier, more distinctive beats. Boogie played a role during the formative years of electro, notably &quot;Feels Good&quot; by Electra (Emergency – EMDS-6527), the post-disco production &quot;You&#x27;re the One for Me&quot; by D. Train (Prelude – PRL D 621), and the Eric Matthew/Darryl Payne productions &quot;Thanks to You&quot; by Sinnamon (Becket – BKD 508), and &quot;On A Journey (I Sing The Funk Electric)&quot; by Electrik Funk (Prelude – PRL D 541). Electro eventually emerged as a fusion of different styles, including funk, boogie combined with German and Japanese technopop, in addition to influences from the futurism of Alvin Toffler, martial arts films, and video game music. The genre&#x27;s immediate forebears included Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO).

In 1980, YMO was the first band to utilize the TR-808 programmable drum machine. That same year, YMO member Ryuichi Sakamoto released &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;, which is regarded as an early example of electro music, and is credited for having anticipated the beats and sounds of electro. The song&#x27;s influence can be seen in the work of later pioneering electro artists such as Afrika Bambaataa and Mantronix.

Electro experienced a watershed year in 1982. Bronx based producer Afrika Bambaataa released the seminal track &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, which contained elements of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; (from the album of the same name) and &quot;Numbers&quot; (from Kraftwerk&#x27;s 1981 &quot;Computer World&quot; album) combined with the use of distinctive TR-808 beats. &quot;Planet Rock&quot; is widely regarded as a turning point in the electro genre, &quot;like a light being switched on.&quot; Another groundbreaking record released that year, Nunk by Warp 9 utilized &quot;imagery drawn from computer games and hip hop slanguage.&quot; Although remaining unreleased, a pre-Def Jam Russell Simmons produced Bruce Haack&#x27;s proto hip-hop single &quot;Party Machine&quot; at a studio in Philadelphia. Electro hip hop releases in 1982 include songs by: Planet Patrol, Warp 9, Man Parrish, George Clinton (&quot;Computer Games&quot;), Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Tyrone Brunson, The Jonzun Crew and Whodini.

In 1983, Hashim created the influential electro funk tune &quot;Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)&quot; which became Cutting Record&#x27;s first release in November 1983. At the time Hashim was influenced by Man Parrish&#x27;s &quot;Hip Hop, Be Bop&quot;, Thomas Dolby&#x27;s &quot;She Blinded Me With Science&quot; and Afrika Bambaataa&#x27;s &quot;Planet Rock&quot;. &quot;Al-Nafyish&quot; was later included in Playgroup&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Kings of Electro&quot; (2007), alongside other electro classics such as Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;. Also in 1983, Herbie Hancock, in collaboration with Grand Mixer D.ST, released the hit single &quot;Rockit&quot;.

Bambaataa and groups like Planet Patrol, Jonzun Crew, Mantronix, Newcleus, Warp 9 and Juan Atkins&#x27; Detroit-based group Cybotron went on to influence the genres of Detroit techno, ghettotech, breakbeat, drum and bass and electroclash. Early producers in the electro genre (notably Arthur Baker, John Robie and Shep Pettibone) later featured prominently in the Latin Freestyle (or simply &quot;Freestyle&quot;) movement, along with Lotti Golden and Richard Scher (the producer/writers of Warp 9) fusing electro, funk, and hip hop with elements of Latin music.

By the late 1980s, the genre evolved into what is known today as new school hip hop. The release of Run DMC&#x27;s It&#x27;s Like That (1983) marked a stylistic shift, focusing down on the beats in a stark, metal minimalism. Rock samples replaced synthesizers that had figured so prominently in electro, and rap styles and techniques evolved in tandem, anchoring rap to the changing hip hop culture. 
Baker, Pettibone, Golden and Scher enjoyed robust careers well into the house era, eluding the &quot;genre trap&quot; to successfully produce mainstream artists.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Detroit Techno musicians James Stinson and Gerald Donald released numerous EPs, singles and albums of conceptual electro music under several different aliases. Their main project, Drexciya is known for exploration of science fiction and aquatic themes.

Electro music inspired by the electro revival in the UK during the mid 90&#x27;s is often cited as neo electro, however it is simply a term and not a genre. 

== Electro-soul ==
In the early 1980s, Detroit techno DJ Eddie Fowlkes shaped a related style called electro-soul, which was characterized by a predominant bass line and a chopped up electro breakbeat contrasted with soulful male vocals. Kurtis Mantronik&#x27;s electro-soul productions for Joyce Sims presaged new jack swing&#x27;s combination of hip hop and soul elements. In a 2016 profile on the genre&#x27;s rise in Denver&#x27;s music scene, Dylan Owens of &quot;The Denver Post&quot; writes, &quot;As with all fledgling genres, little about electro-soul is defined — even what to call it. (Of the eight artists interviewed for this article, none agreed on any one name.) But what does seem sure is its rise, especially locally. If Denver can be known as the musical torchbearer of any genre, it&#x27;s electro-soul&#x27;s half-live, half-produced swirl of hip-hop, soul, funk and jazz.&quot;

&quot;No Self Control&quot; by Peter Gabriel, taken from his 1980 self-titled album, has been described as electro-soul, fused with art rock.

==Contemporary electro==

Although the early 1980s were electro&#x27;s heyday in the mainstream, it enjoyed renewed popularity in the late 1990s with artists such as Anthony Rother and DJs such as Dave Clarke. The genre has made yet another comeback for a third wave of popularity in 2007. The continued interest in electro, though influenced to a great degree by Florida, Detroit, Miami, Los Angeles and New York styles, has primarily taken hold in Florida and Europe with electro club nights becoming commonplace again. The scene still manages to support hundreds of electro labels, from the disco electro of Clone Records, to the old school b-boy styles of Breakin’ Records and Dominance Electricity, to the electrofunk of Citinite, and to harder more modern styles of electro of labels like Bass Frequency Productions and Nu Illusion Music.

New branches of electro have risen over the last couple of years. Florida has pioneered the &quot;Electrocore&quot; sound, started in the late 1990s by artists like Jackal and Hyde and Dynamix II and carried on to this day. Skweee is a genre which developed in Nordic countries such as Sweden and Finland, hence its first name &quot;Scandinavian Funk&quot;. The outlets and artists of Skweee are still mostly limited to the Nordic countries.

Starting in the late 1990s, the term &quot;electro&quot; is also used to refer two other fusion genres of electro, either blended with techno and new wave in electroclash. In 2006, Direct Influence, a six-piece Melbourne based electro/rock/reggae group was formed.

The genre enjoyed a resurgence starting in 2016, with DJs like Helena Hauff and DJ Stingray gaining more popularity and festivals like Dekmantel featuring it prominently on their lineups. Labels like Cultivated Electronics, CPU, Mars Frequency Records, Furatena, brokntoys and Mechatronica are currently pushing a new trove of artists which has introduced the genre to a new generation.

<text>The emerging church, sometimes wrongly equated with the &quot;emergent movement&quot; or &quot;emergent conversation&quot;, is a Christian movement of the late 20th and early 21st century. Emerging churches can be found around the globe, predominantly in North America, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. Members come from a number of Christian traditions. Some attend local independent churches or house churches while others worship in traditional Christian denominations. 
The emerging church favors the use of simple story and narrative. Members of the movement often place a high value on good works or social activism, including missional living. Proponents of the movement believe it transcends labels such as &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;; it is sometimes called a &quot;conversation&quot; to emphasize its developing and decentralized nature, its range of standpoints, and commitment to dialogue. Participants seek to live their faith in what they believe to be a &quot;postmodern&quot; society. Disillusionment with the organized and institutional church has led participants to support the deconstruction of modern Christian worship and evangelism, and the nature of modern Christian community.

== Definitions and terminology==
Participants in the movement may be Protestant, post-Protestant, Catholic, or evangelical post-evangelical, liberal Christian, post-liberal, conservative, and post-conservative, anabaptist, adventist, reformed, charismatic, neocharismatic, and post-charismatic. Proponents, however, believe the movement transcends such &quot;modernist&quot; labels of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal,&quot; calling the movement a &quot;conversation&quot; to emphasize its developing and decentralized nature, its vast range of standpoints, and its commitment to dialogue. Participants seek to live their faith in what they believe to be a &quot;postmodern&quot; society. What those involved in the conversation mostly agree on is their disillusionment with the organized and institutional church and their support for the deconstruction of modern Christian worship, modern evangelism, and the nature of modern Christian community.

Some have noted a difference between the terms &quot;emerging&quot; and &quot;Emergent&quot;. While &quot;emerging&quot; is a wider, informal, church-based, global movement, &quot;Emergent&quot; refers to a specific, structured organization, the Emergent Village, associated with Brian McLaren, and has also been called the &quot;Emergent stream&quot;.

Key themes of the emerging church are couched in the language of reform, Christian praxis-oriented lifestyles, post-evangelical thought, and incorporation or acknowledgment of Christian political and postmodern Christian elements. Many of the movement&#x27;s participants use terminology that originates from postmodern literary theory, social network theory, narrative theology, and other related fields.

Stuart Murray states:
Ian Mobsby observes:
===Similar labels===
Although some emergent thinkers such as Brian McLaren and other Christian scholars such as D. A. Carson use &quot;emerging&quot; and &quot;emergent&quot; as synonyms, a large number of participants in the emerging church movement maintain a distinction between them. The term &quot;emergent church&quot; was coined in 1981 by Catholic political theologian, Johann Baptist Metz for use in a different context. &quot;Emergent&quot; is sometimes more closely associated with Emergent Village. Those participants in the movement who assert this distinction believe &quot;emergents&quot; and &quot;emergent village&quot; to be a part of the emerging church movement but prefer to use the term &quot;emerging church&quot; to refer to the movement as a whole while using the term &quot;emergent&quot; in a more limited way, referring to Brian McLaren and Emergent Village.

Many of those within the emerging church movement who do not closely identify with &quot;emergent village&quot; tend to avoid that organization&#x27;s interest in radical theological reformulation and focus more on new ways of &quot;doing church&quot; and expressing their spirituality. Mark Driscoll and Scot McKnight have now voiced concerns over Brian McLaren and the &quot;emergent thread.&quot; Other evangelical leaders such as Shane Claiborne have also come to distance himself from the emerging church movement, its labels and the &quot;emergent brand&quot;.

Some observers consider the &quot;emergent stream&quot; to be one major part within the larger emerging church movement. This may be attributed to the stronger voice of the &#x27;emergent&#x27; stream found in the US which contrasts the more subtle and diverse development of the movement in the UK, Australia and New Zealand over a longer period of time. In the US, some Roman Catholics have also begun to describe themselves as being part of the emergent conversation. As a result of the above factors, the use of correct vocabulary to describe a given participant in this movement can occasionally be awkward, confusing, or controversial. Key voices in the movement have been identified with Emergent Village, thus the rise of the nomenclature &quot;emergent&quot; to describe participants in the movement.

Marcus Borg defines the term &quot;emerging paradigm&quot; in his 2003 book &quot;The Heart of Christianity&quot;. He writes Borg provides a compact summary of this &quot;emerging paradigm&quot; as: 

== History ==
Although the history is little known in the US, there was a strong current of emerging churches in the UK and elsewhere that preceded the US Emergent organization. This began with Mike Riddell and Mark Pierson in New Zealand from 1989, and with a number of practitioners in the UK including Jonny Baker, Ian Mobsby, Kevin, Ana and Brian Draper, and Sue Wallace amongst others, from around 1992. The influence of the Nine O&#x27;Clock Service has is generally unacknowledged—perhaps owing to the abuse by its leader which led to the group&#x27;s demise—yet much that was practised there was influential on early proponents of alternative worship. The US organization emerged in the late 1990s.

What is common to the identity of many of these emerging church projects that began in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, is that they developed with very little central planning on behalf of the established denominations. They occurred as the initiative of particular groups wanting to start new contextual church experiments, and are therefore very &#x27;bottom up&#x27;. Murray says that these churches began in a spontaneous way, with informal relationships formed between otherwise independent groups and that many became churches as a development from their initial more modest beginnings.

==Values and characteristics==

===Trinitarian-based values===
Gibbs and Bolger interviewed a number of people involved in leading emerging churches and from this research have identified some core values in the emerging church, including desires to imitate the life of Jesus; transform secular society; emphasise communal living; welcome outsiders; be generous and creative; and lead without control. Ian Mobsby suggests Trinitarian ecclesiology is the basis of these shared international values.

Mobsby also suggests that the emerging church is centred on a combination of models of church and of contextual theology that draw on this Trinitarian base: the Mystical Communion and Sacramental models of church, and the Synthetic and Transcendent models of contextual theology.

According to Mobsby, the emerging church has reacted to the missional needs of postmodern culture and re-acquired a Trinitarian basis to its understanding of church as worship, mission and community. He argues this movement is over and against some forms of conservative evangelicalism and other reformed ecclesiologies since the enlightenment that have neglected the Trinity, which has caused problems with certainty, judgementalism and fundamentalism and the increasing gap between the church and contemporary culture.

===Post-Christendom mission and evangelism===
According to Stuart Murray, Christendom is the creation and maintenance of a Christian nation by ensuring a close relationship of power between the Christian church and its host culture. Today, churches may still attempt to use this power in mission and evangelism. The emerging church considers this to be unhelpful. Murray summarizes Christendom values as: a commitment to hierarchy and the status quo; the loss of lay involvement; institutional values rather than community focus; church at the centre of society rather than the margins; the use of political power to bring in the Kingdom; religious compulsion; punitive rather than restorative justice; marginalisation of women, the poor, and dissident movements; inattentiveness to the criticisms of those outraged by the historic association of Christianity with patriarchy, warfare, injustice and patronage; partiality for respectability and top-down mission; attractional evangelism; assuming the Christian story is known; and a preoccupation with the rich and powerful. 

The emerging church seeks a post-Christendom approach to being church and mission through: renouncing imperialistic approaches to language and cultural imposition; making &#x27;truth claims&#x27; with humility and respect; overcoming the public/private dichotomy; moving church from the center to the margins; moving from a place of privilege in society to one voice amongst many; a transition from control to witness, maintenance to mission and institution to movement.

While some Evangelicals emphasize eternal salvation, many in the emerging church emphasize the here and now. In the face of criticism, some in the emerging church respond that it is important to attempt a &quot;both and&quot; approach to redemptive and incarnational theologies. Some Evangelicals and Fundamentalists are perceived as &quot;overly redemptive&quot; and therefore in danger of condemning people by communicating the gospel in aggressive and angry ways. A more loving and affirming approach is proposed in the context of post-modernity where distrust may occur in response to power claims. It is suggested that this can form the basis of a constructive engagement with 21st-century post-industrial western cultures. According to Ian Mobsby, the suggestion that the emerging church is mainly focused on deconstruction and the rejection of current forms of church should itself be rejected.
===Postmodernism and hermeneutics===
The emerging church is a response to the perceived influence of modernism in Western Christianity. As some sociologists commented on a cultural shift that they believed to correspond to postmodern ways of perceiving reality in the late 20th century, some Christians began to advocate changes within the church in response. These Christians saw the contemporary church as being culturally bound to modernism. They changed their practices to relate to the new cultural situation. Emerging Christians began to challenge the modern church on issues such as: institutional structures, systematic theology, propositional teaching methods, a perceived preoccupation with buildings, an attractional understanding of mission, professional clergy, and a perceived preoccupation with the political process and unhelpful jargon (&quot;Christianese&quot;).

As a result, some in the emerging church believe it is necessary to deconstruct modern Christian dogma. One way this happens is by engaging in dialogue, rather than proclaiming a predigested message, believing that this leads people to Jesus through the Holy Spirit on their own terms. Many in the movement embrace the missiology that drives the movement in an effort to be like Christ and make disciples by being a good example. The emerging church movement contains a great diversity in beliefs and practices, although some have adopted a preoccupation with sacred rituals, good works, and political and social activism. Much of the Emerging Church movement has also adopted the approach to evangelism which stressed peer-to-peer dialogue rather than dogmatic proclamation and proselytizing.

A plurality of Scriptural interpretations is acknowledged in the emerging church movement. Participants in the movement exhibit a particular concern for the effect of the modern &quot;reader&#x27;s&quot; cultural context on the act of interpretation echoing the ideas of postmodern thinkers such as Jacques Derrida and Stanley Fish. Therefore a narrative approach to Scripture, and history are emphasized in some emerging churches over exegetical and dogmatic approaches (such as that found in systematic theology and systematic exegesis), which are often viewed as reductionist. Others embrace a multiplicity of approaches.

===Generous orthodoxy===
Some emerging church leaders see interfaith dialogue a means to share their narratives as they learn from the narratives of others. Some Emerging Church Christians believe there are radically diverse perspectives within Christianity that are valuable for humanity to progress toward truth and a better resulting relationship with God, and that these different perspectives deserve Christian charity rather than condemnation.

===Centered set===
The movement appropriates set theory as a means of understanding a basic change in the way the Christian church thinks about itself as a group. &quot;Set theory&quot; is a concept in mathematics that allows an understanding of what numbers belong to a group, or set. A bounded set would describe a group with clear &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; definitions of membership. The Christian church has largely organized itself as a bounded set, those who share the same beliefs and values are in the set and those who disagree are outside.

The centered set does not limit membership to pre-conceived boundaries. Instead, a centered set is conditioned on a centered point. Membership is contingent on those who are moving toward that point. Elements moving toward a particular point are part of the set, but elements moving away from that point are not. As a centered-set Christian membership would be dependent on moving toward the central point of Jesus. A Christian is then defined by their focus and movement toward Christ rather than a limited set of shared beliefs and values.

John Wimber utilized the centered-set understanding of membership in his Vineyard Churches. The centered set theory of Christian churches came largely from missional anthropologist Paul Hiebert. The centered-set understanding of membership allows for a clear vision of the focal point, the ability to move toward that point without being tied down to smaller diversions, a sense of total egalitarianism with respect for differing opinions, and an authority moved from individual members to the existing center.

===Authenticity and conversation===
The movement favors the sharing of experiences via testimonies, prayer, group recitation, sharing meals and other communal practices, which they believe are more personal and sincere than propositional presentations of the Gospel. Teachers in the emerging church tend to view the Bible and its stories through a lens which they believe finds significance and meaning for their community&#x27;s social and personal stories rather than for the purpose of finding cross-cultural, propositional absolutes regarding salvation and conduct.

The emerging church claims they are creating a safe environment for those with opinions ordinarily rejected within modern conservative evangelicalism and fundamentalism. Non-critical, interfaith dialog is preferred over dogmatically-driven evangelism in the movement. Story and narrative replaces the dogmatic:

Those in the movement do not engage in aggressive apologetics or confrontational evangelism in the traditional sense, preferring to encourage the freedom to discover truth through conversation and relationships with the Christian community.

===Missional living===

Participants in this movement assert that the incarnation of Christ informs their theology. They believe that as God entered the world in human form, adherents enter (individually and communally) into the context around them and aim to transform that culture through local involvement. This holistic involvement may take many forms, including social activism, hospitality and acts of kindness. This beneficent involvement in culture is part of what is called missional living. Missional living leads to a focus on temporal and social issues, in contrast with a perceived evangelical overemphasis on salvation.

Drawing on research and models of contextual theology, Mobsby asserts that the emerging church is using different models of contextual theology than conservative evangelicals, who tend to use a &quot;translation&quot; model of contextual theology (which has been criticized for being colonialist and condescending toward other cultures); the emerging church tends to use a &quot;synthetic&quot; or &quot;transcendent&quot; model of contextual theology. The emerging church has charged many conservative evangelical churches with withdrawal from involvement in contextual mission and seeking the contextualization of the gospel.

Many emerging churches have put a strong emphasis on contextualization and, therefore, contextual theology. Contextual theology has been defined as &quot;A way of doing theology in which one takes into account: the spirit and message of the gospel; the tradition of the Christian people; the culture in which one is theologising; and social change in that culture.&quot; Emerging churches, drawing on this synthetic (or transcendent) model of contextual theology, seek to have a high view towards the Bible, the Christian people, culture, humanity and justice. It is this &quot;both ... and&quot; approach that distinguishes contextual theology.

Emerging communities participate in social action, community involvement, global justice and sacrificial hospitality in an effort to know and share God&#x27;s grace. At a conference entitled &quot;The Emerging Church Forum&quot; in 2006, John Franke said: &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ is not the goal of the Gospel, just the instrument of the extension of God&#x27;s mission&quot;, and: &quot;The Church has been slow to recognize that missions a program the Church administers, it is the very core of the Church&#x27;s reason for being.&quot; This focus on missional living and practicing radical hospitality has led many emerging churches to deepen what they are doing by developing a rhythm of life, and a vision of missional loving engagement with the world.
===Communitarian or egalitarian ecclesiology===
Proponents of the movement communicate and interact through fluid and open networks because the movement is decentralized with little institutional coordination. Because of the participation values named earlier, being community through participation affects the governance of most emerging churches. Participants avoid power relationships, attempting to gather in ways specific to their local context. In this way some in the movement share with the house church movements a willingness to challenge traditional church structures/organizations though they also respect the different expressions of traditional Christian denominations.

International research suggests that some emerging churches are utilizing a Trinitarian basis to being church through what Avery Dulles calls &#x27;The Mystical Communion Model of Church&#x27;.
* Not an institution but a sorority.
* Church as interpersonal community.
* Church as a sisterhood of individual congregations (unified bride of Christ), and as a fellowship of people in family with God and with one another (brothers and sisters) in Christ.
* Connects strongly with the mystical &#x27;body of Christ&#x27; as a communion of the spiritual life of faith, hope and charity.
* Resonates with Aquinas&#x27; notion of the Church as the principle of unity that dwells in Christ and in us, binding us together and in him.
* All the external means of grace, (sacraments, scripture, laws etc.) are secondary and subordinate; their role is simply to dispose people for an interior union with God effected by grace.

Dulles sees the strength in this approach being acceptable to both Protestant and Catholic:

===Creative and rediscovered spirituality===
This can involve everything from expressive, neocharismatic style of worship and the use of contemporary music and films to more ancient liturgical customs and eclectic expressions of spirituality, with the goal of making the church gathering reflect the local community&#x27;s tastes.

Emerging church practitioners are happy to take elements of worship from a wide variety of historic traditions, including traditions of the Catholic, Anglican and Eastern Orthodox Churches, and Celtic Christianity. From these and other religious traditions emerging church groups take, adapt and blend various historic church practices including liturgy, prayer beads, icons, spiritual direction, the labyrinth, and . The emerging church is also sometimes called the &quot;Ancient-Future&quot; church.

One of the key social drives in Western post-industrialised countries, is the rise in new-&quot;old&quot; forms of mysticism. This rise in spirituality appears to be driven by the effects of consumerism, globalisation and advances in information technology. Therefore, the emerging church is operating in a new context of postmodern spirituality, as a new form of mysticism. This capitalizes on the social shift in starting assumptions from the situation that most are regarded as materialist/atheist (the modern position), to the fact that many people now believe in and are searching for something more spiritual (postmodern view). This has been characterised as a major shift from religion to spirituality.

In the new world of &#x27;spiritual tourism&#x27;, the Emerging Church Movement is seeking to missionally assist people to shift from being spiritual tourists to Christian pilgrims. Many are drawing on ancient Christian resources recontextualised into the contemporary such as contemplation and contemplative forms of prayer, symbolic multi-sensory worship, story telling and many others. This again has required a change in focus as the majority of unchurched and dechurched people are seeking &#x27;something that works&#x27; rather than something that is &#x27;true&#x27;.

===Morality and justice===
Drawing on a more &#x27;missional morality&#x27; that again turns to the synoptic gospels of Christ, many emerging-church groups draw on an understanding of God seeking to restore all things back into restored relationship. This emphasises God&#x27;s graceful love approach to discipleship, in following Christ who identified with the socially excluded and ill, in opposition to the Pharisees and Sadducees and their purity rules.

Under this movement, traditional Christians&#x27; emphasis on either individual salvation, end-times theology or the prosperity gospel have been challenged. Many people in the movement express concern for what they consider to be the practical manifestation of God&#x27;s kingdom on earth, by which they mean social justice. This concern manifests itself in a variety of ways depending on the local community and in ways they believe transcend &quot;modernist&quot; labels of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal.&quot; This concern for justice is expressed in such things as feeding the poor, visiting the sick and prisoners, stopping contemporary slavery, critiquing systemic and coercive power structures with &quot;postcolonial hermeneutics,&quot; and working for environmental causes.

<doc id="446783" wikidata="Q3116214" url="?curid=446783" title="Greg Dyke">
<text>Gregory Dyke (born 20 May 1947) is a British media executive, football administrator, journalist and broadcaster. Since the 1960s, Dyke has had a long career in the UK in print and then broadcast journalism. He is credited with introducing &quot;tabloid&quot; television to British broadcasting, and reviving the ratings of TV-am. In the 1990s, he held chief executive positions at LWT Group, Pearson Television, and Channel 5.

Dyke was director-general of the BBC from January 2000 to January 2004; he resigned following heavy criticism of the BBC&#x27;s news reporting process in the Hutton Inquiry. He was also a director of Manchester United and chairman of Brentford football clubs, and from 2013 to 2016 was chairman of the Football Association. He was chancellor of the University of York from 2004 to 2015 and chairman of the British Film Institute between 2008 and 2016. He is currently the chairman of children&#x27;s television company HiT Entertainment, and is a panellist on Sky News&#x27;s &quot;The Pledge&quot;.

Since 2016, Dyke has been vice president for television of BAFTA. In 2018, he became chairman of London Film School.

==Early life and education==

Greg Dyke was born in 1947, in Hayes, Middlesex, the youngest of three sons in a &quot;stable, lower middle class&quot; family. His father was an insurance salesman. The family lived at 17 Cerne Close until Dyke was nine years old, then moved to Cedars Drive, Hillingdon. He was educated at Yeading Primary School and then Hayes Grammar School, which he left with one grade &quot;E&quot; at A-level mathematics. After school, he was briefly a trainee manager at Marks &amp; Spencer, before leaving to work as a trainee reporter for the &quot;Hillingdon Mirror&quot;, becoming chief reporter in eight months. He left the &quot;Mirror&quot; after attempting to stage a union-backed protest against poor pay conditions by the junior staff on the paper. He then got a job at the &quot;Slough Evening Mail&quot;. Among his colleagues was future music journalist Colin Irwin.

Dyke then went on to study for a degree at the University of York as a mature student, graduating in 1974 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in politics. During his time at York, Dyke was active in student politics, and was part of a collective that produced a psychedelic underground student magazine called &quot;Nouse&quot;. He also met and married his first wife, Christine Taylor, whilst at the university. His contemporaries and friends at York included future journalists Linda Grant and Peter Hitchens, the latter then active in the International Socialists. Dyke was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university in 1999 and was chancellor from 2004 to 2015.

==Career==

===Break into television: LWT and TV-AM===
After university, Dyke followed his first wife to Newcastle. He had become disillusioned with newspaper journalism, and tried for a job as a junior reporter at BBC Radio Teesside. He was unsuccessful, apparently because the interviewers felt no-one would understand his accent. Dyke instead found work covering rural affairs for the &quot;Newcastle Journal&quot;. He moved back to London with Christine in 1974 to become campaign officer for the Wandsworth Community Relations Council. He hated the job and left to campaign to be elected GLC Councillor for Putney. Again he was unsuccessful.

Dyke was given assistance getting a job at London Weekend Television (LWT) by fellow ex-Newcastle journalist Nicholas Evans, who was at the time working on &quot;Weekend World&quot;. Dyke got a junior position on LWT&#x27;s local politics programme, in the current affairs department. His bosses there were John Birt and Peter Jay. He attracted attention for trying to give the programmes he worked on a more populist edge. This led to him being given the chance to launch a new early evening current affairs topical news programme. This became &quot;The Six O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, fronted by Michael Aspel, with co-hosts Danny Baker and Janet Street-Porter. The show is seen by many as the first example of British tabloid TV.

After the success of &quot;The Six O&#x27; Clock Show&quot;, Dyke was brought in by Jonathan Aitken to become programme director at ailing station TV-am in April 1983. The station was doing very badly in the ratings compared to the BBC&#x27;s popular &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; magazine style programme. He was instrumental in reviving the breakfast show&#x27;s fortunes by introducing a new schedule based around popular features including bingo, celebrity gossip and horoscopes.

Dyke left TV-am, in May 1984 after Bruce Gyngell was brought in to enhance and improve the company to allow it to be financially viable. Ten days later, Michael Moor, the TV-am general manager, also left the station. In August 1984, Dyke became director of programmes at Television South (TVS).

In April 1987, Dyke moved from TVS to LWT again to be director of programmes, replacing John Birt, having originally worked at LWT in 1978. At the same time, he helped LWT re-sectioning the company in a bid to cut costs and overhaul the working practices within the company ahead of a new franchise period, which it won. Dyke was responsible for cancelling ITV&#x27;s coverage of professional wrestling in 1988. In 1992 he was appointed the chairman of the ITV Council, and LWT chief executive. In February 1993 he was appointed chairman of the GMTV board and tasked with overhauling the station format, which included &quot;more popular journalism&quot;. His role was primarily to bring new and imaginative ideas to the station without taking on full day-to-day running. In 1994, he made a fortune when Granada bought out LWT.

===Pearson and Channel 5===
Dyke became chairman and chief executive of Pearson Television in January 1995, and began expanding the company. His first acquisition was Grundy Television which helped build Pearson into the biggest non-US independent production company in the world.

At the end of October 1995 a consortium guided by Dyke was awarded the licence for Channel 5, and he became the first chairman of the new channel. He was appointed chairman of Channel 5 on 21 February 1997. Also in 1997 he was asked to review the Patients&#x27; Charter of the National Health Service.

===At the BBC===
In 2000, Dyke took over from John Birt as director-general of the BBC. He was appointed despite Conservative protests that he had donated £50,000 to the Labour Party and was a &#x27;crony&#x27;. At the beginning of his tenure, he famously promised to &quot;cut the crap&quot; at the corporation. The &quot;crap&quot; he referred to was the complex internal market Birt had introduced at the BBC which, it was argued, turned employees away from making programmes and into managers. Dyke reversed this trend – he reduced administration costs from 24% of total income to 15%. Unusually for a recent director-general, he had a good rapport with his employees and was popular with the majority of BBC staff, his management style being seen as more open and risk-taking than Birt&#x27;s.

Jonathan Gifford, who worked for BBC Magazines in BBC Worldwide during the management of Birt and Dyke, observed &quot;Dyke came across well. He was direct, sensible and approachable. His vision for the BBC was inspirational.&quot; Martin Montague, a producer on digital radio station BBC7 said &quot;I know that people in local radio think he walks on water because of all that he&#x27;s put into that.&quot;

Apart from restoring staff morale, Dyke laid claim to two major achievements during his office. In 2002, he introduced the Freeview terrestrial digital transmission platform with six additional BBC channels, and persuaded Sky TV to join the consortium. Previously this was an ITV subscription service that had closed with major losses, but by mid-2007 it could be seen by more than half the population. After leaving the BBC, he said that he always realised that the introduction of Freeview helped to prevent a subscription funding model for the BBC gain traction, because it is impossible for broadcasters to switch off the signal to individual Freeview boxes.

Dyke controversially described the corporation in early 2001 as &quot;hideously white&quot;, based on statistics that showed the organisation&#x27;s management structure was 98% white. Dyke said that &quot;The figures we have at the moment suggest that quite a lot of people from different ethnic backgrounds that we do attract to the BBC leave. Maybe they don&#x27;t feel at home, maybe they don&#x27;t feel welcome.&quot; Dyke set a target that by 2003, 10% of the BBC&#x27;s UK workforce and 4% of management would be from ethnic minority backgrounds. In September 2004, Dyke received an award for his remarks from Glasgow-based organisation Empower Scotland, which fights against workplace racism.

Dyke attracted criticism when he &quot;forgot&quot; to sell an equity stake in Granada Television, which presented a conflict of interest in his new position. He also caused controversy when he lost the rights to Premier League football to ITV, then accused the league of fixing the auction. Others were worried that the openness and high risk strategies of his management style could backfire on the corporation. An ITV executive was quoted as saying, &quot;By being too radical and playing fast and loose with the public service remit, the BBC is inviting external regulation – and it deserves it.&quot;

In 2009, Dyke said the BBC was part of a &quot;Westminster conspiracy&quot; preventing the &quot;radical changes&quot; needed to UK democracy and that the separation between the &quot;political class&quot;, including the BBC, and the public had never been greater. He said he had tried to raise the problem during his time in charge of the BBC but discussion had been blocked by a combination of the &quot;politicos on the board of governors&quot; of the BBC, the Labour cabinet and the political journalists at the BBC. He believed that these groups resist change as it is not in their interests.

===Hutton Report and resignation from BBC===
Dyke resigned from the BBC on 29 January 2004 along with Gavyn Davies and Andrew Gilligan, after the publication of the Hutton Report into the circumstances surrounding the death of David Kelly. Hutton described Dyke&#x27;s approach to checking news stories as &quot;defective&quot;; when Alastair Campbell complained about the story, Dyke had immediately defended it without investigating whether there was any merit to the complaint.

In an email sent to all BBC staff just prior to his resignation Dyke wrote:

It was subsequently established that Dyke had offered his resignation to the BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors while hoping that they would reject it. However, he was only able to secure the support of about one-third of the governors.

Some BBC staff felt that too much blame had been placed on their organisation in the wake of the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said &quot;Being independent doesn&#x27;t just mean not having the government telling you what to do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I&#x27;m not at all sure the government understands that.&quot; Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Derry, in protest at Dyke&#x27;s resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to express their &quot;dismay&quot; over Dyke&#x27;s departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the &quot;Telegraph&quot;″s advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.

The statement in the advertisement read:

Speaking on GMTV on 30 January, Dyke himself questioned the conclusions of the report, saying &quot;We were shocked it was so black and white [...] We knew mistakes had been made but we didn&#x27;t believe they were only by us.&quot; He also said Lord Hutton was &quot;quite clearly wrong&quot; on certain aspects of law relating to the case.

On 11 January 2007, the BBC published minutes of its post-Hutton board meetings. It was revealed that Dyke had said he had been &quot;mistreated and want[ed] to be reinstated&quot;.

===After the Hutton Inquiry===
On 28 November 2003, Dyke was formally appointed by the University of York as its new chancellor, replacing Dame Janet Baker, who had served in the post since November 1991. There was some controversy regarding his appointment in the midst of the Iraq Dossier scandal. He officially took the post in August 2004. In this role, he is the honorary and ceremonial head of the university, as well as heading the University Development Board. He has also made a personal grant to the new Department of Theatre, Film and Television, to found the Greg Dyke Chair in Film and Television. On 6 February 2004, Dyke announced that he had signed a six-figure book contract with HarperCollins. The book, &quot;Inside Story&quot;, subsequently published in September 2004, goes into detail about Dyke&#x27;s opinion on the relationship between the BBC and the British government, and of the Dr. David Kelly affair and Hutton Inquiry. In July 2004, Dyke was awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Sunderland, Middlesex University and in 2006 from The University of Bedfordshire. He was appointed chair of the British Film Institute on 15 February 2008, succeeding Anthony Minghella. On 10 March 2010, it was reported that he had been approached by Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev to edit &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; newspapers. 

In the wake of the &quot;News of the World&quot; hacking affair, Dyke frequently appeared in the media to comment on events. In April 2011, he said &quot;I don&#x27;t think the &quot;News of the World&quot; is a great contribution to British journalism. [...] They had obviously being playing fast and loose for a long time and are now getting their just deserts.&quot;

===Football administration===
Dyke has been a director of both Manchester United and Brentford football clubs, and was chairman of the FA from 2013 to 2016. He has said that he supported both clubs since he was a child, although his older brothers supported Tottenham. He became a fan of Brentford when his brother played for the club as a junior. Manager Bill Dodgin Sr. tried to sign his brother, but their father would not agree to him committing to what he saw as a badly paid and insecure career.

From 1997 to 1999, Dyke served as a non-executive director of Manchester United, and was the sole board member to oppose a takeover bid from BSkyB, which was subsequently rejected by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. When he became director-general of the BBC he admitted a &quot;potential conflict of interest&quot; between his new post and his non-executive directorship at Manchester United plc. He resigned his position to avoid controversy. In a speech at the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; Business of the Year Awards, he said &quot;it was seen as a conflict of interest to both buy and sell football rights. My kids have never forgiven me for joining the BBC because of that.&quot;

Dyke was the non-executive chairman of Brentford from 20 January 2006 until July 2013. He was appointed as part of the club takeover by Bees United, the Brentford Supporters Trust.

At Brentford, Dyke&#x27;s focus was on budget constraints for the small club and the necessity to generate money from televised matches and other means. Under Dyke the club&#x27;s performance was initially unsteady, with a few highlights but the club experiencing its worst run since the 1970s. On 28 January 2006, they beat Premier League strugglers Sunderland 2–1 in the fourth round of the FA Cup, but lost 3–1 to another Premier League club Charlton Athletic (of which former BBC chairman Michael Grade was non-executive director) in the fifth round.

The club finished third in the league that year and lost to Swansea City in the play-off semi-final. These initial slight successes preceded a spell of misfortune which saw Brentford lose 16 matches in a row and be relegated to Football League Two in 2007. Turnover of managers was fast, with Allen, Leroy Rosenior, Scott Fitzgerald, Alan Reeves, Barry Quin and Terry Butcher in the space of two years, before Butcher&#x27;s assistant Andy Scott got the team back on track, winning the League Two title on 25 April 2009. Scott could not continue the success and after a series of poor results he was sacked in February 2011. Dyke remained upbeat:

Dyke announced plans in 2010 for the club to move to a new ground, selling off the Griffin Park ground for residential housing to raise money. Dyke said: &quot;Our aim is to move into a new stadium in Lionel Road and to move there as a club free of debt.&quot;

Dyke replaced David Bernstein as chairman of The Football Association in July 2013 after relinquishing his role as Brentford chairman and receiving approval from the FA council. In September, Dyke warned of an &quot;alarming&quot; lack of homegrown talent in English football, with fewer and fewer homegrown players in the top flight, and set England the target of at least reaching the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2020 and then winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

After Sepp Blatter&#x27;s sudden departure from FIFA on 2 June 2015, when Blatter said he was resigning for honorable reasons and to allow FIFA to move on, Dyke said: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe a word of this. If he believes that, why not step down last week when we asked him to? He was cock-a-hoop when he won the election and terribly arrogant. Clearly there is a smoking gun. This is nothing to do with Mr Blatter being honorable; he hasn&#x27;t been honorable for years&quot;.

Dyke left the FA in 2016, deciding not to stand for re-election, as he struggled to reform the organisation. He was succeeded as chairman by Greg Clarke.

===Comments on &quot;News of the World&quot; phone hacking scandal===

Dyke appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme on 8 July 2011 alongside comedian Steve Coogan, where he confronted former &quot;News of the World&quot; deputy features editor Paul McMullen over his attitude to the events of the phone hacking scandal. Dyke told McMullen &quot;You&#x27;re [the tabloids] nothing to do with a free press, or a decent democracy&quot;. Distancing himself from McMullen he said &quot;I&#x27;ve spent most of my life being a journalist, and I&#x27;m nothing to do with him, and neither are most other journalists.&quot; He continued &quot;You could see there are occasionally, very occasionally, public interest cases but most of the time [it wouldn&#x27;t make it less morally reprehensible]. These guys [tabloid journalists] just tapped anyone they could think of&quot;. He was also of the opinion that stronger independent regulation of the press was needed, saying that broadcast media had always been more strictly regulated.

On 11 July 2011, Dyke wrote in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that &quot;from the moment it was revealed that the &quot;News of the World&quot; had hacked into Milly Dowler&#x27;s phone, Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s bid to buy the 60.9% of British Sky Broadcasting that News Corp does not already own was all but over&quot;. He said, &quot;for those of us who have been warning about the tactics used by the Murdoch operation for many years – Mr Murdoch once described me as &#x27;an enemy&#x27; – the events of the past week have been sweet.&quot;

==Political views==
In his early years, Dyke was an active supporter of the Labour Party. In 1977, he attempted to win a seat on the Greater London Council (GLC) for Labour at Putney. Until 1999, he was considered &quot;very much part of Tony Blair&#x27;s New England&quot;, attending parties to celebrate Labour&#x27;s 1997 election victory. He donated £55,000 to the party, which prompted controversy over his subsequent appointment as BBC director-general during the Blair government. He was also asked to write a report on the future of the NHS.

On 2 May 2005, prior to the general election, Dyke went public at a Liberal Democrats press conference and said that &quot;democracy was under threat if Labour was elected for a third term&quot;.

On 20 April 2009, it was announced that Dyke was to lead a review of the UK&#x27;s creative sector for the Conservative Party.

==Personal life==
Dyke has been married twice. He met his first wife Christine Taylor at the University of York; they were married for most of the 1970s. He lives in Hampshire, near Stockbridge, with his second wife, Susan Howes, a former sociology teacher and probation officer. Susan is now a trustee of Safe Ground, a charity which works with young offenders. They have four children. The Dykes also own a house on the west coast of County Cork, Ireland.

<text>The evaluates one&#x27;s knowledge of kanji. The test is more commonly known as the , or the shorter . The test is administered by the .

== Overview ==
There are 12 levels (levels 10 through 3, pre-2, 2, pre-1 and 1) with level 10 being the easiest and level 1 the most difficult. The test examines not only one&#x27;s ability to read and write kanji, but also one&#x27;s ability to understand their meanings, to use them correctly in sentences, and to identify their correct stroke order.

Native speakers pass levels 10 through 7 at better than an 80% rate, whereas level 1 is so difficult that fewer than two thousand people take it each time it is offered, and fewer than 20% of those pass.

For levels 10 through 8, the test is 40 minutes long; for levels 7 through 1, it is 60 minutes long. A minimal score of 70% is required to pass levels 7 through pre-2, and a score of 80% is required for levels 10 through 8, 2, pre-1, and 1.

Levels 10 through 4 are primarily taken by kindergarten to elementary school age (up to 12 years old) children. Levels 3 and above are typically taken by high-school students and adults.

Level 2 is as high as many Japanese, even those with higher education degrees, tend to go. Passing level 2 can be used as leverage when applying for jobs, etc. Passing levels pre-1 and 1 is especially rare even among native speakers.

<text>The Battle of Krefeld (sometimes referred to by its French name of Créfeld) was fought at Krefeld near the Rhine on 23 June 1758 between a Prussian-Hanoverian army and a French army during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

==Background==

The Hanoverian Army led by Ferdinand, the Duke of Brunswick and brother-in-law of Prussian King Frederick the Great, had driven the French led by the Comte de Clermont back across the Rhine. Ferdinand&#x27;s own army had crossed to the left bank of the Rhine and was now in a position to threaten the frontier of France itself. The Battle of Rheinberg fought on 12 June proved indecisive. Clermont, who had recently replaced the Duc de Richelieu in command of the French army, was attempting to stem Ferdinand&#x27;s advance. He chose a defensive line on the south side of a walled canal running roughly east and west. Thus the walled canal constituted a sort of natural fortification that Clermont thought would be easy to defend.

==Battle==
The allied Prussian and Hanoverian troops led by the Duke of Brunswick seized the initiative attacking the entrenched defensive French forces. After feigning an attack against Clermont&#x27;s own right flank, Ferdinand executed a wide flanking march, crossing the canal out of sight of the French and emerging from a wooded area on Clermont&#x27;s left flank. Clermont, who had just sat down for a midday meal, was late in sending reinforcements and, as a result, his left flank was crushed.

The Comte de Gisors, the popular, charismatic, only child of the French minister of war, the Duc de Belle-Isle, was mortally wounded while charging at the head of the French Carabiniers. The Comte de St. Germain, who commanded the French left wing, was nevertheless able to put together a sufficient defense to prevent a complete rout, and the French army retired from the field in relatively good order.

==Aftermath==
The Erbprinz, son of the ruling Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who later died of wounds received at the battle of Jena during the Napoleonic Wars, particularly distinguished himself commanding the allied flanking troops. Clermont asked to be relieved of his command after this defeat, and his wish was granted. He was succeeded in command by Marshal de Contades.

==Notes==
There is no consensus at all on species limits in &quot;Betula&quot;, with different authors differing wildly in what species they accept, from under 30 species, to over 60. The above (incomplete) list was compiled from the references cited below. Birches will hybridise very freely, particularly in cultivation but also in the wild where conditions and species present permit. While differing chromosome number (diploid, tetraploid, etc.) may reduce interbreeding, it is not an absolute bar to it. Many botanists regard differing chromosome number as a specific discriminant, though not all do so (e.g. some include &quot;B. cordifolia&quot; and &quot;B. neoalaskana&quot; as varieties within &quot;B. papyrifera&quot;).

<text>Stephen Grellet (28 October 1772 – 16 November 1855) was a prominent French-American Quaker missionary.

==Life==

Grellet was born Étienne de Grellet du Mabillier in Limoges, France, the son of Antoine Gabriel Grellet, a counsellor of King Louis XVI who was also director of the first chinaware factory in Limoges. His family had some interest in iron making. Raised as a Roman Catholic, he was educated at the Military College of Lyons, now the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Lyon, and at the age of 17 he entered the personal guard of the king. During the French Revolution he was sentenced to be executed, but escaped and eventually fled Europe to Demerara in South America with his brother Joseph in 1793, then to New York in 1795. 

While in New York he met Deborah Darby, an English Quaker minister who had been in the U.S. since August 1793. Darby made an impression on Grellet and under her and William Savery&#x27;s influence he decided to join the Quakers (Society of Friends). Darby and Grellet became friends; when Darby returned to Britain with her colleague Rebecca Young, she was accompanied by four American Quakers (including William Savery), and Grellet was there to wave them off. 

Grellet became involved in extensive missionary work in prisons and hospitals across North America and most of the countries of Europe, and was granted meetings with many rulers and dignitaries, including Pope Pius VII, Tsar Alexander I, and the Kings of Spain and Prussia. He often travelled with William Allen, and visited many schools, hospitals and prisons as well as speaking out against slavery. He also visited Haiti in 1816 and Russia in 1819. 

In 1804 Grellet married Rebecca Collins, the daughter of the publisher Isaac Collins. The family home, the Isaac Collins House, in Burlington, New Jersey, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Grellet died in Burlington on 16 November 1855 and his body was buried there, behind the Quaker Meeting House at 340 High Street.

==Family==
Grellet was married to Rebecca and they had one daughter, Rachel.

<text>Peter Leko (; born September 8, 1979) is a Hungarian chess grandmaster and commentator. He became the world&#x27;s youngest grandmaster in 1994. He narrowly missed winning the Classical World Chess Championship 2004: the match was drawn 7–7 and so Vladimir Kramnik retained the title. He also came fifth in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 and fourth in the World Chess Championship 2007.

Leko has achieved victories in many major chess tournaments, including the annual tournaments at Dortmund, Linares, Wijk aan Zee and the Tal Memorial in Moscow. He won two team silver medals and an individual gold medal representing Hungary at eight Chess Olympiads as well as team bronze and silver and an individual silver medal at three European Team Championships.

Leko has been ranked as high as fourth in the FIDE world rankings, which he first achieved in April 2003.
==Early years==
Peter Leko was born into an ethnic Hungarian family in the city of Subotica, Yugoslavia, but moved to Szeged when he was one year old. He was taught chess by his father shortly before he turned seven and took part in tournaments from the age of nine. His first coach Tibor Károlyi began work with him in 1989, ending three months before Leko became a grandmaster. They later reunited in 1998 until the end of 2000. Leko also worked with International Master Gaspar Mathe when he was ten years old.

As a junior player, Leko competed in several age categories in the World Youth Chess Championship, winning bronze in the under-10 section in 1989, bronze in the under-12 in 1990, fourth place in the under-14 in 1992, silver in the under-14 in 1993 and gold in the under-16 in 1994.

Leko earned the International Master title in 1992. In 1994 he became a Grandmaster at the age of 14 years, 4 months and 22 days, at the time the youngest to have done so, breaking the record previously held by Judit Polgár. His norms came at a First Saturday tournament in Budapest and Leon (sharing third place with Anatoly Karpov and Veselin Topalov) in 1993, and shared third place at Hoogovens in 1994.

==Rising to the top==
Leko showed his class in winning at Copenhagen in 1995 with 8 points out of 11 games. Soon after, Leko competed at Dortmund where he shared third place (5 points out of 9 games) with Vassily Ivanchuk, backing up his new world ranking, placing him 55th with 2605 Elo. At Belgrade, a last round loss to Ivanchuk pushed him down to eighth place. He slipped to last place in Dortmund in 1996 but recovered with fourth place in Vienna (5/9). In 1997, Leko won in Cienfuegos (5/9) and Yopal (6½/9) and took fourth place at the traditional Tilburg chess tournament (7/11) establishing him as a rising star, climbing to 16th in the world rankings in the January 1998 list.

Leko continued his rise up the rankings with second place (7/11) behind Viswanathan Anand at Tilburg in 1998, fourth place (5/9) in Dortmund and fourth place (6½/14) at Linares in early 1999. Leko&#x27;s run of form culminated in achieving his first major tournament win (5/7) at Dortmund, half a point ahead of Vladimir Kramnik. It was at this tournament that he met his future wife, Sofia.

He made his first entry into World Championship tournaments at the FIDE World Chess Championship 1999 held in Las Vegas, defeating Christian Bauer 1½-½ but losing to eventual quarter-finalist Sergei Movsesian after rapid tiebreaks 2½-1½. In January 2000, Leko faced the winner, FIDE World Champion Alexander Khalifman in a six-game match held in Budapest, which he won 4½-1½.

Leko followed up his victory by sharing second place (8/13) with Kramnik and Anand at Corus behind a dominant Garry Kasparov, sharing last place (4½/10) at Linares and sharing second place (5/8) with Kramnik at Dortmund. At the FIDE World Chess Championship 2000 held in New Delhi (rounds 1-6) and Tehran (final), Leko was knocked out in the third round by Khalifman (4½-3½) after &quot;sudden death&quot; tiebreaks.

In 2001, Leko posted solid results in Corus (6½/13), Linares (4½/10), third place in Dortmund (5½/10) and winning an eight-game Chess 960 (Fischer Random Chess) match against Michael Adams at Mainz. The year was rounded off with an early exit in the second round of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2002, held in Moscow, at the hands of Ashot Anastasian (2½-1½) after rapid tiebreaks.

Leko started 2002 solidly with a sixth-place finish (7/13) at Corus, sharing third place (4½/9) in the NAO Masters held in Cannes and second place (7/9) at Essen behind Vadim Zvjaginsev.

==Classical World Championship Challenger==
Under the terms of the Prague Agreement signed in May 2002, &quot;The Dortmund winner will play the Classical World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik and the present FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov will play Garry Kasparov, the current World&#x27;s number one rated player&quot;.

The Dortmund Chess Meeting was held in June 2002 with the format a two-stage event, with two-four player groups played as double round robins, with the two top players from each group progressing to a knockout stage determining the winner.

Leko qualified comfortably from the B Group in second place to Evgeny Bareev and faced Alexei Shirov in a four-game match. This ended early with the score 2½-½ in Leko&#x27;s favour. In the final of the Tournament Leko met Veselin Topalov, who had been in good form in the run up to the tournament but had a draining match which had gone to tiebreaks against Bareev in the semi-finals. The match was won by Leko 2½-1½, ensuring he became the official challenger to Vladimir Kramnik for the Classical World Chess Championship 2004.

His Candidates triumph was followed up by leading the Hungarian team on board one to team silver in the 35th Chess Olympiad with an unbeaten run, along with sharing first (7/12) at Linares in early 2003 with Kramnik, half a point ahead of Anand and Kasparov, notably ending a ten super-tournament winning streak by Kasparov. This was shortly followed up by second place at the 12th Amber Melody tournament (Blind 6/11, Rapid 7½/11) a point behind Anand, and a solid result (5/9) in Budapest. At Dortmund, Leko disappointed with 4/10, considered to be due to the difficulties regarding the organising of the match with Kramnik.

2004 started brightly for Leko with shared second place (8/13) with Adams in Corus, half a point behind Anand and sharing second place (6½/12) with Kasparov in Linares, half a point behind Kramnik. He competed as part of an Armenia vs Rest of the World match, scoring 4/6 and finished in fourth place in Dortmund (held in the same format as the Candidates Tournament in 2002 but with play-offs for final positions).

== Classical World Championship Match ==

After several delays due to the collapse of the Einstein Group, who were originally to have organised the match, Leko contested the Classical World Chess Championship 2004 held from September 25 to October 18, 2004, in Brissago, Switzerland. Leko was helped by Vladimir Akopian, Arshak Petrosian and Vladislav Tkachiev.

In a match containing six games agreed as drawn before 25 moves, Leko lost the first game in dramatic fashion despite placing Kramnik&#x27;s Petroff Defence under pressure after making a blunder in an unbalanced endgame where his Queen was slowly outmanoeuvred by Kramnik&#x27;s pair of Rooks. Then followed two short draws and a hard-fought draw in Game 4 where Leko over-pressed with Black in a Ruy Lopez opening but Kramnik failed to take advantage of an extra pawn in the rook endgame.

Leko equalised the match score in Game 5 after switching his White opening from 1.e4 to 1.d4 playing a Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined line that Kramnik was familiar with. Kramnik allowed himself to enter a Rook and Bishop endgame a pawn down but with the likely result a draw. Leko used his pawns to press through the centre. Kramnik believed he could construct a fortress and save a draw but Leko managed to find a way to convert the win. In game six, a short draw was agreed after Kramnik declined a pawn sacrifice. In game seven, Leko was surprised by an unusual move order in the opening and simplified the position leading to a draw soon after, closing out the first half of the match with the score 3½–3½.

In Game 8, Leko scored an important win, taking the match lead for the first time. For the first time Kramnik allowed Leko to play the aggressive Marshall Attack variation of the Ruy Lopez. Kramnik played a queen sacrifice and continuation which his team had believed via computer analysis to be fine for him. However, Leko exploited a hole in the preparation and by sacrificing material created a decisive advantage.

Between two short draws in Game 9 and 11, notable for Kramnik&#x27;s change of opening with Black to Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence, Game 10 saw Leko eventually finding a successful defence to Kramnik&#x27;s opening advantage. That was enough to persuade Leko to change his opening with Black to the Caro-Kann for Game 12. Kramnik pressed but Leko found enough counterplay to repel him and secure a draw.

In the penultimate Game 13, in search of a win, Kramnik switched opening again with Black to the dynamic Benoni Defence and launched a kingside attack in the middlegame while Leko&#x27;s pieces were on the queenside. Leko managed to liquidate the position to a tense Rook and pawn endgame where Leko&#x27;s precise defence nullified Kramnik&#x27;s advantage, leading to a draw.

In a dramatic final game, with Leko needing only a draw to secure the Championship, Kramnik chose the Advance variation against Leko&#x27;s Caro-Kann and placed immediate pressure on Leko using a line played during the Tal–Botvinnik World Championship Match of 1961. Leko&#x27;s plan to exchange off White&#x27;s pieces and form a fortress did not work and Kramnik was able to break through the Black position. Leko resigned when checkmate was threatened. Under the rules of the match, with the score tied 7–7, Kramnik retained his title as &quot;Classical&quot; World Champion and would move on to an eventual reunification match against Veselin Topalov in 2006. By virtue of a draw, Leko became vice-champion.

== Career after Brissago ==
Despite the drawn match, Leko maintained a high level in 2005, winning the Corus tournament with 8½/13. and finishing fourth at Linares (6/12). After taking a break, Leko attended the first Miskolc Rapid match against World No.7 Michael Adams in which Leko lost the first three games, won the next three and drew out the remaining two, ending the match 4-4. A 4/9 at Dortmund was followed by competing for the FIDE World Chess Championship title in San Luis, Argentina having qualified as most recent &quot;Classical&quot; challenger, finishing fifth with 6½/14. For more information, see FIDE World Chess Championship 2005.

In 2006, Leko scored solid results at Corus (tied 7th, 6½/14), Morelia-Linares (fifth, 7½/14), a 4½-3½ win in the Miskolc Rapid match against Anatoly Karpov, Dortmund (tied third, 4/7) and in sharing first place with 5½/9 at the inaugural Tal Memorial, he completed a career &quot;Grand Slam&quot; of major tournament victories at Dortmund, Linares, Corus and Tal Memorial. The next year, Leko struggled at Morelia-Linares tying for last place and lost the Miskolc Rapid match 4½-3½ against Vladimir Kramnik soon after.

Leko regained his form for the Candidates Matches held between 26 May and 13 June, held to select 4 players for the World Chess Championship 2007. The format was held as a 16-player two-round knockout tournament with each match best of six games. He comfortably won his matches against Mikhail Gurevich (+3−0=1) and Evgeny Bareev (+2−0=3), to qualify for the eight-player championship tournament. A few months later, he won the ACP World Rapid Chess Cup. Shortly after the World Chess Championship 2007 was held in Mexico City from 12–30 September as an 8-player double round robin. Leko finished in fourth place with 7/14 and rounded off the year tying for third place (4½/9) at the Tal Memorial.

In 2008, Leko tied for fifth in a strong field at Corus with 7/13 but tied for last place in Morelia-Linares with 5½/14 and lost a Miskolc Rapid match 3½-4½ against 17-year-old Magnus Carlsen, but rebounded 4 months later with his third victory at Dortmund (after 1999 and 2002) with 4½/7, sixth place (4½/9) in a tough field at the Tal Memorial and securing individual gold on board 1 at the 38th Chess Olympiad held in Dresden.

Leko took part in the FIDE Grand Prix 2008-2010 which selected two players for the 2011 Candidates Tournament, electing to play in the four later tournaments in the 6-tournament cycle. In Elista, Russia, he shared fifth place with 6½/13, in Nalchik shared second with 7½/13, shared fourth at Jermuk with 7½/13 and shared seventh place at Astrakhan with 6½/13. With his weakest result at Astrakhan not counting towards his points tally, he finished in seventh place overall with 320 points, the highest final placing of a player who did not win an event. As he did not take part in the World Cup held in 2011, Leko did not progress to the Candidates Tournament.

Aside from the FIDE Grand Prix cycle, 2009 saw Leko lose a Miskolc Rapid match 3-5 against Viswanathan Anand, tie for second place with Magnus Carlsen and Dmitry Jakovenko with 5½/10 in a very strong Dortmund and finished in fourth place in Nanjing, China. He struggled at the Tal Memorial of 2009 scoring 3/9, broke even at Corus 2010 with 6½/13, lost what would be the final Miskolc Rapid match 3½-4½ against Boris Gelfand and came bottom of the Dortmund field with 4/10. After representing Hungary in the 39th Chess Olympiad in September he took several months away from chess.

He made his return to chess at the World Team Chess Championship held in Ningbo, China in July 2011 with an undefeated 5½/9 on board 1. This was followed up by a shock first round exit from the Chess World Cup 2011 against Sam Shankland and a third-place finish at the Saratov Governor&#x27;s Cup. The year was rounded off with 5½/9 at the European Team Championships held in Halkidiki, Greece.
In April 2012, Leko scored 4/6 for Moscow&#x27;s SHSM-64 team at the Russian Team Championships then came second with 5/7 at Sigeman &amp; Co Tournament, half a point behind Fabiano Caruana. At Dortmund, Leko shared third place with Kramnik, Naiditsch and Ruslan Ponomariov, scoring 5½/9 and narrowly missed a win against tournament winner Caruana, followed up by scoring 5½/10 at the 40th Chess Olympiad, held in Istanbul.

In September 2012 he entered the FIDE Grand Prix 2012-13 as a nominee of AGON, who owned the rights to the World Championship cycle. At the first event, held in London, he finished in fifth place with an undefeated 6/11 and at the Tashkent event tied for seventh with a solid 5½/11 a month later. In April 2013 at the Zug event, he shared seventh place with Sergey Karjakin and Anish Giri scoring 5/11. After skipping the event held in Thessaloniki during the next month, he tied for third place with eventual series winner Veselin Topalov at the fifth event held in Beijing, scoring 6/11. Having completed his four tournaments in the cycle, Leko did not take part in the sixth and final event and finished the Grand Prix cycle in 13th place with 230 points (the result in Zug not counting towards his points tally).

Outside of the Grand Prix cycle, Leko helped the SHSM team secure third place at the European Chess Club Cup held in Eilat, Israel in October 2012, with a score of 3/6. Leko also took part in the World Mind Games finishing seventh with 3½/7 in the Rapid section and 6½/15 in the Blitz. He placed a strong fifth place at the Tata Steel Chess (formerly Corus) event in January 2013 with 7½/13. In April, he scored 3/6 for Ugra in the Russian Team Championships and in July, shared third with 4½/9 at Dortmund with Naiditsch. Leko tied for third with 5/9 at the Sherbank Rapid held in Kyiv in June. In August 2013, Leko was knocked out of the FIDE World Cup 2013 in the second round ½-1½ by Julio Granda, followed by scoring 4½/7 for sixth-placed Ugra at the European Club Cup held in Rhodes in October.

Leko finished the year at the World Mind Games with tied first in the Rapid section (losing out on head-to-head tiebreak) but tired with a 16th placed 11/30 in the Blitz section. In April 2014, Leko played in the Russian Team Championships for Malachite scoring 5/7, in July tied for second with 4/7 at Dortmund with Georg Meier and contributed to a team silver medal at the 41st Chess Olympiad with 5/10.

In August 2015, he played a 6-game match with Chinese Grandmaster Li Chao in the city of Szeged in Hungary. He lost the match +0-2=4.

Since November 2017, he has been coaching the German prodigy Vincent Keymer.

===Team chess results===
Leko first represented Hungary aged 15 years and two months at the 31st Chess Olympiad, going on to make seven more appearances at the Chess Olympiad, winning two team silvers and an individual gold, as follows:

Leko also took part in numerous Team Chess Championships, both at World and European level (notably debuting at Debrecen in 1992 at the age of 13 years 2 months), with results as follows:

== Playing style==
Peter Leko is known for playing in a solid and steady manner, avoiding risks. In his words, &quot;I like to play in a “clean and clear” way, and I am definitely not the type of guy who takes unnecessary risks. I believe much more in the logic of our game rather than gambling on your opponent&#x27;s nerves.&quot;

Jacob Aagaard commented, &quot;Peter Leko has three essential qualities (that I know about). He has a great opening repertoire, he is a greatly gifted technical player and a very nice guy. If he had a good understanding of dynamics as well, he would have been one of the greatest players of our time (rather than just one game away from being World Champion!).&quot; Despite criticism that his style leads to drawish chess, his consistent style has seen him remain in the elite since he was a teenager and win multiple elite-level tournaments.

Leko has acted as a second in World Championship matches (for Anand vs Karpov in Lausanne 1997, for Kramnik vs Anand in Bonn 2008, for Anand vs Carlsen in Chennai 2013) due to his theoretical understanding in the openings phase of the game.

=== Sample game ===
On the way to winning the prestigious Corus chess tournament in 2005, Leko defeated Viswanathan Anand with the black pieces. The moves were:

1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7. Bg5 a6 8. Na3 b5 9. Bxf6 gxf6 10. Nd5 f5 11. c3 Bg7 12. exf5 Bxf5 13. Nc2 0-0 14. Nce3 Be6 15. Bd3 f5 16. 0-0 Ra7 17. a4 Ne7 18. Nxe7+ Rxe7 19. axb5 axb5 20. Bxb5 d5 21. Ra6 f4 22. Nc2 Bc8 23. Ra8 Qd6 24. Nb4 Bb7 25. Ra7 d4 26. Ba6? (see diagram) 
:Better was 26.Bc6 Bxc6 27.Rxe7 Qxe7 28.Nxc6 with approximate equality.

26... Bxg2! 27. Bc4+ Kh8 28. Ra6 Qc5 29. Kxg2 f3+ 30. Kh1 Qxc4 31. Rc6 Qb5 32. Rd6 e4 33. Rxd4 Bxd4 34. Qxd4+ Qe5 35. Qxe5+ Rxe5 36. Nc2 Rb8 37. Ne3 Rc5 38. h3 Rxb2 39. c4 Rg5 40.

<text>Robert K. Wright Jr. (born 1946) is an American military historian and author.

== Biography ==
Wright was raised in Connecticut. He attended the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, and earned a degree in history in 1968. He served in the U.S. Army as a Teletype operator in Berlin, after which he served with the 18th Military History Detachment where in 1969–1970 he devoted time recording the operations of the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam.

Sergeant Wright received his honorable discharge in 1970. Under the GI Bill, he attended graduate school at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, earning a Master of Arts in 1968 and a Ph.D. in history in 1980. He spent the greater portion of his career at the United States Army Center of Military History in Washington, D.C. He was then commissioned in the Virginia Army National Guard in 1982 with the rank of captain where he commanded the 116th Military History Detachment in Manassas, Virginia, ultimately being promoted to a major. Wright served at Fort Bragg, North Carolina from 1989 to 1991, as the XVIII Airborne Corps command historian, where he deployed with the corps to Panama (Operation Just Cause) and the first Persian Gulf war (Operation Desert Shield-Desert Storm). He also deployed to Somalia (Operation Restore Hope) as an Army Reservist as part of the first-ever joint history team composed of historians from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. In 2002 Wright retired from government service as the chief of the Center of Military History&#x27;s library and archives. Wright&#x27;s 1983 book, &quot;The Continental Army&quot;, is widely considered the standard reference work covering the army of the American Revolutionary War.

<doc id="446803" wikidata="Q3147880" url="?curid=446803" title="River Idle">
<text>The River Idle is a river in Nottinghamshire, England whose source is the confluence of the River Maun and River Meden near Markham Moor. The Idle flows north from its source through Retford and Bawtry before entering the River Trent at West Stockwith. Its main tributaries are the River Poulter and the River Ryton. The river is navigable to Bawtry, and there is a statutory right of navigation to Retford. Most of the land surrounding the river is a broad flood plain and the river is important for conservation, with Sites of Special Scientific Interest being designated along its course.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is not known. River Idle is commonly taken to mean &#x27;slow river&#x27; but this is unlikely as river names tend to be even older than settlement names, and the modern name is also at odds with the fact that it is known as a very fast flowing river.

The Survey of English Placenames suggests that Idle (Idel) can mean an empty or uncultivated place. This would fit with the finding that it runs through Bassetlaw which was previously known as Bernetseatte (burnt lands). Bede (HE 2, 12) names the river &#x27;Idla&#x27; in 617 with reference to the Battle. This preserves what might have been an earlier ending -ea (meaning river.) In 1200 (British Museum Index of Charters) the river appears as Yddil.

More fancifully, the Jacobean antiquary Dr. Robert Thoroton suggested, before the advent of modern etymology, that the name derived instead from a supposed Roman place-name - Adelocum - claiming that &quot;the river Idle had its name from corn, with which the neighbouring fields ever abounded, and Adelocum was intended by the Romans for the place upon Ydel, after the broad pronunciation of Ai for I, which is still frequent in this country...Ydle signifying a granary amongst the Britons&quot;.. Unfortunately for his hypothesis, the Roman settlement at Littleborough is now known to have been named Segelocum rather than Adelocum, and so cannot have been the origin of the River Idle&#x27;s name.

==Hydrology==

The River Idle is a significant tributary of the River Trent. The Rivers Maun, Meden and Poulter meet near Eaton, south of Retford to form the River Idle and are joined just above Bawtry by the River Ryton. The River Idle turns eastwards at Bawtry to its confluence with the River Trent at the village of West Stockwith.

The catchment area for the River Idle covers some , which has an average annual rainfall of (based on figures from 1961 to 1990). About a third of this finds its way into the rivers.

There are sources of groundwater (aquifers) across the Idle catchment area, which is dominated by Lower Magnesian Limestone, Sherwood Sandstone and Mercia Mudstone. To the west of the catchment area the underlying geology is Lower Magnesian Limestone which contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, and is rich in Magnesium. To the east there is the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are these are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. Where these aquifers reach the surface, they often supply water to the river system, but can also take water from it.

Public water supply in the Idle catchment area is primarily sourced from the principal aquifer of the Sherwood Sandstone with multiple borehole sites. However, the catchment also receives imported water from Derbyshire. Three water companies cover the catchment area: Severn Trent Water, Anglian Water and Yorkshire Water.
This is affected by the extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.

==History==

It is possible that Bawtry acted as a sea port from Roman times, but little is known of this early period. However, it was associated with the sea by the 12th century, when the parish church was dedicated to St Nicholas, the patron saint of seafarers, and the Hundred Rolls of 1276 listed it as a port. There are records of lead being shipped during the early 1300s, and wool was shipped to Dordrecht from Nottinghamshire via Hull in 1337. The prosperous trading community there suffered a downturn in the early 16th century, but subsequently recovered, with lead being shipped directly to London in 1596. In the same year, a ford constructed across the Bycarrsdyke was described as &quot;a great hindrance to navigation.&quot;

===The Battle of the River Idle===

Bede records the Battle of the River Idle in 616 or 617 in the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica&quot; as part of the story of how Edwin came to be king of Northumbria. Bede tells how Rædwald provided refuge for the exiled Edwin, before assembling an army to confront Edwin&#x27;s dynastic enemy Æthelfrith. The two armies met on the western boundary of the kingdom of Lindsey, on the east bank of the River Idle. The battle was said to be so fierce that it was commemorated in the saying, &#x27;The river Idle was foul with the blood of Englishmen&#x27;. During the fighting, both Æthelfrith and Rædwald&#x27;s son Rægenhere were slain. Edwin then succeeded Æthelfrith as the king of Northumbria, and Æthelfrith&#x27;s sons were subsequently forced into exile.

A separate account of the battle, given by Henry of Huntingdon in the 12th century &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;, stated that Rædwald&#x27;s army was split into three formations, led by Rædwald, Rægenhere, and Edwin. With more experienced fighters, Æthelfrith attacked in loose formation. At the sight of Rægenhere, perhaps thinking he was Edwin, Æthelfrith&#x27;s men cut their way through to him and slew him. After the death of his son, Rædwald furiously breached Æthelfrith&#x27;s lines, killing him and resulting in a great slaughter of the Northumbrians.

===Vermuyden and the Participants===

Until the 17th century, the Idle flowed northwards across Hatfield Chase. To the west of Wroot, the River Torne formed two channels, both of which joined the Idle to the east of Wroot, and the Idle continued to join the River Don to the north west of Sandtoft. From Dirtness, the Don flowed to the north east, to Adlingfleet, where it joined the River Trent near to its confluence with the River Ouse. At some point, a navigable channel was cut from the Idle, running eastwards to the River Trent. Dates for this are uncertain, but it is known to have existed prior to the Domesday survey of 1086, and the villages of East Stockwith and West Stockwith developed at the junction with the Trent. Bykers Dyke was some long, and diverted the majority of the flow of the Idle to Stockwith.

In 1626, the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was appointed by King Charles I to drain Hatfield Chase. Vermuyden brought over a number of Walloon partners, known as &#x27;The Participants&#x27;, who took shares and performed the drainage work, which was completed two years later. The Idle&#x27;s northern course was blocked by a dam constructed at a place which subsequently became known as &#x27;Idle Stop&#x27;, its waters diverted along the Bycarrs Dyke. The ancient channel was straightened, made deeper, and embanked.

In order to isolate the river from Hatfield Chase, a barrier bank was constructed along the northern edge of this channel, for from the dam to West Stockwith. A navigable sluice was built about from the river mouth at Misterton Soss by Vermuyden&#x27;s nephew, John Liens, between 1629 and 1630, to prevent water from the Trent flooding the land to the south of Bycarrs Dike. The construction was of timber, with high banks running to the Trent on both sides of the channel. Lifting gates gave access to a lock chamber , which could be used when the Trent was not in flood. Liens was compelled to carry out the work by the Court of Sewers, to prevent the flooding of Misterton and Haxey Commons.
A drainage channel called the New Idle River was constructed in a straight line from Idle Stop to Dirtness, crossing the Torne by a tunnel at Tunnel Pits, about halfway along its course. From Dirtness, it was routed to the east to Hirst, where it was joined by the new course of the Torne, and the two channels ran parallel to an outfall at Althorpe on the Trent.

There was a great deal of dissatisfaction with the drainage scheme, which resulted in claims and counter-claims in the courts. A petition alleging that the Participants had caused damage was brought to the Privy Council by several local authorities from Nottinghamshire, and was judged in their favour. The Commission of Sewers decided that a new cut was needed, to carry water from Misterton, Gringley and Everton to the Trent, and so relieve the Idle, but only about was constructed before landowners objected and the work was not completed.

===The English Civil War===

During the English Civil War much of the drainage scheme was damaged. The Dutch engineers or &#x27;Participants&#x27; supported the King, while ordinary people on the Isle of Axholme supported the Parliamentarians. Alleging that the Royalists would invade Axholme from the south, villagers broke down Misterton sluice and the Snow Sewer flood gates in 1642 or 1643, causing widespread flooding and damage estimated at £20,000. The Sheriff of Lincoln repaired both structures, but a band of 400 villagers destroyed them again. Legal action and rioting continued for some years. Nathaniel Reading, acting for the Participants, raised an &#x27;army&#x27; in 1656, and fought a total of 31 pitched battles, including several against the men of Misterton and Gringley. It was not until 1719 that the issues were finally settled and peace returned to the area.

===Navigation and the 1720 act of Parliament===

The Idle was only navigable to Bawtry using shallow-drafted boats that were capable of carrying between 12 and 24 tons. Following the construction of the lock at Misterton Soss, which had guillotine gates, any sailing vessels using the river had to lower their masts, and although trade increased during the 17th century, the size of boats on the river tended to be smaller, with their cargoes being transhipped into larger vessels once they reached the Trent. The destruction of the drainage works and the lock during riots in 1643 meant that ships could again reach Bawtry, and lead was shipped directly to Amsterdam in 1645. A new sluice was built in 1645, on the instruction of the Court of Sewers, but by 1720 it was hindering navigation, and the Court of Sewers ruled that the gates should be kept open, unless there was a danger of flooding. Soon afterwards, the single guillotine gate was replaced by a pound lock, which had mitred gates at its upper end and a guillotine gate at its lower end. The new lock was completed by 1724, and was long by wide. By 1833, the guillotine gate had been replaced by a second pair of mitred gates.
In 1720, the merchants of East Retford obtained an act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 1. c. 30), to allow them to make the river navigable to Retford and to charge tolls. Although no work was carried out, the plans were still being considered in 1757, by which time much of the river&#x27;s trade had been lost - the Derbyshire lead trade using an improved River Derwent and the Sheffield trade using the River Don Navigation. Of the 4,415 tons of goods handled by Bawtry wharf in 1767, over 25 percent was lead, but trade had been declining for some years.

The opening of the Chesterfield Canal in 1777 and the Great Northern Railway in 1849 severely affected traffic, with Piercy, a local historian from Retford reporting in 1828 that the river was &quot;idle, as far as navigation goes, and in all probability will remain so.&quot; Misterton Soss was rebuilt in 1883 as a three-arched bridge, with gates and boards to control the river level. The upper gates of the lock faced upstream, but it appears that by 1910 the lower gates of the lock and those on the arches used as sluices all faced downstream, so that they closed as the tide rose. Thus vessels could only pass through when the Idle and Trent made a level.

===Building of Great North Railway===
The Great Northern Railway route from to passed through Bawtry railway station, which opened in 1849. When it was being constructed, a new cut for the river was made at Bawtry due to there being a large bend just above the wharf at Bawtry, but the new channel to the wharf soon silted up. The railway severely impacted the already dwindling commercial traffic on the river.

===Historic descriptions===
Daniel Defoe visited the Idle in the early 18th century and described it as &quot;full and quick, though not rapid and unsafe...with a deep channel, which carries hoys, lighters, barges or flat-bottomed vessels&quot;. He described the port of Bawtry as &quot;the centre of all the exportation of this part of the country, especially for heavy goods.&quot; Traffic included lead from Derbyshire, brought to Bawtry by pack horse, Swedish iron bound for Sheffield, cutlery from Sheffield, iron products from furnaces in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, together with coal and timber.

===Milling===
Near to Retford the river has historically provided power to at least three watermills, at Gamston, Ordsall and Bolham. The furthest upsteam was Gamston Mill. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, Gamston had two mills, valued at 40 shillings (£2), and may also have had two walk mills or fulling mills. Later, the single mill served a variety of purposes, as it was a spinning mill between 1784 and 1805, but is also known to have had a pair of stones in 1789, which would have been used to grind corn, and was probably producing candlewick fabric in 1797. By 1820 it has become a corn mill, while it was involved in the production of paper between 1836 and 1840. It then reverted to a corn mill, as three pairs of French stones, a pair of grey stones, and a flour machine were recorded when the building was being demolished in 1850. Subsequently, the site was known as Mill Farm. The mill was rebuilt around the 1800s, as papers of the Dukes of Newcastle record a payment towards the cost of building Gamston Mill under an agreement made by Henry Pelham-Clinton, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. He died in 1794, although the papers relate to the period from 1807 to 1811.

Ordsall Mill was situated on the right bank of the Idle, just above Goosemoor Lane bridge. The three-storey building probably dated from the 18th century, and had brick walls, with a tile roof . There was a corn mill on the site in 1701, and a paper mill in 1727. Water power was supplemented by a steam engine in 1851, and it was listed as a flour mill in a sales document dating from 1890. Milling ceased in the early 20th century, and the building was in use as a store for scrap iron by 1933. It was demolished in 1989.

A mill at Bolham was mentioned in the Domesday Book, and in 1258 it had to pay tithes to the vicar of Clarburgh. In 1707 the waterwheel was large and wooden, but was subsequently replaced by an undershot wheel which was in diameter and wide. In 1771 it was rebuilt to manufacture candlewick fabric, and was rebuilt again in 1800. In 1825 it was working as a corn mill with four pairs of stones. By 1835, it was a corn mill, a wood turning mill and was also producing glazed boards. It had become a corn mill, paper mill and saw mill by 1850, and a four-storey warehouse was built on the site around this time. It was extended in 1854 to become a paper mill, but was unused by 1866. Water power was supplemented by a steam engine by 1877, and it ceased to be used as a paper mill in 1883, when it was bought by Edwin Ashworth and became a tannery. By 1963 it had two breast-shot waterwheels, one of which had been used since the 1940s, while the other drove the entire plant. Water power was no longer in use by 1977, and the leats and wheels had been removed. The mill was demolished in the late 20th century, and the site was redeveloped as flats.

==The Idle today==
===Management===
The Land Drainage Act 1930 passed responsibility for the management of the River Idle to the newly formed Trent River Catchment Board. In 1938 they built the Trent-Idle sluice across the mouth of the Idle, next to the road bridge. It consisted of a single guillotine gate, wide and high which was regularly opened when tides were low to allow the Idle to discharge into the Trent by gravity. During periods when the Trent was in flood, the gate could not be opened, and the lower reaches of the Idle acted as a pond, with water backing up as far upstream as the junction with the River Ryton, and large areas of washland becoming inundated.

The catchment board was superseded by the Trent River Board, under the provisions of the River Boards Act 1948, which dredged the river and maintained the river level some above ordnance datum. In 1963, the sluice at Misterton Soss was abandoned. The south wall and floor of the lock were removed, and the river level was allowed to run down to the level of low water in the Trent, making navigation difficult.

The Trent River Authority (General Powers) Act 1971 (1971 c. lviii) intended to remove navigation rights but was met with opposition from the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) and Retford &amp; Worksop Boat Club, who were supported by Nottinghamshire County Council, East Retford District Council, Doncaster Rural District Council and the Labour Member of Parliament Nigel Spearing.

In the face of such opposition, the clause to remove navigation rights was removed, although the act still contained proposals for unspecified drainage works which might &quot;interfere with or obstruct the right of navigation.&quot; Two fixed weed screens across the river were proposed, as well as replacing the final section of river with a pumping station with culverts into the Trent. The IWA continued to negotiate, and an agreement was eventually reached that the weed screens would not block the entire channel. Because the pumping station was thought to be essential, the Trent River Authority agreed to provide a slipway for trailable boats, which was built near Haxey Gate Bridge.

On 2 December 1971, the government outlined proposals to replace the existing river authorities with water authorities, as part of what would become the Water Act 1973. There would be a new responsibility on such authorities, who would &quot;be placed under an obligation when constructing major works to develop amenities and assist the provision of facilities...&quot; The immediate plans for the pumping station were shelved.

Retford &amp; Worksop Boat Club organised two cruises of the river in 1972, one in April when ten boats reached Bawtry, and one in October, when 15 boats entered the river, but could not pass shallows at Misson. Such cruises became an annual event, and 18 or 19 boats reached Bawtry in 1975, with one continuing on to Mattersey. The boat club thus represented boating interests when the new Severn Trent Water Authority revived plans for a pumping station, and the solution adopted was to provide a second sluice nearer to Misterton Soss, which would allow the river to discharge by gravity for most of the time, with the pumps only being operated under extreme flood conditions.

The pumping station and second sluice were built in 1981, some west of the entrance sluice. Both sluice gates can be raised to the same level as the underside of Haxey Gate Bridge, and the cills are at river bed level. The river level was then maintained at above ordnance datum, and the river was dredged to provide at least of water up to Bawtry. This resulted in significantly less weed growing, which had previously hindered summer cruises.

With the passing of the Water Act 1989 responsibility for rivers, including the Idle, passed to the National Rivers Authority. Their Recreation Officer stated in 1990 that there was no public right of navigation on the Idle, although the Retford and Worksop Boat Club were allowed to cruise on it once a year. A request to allow other boat clubs to use it was subsequently accepted.

The National Rivers Authority was replaced by the Environment Agency in 1996, who issued a statement regarding navigation. This acknowledged that there was a common law right of navigation from the Trent to Bawtry, and along the River Ryton as far as Blyth. It also stated that there was a statutory right of navigation from Bawtry to East Retford, as a result of the Idle Navigation Act 1719, even though the improvement works on that section of the river were never carried out.

However, in addition to requiring 48 hours notice to enter or leave the river, the Environment Agency imposed prohibitive charges to pass through the sluice gates in 2011. These were set at £185 for each transit, and effectively meant that boats could only afford to enter the river in convoys. This way of restricting navigation on a river is legally questionable as a legal case from 1702 (&quot;The King v Clark&quot;) stated that the taking of money to let people pass on a navigable river was against Magna Carta clause 23, which could only be negated by an act of Parliament specifically granting such a right. The charges have not been challenged in court however.

Although the Environment Agency maintains the river, there is no navigation authority for the Idle. There has been some speculation as to what the position would be if the Canal and River Trust became the navigation authority for Environment Agency waters. The Environment Agency has also suggested that the river outfall might be reverted to gravity drainage, by leaving the pumping station sluice open and routinely opening the final sluice at low tide. Newman has suggested that access to the river could be significantly enhanced by the construction of a channel between the river and the Chesterfield Canal at West Stockwith, which would avoid the need for boats to navigate through the sluices, and effectively separate the drainage and navigation functions of the river mouth.

===Drainage===

The banks of the river below Bawtry have been raised so that the river acts as a high level carrier for the drainage of the surrounding land. The area between the river and the Chesterfield Canal to the south and the Warping Drain to the north is drained by a network of drainage ditches, which are connected to the river by sluices and pumping stations. Water is pumped from the ditches to avoid flooding of agricultural land, although the pumping station at Gringley can operate in reverse, supplying water to the ditches for irrigation when required.

The outflow into the River Trent is controlled by a pumping station and two sluices. A vertical sluice gate protects the entrance to the Idle, and the pumping station and another sluice are situated further back. When the water level in the Trent is low, the sluice gates allow water to leave the Idle by gravity, but at high tide, four electric pumps are used to pump the outflow into the space between the sluice gates until it can again discharge by gravity. The pumping station was commissioned in 1981, and was the largest all-electric pumping station in Britain at the time. When all four pumps are operating, it can discharge 2,124 tons per minute (3,059 Mld). This was part of the larger River Idle Improvements Scheme, a project completed in 1982 to improve flood defences and land drainage on the lower River Idle.
The pumping station can pump around half of the peak flood flow of the river. When this is not sufficient to cope with the volume of water, there are two major areas within the Idle Washlands where the water spills over spill weirs to flood the surrounding land. Both can hold over , and are therefore classed as reservoirs under the terms of the Reservoirs Act 1975. They are located to the east of Misson, on either side of Slaynes Lane, and to the west of Misson at North Carr Drain, between the river and Line Bank.
A large drainage ditch called The Mother Drain runs parallel to the lower river for the final . This was authorised by the Everton, etc. (Nottinghamshire) Drainage, etc. Act 1796 (36 Geo 3 c. 99) and constructed between 1796 and 1801 by the engineer Thomas Dyson, to collect water from the low-lying land to the south of the river. Vermuyden&#x27;s single sluice was replaced by a triple sluice at this time. The Mother Drain was pumped into the river by two pumping stations at Misterton Soss, the first example of steam engines being used for land drainage outside of the Fens. The Mother Drain ran from Bawtry to Misterton, although it was authorised to continue to the Trent, and in 1812 William Jessop recommended completing the works and installing a steam pumping engine at the exit sluice. The drain was extended in 1816, but it was 1828 before the pumping engine was added.

At Misterton Soss, the first station, called &quot;Kate&quot;, was built in 1828 and used a beam engine to drive a scoop wheel. The wheel was replaced by a centrifugal pump in 1890, and the beam engine was replaced by a twin cylinder steam engine in 1895. The second, called &quot;Ada&quot;, was built in 1839, and another scoop wheel was powered by a beam engine supplied by Booth &amp; Co, who were based at Park Ironworks in Sheffield. Both became redundant in 1941, when the drainage system was re-organised to feed excess water to a new pumping station at Gringley, containing two Ruston diesel engines driving Gwynnes pumps. By 1910, there was a bridge at this point which included tide gates, similar to the V-gates of a lock, which were designed to shut as the level in the River Trent rose. Both the north and the south pumping station are Grade II* listed buildings, and the south building carries an inscribed stone stating &quot;These works erected 1828, Francis Raynes, George Kelk, William Gauntley (Commissioners), Alfred Smith, Engineer&quot;. They have been saved from dereliction by being converted to residences, their function performed by the modern electric pumping station at Gringley, while the tide gates have been replaced by the vertical sluice at the entrance to the river.

The low-lying region to the south of the Mother Drain was managed by the Everton Internal Drainage Board, who maintained around of watercourses. The Board was formally established in 1945, but was the successor to a similar body established in 1796. As a result of the 1941 reorganisation, the flow in the Mother Drain was reversed. Another pumping station was constructed at Scaftworth. The Gringley pumping station was upgraded in 2005 when electric pumps and an automatic weedscreen cleaner were installed.

On the north side of the river, drainage was managed by the Finningley Internal Drainage Board, who were responsible for the maintenance of of drains and ditches, which fed surplus water to four pumping stations. Langholme, which is just above Haxey Gate bridge, and Idle Stop pumping stations are situated on the banks of the Idle, while Newington pumping station is set further back on the Austerfield Drain. The fourth pumping station is at Park Drain, on the northern edge of the IDB area, and feeds into the Warping Drain, which joins the River Trent at Owston Ferry. Since April 2012, the pumping stations have been managed by the much larger Doncaster East Internal Drainage Board, formed by the amalgamation of the Finningley IDB with six other internal drainage boards.

Above Idle Stop, the river flows through an area where drainage was the responsibility of the Rivers Idle and Ryton Internal Drainage Board. The IDB was re-formed in 1987, its responsibilities having previously been performed by the Severn Trent Water Authority, and managed of watercourses. Those to the west of the Idle drain into the river by gravity at a number of locations, but the region to the east of the river and to the north of Retford drains to a single outfall at Wiseton, where a pumping station pumps the water into the river when river levels are too high for gravity flow.

In April 2011, the Rivers Idle and Ryton IDB amalgamated with the Isle of Axholme IDB, Garthorpe IDB and Everton IDB, to become the Isle of Axholme and North Nottinghamshire Water Level Management Board. The move was initiated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), who saw this and other similar amalgamations as a way to increase efficiency, and to allow them to better support Local Flood Authorities.

===Navigation===

The river is navigable for around from West Stockwith to Bawtry. The fourth edition of &quot;Inland Waterways of Great Britain&quot;, published in 1962 stated that the river was navigable as far as Bawtry for boats with a draught of , and that smaller boats could continue upstream for a further . However, after the demolition of Misterton Soss, few boats could reach Bawtry, and those that attempted to make the journey reported that there were obstructions on the river bed. Boats could only enter the river when the falling tide on the Trent was level with the water in the Idle.

Since the drainage works of 1981, access to the Idle is through the two sluice gates at the mouth of the river, and the Environment Agency requires 48 hours notice of intent to enter it and the payment of a £185 toll. Most boaters that enter the river therefore do so as part of a group, so that the cost can be shared. The space between the two sluices is effectively used as a very large lock, capable of holding a number of boats. Entrance through the first sluice is only possible for an hour either side of high tide. The Environment Agency also require all boaters to sign an indemnity form, which absolves them of any responsibility for loss or damage to boats.

Boats using the river can reach Bawtry bridge. Size is restricted to , with a draft of and headroom of . There are no public moorings. Large boats can turn round with care either side of Bawtry bridge, and at the point where the River Ryton joins the Idle. Above this point, the river can be navigated by canoes all the way from its source. Access to the river can be gained from a bridge over the River Meden some above the junction with the River Maun, where the Idle starts.

The river also provides water for the Chesterfield Canal. A feeder was constructed in the 1770s, which left the river some above the Retford aqueduct, so that water could flow by gravity to the canal. This arrangement was replaced by an electric pumping station at the foot of the aqueduct in the 1970s.

===Course===
The river is largely rural in character, although it passes through the centre of Retford and skirts the south-eastern fringe of Bawtry.

Bawtry bridge, which carries the A631 road to Gainsborough over the river, was constructed in 1810 by Mr Flavel of Wetherby, at a cost of £3,000. It consists of a large central arch flanked by a slightly smaller arch on both sides. The road was widened in 1940, by extending the bridge on its south side, but retains its original character because the south facade was carefully removed and reused to face the new construction.





===Water quality===
Water quality in the Idle is moderate on The Environment Agency&#x27;s GQA scale. The tributaries of the Idle are rated at &#x27;C&#x27; on the GQA scale, because they pass through urban areas, and there are significant discharges to the rivers from sewage treatment works. The average flow in the River Maun is around 13 Mld (megalitres per day) in dry weather, which is supplemented by Mansfield sewage treatment works, which discharges nearly 23 Mld. Water quality does not improve in the Idle, and remains at &#x27;C&#x27; on the GQA scale all the way to the Trent. The Environment Agency maintains gauging stations to measure the flow in the river near the junction with the River Poulter, and to the east of Mattersey.

In 2019 the water quality of the River Idle system was measured as follows by The Environment Agency.
The reasons given for the poor water quality include sewage discharge affecting most of the river, ground water abstraction, and poor management of agricultural and rural land adjacent to the river system. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

===Flooding===

Most of the land surrounding the river is a broad flood plain. As such, the Idle has a long history of flooding towns and villages adjacent to it, as well as agricultural land. The Environment Agency maintains a river gauge at Ordsall (Gauge ID: 4164) where the river has historically measured depths of between 0.19m and 0.85m for 90% of the time since monitoring began. The highest level recorded at this location was on Wednesday 27 June 2007 at 10:30am when the river measured 1.65m. This was at the apex of the 2007 floods. There is a further gauge at Mattersey (Gauge ID: 4015) where the usual depth of the Idle is between 0.55m and 2.70m. The highest level ever recorded at this gauge is 2.81m, which was on Tuesday 26 June 2007 at 10:15pm.

Many floods are recorded in the historical record including:
* 1775 a &#x27;Great Flood&#x27; destroyed a house in Retford.
* 1795 flood of Retford. The Nottingham Journal said: &quot;The flood came on so sudden at Retford on Tuesday night, that great numbers of the inhabitants had no time to remove their effects, and several of them have received very considerable losses by it. It was three feet high in the Market-place, and the torrent ran so strong as to tear up the pavement in different parts of the town, which was nearly all under water. At West Retford a grocer&#x27;s shop, and part of Miss Hurst&#x27;s house were washed down, and four other houses were nearly destroyed, and their inhabitants preserved with the greatest difficulty.&quot;
* 1872 &quot;serious floods on 4 April and two other dates&quot; in Retford.
* 1886 a &#x27;Great Flood&#x27; which caused considerable damage on 8 December in Retford. The council demolished West Retford bridge, which was narrow and had five arches, replacing it with a new wide girder bridge to improve the flow of water.
* 1922 Flood.
* 1930 Flood.
* 2007, a few low-lying parts Retford were affected by the 2007 United Kingdom floods. The majority of Kings Park was flooded under three feet of water. The Asda and Morrisons supermarkets adjacent to the river were also flooded.
* 2019 Retford along with the surrounding areas suffered extensive flooding along the Idle flood plain, including in the centre of the town where the Idle crosses King&#x27;s Park and around the Idle bridge in Ordsall. The local hedgehog rescue centre was flooded, with locals having to rally round to save 70 rescue hedgehogs.
* 2020 there was flooding at Grove Lane and Blackstope Lane with 31 properties affected after a month&#x27;s worth of rain fell in 24 hours.
* 2021 there was flooding on low-lying land along the course of the Idle near Victoria Road, Retford which is currently used for allotments. This resulted in another call for action against flooding which has been partly attributed to building on the natural flood plain. Restoration of the flood plain has been one solution suggested to address the issue.

===Conservation and wildlife===

The River Idle now forms the eastern boundary of the Idle Valley Nature Reserve, with redundant gravel quarries to the west of the river creating wetland areas. Much of the reserve was formerly part of an active quarrying operation, which began in the mid-1940s and was run by the construction group Tarmac from 1981 until 2011. Tarmac sold part of the quarry to the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust in 1989, donating further land in 2009 as it wound down its quarrying operations. The reserve was extended even further when land was acquired from Hanson Quarries and when the settling lagoons of EDF Energy&#x27;s pulverised fuel ash disposal plant were closed in the 1990s and became part of the reserve.

The reserve now comprises a total of making it the largest of the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust&#x27;s reserves, one of the largest nature conservation sites in the East Midlands and the largest wetland area in Nottinghamshire. Some of the Idle Valley Nature Reserve have been designated as an SSSI since 2002. The area supports a wide variety of wildlife, birds and fish, including many endangered species. Parts of the Mother Drain at Misterton are a designated SSSI because they support an exceptional variety of invertebrates.

Between Bawtry Bridge and Idle Stop there are four geographically separated washlands which together form the Idle Washlands Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Each of them consists of floodplain grazing marsh, and contains wet and dry grassland, open water, swamp and fen. They are located at Bawtry-Newington, Mission West, Mission East and Idle Stop. They were designated because of the plants found within them, but are also notable because they provide habitat for large numbers of breeding and over-wintering birds. of washland were designated in 1972, but following the completion of the River Idle Improvement Scheme in 1982, which improved flood defences and land drainage along the river corridor, regular winter flooding of the washlands was reduced, and the SSSI was reduced to in 1983. Some work was subsequently carried out under the National Environment Programme to ensure that the wildfowl and wader habitat was not lost completely, and the Environment Agency produced a water level management plan to further protect the area.

In early 2013, Heidelberg Materials UK, who have extracted sand and gravel near Newington and Misson for over 30 years, restored of the site to benefit wildlife, creating an area of wet grassland. This was extended in 2019 when they created of reedbed and another of wet grassland. The project included a viewing platform to allow visitors to see the restored site and its wildlife. A further of land which was formerly Misson Quarry were restored for agriculture, shielded around its edges by 2500 new trees and of hedgerows. Hansons will continue to be responsible for the management of the habitat for 26 years.

The Idle burst its banks in the Idle Washlands following heavy rainfall in November 2019. Water levels rose almost to the top of the flood banks, and took a long time to subside. This resulted in some excellent wetland habitat forming, particularly near Slaynes Lane, to the west of Misson. Fields to the north of the river and Newington Quarry were inundated, with the water stretching almost to Bawtry Road. Although recording of bird numbers was hampered by the Covid-19 lockdown, some local bird-watchers were legitimately able to visit the area, and 160 different species were recorded during 2020.

====Birds====
The Idle Valley Reserve has recorded over 250 species of birds and it is known for its breeding populations of great crested grebe, shoveler and tufted duck, as well as its starling murmurations. A variety of wetland birds can also be found in the flood plain area towards Bawtry and Misson, and the river itself holds ducks and swans. During 2020, record numbers of swans were observed on the Slaynes Lane washlands, with the number of Mute Swans reaching a peak of 180 on 5 May, and 474 Whooper Swans counted on 1 January.

====Eels====
The River Idle is an important habitat for eels but due to modification of the Idle&#x27;s channels to prevent flooding and allow for navigation, many stretches of river were blocked with man-made structures which young eels found difficult and sometimes impossible to navigate. In 2018 a new eel pass was installed by Aquatic Control Engineering, which was designed to enable young eels to move safely between the River Idle and Belmoor Lake at the Idle Valley Nature Reserve. The structure effectively provides a safe, wet, gradual slope so that young eels can move out of the river into the lake where they can grow until it&#x27;s time for them to breed. Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust&#x27;s Erin McDaid said: “We are hopeful that it will boost eel numbers at the Idle Valley in the long-term and that these important fish will recover in number along the River Idle and throughout the Trent Valley.”

====Fish====
Fish commonly found in the Idle include trout, chub, northern pike, common barbel and European perch. Derbyshire County Angling Club have the fishing rights for the 3 miles of river to Hallcroft, Retford. Scunthorpe Anglers have a 1.25 miles stretch at Lound.

A report by the Wild Trout Trust in 2011 noted that the River Idle had been subjected to a major land drainage scheme during the 1980s during which the channel had been widened and deepened, creating &quot;a uniform, trapezoidal cross-section with flood embankments following the river’s course on each bank&quot;. This was said to have had a &quot;substantial detrimental effect upon riverine habitat&quot; by creating &quot;an impoverished in-stream habitat, lacking a diversity of depth, flow velocities and bed substrate&quot;. The report noted this was reflected in the impoverished fish community. The report recommended a range of measures to improve the environment for fish, and particularly trout.

====Otters====
By the Environment Agency&#x27;s Fifth Otter Survey of England (2009–10), otters were said to be &quot;now widely distributed on the Idle&quot;. The reintroduction of beavers at the Idle Valley Nature reserve was in part to improve the environment for otters, while the work done to improve eel numbers in the Idle is also critical for otter numbers as they are a major food source for otters.

<doc id="446806" wikidata="Q7337626" url="?curid=446806" title="River Maun">
<text>The River Maun is a river in Nottinghamshire, England. Its source lies in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, and from there it flows north east through Mansfield (which takes its name from the river), Edwinstowe and Ollerton, these being the heart of the Sherwood Forest area. It becomes known as Whitewater near the village of Walesby and connects to the River Meden temporarily where the Robin Hood Way crosses them. They diverge, and near Markham Moor it merges again with the River Meden this time becoming the River Idle. Its main tributaries are Rainworth Water, Vicar Water and Cauldwell Water.

The river has been an important source of power, from at least 1086, when there was a watermill in Mansfield. A big increase in the number of mills began in the 1780s, when the frame knitting industry was decimated by the advent of Richard Arkwright&#x27;s water-powered spinning frame. William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, encouraged the building of textile mills to relieve unemployment and poverty. Most were converted to do &quot;cotton doubling&quot;, and several later became hosiery mills. The conversion of watermills which had formerly ground corn to textile mills led to the building of windmills to carry on milling corn. Although water power has largely ceased, there is still an operational water-mill at Ollerton.

==Course==
The river rises on the north side of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, just to the south of Sutton Parkway railway station. It is a little above the contour at this point. It crosses under the railway line, and there are two short culverted sections as it crosses under the B6022 road, to emerge in the Maun Valley Industrial Park. Passing under the B6139 and the A617 roads, it feeds King&#x27;s Mill Reservoir. The reservoir was once a medieval mill pond, but in 1837, William Bentinck, the fourth Duke of Portland agreed with the millers who leased mills further down the river that a large head of water was required to maintain the water supply throughout the year. He built a dam, and of farmland were flooded, some of which he bought from the Unwin family. The work was completed by 1839, when rates to be paid by the millers were agreed, which were to be reduced after 20 years. A walk has been created around the lake, from where some of the waterfowl which live on it can be seen. It is also used for sailing. At the exit from the reservoir, the river is crossed by Kings Mill viaduct, built around 1819 for the Mansfield and Pinxton Railway. The engineer for the project was Josias Jessop, and the bridge was the location for the opening ceremony of the railway. A local newspaper described it as &quot;the beautiful five-arched bridge, constructed under the direction of Mr. Jessop, the engineer&quot;, when reporting the opening. The central arch carries the date 1817. It was adapted for locomotive traffic in 1847, was restored in 1990, and is a grade II listed structure. It is now used as a footpath, as the railway line was historically diverted around it.

The diverted railway line forms part of the Robin Hood Line, which crosses another millpond just below the reservoir. This supplied the late eighteenth century Hermitage Mill, originally a textile mill, which was then used as a building-materials depot, but has been disused for many years. After crossing under some minor roads and Sheepbridge Lane, where there was another eighteenth-century textile mill, repurposed as a joinery works, and then an internet gaming centre the river is spanned by the disused Drury Dam railway viaduct, this one built in 1875, and consisting of ten round arches, constructed of brick and rock-faced stone. At its west end, a cast-iron arch carries it over Quarry Lane. It is grade II listed, was restored in 1989, and is used as a footpath. Part of it spans the Quarry Lane local nature reserve, on the south bank of the river, where a sculpture created by Lewis Morgan was installed in December 2009. The river continues to weave through the east of Mansfield, where it has been culverted in places. At Bridge Street, the former Town Mill public house was originally the mill owner&#x27;s house adjacent to the watermill, built around 1775, and restored in the late twentieth century. To the north of the B6033 Bath Lane, there is a disused textile mill, built between 1822 and 1831, which used water power. W. Goldie and Co. extended it in 1880, and altered it to work as a hosiery mill, which it continued to be until 1984. Part of it has been re-used as apartments. Next, the river passes through Carr Bank, with woodland to the east, and a large sewage treatment works to the west. The outflow from the works contributes a significant portion of the flow below this point.

After passing under the A6117 road, the river enters Maun Valley Park, a local nature reserve covering , which includes water meadows and other wetland habitats. New Mill Lane lies at its northern edge, after which the river passes through more rural scenery. Approaching Clipstone, Cavendish Woods lie to the south east, while extensive fish ponds are located on the other bank. Vicar Water, which flows northwards from Vicar Park, joins on the east bank, before the river is crossed by a railway at Clipstone Junction. It flows eastwards to the south of Edwinstowe, to be joined on the western edge of Ollerton by Rainworth Water, flowing northwards from Rufford Abbey. To the east of the A614 road is Ollerton Watermill, which is still operational, and is open to the public on Sundays in the summer. Passing to the west of New Ollerton, the river flows northwards through open countryside to join the River Meden. After a short distance, two channels are created by a weir, the southern one still called the River Maun, and both proceed eastwards, before turning northwards near Markham Moor roundabout on the A1 road, and joining again to form the River Idle. There are two disused water mills on this stretch, one at Haughton and one called Jacket Mill at Rockley. There were two water mills in Haughton in the reign of King Edward III, during the fourteenth century. Jacket Mill is of red brick construction, and much of it dates from the late eighteenth century, although parts were altered in the nineteenth century.

== Mills ==
The river has provided an important source of power in the past. The Domesday book, produced in 1086, mentions that Mansfield had a watermill, and there are many references to watermills thereafter. In 1292, a fulling mill is mentioned. This was situated to the north of the town, probably near to the later Stanton&#x27;s Mill, and was part of the process for making woollen cloth.

Mansfield had a cottage industry, which by 1800 consisted of around 700 knitting frames. It operated as a social service, as most of the workers were either orphaned children, or children from families who would otherwise be destitute. Following the invention of the &quot;water-frame&quot;, a spinning frame that was powered by a water wheel, which had been invented by Richard Arkwright in 1771 and used in his mills at Cromford, the cottage industry could not compete, and there was widespread unemployment and poverty in Mansfield. In an attempt to remedy the situation, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland, who was the landowner, and who later became Home Secretary, organised a programme of building water-powered spinning mills along the river. Hermitage Mill was the first to be built, in 1782, and still stands on Hermitage lane. Little Matlock Mill was built three years later on Sheepbridge Lane, and again still stands. Field Mill on Nottingham Road was converted to work with cotton in 1785. Immediately above it was Drury Mill, a corn mill run by Daniel Drury, but this had to be closed in 1791 when the water level in Field Mill Dam was raised, preventing Drury&#x27;s wheel from working efficiently. Field Mill was in use as a leather works by 1916 and was demolished in 1925.

The next mill on the river was Town Mill, which had been built in 1744, and was used for grinding corn and malt. The miller, William Smith, negotiated with the Duke, and in 1785 he sold the corn milling equipment and refitted it for working with cotton. Having also refitted Field Mill in the autumn, he started a Sunday School in 1786, so that his young workers would be equipped with basic reading and mathematical skills, as well as moral instruction. The practice spread, and Mansfield became known for the good education of its young people. Town Mill became Old Town Mill in 1870, when a steam-powered mill was built to the east of the river, which became known as New Town Mill. Stantons Mill, the next downstream, was built in 1795. By 1900, it had been taken over by Luke Weatherall, who made workmen&#x27;s boots there. The final textile mill on the river in Mansfield at the time was Bath Mill, on Bath Lane, which began operation in 1792 producing worsted cloth. Benjamin Bagshaw, John Radford and George Simes were the men behind the venture, but it was not a success, and the mill had become a cotton mill by 1800, when it also became one of the first locations in the vicinity to install a steam engine. One effect of the conversion of mills for cotton, rather than grinding corn, was that a number of windmills were built, since corn still had to be milled into flour. The number of windmills in Mansfield rose from three to thirteen between 1774 and 1824.

To the south of Mansfield, the Maun is joined by Cauldwell Water at Bleakhills. Charles and George Stanton chose Bleakhills as a suitable site for a new mill in 1795, and negotiated with the Duke of Portland for permission to build both the mill and cottages for the workers. The cost was about £300.
By 1887, most of the textile mills, including Bleakhills Mill, were marked on maps a being &quot;cotton doubling&quot; mills, a process in which multiple strands of cotton were wound together to form thicker threads. In 1899, only Field Mill and Bath Mill were still marked in this way. Most of the rest were then marked &quot;Hosiery&quot;, although Stanton Mill was marked &quot;Boot and Shoe&quot;.

There were other mills besides the textile mills. Between Field Mill and Town Mill, there was an iron foundry, called Meadow Foundry, which was built by William Bradshaw and John Sansom in 1852. The site had previously been occupied by a water-powered bark mill, and remained in the ownership of the Duke of Portland. In 1867, Bradshaw and Sansom negotiated a new 14-year lease with the Duke, which included the supply of water from King&#x27;s Mill reservoir, but they became bankrupt during the following year. It was taken over by James Bownes, who formed a limited company to operate it, and it remained in use until 1960, when the firm moved to new premises, and the site was redeveloped by the Mansfield Brewery. Below the foundry was Borough Mills, which operated as a saw mill. Between Town Mills and Stanton Mill was the Rock Valley Mill, which was operated by Dickenson Ellis as a mustard mill in the early nineteenth century. It was taken over by David Cooper Barringer in 1839, who formed Barringer and Company to operate it. In 1873, they decided to pack the mustard in decorated tin boxes, instead of wooden ones, and made the boxes on site from pre-printed metal sheet. Soon they were making tin boxes for other companies, and the separate Rock Valley Tin Works was formed in 1889. Three years later, a printing works was established, to print the metal sheets, and it became a limited company in 1895. Following several takeovers, it remains in business as Carnaud Metal Box Engineering.

==Water Quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail. The Maun is designated as &quot;heavily modified&quot;, which means that the channels have been altered by human activity, and the criteria for this designation are defined by the Water Framework Directive.

The water quality of the Maun and its tributaries was as follows in 2019.

Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The woolly monkeys are the genus Lagothrix of New World monkeys, usually placed in the family Atelidae.

Both species in this genus originate from the rainforests of South America. They have prehensile tails and live in relatively large social groups.

==Taxonomy==
The following 2 species and 5 subspecies are currently considered to be within the genus:




==Description==
Woolly monkeys are closely related to spider monkeys. They have a thick brown coat with dark gray appendages. The stomach area is black and heads are light brown. The fur color is the same for both males and females. Variation in color exist among subspecies. A prehensile tail assists in climbing and fulfills many functions of an opposable thumb. Arm and legs are about equal in length. All species are large, weighing around . Males weigh 45% more than females on average but are of equal length.

==Habitat and social behaviour==

Woolly monkeys are found throughout the northern countries of South America (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Peru). They usually reside in high-elevation cloud forests, seasonally flooded rainforests, and forests which are situated within Colombia&#x27;s eastern plains region, although their ideal habitat is humid and mature tropical forests.

The species lives in social groups ranging from 5 to 45 individuals. Foraging groups, however, tend to consist of two to six individuals which branch out from the main group, which is probably intended to reduce food competition between individuals. Woolly monkey diets consist of fruit with an addition of leaves, seeds, flowers, and invertebrates. Each group is governed and led by an alpha male, and the social organization within a larger group is organized by age, sex, and the reproductive status of females. Reproduction in these groups is characterized by promiscuity; one male (either the alpha or subordinate) mates with more than one female, just as females mate with more than one male. Shortly after the females reach maturity, they leave their natal groups to avoid any occurrence of inbreeding, while males tend to remain in their natal groups.

Play not only serves as a bonding process to rekindle relationships among individuals, but is also a way the species establishes a hierarchy or social pecking order, as well as passive food sharing, which is also considered a common routine in the species. Woolly monkeys have an elaborate system of vocalization and olfactory, visual, and tactile communication. These can be used to coordinate group activities, indicate aggression, affection, and marking, and establish territories.

==Predation and preservation==
Woolly monkeys are hunted by a variety of species of eagles and cats, such as the jaguar. Their main predators, however, are humans, who hunt the species both for food and for the illegal pet trade. Habitat encroachment is also threatening the survival of the species; all these factors are believed to be the cause of the species&#x27; recent decline. Woolly monkeys are now considered highly endangered, and captive individuals are bred to ensure the survival of the species as part of the International Breeding Program for Endangered Species.

<doc id="446809" wikidata="Q7337627" url="?curid=446809" title="River Meden">
<text>The River Meden is a river in Nottinghamshire, England. Its source lies just north of Huthwaite, near the Derbyshire border, and from there it flows north east through Pleasley and Warsop before merging temporarily with the River Maun near Bothamsall. The rivers divide after a short distance and go on separately to a point near Markham Moor where they once more combine to form the River Idle.

The river was a source of water power for mills in Pleasley Vale from the 1760s until the 1980s. Three huge cotton mills and their associated mill ponds still dominate the Vale. The buildings were bought by Bolsover District Council in 1992, and have become a centre for light industry. On a much smaller scale was the water mill at Warsop, which still retains much of its internal machinery.

==Route==
The river rises as two main streams to the north of Huthwaite, above the contour, on the coal measures that run along the western edge of Nottinghamshire. Both are crossed by dismantled railway lines, before they unite and flow in a north-easterly direction to the north of Stanton Hill and Skegby. After crossings by two more redundant railways, the river is joined by a stream which flows from the Car Ponds on the edge of the Hardwick Hall estate. The county boundary between Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire follows the course of the stream, and continues along the river as it passes to the south of Pleasley and under the A617 road. Just before the bridge are two large ponds, the second one constrained by a grade II listed dam, long by wide, with vertical wooded sluice gates on the upstream side. The adjacent two-arched bridge was built in 1800, although it was modified somewhat in the twentieth century, and its function has been partially superseded by the A617 bypass. Next the river passes through &quot;Pleasley Vale&quot;, where the water has cut through the underlying limestone escarpment to form a deep, narrow valley, much of which is wooded. Several mill buildings were constructed here out of local limestone. Two large mill ponds remain, with two mill buildings, while a third building is located on a stream which flows from the north to join the Meden at this point.

After passing under the Robin Hood Line, which runs from Worksop to Nottingham, the county border leaves the river, which continues in a north-easterly direction. Beyond the B6407 Sookholme Road bridge, it is joined by The Bottoms, which rises in Mansfield Woodhouse and flows northwards to the junction. The freight line to Shirebrook crosses the river, and also crosses Sookholme Brook, which has two sources near Shirebrook, and after they have joined, flows parallel to the Meden to its junction near Warsop Vale. The river passes between Church Warsop and Market Warsop, where it is crossed by the A60 road. Just below the bridge is Warsop watermill, much of which dates from 1767. The building is grade II listed, and internally, the machinery and rolling mill date from the nineteenth century. There is also an early twentieth century water turbine. The mill bridge and weir are also listed structures. Turning eastwards, the river passes through Budby and into Thoresby Park, where it has been dammed to form a large ornamental lake called Thoresby Lake. The difference in height between the lake and the river below it at the eastern end was sufficient for Earl Manvers, the owner of Thoresby Hall, to install two water turbines in 1941. They were supplied by Newtons of Derby and were of 22 kVA and 5 kVA capacity. The electricity generated supplied the hall. The generator house was demolished in the late 20th century.
Below the lake, the river passes the hamlet of Perlethorpe, to be joined by the River Maun, flowing northwards, and here called &quot;Whitewater&quot;. The Robin Hood Way, a long-distance footpath, crosses soon afterwards, and a weir creates two channels again, the south one deemed to be the Maun and the north one the Meden. They remain roughly parallel as they are crossed by the B6387 road near Bothamsall, a freight railway and the Robin Hood Way again. They diverge to the west of Markham Moor roundabout on the A1 road, pass under the road, and combine to form the River Idle. Just below the junction, the River Poulter swells the flow.

==Mills==
The river near Pleasley Vale has been utilised to provide power since at least 1767, when two forges and a corn mill are known to have been operating. The forges were run by George Sitwell, and were called Nether and Upper forge. The engineered river channel made it a good site for further development, and a consortium of businessmen from Nottingham and drapers from Mansfield leased the vale and Pleasley Park in 1782, in order to construct water-powered cotton mills. The Upper Mill (now called Mill 1) was built first, on the site of the previous corn mill, and was operational by 1785. The Lower Mill (now Mill 3) was completed seven years later at a cost of £1,190, and was much bigger. A manager&#x27;s house and a row of ten houses for the workers were also completed in 1792. The mills supplied cotton to the expanding East Midland hosiery industry. One of the original three businessmen was Henry Hollins, and by the early 18th century, the mills were run by William Hollins and Co. They were the first and one of the most successful cotton producers in the East Midlands.
The Hollins family managed the mills for many years, but from the 1830s were joined by the Pagets, who introduced steam power to the mills. Fire destroyed the Upper Mill on 25 December 1840, but it was rebuilt by 1844. The Lower Mill also burnt down, and was replaced in 1847. Newer equipment fitted as part of the rebuilding enabled the mills to stay competitive. William Hollins lived at Pleasley Vale, and oversaw the expansion of the community, with the construction of more houses for the workers, the provision of public facilities including a school, wash house, and a cooperative society, and attention to leisure activities by the establishing of a Mechanics Institute, a library and a cricket club. A company farm was also established. St Chad&#x27;s Chapel and the vicarage were commissioned by Charles Paget in 1876. The chapel was opened in 1881, but was reputedly built in 1861 at Stuffynwood, Derbyshire, and later moved to its present site. It has a small bell turret at its western end, and a number of its features mimic thirteenth and fourteenth century styles. Internally, there is a brass memorial to Paget and his wife Helen Elizabeth.

From the 1890s, the mills produced Viyella, a mixture of cotton with Merino wool, which produces a soft fabric. They continued to flourish, as various extensions show. The Upper Mill was extended in the 1890s, when a fourth storey was added, and again, probably in 1913, when extensions were added to the north and rear. A large combing shed, where cotton fibres were straightened and aligned prior to the production of fabric, was built just below it in 1913. This was a two-storey building, with a single storey wing at the back. It was extended in 1952, when an extra two floors were added to the main shed, and a three-storey block was added at the side. At this point, it became a mill, and is now called Mill 2. The Lower Mill was also extended, but because it was much larger than the Upper Mill when it was built, and the extensions were relatively small, it retains more of its original character. There were 980 workers employed at the site in 1934, but decline gradually set in. The first workers houses were demolished in 1961, to be followed by the school, the baths and the Mechanics Institute. By 1987, production had moved abroad, and the mills closed. Bolsover District Council bought the mill buildings in 1992, using compulsory purchase powers, and they have been revitalised, to be used for light industry and offices. The mill ponds have also survived.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measures water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Meden and its tributaries was as follows in 2019.

Water quality in the upper river has improved but has deteriorated in the lower river, as both were moderate in 2016. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

Most of the park is within North Yorkshire, with a sizeable area in Cumbria and a small part in Lancashire. The park was designated in 1954, and extended in 2016. More than 95% of the land in the park is privately owned; there are over 1,000 farms in this area.

In 2020, the national park was named an International Dark Sky Reserve. This means that the area has &quot;low levels of light pollution with good conditions for astronomy&quot;.

 some 23,500 residents live within the park boundary; a 2018 report estimated that the park attracted more than four million visitors per year. The economy consists primarily of tourism and agriculture.

==Location==
The park is north-east of Manchester; Otley, Ilkley, Leeds and Bradford lie to the south, while Kendal is to the west, Darlington to the north-east and Harrogate to the south-east.

The national park does not include all the Yorkshire Dales. Parts of the dales to the south and east of the national park are located in the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The national park includes the Howgill Fells and Orton Fells in the north west although they are not often considered part of the Dales.

==History==
In 1947, the Hobhouse Report recommended the creation of the Yorkshire Dales National Park covering parts of the West Riding and North Riding of Yorkshire. The proposed National Park included most of the Yorkshire Dales, but not Nidderdale. Accordingly, Nidderdale was not included in the National Park when it was designated in 1954. In 1963 the then West Riding County Council proposed that Nidderdale should be added to the National Park, but the proposal met with opposition from the district councils which would have lost some of their powers to the county council.

Following the Local Government Act 1972 most of the area of the national park was transferred in 1974 to the new county of North Yorkshire. An area in the north west of the national park (Dentdale, Garsdale and the town of Sedbergh) was transferred from the West Riding of Yorkshire to the new county of Cumbria. In 1997 management of the national park passed from the county councils to the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority.

===2016 extension===
A westward extension of the park into Lancashire and Westmorland encompassed much of the area between the old boundaries of the park and the M6 motorway. This increased the area by nearly 24% and brought the park close to the towns of Kirkby Lonsdale, Kirkby Stephen and Appleby-in-Westmorland. The extension also includes the northern portion of the Howgill Fells and most of the Orton Fells. The expansion brought in parts of historic Lancashire and Westmorland to join part of North Yorkshire and the South West part of Cumbria.

==Tourism==

The area has a wide range of activities for visitors. For example, many people come to the Dales for walking or other exercise. Several long-distance routes cross the park, including the Pennine Way, the Dales Way, the Coast to Coast Walk and the Pennine Bridleway. Cycling is also popular and there are several cycleways.

The DalesBus service provides service in the Dales on certain days in summer, &quot;including the Yorkshire Dales National Park and Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot;. In summer, these buses supplement the other services that operate year-round in the Dales.

Tourism in the region declined due to restrictions necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and into 2021. Later in 2021, the volume of visits was expected to increase as a result of the 2020 TV series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, largely filmed within the Dales. The first series aired in the UK in September 2020 and in the US in early 2021. One source stated that visits to Yorkshire websites had increased significantly by late September 2020. By early 2021, the &quot;Discover England&quot; website was using the tag line &quot;Discover &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; in Yorkshire&quot;.

The Dales Countryside Museum is housed in the converted Hawes railway station in Wensleydale in the north of the area. The park also has five visitor centres. These are at:

* Aysgarth Falls
* Grassington
* Hawes
* Malham
* Reeth

<text>The 1868 United Kingdom general election was held between 17 November to 7 December 1868. It saw Gladstone&#x27;s Liberals increase their majority to 116 seats. 

This was the first general election to be held after the passage of the Reform Act 1867, which enfranchised many male householders, thus greatly increasing the number of men who could vote in elections in the United Kingdom. It was the first election held in the United Kingdom in which more than a million votes were cast; nearly triple the number of votes were cast compared to the previous election in 1865.

This was the last general election at which all seats were taken by only the two leading parties, although the parties at the time were loose coalitions and party affiliation was not listed on registration papers.

<text>John Dollond (30 November 1761) was an English optician, known for his successful optics business and his patenting and commercialization of achromatic doublets.

==Biography==
Dollond was the son of a Huguenot refugee, a silk-weaver at Spitalfields, London, where he was born. He followed his father&#x27;s trade, but found time to acquire a knowledge of Latin, Greek, mathematics, physics, anatomy and other subjects. In 1752 he abandoned silk-weaving and joined his eldest son, Peter Dollond (1731–1820), who in 1750 had started in business as a maker of optical instruments; this business went on to become Dollond &amp; Aitchison. His reputation grew rapidly, and in 1761 he was appointed optician to the king.

In 1758 he published an &quot;Account of some experiments concerning the different refrangibility of light&quot;, describing the experiments that led him to the achievement with which his name is specially associated, the discovery of a means of constructing achromatic lenses by the combination of crown and flint glasses, reducing or eliminating chromatic aberration (distortion due to colour fringes). Leonhard Euler in 1747 had suggested that achromatism might be obtained by the combination of glass and water lenses. Relying on statements made by Sir Isaac Newton, Dollond first disputed this possibility (&quot;Phil. Trans.&quot;, 1753), but subsequently, after the Swedish physicist, Samuel Klingenstierna (1698–1765), had pointed out that Newton&#x27;s law of dispersion did not harmonize with certain observed facts, Dollond began experiments to settle the question.

Early in 1757 Dollond succeeded in producing achromatic refraction by the aid of glass and water lenses, and a few months later he made a successful attempt to get the same result by a combination of glasses of different qualities (see History of telescopes). For this achievement the Royal Society awarded him the Copley Medal in 1758, and three years later elected him one of its fellows. Dollond also published two papers on apparatus for measuring small angles (&quot;Phil. Trans.&quot;, 1753, 1754).

In 1761, Dollond became the optician of King George III. He died of apoplexy on 30 November, of that year in London.

==Family==
He married Elizabeth Sommelier in 1729. They had two sons and three daughters. Their daughter, Sarah Dollond, married his neighbour and friend, the mathematician and instrument maker Jesse Ramsden.

==Priority of invention==
A theoretical approach to reduce chromatic aberration was worked out by Leonhard Euler in papers that he published in the Memoires of the Berlin Academy between 1747 and 1753. John Dollond read the paper and conducted experiments to construct an achromatic lens and was the first person to patent the achromatic doublet which was granted on 19 April 1758 for a period of 14 years. However, he was not the first to make such lenses. Optician George Bass, following the instructions of Chester Moore Hall, made and sold such lenses as early as 1733. In the late 1750s, Bass told Dollond about Hall&#x27;s design; Dollond saw the potential and was able to reproduce them.

Dollond appears to have known of the prior work and refrained from enforcing his patent. After his death, his son, Peter, did take action to enforce the patent. A number of his competitors, including Bass, Benjamin Martin, Robert Rew and Jesse Ramsden, took action. Dollond&#x27;s patent was upheld, as the court found that the patent was valid due to Dollond&#x27;s &quot;exploitation&quot; of the invention while prior inventors did not. Several of the opticians were ruined by the expense of the legal proceedings and closed their shops as a result. The patent remained valid until it expired in 1772. Following the expiry of the patent, the price of achromatic doublets in England dropped by half.
