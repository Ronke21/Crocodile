<text>Étienne Maurice Gérard, 1st [[Count|Comte]] Gérard (; 4 April 177317 April 1852) was a distinguished French general and statesman. He served under a succession of French governments including the &quot;ancien regime&quot; monarchy, the Revolutionary governments, the Restorations, the July Monarchy, the First and Second Republics, and the First Empire (and arguably the Second), becoming prime minister briefly in 1834.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born as the son of a royal bailiff at Damvillers, in Lorraine, Gérard joined a battalion of volunteers in 1791, and served in the campaigns of 1792–1793 under Generals Charles François Dumouriez and Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. He first saw real action fighting at the defiles of Argonne and then at Jemappes where his conspicuous bravery earned him promotion to second lieutenant and he was promoted again following his actions at Neerwinden. In the summer of 1794, Gérard joined the 71st demi-brigade and fought at the Battle of Fleurus and then at the capture of Charleroi and Aldenhoven where he rushed through enemy lines to establish a rope across the river to allow the troops to cross the Roer. In 1795, he served Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte as aide-de-camp and the two formed a close friendship. Gérard then followed Bernadotte to Italy where he served under Napoleon&#x27;s command for the first time and was promoted to captain for his actions at Valvasone. In 1799 he fought in Switzerland under the command of André Masséna and he was promoted &quot;chef d&#x27;escadron&quot;, and in 1800 colonel.

===Rise to prominence===
As the Grande Armée marched to war in 1805, Gérard served as first aide-de-camp to Bernadotte and greatly distinguished himself at the battle of Austerlitz where he charged at the head of the French squadrons against the Russian Imperial Guard and was wounded by grapeshot to the thigh. During the war against Prussia in 1806, he fought at Schleiz, Halle, Lübeck and was made Brigadier General in November 1806. Gérard was given command of a brigade in VII Corps which was engaged at Mohrungen and Eylau in early 1807. A month after Eylau, he was transferred to command of 2nd brigade in I Corps which took part in the campaign that June and saw action at Guttstadt-Deppen. When the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out, Gérard was given command of the Saxon cavalry in Bernadotte&#x27;s IX Corps and was so praised for his gallant conduct in the battle of Wagram that he was created a baron of the First French Empire.

In the Spanish campaign of 1810 and 1811, Gérard gained special distinction at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro; and in the expedition to Russia he fought at the battle of Smolensk and the battle of Valutino, and displayed such bravery and ability in the battle of Borodino that he was made &quot;général de division&quot;. He won further distinction in the disastrous retreat from Moscow, fighting at Maloyaroslavets, Krasnoi and with the rearguard at Berezina and Kowno. 

===Campaigns of 1813–1814===
In the campaign of 1813, in command of a division, he took part in the battle of Lützen and at the battle of Bautzen where he was placed in front of the Spree, so as to link up with corps of the extreme right. After ferocious combat, this corps was forced to retreat. Macdonald, judging that this development compromised his vanguard commanded by Gérard, sent him the order to retreat &quot;on the contrary&quot; replied Gérard to the bearer of the order, &quot;instead of withdrawing, we must advance and I will answer for the success of the day&quot;. He then gave orders to attack and the positions were retaken. Gérard continued to serve with Macdonald during his independent operations, at Goldberg he repeated what he had done at Bautzen, ignoring orders to retreat and launching an assault that put the enemy to rout. He then fought at the battle of Leipzig (in which he commanded the XI Corps) where he was gravely wounded. After the battle of Bautzen, he was created by Napoleon a count of the Empire.
In the Campaign in north-east France (1814), he proved to be one of Napoleon&#x27;s most capable and energetic subordinates. Gérard prepared Phalsbourg for defense then took command of a division in II Corps which fought at Brienne and then La Rothière where Gérard demonstrated superb defensive skill by repelling a series of attacks from numerically superior coalition forces on the French right flank. He won still greater distinction at Mormant and Montereau, in which he took over command of II Corps from Marshal Victor. During the final phase of the campaign, Gérard continued to distinguish himself, winning at the bridge of Guillotière, putting himself in the thick of the action at a skirmish around Vendeuvre and fighting with his corps at Saint-Dizier.

===Restoration, Hundred Days and July Revolution===
After the first Bourbon Restoration, he was named by King Louis XVIII Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor and chevalier of St Louis.

During the Hundred Days, as preparations for the Waterloo campaign were underway Gérard vouched for the loyalty of General Bourmont. Bourmont had previously been an ardent royalist and was suspected of being a spy, Bourmont would latter hand Napoleons orders to General Blücher. Napoleon made Gérard a Peer of France and placed him in command of the IV Corps of the Army of the North. In this capacity Gérard took a brilliant part in the battle of Ligny, and on the morning of 18 June he was foremost in advising Marshal Grouchy to march to the sound of the guns to aid the emperor at Waterloo. Having failed in this he took part in the battle of Wavre.

Gérard retired to Brussels after the fall of Napoleon, and did not return to France until 1817. He sat as a member of the Restoration&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies in 1822–1824, and was re-elected in 1827.

Serving as a voice of moderation in the midst of political chaos, Gérard played an active role during the July Revolution of 1830, after which he was appointed minister of war and named a Marshal of France. On account of his health he resigned the office of War Minister in the following October.

===Belgian campaign and later distinctions===

However, in 1831 he took the command of the Northern Army, and was successful in forcing the army of the Netherlands to withdraw from Belgium (&quot;see Belgian Revolution&quot;). In 1832 he commanded the besieging army in the famous siege of the citadel of Antwerp. Gérard was awarded a special ceremonial sword by the grateful Belgians in recognition of his triumph.

He was again chosen war minister in July 1834, and served as Prime Minister of the July Monarchy, but resigned in the following October. In 1836 he was named grand chancellor of the Legion of Honour in succession to Marshal Mortier, and in 1838 commander of the National Guards of the Seine &quot;département&quot;, an office which he held until 1842. He became a senator of the Second Empire in 1852 (before it was formally instituted), and died in the same year, aged 79.

==Marriage and descendants==
Gérard married Rosemonde de Valence in 1816. Their granddaughter was Rosemonde Gérard.

<text>Millwall is a district on the western and southern side of the Isle of Dogs, in east London, England, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It lies to the immediate south of Canary Wharf and Limehouse, north of Greenwich and Deptford, east of Rotherhithe, west of Cubitt Town, and has a long shoreline along London&#x27;s Tideway, part of the River Thames. It was part of the County of Middlesex and from 1889, following the passing of the Local Government Act 1888, the County of London; it later became part of Greater London in 1965.

Millwall had a population of 23,084 in 2011 and includes Island Gardens, The Quarterdeck and The Space.

==History==

Millwall is a smaller area of land than an average parish, as it was part of Poplar until the 19th century when it became heavily industrialised, containing the workplaces and homes of a few thousand dockside and shipbuilding workers. Among its factories were the shipbuilding ironworks of William Fairbairn, much of which survives as today&#x27;s Burrells Wharf. It was in this era also that Millwall F.C. was founded, in 1885, as Millwall Rovers. First nicknamed &#x27;the Dockers&#x27; before becoming &#x27;the Lions&#x27;, the team moved south of the river to New Cross in 1910, however a set of amateur football pitches remain, adjoining Cubitt Town alongside the City Farm that was added in the 20th century.

Originally known as &quot;Marshwall&quot;, the area acquired its new name with its breakaway from its former parish of Poplar. The replacement was due to the large number of windmills built on the river wall in the 18th century. Improvements led by the Lord Mayor William Cubitt in reinforcing the land solved the periodic flooding caused by major snow melt and spring tides. Corn and wheat were brought along the River Thames to be ground into flour there.

On 31 January 1858, the largest ship of that time, the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was launched from Napier Yard, the shipyard leased by Messrs J Scott Russell &amp; Co. The 211 metre (692 ft) length was too wide for the river, and the ship had to be launched sideways. A section of the concrete and timber substructure from the launch site is now preserved on-site for public display at the modern Napier Avenue. Due to the technical difficulties of the launch, this was the last ship of such a size to be built on the island, though other builders such as Yarrows and Samuda Brothers continued building warships on the island for another 50 years. They are commemorated in the names of the Samuda Estate on Manchester Road, and Yarrow House on Stewart Street.
In the 1860s the large Millwall Dock was built, extending from the Thames at Millwall into the centre of the Isle of Dogs. The spoil from the dock was left as the Mudchute.

During the 19th century, the area now called &quot;Island Gardens&quot; was referred to as &quot;North Greenwich&quot;, for the North Greenwich railway station that was opened in 1872 to connect with the ferry that was the forerunner of the Greenwich foot tunnel. The Greenwich peninsula, previously East Greenwich, is now also known by this epithet for the North Greenwich tube station.

Like other parts of the Isle of Dogs, substantial redevelopment has been more or less ongoing since the 1980s, resulting in modern industrial and commercial buildings and hastily constructed contemporary housing beginning to predominate over the remaining early 20th century &quot;two up, two down&quot; semi-detached and terraced homes that housed the dock workers, often overcrowded with occupants. The loss of the docks, the German campaign of bombings in the area, and the gradual disappearance of the manufacturing and distribution industries led to a fall in population during the mid-20th century and ongoing problems for local workers who relied on shipping and manufacturing for employment.

The post-World War II period saw the area become a focus of regeneration programmes on the former industrial land in Millwall. Initially led by Poplar Borough Council (eventually absorbed into Tower Hamlets) and London County Council, regeneration efforts focused on council house building until the 1980s when the London Docklands Development Corporation was created and development shifted to private, even luxury, office and residential buildings. During this period the area&#x27;s population increased significantly following the above-mentioned mid-century drop.

The area is home to a number of council estates including West Ferry Estate, Millwall Estate, Masthouse Terrace, Herperus Crescent Estate and Chapel House Street Estate. The Barkantine Estate, commissioned by the London County Council with the first section opened in 1968, dominates a swathe of the northern section of Millwall.

==Sport==
Millwall is most famous for its football club, Millwall F.C., founded in 1885 as Millwall Rovers. Nicknamed The Dockers (now known as The Lions), the team moved south of the river to New Cross in 1910. Occupying four separate grounds on the Isle of Dogs in the 25 years since its formation as a football club, they now play in Bermondsey and retain the name Millwall despite not having played in the Millwall area for more than 100 years.

Millwall Rugby Club was formed in 1995. The first team plays in the Essex Division 1 league and the seconds are in the Essex Merit Table (Division 2), while the thirds are playing in the Merit Table (Division 5), having won Division 6 last season. They now also have women&#x27;s rugby - the Millwall Venus girls - and a youth section for boys and girls from eight years old.

The Docklands Sailing and Watersports Centre is located at the far west end of the dock where the dock previously connected to the River Thames. It was set up in 1989 by the London Docklands Development Corporation and the Sports Council at a cost of £1.2 million.

==Politics==
Millwall gained some notoriety when, in a council by-election in 1993, Derek Beackon won the British National Party&#x27;s first council seat there. After a major anti-fascist campaign, the BNP lost the seat at the following full council election.

In September 2004, Tower Hamlets&#x27; Respect party fought its second council election in the borough, standing local activist Paul McGarr. In this previously &#x27;solid&#x27; Labour seat, Labour were pushed into third place, and the local Conservative party took its first ever seat on Tower Hamlets council. In the 2006 local elections, the Conservatives took all three seats, defeating former MP Alan Amos.

The Millwall ward was subsequently abolished in 2014, largely replaced by the new wards of Canary Wharf and Island Gardens. These retained the Conservative leanings of the old Millwall ward, and as of 2018 they each have one Conservative and one Labour councillor. These are the only two Conservative councillors on Tower Hamlets council.

==Demographics==
White British people comprise 31% of the population of the Millwall ward of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. This is followed by Other White people (19.9%) and Bangladeshis (14.6%).

45.1% of people living in Millwall were born in England, with a number of other countries represented including Bangladesh (6.8%), India (4.7%), and China (4.3%).

The religious make up of Millwall is 32.1% Christian, 22.0% No religion, 18.0% Muslim, 4.9% Hindu, 1.9% Buddhist, 0.4% Sikh, and 0.4% Jewish.

The gender balance in Millwall is 53% male and 47% female.

==Amenities==
The historical Island Gardens, opened on 3 August 1895 by local politician Will Crooks, is located almost in front of the former Greenwich Hospital, the Cutty Sark, National Maritime Museum and Greenwich Park.

The Ferry House is a pub on Ferry Street has existed since the Tudor period (1485–1603). The present building dates from 1822, and was used as a drinking establishment by ferry passengers to and from Greenwich until the opening of the Greenwich foot tunnel in 1902.

The Ship Inn pub was built in 1835, it is thought by two houses merge into a public house, it has been a pub all its history and is next to Burrells Wharf, where during his time there Isambard Kingdom Brunel may have frequented The Ship. Today it is run by a local, independently run business.

The decision to proceed with the large Barkantine Estate housing estate development was made in March 1965, with first block being opened in 1968, and originally consisted of 634 dwellings. It included a pedestrianized shopping promenade called The Quarterdeck, and a pub called the Tooke Arms, relocated and rebuilt at the same time.

The Space is located inside a former Presbyterian church that was built in 1859 for the Scottish Presbyterian congregation who had migrated to the Isle of Dogs to work in the shipyards, which was designed by Thomas Knightley.

<doc id="450866" wikidata="Q2796929" url="?curid=450866" title="St Osyth">
<text>St Osyth is an English village and civil parish in the Tendring District of north-east Essex, about west of Clacton-on-Sea and south-east of Colchester. It lies on the B1027, Colchester–Clacton road. The village is named after Osgyth, a 7th-century saint and princess. Locally, the name is sometimes pronounced &quot;Toosey&quot;. It is claimed to be the driest recorded place in the United Kingdom. In 2011 it had a population of 4,277.

==History==
Before being renamed after the Abbey of St Osgyth built there in the 12th century, the village was called &quot;Chich&quot; (also spelt &quot;Chiche&quot; or &quot;Chick&quot;), from an Old English word &quot;cic&quot; meaning &quot;bend&quot;, a reference to St Osyth Creek. Under King Canute/Cnut (reigned 1018–1035), Chich was assumed as part of the royal demesne and granted to Earl Godwin. By him it was given to Christ Church, Canterbury. After the Conquest it was transferred to the See of London .

The village is the location of an important mediaeval abbey, St Osyth&#x27;s Priory, named after Osgyth, a semi-legendary Saxon princess and martyr. The village was an important mediaeval pilgrimage centre, based on the cult of the saint, and was for a time very wealthy. It has an impressive parish church, St Peter and St Paul, which is a landmark building of the rediscovery of brick as a material in English architecture - its interior is almost entirely built of this material, but to a design resembling earlier stone-built churches.

Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Chiche is buried in the parish church.

For other historic buildings in St Osyth, see Historic England Archive.

St Osyth village was the subject of an episode of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Time Team&quot; programme, &quot;Lost Centuries of St Osyth&quot;, (series 12 episode 9, first broadcast in February 2005). The programme sought to uncover the early origins of the village, which is now concentrated around the Priory, the surviving parts of which date from its establishment as an Augustinian (&#x27;Austin&#x27;) monastery in the 12th century. But digging in the churchyard of St Peter and St Paul close to The Bury - the old marketplace - in the current village centre found no evidence of much settlement there before the 14th century, whereas fieldwalking and digging revealed a mass of earlier material along the north bank of St Osyth Creek, about half a mile to the south. The earlier name of the village (Chich - see above) always suggested this might be the case - information the programme failed to give. The programme found evidence that a massive high tide in the 1600s might have ended industrial activity in the original village site along the creek.

The village was a focus for the St Osyth witch persecutions in the 16th and 17th centuries. Fourteen women were tried and ten local women were hanged. In 1921 the skeletons of two women, one in chains, were discovered in the garden of a house in the village. One was claimed to be the witch Ursley Kempe, who was the first to be prosecuted. The skeletons became a local tourist attraction.
In the Napoleonic Wars two Martello Towers were built on the peninsula between the Colne Estuary and Brightlingsea Creek. One survives at Stone Point and is now the East Essex Aviation Museum. 

The peninsula was cordoned off and used by the Navy and Army in both world wars. Between 1942 and 1944 it was a landing-craft training base called HMS Helder. No 1 Martello Tower was a signal station and minefield control point, linked to the Navy at Brightlingsea.

==Geography==

St Osyth is claimed to be the driest recorded place in the United Kingdom, with an average annual rainfall of just .

The modern village lies on the coastward edge of the clay plateau which forms much of the topography of North East Essex, at an altitude of about 20 metres above mean sea level, but extends down towards the tidal St Osyth Creek. It overlooks extensive areas of rough pasture to the south and east - former marshes drained and reclaimed from the 17th century onward, which typically lie only one or two metres above mean sea level (some patches are below, especially near Jaywick). To the north-east the land was formerly heathland, and in common with much or the area around Colchester has been extensively quarried for sand and gravel.

St Osyth parish extends south from the village to the coast and includes the smaller villages of Point Clear and Lee-over-Sands.
Although much of the parish boundary is coastline, which does not need to be &quot;beaten,&quot; St Osyth is one parish that keeps up the tradition of beating the bounds on Rogation days. 
The Parish is one of the largest (in area) in Essex and extends inland almost to the village of Weeley 4 miles (6 km) to the NE.

Between the Park of the Priory and Flag Creek (of which St Osyth Creek is a tributary) lies The Howlands, an extensive area of rough pasture managed as a Nature Reserve by the Essex Wildlife Trust. This is accessible to the public via a footpath along the creek from Mill Dam, and via another from the B1027. Two birdwatching hides are accessible to the public, one overlooking the rough grassland and the other on the sea-wall with views of Flag Creek. The seawall has been deliberately breached in order to create a shallow lagoon. Avocet, Golden Plover, Shelduck, Short-eared Owl, Marsh Harrier and Brent Geese are all found there, along with the invasive Wasp Spider (Argiope bruennichi). Adders &quot;(vipera berus)&quot; are also common.

===Landmarks===

The most famous feature of the village is St Osyth&#x27;s Priory, a group of Grade I and II listed buildings. The prime ones are the late 14th-century gatehouse (see photo) decorated in flint flushwork, and the Abbot&#x27;s Tower of about 1527.

The Abbey became home to the Earls of Rochford, after King William III created the title for William Nassau de Zuylestein in 1695.

St Osyth&#x27;s Priory held a herd of polled White Park cattle until an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 1951, which led to their slaughter. A contemporary account states:
The land within the Priory boundaries is shown as a Deer Park on the Ordnance Survey map. The Priory is currently a private residence, not open to the public. Attempts by the owner to develop the park have resulted in controversy and a sustained campaign by a local group, Save Our St Osyth (S.O.S.). The owner, a property developer, has argued that the Priory buildings are in dire need of repair and development is required to finance this.

The Priory grounds contain the site of a Roman villa, marked on the Ordnance Survey map TM1216. The site of the contemporary wharf serving the villa has been identified on Howlands Marsh. A Roman road led from near Elmstead Market to the vicinity of the current St Osyth burial ground on Clay Lane.

A wooden tide mill stood at the north end of the dam which now crosses St Osyth Creek and the &#x27;Mill Pond&#x27; or Mill Dam Lake; it was demolished in 1962 but the sluice which powered the mill still operates as Mill Dam Lake is filled and emptied tidally from St Osyth Creek. The lake is used for water-skiing.

A commercial boatyard operates on St Osyth Creek. It is the home port of the Thames sailing barge Edme, formerly of the Edme Maltings at Mistley, a frequent competitor, and often victor, in the annual Thames Barge racing series.

A plaque on The Bury (as the green in front of the Priory is called) commemorates the achievement of Trevor Osben, who circumnavigated the globe in a self-built sloop.

The village church is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. The Martello tower at Point Clear has been converted into a war museum. Just south of the village lies St Clere&#x27;s Hall, a fine example of a 13th-century aisled hall (not open to the public).

===St Osyth Beach===

The neighbouring settlement of St Osyth Beach contains Essex&#x27;s largest concentration of static caravan parking, including Seawick, St Osyth Beach (owned by Park Holidays UK) and Hutleys. These boost the local population in the summer by an estimated 7,000. Some of the beach is used for nude bathing.

St Osyth Beach and adjoining Jaywick were the scene of fatalities during &quot;The Great Flood&quot; of 1953.

The tiny settlement of Lee-over-Sands, adjacent to Colne Point Nature Reserve with access from Lee Wick Lane, is a remnant of a failed 1930s attempt to build a golfing resort. Lying mostly along the seaward side of the coastal defences, it consists mainly of small chalet dwellings built on stilts to protect them against high tides. It has recently become celebrated for some unusual beach-house architecture.

==Entertainment==

The St Osyth Social Club in Church Square is home to three league darts teams: St Osyth Social, The Priorymen and SOSC Ladies.

<doc id="450871" wikidata="Q2270426" url="?curid=450871" title="John Riley (soldier)">
<text>John Patrick Riley (also known as John Patrick O&#x27;Riley; Irish: &quot;Seán Pádraig Ó Raghallaigh&quot;) ( – 10 October 1850) was an Irish soldier in the British Army who emigrated to the United States and subsequently enlisted in the United States Army. During the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848, Riley led several other defectors in the ranks who defected to Mexico, where they formed the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion in the Mexican Army.

==Early life==
Riley was born in Clifden, County Galway, Ireland around 1817–1818; his original Irish name was Seán Ó Raghailligh. He served with the British Army before emigrating to Canada. Connemara and other rural regions suffered greatly during the Great Famine, and millions of people emigrated by ship from Ireland to Canada and the United States to survive. Riley was among them.

==Immigration to the United States==
Soon after his arrival in the United States in Michigan, Riley enlisted in the US Army. Many immigrants were recruited in the 1840s; some served just to earn some money, as they had usually fled famine and severe poverty in their home countries.

Prior to his desertion, Riley served in Company K of the 5th US Infantry Regiment. Riley and Patrick Dalton deserted in 1846, just before the beginning of the Mexican-American War. Both men subsequently joined the Mexican Army, where they eventually formed the &quot;Batallón de San Patricio&quot;, or Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion. It was made up of mostly Irish and German immigrants, although it included Catholics from many other countries as well. The unit fought in several battles during the Mexican-American War. Eventually, the battalion was forced to make a last stand at the Battle of Churubusco, which took place on the outskirts of Mexico City. Approximately 35 members of the battalion were killed, while another 85 were captured by US forces, including Riley; the remnants of the unit, numbering approximately 85 men, managed to escape alongside the retreating Mexican forces. Some of the surviving soldiers took part in the Battle for Mexico City, though they were too few to constitute a cohesive military unit. The battalion itself was formally disbanded in August 1848, six months after the end of the war, allegedly due to one of the unit&#x27;s officers being implicated in an attempted military coup.

Because Riley had deserted before the US declared war against Mexico, he was not sentenced to death following his conviction at the court martial held in Mexico City in 1847. He testified to deserting because of discrimination against and mistreatment of Irish Catholics in the US Army, as well as anti-Catholicism which he had encountered in the United States. While he escaped the mass hanging of around 50 other captured members of the Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, Riley was branded on his cheek with the letter &quot;D&quot; for deserter.

==Post-court martial==

Following his conviction and branding, Riley was released and eventually rejoined the Mexican forces. Reportedly, he grew his hair to conceal the scars on his face. He continued to serve with the regular Mexican Army after the end of the war, being confirmed in the rank of &quot;Permanent Major&quot;. Stationed in Veracruz, he was retired on 14 August 1850 on medical grounds after suffering from yellow fever.

==Controversy over death==

Robert Ryal Miller, author of &quot;Shamrock and Sword&quot; (1989), found what appeared to be Riley&#x27;s death certificate in book of burials No. 6, entry 133, of the then parish (now cathedral) of Veracruz. Like Riley&#x27;s Mexican army records, it refers to the name &quot;Juan Reley&quot;. It reads:

In the H. [Heroic] city of Veracruz, on the thirty first of August of eighteen hundred and fifty, I, Don Ignacio Jose Jimenez, curate of the parish church of the Assumption of Our Lady, buried in the general cemetery the body of Juan Reley, of forty five years of age, a native of Ireland, unmarried, parents unknown; died as a result of drunkenness, without sacraments, and I signed it.

However, while Miller at the time believed this was in fact the death certificate of the San Patricio commander, both his own research and that of subsequent scholars suggest that he was mistaken. Miller died in 2004 before he could write an addendum. Some arguments which cast doubt on Miller&#x27;s original presumption include:
* The U.S. Army enlistment records from September, 1845 indicate that John Riley was born in Clifden, County Galway, and was twenty-eight years old at the time of his enlistment. That would mean he had been born between 1817 and 1818 so would have been 33 years old in 1850. The Juan Riley buried in the churchyard was 45 years old according to the curate. If this was accurate, it could not have been the leader of the San Patricios.
* Major Riley was a teetotaler and his sobriety, leadership, ambition and example was commented on by several people who knew him. Even those who condemned his desertion were aware of these qualities. A death from drunkenness would have been highly unlikely.
* Riley had been discharged on 14 August with medals for heroism, with uniforms, with a well-equipped horse and tack, with over $800 in retirement pay (the equivalent of $20,000 today). The death certificate for the indigent &quot;Juan Riley&quot; was dated 31 August, just seventeen days later.
* No robbery was mentioned in any newspaper in Veracruz during this period, nor were there any police reports of big spenders. In such a small town they would have been noticed. Thus is highly unlikely that the well-known and highly decorated major, a redhead over six feet tall and handsome except for his scars, would have been suddenly impoverished and buried (as &quot;Juan Riley&quot;) without last rites in the general cemetery just weeks after his discharge.

Research conducted in September 2012 in Clifden, County Galway failed to turn up any John Riley who would fit into the age described on the death certificate. Peter F. Stephens, author of &quot;The Rogue&#x27;s March: John Riley and the St. Patrick&#x27;s Battalion&quot;, agrees that the only Rileys which fit the profile had to be born in County Galway in 1818, a year that marks the birth of two male children to two different families each of whom were named John Riley, both of which were duly recorded by the Catholic Church records in Clifden, County Galway.

==Legacy==

In his honour, and to commemorate Saint Patrick&#x27;s Battalion, a bronze sculpture was erected in his birthplace of Clifden, Ireland, as a gift from the Mexican government.

==In popular culture==

* In the 1999 film &quot;One Man&#x27;s Hero&quot;, Riley is portrayed by Tom Berenger.
* The half-hour documentary &quot;Saol John Riley (The Life of John Riley)&quot; was broadcast on the television channel TG4 in 2011.

Mortier was born at Le Cateau (now Le Cateau-Cambrésis), northern France, on 13 February 1768. He was the son of Charles Mortier (1730–1808), a draper, and his wife Marie Anne Joseph Bonnaire (b. 1735). After studying at the Irish College, Douai, he joined the National Guard of Dunkirk in 1789, at the start of the French Revolution, and was elected captain of a unit of volunteers in September 1791.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Upon the outbreak of the War of the First Coalition in 1792, Mortier was assigned to the Army of the North. He spent the next years serving in the Low Countries theatre, fighting at the Battle of Jemappes and the Siege of Namur, in 1792, at the Battle of Neerwinden in 1793, and at the Battle of Fleurus in 1794. He was then transferred to the Army of Sambre and Meuse on the Rhine, and distinguished himself in the capture of Maastricht. Mortier was tasked by General Jacques Maurice Hatry to negotiate the surrender of the Fortress of Mainz, which he completed successfully and then returned to Paris. 

During the War of the Second Coalition in 1799, Mortier was promoted to brigade general and served under General Soult at the Second Battle of Zurich in September 1799, where he led a force of 8,000 in the attack from Dieticon on Zurich. He was made a general of division in October and recalled to Paris in early 1800.

==Napoleonic Wars==

In 1803, Mortier was appointed commander-in-chief of an invasion of the Electorate of Hanover by First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte. His successful occupation of Hanover, bringing about the Convention of Artlenburg, led Napoleon to include Mortier in the first list of marshals created in 1804. In 1805, Mortier was made commander of the infantry of the Imperial Guard.

During the War of the Third Coalition, Mortier commanded a corps of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in the Ulm campaign in which he distinguished himself. In the campaign of the middle Danube, which culminated in the Battle of Austerlitz, Napoleon placed him in command of the newly formed VIII Corps, composed of divisions from the other corps. Mortier over-extended his line of march on the north shore of the Danube and failed to heed Napoleon&#x27;s advice to protect his north flank. A combined Russo-Austrian force, under the command of General Mikhail Kutuzov enticed Mortier to send General Théodore Maxime Gazan&#x27;s 2nd Division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns. They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division, under command of General Pierre Dupont de l&#x27;Étang&#x27;s 1st Division, which covered a day&#x27;s march in a half-day. The Battle of Dürrenstein (11 November 1805) extended well into the night. Both sides claimed victory, with the French losing more than a third of the participants, and Gazan&#x27;s division experiencing over 40 percent losses. The Austrians and Russians also suffered heavy losses—close to 16 percent. After Austerlitz, Napoleon dispersed the corps and Gazan received the Legion of Honour, but Mortier was simply reassigned to command the V Corps.

When the War of the Fourth Coalition broke out in 1806, Napoleon ordered Mortier to assume command of the reformed VIII Corps on 1 October. He was to coordinate his operations with Louis Bonaparte&#x27;s Franco-Dutch troops. On 16 October, two days after his crushing victory over Prussia at Jena-Auerstedt, Napoleon ordered Mortier and Louis to conquer the Electorate of Hesse. Mortier was to occupy Fulda and then the capital city of Kassel, rule as military governor, and imprison the Elector of Hesse, William I. Every Hessian officer above the rank of lieutenant would be arrested and Napoleon stated his intention to &quot;wipe the house of Hesse-Kassel from the map&quot;. Mortier knew this constituted a violation of Hessian neutrality and boasted on 17 October that its very neutrality made it easy to conquer. On 1 November, the French occupied and looted Kassel, discovering that William had fled. Mortier issued a proclamation in which he claimed to have come to avenge Prussian violation of Hessian neutrality but also accused them of being Prussian allies.
Mortier left a division to hold Hesse-Kassel while the rest of his corps was directed to mopping-up operations in Prussia. Hamelin capitulated on 22 November, along with a garrison of 10,000 Prussian troops. Nienburg fell on 29 November, with 2,911 Prussian soldiers marching into captivity. In 1807, he led the left wing of Napoleon&#x27;s army at Battle of Friedland, and served at the sieges of Stralsund and Kolberg. In 1808, Napoleon rewarded Mortier for his actions at Friedland with the title of &quot;Duke of Treviso&quot; (&quot;Duc de Trévise&quot; in French), a &quot;duché grand-fief&quot; (a rare, but nominal, hereditary honor, extinguished in 1946) in his own Kingdom of Italy.

In October 1808, Mortier was sent to Spain in the campaign for the recapture of Madrid, at the head of the V Corps, which he led at the Battle of Somosierra and the Second Siege of Zaragoza. He then fought under Marshal Soult at the Arzobispo, in August 1809, and contributed to the victory at Ocaña, where he was wounded. Afterwards Mortier served in southern Spain, most notably at the Siege of Badajoz, before being recalled to France in May 1811.

During the invasion of Russia in 1812, Mortier commanded the Young Guard. After the Battle of Borodino he became governor of French-occupied Moscow, and was ordered to destroy what remained of the city when the retreat began. He then fought at Krasnoi, at the Berezina, and regrouped the surviving Imperial Guards in January 1813. Mortier again commanded the Young Guard in several battles of the German campaign, including Lützen, Bautzen, Dresden and Leipzig. During the defense of France in 1814, he rendered brilliant services in command of rearguards and covering detachments, and led the Old Guard at Montmirail, Craonne, Laon, and at the final Battle of Paris.

He rallied to the Bourbon Restoration after Napoleon&#x27;s abdication in April 1814. In 1815, during Napoleon&#x27;s return to power in the Hundred Days, Mortier escorted the king out of the country before joining the emperor in Paris. He was given command of the Imperial Guard once more, but at the opening of the Waterloo campaign, he was unable to continue due to severe sciatica.

==Post-war career==
Following the second Bourbon Restoration, Mortier relutanctly accepted to be part of the court martial trying Marshal Michel Ney. After the court declared itself incompetent he was for a time in disgrace, but in January 1816 he received a command, and in 1819 Mortier was readmitted to the Chamber of Peers and in 1825 received the Order of the Holy Spirit, the kingdom&#x27;s highest honor. He supported the July Revolution that brought King Louis Philippe to power in 1830. From 1830 to 1831 he was the Ambassador of France to Russia at St. Petersburg, and from 1834 to 1834, Minister of War and President of the Council of Ministers.

===Death===

On 28 July 1835, Mortier was one of those accompanying King Louis-Philippe to a review of the Paris National Guard, an annual event that commemorated the July Revolution that brought the king to power in 1830. In the &quot;Boulevard du Temple&quot;, the royal party was hit by a volley of gunfire from the upstairs window of a house. Eighteen were killed, including Mortier, and 22 injured. The king received only a minor wound.

The weapon used was a home-made volley gun, constructed and fired by Giuseppe Marco Fieschi for the purpose of assassinating the king. Fieschi had fixed twenty-five musket barrels to a wooden frame, and arranged that they could be fired simultaneously. Four of the barrels burst when fired and Fieschi was badly wounded. He was quickly captured and later tried with two co-conspirators. The three went to the guillotine in February 1836.

==Family==
Mortier married Eve Anne Hymmès (Coblence, 19 August 1779Paris, 13 February 1855), by whom he had six children:
*Caroline Mortier de Trevise (1800–1842): married to Marie-Hippolyte de Gueulluy, 2nd Marquess of Rumigny.

<doc id="450876" wikidata="Q1846056" url="?curid=450876" title="Lord Chancellor of Ireland">
<text>The Lord High Chancellor of Ireland (commonly known as Lord Chancellor of Ireland) was the highest judicial office in Ireland until the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. From 1721 to the end of 1800, it was also the highest political office of the Irish Parliament: the Chancellor was Speaker of the Irish House of Lords. The Lord Chancellor was also Lord Keeper of the [[Great Seal of Ireland]]. In all three respects, the office mirrored the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

==Origins==
There is a good deal of confusion as to precisely when the office originated. Until the reign of Henry III of England, it is doubtful if the offices of Irish and English Chancellor were distinct. Only in 1232 is there a clear reference to a separate Court of Chancery (Ireland). Early Irish Lord Chancellors, beginning with Stephen Ridell in 1186, were simply the English Chancellor acting through a Deputy. In about 1244 the decision was taken that there must be separate holders of the office in England and Ireland. Elrington Ball states that the salary was fixed at sixty marks a year, equivalent to forty pounds sterling. Although it was twice what an itinerant justice was paid at the time, it was apparently not considered to be a very generous amount: Richard Northalis, Lord Chancellor 1393–97, complained that it did not cover even a third of his expenses, and asked for an extra payment of twenty pounds a year. In his case, it is thought that the hostility of his colleagues in government was responsible for the poor salary.

In the earlier centuries, the Lord Chancellor was always a cleric, and usually an Englishman. Lay Chancellors became common after the Reformation, and no cleric was appointed Chancellor after 1665, but although there were a number of exceptions, the Crown retained a preference for English-born Chancellors until the mid-nineteenth century.

==Lord Chancellors of Ireland, 1186–1922==

===12th century===
* Stephen Ridell. Appointed in 1186. (first Chancellor). Came to Ireland in the entourage of the future King John, and was then referred to as &quot;his Chancellor&quot;.

<text>In the Quechuan languages of South America, a huaca or wak&#x27;a is an object that represents something revered, typically a monument of some kind. The term &quot;huaca&quot; can refer to natural locations, such as immense rocks. Some huacas have been associated with veneration and ritual. The Quechua people traditionally believed every object has a physical presence and two &quot;camaquen&quot; (spirits), one to create it and another to animate it. They would invoke its spirits for the object to function.

==&quot;Huacas&quot; in Peru==
Huacas are commonly located in nearly all regions of Peru outside the deepest parts of the Amazon basin in correlation with the regions populated by the pre-Inka and Inka early civilizations. They can be found in downtown Lima today in almost every district, the city having been built around them. Huacas within the municipal district of Lima are typically fenced off to avoid graffiti.

==&quot;Huacas&quot; along ceremonial routes==
A huaca could be built along a processional ceremonial line or route, as was done for the enactment of sacred ritual within the capital at Cusco. Such lines were referred to as ceques. The work of Tom Zuidema and Brian Bauer (UT-Austin) explores the range of debate over their usage and significance.

These lines were laid out to express the cosmology of the culture and were sometimes aligned astronomically to various stellar risings and settings. These pertained to seasonal ceremonies and time keeping (for the purposes of agriculture and ceremony and record keeping). These ceque lines bear significant resemblance to the processional lines among the Maya (sacbe), the Chacoans, and the Muisca (Suna).

===&quot;Huacas&quot; in the Inka Empire===
In the Inca (Inka) Empire, huacas were involved more in prominent monuments, such as the Huaca del Sol and the Huaca de la Luna. As stated above, they were also found along the ceque system (or siq&#x27;is lines). When talking about huacas in the Inka empire, it&#x27;s important to understand that both the Andean people of the Andes region and the Inka shared many beliefs when it came to huaca ideology. Pre-empire Inka had a hard time gaining land control in their constant fights with the Andeans, and only peace was made when the Inka materialized their huacas into a state-controlled system that was common throughout the empire. A common system and a common cultural influence held the Inka empire together:

&quot;&quot;It can be argued that the sacred nature of huacas represented the primary connection between Andean ideologies and Inca ideology. Both Andean and Inca ideologies considered huacas as manifestations of both the natural and the supernatural world such as springs, stones, hills and mountains, temples, caves, roads, or trees (D‟Altroy 2002:163).&quot; 

The Inka believed in using the huacas as the main agents of sacred and supernatural structural affiliation in their culture, while also using them as political and social tools for manipulation of other cultural groups around them. In the Cusco ceque system, most, if not all, of the huacas facilitated communication with the supernatural world or had some connection with chthonic powers that were thought to have shaped certain aspects of the region&#x27;s people. While the Inka huacas were mainly stationary, some of the Andean huacas were actually portable. There are references to huacas being taken into battle or being physically transported to Cusco, capital of the Inka empire. One such huaca is described below:

&quot;The ninth guaca (huaca) was named Cugiguaman. It was a stone shaped like a falcon which Inca Yupanqui said had appeared to him in a quarry, and he ordered that it be placed on this ceque and that sacrifices be made to it.&quot;&quot;

Some huacas were described as shrines, monuments, or temples that were associated with religion. Other huacas were physical aspects of the landscape, such as mountains or large boulders that still held religious and cultural significance. Since the huacas could have been a part of the landscape, this made it difficult for archaeologists to find and identify them. Shrines and shrine candidates were promptly photographed and compared to other known huacas. Interviews with local village officials helped researchers ensure that the huacas found on the ceques were legitimate. The location of the huacas aided archaeologists in determining what they were used for and what religious ceremonies may have occurred there.

Special compounds were erected at certain huacas where priests composed elaborate rituals and religious ceremonial culture. For instance, the ceremony of the sun was performed at Cusco (Inti Raymi). The Inka elaborated creatively on a preexisting system of religious veneration of the peoples whom they took into their empire. This exchange ensured proper compliance among conquered peoples. The Inka also transplanted and colonized whole groups of persons of Inka background (Mitmaq) with newly adopted peoples to arrange a better distribution of Inka persons throughout all of their empire in order to avoid widespread resistance. In this instance, huacas and &quot;pacarinas&quot; became significant centers of shared worship and a point of unification of ethnically and linguistically diverse peoples. They helped to bring unity and common citizenship to often geographically disparate peoples. Since pre-inka times the people developed a system of pilgrimages to these various shrines, prior to the introduction of Catholicism.

==Moche &quot;Huacas&quot;==
Two of the greatest huacas built by the Moche were the Huaca del Sol and the Huaca de la Luna. While both of these buildings were built with mud adobe bricks, many characteristics of the bricks differ between the two huacas. Thus, symbolizing two distinct eras in Inka architecture. The bricks varied in many ways such as dimensions, maker marks, soil composition, and mold marks. With that being said, both buildings were constructed in similar ways. Adobe bricks were laid into vertical columns adjacent to one another. Continuing to lay adobe brick columns next to one another in order to construct different sections of a building is characterized as “segmented” construction. The construction of Huaca del Sol is determined to have used over 143 million adobe bricks and the platforms from the Luna are estimated to have required over 50 million adobe blocks. The only uniform characteristic of these adobe bricks, in regard to their dimensional shape, is that &quot;they are wider than they are high.&quot; Bricks in the same segment were relatively similar in shape and size, however, there was little symmetry between segments. Many sections of Luna show greater deviation than later columns and structures. As the Inka empire grew in strength and size, adobe bricks became increasingly ubiquitous. Many segments of Luna saw an abundance of deviation from one another. Conversely, Sol, which was built after Luna, has a more well-defined uniformity between adobe bricks used between segments. While the uniform shape of the bricks helped to signify the increasing dominance of the Inka, adobe bricks remained unique in one way. Each brick was marked by its maker on the bottom of the brick. While some markers appear more frequently than others, each symbolizes where the adobe bricks came from.

<doc id="450881" wikidata="Q1345609" url="?curid=450881" title="Giuseppe Marco Fieschi">
<text>Giuseppe Marco Fieschi (13 December 1790 – 19 February 1836) was a Corsican mass murderer, and the chief conspirator in an attempted assassination of King Louis-Philippe of France on 28 July 1835. The attack on the King and his entourage, which made use of a unique volley gun known as the &quot;infernal machine,&quot; killed 18 people, but the King only received a minor wound and Fieschi was quickly captured. He and two other conspirators were subsequently tried and executed.

== Biography ==
Fieschi was born on 13 December 1790 in Bocognano, a commune on the island of Corsica. His parents were Louis and Marie Lucie, of Pomonti. He had two brothers, Thomas and Anthony. Thomas was killed in the Battle of Wagram. Anthony was mute from birth. Giuseppe spent his childhood and adolescence as a shepherd. In 1808 he joined a Corsican regiment and was sent to Naples, then to Russia to fight in the Napoleonic Wars. In 1812 he held the rank of sergeant. He was discharged from the army in 1814 and returned to Corsica. In September 1815, he was one of around 1000 followers who joined former King of Naples Joachim Murat in an attempt to regain his kingdom, this ended a month later with Murat&#x27;s capture and execution by forces of Ferdinand IV of Naples. According to Harsin, Fieschi escaped execution and was deported to France, where he was eventually sentenced in 1816 to 10 years in jail for the theft of a steer. There he met a female inmate, Laurence Petit. Upon his release in 1826 he moved to Lyon, Petit&#x27;s hometown.

Shortly after the July Revolution, Fieschi moved to Paris, calling himself a political prisoner, a deceit that allowed for unchallenged movement. There, he maintained a lifelong affair with his stepdaughter Nina, which led to the break-up of his relationship with her mother, Laurence. He obtained a small post in Paris by means of forged papers, but eventually lost his job and pensions that he had fraudulently obtained from the government.

=== Attempted assassination of Louis Philippe I ===
In 1831, Fieschi met his later-to-be co-conspirator Pierre Morey, a neighbour. Morey was a 61-year-old saddler who had been involved in Republican politics. He had been arrested but released in 1816 after falling under suspicion of plotting the assassination of the Bourbons. He was later tried and acquitted of the murder of an Austrian soldier. In 1830, he took part in the July Revolution that put King Louis-Phillipe in power.

The two contrived the plan for an &quot;infernal machine&quot;, a volley gun with 25 gun-barrels which could be fired simultaneously. Morey took the plan to Theodore Pepin, chief of the Society of the Rights of Man &quot;Section Rome&quot;. After a meeting, they decided to build the weapon, splitting the cost of 500 francs between Pepin and Morey, with the penniless Fieschi building it and being paid for it. The gun was built in the place it was intended to be used – a four-room apartment on the third floor of No. 50 Boulevard du Temple. This was on the expected route the King and his entourage would take during the annual review of the Paris National Guard.

The annual review, which commemorated the 1830 July revolution, took place on 28 July 1835. Louis-Philippe was passing along the Boulevard du Temple, which connected Place de la République to the Bastille. He was accompanied by three of his sons, the Duke of Orleans, the Duke of Nemours, and the Prince de Joinville, and a large number of staff and senior officers.

Fieschi was waiting for them, 24 barrels of his gun were each loaded with eight round balls and additional slugs. When the royal party passed in the street below, he fired the gun. Not all the barrels fired, but the gun still produced a volley of around 400 projectiles. Eighteen people were killed at the scene, or later died from their wounds, including Lieutenant Colonel Rieussec together with eight other officers of the 8th Legion, Marshal Mortier, and Colonel Raffet, General Girard, Captain Villate, General La Chasse de Vérigny and , father of notable architect Henri Labrouste.

A further 22 people were injured, with at least four requiring limbs to be amputated. The King was one of the injured, but the wound was minor – a bullet or buckshot only grazed his forehead, although the horse he was riding was severely wounded, and died several days later. The King continued with the day&#x27;s events and reviewed the National Guard as planned. Many of the dead and injured were carried into the Jardin Turc, a famous cafe that was situated nearby.

Four of the gun&#x27;s 25 barrels burst when fired, four others did not fire, and a further one was not loaded as it lacked a touch hole. This meant the number of deaths and injuries was lower than might have been the case had all components functioned. The gun barrels that exploded caused considerable damage to the room in which the weapon was fired. Fieschi received severe head, facial and hand wounds and he was quickly captured. Two of his fingers later had to be amputated.

=== Trial and execution ===
After his capture, Fieschi gave a false name, claiming to be Jacques Girard, born in Lodève. It was only after some days that his true identity was discovered when he was recognized by the Inspector General of Prisons, Olivier Dufresne, while he was being held in the Conciergerie.

Fieschi&#x27;s trial became a great spectacle and Fieschi enjoyed his stardom. During the trial, he named his accomplices, displayed much bravado, and expected or pretended to expect ultimate pardon. He was represented by the Corsican lawyer François-Marie Patorni, and Parisian lawyers Gustave Louis Chaix d&#x27;Est-Ange and . He was condemned to death, and was guillotined on 19 February 1836 together with Pierre Morey and Theodore Pépin. Pepin died first, then Morey. Fieschi was the last, and used his last moments for a speech. Fieschi&#x27;s head was given to a doctor at Bicêtre Hospital for study purposes.

Before his death, Pepin made several confessions about revolutionary groups which led to subsequent arrests and trials. Another accomplice was sentenced to twenty years imprisonment and one was acquitted. No fewer than seven plots against the life of Louis Philippe had been discovered by the police within the year, and apologists were not wanting in the revolutionary press for the crime of Fieschi.

== Legacy ==
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, a number of newspaper editors and writers were arrested, including Armand Carrel, but they were soon released. Fourteen victims of Fieschi&#x27;s attack were interred in the vaults of Les Invalides, which is usually the place of interment for French military leaders which the nation wishes to honor.

Horace Vernet, the King&#x27;s painter, was ordered to make a drawing of the assassination attempt, which Eugene Louis Lami executed. Fieschi&#x27;s head was painted by the French painter Jacques Raymond Brascassat the day after the execution. A death mask was also made to record Fieschi&#x27;s facial features. A copy of this is preserved in England at Norwich Castle; the mask shows evidence of the facial and head injuries he received. Another copy was part of the collection of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society and is now in the possession of the University of Edinburgh.
A postmortem examination of Fieschi&#x27;s brain was carried out by the anatomists Louis Pierre Gratiolet and François Leuret, to determine if it exhibited features that might explain his behavior.

A plaque at n° 50 Boulevard du Temple commemorates the event. Giuseppe Fieschi was honored in a religious service at a Moscow church at the prompting of Soviet General , the inventor of the Katyusha rocket launcher.

Fieschi&#x27;s volley gun, which became known as the &quot;Machine infernale&quot;, is now part of the collection of the Musée des Archives Nationales in Paris.

<text>The Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978 was a catastrophic, historic nor&#x27;easter that struck New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the New York metropolitan area. The Blizzard of &#x27;78 formed on Sunday, February 5, 1978 and broke up on February 7. The storm was initially known as &quot;Storm Larry&quot; in Connecticut, following the local convention promoted by the Travelers Weather Service on television and radio stations there. Snow fell mostly from Monday morning, February 6 to the evening of Tuesday, February 7. Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts were hit especially hard by this storm.

Boston received a record-breaking of snow; Providence also broke a record with ; Atlantic City broke an all-time storm accumulation with ; two Philadelphia suburban towns in Chester County received , while the City of Philadelphia received . Nearly all economic activity was disrupted in the worst-hit areas. The storm killed about 100 people in the Northeast and injured about 4,500. It caused more than (US$ in terms) in damage.

==Meteorological history==

The storm was formed from an extratropical cyclone off the coast of South Carolina on February 5. An Arctic cold front and a cold air mass then merged with the storm, creating the perfect ingredients for a large and intense low-pressure system.

This storm system made its way up the coast and approached southern New England late February 6 and early February 7. Since it developed during a new moon, an unusually large high tide occurred, and the storm brought a massive amount of water along coastal communities. The huge storm surge resulted in broken sea walls and massive property loss.

Strong winds and extremely heavy precipitation brought zero visibility for travelers, and numerous power outages ensued. The precipitation changed to rain on Cape Cod, reducing the total snowfall, but snow continued in the west. By the time it ended, thousands of people were stranded and homeless as a result of the storm.

===Storm strength===
The storm&#x27;s power was made apparent by its sustained hurricane-force winds of approximately with gusts to and the formation of an eye-like structure in the middle. While a typical nor&#x27;easter brings steady snow for six to twelve hours, the Blizzard of &#x27;78 brought heavy snow for an unprecedented full 33 hours as it was blocked from heading into the North Atlantic by a strong Canadian high pressure area. In many areas in Central and Southern New England, the snow falling at night turned to an icy mix that left a notable layer of solid ice on every external surface. This icy mixture greatly complicated recovery efforts in subsequent days, as it added considerable weight to power lines and tree limbs. Many trees that survived the daytime snow event did not survive the nighttime conditions.

An atypical vertical development of storm clouds brought unusual thundersnow to southern New England and Long Island. These storms resulted in lightning and thunder accompanying the snowfall as it fell at an hour at times.

==Effects==

===Conditions===
One of the major problems with the Blizzard of 1978 was the lack of foreknowledge about the storm&#x27;s severity. Weather forecasting in New England is difficult, and meteorologists had developed a reputation as being inaccurate. Forecasting techniques and technology had improved dramatically in the 1970s, but the public was still quite skeptical. Snow failed to arrive in Monday&#x27;s pre-dawn hours as predicted, and many locals felt it to be another failed forecast—despite the accuracy of National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters&#x27; predictions concerning the Great Blizzard—and they went to work and school as normal. Because of this, people had neither time nor incentive to prepare. The region was already reeling after storms in January 1978 that left nearly two feet of snow in some areas of New England, and had caused the collapse of the roof of the Hartford Civic Center.

The government of Massachusetts had a system for notifying major employers to send employees home early in the event of heavy storms. Thousands of employees were sent home starting in the early afternoon of February 6, but thousands more were still caught by the storm. Some did not make it home for several days. Many people were stranded in their cars along roads throughout New England. Fourteen people died on I-95 near Boston because snow piled high enough to prevent poisonous exhaust fumes from escaping from their idling vehicles. I-95 eventually had to be evacuated by cross-country skiers and snowmobilers. More than 3,500 cars were found abandoned and buried on roads during the cleanup. This number excludes the countless other vehicles buried in driveways, on the sides of streets, and in parking lots. Other transportation links were disrupted and shut down throughout the region, stranding public-transit commuters in city centers.

Snowplows were also stranded in traffic as the snow continued to fall. At one point on I-93 north of Boston, a jackknifed tractor trailer blocked traffic in both directions, with a similar event occurring on Route 128 near Route 138 in Canton. The Neponset River also flooded I-93 in Milton, causing the highway&#x27;s complete closure.

A massive effort was made to clear Logan Airport runways for 200 National Guard troops&#x27; arrival on 27 C-130 and C-141 military flights from Fort Bragg and Fort Devens, who were called out by the governor.

Some 11,666 college-hockey fans in Boston Garden, then the site of the 26th edition of the annual &quot;Beanpot&quot; college ice hockey tournament, held at the time of the blizzard&#x27;s outbreak, found weather much different from what they had expected. Some spectators spent the next few days living at the arena, eating hot dogs, and sleeping in the bleachers and locker rooms. Because of the blizzard, the second round of the Beanpot that year was not held until March 1, 1978, the latest date ever for the tournament&#x27;s concluding games.

Throughout eastern Massachusetts, automobile traffic was banned for the remainder of the week. Thousands of people walked and skied on the quiet city streets and over the frozen Charles River.

This blizzard was one of the worst in Rhode Island&#x27;s history, catching off guard many residents and the state government. Although Governor J. Joseph Garrahy had ordered an emergency evacuation of all public buildings, shortly before noon on February 6, too many people had lagged. Providence County, Rhode Island, was the hardest hit by the blizzard; the towns of Lincoln, Smithfield, Woonsocket, and North Smithfield all reported totals of at least snow.

In New York City, it was one of the rare times that a snowstorm closed the schools; the New York City Board of Education closed schools for snow again only once in the next 18 years, on April 7, 1982. Most suburban districts in the area close for snow several times each winter, but they rarely do in the city itself because of relatively easy access to subways, whose ability to run is not appreciably affected by moderate snowstorms. The New York Knicks were forced to postpone a basketball game for the first time ever, due to the airports being closed and the Portland Trail Blazers being unable to arrive in time.

Many people were caught in the storm while driving, and many others were trapped in their homes and workplaces, with snow drifts of up to , in some places blocking the exits. In many cases, those who had become ill or had been injured during the storm had to be taken to hospitals by snowmobile. Other people left their homes and went for help by cross-country skis and sleds.

The storm caused coastal flooding. The fierce northeast winds from the storm—with the low-pressure area stalled off the island of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard—combined with high tides and storm surge, resulting from the storm&#x27;s low pressure. This sent water over low land along the shores of Long Island Sound, Cape Cod Bay, and other bodies of water, causing some of the worst recorded coastal flooding. The flood continued through two days of tide cycles, a total of four successive high tides. Thousands of homes throughout coastal Massachusetts were damaged or destroyed, as was &quot;Motif Number 1&quot;, in Rockport, an often-painted fisherman&#x27;s shack renowned in art circles. (A replica was constructed later the same year.) The &quot;Peter Stuyvesant&quot;, a former Hudson River Day Line boat turned into a floating restaurant, was sunk in Boston Harbor. The region&#x27;s fishing fleet was damaged by the storm.

===Winds===

The storm&#x27;s straight-line surface winds destroyed buildings along the coast, often aided by flooding and waves. Wind gusts of were recorded in Plum Island and at First Cliff in Scituate, Massachusetts. Duxbury Beach was hit with gusts and in Chatham.

===Aftermath and recovery===
Boston and Providence recorded all-time highs for 24-hour and storm snowfall. Many people were left without heat, water, food, and electricity for over a week after the storm finished. Approximately 10,000 people moved into emergency shelters. Some 2,500 houses were reported as seriously damaged or destroyed and 54 people were killed, many because of fallen electrical wires. Several people were found dead in downtown Providence, near the central police station; they may have been seeking shelter. Ten-year-old Peter Gosselin, of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, disappeared in the deep snow just feet from his home&#x27;s front door and was not found until three weeks later. Most of the Interstate highway system in the region was shut down, with some stretches not reopening to traffic until the following week. Air and rail traffic also were shut down.

The snow fell too quickly for plow trucks to keep up. Plows were further hampered by the number of cars stuck on the roads. In Boston, the deep snow overwhelmed the city&#x27;s sanitation department, because there was no more room along streets and sidewalks to put the snow; much of it was hauled to nearby harbors and dumped. Throughout the region, the high winds caused enormous drifts.

A state of emergency was declared by governors in the affected states, and the United States National Guard was called out to help clear the roads. Additional troops were flown into Boston to help. It took six days to clear the roads of snow and of the cars and trucks buried in it. Governor Ella T. Grasso ordered all roads in Connecticut closed except for emergency travel, for three days; Governor Michael Dukakis, of Massachusetts, did the same for his state. The parking lot of Fenway Park was used for the National Guard to stage its efforts. In Massachusetts, there was no travel ban again until 35 years later, when Governor Deval Patrick announced a travel ban on February 8, 2013, running from 4 p.m. that day until 4 p.m. the next day, because of the February 2013 nor&#x27;easter, whose snowfall rivaled and, in some places, beat that of the Blizzard of &#x27;78; in the &quot;Blizzard of &#x27;13&quot;, the ban was declared before the worst hit; in the Blizzard of &#x27;78 this happened after the storm&#x27;s worst.

Extensive beach erosion occurred on the east coast of Massachusetts. Especially hard-hit were Cape Cod and Cape Ann, both on the eastern shore of Massachusetts. In Truro, on Cape Cod, the Atlantic Ocean broke through to the Pamet River for the first time during this storm, completely washing away the link between the North and South Pamet roads. The town chose not to reconstruct the link, though the right-of-way is open to pedestrians. Monomoy Island was split into north and south parts.

Many homes along the New England and Long Island coastlines were destroyed or washed into the ocean. Many roofs collapsed across New England from snow load.

<text>George Wild Galvin (20 December 1860 – 31 October 1904), better known by the stage name Dan Leno, was a leading English music hall comedian and musical theatre actor during the late Victorian era. He was best known, aside from his music hall act, for his dame roles in the annual pantomimes that were popular at London&#x27;s Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, from 1888 to 1904.

Leno was born in St Pancras, London, and began to entertain as a child. In 1864, he joined his parents on stage in their music hall act, and he made his first solo appearance, aged nine, at the Britannia Music Hall in Coventry. As a youth, he was famous for his clog dancing, and in his teen years, he became the star of his family&#x27;s act. He adopted the stage name Dan Leno and, in 1884, made his first performance under that name in London. As a solo artist, he became increasingly popular during the late 1880s and 1890s, when he was one of the highest-paid comedians in the world. He developed a music hall act of talking about life&#x27;s mundane subjects, mixed with comic songs and surreal observations, and created a host of mostly working-class characters to illustrate his stories. In 1901, still at the peak of his career, he performed his &quot;Huntsman&quot; sketch for Edward VII at Sandringham. The monarch was so impressed that Leno became publicly known as &quot;the king&#x27;s jester&quot;.

Leno also appeared in burlesque and, every year from 1888 to 1904, in the Drury Lane Theatre&#x27;s Christmas pantomime spectacles. He was generous and active in charitable causes, especially to benefit performers in need. Leno continued to appear in musical comedies and his own music hall routines until 1902, although he suffered increasingly from alcoholism. This, together with his long association with dame and low comedy roles, prevented him from being taken seriously as a dramatic actor, and he was turned down for Shakespearean roles. Leno began to behave in an erratic and furious manner by 1902, and he suffered a mental breakdown in early 1903. He was committed to a mental asylum, but was discharged later that year. After one more show, his health declined, and he died aged 43.

==Biography==

===Family background and early life===
Leno was born in St Pancras, London. He was the youngest of six children, including two elder brothers, John and Henry, and an elder sister, Frances. Two other siblings died in infancy. His parents, John Galvin (1826–1864) and his wife Louisa (&quot;née&quot; Dutton; 1831–1891), performed together in a music hall double act called &quot;The Singing and Acting Duettists&quot;. Known professionally as Mr. and Mrs. Johnny Wild, they did not achieve much success, and the family struggled in poverty.

Having had very little schooling, and being raised by performers, Leno learned to entertain as a child. In 1862, Leno&#x27;s parents and elder brothers appeared at the Surrey Music Hall in Sheffield, then performed in Manchester, Glasgow and Northampton later in the year. In 1864, at the age of four, Leno joined his parents on stage for the first time, at the Cosmotheca Music Hall in Paddington, under the billing &quot;Little George, the Infant Wonder, Contortionist, and Posturer&quot;.

When Leno was four years old, his alcoholic father died, aged 37; the family then moved to Liverpool, where his mother married William Grant (1837–1896), on 7 March 1866. Grant was a comedian of Lancastrian and Irish descent, who performed in music halls throughout the British provinces under the stage name of William Leno. He was a seasoned actor and had been employed by Charles Kean in his theatre company at the Princess&#x27;s Theatre in London. In 1866, the family home in Marylebone was demolished to make way for St Pancras railway station, and as a result Leno&#x27;s sister Frances was sent to live with an uncle, while his brother John, who had occasionally performed with his parents, took full-time employment. Leno, his mother, stepfather and brother Henry moved north and settled in Liverpool, where they performed in various halls and theatres, including the Star Music Hall, but they often returned to London to perform in the capital&#x27;s music halls.

===Early career===

In 1865, Leno and his brother Henry, who first taught Leno to dance, formed a clog dancing double act known as &quot;The Great Little Lenos&quot;. This was the first time that Leno used his stepfather&#x27;s stage name, &quot;Leno&quot;, which he never registered legally. The same year, Leno also appeared in his first pantomime, in Liverpool, where he had a supporting part as a juvenile clown in &quot;Fortunatus; or, The Magic Wishing Cap&quot; alongside his parents, who appeared as &quot;Mr and Mrs Leno – Comic Duettists&quot;. On 18 July 1866, Leno, Henry and their parents appeared on the opening night of the Cambridge Music Hall in Toxteth, Liverpool, under the billing &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Leno, the Great, Sensational, Dramatic and Comic Duettists and The Brothers Leno, Lancashire Clog, Boot and Pump Dancers&quot;. The following year, the brothers made their first appearance without their parents at the Britannia music hall in Hoxton. Although initially successful, the pair experienced many bouts of unemployment and often busked outside London pubs to make a living. Tired of surviving on little or no money, Henry left the clog dancing act to take up a trade in London, forcing Leno to consider a future as a solo performer. Henry later founded a dance school. Henry was replaced intermittently in the act by the boys&#x27; uncle, Johnny Danvers, who was a week older than Leno. Leno and Danvers had been close from an early age.

Leno made his debut as a solo performer in 1869, returning to the Britannia music hall in Hoxton, where he became known as &quot;The Great Little Leno, the Quintessence of Irish Comedians&quot;. The name was suggested by his stepfather, William, who thought the Irish connection would appeal to audiences on their upcoming visit to Dublin. Arriving in Ireland the same year, the Lenos were struggling financially and stayed with William&#x27;s relatives. In addition to his performances as part of the family act, young Leno appeared as a solo act under an Irish-sounding stage name, &quot;Dan Patrick&quot;. This allowed him to earn a separate fee of 23 shillings per performance plus living expenses. The name &quot;Dan&quot; may have been chosen to honour Dan Lowery, a northern music hall comedian and music hall proprietor whom the Lenos had met a few months earlier. During this tour of Ireland, the Lenos appeared in Dublin in a pantomime written by Leno&#x27;s father: &quot;Old King Humpty; or, Harlequin Emerald Isle and Katty of Killarney&quot; (1869), for which Leno was praised by Charles Dickens, who was in the audience and told him: &quot;Good little man, you&#x27;ll make headway!&quot;

In 1870, the Lenos appeared in another pantomime by Leno&#x27;s father, &quot;Jack the Giant Killer; or, Harlequin Grim Gosling, or the Good Fairy Queen of the Golden Pine Grove&quot;, in which Leno played the title character and featured in the variety entertainment that preceded the pantomime. Throughout the 1870s, Leno and his parents performed as &quot;The Comic Trio (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Leno and Dan Patrick) In Their Really Funny Entertainments, Songs and Dances&quot;. In the family act with his parents and Johnny Danvers, young Leno often took the leading role in such sketches as his stepfather&#x27;s &quot;The Wicklow Wedding&quot;. Another of their sketches was &quot;Torpedo Bill&quot;, in which Leno played the title role, an inventor of explosive devices. His parents played a &quot;washerwoman&quot; and a &quot;comic cobbler&quot;. This was followed by another sketch, &quot;Pongo the Monkey&quot;. Opening at Pullan&#x27;s Theatre of Varieties in Bradford on 20 May 1878, this burlesque featured Leno as an escaped monkey; it became his favourite sketch of the period.

The teenage Leno&#x27;s growing popularity led to bookings at, among others, the Varieties Theatre in Sheffield and the Star Music Hall in Manchester. At the same time, Leno&#x27;s clog dancing continued to be so good that in 1880 he won the world championship at the Princess&#x27;s Music Hall in Leeds, for which he received a gold and silver belt weighing 44.5 oz (1.26 kg). His biographer, the pantomime librettist J. Hickory Wood, described his act: &quot;He danced on the stage; he danced on a pedestal; he danced on a slab of slate; he was encored over and over again; but throughout his performance, he never uttered a word&quot;.

===1880s===

In 1878, Leno and his family moved to Manchester. There he met Lydia Reynolds, who, in 1883, joined the Leno family theatre company, which already consisted of his parents, Danvers and Leno. The following year, Leno and Reynolds married; around this time, he adopted the stage name &quot;Dan Leno&quot;. On 10 March 1884, the Leno family took over the running of the Grand Varieties Theatre in Sheffield. The Lenos felt comfortable with their working-class Sheffield audiences. On their opening night, over 4,000 patrons entered the theatre, paying sixpence to see Dan Leno star in &quot;Doctor Cut &#x27;Em Up&quot;. In October 1884, facing tough competition, the Lenos gave up the lease on the theatre.

In 1885, Leno and his wife moved to Clapham Park, London, and Leno gained new success with a solo act that featured comedy patter, dancing and song. On the night of his London debut, he appeared in three music halls: the Foresters&#x27; Music Hall in Mile End, Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane and Gatti&#x27;s-in-the-Road, where he earned £5 a week in total (£ in 2025 adjusted for inflation). Although billed as &quot;The Great Irish Comic Vocalist and Clog Champion&quot; at first, he slowly phased out his dancing in favour of character studies, such as &quot;Going to Buy Milk for the Twins&quot;, &quot;When Rafferty Raffled his Watch&quot; and &quot;The Railway Guard&quot;. His dancing had earned him popularity in the provinces, but Leno found that his London audiences preferred these sketches and his comic songs. Leno&#x27;s other London venues in the late 1880s included Collins&#x27;s Music Hall in Islington, the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in Poplar and the Standard in Pimlico.

Leno was a replacement in the role of Leontes in the 1888 musical burlesque of the ancient Greek character &quot;Atalanta&quot; at the Strand Theatre, directed by Charles Hawtrey. It was written by Hawtrey&#x27;s brother, George P. Hawtrey, and it starred Frank Wyatt, Willie Warde and William Hawtrey. The &quot;Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot; praised Leno&#x27;s singing and dancing and reported that: &quot;He brings a good deal of fun and quaintness to the not very important part of Leontes.&quot; Leno accepted the role at short notice, with no opportunity to learn the script. But his improvised comedy helped to extend the life of the show. When Leno and another leading actor left a few months later, the production closed.

===Music hall===

During the 1890s, Leno was the leading performer on the music hall stage, rivalled only by Albert Chevalier, who moved into music hall from the legitimate theatre. Their styles and appeal were very different: Leno&#x27;s characters were gritty working-class realists, while Chevalier&#x27;s were overflowing in romanticism, and his act depicted an affluent point of view. According to Leno&#x27;s biographer Barry Anthony, the two &quot;represented the opposite poles of cockney comedy&quot;.

For his music hall acts, Leno created characters that were based on observations about life in London, including , grocer&#x27;s assistants, beefeaters, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a Spanish bandit and a hairdresser. One such character was Mrs. Kelly, a gossip. Leno would sing a verse of a song, then begin a monologue, often his &quot;You know Mrs. Kelly?&quot; routine, which became a well-known catchphrase: &quot;You see we had a row once, and it was all through Mrs. Kelly. You know Mrs. Kelly, of course. ... Oh, you must know Mrs. Kelly; everybody knows Mrs. Kelly.&quot;
For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers and composers. One such composer was Harry King, who wrote many of Leno&#x27;s early successes. Other well-known composers of the day who supplied Leno with numbers included Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar. From 1890, Leno commissioned George Le Brunn to compose the incidental music to many of his songs, including &quot;The Detective&quot;, &quot;My Old Man&quot;, &quot;Chimney on Fire&quot;, &quot;The Fasting Man&quot;, &quot;The Jap&quot;, &quot;All Through A Little Piece of Bacon&quot; and &quot;The Detective Camera&quot;. Le Brunn also provided the incidental music for three of Leno&#x27;s best-known songs that depicted life in everyday occupations: &quot;The Railway Guard&quot; (1890), &quot;The Shopwalker&quot; and &quot;The Waiter&quot; (both from 1891). The songs in each piece became instantly distinctive and familiar to Leno&#x27;s audiences, but his occasional changes to the characterisations kept the sketches fresh and topical.

&quot;The Railway Guard&quot; featured Leno in a mad characterisation of a railway station guard dressed in an ill-fitting uniform, with an unkempt beard and a whistle. The character was created by exaggerating the behaviour that Leno saw in a real employee at Brixton station who concerned himself in other people&#x27;s business while, at the same time, not doing any work. &quot;The Shopwalker&quot; was full of comic one-liners and was heavily influenced by pantomime. Leno played the part of a shop assistant, again of manic demeanour, enticing imaginary clientele into the shop before launching into a frantic selling technique sung in verse. Leno&#x27;s depiction of &quot;The Waiter&quot;, dressed in an oversized dinner jacket and loose-fitting white dickey, which would flap up and hit his face, was of a man consumed in self-pity and indignation. Overworked, overwrought and overwhelmed by the number of his customers, the waiter gave out excuses for the bad service faster than the customers could complain:

===Pantomime===
Leno&#x27;s first London appearance in pantomime was as Dame Durden in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, which he performed at London&#x27;s Surrey Theatre in 1886, having been spotted singing &quot;Going to Buy Milk&quot; by the Surrey Theatre manager, George Conquest. Conquest also hired Leno&#x27;s wife to star in the production. The pantomime was a success, and Leno received rave reviews; as a result, he was booked to star as Tinpanz the Tinker in the following year&#x27;s pantomime, which had the unique title of &quot;Sinbad and the Little Old Man of the Sea; or, The Tinker, the Tailor, the Soldier, the Sailor, Apothecary, Ploughboy, Gentleman Thief&quot;.

After these pantomime performances proved popular with audiences, Leno was hired in 1888 by Augustus Harris, manager at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to appear in that year&#x27;s Christmas pantomime, &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. Harris&#x27;s pantomime productions at the huge theatre were known for their extravagance and splendour. Each one had a cast of over a hundred performers, ballet dancers, acrobats, marionettes and animals, and included an elaborate transformation scene and an energetic harlequinade. Often they were partly written by Harris. Herbert Campbell and Harry Nicholls starred with Leno in the next fifteen Christmas productions at Drury Lane. Campbell had appeared in the theatre&#x27;s previous five pantomimes and was a favourite of the writer of those productions, E. L. Blanchard. Blanchard left the theatre when Leno was hired, believing that music hall performers were unsuitable for his Christmas pantomimes. This was not a view shared by audiences or the critics, one of whom wrote: 
&quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; was a triumph: the theatre reported record attendance, and the run was extended until 27 April 1889. Leno considerably reduced his music-hall engagements as a consequence. Nevertheless, between April and October 1889, Leno appeared simultaneously at the Empire Theatre and the Oxford Music Hall, performing his one-man show. By this time, Leno was much in demand and had bookings for the next three years. On 9 May 1889 he starred for George P. Hawtrey in a matinee of &quot;Penelope&quot;, a musical version of a famous farce &quot;The Area Belle&quot;, to benefit the Holborn Lodge for Shop Girls. In this benefit, he played the role of Pitcher opposite the seasoned Gilbert and Sullivan performer Rutland Barrington. &quot;The Times&quot; considered that his performance treated the piece &quot;too much in the manner of pantomime&quot;. During Leno&#x27;s long association with the Drury Lane pantomimes, he appeared chiefly as the dame. After Harris died in 1896, Arthur Collins became the manager of the theatre and oversaw (and often helped to write) the pantomimes.

In their pantomimes, the diminutive Leno and the massive Campbell were a visually comic duo. They would often deviate from the script, improvising freely. This was met with some scepticism by producers, who feared that the scenes would not be funny to audiences and observed that, in any event, they were rarely at their best until a few nights after opening. George Bernard Shaw wrote of one appearance: &quot;I hope I never again have to endure anything more dismally futile&quot;, and the English essayist and caricaturist Max Beerbohm stated that &quot;Leno does not do himself justice collaborating with the public&quot;. He noted, however, that Leno &quot;was exceptional in giving each of his dames a personality of her own, from extravagant queen to artless gossip&quot;. In &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, Leno and Campbell caused the audience to laugh even when they could not see them: they would arrive on stage in closed palanquins and exchange the lines, &quot;Have you anything to do this afternoon, my dear?&quot; – &quot;No, I have nothing on&quot;, before being carried off again. Leno and Campbell&#x27;s pantomimes from 1889 were &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (1889 and 1899), &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1890 and 1900), &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; (1891 and 1903), &quot;Little Bo-Peep&quot; (1892), &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; (1893), &quot;Dick Whittington and His Cat&quot; (1894), &quot;Cinderella&quot; (1895), &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1896), &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; (1897) and the &quot;Forty Thieves&quot; (1898).
Leno considered the dame roles in two of his last pantomimes, &quot;Bluebeard&quot; (1901) and &quot;Mother Goose&quot; (1902), written by J. Hickory Wood, to be his favourites. He was paid £200 (£ in 2025 adjusted for inflation) for each of the pantomime seasons. Leno appeared at Drury Lane as Sister Anne in &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, a character described by Wood as &quot;a sprightly, somewhat below middle aged person who was of a coming on disposition and who had not yet abandoned hope&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; drama critic noted: &quot;It is a quite peculiar and original Sister Anne, who dances breakdowns and sings strange ballads to a still stranger harp and plays ping-pong with a frying-pan and potatoes and burlesques Sherlock Holmes and wears the oddest of garments and dresses her hair like Miss Morleena Kenwigs, and speaks in a piping voice – in short it is none other than Dan Leno whom we all know&quot;. &quot;Mother Goose&quot; provided Leno with one of the most challenging roles of his career, in which he was required to portray the same woman in several different guises. Wood&#x27;s idea, that neither fortune nor beauty would bring happiness, was illustrated by a series of magical character transformations. The poor, unkempt and generally ugly Mother Goose eventually became a rich and beautiful but tasteless parvenu, searching for a suitor. The production was one of Drury Lane&#x27;s most successful pantomimes, running until 28 March 1903.

===Later career===

In 1896, the impresario Milton Bode approached Leno with a proposal for a farcical musical comedy vehicle devised for him called &quot;Orlando Dando, the Volunteer&quot;, by Basil Hood with music by Walter Slaughter. Leno&#x27;s agent declined the offer, as his client was solidly booked for two years. Bode offered Leno £625 (£ in 2025 adjusted for inflation) for a six-week appearance in 1898. Upon hearing this, the comedian overrode his agent and accepted the offer. Leno toured the provinces in the piece and was an immediate success. So popular was his performance that Bode re-engaged him for a further two shows: the musical farce &quot;In Gay Piccadilly!&quot; (1899), by George R. Sims, in which Leno&#x27;s uncle, Johnny Danvers appeared (&quot;The Era&quot; said that Leno was &quot;attracting huge houses&quot; and called him &quot;excruciatingly funny&quot;); and the musical comedy &quot;Mr. Wix of Wickham&quot; (1902). Both toured after their original runs. In 1897, Leno went to America and made his debut on 12 April of that year at Hammerstein&#x27;s Olympia Music Hall on Broadway, where he was billed as &quot;The Funniest Man on Earth&quot;. Reviews were mixed: one newspaper reported that the house roared its approval, while another complained that Leno&#x27;s English humour was out of date. His American engagement came to an end a month later, and Leno said that it was &quot;the crown of my career&quot;. Despite his jubilation, Leno was conscious of the few negative reviews he had received and rejected all later offers to tour the United States and Australia.

The same year, the comedian lent his name and writing talents to &quot;Dan Leno&#x27;s Comic Journal&quot;. The paper was primarily aimed at young adults and featured a mythologised version of Leno – the first comic paper to take its name from, and base a central character on, a living person. Published by C. Arthur Pearson, Issue No. 1 appeared on 26 February 1898, and the paper sold 350,000 copies a year. Leno wrote most of the paper&#x27;s comic stories and jokes, and Tom Browne contributed many of the illustrations. The comedian retained editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit. The Journal was known for its slogans, including &quot;One Touch of Leno Makes the Whole World Grin&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t wash clothes but will mangle melancholy&quot;. The cover always showed a caricature of Leno and his editorial staff at work and play. Inside, the features included &quot;Daniel&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;Moans from the Martyr&quot;, two yarns, a couple of dozen cartoons and &quot;Leno&#x27;s Latest – Fresh Jokes and Wheezes Made on the Premises&quot;. After a run of nearly two years the novelty wore off, and Leno lost interest. The paper shut down on 2 December 1899.
A journalist wrote, in the late 1890s, that Leno was &quot;probably the highest paid funny man in the world&quot;. In 1898, Leno, Herbert Campbell and Danvers formed a consortium to build the Granville Theatre in Fulham, which was demolished in 1971. Leno published an autobiography, &quot;Dan Leno: Hys Booke&quot;, in 1899, possibly assisted by a ghostwriter, T. C. Elder. Leno&#x27;s biographer J. Hickory Wood commented: &quot;I can honestly say that I never saw him absolutely at rest. He was always doing something, and had something else to do afterwards; or he had just been somewhere, was going somewhere else, and had several other appointments to follow.&quot; That year, Leno performed the role of &quot;waxi omo&quot; (a slang expression for a black-face performer) in the Doo-da-Day Minstrels, an act that included Danvers, Campbell, Bransby Williams, Joe Elvin and Eugene Stratton. The troupe&#x27;s only performance was at the London Pavilion on 29 May 1899 as part of a benefit. Leno&#x27;s song &quot;The Funny Little Nigger&quot; greatly amused the audience. His biographer Barry Anthony considered the performance to be &quot;more or less, the last gasp of black-face minstrelsy in Britain&quot;.

Between 1901 and 1903, Leno recorded more than twenty-five songs and monologues on the Gramophone and Typewriter Company label. He also made 14 short films towards the end of his life, in which he portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle or opening a bottle of champagne. On 26 November 1901, Leno, along with Seymour Hicks and his wife, the actress Ellaline Terriss, was invited to Sandringham House to take part in a Royal Command Performance to entertain King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, their son George and his wife, Mary, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Leno performed a thirty-five-minute solo act that included two of his best-known songs: &quot;How to Buy a House&quot; and &quot;The Huntsman&quot;. After the performance, Leno reported, &quot;The King, the Queen and the Prince of Wales all very kindly shook hands with me and told me how much they had enjoyed it. The Princess of Wales was just going to shake hands with me, when she looked at my face, and couldn&#x27;t do it for some time, because she laughed so much. I wasn&#x27;t intending to look funny – I was really trying to look dignified and courtly; but I suppose I couldn&#x27;t help myself.&quot; As a memento, the King presented Leno with a jewel-encrusted royal tie pin, and thereafter, Leno became known as &quot;the King&#x27;s Jester&quot;. Leno was the first music hall performer to give a Royal Command Performance during the King&#x27;s reign.

==Personal life==
In 1883, Leno met Sarah Lydia Reynolds (1866–1942), a young dancer and comedy singer from Birmingham, while both were appearing at King Ohmy&#x27;s Circus of Varieties, Rochdale. The daughter of a stage carpenter, Lydia, as she was known professionally, was already an accomplished actress as a teenager: of her performance in &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; in 1881, one critic wrote that she &quot;played Zorlida very well for a young artiste. She is well known at this theatre and with proper training will prove a very clever actress.&quot; She and Leno married in 1884 in a discreet ceremony at St. George&#x27;s Church, in Hulme, Manchester, soon after the birth of their first daughter, Georgina. A second child died in infancy, and John was born in 1888. Their three youngest children – Ernest (b. 1889), Sidney (b. 1891) and May (b. 1896) – all followed their father onto the stage. Sidney later performed as Dan Leno, Jr. After Leno&#x27;s mother and stepfather retired from performing, Leno supported them financially until their deaths.

Leno owned &quot;an acre or so&quot; of land at the back of his house in Clapham Park, producing cabbages, potatoes, poultry, butter and eggs. In 1898, Leno and his family moved to 56 Akerman Road, Lambeth, where they lived for several years. A blue plaque was erected there in 1962 by the London County Council.

===Charity and fundraising===
The Terriers Association was established in 1890 to help retired artists in need of financial help. Leno was an active fundraiser in this and in the Music Hall Benevolent Fund, of which he became the president. He was an early member of the entertainment charity Grand Order of Water Rats, which helps performers who are in financial need, and served as its leader, the King Rat, in 1891, 1892 and 1897. Near the end of his life, Leno co-founded The Music Hall Artistes Railway Association, which entered a partnership with the Water Rats to form music hall&#x27;s first trade union. Some of Leno&#x27;s charity was discreet and unpublicised.

In the late 1890s, Leno formed a cricket team called the &quot;Dainties&quot;, for which he recruited many of the day&#x27;s leading comedians and music hall stars. They played for charity against a variety of amateur teams willing to put up with their comedic mayhem, such as London&#x27;s Metropolitan Police Force; Leno&#x27;s and his teammates&#x27; tomfoolery on the green amused the large crowds that they drew. From 1898 to 1903, the Dainties continued to play matches across London. Two films of action from the matches were produced in 1900 for audiences of the new medium of cinema. In September 1901, at a major charity match, the press noted the carnival atmosphere. The comedians wore silly costumes – Leno was dressed as an undertaker and later as a schoolgirl riding a camel. Bands played, and clowns circulated through the crowd. The rival team of professional Surrey cricketers were persuaded to wear tall hats during the match. 18,000 spectators attended, contributing funds for music hall and cricketers&#x27; charities, among others.

===Decline and mental breakdown===

Leno began to drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, like his father and stepfather before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno&#x27;s angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often a result of his diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left stuck up a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of &quot;Mother Goose&quot; in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre&#x27;s management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: &quot;Governor, it&#x27;s a magnificent present! I congratulate you and you deserve it!&quot;

Frustrated at not being accepted as a serious actor, Leno became obsessed with the idea of playing &quot;Richard III&quot; and other great Shakespearean roles, inundating the actor–manager Herbert Beerbohm Tree with his proposals. After his final run of &quot;Mother Goose&quot; at the Drury Lane Theatre in early 1903, Leno&#x27;s delusions overwhelmed him. On the closing evening, and again soon afterwards, he travelled to the home of Constance Collier, who was Beerbohm Tree&#x27;s leading lady at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, and also followed her to rehearsal there. He attempted to persuade her to act alongside him in a Shakespearean season that Leno was willing to fund. On the second visit to her home, Leno brought Collier a diamond brooch. Recognising that Leno was having a mental breakdown, she gently refused his offer, and Leno left distraught.

Two days later, he was admitted into Camberwell House Lunatic Asylum, London, where he spent several months under the care of Dr. Savage, who treated Leno with &quot;peace and quiet and a little water colouring&quot;. On his second day, Leno told a nurse that the clock was wrong. When she stated that it was right, Leno remarked, &quot;Well if it&#x27;s right, then what&#x27;s it doing here?&quot; Leno made several attempts to leave the asylum, twice being successful. He was found each time and promptly returned.

===Last year and death===

Upon Leno&#x27;s release from the institution in October 1903, the press offered much welcoming commentary and speculated as to whether he would appear that year in the Drury Lane pantomime, scheduled to be &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot;. Concerned that Leno might suffer a relapse, Arthur Collins employed Marie Lloyd to take his place. By the time of rehearsals, however, Leno persuaded Collins that he was well enough to take part, and the cast was reshuffled to accommodate him. Leno appeared with success. Upon hearing his signature song, the audience reportedly gave him a standing ovation that lasted five minutes. He received a telegram from the King congratulating him on his performance.

Leno&#x27;s stage partner Herbert Campbell died in July 1904, shortly after the pantomime, following an accident at the age of fifty-seven. The death affected Leno deeply, and he went into a decline. At that time, he was appearing at the London Pavilion, but the show had to be cancelled owing to his inability to remember his lines. So harsh were the critics that Leno wrote a statement, published in &quot;The Era&quot;, to defend the show&#x27;s originality. On 20 October 1904, Leno gave his last performance in the show. Afterwards, he stopped at the Belgrave Hospital for Children in Kennington, of which he was vice-president, to leave a donation.

Leno died at his home in London on 31 October 1904, aged 43, and was buried at Lambeth Cemetery, London. The cause of death is not known. His death and funeral were national news. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote in its obituary: &quot;There was only one Dan. His methods were inimitable; his face was indeed his fortune ... Who has seen him in any of his disguises and has failed to laugh?&quot; Max Beerbohm later said of Leno&#x27;s death: &quot;So little and frail a lantern could not long harbour so big a flame&quot;.

Leno is commemorated by the Dan Leno Gardens on Patmos Road in London, situated behind St John the Divine, Kennington, which are designated for use by disabled people.

<text>Emmanuel de Grouchy, marquis de Grouchy (; 23 October 176629 May 1847) was a French military leader who served during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was the last Marshal of the Empire to be created by Napoleon, and is best known for his actions during the Waterloo campaign.

==Early life==
Grouchy was born in Paris on 23 October 1766 into a family of the &quot;noblesse d&#x27;épée&quot;, the son of François-Jacques de Grouchy, 1st Marquis de Grouchy (born 1715) and Gilberte Fréteau de Pény (died 1793). He was raised at the Château de Villette (known as &quot;the little Versailles&quot;), his family&#x27;s estate in Condécourt, northwest of Paris. He was the brother of Sophie de Condorcet, a salon hostess and writer. Another sister, Charlotte, was the wife of physiologist and philosopher Pierre Cabanis.

Destined to a military career from birth, Grouchy attended the Artillery School of Strasbourg from 1780 to 1781, graduating as lieutenant in the La Fère Regiment. He was later transferred to the cavalry in 1782, and was appointed captain in the Royal Foreign Regiment in 1784. In 1785, Grouchy was presented to King Louis XVI, and the next year he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the Scottish Company of the King&#x27;s Life Guards.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
Despite his aristocratic birth and his connection to the court, Grouchy was a convinced supporter of the French Revolution in 1789, along with his brother-in-law, the Marquis de Condorcet, and had in consequence to leave the Life Guards. Refusing to emigrate, Grouchy remained faithful to the revolutionary cause and rejoined the army. By 1791 he was lieutenant colonel of the 12th Regiment of &quot;chasseurs à cheval&quot;. In 1792 he served during the invasion of Savoy, first as colonel of the 12th Regiment of &quot;chasseurs à cheval&quot; then of the 2nd Dragoon Regiment. After the campaign of 1793, Grouchy was promoted to brigade general and was made a cavalry commander in the Army of the Alps.

In 1794, Grouchy was sent to the War in the Vendée, where he distinguished himself defending Nantes from Royalist rebels led by François de Charette, for which he received the rank of general of division. Shortly afterwards, he was expelled from the army as being of noble birth, and remained as a simple soldier in the National Guard. Grouchy was reinstated to his rank the next year and returned to Western France, where he served under General Lazare Hoche in the defence against the Quiberon Expedition in July 1795. In late 1796, he took part in the abortive expedition to Ireland as Hoche&#x27;s second-in-command, and the next year he was assigned to the Army of the North.

Grouchy was deployed to Italy in 1798 under the orders of General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan. By skillful measures, he was able to persuade the King of Sardinia, Charles Emmanuel IV, to renounce his rule over Piedmont, then received from the Directory the task of organizing the conquered territory. He asked to join the Egyptian campaign, but General Napoleon Bonaparte preferred General Louis-Alexandre Berthier to him. Remaining with the Army of Italy, Grouchy distinguished himself greatly as a divisional commander in the 1799 campaign against the Austrians and Russians. In covering the retreat of the French after the defeat at the Battle of Novi, Grouchy received fourteen wounds and was taken prisoner.
During his captivity, which lasted nearly a year, Grouchy protested in a letter against Bonaparte&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état of 18 Brumaire that established the Consulate, and had this letter signed by several officers. Despite this protest, upon his release he was at once re-employed by the First Consul, and distinguished himself again at the Battle of Hohenlinden. After the Peace of Lunéville he was appointed Inspector General of the Cavalry. Following the Cadoudal affair, Grouchy was under Bonaparte&#x27;s suspicion for some time due to his association with General Jean Moreau, but soon returned to favor, and in 1803 he received the mission of having Charles Louis recognized as King of Etruria.

==Napoleonic Wars==
Grouchy took part in the Ulm campaign in 1805, during the War of the Third Coalition. He later fought with distinction at the battles of Eylau and Friedland in 1807. Grouchy entered Spain in 1808 commanding the twelve squadrons (2,850 men) of the Cavalry Division of Marshal Moncey&#x27;s Corps of Observation of the Ocean Coast, and was appointed governor of Madrid.
At the time of the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, Grouchy commanded the cavalry of the Army of Italy in Viceroy Eugène de Beauharnais&#x27;s advance to Vienna, and contributed to the victories at the battles of Raab and Wagram. As a reward for his services, Grouchy was made Colonel General of the &quot;chasseurs à cheval&quot; of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, and received the title of &quot;comte d&#x27;Empire&quot;.

During the Russian campaign in 1812, Grouchy was appointed commander of the III Cavalry Corps and led the corps at Smolensk and Borodino. During the retreat from Moscow, Napoleon appointed him to command the Sacred Squadron, a unit composed exclusively of picked officers and responsible for the emperor&#x27;s personal protection. His almost continuous service with the cavalry led Napoleon to decline in 1813 to place Grouchy at the head of an army corps, and Grouchy thereupon retired to his estates, taking no part in the German campaign of 1813.

When the allies invaded France in early 1814, Grouchy hastened to take part in the defensive campaign and asked to return to service. Napoleon gave him the command of a cavalry division, which Grouchy skillfully lead at the battles of Brienne, La Rothière, Vauchamps, and Craonne, where he was severely wounded. Upon Napoleon&#x27;s abdication and the Bourbon Restoration, Grouchy lost his rank of Colonel General of the &quot;chasseurs à cheval&quot;, which was given to the Duke of Berry, and was allowed to retire by King Louis XVIII.

===Hundred Days===

In March 1815, Grouchy rallied to Napoleon on his return to power during the Hundred Days. He was made a Marshal of the Empire on 5 April 1815 (against the recommendation of Marshal Davout, then Minister for War), and received the command of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th divisions. Grouchy directed the operations against the Duke of Angoulême&#x27;s Royalist army in Southern France. After the Royalists were defeated, he unwillingly allowed the Duke to leave the country under the terms of the , which Grouchy had initially refused to recognize. He then organized the defences in the Alpine front, and was made a Peer of France on 2 June.

In the Waterloo Campaign, Grouchy commanded the reserve cavalry of the army, and after the Battle of Ligny he was appointed to command the right wing to pursue the Prussians. Napoleon sent Grouchy to pursue a part of the retreating Prussian army under the command of General Johann von Thielmann. On 17 June, Grouchy was unable to close with the Prussians. Despite hearing the cannon sound from the nearby Battle of Waterloo, he decided to follow the Prussians along the route literally specified in his orders, issued by Napoleon via Marshal Soult, while the Coalition armies attempted to combine forces to defeat Napoleon. He won a tactical victory over the Prussian army&#x27;s rearguard at the Battle of Wavre on 18–19 June 1815, but the delaying action by III Corps allowed the main Prussian force to join Wellington at Waterloo while preventing Grouchy from doing the same.

So far as resistance was possible after the great disaster, Grouchy made it, gathering up the remnants of Napoleon&#x27;s army and retiring, swiftly and unbroken, to Paris. After Napoleon&#x27;s second abdication, he addressed a proclamation to his soldiers in support of Napoleon II. After interposing his reorganized forces between the enemy and the capital, Grouchy resigned his command into the hands of Marshal Davout.

==Later life==

After the second restoration of the Bourbons, an attempt to have Grouchy condemned to death by a court-martial failed; however, he was proscribed and went into exile in the United States, settling in Philadelphia along with several other French officers of the Hundred Days. He was amnestied by King Louis XVIII in November 1819 and departed for France in May 1820. Upon his return Grouchy was reinstated as general, but not as marshal nor as peer of France. For many years thereafter he was equally an object of aversion to the court party, as a member of their own class who had joined the Revolution and Napoleon, and to his comrades of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; as the supposed betrayer of Napoleon.

Grouchy returned to favor after the overthrow of the Bourbons in the Revolution of 1830. King Louis Philippe gave him back the marshal&#x27;s baton in 1831 and restored him to the Chamber of Peers in 1832. Grouchy died in Saint-Étienne while returning from a trip to Italy on 29 May 1847, aged 80. He was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

==Family==
He was married firstly (1785) to Cécile le Doulcet de Pontécoulant (1767–1827), sister of Louis Gustave le Doulcet, comte de Pontécoulant, by whom he had 4 children:
*Ernestine (1787–1866)
*Alphonse (1789–1864)
*Aimee-Clementine (1791–1826)
*Victor (1796–1864)

He married secondly, in 1827, Joséphine-Fanny Hua (1802–1889) and had 1 daughter:
*Noemie (1830–1843)

== Works ==
Grouchy published the following:
* &quot;Observations sur la relation de la campagne de 1815 par le général de Gourgaud&quot; (Philadelphia and Paris, 1818)
* &quot;Refutation de quelques articles des mémoires de M. le Duc de Rovigo&quot; (Paris,1829)
* &quot;Fragments Historiques Relatifs a la Campagne de 1815 et a la Bataille de Waterloo&quot; (Paris, 1829–1830) — in reply to Barthélemy and Méry, and to Marshal Gérard
* &quot;Reclamation du marchal de Grouchy&quot; (Paris, 1834)
* &quot;Plainte contre le general Baron Berthezène&quot; — Berthezène, formerly a divisional commander under Gérard, stated in reply to this defence that he had no intention of accusing Grouchy of ill faith.

<text>Leigh is a town in Greater Manchester, England, on low-lying land northwest of Chat Moss.

Within the boundaries of the historic county of Lancashire, Leigh was originally the centre of a large ecclesiastical parish covering six vills or townships. When the three townships of Pennington, Westleigh and Bedford merged in 1875, forming the Leigh Local Board District, Leigh became the official name for the town, although it had been applied to the area of Pennington and Westleigh around the parish church for many centuries.
The town became an urban district in 1894 when part of Atherton was added. In 1899 Leigh became a municipal borough. The first town hall was built on King Street and replaced by the present building in 1907.

Originally an agricultural area (noted for dairy farming), domestic spinning and weaving led to a considerable silk industry and, in the 20th century, the cotton industry. Leigh also exploited the underlying coal measures, particularly after the town was connected to the canals and railways. Leigh had an important engineering base. The legacy of Leigh&#x27;s industrial past can be seen in the remaining red brick mills – some of which are listed buildings – although it is now a mainly residential town, with Edwardian and Victorian terraced housing packed around the town centre. Leigh&#x27;s present-day economy is based largely on the retail sector.

== History ==

=== Toponymy ===
Leigh is derived from the Old English &quot;leah&quot; which meant a place at the wood or woodland clearing, a glade and subsequently a pasture or meadow, it was spelt Legh in 1276. Other recorded spellings include Leech, 1264; Leeche, 1268; Leghthe, 1305; Leght, 1417; Lech, 1451; Legh, 16th century. As its name denotes it was a district rich in meadow and pasture land, and the produce of its dairies, the Leigh cheese, was formerly noted for its excellence.
Westleigh, the west clearing, was Westeley in 1237, Westlegh in 1238 and Westlay in Legh in 1292.
Pennington was recorded as Pininton and Pynynton in 1246 and 1360, Penynton in 1305, Pynyngton in 1351 and 1442 and Penyngton in 1443, the ending &quot;tun&quot; denotes an enclosure, farmstead or manor in Old English. The ford of Beda, probably through the Pennington Brook gave its name to Bedford which was recorded as Beneford from 1200 to 1221 and Bedeford in 1200 and 1296.

=== Early history ===

The earliest signs of human activity in Leigh are evidenced by a Neolithic stone axe found in Pennington and a bronze spearhead from south of Gas Street. A single Roman coin was found at Butts in Bedford. After the Roman departure from Britain, and into the history of Anglo-Saxon England, nothing was written about Leigh. However, evidence for the presence of Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part of the country is provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix &quot;leah&quot;, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.

=== Townships ===
In the 12th century the ancient parish of Leigh was made up of six townships, including Pennington, Bedford, Westleigh, Atherton, Astley, and Tyldesley cum Shakerley. Weekly markets were held by the parish church and a cattle fair held twice-yearly.

The land to the south of Atherton includes the feudal barony of Atherleigh, created by Queen Elizabeth, and Bedford manor, which was mentioned in documents in 1202 when it was held by Sir Henry de Kighley whose family held it until the 16th century, but never actually lived there.
The Shuttleworths, landowners from the 14th century, were another prominent Bedford family. Richard Shuttleworth married a daughter of the Urmstons from Westleigh and brought part of
the Westleigh inheritance to Bedford. This family lived at Shuttleworth House, or Sandypool Farm as it is also known, which is south of the Bridgewater Canal near to the old manor house, Bedford Hall, which survives today as a Grade II listed building. Another prominent Bedford family, the Sales of Hope Carr Hall, had a great deal of influence in Bedford for over 400 years, and owned more land than the Shuttleworths. The family were recusants and secretly kept the &quot;old faith&quot; when Roman Catholicism was subject to civil or criminal penalties. Hope Carr Hall was moated as was nearby Brick House.

The manor house of Westleigh was at Higher Hall and existed in Richard I&#x27;s time (1189–1199). In 1292 Sigreda, the heiress of the manor, married Richard de Urmston, and the manor passed to the Urmston family and remained there until the last of the male Urmstons died in 1659. It was later abandoned because of mining subsidence and Westleigh Old Hall became the manor by repute. The Ranicars and the Marsh families lived here. Westleigh Old Hall was another Leigh hall that had a moat.

The Pennington family owned Pennington Hall from about 1200 until they were replaced by the Bradshaw or Bradshaighs in 1312. The Bradshaws held the manor until 1703 when John, the last of the male line died. Pennington Hall was rebuilt in 1748 by the then-owner Samuel Hilton and in 1807 sold to the Gaskell family of Thornes, Wakefield, who let it to a succession of tenants. Around 1840 James Pownall, a founder member of the silk manufacturing firm, Bickham and Pownall, was a tenant. Later occupants were Charles Jackson, a cotton manufacturer, Jabez Johnson, and F.W. Bouth founder of Bouth&#x27;s Mill in 1862, The last resident was the brewer George Shaw. On 3 December 1919 George Shaw &amp; Co Ltd offered the hall and grounds to the people of Leigh. The gift was accepted and opened to the public on 25 August 1920. The hall was converted to a museum and art gallery in 1928 but was demolished in 1963. The grounds are now Pennington Park.

=== Civil War ===

Leigh was divided in its allegiance during the English Civil War, some of the population supporting the Royalists&#x27; cause while others supported the Parliamentarians. A battle was fought in the town on 2 December 1642, when a group of Chowbenters, men from neighbouring Atherton, beat back and then routed Cavalier troops under the command of James Stanley, the 7th Earl of Derby.
Sir Thomas Tyldesley of Myerscough and Morleys Hall, Astley, was killed on 25 August 1651 at the Battle of Wigan Lane and is buried in the Tyldesley Chapel in Leigh Parish Church.
The Earl of Derby passed through Leigh again in 1651, when he spent his last night in the King&#x27;s Arms, before going on to his execution outside Ye Olde Man &amp; Scythe Inn in Bolton.

=== Industrial Revolution ===

At the end of the 16th century, although agriculture and the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to develop as a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first, the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by the end of the 17th-century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.
It is a tradition in the town that a local man, Thomas Highs, was the inventor of a spinning jenny and the water frame in the 1760s, the latter invention being pirated by Richard Arkwright, who subsequently made a fortune from the patent royalties.
These 18th-century improvements to the spinning process meant that handloom weavers were in great demand. but as power looms were introduced in factories in Manchester there was less work for them and there was serious unemployment in the town. In 1827 silk weaving began in Leigh, either as the result of a dispute or a labour shortage in the Middleton silk industry. William Walker was a middleman who opened the first silk mill in Leigh in 1828, and others quickly followed, including James Pownall and Henry Hilton, whose mill survived until 1926.
Several cotton mills were built in Leigh after the mid-1830s, and some silk mills were converted to cotton after 1870.

The &quot;Leigth Feight&quot; took place on 14 August 1839. The chartists had called for a strike at a time when there was social unrest over the high levels of unemployment and high cost of living. A mob of at least 2,000 gathered in Leigh. About 400–500 workers from Chowbent threatened to burn down Hayes Mill. A detachment of troops from Haydock was called out, and special constables sworn in by the local magistrate. The Riot Act was read by Squire Thomas Withington of Culcheth Hall and for a while the mob dispersed but reassembled later. Many were injured in the fighting that took place and arrests were made. Those arrested were severely punished, while others ensured that radicalism continued in Leigh, leading eventually to electoral reform and universal suffrage.

The large multi-storey spinning mills came later, and five survive today. Mill complexes were built at Kirkhall Lane and Firs Lane in Westleigh, and in Pennington and Bedford. Leigh Spinners is a Grade II* listed building. Mather Lane Mill close to the Bridgewater Canal is a Grade II listed building. More than 6,000 people were employed in textiles in Leigh in 1911.

=== Coal mining ===

There had been drift mines in Westleigh since the 12th century but during the second half of the 19th century it became possible to mine the deeper seams and coal began to be an important industry and coal mining became the largest user of labour after the textile industry in Leigh. Parsonage Colliery, the last pit to be sunk in Leigh, was one of the deepest in the country, going down to over . The extent of mining at Parsonage Colliery increased in the 1960s with the driving of the Horizon Tunnel, which accessed previously inaccessible seams around 6 ft (2 m) high that were easy to work. The seams were wet, and a series of pumps was used to remove the water into underground canals before it was pumped into the canal at Leigh. The winding engine at Parsonage was a steam engine, fuelled by methane extracted from the workings, while the neighbouring Bickershaw Colliery had a superior electric system. In 1974, the two pits were linked underground, and all coal was wound at Bickershaw, which had better facilities, while Parsonage was used for supplies. The entire Lancashire Coalfield is closed to deep mining, although several open-cast mines are still in operation elsewhere in the county.

Mining disasters in Leigh included the explosion of firedamp which caused the deaths of 38 miners at Bedford Colliery on 13 August 1886. There were several accidents at Bickershaw Colliery, but the most serious was in 1932, when 19 men were drowned in the sump at the bottom of the shaft after an overwind of the cage.


=== Manufacturing ===
Other notable industry included the tractor factory of David Brown Limited, which was in Leigh following the acquisition in 1955 of Harrison, McGregor and Guest&#x27;s Albion range of farm machinery products. Rope-manufacture was another local industry: Mansley&#x27;s Rope works on Twist Lane made rope by hand, using a rope walk. The factory burnt down in 1912. Anchor Cables had a large works close to the Bridgewater Canal. The company was bought by Callender&#x27;s Cables, in 1903, later to become British Insulated Callender&#x27;s Cables (BICC), part of Balfour Beatty. Another major 20th century employer was Sutcliffe Speakman, which made activated carbon and brick-making equipment.

== Governance ==

Leigh is covered by three electoral wards, Leigh Central &amp; Higher Folds, Leigh South and Leigh West, of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, although Atherton South does include some properties in Leigh. Each ward elects three councillors to the 75-member metropolitan borough council, Wigan&#x27;s local authority. As of 2009, all nine ward councillors for Leigh, including leader of the council, Lord Smith of Leigh, are members of the Labour Party who control the council.

Historically, Leigh&#x27;s townships were in the Hundred of West Derby, a judicial division of southwest Lancashire. Pennington, Westleigh and Bedford were three of the six townships or vills that made up the ancient parish of Leigh. The townships existed before the parish.

Under the terms of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 the townships formed part of Leigh Poor Law Union, established on 26 January 1837 and responsible for an area covering the whole of the ancient parish and part of Winwick. Workhouses in Pennington, Culcheth, Tyldesley and Lowton were replaced by Leigh Union workhouse at Atherleigh in the 1850s. In 1875 Leigh Local Board of Health was established, covering the areas of the former Bedford, Pennington and Westleigh Local Boards of Health. In 1894 the area of the Local Board, together with part of Atherton township, became Leigh Urban District, which was granted honorific borough status in 1899 becoming the Municipal Borough of Leigh.

In the early twentieth century Leigh saw continued activism for women&#x27;s suffrage, with local activity by the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, the North of England Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, the Leigh Women&#x27;s Liberal Association and local branches of the Women&#x27;s Labour League.
In 1969 there was an exchange of very small areas with Golborne Urban District. Following the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Leigh was abolished and its territory included as part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of Greater Manchester. In 1998, an area (Lately Common) was further ceded to the Borough of Warrington – one of the few parts of England to have been in three different counties since the mid-20th century: Lancashire, then Greater Manchester, then Cheshire.

Andy Burnham represented the parliamentary seat for Leigh for the Labour Party from 2001 general election. Between 10  June 2009 and the 2010 general election he was Secretary of State at the Department of Health. At the 2010 general election Burnham retained the Leigh seat with 24,295 votes and a majority of 15,011, representing 51.3% of the vote. Burnham was re-elected MP for the Leigh constituency in 2015 with 24,312 votes which was 53.9% of the total vote cast. He stepped down in 2017 to stand as a candidate for the position of Mayor of Greater Manchester. Jo Platt, representing Labour, was elected in 2017 with 26,347 votes which was 56.2% of the total votes cast. Jo Platt was defeated in the 2019 General Election, by James Grundy: the first ever Conservative representative for Leigh.
== Geography ==
Leigh is low-lying; land to the south and east, close to Chat Moss, is above mean sea level. The highest land, to the north and west, rises gently to . Astley and Bedford Mosses are fragments of the raised bog that once covered a large area north of the River Mersey and along with Holcroft and Risley Mosses are part of Manchester Mosses, a European Union designated Special Area of Conservation. The area is in the River Mersey Basin; drained into the Mersey by several streams, including the Westleigh and Pennington Brooks that join others flowing through Bedford to form the Glaze Brook. The southeast of the town has alluvial and peaty soils, but the rest is loam overlaying sandstone, or coal measures in the north. Magnesian limestone occurs in Bedford and neighbouring Astley. Mining subsidence and flooding have caused the formation of &quot;flashes&quot; to the south and west of the town, the largest of which is south of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Pennington. Pennington Flash Country Park is a country park and nature reserve with a flash or lake.

Leigh is crossed by the Bolton to St Helens Road high road, an old packhorse route that became a turnpike road in 1762. The A579 road bypasses the town centre using the line of the Bolton and Leigh Railway. The Bridgewater Canal and the Leigh Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal cross the town west to east, the canals meeting at Leigh Bridge just south of the town centre.
In the 1930s the &quot;A580 &quot;East Lancashire Road&quot;&quot; was built crossing to the south of the town.
== Demography ==

At the time of the United Kingdom Census 2001, according to the Office for National Statistics, the Urban Subdivision of Leigh was part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and had a total resident population of 43,006, of which 20,990 (48.8%) were male and 22,016 (51.2%) were female, with 18,270 households. The settlement occupied , compared with in the 1991 census. Its population density was 48.65 people per hectare compared with an average of 40.20 across the Greater Manchester Urban Area. The median age of the population was 37, compared with 36 within the Greater Manchester Urban Area and 37 across England and Wales.

The majority of the population of Leigh were born in England (95.92%); 2.10% were born elsewhere within the United Kingdom, 0.95% within the rest of the European Union, and 1.47% elsewhere in the world.

Data on religious beliefs across the town in the 2001 census show that 85.5% declared themselves to be Christian, 7.6% said they held no religion, and 0.6% reported themselves as Muslim.

Most of Leigh is within the Warrington &amp; Wigan travel to work area (TTWA), whilst part of the eastern side of the town is within the Manchester TTWA. The entire town is within the Manchester larger urban zone.

At the time of the 2001 Census, there were 19,051 people (44.3%) in employment who were resident within Leigh. Of these, 18.36% worked within the wholesale and retail trade, including repair of motor vehicles; 21.60% worked within manufacturing industry; and 11.99% worked within the health and social work sector. 45.16% of households owned a single car or van, with 30.77% owning none. The average car ownership per household was 0.98, compared with 0.93 across the Greater Manchester Urban Area.

=== Population change ===
== Economy ==

Leigh has a traditional town centre with daily outdoor and indoor markets. Part of the town centre is pedestrianised and there are local independent and multiple retailers. The Spinning Gate Centre in the centre of town has about thirty retail units.
A retail park developed on the old Parsonage Colliery site is within walking distance of the town centre.

Opened in 2008 Leigh Sports Village has an 12
,000-capacity stadium (anchored by Leigh Leopards  and shared with the reserves of Manchester United), an athletics arena for Leigh Harriers, facilities for Leigh East Rugby League Club, a college campus, hotel, leisure retail and business facilities for the community. In 2011 a Morrisons store opened at the sports village. Additionally, Manchester United&#x27;s main women&#x27;s team began to play home games at the stadium in 2018.

Another regeneration project on the site of the former Bickershaw Colliery complex which closed in 1992 will redevelop the site and canal side with a country park and housing.
In 2011 &quot;The Loom&quot; a £50million retail development opened on the north side of the Bridgewater Canal with a seven-screen cinema, Tesco Extra store, Nando&#x27;s and Frankie and Benny&#x27;s.

== Landmarks ==
Major landmarks in Leigh are the red sandstone parish church and across the civic square, Leigh Town Hall and its associated shops on Market Street. The Grade II listed Obelisk that replaced the original market cross is also situated here. Many town centre buildings including the Boar&#x27;s Head public house are in red Ruabon or Accrington bricks, often with gables and terracotta dressings. There are several large multi-storey cotton mills built along the Bridgewater Canal that are a reminder of Leigh&#x27;s textile industry but most are now underused and deteriorating despite listed building status. Leigh&#x27;s War Memorial by local architect J.C. Prestwich is at the junction of Church Street and Silk Street and is a Grade II listed structure. St Joseph&#x27;s Church and St Thomas&#x27;s Church on opposite sides of Chapel Street are both imposing churches using different materials and styles.

== Transport ==

Historically, Leigh was well connected with local transport infrastructure but, with the closure of the railway in 1969, this is no longer the case. Leigh became, and remains, one of the largest towns in Britain without direct access to the National Rail network. Public transport in the area is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester.

===Buses===
There are bus services operated by First Greater Manchester, Diamond Bus North West, Stagecoach Manchester, Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses, Arriva North West, Vision Bus and Tyrers from Leigh bus station to many local destinations including Wigan, Bolton, Warrington, Manchester and St Helens. There had been suggestions to reopen the railway via Tyldesley to Manchester, but a guided busway scheme was chosen for the route; this decision was not universally popular. Construction commenced in 2012 and the Leigh-Salford-Manchester Bus Rapid Transit opened on 3 April 2016.

=== Canals ===

The Bridgewater Canal was extended from Worsley to the middle of Leigh in 1795. In 1819 the fifth Leeds and Liverpool Canal Act was passed for the construction of the Leigh Branch and by 1820 the Leigh branch canal was cut from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Poolstock, Wigan to meet the Bridgewater at Leigh Bridge, giving access from Leigh to all parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.

=== Railways ===

The nearest railway station to Leigh is at Atherton, to the north; it provides regular services between Wigan and Manchester, operated by Northern. This leaves the bus station as Leigh&#x27;s only public transport link.

Leigh was the southern terminus of the Bolton and Leigh Railway; George Stephenson carried out the survey for the line. It opened between Bolton and William Hulton&#x27;s coal mines at Chequerbent for freight on 1 August 1828 and to the terminus at the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Leigh in March 1830. Passengers were carried from 13 June 1831. The first locomotive on the line was an 0-4-0 called the Lancashire Witch. The railway station was at Westleigh. Later the line was extended southwards to Pennington. Atherleigh opened in 1935. The line was closed to passenger traffic on 29 March 1954, and later closed completely.

In 1861, the London and North Western Railway revived powers granted to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to build a railway from Manchester via Eccles and Tyldesley to Wigan with a branch to Kenyon Junction on the Liverpool to Manchester Line via Leigh and Pennington. The station, originally named &quot;Bedford Leigh&quot; served the town. The railway crossed the town on a viaduct which has since been largely demolished; it closed in May 1969. After the reopening of Mansfield and Corby railway stations, Leigh is now one of the largest towns in Great Britain without a railway station. Numerous colliery lines crossed the town but, with the closure of the collieries, these were no longer required.

=== Trams and trolley buses ===
In 1900, a Bill authorising the South Lancashire Tramways Company to construct over of tramway in southern Lancashire was given Royal Assent.
However, by November 1900 the South Lancashire Electric Traction and Power Company had acquired the shares. The first section of tramway opened on 20 October 1902 between Lowton and Four Lanes Ends via Leigh and Atherton. The company got into financial difficulty and in turn became Lancashire United Tramways later Lancashire United Transport. On 16 December 1933, the last tram service ran from Leigh to Four Lane Ends and the next day trolley buses took over.
An Act of 4 August 1920 authorised Leigh Municipal Borough to run buses. A garage built on Windermere Road was soon outgrown and replaced by one on Holden Road. The corporation had a fleet of 70 vehicles during World War II.

== Education ==

Leigh Grammar School existed in 1655 but its foundation is unclear. The building was next to the churchyard, but the school moved to Manchester Road in 1931. Leigh Girls&#x27; Grammar School was established in 1921, but both schools were abolished by the then Secretary of State for Education, Shirley Williams, in the 1976 Education Act. Leigh high schools include Bedford High School, and The Westleigh School. Pupils also attend schools in Atherton, Lowton, Golborne and Astley. Wigan and Leigh College provides post-16 education.

== Religion ==
St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church has been in existence since the 12th century and probably much earlier. It was once known as the Church of St Peter at Westleigh in Leigh, and straddles the boundary between the old townships of Westleigh and Pennington, the nave and churchyard, in Westleigh and the chancel in Pennington. Its early history is connected with the Westleigh and Urmston families. Its dedication changed to St Mary the Virgin in the 14th century. The church tower, said to have been built in 1516, is all that remains of the medieval structure, which was replaced by the present church after becoming unsafe. Paley and Austin of Lancaster designed the present church, the foundation stone was laid in 1871 and the church consecrated in 1873. The church is built in red sandstone it is a Grade II* listed building.

Parish churches have been built in each of the former townships. The first St Thomas&#x27;s Church in Bedford was consecrated in 1840 and replaced by the present church in 1909. It is built of Accrington red brick with Runcorn red sandstone facings, to designs by J. S. Crowther. Christ Church, Pennington, designed by architect E. H. Shellard, was built in Yorkshire stone and was consecrated in 1854. The site to the south of the canal was a rapidly growing area at this time. It is Grade II listed. Westleigh St Paul, founded in 1847 is on Westleigh Lane. Westleigh St Peter, a Grade II* listed building by Paley and Austin, built in brick with red sandstone dressings, was founded 1881 is on Firs Lane.

The first Catholic chapel was built in Bedford on the corner of Mather Lane and Chapel Street in 1778 and this lasted until it was replaced in 1855 by St Joseph&#x27;s Church by architect Joseph Hansom. A growing Catholic population in the area led to the building of Our Lady of the Rosary in Plank Lane in 1879, Twelve Apostles in 1879 and Sacred Heart in 1929. Other denominations catered for include Wesleyan, Independent, Primitive, Welsh and United Methodists. There are also Unitarian, Baptist and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness places of worship in the town.

== Sport ==

Leigh has a professional rugby league team – Leigh Leopards – whose main claim to fame is beating Hull KR 17-16 in the 2023 Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium for the third time. The club play in the Super League. Leigh has several amateur clubs, including Leigh East and Leigh Miners Rangers.

The town had a semi-professional football team, Leigh Genesis (formerly Leigh RMI), which ceased operations at a senior level in June 2011. The most successful amateur club is Leigh Athletic, which currently plays in the Manchester Football League.

Leigh also has an athletics club, Leigh Harriers AC, founded in 1909, and a Rugby Union club, Leigh RUFC, based at Round Ash Park, which gained promotion in 2007, to RFU league North 2 (West), and is current holder of the Lancashire Trophy which it won in May 2008 for the third consecutive year. Attached to the club is a crown green bowling section which runs several teams in local bowling leagues. Leigh has two cricket clubs: Leigh Cricket Club play in the ECB Premier League Liverpool Competition, and Westleigh Cricket Club, have two senior and 4 junior teams playing in the Greater Manchester Cricket League.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

The town is served by both BBC Radio Lancashire and BBC Radio Manchester. Other radio stations are Greatest Hits Radio Wigan &amp; St Helens, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire and Radio M29, a community based station.

Local newspaper is the &quot;Leigh Journal&quot; which publishes on Thursdays. It is also covered by the regional newspaper the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;.

== Culture ==
Many of Leigh&#x27;s old halls have been demolished but the sites of Lilford Park, once the grounds of Atherton Hall, a gift to Leigh from Lord Lilford in 1914 and Pennington Park, the grounds of Pennington Hall which was demolished in 1963 after being used as a museum, are open to the public.

Leigh&#x27;s wealth as an industrial town resulted in many outlets for the entertainment of its population, including theatres, cinemas and public houses. In 1908 the Hippodrome Theatre on Leigh Road was built on the site of Walker&#x27;s silk mill of 1827, this subsequently became a cinema, first the Odeon, later the Classic. Another theatre, the Theatre Royal, was built on Lord Street which later became the Leigh Casino Club. The Palace Cinema was built in 1913 on Railway Road and the assembly rooms above the Conservative Club, were converted to a cinema known as the Sems in 1908. Brewery Lane is a reminder that there was once a brewery in Bedford belonging to George Shaw &amp; Co.
The old Leigh College and Library on Railway Road was built between 1894 and 1896 by the Leigh Literary Society to designs by J. C. Prestwich and J. H. Stephen. The present library was built in 1971 between the parish church and town hall.

Leigh Hackspace was founded as a UK Community interest company in 2015

<text>Geoffroy de Breuil of Vigeois was a 12th-century chronicler, trained at the Benedictine abbey of Saint-Martial of Limoges, the site of a great early library.

==Life==
Geoffrey was born around 1140. He joined the abbey of St. Martial in Limoges as a monk in 1160, was ordained as a priest in 1168 after a brief period at La Souterraine, and became Prior (1178–1184) of the St. Martial dependency in Vigeois in 1178. It was at Vigeois that Geoffrey composed his &quot;Chroniques&quot; which trace in detail some great local families, often Geoffroy&#x27;s forebears and kin, while relating events happening from 994 to 1184: the fiery convulsive sickness, (actually ergotism from a fungus or ergot of wheat), the preparations for the First Crusade, reports of combats in the Holy Land, the spread of Cathar beliefs (writing in 1181, he was the first to use the term &quot;Albigensians&quot;), in all the while unconsciously revealing the preoccupations and manners of the times.

<text>WTVD (channel 11) is a television station licensed to Durham, North Carolina, United States, serving the Research Triangle area. Owned and operated by the ABC television network through its ABC Owned Television Stations division, it maintains studios on Liberty Street in downtown Durham, with news bureaus in Raleigh, Chapel Hill and Fayetteville. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located in Auburn, North Carolina. On-air branding uses ABC 11 as a station identifier, with the call sign taking a secondary role.

==History==
===Early years===
In 1952, two rival companies each applied for a construction permit to build a television station in Durham on the city&#x27;s newly allotted VHF channel 11—Herald-Sun Newspapers (publishers of the &quot;Durham Morning Herald&quot; and the &quot;Durham Sun&quot; as well as the owners of radio station WDNC) and Floyd Fletcher and Harmon Duncan, the then-owners of WTIK radio. In December 1953, the two sides agreed to join forces and operate the station under the joint banner Durham Broadcasting Enterprises. Originally christened with the call sign WTIK-TV, the station had to make a name change after the partners sold WTIK radio as a condition of the permit grant. Ownership chose WTVD and was granted the change, but they had to wait—the call sign had been used in the 1953 20th Century Fox film &quot;Taxi&quot; for a fictional television station appearing in the movie. At the time, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed unassigned call letters to be used in fictional works for an exclusive two-year period, making them unavailable for actual broadcast use.

Ten months after being granted its permit, on September 2, 1954, WTVD began broadcasting with a black-and-white film of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, followed by &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. It was originally a primary NBC affiliate, with secondary ABC and CBS affiliations. Channel 11 is the Triangle&#x27;s oldest surviving television station, having signed on a few months after CBS affiliate WNAO-TV (channel 28). The station&#x27;s initial studios were located in a former tuberculosis sanitorium at Broad Street in Durham, with a transmitter located atop Signal Hill in northern Durham County.

WRAL-TV (channel 5), based in Raleigh and locally owned by the Capitol Broadcasting Company, debuted in December 1956 and took over as the Triangle&#x27;s NBC affiliate, leaving channel 11 with only ABC. WNAO-TV ceased operations at the end of 1957 due to financial difficulties, and CBS moved its primary affiliation to WTVD. During the late 1950s, the station was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network.

On May 22, 1957, the station&#x27;s original owners sold their interest in WTVD to Albany, New York-based Hudson Valley Broadcasting Company, owners of WCDA-TV (now WTEN), to form Capital Cities Television Corporation (predecessor of Capital Cities Communications). Around 1958, WTVD built a tower at its present transmitter site in Auburn to increase its signal coverage for the entire Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville market; at the time this was the tallest man-made structure in the U.S. That same year, the station first began broadcasting network programs in color, although it would not be until 1966 before the same was true for local programming.

After WRAL-TV took the ABC affiliation full-time in 1962, WTVD was forced to shoehorn CBS and NBC programming onto its schedule. This was a very unusual arrangement for what was then a two-station market. The Triangle was, at least on paper, big enough even then to support three full network affiliates. However, the only other VHF license in the market, channel 4, had already been taken by National Educational Television outlet WUNC-TV. UHF TV broadcasting was not considered viable at the time. Not only were television manufacturers not required to include UHF tuning capability until 1964, with the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1961, but the available UHF frequencies were not thought to be nearly strong enough to cover a market that stretched from Chapel Hill in the west to Goldsboro in the east. This situation was similar to that of WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama. However, unlike WAPI-TV, WTVD managed to find room for &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, the &quot;CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

Although the market got a third commercial station six years later when a new channel 28 signed on as WRDU-TV (now WRDC), WTVD continued to &quot;cherry pick&quot; the most popular CBS and NBC programs for another three years, leaving WRDU with the lower-rated shows from both networks as well as NBC&#x27;s news programming. In 1971 the FCC, intervening on behalf of WRDU&#x27;s owners and in the interest of protecting the development of UHF, ordered WTVD to select one network. Channel 11 decided to go with CBS full-time, allowing WRDU to become an exclusive NBC station (it is now affiliated with MyNetworkTV).

In 1978, WTVD attempted to expand its broadcast coverage to the Fayetteville area, which had been without a television station of its own for nearly two decades. Its studios were relocated to their current location on Liberty Street in downtown Durham on a parcel of land it shares with the Durham County Library; it also built its current tower in Auburn. A fire on March 4, 1979, caused extensive damage to the newly built studio building; however, the newsroom and a number of other key components had been rebuilt within a month. By that time, much of WTVD&#x27;s operations had returned to normal, although it had resorted to temporary setups during the interim such as holding the newscasts in one of the meeting rooms that survived the fire unscathed.

===Switch to ABC===
On March 18, 1985, WTVD&#x27;s owner, Capital Cities, announced it was purchasing ABC. Five months later, on August 4, 1985, WTVD traded networks with WRAL-TV and became an ABC affiliate. At that time, WTVD and WRAL-TV joined the small list of stations in the country that have held primary affiliations with all of the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks. The transaction was finalized on January 3, 1986, making WTVD an ABC owned-and-operated station, the first network-owned television station in North Carolina. In 1996, The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC.

On the night of December 6, 1991, a helicopter carrying a pilot and three WTVD employees from a high school football game in Wilmington, North Carolina crashed when an engine bearing seized, killing three of the four people on board. Sports reporter Tony Debo, the only survivor, suffered a broken ankle; he was thrown free of the crash when his improperly installed seatbelt failed. The National Transportation Safety Board report published a year later cited the pilot&#x27;s decision to continue the flight despite a known engine problem.

On April 30, 2000, a dispute between Disney and Time Warner Cable forced WTVD off cable systems within the Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville market for over 24 hours during the May sweeps period. Other ABC stations in markets served by Time Warner Cable, such as New York City, Los Angeles and Houston, were also affected by the outage as well before the FCC forced TWC to restore service to those areas on May 2. In July 2010, Disney announced that it was involved in another carriage dispute with Time Warner Cable which involved four ABC owned-and-operated stations (including WTVD), Disney Channel and the networks of ESPN. If a deal was not in place, the entire Disney cluster would have been removed from Time Warner and Bright House cable systems across the country. On September 2, 2010, Disney and Time Warner Cable reached a long-term agreement to keep the Disney family of channels on its systems. On August 31, 2023, Disney removed all of its channels, including WTVD, two other ABC-owned stations, and the ESPN networks, from Spectrum cable systems due to a carriage dispute, its first with the provider since 2010 when its predecessor, Time Warner Cable, was involved in a dispute with Disney. On September 11, 2023, the stations and their sister cable channels were restored by Charter Communications (the parent company of Spectrum) after the company and Disney reached an agreement.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
WTVD airs select college football games from the North Carolina Tar Heels, the Duke Blue Devils and the NC State Wolfpack through &quot;ESPN College Football on ABC&quot;. As a then-CBS affiliate, WTVD aired the Wolfpack men&#x27;s basketball team&#x27;s upset of the Houston Cougars in the 1983 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball championship game. WTVD also aired select Carolina Hurricanes NHL games through the &quot;NHL on ABC&quot; from 2000 to 2004, and since 2021.

===News operation===
WTVD presently broadcasts 48 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, hours on Saturdays and six hours on Sundays); in regard to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output of any television station in the Research Triangle market. For most of the last four decades, WTVD has been a solid second in ratings across the market, behind WRAL. This is in contrast to most of its ABC stablemates (including sister stations WPVI-TV in Philadelphia and KFSN-TV in Fresno, California), which dominate their markets&#x27; news ratings. However, WTVD is still one of the strongest ABC stations in the country.
As with ABC&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations, WTVD features forecasts provided by AccuWeather for the weather segments of its newscasts. It operates its own weather radar, called &quot;First Alert Doppler XP&quot;, at its transmitter site in Auburn. WTVD has a fleet of regular news vans and trucks as well as a yellow Toyota FJ Cruiser which carries the name &quot;Breaking News One&quot;. WTVD also has a helicopter for newsgathering, which it refers to as &quot;Chopper 11 HD&quot;. WTVD has also begun to implement a drone for newsgathering, which it dubs as &quot;Drone 11&quot;.

Principal anchor Larry Stogner began working with station in 1976 and served as weeknight anchor from 1982 to 2015. On January 23, he announced his retirement after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; he died on October 3, 2016. His co-anchor for much of the 1980s and 1990s, Miriam Thomas, abruptly left WTVD after nineteen years in November 2001. Notable former members of WTVD&#x27;s news staff include musicians John Tesh and John D. Loudermilk, as well as former &quot;Good Morning America&quot; co-host David Hartman, ESPN personality Stuart Scott, and &quot;Nightline&quot; host Byron Pitts.

From 1973 to 1984, WTVD used the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; brand for its newscasts, though its format was very similar to the &quot;Action News&quot; format pioneered by sister station WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. The arrangement was similar to those used at WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York, and KFSN-TV. For a time, all three stations used the same theme song, &quot;Move Closer to Your World&quot;, and a nearly identical opening sequence. WRAL was also using the &quot;Action News&quot; brand during that time period. It called its newscasts simply &quot;WTVD 11 News&quot; from 1984 to 1993. WTVD called itself &quot;NewsChannel 11&quot; from 1993 to 2000, when it changed back to &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. WTVD was among the last stations to use the &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; &quot;Tar Sequence&quot; theme in its broadcasts (which was also used on WRAL for a period in the 1970s). However, the station debuted the theme soon after the Capital Cities/ABC merger and retired it in 1993. Like sister stations WABC-TV, KABC-TV, and KGO-TV, the theme was used only in the opens.

On June 26, 2006, WTVD debuted a new primetime newscast for WB (now CW) affiliate WLFL (channel 22) entitled &quot;Eyewitness News at 10 on WB 22&quot;. This happened after WLFL&#x27;s owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, ended the controversial &quot;News Central&quot; format on its stations and shut down WLFL&#x27;s established in-house news department. This newscast ran directly against the WRAL-produced 10 p.m. newscast on WRAZ (channel 50). On September 17, concurrent with WLFL&#x27;s affiliation switch to The CW, the newscast changed its name to reflect its new affiliation. On April 21, 2008, WTVD became the second television station in the Triangle behind WRAL and the eighth ABC-owned station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The primetime news on WLFL was included in the upgrade. WTVD debuted an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast on May 26, 2011, to fill the void left by &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, whose long run in that time slot came to an end a day earlier.

On June 27, 2022, it was announced on WLFL&#x27;s social media accounts that WTVD would no longer produce newscasts for WLFL and a full hour and a half of &quot;The National Desk&quot; will fill the 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. time slot on WLFL, leaving once again WRAZ as the only local station showing news at 10 pm.

On September 11, 2023, WTVD, along with sister stations WABC-TV and WPVI-TV, launched an additional hour-long newscast at 10 a.m. which took over the time slot previously occupied by &quot;Tamron Hall&quot;. The newscast is co-anchored by John Clark and Barbara Gibbs with meteorologist Kwielyn Murphy. The broadcast will continue to deliver news in a traditional format, and will also allow more focus to be placed on local newsmakers, and further discussion on topics addressed on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Live with Kelly and Mark&quot;.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Rich Brenner – sports anchor and reporter (deceased)
* Liz Horton – meteorologist
* Byron Pitts – journalist and host of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;
* Stuart Scott – later an anchor on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (deceased)
* John Tesh – later of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WTVD ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 11, at 12:30 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era VHF channel 11. On September 23, 2009, the station filed an application to the FCC to increase its effective radiated power from 20.7 to 45 kilowatts. Effective June 30, 2020, under the provisions of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation program, WTVD&#x27;s transmissions moved to channel 9, while continuing to display virtual channel 11.

==Out-of-market cable and satellite carriage==
In recent years, WTVD has been carried on cable in multiple areas outside of the Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville media market. That includes cable systems within the Greensboro, Greenville, Myrtle Beach, and Wilmington markets in North Carolina, and the Roanoke market in Virginia. On DirecTV, WTVD has been carried in Alamance County, which is within the Greensboro market.

In the 1970s and 1980s through CATV, WTVD was once carried as far east as Wilmington and as far west as Mount Airy. WTVD was also carried on cable in Brunswick County, Greenville, Williamston, Emporia, Virginia, and Bennettsville, South Carolina.

<doc id="450912" wikidata="Q1355893" url="?curid=450912" title="Oxalis tuberosa">
<text>Oxalis tuberosa is a perennial herbaceous plant that overwinters as underground stem tubers. These tubers are known as uqa in Quechua, oca in Spanish, yams in New Zealand and several other alternative names. The plant was brought into cultivation in the central and southern Andes for its tubers, which are used as a root vegetable. The plant is not known in the wild, but populations of wild &quot;Oxalis&quot; species that bear smaller tubers are known from four areas of the central Andean region. Oca was introduced to Europe in 1830 as a competitor to the potato, and to New Zealand as early as 1860.

In New Zealand, oca has become a popular table vegetable and is called yams (although not a true yam). It is available in various colors, including yellow, orange, pink, apricot, and traditional red.

==Cultural significance==
Grown primarily by Quechua and Aymara farmers, oca has been a staple of rural Andean diets for centuries. Of all Andean root and tuber crops, oca is currently second only to potato in area planted within the Central Andean region. Oca is essential to local food security because of its role in crop rotations and its high nutritional content.

==Diversity==

Andean farmers, including the indigenous Quechua and Aymara people, cultivate numerous varieties of oca. Oca diversity may be described with respect to morphological characters, local cultivar names, or molecular markers.

===Morphological characters===
Oca morphotypes are distinguished by foliar, floral, fruit, stem, and tuber characteristics, as described in the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute&#x27;s document on oca descriptors. The morphological diversity of oca tubers, in particular, is astounding. Tubers range from 25 to 150 mm in length by 25 mm in width; skin and flesh color may be white, cream, yellow, orange, pink, red, and/or purple and distributed in range of patterns.
===Local cultivar names===
Oca-growing communities often name varieties based primarily on tuber morphology and secondarily on flavor. For example, common names may include ushpa negra (black ash) or puka panti (red &quot;Cosmos&quot; &quot;peucedanifolius&quot;). Great inconsistency of nomenclature has been reported within and among communities.
===Molecular markers===
Numerous studies have additionally described oca diversity through molecular approaches to study protein and genetic variation. Molecular markers, such as allozymes (e.g., del Río, 1999) and inter-simple sequence repeats (e.g., Pissard et al., 2006), show oca diversity to be low relative to other crops, probably because of its vegetative mode of propagation. While genetic differentiation corresponds well with folk classification, cluster analyses indicate that folk cultivars are not perfect clones, but rather genetically heterogeneous groupings.

==Edibility==
Oca is cultivated primarily for its edible stem tuber, but the leaves and young shoots can also be eaten as a green vegetable. Mature stems can be used similarly to rhubarb. Andean communities have various methods to process and prepare tubers, and in Mexico oca is eaten raw with salt, lemon, and hot pepper. The flavor is often slightly tangy, but there is a considerable degree of flavor difference between varieties, and some are not acidic. Texture ranges from crunchy (like a carrot) when raw or undercooked, to starchy or mealy when fully cooked.

===Use categories===
Oca is fairly high in oxalates, concentrated in the skin. Significant variation in oxalate concentration exists among varieties, and this variation distinguishes two oca use-categories recognized by Andean farmers.

One use category, sour oca, contains cultivars with high oxalic acid levels. Farmers process these tubers to form a usable storage product called &quot;khaya&quot; in Quechua. tubers are first soaked in water for approximately one month to prepare khaya. Then they are left outside during hot, sunny days and cold, freezing nights until they become completely dehydrated. This process is similar to the preparation of &quot;chuñu&quot; from bitter potatoes. Cultivars in this use category are referred to in Quechua as &quot;khaya&quot; (name of the dried, processed product) or &quot;p&#x27;usqu&quot; (sour/fermented), and in Aymara as &quot;luk’i&quot;.

The other use category, sweet oca, contains cultivars with lower oxalic acid levels. The traditional Andean preparation methods for this use category are also geared towards reducing the oxalate level of the harvested vegetable, but without dehydration. This is done by exposure to sunlight, which decreases the organic acid content and increases the oca&#x27;s sweet taste.
Once exposed to sunlight, oca can be boiled, baked, or fried. In the Andes it is used in stews and soups, served like potatoes, or can be served as a sweet. Cultivars in this category are referred to in Quechua as &quot;wayk&#x27;u&quot; (boiling), &quot;misk&#x27;i&quot; (sweet/delicious) and in Aymara as &quot;q&#x27;ini&quot;.

Sour oca and sweet oca form distinct genetic clusters based on AFLP data. This suggests the possibility of distinct evolutionary histories for each use-category.

=== Nutrition ===
Oca is a source of carbohydrates, dietary minerals, and protein. Cultivars vary substantially in nutritional content.

==Cultivation==

Oca is one of the important staple crops of the Andean highlands due to its easy propagation and tolerance for poor soil, high altitude, and harsh climates.

===Distribution===
Oca is planted in the Andean region from Venezuela to Argentina, from 2800 to 4100 meters above sea level. Its highest abundance and most extraordinary diversity are in central Peru and northern Bolivia, the probable area of its domestication.

===Climate requirements===
Oca needs a long growing season and is day length dependent, forming tubers when the day length shortens in autumn (around March in the Andes). In addition, oca requires climates with average temperatures of approximately 10 to 12 °C (ranging between 4 and 17 °C) and average precipitation of 700 to 885 millimeters per year.

Oca requires short days to form tubers. Outside the tropics, it will not begin to form tubers until approximately the autumn equinox. The plant will die before producing tubers if frosts occur too soon after the autumn equinox.

===Soil requirements===
Oca grows with very low production inputs, generally on plots of marginal soil quality, and tolerates acidities between about pH 5.3 and 7.8. In traditional Andean cropping systems, it is often planted after potato and therefore benefits from persisting nutrients applied to, or leftover from, the potato crop.

===Propagation===
Oca is usually propagated vegetatively by planting whole tubers.

Propagation by seed is possible but is rarely used in practice. Sexual propagation is complicated by several factors. First, like many other species in the genus &quot;Oxalis&quot;, oca flowers exhibit tristylous heterostyly and are consequently subject to auto-incompatibility. Furthermore, on the rare occasion that oca plants do produce fruit, their loculicidal capsules dehisce spontaneously, making it difficult to harvest seed. Oca flowers are pollinated by insects (e.g., genera &quot;Apis&quot;, &quot;Megachile&quot;, and &quot;Bombus&quot;).

===Cropping factors===
Oca tuber seeds are planted in the Andes in August or September and harvested from April to June. The first flowers bloom around three to four months after planting, and the tubers also begin to form. Between planting and harvesting, the oca crop requires little tending, except for a couple of weedings and hillings. 
Oca is a component of traditional crop rotations and is usually planted in a field directly after the potato harvest. A standard sequence in this rotation system may be one year of potato, one year of oca, one year of oats or faba beans, and two to four years fallow. Within this system, q’allpa is a Quechua term that signifies soil previously cultivated and prepared for the planting of a new crop.

The cultural practice is similar to potatoes. Planting is done in rows or hills 80–100 cm apart, with plants spaced 40–60 cm apart in the rows. Monoculture predominates, but interplanting with several other tuber species, including mashua and olluco, in one field is common in Andean production. Often, this intercropping consists of several different varieties of each species. Such mixed fields may later be sorted into tuber types during harvest or before cooking.

===Yields===
Yields vary with the cultural method. Annals from Andean countries report about 7-10 tonnes per hectare of &quot;O. tuberosa&quot; production. However, with adequate inputs and virus-free propagation material, oca production can range from 35 to 55 tonnes per hectare.

===Limitations===
Pests and diseases limit the production of oca. Crops in the Andes are often infected with viruses, causing chronic yield depression. Adequate techniques to remove viruses have to be applied before the varieties can be used outside the Andean region. Cultivation is also constrained by the Andean potato weevil (&quot;Premnotrypes spp&quot;), ulluco weevil (&quot;Cylydrorhinus spp&quot;), and oca weevil, the identification of which remains uncertain (possibly &quot;Adioristidius&quot;, &quot;Mycrotrypes&quot;, or &quot;Premnotrypes&quot;). These weevils often destroy entire crops. Further notable pests are nematodes.

As already mentioned, both day-length restrictions and the presence of oxalates can also be considered limiting factors. Scientists work with specific breeding, selection, and virus-cleaning programs for these purposes.

==Conservation efforts==
Several ongoing ex situ and in situ conservation projects currently focus on the preservation of &quot;O. tuberosa&quot; diversity. The International Potato Center (CIP) in Peru has several hundred accessions of oca collected from regions in Bolivia, Argentina, and Peru to help ensure and maintain diversity. There are further efforts to collect accession of oca in regions where habitat destruction and pests threaten the diversity of wild oca accessions.

<doc id="450913" wikidata="Q1018723" url="?curid=450913" title="Coatbridge">
<text>Coatbridge (, ) is a town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland, about east of Glasgow city centre, set in the central Lowlands. Along with neighbouring town Airdrie, Coatbridge forms the area known as the Monklands (population approximately 90,000 including outlying settlements), often considered to be part of the Greater Glasgow urban area – although officially they have not been included in population figures since 2016 due to small gaps between the Monklands and Glasgow built-up areas.

In the last years of the 18th century, the area developed from a loose collection of hamlets into the town of Coatbridge. The town&#x27;s development and growth have been intimately connected with the technological advances of the Industrial Revolution, and in particular with the hot blast process. Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and was then described as &#x27;the industrial heartland of Scotland&#x27; and the &#x27;Iron Burgh&#x27;.

Coatbridge also had a notorious reputation for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry. However, by the 1920s, coal seams were exhausted and the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline. After the Great Depression, the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge &quot;coal, iron and steel have all been consigned to the heritage scrap heap&quot;.

==History==

Coatbridge owes its name to a bridge that carried the old Edinburgh-Glasgow road over the Gartsherrie Burn, at what is now Coatbridge Cross. This first appears on Roy&#x27;s survey of 1755 as &quot;Cottbrig&quot;, one of a number of places on the wider Coats estate. The name Coats most likely comes from the Scots word &quot;cot(t)&quot;, meaning &quot;cottage&quot;, although an alternative theory links it to the name of the Colt family, who owned land here as early as the 13th century.

===Early history: from Bronze Age to Middle Ages===
Settlement of the Coatbridge area dates back 3000 years to the Mesolithic Age. A circle of Bronze Age stone coffins was found on the Drumpellier estate in 1852. A number of other Bronze Age urns and relics have been found in Coatbridge. An Iron Age wood and thatch crannog dwelling was sited in the loch at the present day Drumpellier Country Park. Dependent upon the water level in the loch, the remains can still be seen.

Roman coins have been unearthed in Coatbridge, and there are the remains of a Roman road on the fringes of the town near the M8 motorway.

===Middle Ages to late 18th century===
The Monklands area inherited its name after the area was granted to the Cistercian monks of Newbattle Abbey by King Malcolm IV in 1162. In 1323, the Monklands name appeared for the first time on Stewards&#x27; charter. The monks mined coal and farmed the land until the time of the reformation when the land was taken from them and given to private landowners. In 1641, the parish of Monklands was divided between New Monkland (present day Airdrie) and Old Monkland (present day Coatbridge). Old Monkland was described in the 1799 Statistical Account as an &quot;immense garden&quot; with &quot;extensive orchards&quot; and &quot;luxurious crops&quot;, where &quot;rivers abound with salmon&quot;.

===19th century===
The Monkland Canal was constructed at the end of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the hot blast furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge&#x27;s ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two-thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.

The prosperous industry which had sprung up around the new iron industry required vast numbers of largely unskilled workers to mine ironstone and work in the blast furnace plants. Coatbridge therefore became a popular destination for vast numbers of Irish (especially from County Donegal in Ulster) arriving in Scotland. The iron bars and plates produced in Coatbridge iron works were the raw materials needed throughout the British Empire for railways, construction, bridge building and shipbuilding. One example of uses Coatbridge iron was put to included armour plating for British ships fighting in the Crimean War.

Over the course of the following forty years, the population of Coatbridge grew by 600%. The character of the Coatbridge area changed from a rural, Presbyterian landscape of small hamlets and farmhouses into a crowded, polluted, Irish Catholic industrial town. In 1840, Rev William Park wrote that:

One contemporary observer at this time noted that Coatbridge is &quot;not famous for its sylvan beauties of its charming scenery&quot; and &quot;offers the visitor no inducements to loiter long&quot;. However, &quot;a visit to the large Gartsherrie works is one of the sights of a lifetime&quot;.

Most of the town&#x27;s population lived in tight rows of terraced houses built under the shadow of the iron works. These homes were often owned by their employers. Living conditions for most were appalling and tuberculosis was rife.

For a fortunate few though, fortunes could be won &quot;with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains of some of the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru&quot;, noted one observer. Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new hot blast process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Bairds subsequently constructed numerous iron foundries in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The waste heap or &#x27;bing&#x27; from the Baird&#x27;s Gartsherrie works was said to be as large as the great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting 16 blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. Each of the six sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.

The town was vividly described by Robert Baird in 1845:

 In the 19th century, the Baird family wielded a pervasive influence over Coatbridge. They were responsible for the design of the lay out of present-day Coatbridge town centre. The land for the Town Hall and the land which later came to form Dunbeth Park was given to the town by the Bairds. Gartsherrie church was built by the Baird family, the oldest and most significant landmark in the town. Despite being Protestant, the Bairds donated the site on the Main Street for the erection of St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church.
Daniel (Dane) Sinclair, an engineer with the National Telephone Company, based in Glasgow, patented the automatic telephone switchboard. This system was installed in Coatbridge in 1886 and became the world&#x27;s first automatic telephone exchange.

===20th/21st centuries===
By 1885, the once plentiful Monklands ironstone deposits had been largely exhausted. It became increasingly expensive to produce iron in Coatbridge as raw materials had to be imported from as far afield as Spain. The growth of the steel industry (in nearby Motherwell) had also led to a start of a decline in demand for the pig iron Coatbridge produced. Living conditions remained grim. In the 1920s, Lloyd George&#x27;s &quot;Coal and Power&quot; report described the living conditions in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge: 

George Orwell&#x27;s book &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier&quot; was illustrated by a photograph of homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934, there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This had the effect of a hammer blow impact on the town&#x27;s iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of &#x27;devastating&#x27; unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936, Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.

In the 1930s and 1950s, however, massive state-sponsored programmes saw thousands of new homes built in Coatbridge and some of the worst examples of slum housing were cleared away. By the early 1980s, 85% of homes in Coatbridge were part of local authority housing stock.

The last of the blast furnaces, William Baird&#x27;s famous Gartsherrie works, closed in 1967.

Since the 1970s, there have been various initiatives to attempt to regenerate Coatbridge. Urban Aid grants, European Union grants and, more recently, Social Inclusion Partnerships have attempted to breathe new life into Coatbridge. Despite these efforts the town&#x27;s population has continued to fall and, in recent years, the town has been dubbed the &quot;most dismal in Scotland&quot;.

==Geography==
At (55.861°, -4.047°), Coatbridge is situated in Scotland&#x27;s Central Lowlands. The town lies above sea level, east of Glasgow, south of Cumbernauld and west of Airdrie.
Although Coatbridge has no major river running through it, the North Calder Water runs east–west to the south and the now defunct Monkland Canal used to run straight through the centre of the town toward Glasgow. The canal route through Coatbridge can still be seen today. Several smaller burns run through Coatbridge, most of which drain into the North Calder Water. Coatbridge has four significant public parks: Dunbeth Park, West End Park, Whifflet park and Drumpellier Country Park. Lochend Loch (locally known as Drumpellier Loch) and Woodend Loch are situated on the north-west edge of Coatbridge.

===Topography===
The topography of Coatbridge was an important feature in the town&#x27;s development during the industrial revolution. Coatbridge rests 60 metres below the &quot;Slamannan plateau&quot; and neighbouring Airdrie sits on its edge. The low-lying flat ground of Coatbridge was a vital factor in the siting of the town&#x27;s blast furnaces and the Monkland Canal route. Although Airdrie was an already established town and had local supplies of ironstone, the Monkland Canal link did not extend into Airdrie because of its higher elevation. The Clyde Valley plan of 1949 described Coatbridge as &#x27;situated over a flooded coalfield&#x27;. Tenement buildings in Coatbridge were not built to the same level as Glasgow tenements due to danger of local subsidence from centuries of local mining.

===Geology===
Dunbeth Hill where the present local authority municipal buildings stand is a wedge of rock which was probably squeezed upwards by the force of two (now-extinct) fault lines. There are the remains of spreads of glacial sands along the crest of Drumpellier, the west bank of Gartsherrie Burn and along modern day Bank Street. Kirkwood, Kirkshaws and Shawhead sit on a sandstone capped ridge looking south over the Clyde Valley. The vital Coatbridge black band coal field extended from Langloan to beyond the eastern edge of the town.

===Climate===
Like much of the British Isles, Coatbridge experiences a temperate maritime climate with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The prevailing wind is from the west. Regular but generally light precipitation occurs throughout the year.

=== Culture ===
Coatbridge is the home of one of Scotland&#x27;s most visited museums, Summerlee Museum of Scottish Industrial Life, which contains an insight into the lives of working people in the West of Scotland. A miners&#x27; row of 1900s–1980s houses, a working tramway and a reconstruction coal mine can all be experienced on site. The museum is situated on the remains of one of Coatbridge&#x27;s historic blast furnaces, now a Scheduled Monument.

===Literature, Theatre and Film===
Janet Hamilton, the nineteenth century poet and essayist, died in Langloan in 1873. Present-day writers Anne Donovan (Orange prize winner), Brian Conaghan (the award-winning author of several novels) Award-winning author Des Dillon are all from Coatbridge. Coatbridge has regularly featured in Des Dillon&#x27;s work. Two of his books about Coatbridge have been turned into plays.

Mark Millar is a Coatbridge comic book writer whose &quot;Wanted&quot; comic book series has been translated into a feature film starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman, as well as the highly successful graphic novel Kickass which was adapted into the successful film of the same name in 2010. Coatbridge-born Dame Laurentia McLachlan was the Benedictine abbess of the Stanbrook Community whose correspondence with George Bernard Shaw and Sydney Cockerell was the subject of the film &quot;The Best of Friends&quot;.

Coatbridge is also home to the annual Deep Fried Film Festival. Local filmmakers Duncan and Wilma Finnigan have been described by &quot;The List&quot; as &quot;the John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands of Coatbridge&quot;.

===Music===
Thomas McAleese (alias Dean Ford) was the lead singer of The Marmalade who had a UK number one single in 1969 with a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot; and co-wrote &quot;Reflections of My Life&quot;, Marmalade&#x27;s biggest worldwide success. Coatbridge brothers Greg Kane and Pat Kane are the band Hue and Cry. Coatbridge born Alan Frew is the ex-pat lead singer of Canadian group Glass Tiger. &quot;My Town&quot; was written by Glass Tiger bandmates Alan Frew, Alan Connelly and Wayne Parker, as well as Jim Cregan, who co-wrote two of Rod Stewart&#x27;s other hits. The song&#x27;s lyrics are a tribute to Frew&#x27;s hometown, Coatbridge, and Stewart was invited to record the song with Glass Tiger because of his Scottish ancestry. Cha Burns (deceased), Jimme O&#x27;Neill and JJ Gilmour of The Silencers are from Coatbridge. Coatbridge sisters Fran and Anna were a famous duo on the Scottish traditional music scene. Cousins Ted and Hugh McKenna, of Tear Gas and the Sensational Alex Harvey Band, and Hugh&#x27;s sister, Mae McKenna, a folk singer and renowned session singer, came from the Kirkshaws area of Coatbridge.

===Coatbridge and Ireland===

Coatbridge is especially noted for its historical links with Ireland. This is largely due to large scale immigration into the town from Ulster (especially from County Donegal) in the 19th century and throughout most of the 20th century. Indeed, the town has been called &quot;little Ireland&quot;.

The most obvious manifestation of these links can be seen in the annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day Festival. The festival is sponsored by the Irish Government and Guinness. The festival runs for over a fortnight and includes lectures, film shows, dance/Gaelic football competitions and music performances. The festival is the largest Irish celebration in Scotland.

===Coatbridge accent===
The Coatbridge accent has been categorised as making less use of the Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the &quot;a&quot; vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen in the pronunciation of the words stair (&quot;sterr&quot;), hair (&quot;herr&quot;), fair (&quot;ferr&quot;) and chair (&quot;cherr&quot;). This different enunciation has been attributed to the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge accent and pronunciation has diminished as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.

==Sports==
Coatbridge&#x27;s local football team is Albion Rovers. Albion Rovers play in the Lowland Football League having been relegated from Scottish League Two following the 2022–23 season. Cliftonhill is where they play their home games. The &quot;Wee Rovers&quot; were founded in 1882 when two local Coatbridge clubs, Rovers and Albion, amalgamated to form the club bearing the name.

Coatbridge CC a local amateur football club founded in 1976 became Scottish Champions in 1986 and again in 1988. Coatbridge CC became the first amateur football club to win the Scottish Cup and the West of Scotland cup in the same season.

Coatbridge Bowling Club (founded 1849) celebrates its 175th anniversary in 2024 and is the oldest sports club in the town. It is situated in Bowling Street, in the Blairhill area of Coatbridge.

The Coatbridge Indoor bowling club hosted the World Indoor Bowls Championships from 1979 until 1987.

Drumpellier Cricket Club has been in continuous existence for over 150 years and the club has a ground in the Drumpellier area.

Greyhound and speedway racing also took part in the town, using the Albion Rovers FC ground. Greyhound Racing began on 11 December 1931 and lasted until 1986. The Edinburgh Monarchs rode there in 1968–69 (as the Coatbridge Monarchs) after losing their track at Meadowbank Stadium to the developers for the 1970 Commonwealth Games. Glasgow Tigers moved from Hampden Park to Coatbridge in 1973, and stayed there until June 1977, when they were forced out by the greyhound racing.

Coatbridge was the home of former boxer Bert Gilroy, Scotland&#x27;s longest-reigning champion. Coatbridge is also home to the former WBO Super-featherweight, lightweight and light-welterweight world champion Ricky Burns. Walter Donaldson, former World Snooker champion, also hailed from Coatbridge.

There are two golf courses: the municipal course bordering Drumpellier Country Park and the nearby private member&#x27;s club Drumpellier Golf Course. Clare Queen, Scotland&#x27;s number one female golfer on the women&#x27;s European tour, is from Coatbridge.

Coatbridge has a sumo club, Clan Sumo.

==Coat of Arms==

Coatbridge was given burgh status in 1885, and was granted a coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to represent a blast furnace and Coatbridge&#x27;s industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and the legend of the &quot;aul&#x27; kirk stane&quot;. The legend of the &quot;aul&#x27; kirk stane&quot; is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone down. It was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present-day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the alleged stone can still be seen.

The Latin motto &quot;Laborare est orare&quot; translates as &quot;to work is to pray&quot;, which originated in the writings of St Benedict and is commonly associated with the Cistercian Order, whose monks came to Monklands in the 12th century.

==Local Government==

Coatbridge is represented by three tiers of elected government. North Lanarkshire Council, the unitary local authority for Coatbridge, is based at Motherwell, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Up until 1975, Coatbridge had its own Burgh Council based at Coatbridge Town Hall. Between 1975 and 1996, Coatbridge was part of Monklands District Council and Strathclyde Regional Council. During the campaign for the 1994 by-election in Monklands East of 1994, there were accusations of sectarianism and nepotism in favour of Coatbridge over neighbouring Airdrie by Monklands District Council (see Monklandsgate for more information). The fact that all seventeen Labour councillors were Roman Catholic led to Coatbridge being seen as a &quot;Catholic town&quot;. Subsequent inquiries showed no evidence of sectarianism, but allegations of nepotism were shown to be true.

Coatbridge is presently part of the burgh constituency of Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill, electing one member of parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Before the constituency&#x27;s creation in 2005, Coatbridge lay in the Coatbridge and Chryston constituency. Steven Bonnar of the Scottish National Party has been the MP since the 2019 general election. For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, Coatbridge forms part of the Coatbridge and Cryston constituency, which is represented by Fulton MacGregor of the Scottish National Party. Coatbridge is further represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region. A small part of the eastern fringes of the town forms part of the Airdrie and Shotts constituency which is represented by Alex Neil in the Scottish Parliament and Neil Gray in the Westminster Parliament, both of the SNP.

Notable politicians from Coatbridge include: Baroness Liddell, a former member of parliament (MP) who was formerly both Secretary of State for Scotland and Britain&#x27;s High Commissioner in Australia, and Lord Reid, also a former MP who was the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Home Secretary. Lord Reid is a former chairman of Celtic.

===Wards===
Since the most recent major reorganisation in 2006, Coatbridge is divided into three wards for local administrative purposes by North Lanarkshire Council, each electing three or four councillors:

*Coatbridge North (2019 population 15,146): Townhead, Greenhill, Sunnyside, Dunbeth, Blairhill, Drumpellier, Clinftonville, town centre
*Coatbridge South (2019 population 16,889): Greenend, Sikeside, Whifflet, Kirkshaws, Shawhead and Carnbroe
*Coatbridge West (2019 population 14,910): Kirkwood, Dundyvan, Langloan, Old Monkland, Barrowfield plus Bargeddie

==Demography==
According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the census locality of Coatbridge had a total resident population of 41,170, or 13% of the total of North Lanarkshire. This figure, combined with an area of , provides Coatbridge with a population density figure of .

The median ages of males and females living in Coatbridge were 35 and 38 years respectively, compared to 37 and 39 years in the whole of Scotland. 34% were married, 6.1% were cohabiting couples, 14.7% were single parent families and 32.5% of households were made up of individuals.

The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents was as follows: 98.7% United Kingdom (including 96% from Scotland), 0.32% Republic of Ireland, 0.30% from other European Union countries, and 0.72% from elsewhere in the world. The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 39.3% in full-time employment, 9.4% in part-time employment, 3.6% self-employed, 5.3% unemployed, 2.5% students with jobs, 3.2% students without jobs, 13.4% retired, 5.7% looking after home or family, 12.0% permanently sick or disabled, and 5.7% economically inactive for other reasons. Compared with the average demographics of Scotland, Coatbridge has low proportions of people born outside the United Kingdom, and people over 75 years of age.

During the 19th century, Irish people began to arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge. The 1851 UK Census recorded that Irish people constituted 35.8% of the local population. A significant proportion of these immigrants were Protestant, but the majority were Catholic. By 1901 UK Census, the percentage of Irish-born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland. In the 2001 UK Census, Irish ethnicity was recorded at just over 1%, although just over half the population claimed their religious denomination as Roman Catholicism. In 1985, 56% of the population of Coatbridge were Roman Catholic.

In 2006, Coatbridge (along with Port Glasgow and Clydebank) was identified as &quot;the least Scottish town in Scotland&quot; due to having the highest percentage of Irish names in the country. Reportedly more than 28% of adults in Coatbridge had names with Irish origins.

Other immigrants to Coatbridge have included in the 1880s a small number of Lithuanians. In 1905, part of a &quot;wave&quot; of immigrants from Monte Cassino in Italy settled in Coatbridge. A small number of Polish people had stayed in Coatbridge after a Polish tank regiment was stationed in the town during World War II.

==Economy==
21st century Coatbridge is the site of Scotland&#x27;s inland container base; it was chosen as the site in part due to the proximity of various rail and motorway networks. Makers of PA systems and loudspeakers Tannoy Ltd. are headquartered in the town. Lees of Scotland is a local confectionery and bakery products company and are the manufacturers of the Lees Macaroon bar, and has been operating in Coatbridge since 1931. William Lawson&#x27;s Scotch Whisky distillery has been located in the town since 1967. It was home to one of the first B&amp;Q Depots, which was closed in 2006 and moved to the new retail park. The oldest family business in Coatbridge and Airdrie is funeral directors Donald McLaren Ltd, which was founded in 1912.

In terms of housing, property prices in Coatbridge have undergone rapid growth since 2000. In 2005, house prices rose by 35%, reportedly the largest such increase in Scotland. 

==Landmarks==

The built environment around Coatbridge&#x27;s town centre is a mixture of late 19th- and early 20th-century sandstone buildings and late 20th-century precast concrete shops. The leafy Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation areas to the west and north of the town centre comprise detached, semi-detached and terraced sandstone residential buildings. The bulk of the remaining surrounding areas consist of various 20th-century local authority housing buildings. Several high-rise flats dominate the skyline. Due to the decline of industries, several private housing estates have been built on reclaimed land.

In 2007, Coatbridge was awarded &quot;Prospect&quot; architecture magazine&#x27;s carbuncle award for being the &#x27;most dismal town in Scotland&#x27;. The town was also described by Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle as &#x27;like Bladerunner... without the special effects&#x27;.

Drumpellier Country Park is set around Lochend Loch (more commonly known to locals as &#x27;Drumpellier Loch&#x27;). There are extensive woodlands, a visitor centre and a butterfly house. Monkland Canal runs through a section of the park.

The Time Capsule is a multi-purpose leisure centre containing a swimming pool, an adventure pool set in a prehistoric environment, an ice skating facility, sauna/steam room and a sports complex with gym halls and other facilities. The Showcase Leisure Park contains a 14-screen cinema, a 10-pin bowling complex and numerous restaurants.

Landmarks in Coatbridge include:
* Coatbridge Leisure Centre – Peter Womersley 1970s brutalist, modernist cantilevered building sited on the main road into Coatbridge

==Transport==
The Monkland Canal (completed 1791) was used in the 19th and 20th century to transport coal and iron to Glasgow. The town centre section of the canal was interred in pipe between Sikeside and Blair Road in the mid-1970s. Some sections of the Monkland Canal can still be seen today between Townhead and Drumpellier. Coatbridge is adjacent to the M8 and M73 motorways. The M74 motorway is also a short drive away. The major cities of Edinburgh, Stirling and Glasgow are all within commuting distance.
Due to the number of rail lines running through Coatbridge, it was once dubbed the &quot;Crewe of the North&quot;. There are six railway stations on the four railway lines that bisect the town: Motherwell-Cumbernauld Line; Argyle Line; Whifflet Line; and North Clyde Line. The six stations within Coatbridge and on these lines are: ; ; ; ; ; and .

Coatbridge has had additional passenger stations, such as and Calder Station (Greenend); these stations have been closed for many years.

McGill&#x27;s Buses are responsible for most of the bus services in the town, after buying out most of the smaller local companies. The buses are all in Go Zone 8 on the McGill&#x27;s network. The buses link all the major neighbourhoods with the 212 continuing on to Airdrie, Plains and Caldercruix.

==Neighbourhoods==
The earliest map showing Coatbridge is by Timothy Pont, published in Johan Blaeu&#x27;s &quot;Nether warde of Clyds-dail&quot; (1654). The districts of Dunpelder (Drumpellier), Gartsbary (Gartsherrie), Kanglon (Langloan), Kirkwood, Kirkshawes (Kirkshaws) and Wheetflet (Whifflet) are all evident.

The present day neighbourhoods of Coatbridge are Barrowfield, Blairhill, Brownshill, Carnbroe, Cliftonhill, Cliftonville, Coatbank, Coatdyke, Cuparhead, Drumpellier, Dunbeth, Dundyvan, Espieside, Gartsherrie, Greenhill, Greenend, Kirkshaws, Kirkwood, Langloan, Old Monkland, Rosehall, Shawhead, Sikeside, Summerlee, Sunnyside, Townhead and Whifflet. The Blairhill and Dunbeth neighbourhoods are part of the &quot;Blairhill and Dunbeth conservation area&quot;.

The Whitelaw Fountain (named in honour of Alexander Whitelaw, an industrialist and MP) is situated in the town centre on the corner of Main Street and South Circular Road, but was formerly about 50 m west, at what is now the centre of a roundabout.

==Education==
Coatbridge College was built as Scotland&#x27;s first college in the 1860s. As Coatbridge has moved away from the traditional heavy industries the teaching focus has shifted from traditional industry courses towards commerce, care and the arts. After resisting previous mergers, it became a campus of the multi-site New College Lanarkshire in 2014.

St Ambrose High School (which opened a new building in 2013), St Andrew&#x27;s High School (which opened in 2006 following a merger of the defunct Columba H.S. and St Patrick&#x27;s H.S.) and Coatbridge High School (new building opened in 2008 on the site of St Patrick&#x27;s previous campus – Coatbridge&#x27;s old campus is now occupied by Greenhill Primary and Drumpark Primary) are the main secondary schools serving the town. The first two are Roman Catholic; it is one of few places in Scotland where the number of denominational schools is greater than non-denominational. St Ambrose was the subject of an HMI follow-up assessment visit in January 2009. Sports journalist and broadcaster Bob Crampsey was formerly headmaster of St Ambrose, prominent football referee Willie Collum taught religious education at the school in the early 2000s, and singer/television presenter Michelle McManus is among the former pupils. Rosehall H.S. was a previous school in the town, whose pupils now typically attend Coatbridge.
Coatbridge also has several special needs schools including Pentland School (primary school), Portland High School, Drumpark School (now primary department only), Willowbank School (high school) and Buchanan High School.

==Public services==
Coatbridge forms part of the Western water and sewerage regions of Scotland. Waste management is provided by the North Lanarkshire local authority. Water supplies are provided by Scottish Water, a government-owned corporation of the Scottish Government. Coatbridge&#x27;s distribution network operator for electricity is Scottish Power. Coatbridge is served by Monklands Hospital, sited on the Airdrie side of the Coatbridge/Airdrie border. The NHS board is NHS Lanarkshire. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is the statutory fire and rescue service which operates in Coatbridge. Policing in Coatbridge is provided by the Police Service of Scotland (Lanarkshire Division). The Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, a public body in Scotland, has direct operational responsibilities, such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services, and managing integrated ticketing in Coatbridge and other areas from the former Strathclyde region.

<text>The Tyne Bridge is a through arch bridge over the River Tyne in North East England, linking Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. The bridge was designed by the engineering firm Mott, Hay and Anderson, who later designed the Forth Road Bridge, and was built by Dorman Long and Co. of Middlesbrough. The bridge was officially opened on 10 October 1928 by King George V and has since become a defining symbol of Tyneside. It is ranked as the tenth tallest structure in Newcastle.

==History of construction==

The earliest bridge across the Tyne, Pons Aelius, was built by the Romans on the site of the present Swing Bridge around 122.

A series of wooden bridges were lost to fire or flood, and plans for a stone bridge were begun in about 1250 with support from local landowners, and the Bishops of Durham, York and Caithness. The stone bridge was constructed but then damaged by flood in 1339. Repairs proved costly and took place in sections: it was not fully repaired, as a part stone and part wooden bridge, until the 16th century and was part destroyed by a great flood in November 1771.
Following this, a new stone bridge was begun after the city council petitioned Parliament. The foundation stone on the north side was laid by Sir Matthew White Ridley on 25 April 1775, with the south side foundation stone laid in 1776. Works were completed by 13 September 1779, at an estimated cost of between £30,000 and £60,000.

Work on a modern bridge started in August 1925, with Dorman Long acting as the building contractors. Despite the dangers of the building work, only one worker, Nathaniel Collins, a father of four and a local scaffolder from South Shields, died in the building of this structure.

The Tyne Bridge was designed by Mott, Hay and Anderson, comparable to their Sydney Harbour Bridge version. These bridges derived their design from the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. The Dorman Long team was also notable for including Dorothy Buchanan, the first female member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, joining in 1927; in addition to her contribution to the Tyne Bridge, she served as part of the team for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Lambeth Bridge in London.

The bridge was completed on 25 February 1928, and officially opened on 10 October that year by King George V and Queen Mary, who were the first to use the roadway, travelling in their Ascot Landau. The opening ceremony was attended by 20,000 schoolchildren who had been given the day off. &quot;Movietone News&quot; recorded the speech given by the King.

The Tyne Bridge&#x27;s towers were built of Cornish granite and were designed by local architect Robert Burns Dick as warehouses with five storeys. But, the inner floors of the warehouses in the bridge&#x27;s towers were not completed and, as a result, the storage areas were never used. A lift for passengers and goods was built in the North tower to provide access to the Quayside; it is no longer in use. Although a lift shaft was also included in the South tower no lift was ever installed.

The bridge&#x27;s design uses a parabolic arch.

The bridge was originally painted green with special paint made by J. Dampney, Tonbridge, Tingate Co. of Gateshead. The same colours were used to paint the bridge in 2000.

==Technical information==
==History==
In 2012, the largest Olympic rings in the UK were erected on the bridge. The rings were manufactured by commercial signage specialists Signmaster ED Ltd of Kelso. The rings were over and weighed in excess of four tonnes. This was in preparation for Newcastle hosting the Olympic football tournament, and the Olympic torch relay, in which Bear Grylls zipwired from the top of the arch, to Gateshead quayside.

On 28 June 2012, a large lightning bolt struck the Tyne Bridge. It lit up the roads as the sky was very dark. The bolt, part of a super-cell thunderstorm, came with heavy rain – a month&#x27;s worth of rainfall in just two hours – causing flash flooding on Tyneside.

In 2015, Newcastle upon Tyne was a host city for the Rugby World Cup. Three matches were played at St James&#x27;s Park, the home of Newcastle United Football Club. In recognition, a large illuminated sign was erected on Tyne Bridge. Similarly, the bridge was depicted in an official BBC trailer for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup (in reference to Newcastle being one of the host cities).

On 13 November 2017, the Tyne Bridge was the venue for the Freedom on the Tyne finale, the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The festival commemorated Newcastle&#x27;s civil rights history and the 50 years since Dr Martin Luther King&#x27;s visit to Newcastle, where King received his honorary degree from Newcastle University.

Newcastle University and Freedom City 2017 wanted to use the Tyne Bridge to symbolically hark back in history to Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama where King was involved in one of the key moments for the struggle for civil rights in 1965. 24 roads around the Tyne Bridge were closed for the day long event. The Freedom of the Tyne event featured the many civil right stories from history. The final event, revolved around the Jarrow Crusade which was described as a memorable closing to the finale.
===Maintenance===
The bridge had a major refurbishment in 2001.

In June 2022, the Department for Transport and the local government funded the cycled refurbishment of the bridge. The costs increased from £12 million to £32 million during the negotiation period. On 11 September 2023, work began, and estimations calculated the work would take four years. The agreement involved a full repaint of the rusted steelwork. The local governments from Newcastle and Gateshead also contracted work for critical structural repairs, including steel and concrete fixes, bridge joint replacements, drainage improvements, waterproofing and resurfacing, and parapet protection. Work on the main bridge deck started in April 2024, with completion expected in time for the bridge&#x27;s centenary in 2028.

==Grade II* listed by Historic England==
On 23 August 2018, the bridge was Grade II* listed by Historic England. The rating means the bridge is &quot;a particular important structure of more than special interest.&quot; The bridge was upgraded by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on the advice of Historic England.

The bridge was upgraded to Grade II* for architectural and historical interest, as outlined here:

==Kittiwake colony==
The bridge and nearby structures are used as a nesting site by a colony of around 700 pairs of black-legged kittiwakes, the furthest inland in the world. The colony featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Springwatch&quot; programme in 2010. Several groups, including the Natural History Society of Northumbria and local Wildlife Trusts, formed a &quot;Tyne Kittiwake Partnership&quot; to safeguard the colony. A proposal for a tower to be built as an alternative nesting site was made in 2011, and in November 2015 a neighbouring hotel submitted a planning application for measures to discourage the birds.

<doc id="450915" wikidata="Q7207986" url="?curid=450915" title="Point Clear">
<text>Point Clear is a village in the civil parish of St Osyth, south-west of the village of St Osyth and on the other side of St Osyth Creek, a branch of the Colne Estuary in the Tendring district, in the county of Essex, England. In 2018 it had an estimated population of 1674.

== History ==
It first appeared on a map in 1880. From Point Clear, it is possible to see the now much expanded town of Brightlingsea. Further in the distance, visitors will be able to see Mersea Island. Although Point Clear is located on the coast, there is no boating tradition. There are many elderly bungalows and chalets, which can only be used as holiday homes, due to the risk of flooding during the winter months. A track before you reach Point Clear takes visitors down to the village of Lee-over-Sands. There is a pub housed in the Martello Tower and a small cafe in Point Clear.

Two Martello Towers, the first on the east coast, were built against a possible invasion by Napoleon in 1809. The southern one, level with the roundabout and bus stop, was used as a naturalist&#x27;s holiday home, and later an amateur radio station and test site for Marconi&#x27;s. It was pulled down in the 1960s and bungalows now stand on the site. The northern tower was used by the Navy in both world wars, and the minefield control and signals bunker added in 1940 can still be seen on top. For many years a tea shop was attached. It is now the East Essex Aviation Museum. In the Second World War the whole area was strongly fortified, and was a Royal Navy and Marines landing craft training base.

The present Orchards Caravan Park is a much expanded version of a smaller camp and houses touring caravans and mobile homes.

Until 1940, a line of beach huts ran right down to the tip of the Peninsula at St Osyth Stone – nowadays that area is open. but many new houses have been added on the road back towards St Osyth village.

<doc id="450918" wikidata="Q454042" url="?curid=450918" title="Lobsang Rampa">
<text>Lobsang Rampa was the pen name of Cyril Henry Hoskin (8 April 1910 – 25 January 1981), an author who wrote books with paranormal and occult themes. His best known work is &quot;The Third Eye&quot;, published in Britain in 1956.

Following the publication of the book, newspapers reported that Rampa had been born Cyril Henry Hoskin, and was a surgical fitter and plumber&#x27;s son from Plympton in Devon who claimed that his body hosted the spirit of a Tibetan lama going by the name of Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, who is purported to have authored the books. The name Tuesday relates to a claim in &quot;The Third Eye&quot; that Tibetans are named after the day of the week on which they were born.

==&quot;The Third Eye&quot;==
Rampa&#x27;s book &quot;The Third Eye&quot; was published in November 1956 in the United Kingdom. The book purported to relate Rampa&#x27;s experiences while growing up in Chakpori Lamasery, Chokpori, Tibet, after being sent there at the age of seven. The title of the book is derived from an operation, similar to trepanation, that Rampa claimed he had undergone, in which a small hole was drilled into his forehead to arouse the third eye and enhance powers of clairvoyance. The book describes the operation as follows:

During the story, Rampa sees yetis and eventually encounters a mummified body of himself from an earlier incarnation. He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the Earth was struck by another planet, causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today.

The manuscript of &quot;The Third Eye&quot; had been turned down by several leading British publishers before being accepted by Secker and Warburg for an advance of £800 (£ today). Fredric Warburg of Secker and Warburg had met the book&#x27;s author, who at the time appeared in the guise of &quot;Doctor Carl Kuon Suo&quot;. Intrigued by the writer&#x27;s personality, Warburg sent the manuscript to a number of scholars, several of whom expressed doubts about its authenticity. Nevertheless, the book was published in November 1956 and soon became a global bestseller. The &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; said of the book: &quot;It came near to being a work of art.&quot;

===Controversy over authorship===

Explorer and Tibetologist Heinrich Harrer was unconvinced about the book&#x27;s origins and hired a private detective from Liverpool named Clifford Burgess to investigate Rampa. &quot;In January 1957, Scotland Yard asked him to present a Tibetan passport or a residence permit. Rampa moved to Ireland. One year later, the scholars retained the services of Clifford Burgess, a leading Liverpool private detective. Burgess&#x27;s report, when it came in, was terse. Lama Lobsang Rampa of Tibet, he determined after one month of inquiries, was none other than Cyril Henry Hoskin, a native of Plympton, Devonshire, the son of the village plumber and a high school dropout.&quot; The findings of Burgess&#x27; investigation were published in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in February 1958. Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. In 1948, he had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon Suo before adopting the name Lobsang Rampa. An obituary of Fra Andrew Bertie, Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, claims that he was involved in unmasking Lobsang Rampa as a West Country plumber.

Rampa was tracked by the British press to Howth, Ireland, and confronted with these allegations. He did not deny that he had been born as Cyril Hoskin, but claimed that his body was now occupied by the spirit of Lobsang Rampa. According to the account given in his third book, &quot;The Rampa Story&quot;, he had fallen out of a fir tree in his garden in Thames Ditton, Surrey, while attempting to photograph an owl. He was concussed and, on regaining his senses, had seen a Buddhist monk in saffron robes walking towards him. The monk spoke to him about Rampa taking over his body and Hoskin agreed, saying that he was dissatisfied with his current life. When Rampa&#x27;s original body became too worn out to continue (following the events of his second book &quot;Doctor From Lhasa&quot; where, as a doctor in charge, he was questioned and tortured to the brink of death by the Japanese after being seized in the advance following the capture of Nanning as part of the Battle of South Guangxi), he took over Hoskin&#x27;s body in a process of transmigration of the soul.

Rampa maintained for the rest of his life that &quot;The Third Eye&quot; was a true story. In the foreword to the 1964 edition of the book, he wrote: &quot;I am Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, that is my only name, now my legal name, and I answer to no other.&quot;

To Donald S. Lopez, Jr., an American Tibetologist, the books of Lobsang Rampa are &quot;the works of an unemployed surgical fitter, the son of a plumber, seeking to support himself as a ghostwriter.&quot;

The authorship controversy was dramatised in a radio play, &quot;The Third Eye and the Private Eye&quot;, by David Lemon and Mark Ecclestone, first broadcast by BBC Radio 4 in August 2012.

===Influence on Tibetologists&#x27; callings===
Donald S. Lopez, Jr., in &quot;Prisoners of Shangri-La&quot; (1998), points out that when discussing Rampa with other Tibetologists and Buddhologists in Europe, he found that &quot;The Third Eye&quot; was the first book many of them had read about Tibet: &quot;For some it was a fascination with the world Rampa described that had led them to become professional scholars of Tibet.&quot;

Lopez adds that when he gave &quot;The Third Eye&quot; to a class of his at the University of Michigan without telling them about its history, the &quot;students were unanimous in their praise of the book, and despite six prior weeks of lectures and readings on Tibetan history and religion, [...] they found it entirely credible and compelling, judging it more realistic than anything they had previously read about Tibet.&quot;

== Role in the Tibetan cause ==

Lobsang Rampa was a supporter of the Tibetan cause despite criticism of his books. In 1972, Rampa&#x27;s French language agent Alain Stanké wrote to the Dalai Lama and asked for his opinion about Rampa&#x27;s identity. He received a reply from the Dalai Lama&#x27;s deputy secretary stating &quot;I wish to inform you that we do not place credence in the books written by the so-called Dr. T. Lobsang Rampa. His works are highly imaginative and fictional in nature.&quot; The Dalai Lama had previously admitted that although the books were fictitious, they had created good publicity for Tibet.

==Later career==
Lobsang Rampa went on to write another 18 books containing a mixture of religious and occult material. One of the books, &quot;Living with the Lama&quot;, was described as being dictated to Rampa by his pet Siamese cat, Mrs. Fifi Greywhiskers. Faced with repeated accusations from the British press that he was a charlatan and a con artist, Rampa went to live in Canada in the 1960s. He and his wife, San Ra&#x27;ab, became Canadian citizens in 1973, along with his companion and secretary Sheelagh Rouse (&quot;Buttercup&quot;), described by the writer Eric Newby, sent by Rampa&#x27;s publisher Secker and Warburg to meet Rampa in Ireland, as &quot;a fresh-faced, very English-looking girl who told me that she had left her husband (who was a member of Lloyd&#x27;s) and her three children in order to live as a disciple in the Lama&#x27;s house&quot;. Lobsang Rampa died in Calgary on 25 January 1981, at the age of 70.

<text>Cynon Valley () is a former coal mining valley in Wales. It lies between Rhondda and the Merthyr Valley and takes its name from the River Cynon. Aberdare is located in the north of the valley and Mountain Ash in the south. From 1974 to 1996, Cynon Valley was a local government district.

At the 2001 census, the Cynon Valley had a population of 63,512, 12.1% of whom were Welsh speakers. In common with some of the other South Wales Valleys, Cynon Valley had a high percentage of Welsh speakers until the early 20th century.

==Former district==
From 1974 to 1996, the borough of Cynon Valley was one of thirty-seven districts of Wales. The district was formed from the Aberdare and Mountain Ash urban districts, the parish of Rhigos from Neath Rural District and the parish of Penderyn from Brecknockshire. It was one of six districts of Mid Glamorgan, and in 1996 was merged into the larger unitary authority of Rhondda Cynon Taf. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence, the Labour Party held a majority of the seats on the council. The council was based at Rock Grounds on High Street in Aberdare, which was built in 1938 for one of the council&#x27;s predecessors, Aberdare Urban District Council.

==Parliamentary and Senedd constituency==
In 1983, the parliamentary constituency of Cynon Valley was formed for the election of a member of parliament to the House of Commons. The constituency had identical boundaries to the local government district.

In 1999, a Welsh Assembly constituency with the same boundaries was formed.

In 2010, the constituency was redefined as consisting of 15 electoral divisions of the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf: Aberaman North, Aberaman South, Abercynon, Aberdare East, Aberdare West/Llwydcoed, Cilfynydd, Cwmbach, Glyncoch, Hirwaun, Mountain Ash East, Mountain Ash West, Penrhiwceiber, Pen-y-waun, Rhigos, Ynysybwl.

The two main towns are Aberdare and Mountain Ash.

<doc id="450921" wikidata="Q239060" url="?curid=450921" title="Arab Revolt">
<text>The Arab Revolt ( ), also known as the Great Arab Revolt ( ), was an armed uprising by the Hashemite-led Arabs of the Hejaz against the Ottoman Empire amidst the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.

On the basis of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence, exchanged between Henry McMahon of the United Kingdom and Hussein bin Ali of the Kingdom of Hejaz, the rebellion against the ruling Turks was officially initiated at Mecca on 10 June 1916. The primary goal of the Arab rebels was to establish an independent and unified Arab state stretching from Aleppo to Aden, which the British government had promised to recognize.

The Sharifian Army, led by Hussein and the Hashemites with backing from the British military&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force, successfully fought and expelled the Ottoman military presence from much of the Hejaz and Transjordan. By 1918, the rebels had captured Damascus and proclaimed the Arab Kingdom of Syria, a short-lived monarchy that was led by Hussein&#x27;s son Faisal I.

Having covertly signed the Sykes–Picot Agreement with the French Third Republic, the British reneged on their promise to support the Arabs&#x27; establishment of a singular Arab state. Instead, the Arab-majority Ottoman territories of the Middle East were broken up into a number of League of Nations mandates, jointly controlled by the British and the French. Amidst the partition of the Ottoman Empire, the defeated Ottomans&#x27; mainland in Anatolia came under a joint military occupation by the victorious Allies. This was gradually broken by the Turkish War of Independence, which established the present-day Republic of Turkey.

== Background ==
The rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire dates from at least 1821. Arab nationalism has its roots in the Mashriq, the Arab lands east of Egypt, particularly in countries of the Levant. The political orientation of Arab nationalists before World War I was generally moderate. Their demands were of a reformist nature and generally limited to autonomy, a greater use of Arabic in education and changes in peacetime conscription in the Ottoman Empire to allow Arab conscripts local service in the Ottoman army.

The Young Turk Revolution began on 3 July 1908 and quickly spread throughout the empire. As a result, Sultan Abdul Hamid II was forced to announce the restoration of the 1876 constitution and the reconvening of the Ottoman parliament. The period is known as the Second Constitutional Era. In the 1908 elections, the Young Turks&#x27; Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) managed to gain the upper hand against the Liberal Union, led by Sultanzade Sabahaddin. The new parliament had 142 Turks, 60 Arabs, 25 Albanians, 23 Greeks, 12 Armenians (including four Dashnaks and two Hunchaks), five Jews, four Bulgarians, three Serbs and one Vlach.

The CUP now gave more emphasis to centralisation and a modernisation. It preached a message that was a mixture of pan-Islamism, Ottomanism, and pan-Turkism, which was adjusted as the conditions warranted. At heart, the CUP were Turkish nationalists who wanted to see the Turks as the dominant group within the Ottoman Empire, which antagonised Arab leaders and prompted them to think in similarly nationalistic terms.

Arab members of the parliament supported the countercoup of 1909, which aimed to dismantle the constitutional system and to restore the absolute monarchy of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The dethroned sultan attempted to restore the Ottoman Caliphate by putting an end to the secular policies of the Young Turks. He was driven away to exile in Selanik by the 31 March Incident, in which the Young Turks defeated the countercoup. He was eventually replaced by his brother Mehmed V.

In 1913, intellectuals and politicians from the Mashriq met in Paris at the First Arab Congress. They produced a set of demands for greater autonomy and equality within the Ottoman Empire, including for elementary and secondary education in Arab lands to be delivered in Arabic, for peacetime Arab conscripts to the Ottoman army to serve near their home region and for at least three Arab ministers in the Ottoman cabinet.

== Forces ==
It is estimated that the Arab forces involved in the revolt numbered around 5,000 soldiers. This number probably applies to the Arab regulars who fought during the Sinai and Palestine campaign with Edmund Allenby&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force, and not the irregular forces under the direction of T. E. Lawrence and Faisal, though other sources place this number lower, at 2,000-3,500 soldiers. On a few occasions, particularly during the final campaign into Syria, this number grew significantly. The Arab Bureau of the British Empire in Cairo believed that the revolt would draw the support of all Arabs throughout the Ottoman Empire and Arab lands.

Faisal and Sharif Hussein reportedly expected to be joined by 100,000 Arab troops. The large desertions predicted by the British Arab Bureau never materialized, as the majority of Arab officers remained loyal to the Ottomans until the end. Many Arabs joined the Revolt sporadically, often as a campaign was in progress, or only when the fighting entered their home region. During the Battle of Aqaba, for instance, while the initial Arab force numbered only a few hundred, over a thousand more from local tribes joined them for the final assault on Aqaba. Estimates of Faisal&#x27;s effective forces vary, but through most of 1918 at least, they may have numbered as high as 30,000 men, though it is claimed that the initial forces numbered at 70,000, and even 100,000+.

The Hashemite Army comprised two distinctive forces: tribal irregulars who waged a guerrilla war against the Ottoman Empire and the Sharifian Army, which was recruited from Ottoman Arab POWs and fought in conventional battles. Hashemite forces were initially poorly equipped, but later received significant supplies of weapons, most notably rifles and machine guns from Britain and France.

In the early days of the revolt, Faisal&#x27;s forces were largely made up of Bedouins and other nomadic desert tribes, who were only loosely allied, loyal more to their respective tribes than the overall cause. The Bedouin would not fight unless paid in advance with gold coin. By the end of 1916, the French had spent 1.25 million gold francs in subsidizing the revolt. By September 1918, the British were spending £220,000/month to subsidize the revolt.

Faisal had hoped that he could convince Arab troops serving in the Ottoman Army to mutiny and join his cause, but the Ottoman government sent most of its Arab troops to the Western front-lines of the war, and thus only a handful of deserters actually joined the Arab forces until later in the campaign.

By the beginning of the First World War, Arab conscripts constituted about 30% of the wartime Ottoman military of 3 million, serving in all ranks, from the lowest to the highest, and forming a crucial component of the Ottoman Army. Ottoman troops in the Hejaz numbered 20,000 men by 1917. At the outbreak of the revolt in June 1916, the VII Corps of the Fourth Army was stationed in the Hejaz. It was joined by the 58th Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Ali Necib Pasha, the 1st &quot;Kuvvie- Mürettebe&quot; (Provisional Force) led by General Mehmed Cemal Pasha, which had the responsibility of safeguarding the Hejaz railway and the Hejaz Expeditionary Force (), which was under the command of General Fakhri Pasha.

In face of increasing attacks on the Hejaz railway, the 2nd &quot;Kuvve i Mürettebe&quot; was created by 1917. The Ottoman force included a number of Arab units who stayed loyal to the Sultan-Caliph and fought well against the Allies.

The Ottoman troops enjoyed an advantage over the Hashemite troops at first, in that they were well supplied with modern German weapons. The Ottoman forces had the support of both the Ottoman Aviation Squadrons, air squadrons from Germany and the Ottoman Gendarmerie or &quot;zaptı&quot;. The Ottomans relied upon the support of Emir Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Rashid of the Emirate of Jabal Shammar, whose tribesmen dominated what is now northern Saudi Arabia, and tied down both the Hashemites and Saʻudi forces with the threat of their raiding attacks.

The great weakness of the Ottoman forces was they were at the end of a long and tenuous supply line in the form of the Hejaz railway, and because of their logistical weaknesses, were often forced to fight on the defensive. Ottoman offensives against the Hashemite forces more often faltered due to supply problems than to the actions of the enemy.

The main contribution of the Arab Revolt to the war was to pin down tens of thousands of Ottoman troops who otherwise might have been used to attack the Suez Canal and conquering Damascus, allowing the British to undertake offensive operations with a lower risk of counter-attack. This was the British justification for supporting the revolt, a textbook example of asymmetric warfare that has been studied time and again by military leaders and historians alike.

== History ==
=== Revolt ===

The Ottoman Empire took part in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I, under the terms of the Ottoman–German Alliance. Many Arab nationalist figures in Damascus and Beirut were arrested, then tortured. The flag of the resistance was designed by Sir Mark Sykes, in an effort to create a feeling of &quot;Arab-ness&quot;, in order to fuel the revolt.

==== Prelude (November 1914 – October 1916) ====

When Herbert Kitchener was Consul-General in Egypt, contacts between Abdullah and Kitchener culminated in a telegram of 1 November 1914 from Kitchener, recently appointed as Secretary of War, to Hussein, wherein Britain would, in exchange for support from the Arabs of Hejaz, &quot;guarantee the independence, rights and privileges of the Sharifate against all foreign external aggression, in particular that of the Ottomans.&quot; The Sharif indicated that he could not break with the Ottomans immediately, and it did not happen till the following year.

From 14 July 1915, to 10 March 1916, ten letters, five from each side, were exchanged between Sir Henry McMahon and Sherif Hussein. Hussein&#x27;s letter of 18 February 1916 appealed to McMahon for £50,000 in gold, plus weapons, ammunition, and food. Faisal claimed that he was awaiting the arrival of &#x27;not less than 100,000 people&#x27; for the planned revolt. McMahon&#x27;s reply of 10 March 1916 confirmed British agreement to the requests and concluded the correspondence.

Hussein, who until then had officially been on the Ottoman side, was now convinced that his assistance to the Triple Entente would be rewarded by an Arab empire, encompassing the entire span between Egypt and Qajar Iran, with the exception of imperial possessions and interests in Kuwait, Aden, and the Syrian coast. He decided to join the Allied camp immediately, because of rumours that he would soon be deposed as Sharif of Mecca by the Ottoman government in favor of Sharif Ali Haidar, leader of the rival Zaʻid family. The much-publicized executions of the Arab nationalist leaders in Damascus led Hussein to fear for his life if he were deposed in favour of Ali Haidar.

Hussein had about 50,000 men under arms, but fewer than 10,000 had rifles. On 5 June 1916, two of Hussein&#x27;s sons, the emirs ʻAli and Faisal, began the revolt by attacking the Ottoman garrison in Medina, but were defeated by an aggressive Turkish defence, led by Fakhri Pasha. The revolt proper began on 10 June 1916, when Hussein ordered his supporters to attack the Ottoman garrison in Mecca. In the Battle of Mecca, there ensued over a month of bloody street fighting between the out-numbered, but far better armed Ottoman troops and Hussein&#x27;s tribesmen. Hashemite forces in Mecca were joined by Egyptian troops sent by the British, who provided much needed artillery support, and took Mecca on 9 July 1916.

Indiscriminate Ottoman artillery fire, which did much damage to Mecca, turned out to be a potent propaganda weapon for the Hashemites, who portrayed the Ottomans as desecrating Islam&#x27;s most holy city. Also on 10 June, another of Hussein&#x27;s sons, the Emir Abdullah, attacked Ta&#x27;if, which after an initial repulse, settled down into a siege. With the Egyptian artillery support, Abdullah took Ta&#x27;if on 22 September 1916.

French and British naval forces cleared the Red Sea of Ottoman gunboats early in the war. The port of Jeddah was attacked by 3,500 Arabs on 10 June 1916 with the assistance of bombardment by British warships and seaplanes. The seaplane carrier , provided crucial air support to the Hashemite forces. The Ottoman garrison surrendered on 16 June. By the end of September 1916, the Sharifian Army had taken the coastal cities of Rabigh, Yanbu, al Qunfudhah, and 6,000 Ottoman prisoners with the assistance of the Royal Navy.

The capture of the Red Sea ports allowed the British to send over a force of 700 Ottoman Arab POWs, who primarily came from what is now Iraq, who had decided to join the revolt led by Nuri al-Saʻid and a number of Muslim troops from French North Africa. Fifteen thousand well-armed Ottoman troops remained in the Hejaz. A direct attack on Medina in October resulted in a bloody repulse of the Arab forces.

==== Arrival of T. E. Lawrence (October 1916 – January 1917) ====
In June 1916, the British sent out a number of officials to assist the revolt in the Hejaz, most notably Colonel Cyril Wilson, Colonel Pierce C. Joyce, and Lt-Colonel Stewart Francis Newcombe. Herbert Garland was also involved. In addition, a French military mission commanded by Colonel Édouard Brémond was sent out. The French enjoyed an advantage over the British in that they included a number of Muslim officers, such as Captain Muhammand Ould Ali Raho, Claude Prost, and Laurent Depui. The latter two converted to Islam during their time in Arabia. Captain Rosario Pisani of the French Army, though not a Muslim, played a notable role in the revolt as an engineering and artillery officer with the Arab Northern Army.

The British government in Egypt sent a young officer, Captain T. E. Lawrence, to work with the Hashemite forces in the Hejaz in October 1916.Lawrence arrived in Jeddah together with Ronald Sorrs, Secretary for the Orient at the Cairo Residency and Sir Henry McMahon&#x27;s trusted aide in the delicate negotiations with Sharif Hussein. In 1916 had the rebellion had during the last momths not gone according to the wishes of Sharif Hussein bin Ali . It had come to a standstill, which in the case of an irregular war is always the beginning of the end. Lawrence suspected that what was missing was the right leadership. The main purpose of Lawrence&#x27;s visit was to find the man who could become the soul of the rebellion and lead to the goal, Lawrence had set. After traveling a long distance by camel to meet with various leaders of the rebellion, Lawrence concluded that Feisal, Hussein&#x27;s third son, was the right candidate. The Arab rebels in Jeddah suffered from a severe shortage of weapons, a lack of ammunition, no machine guns and only 2 cannons. The weapons they had were very outdated compared to the weapons of the Ottoman army. Lawrence judged that there was potential for success for the rebels in the war against the Ottomans if the British equipped them with more modern weapons, a few specialists in these weapons and cooperated with Feisal. Lawrence traveled to Cairo and submitted a long report to his superior and to General Reginald Wingate. The British historian David Murphy wrote that though Lawrence was just one out of many British and French officers serving in Arabia, historians often write as though it was Lawrence alone who represented the Allied cause in Arabia.

David Hogarth credited Gertrude Bell for much of the success of the Arab Revolt. She had travelled extensively in the Middle East since 1888, after graduating from Oxford with a First in Modern History. Bell met Sheikh Harb of the Howeitat in January 1914 and thus was able to provide a &quot;mass of information&quot; which was crucial to the success of Lawrence&#x27;s occupation of Aqaba, covering the &quot;tribal elements ranging between the Hejaz Railway and the Nefud, particularly about the Howeitat group.&quot; It was this information, Hogarth emphasized, which &quot;Lawrence, relying on her reports, made signal use of in the Arab campaigns of 1917 and 1918.&quot;

Lawrence obtained assistance from the Royal Navy to turn back an Ottoman attack on Yenbu in December 1916. Lawrence&#x27;s major contribution to the revolt was convincing the Arab leaders, Faisal and Abdullah, to co-ordinate their actions in support of British strategy. Lawrence developed a close relationship with Faisal, whose Arab Northern Army was to become the main beneficiary of British aid. By contrast, Lawrence&#x27;s relations with Abdullah were not good, so Abdullah&#x27;s Arab Eastern Army received considerably less in way of British aid. Lawrence persuaded the Arabs not to drive the Ottomans out of Medina. Instead, the Arabs attacked the Hejaz railway on many occasions. This tied up more Ottoman troops, who were forced to protect the railway and repair the constant damage.

On 1 December 1916, Fakhri Pasha began an offensive with three brigades out of Medina, with the aim of taking the port of Yanbu. At first, Fakhri&#x27;s troops defeated the Hashemite forces in several engagements, and seemed set to take Yanbu. On 11–12 December 1916, it was fire and air support from the five ships of the Royal Navy Red Sea Patrol that defeated the Ottoman attempts to take Yanbu, with heavy losses. Fakhri then turned his forces south to take Rabegh, but owing to the guerrilla attacks on his flanks and supply lines, air attacks from the newly established Royal Flying Corps base at Yanbu, and the over-extension of his supply lines, he was forced to turn back on 18 January 1917, to Medina.

The coastal city of Wejh was to be the base for attacks on the Hejaz railway. On 3 January 1917, Faisal began an advance northward along the Red Sea coast with 5,100 camel riders, 5,300 men on foot, four Krupp mountain guns, ten machine guns, and 380 baggage camels. The Royal Navy resupplied Faisal from the sea during his march on Wejh. While the 800-man Ottoman garrison prepared for an attack from the south, a landing party of 400 Arabs and 200 Royal Navy bluejackets attacked Wejh from the north on 23 January 1917. Wejh surrendered within 36 hours, and the Ottomans abandoned their advance toward Mecca in favor of a defensive position in Medina, with small detachments scattered along the Hejaz railway.

The Arab force had increased to about 70,000 men, armed with 28,000 rifles and deployed in three main groups. Ali&#x27;s force threatened Medina, Abdullah operated from Wadi Ais harassing Ottoman communications and capturing their supplies, and Faisal based his force at Wejh. Camel-mounted Arab raiding parties had an effective radius of 1,000 miles (1,600 km), carrying their own food and taking water from a system of wells approximately 100 miles (160 km) apart.

In late 1916, the Allies started the formation of the Regular Arab Army, also known as the Sharifian Army, raised from Ottoman Arab POWs. The soldiers of the Regular Army wore British-style uniforms with the &quot;keffiyahs&quot; and, unlike the tribal guerrillas, fought full-time and in conventional battles. Some of the more notable former Ottoman officers to fight in the Revolt were Nuri as-Said, Ja&#x27;far al-Askari and &#x27;Aziz &#x27;Ali al-Misri.

==== Northward expeditions (January–November 1917) ====
The year 1917 began well for the Hashemites, when the Emir Abdullah and his Arab Eastern Army ambushed an Ottoman convoy led by Ashraf Bey in the desert, and captured £20,000 worth of gold coins that were intended to bribe the Bedouin into loyalty to the Sultan. Starting in early 1917, the Hashemite guerrillas began attacking the Hejaz railway. At first, guerrilla forces commanded by officers from the Regular Army such as al-Misri, and by British officers such as Newcombe, Lieutenant Hornby and Major Herbert Garland focused their efforts on blowing up unguarded sections of the Hejaz railway. Garland was the inventor of the so-called &quot;Garland mine&quot;, which was used with much destructive force on the Hejaz railway.

In February 1917, Garland succeeded for the first time in destroying a moving locomotive with a mine of his own design. In February 1917, around Medina, Captain Muhammad Ould Ali Raho of the French Military Mission carried out his first railway demolition attack. Captain Raho emerged as one of the leading destroyers of the Hejaz railway. In March 1917, Lawrence led his first attack on the Hejaz railway. Typical of such attacks was the one commanded by Newcombe and Joyce, who on the night of 6/7 July 1917, planted over 500 charges on the Hejaz railway, which all went off at about 2 am. In a raid in August 1917, Captain Raho led a force of Bedouin in destroying 5 kilometers of the Hejaz railway and four bridges.

In March 1917, an Ottoman force joined by tribesmen from Jabal Shammar led by Ibn Rashid carried out a sweep of the Hejaz, that did much damage to the Hashemite forces. However, the Ottoman failure to take Yanbu in December 1916 led to the increased strengthening of the Hashemite forces, and led to the Ottoman forces to go on the defensive. Lawrence later claimed that the failure of the offensive against Yanbu was the turning point that ensured the ultimate defeat of the Ottomans in the Hejaz.

In 1917, Lawrence arranged a joint action with the Arab irregulars and forces under Auda Abu Tayi, until then, in the employ of the Ottomans, against the port city of Aqaba. This is now known as the Battle of Aqaba. Aqaba was the only remaining Ottoman port on the Red Sea and threatened the right flank of Britain&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force defending Egypt, and preparing to advance into Sanjak Maan of the Syria Vilayet. Capture of Aqaba would aid transfer of British supplies to the Arab revolt. Lawrence and Auda left Wedj on 9 May 1917 with a party of 40 men, to recruit a mobile force from the Howeitat, a tribe located in the area. On 6 July, after an overland attack, Aqaba fell to those Arab forces with only a handful of casualties.

Lawrence then rode 150 miles to Suez to arrange Royal Navy delivery of food and supplies for the 2,500 Arabs and 700 Ottoman prisoners in Aqaba. Soon the city was co-occupied by a large Anglo-French flotilla, including warships and sea planes, which helped the Arabs secure their hold on Aqaba. Even as the Hashemite armies advanced, they still encountered sometimes fierce opposition from local residents. In July 1917, residents of the town of Karak fought against the Hashemite forces and turned them back. Later in 1917, British intelligence reports suggested that most of the tribes in the region east of the Jordan River were &quot;firmly in the Ottoman camp.&quot; The tribes feared repressions and losing the money they had received from the Ottomans for their loyalty.

Later in 1917, the Hashemite warriors made a series of small raids on Ottoman positions in support of British General Allenby&#x27;s winter attack on the Gaza–Bersheeba defensive line, which led to the Battle of Beersheba. Typical of such raids was one led by Lawrence in September 1917, that saw Lawrence destroy a Turkish rail convoy by blowing up the bridge it was crossing at Mudawwara and then ambushing the Turkish repair party. In November 1917, as aid to Allenby&#x27;s offensive, Lawrence launched a deep-raiding party into the Yarmouk River valley, which failed to destroy the railway bridge at Tel ash-Shehab, but succeeded in ambushing and destroying the train of General Mehmed Cemal Pasha, the commander of the Ottoman VII Corps. Allenby&#x27;s victories led directly to the British capture of Jerusalem just before Christmas 1917.

==== Increased Allied assistance and the end of fighting (November 1917– October 1918) ====

By the time of Aqaba&#x27;s capture, many other officers joined Faisal&#x27;s campaign. A large number of British officers and advisors, led by Lt. Col.s Stewart F. Newcombe and Cyril E. Wilson, arrived to provide the Arabs rifles, explosives, mortars, and machine guns. Artillery was only sporadically supplied due to a general shortage, though Faisal would have several batteries of mountain guns under French Captain Pisani and his Algerians for the Megiddo Campaign. Egyptian and Indian troops also served with the Revolt, primarily as machine gunners and specialist troops, a number of armoured cars were allocated for use. The Royal Flying Corps often supported the Arab operations, and the Imperial Camel Corps served with the Arabs for a time.

The French military mission of 1,100 officers under Brémond established good relations with Hussein and especially with his sons, the Emirs Ali and Abdullah, and for this reason, most of the French effort went into assisting the Arab Southern Army commanded by the Emir Ali that was laying siege to Medina and the Eastern Army commanded by Abdullah that had the responsibility of protecting Ali&#x27;s eastern flank from Ibn Rashid. Medina was never taken by the Hashemite forces, and the Ottoman commander, Fakhri Pasha, only surrendered Medina when ordered to by the Turkish government on 9 January 1919. The total number of Ottoman troops bottled up in Medina by the time of the surrender were 456 officers and 9,364 soldiers.

Under the direction of Lawrence, Wilson, and other officers, the Arabs launched a highly successful campaign against the Hejaz railway, capturing military supplies, destroying trains and tracks, and tying down thousands of Ottoman troops. Though the attacks were mixed in success, they achieved their primary goal of tying down Ottoman troops and cutting off Medina. In January 1918, in one of the largest set-piece battles of the Revolt, Arab forces, including Lawrence, defeated a large Ottoman force at the Battle of Tafilah, inflicting over 1,000 Ottoman casualties for the loss of a mere forty men.

In March 1918 the Arab Northern Army consisted of
:Arab Regular Army commanded by Ja&#x27;far Pasha el Askeri
::brigade of infantry
::one battalion Camel Corps
::one battalion mule-mounted infantry
::about eight guns
:British Section commanded by Lieutenant Colonel P. C. Joyce
::Hejaz Armoured Car Battery of Rolls-Royce light armoured cars with machine guns and two 10-pdr guns on Talbot lorries
::one Flight of aircraft
::one Company Egyptian Camel Corps
::Egyptian Camel Transport Corps
::Egyptian Labour Corps
::Wireless Station at &#x27;Aqaba
:French Detachment commanded by Captain Pisani
::two mountain guns
::four machine guns and 10 automatic rifles

In April 1918, Ja&#x27;far al-Askari and Nuri as-Said led the Arab Regular Army in a frontal attack on the well-defended Ottoman railway station at Ma&#x27;an, which after some initial successes was fought off with heavy losses to both sides. However, the Sharifian Army succeeded in cutting off and thus neutralizing the Ottoman position at Ma&#x27;an, who held out until late September 1918. The British refused several requests from al-Askari to use mustard gas on the Ottoman garrison at Ma&#x27;an.

In the spring of 1918, Operation Hedgehog, a concerted attempt to sever and destroy the Hejaz railway, was launched. In May 1918, Hedgehog led to the destruction of 25 bridges of the Hejaz railway. On 11 May Arab regulars captured Jerdun and 140 prisoners. Five weeks later, on 24 July Nos. 5 and 7 Companies of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade commanded by Major R. V. Buxton, marched from the Suez Canal to arrive at Aqaba on 30 July, to attack the Mudawwara Station.

A particularly notable attack of Hedgehog was the storming on 8 August 1918, by the Imperial Camel Corps, closely supported by the Royal Air Force, of the well-defended Hejaz railway station at Mudawwara. They captured 120 prisoners and two guns, suffering 17 casualties in the operation. Buxton&#x27;s two companies of Imperial Camel Corps Brigade continued on towards Amman, where they hoped to destroy the main bridge. from the city they were attacked by aircraft, forcing them to withdraw eventually back to Beersheba where they arrived on 6 September; a march of in 44 days.

For the final Allied offensive intended to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war, Allenby asked that Emir Faisal and his Arab Northern Army launch a series of attacks on the main Turkish forces from the east, which was intended to both tie down Ottoman troops and force Turkish commanders to worry about their security of their flanks in the Levant. Supporting the Emir Faisal&#x27;s army of about 450 men from the Arab Regular Army were tribal contingents from the Rwalla, Bani Sakhr, Agyal, and Howeitat tribes. In addition, Faisal had a group of Gurkha troops, several British armored car squadrons, the Egyptian Camel Corps, a group of Algerian artillery men commanded by Captain Pisani and air support from the RAF to assist him.
In 1918, the Arab cavalry gained in strength, as it seemed victory was at hand, and they were able to provide Allenby&#x27;s army with intelligence on Ottoman army positions. They harassed Ottoman supply columns, attacked small garrisons, and destroyed railway tracks. A major victory occurred on 27 September when an entire brigade of Ottoman, Austrian and German troops, retreating from Mezerib, was virtually wiped out in a battle with Arab forces near the village of Tafas, which the Turks had plundered during their retreat.

This led to the so-called Tafas massacre, in which Lawrence claimed in a letter to his brother to have issued a &quot;no-prisoners&quot; order, maintaining after the war that massacre was in retaliation for the earlier Ottoman massacre of the village of Tafas, and that he had at least 250 German and Austrian POWs together with an uncounted number of Turks lined up to be summarily shot. Lawrence later wrote in &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; that &quot;In a madness born of the horror of Tafas we killed and killed, even blowing in the heads of the fallen and of the animals; as though their death and running blood could slake our agony.&quot; In part due to these attacks, Allenby&#x27;s last offensive, the Battle of Megiddo, was a stunning success.

By late September and October 1918, an increasingly demoralized Ottoman Army began to retreat and surrender whenever possible to British troops. &quot;Sherifial irregulars&quot; accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel T. E. Lawrence captured Deraa on 27 September 1918. The Ottoman army was routed in less than 10 days of battle. Allenby praised Faisal for his role in the victory: &quot;I send your Highness my greetings and my most cordial congratulations upon the great achievement of your gallant troops ... Thanks to our combined efforts, the Ottoman army is everywhere in full retreat.&quot;
The first Arab Revolt forces to reach Damascus were Sharif Naser&#x27;s Hashemite camel cavalry and the cavalry of the Ruwallah tribe, led by Nuri Sha&#x27;lan, on 30 September 1918. The bulk of these troops remained outside of the city with the intention of awaiting the arrival of Sharif Faisal. A small contingent from the group was sent within the walls of the city, where they found the Arab Revolt flag already raised by surviving Arab nationalists among the citizenry. Later that day Australian Light Horse troops marched into Damascus. Auda Abu Ta&#x27;yi, T. E. Lawrence and Arab troops rode into Damascus the next day, 1 October. At the end of the war, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force had seized Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, large parts of the Arabian peninsula and southern Syria. Medina, cut off from the rest of the Ottoman Empire, surrendered in January 1919.

== Aftermath ==

The United Kingdom agreed in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence that it would support Arab independence if they revolted against the Ottomans.

However, the United Kingdom and France reneged on the original deal and divided up the area under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement in ways that the Arabs felt were unfavourable to them. Further confusing the issue was the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which promised support for a Jewish &quot;national home&quot; in Palestine. This series of events is often characterised as a betrayal of the Arabs by the British. For a brief period, the Hejaz region of western Arabia became a self-declared state, without being universally recognised as such, under Hussein&#x27;s control. Although both Ibn Saud and Hussein received British aid, it was eventually conquered by Ibn Saud in 1925, as part of his military and sociopolitical campaign for the unification of Saudi Arabia.

The Arab Revolt is seen by historians as the first organized movement of Arab nationalism. It brought together different Arab groups for the first time with the common goal to fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Much of the history of Arab independence stemmed from the revolt beginning with the kingdom that had been founded by Hussein.

After the war, the Arab Revolt had implications. Groups of people were put into classes that were based on whether they had fought in the revolt and their rank. In Iraq, a group of Sharifian officers from the Arab Revolt formed a political party that they headed. The Hashemites in Jordan remain influenced by the actions of the revolt&#x27;s Arab leaders.

== Underlying causes ==
=== Hussein ===
According to Efraim Karsh of Bar-Ilan University, Sharif Hussein of Mecca was &quot;a man with grandiose ambitions&quot; who had first started to fall out with his masters in Istanbul when the dictatorship, a triumvirate known as the Three Pashas, General Enver Pasha, Talaat Pasha, and Cemal Pasha, which represented the radical Turkish nationalist wing of the CUP, seized power in a coup d&#x27;état in January 1913 and began to pursue a policy of Turkification, which gradually angered non-Turkish subjects. Hussein started to embrace the language of Arab nationalism only after the Young Turks revolt against the Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II in July 1908. The fighting force of the revolt was mostly combined from Ottoman defectors and Arabian tribes loyal to the Sharif.

=== Religious justification ===
Though the Sharifian revolt was described in retrospect as rooted in a secular Arab nationalist sentiment, the Sharif did not present it in those terms. Rather, he accused the Young Turks of violating the sacred tenets of Islam by pursuing the policy of Turkification and discriminating against its non-Turkish population and called Arab Muslims to sacred rebellion against the Ottoman government. The Turks answered by accusing the rebelling tribes of betraying the Muslim Caliphate during a campaign against imperialist powers attempting to divide and govern Muslim lands. The Turks said the revolting Arabs gained nothing after the revolt; rather, the Middle East was carved up by the British and French.

=== Ethnic tensions ===

While the revolt failed to garner significant support from within the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s soon-to-be Iraq provinces, it found huge support from Arab populated Levantine provinces. This early Arab nationalism came about when the majority of the Arabs living in the Ottoman Empire were loyal primarily to their own families, clans, and tribes despite efforts of the Turkish ruling class, who pursued a policy of Turkification through the Tanzimat reforms and hoped to create a feeling of &quot;Ottomanism&quot; among the different ethnicities under the Ottoman domain. Liberal reforms brought about by the Tanzimat also transformed the Ottoman Caliphate into a secular empire, which weakened the Islamic concept of Ummah that tied the different races together. The arrival of Committee of Union and Progress to power and the creation of a one-party state in 1913 which mandated Turkish nationalism as a state ideology, worsened the relationship between the Ottoman state and its non-Turkish subjects.

In the United States, Arabs and Hebrews who immigrated from Turkey petitioned the Department of State to not be classified as &quot;Turkish&quot;, but as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Hebrew&quot;.

<doc id="450930" wikidata="Q5643599" url="?curid=450930" title="Haltemprice">
<text>Haltemprice is an area in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England, directly to the west of Kingston upon Hull. Originally an extra-parochial area, it became a civil parish in 1858, in 1935 it was expanded by the combination of the urban districts of Cottingham, Anlaby, and Sculcoates to form a new urban district; the district included the villages of Anlaby, Cottingham, Hessle, Kirk Ella, Skidby, West Ella and Willerby. Urban districts were abolished 1974.

Haltemprice gave its name to the Haltemprice and Howden UK Parliament constituency between 1997 and 2024. The East Riding of Yorkshire Council run &#x27;Haltemprice Leisure Centre&#x27; in Anlaby.

==Background and etymology==

Haltemprice Priory was established as an Augustinian religious dwelling in the 14th century. The name is thought to derive from the French &quot;Haute Emprise&quot; (High enterprise). The priory existed until the 16th century and the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. Settlement continued at Haltemprice as &#x27;Haltemprice Farm&#x27;, the farm was occupied up to 1998; as of 2011 the farm building was derelict.

==Parish (1858–1974)==

Haltemprice was historically an extra-parochial area, and was made a civil parish in its own right in 1858. It was included in the Sculcoates Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894.

==Urban district (1935–1974)==

On 1 April 1935, under a County Review Order, an urban district of Haltemprice was set up, to cover Hull&#x27;s western suburbs. The Cottingham and Hessle urban districts were abolished and included into the new Haltemprice Urban District, as was part of the Sculcoates Rural District including the existing parish of Haltemprice and the parish of West Ella. In 1961 the parish had a population of 42,386.

On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Haltemprice Urban District was merged to form part of the Beverley borough in Humberside. Haltemprice parish was also abolished. The northern half of Humberside became the reconstituted East Riding in 1996. The former Haltemprice area has been since divided again into a number of civil parishes.

The area gave its name to the Parliamentary seat of Haltemprice and Howden and, as the fictional constituency of Haltemprice, was held by the fictional Tory MP Alan B&#x27;Stard in the ITV sitcom &quot;The New Statesman&quot;.

<text>The Lagan Valley (, Ulster Scots: &quot;Glen Lagan&quot;) is an area of Northern Ireland between Belfast and Lisburn. The River Lagan rises on Slieve Croob in County Down and flows generally northward discharging into Belfast Lough. For a section, the river forms part of the border between the counties of Antrim and Down.

The towpath which runs alongside the River between Lisburn and Belfast is popular with walkers, runners, cyclists, dog owners etc. It is a very scenic and peaceful area and is ideal for walking, cycling etc. As a cycle route the towpath forms part of National Cycle Route 9. There are a number of &quot;off route&quot; mountain bike trails along the route.

The Lagan Valley is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The AONB was established in 1965 and the greater part of it lies within the Greater Belfast area.

==Political constituency==
The Lagan Valley is also the name of a constituency in the House of Commons covering Lisburn and surrounding areas, as well as the Assembly constituency in the same area. There are approximately 242 townlands in the constituency area.

The UK parliamentary constituency has been a Unionist stronghold in the past, until 2024 when Alliance gained the seat from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The current MP for the constituency is Sorcha Eastwood of Alliance who was elected in the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

<text>The Borough of East Yorkshire was one of nine local government districts of the county of Humberside, England from 1 April 1974 to 1 April 1996.

The district was created as North Wolds, but was renamed by resolution of the council on 1 February 1981 (the Borough of Beverley was renamed to include &#x27;East Yorkshire&#x27; in its name the same year, leading to the borough&#x27;s councillors accusing North Wolds councillors of &quot;usurping&quot; the name). North Wolds council had made an earlier attempt in 1973, a year before it formally came into existence, to be named &quot;Bridlington and Yorkshire Wolds&quot;, however this was struck down by the Department of the Environment.

The district was formed under the Local Government Act 1972 by the amalgamation of a number of areas formerly in the administrative county of Yorkshire, East Riding: namely the municipal borough of Bridlington, Driffield urban district, Driffield Rural District, Pocklington Rural District and most of Bridlington Rural District.

The district was abolished in 1996, and merged into the new East Riding of Yorkshire local government district, which covers a much larger area.

<doc id="450937" wikidata="Q905488" url="?curid=450937" title="Flat memory model">
<text>Flat memory model or linear memory model refers to a memory addressing paradigm in which &quot;memory appears to the program as a single contiguous address space.&quot; The CPU can directly (and linearly) address all of the available memory locations without having to resort to any sort of bank switching, memory segmentation or paging schemes.

Memory management and address translation can still be implemented &quot;on top of&quot; a flat memory model in order to facilitate the operating system&#x27;s functionality, resource protection, multitasking or to increase the memory capacity beyond the limits imposed by the processor&#x27;s physical address space, but the key feature of a flat memory model is that the entire memory space is linear, sequential and contiguous.

In a simple controller, or in a &quot;single tasking&quot; embedded application, where memory management is not needed nor desirable, the flat memory model is the most appropriate, because it provides the simplest interface from the programmer&#x27;s point of view, with direct access to all memory locations and minimum design complexity.

In a general purpose computer system, which requires multitasking, resource allocation, and protection, the flat memory system must be augmented by some memory management scheme, which is typically implemented through a combination of dedicated hardware (inside or outside the CPU) and software built into the operating system. The flat memory model (at the physical addressing level) still provides the greatest flexibility for implementing this type of memory management.

==Memory models==

Most modern memory models fall into one of three categories:

===Flat unpaged memory model===
*Simple interface for programmers, clean design
*Greatest flexibility due to uniform access speed (segmented memory page switches usually incur varied latency due to longer accesses of other pages, either due to extra CPU logic in changing page, or hardware requirements)
*Minimum hardware and CPU real estate for simple controller applications
*Maximum execution speed, as there is no need to access auxiliary data structures such as a segment or page table in RAM
*Not suitable for general computing or multitasking operating systems

===Paged memory model===

*Suitable for multitasking, general operating system design, resource protection and allocation
*Suitable for virtual memory implementation
*More CPU real estate, somewhat lower speed
*More complex to program
*Rigid page boundaries, not always the most memory efficient
*This memory model is required when using Physical Address Extension (PAE) in Pentium Pro and later x86 CPUs to support 36-bit physical addresses to address more than 4GB of physical memory.

===x86 segmented memory model===
*Similar to paged memory, but paging is achieved by the implicit addition of two relatively shifted registers: segment:offset
*Variable page boundaries, more efficient and flexible than the paged memory model
*Quite complex and awkward from a programmer&#x27;s point of view
*More difficult for compilers
*Pages can overlap / poor resource protection and isolation
*Many to one address translation correspondence: Many segment:offset combinations resolve to the same physical address
*Greater chance of programming errors
*Implemented in the original Intel 8086, 8088, 80186, 80286, and supported by 80386 and all subsequent x86 machines through to present day Pentium and Core 2 processors. This memory model has remained ever since in the x86 machines, which now provide multi-mode operation and rarely operate in the compatible segmented mode. See x86 memory segmentation for details.
*saves RAM by moving the segment address, this allows short jumps that require fewer bytes.

Within the x86 architectures, when operating in the real mode (or emulation), physical address is computed as:
:Address = 16 × segment + offset
(I.e., the 16-bit segment register is shifted left by 4 bits and added to a 16-bit offset, resulting in a 20-bit address.)

<doc id="450939" wikidata="Q7346147" url="?curid=450939" title="Robert Johnson (governor)">
<text>Robert Johnson (1682–1735) served as the governor of South Carolina from 1717 to 1719 and from 1729 to 1735. Johnson ordered Colonel William Rhett to engage the notorious pirate Stede Bonnet&#x27;s sloops in the Battle of Cape Fear River with the Charleston Militia on sea in 1718. His grandson was South Carolina Senator Ralph Izard.

==Life==
Robert Johnson was the son of Sir Nathaniel Johnson and inherited a considerable estate from his father. On April 30, 1717, he was commissioned governor of South Carolina. Like his father, he soon won the confidence of the people, but coming at a time when the powers of the proprietors were already tottering, he was baffled in his efforts to conciliate the colonists, by the proprietors&#x27; own greed and folly, and in his endeavors to sustain their authority he lost whatever influence he might have exercised.

== Settling the Frontier ==
During his time as governor Johnson oversaw an innovative new approach to settling the South Carolina frontier with the hope of providing a buffer between Native Americans in the west and Charles Towne on the east coast. This &quot;Township Scheme&quot; was essentially a government subsidized settlement plan that involved the creation of townships which were treated as mini-colonies, each comprising about 20,000 acres. New settlers would be given 50 acres a piece and once a township had reached 100 settlers it would be given two seats in South Carolina&#x27;s Commons House of Assembly. Townships created under this program were Purrysburg, New Windsor, Fredericksburg, Queensborough, Kingston, Amelia, Williamsburg, Saxe Gotha, Welsh Tract, and Orangeburg.

== Pirate Wars ==

Johnson oversaw the suppression of the pirates who were preying upon the commerce of South Carolina and neighboring colonies. Fitting out an expedition, he personally commanded a victorious engagement with them off the bar of Charleston, and carried on the campaign until they were exterminated and their famous leader Stede Bonnet was captured and executed. A month or two later Johnson is also credited with the killing of a second pirate, Richard Worley.

In 1719, when the proprietary government was overthrown, the revolutionary convention, of which Arthur Middleton was president, requested him to continue in office if he would agree to administer it in the name of the king, but Johnson declined to do so, asserting the rights of the proprietors to whom he owed allegiance. James Moore Jr. was thereupon elected governor by the convention, and Johnson was set aside.

Notwithstanding the loyalty thus shown to the proprietors, he was appointed first regular royal governor of the colony on December 9, 1729, and upon his arrival at Charleston, early in 1731, was joyfully received by the people. His administration was marked by the issuance of several acts regarding the granting of land to new settlers, and by a protracted boundary dispute with North Carolina, the two colonies being for the first time constituted entirely separate provinces. He aided James Oglethorpe in the settlement of Georgia by providing food and escort to his colonists. Johnson endeared himself to the people by his high-minded character, which won for him the title of the &quot;good governor&quot;. He remained in office till his death, which took place in Charleston on May 3, 1735. In the same year the general assembly erected a monument to his memory in St. Philip&#x27;s Church, where it remained until the edifice was burned in 1835.

==Legacy==
Johnson Square in Savannah, Georgia, is named for him.

<text>WRAZ (channel 50), branded Fox 50, is a television station licensed to Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, serving as the Fox affiliate for the Research Triangle area. It is locally owned by the Capitol Broadcasting Company alongside NBC affiliate WRAL-TV (channel 5) and WNGT-CD (channel 34), which airs local news programming. The stations share studios at Capitol Broadcasting headquarters on Western Boulevard in Raleigh; WRAZ&#x27;s transmitter is located near Auburn, North Carolina.

Though a construction permit was issued for channel 50 in 1986, it did not sign on until September 7, 1995. WRAZ, originally owned by Tar Heel Broadcasting but programmed by WRAL-TV from its first day on air, offered The WB as well as syndicated shows and a WRAL-produced 10 p.m. newscast. The station had been on the air only for several months when Fox—in the middle of a dispute with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of its local affiliate, WLFL—decided to change local stations from WLFL to WRAZ beginning in 1998. Coinciding with the switch, Capitol Broadcasting moved operations of WRAZ from Raleigh to an office building it owned in Durham to give the station a separate identity. In the 2000s, WRAZ gained a reputation for preempting Fox programming it found contrary to family values, including such reality shows as &quot;Temptation Island&quot; and &quot;Married by America&quot;.

After initially moving to give WRAZ a separate identity in the community, Capitol slowly folded it back into the main operation. In 2003, the newscasts were brought in line with those on WRAL, and the station returned from Durham to Raleigh in 2012. The station offers hours a week of dedicated and simulcast newscasts from WRAL-TV.

==History==
===Construction and WB affiliation===
In March 1985, five applicants were placed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) into comparative hearing to determine which one would receive a construction permit to build channel 50 in Raleigh. The commission awarded the permit to the L Broadcasting Company, owned by Fred and Evelyn Barber and Eleanor J. Brown. Fred Barber and Brown had broadcasting connections; the former was the general manager of WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh after previously serving in that post at WRAL-TV in Raleigh, and the latter was director of personnel for Gannett&#x27;s television stations. The loser in the original decision was Cotton Broadcasting Company, whose owner, Grant Cotton, had put WLFL (channel 22) on the air and pledged to divest his interests in that station if awarded channel 50. This initial decision was appealed to the FCC review board by Cotton. The board overturned the initial decision and granted channel 50 to Cotton, finding that administrative law judge James Tierney had made a mistake in not accounting for his divestiture pledge. By 1990, Cotton had secured a transmitter site in Apex, North Carolina, and was about to search for studio space to put channel 50 into operation. He believed that the station&#x27;s location in Raleigh would be an advantage over the region&#x27;s second independent station, Fayetteville-based WKFT (channel 40).

Cotton filed to transfer the permit to Tar Heel Broadcasting, a not-for-profit company founded by Jim Layton, in 1994. The station announced its forthcoming existence as WRAZ in July 1995, including an affiliation with The WB. Tar Heel entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with the Capitol Broadcasting Company, owner of WRAL-TV, which provided its transmitter tower, programming, and facilities to operate the new station. It signed on the air on September 7, 1995, with a 50-episode marathon of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;.

The WRAZ license was sold by Tar Heel Broadcasting in 1996 to Carolina Broadcasting System, owned by former state deputy treasurer Thomas H. Campbell. The ownership change meant little in practice, as the LMA with Capitol Broadcasting remained intact. The owners did some public service programming independent from WRAL; in 1998, WRAZ began airing the Carolina Broadcasting System–produced &quot;NC Spin&quot;, a weekly political roundtable.

===Fox affiliation===
WLFL had been the Fox affiliate in the Raleigh–Durham market since the network started in 1986. By 1995, however, it was owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. In late November of that year, Fox announced that it would move its network affiliation in Norfolk, Virginia, from Sinclair-owned WTVZ to WVBT, a station that—like WRAZ—was a WB affiliate programmed by one of the market&#x27;s established stations, when its current affiliation agreement with Sinclair expired in September 1998. Three weeks later, Sinclair revealed in a terse announcement, citing nothing more than &quot;different philosophical views about the future&quot;, that Fox had decided to replace WLFL with WRAZ in the network beginning in 1998; Sinclair apparently had little confidence in Fox plans to expand to daytime and late night slots as well as in the area of news. The additional network shows threatened to encroach on lucrative fringe periods where the Sinclair stations made money. Even though relations improved between Sinclair and Fox, the network had already signed affiliation agreements with its new Raleigh and Norfolk stations and carried out the switch on August 1, 1998, with WRAZ becoming the new Fox affiliate and WLFL switching from Fox to The WB.
After the affiliation switch, WRAZ was moved from the WRAL facilities in Raleigh to on the first floor of the Diamond View I office building in Downtown Durham, next door to the Durham Bulls Athletic Park and the American Tobacco Campus—all owned and developed by Capitol. Capitol CEO James Goodmon deliberately moved WRAZ from Raleigh to Durham in order to give it a separate identity. After the FCC legalized duopolies in 1999, Capitol acquired the WRAZ license from Carolina Broadcasting for $1 million.

In the 2000s, WRAZ earned a track record of preempting Fox programming it deemed too risky or controversial. It was one of the few stations in the United States to refuse to air portions of Fox reality shows &quot;Temptation Island&quot; and &quot;Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?&quot; The former was pulled after two contestants on the show were revealed to be parents to a young child. Tommy Schenck, WRAZ&#x27;s general manager, told &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to support a program that could break up a family. We&#x27;re not going to be a part of making light of an institution.&quot; &quot;Temptation Island&quot; instead aired on WKFT. After Capitol pulled &quot;Married by America&quot; from the WRAZ lineup, it eventually earned FCC plaudits as 169 other Fox affiliates were fined for airing an episode featuring strippers. Capitol viewed the programs as anti-family. In 2005, the station refused to air the Fox series &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy?&quot;, citing its treatment of adoption. In 2009, the station delayed the series premiere of &quot;&quot; from its prime time slot to 11:35 p.m. and substituted episodes of &quot;Andy Griffith&quot; and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

WRAZ left Durham and returned to WRAL&#x27;s facilities in 2012 in conjunction with a new joint master control facility handling both stations. To accommodate the relocation of 35 employees, of space was added to the WRAL studios. In 2013, Capitol sold its other Fox affiliate, WJZY in Charlotte, to the network and received a renewal of its affiliation agreement for WRAZ.

===Newscasts===
Concurrently with its 1995 sign-on, WRAZ began airing a nightly prime-time newscast from WRAL-TV at 10 p.m. The half-hour newscast competed with WLFL&#x27;s hour-long 10 p.m. news, which debuted two years prior. As with the rest of the station after the affiliation switch of 1998, Capitol decided to separate WRAZ&#x27;s news presentation and talent from that of WRAL-TV, though it continued to come from the WRAL studios, to better match the Fox network&#x27;s imaging and serve a different audience. After becoming the Fox affiliate, WRAZ&#x27;s newscast doubled its viewership share year-over-year while WLFL slumped. In 2002, WRAZ debuted a 7 a.m. extension of WRAL-TV&#x27;s morning show, &quot;Fox Morning Connection&quot;.

In 2003, Capitol Broadcasting opted again to tie WRAZ&#x27;s news brand to WRAL&#x27;s, rebranding the newscasts as &quot;WRAL News on Fox 50&quot; and reintegrating it with WRAL&#x27;s pool of on-air personalities. WLFL, whose newscast had remained a steady competitor to WRAZ&#x27;s, slipped definitively behind when Sinclair converted the WLFL news operation to its News Central hybrid format; WLFL ceased producing newscasts in March 2006 and months later entered into an agreement with WTVD for local news coverage.

The morning newscast was extended to three hours with a 9 a.m. hour in 2019. By 2024, WRAZ aired hours a day of news on weekdays, including an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast and simulcasts with WRAL-TV from 4:30 to 7 a.m., at noon, and at 4 p.m., plus a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast on Saturdays and Sundays for a total of hours a week of news.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
The WRAZ multiplex also includes a subchannel for WRTD-CD, the region&#x27;s Telemundo owned-and-operated station.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRAZ began digital broadcasting on May 1, 2000, from a transmission tower near Garner. WRAZ discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 50, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 49.

The station was repacked from channel 49 to channel 15 on September 11, 2019, as a result of the 2016 United States wireless spectrum auction.

<doc id="450947" wikidata="Q3558419" url="?curid=450947" title="Firearms regulation in Canada">
<text>Firearms are federally regulated in Canada through the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, and the Canadian Firearms Program, a program operated within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Regulation is largely about licensing and registration of firearms, including air guns with a muzzle velocity of more than and muzzle energy greater than . 

Civilian ownership and use is legal after obtaining a possession and acquisition licence (PAL) or a restricted possession and acquisition licence (RPAL) issued by the RCMP. An RPAL is required for handguns and short-barrelled semi-automatic rifles. For PALs there is generally no justification requirements beyond not posing a risk to public safety; RPALs require either gun club membership, demonstration of sufficient firearms knowledge, or a professional carry authorization. However, firearms and licence holders are subject to heavy regulations, and there are many types of firearms that are classed as prohibited. 

Concealed carry is prohibited outside of a lawful profession (e.g. security and trapping). Open carry of non-restricted rifles is permitted only on hunting grounds such as crown land. Hunting with a restricted firearm (which includes handguns) is prohibited.

Handgun registration became law in 1934, and automatic firearms registration was added in 1951. In 1969, laws classified firearms as &quot;non-restricted&quot;, &quot;restricted&quot;, and &quot;prohibited&quot;. Starting in 1979, people who wished to acquire firearms were required to obtain a firearms acquisition certificate (FAC) from their local police agency. From 1995 to present, all firearms owners are required to possess a firearms licence—either a PAL, a possession-only licence (POL), an FAC, or a minor&#x27;s licence. In April 2012, the Parliament of Canada enacted the &quot;Ending the Long-gun Registry Act&quot; to eliminate the requirement to register non-restricted firearms that had existed from 2001 to 2012.

A 1996 study showed that Canada was in the mid-range of firearm ownership when compared with eight other western nations. Nearly 22% of Canadian households had at least one firearm, including 2.3% of households possessing a handgun. In 2005, almost 3% of households in Canada possessed handguns, compared to 18% of U.S. households that possessed handguns. Also in 2005, almost 16% of households in Canada possessed firearms of some kind. As of September 2010, the Canadian Firearms Program recorded a total of 1,831,327 valid firearm licences, which is roughly 5.4% of the Canadian population. The four most licensed provinces are Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and British Columbia.

On May 1, 2020, in the wake of a mass killing in Nova Scotia, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced an immediate prohibition on around 1,500 models of &quot;military-grade assault-style weapons&quot;, mostly semi-auto rifles, via an order in council under the authority of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. This list was expanded in December 2024, adding over 300 more models as prohibited. On October 21, 2022, the Government of Canada implemented a freeze on the sale and transfer of handguns with plans to introduce a gun buyback program. As of January 2025, the buyback program has not yet started, reportedly due to Canada Post having concerns about employee security.

==History of firearm laws==
In Canada, controls on civilian use of firearms date from the early days of Confederation, when justices of the peace could impose penalties for carrying a handgun without reasonable cause. Amendments to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; between the 1890s and the 1970s introduced a series of controls on firearms, including registration of handguns, and later, registration of fully automatic firearms. In the late 1970s, additional controls were introduced, followed by additional increases in controls in the mid-1990s.

The following is a summary of the history of gun control laws in Canada:

===1885 - 1968===
*The Parliament instituted a system of gun control in the North-West Territories in 1885 to hinder the North-West Rebellion. Permission in writing from the territorial government was needed to possess any firearm (other than a smooth-bore shotgun), and also ammunition. Possession of a firearm or ammunition without the necessary permit was an offence, and could lead to the forfeiture of the firearm and ammunition. These gun control provisions applied to all of what is now Alberta, Saskatchewan, parts of Manitoba, the current Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut.
*The &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, enacted in 1892, required individuals to have a permit to carry a pistol unless the owner had cause to fear assault or injury. Not until 1935 was it considered an offence to sell a pistol to anyone under 16. Vendors who sold handguns had to keep records, including purchaser&#x27;s name, the date of sale and a description of the gun.
*In the 1920s, permits became necessary for all firearms newly acquired by foreigners.
*Legislation in 1934 required the registration of handguns with records identifying the owner, the owner&#x27;s address and the firearm. Registration certificates were issued and records kept by the commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) or by other police forces designated by provincial attorneys general.
*In 1947, the definition of murder in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; was expanded to include situations where an individual committed certain offences such as rape, robbery, burglary, or arson while armed with a weapon, and death ensued, whether or not the accused intended to cause death. This offence was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1987 in the case of &quot;R. v. Vaillancourt&quot;.
* Automatic firearms were added to the category of firearms that had to be registered in 1951. The registry system was centralized under the commissioner of the RCMP.

===1969 - 2000===
* In 1969, Bill C-150 created categories of &quot;non-restricted&quot;, &quot;restricted&quot; and &quot;prohibited&quot; firearms. Police were also given preventive powers of search and seizure by judicial warrant if they had grounds to believe that firearms that belonged to an individual endangered the safety of society.
* In 1977, Bill C-51 required firearms acquisition certificates (FACs) to purchase any firearm, and introduced controls on the selling of ammunition. Applicants were required to pass a basic criminal record check before receiving the FAC. Fully automatic firearms were reclassified from restricted to prohibited-class, with an exception for current owners (grandfathering).
* The 1989 École Polytechnique massacre spurred a movement for stronger gun control in Canada, led by PolySeSouvient.
* In 1991, Bill C-17 was introduced, coming into force between 1992 and 1994. It required FAC applicants to pass a safety course in addition to a thorough background check, and to wait a minimum of 28 days after applying before an FAC could be issued. It also created new &quot;Criminal Code&quot; offences, new definitions for prohibited and restricted weapons, and new regulations for firearms dealers. It increased penalties for firearm-related crimes. It clearly outlined regulations for firearms storage, handling and transportation.
* A major focus of C-17 was the control of military and paramilitary firearms. It created orders prohibiting or restricting most paramilitary rifles and some types of non-sporting ammunition. It prohibited firearms that had been converted to avoid a 1978 prohibition (exempting existing owners), and it prohibited high-capacity magazines for automatic and semi-automatic firearms. (It limited handguns to ten rounds and most semi-automatic centre-fire rifles to five rounds.)
* In 1995, Bill C-68 enacted the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, with related amendments to the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. It implemented a new central licensing system to replace the FAC system. It also required registration of all firearms and firearm licence holders; banned short-barrelled handguns under 105 mm in length, in addition to banning .25 and .32-calibre handguns with &quot;grandfathering&quot; for previous owners; and required a licence to buy ammunition. Most of the bill&#x27;s provisions came into force in 1998, and the registration of long guns became mandatory in 2003.
* The legislation was upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;Reference re Firearms Act&quot; (2000). The FAC system was replaced with possession-only licences (POLs) and possession and acquisition licences (PALs).

===2001 - 2019===
* In 2001, the registration portion of Bill C-68 was implemented. The government asked for all firearms, including long guns (rifles and shotguns), to be registered.
* In 2003, the registration of long guns became mandatory. Failure to register a firearm resulted in criminal charges.
* In 2006, although legislation was still in place, the government no longer asked long gun owners for a registration fee and an amnesty (until May 16, 2011) temporarily protected licensed owners of non-restricted firearms (or those whose licences had expired since January 1, 2004) from prosecution for the possession of unregistered long guns.
* In November 2009, Bill C-391 passed second reading in the House of Commons by a vote of 164 to 137. If passed through the entire parliamentary process by the House and Senate, the bill would have abolished the requirement to register non-restricted long guns. While the proposed legislation was a private member&#x27;s bill, it had the support of the Conservative government. The bill was referred to the House of Commons Committee on Public Safety for further action. However, after several months of hearings, the Opposition majority on the committee recommended that no further action be taken to advance the bill. In September 2010, Bill C-391 failed to pass a third reading.
* On October 25, 2011, Public Safety Minister Vic Toews introduced a bill to amend the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; and the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, to abolish the long gun registry and destroy all records.
* On February 15, 2012, Bill C-19 passed third reading in the House of Commons; the motion to abolish the long gun registry passed 159 to 130 and Bill C-19 became law.
* In October 2014, Public Safety Minister Stephen Blaney and the Conservatives introduced another bill, Bill C-42, also known as the &quot;Common Sense Firearms Licensing Act&quot;. This legislation reduced required paperwork for the transportation of restricted firearms, held by licensed firearms owners, for certain lawful activities (such as transportation to a shooting range and to gunsmiths or gun shows). It lifted the ban on the Swiss Arms Classic Green Carbine, introduced a six-month &quot;grace period&quot; for firearms licence renewals before an individual might otherwise face criminal charges and abolished the possession-only licence, permitting holders of such licences to enjoy the same full acquisition privileges as a PAL holders. The legislation also implemented mandatory training for all first-time firearms licence applicants. This legislation was passed and enacted in 2015, but the new Liberal government, formed in November 2015, pledged to reverse some of its provisions.
* On June 21, 2019, Bill C-71, &quot;An Act to Amend certain Acts and Regulations in relation to firearms&quot; received Royal Assent. The new legislation extended background checks from five years to a lifetime, implemented a point-of-sale registration by business, required authorization to transport restricted and prohibited firearms to locations other than the range (e.g. gunsmiths, gun shows, etc.) through strengthened transportation requirements; and, safeguard the impartial classification of firearms by putting the responsibility in the hands of technical experts, who make these determinations based on the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, among others.

===2020 - ===

* In the wake of the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on May 1, 2020, that 1,500 models of &quot;assault-style&quot; weapons, largely semi-automatic guns, would be classified as prohibited effective immediately. However, the term &quot;assault-style&quot; is not defined in Canadian law. The law granted a two-year amnesty period and provided owners with various methods to dispose, register or participate in a buyback scheme. Six weeks before the amnesty order was to come into effect the deadline was extended until October 30, 2023, so that officials could plan the confiscation program, and allow owners and businesses to remain in compliance with the law.
* On October 21, 2022, a national freeze on the sale of handguns was put in effect via an order-in-council. New handguns could no longer be bought. Existing ones could continue to be used but could not be transferred. The freeze was later codified into the &quot;Firearms Act&quot; as part of Bill C-21, which received royal assent in 2023.
* On December 1, 2024, over 300 firearms were reclassified as prohibited. This was implemented on the anniversary of the École Polytechnique massacre. The reclassification included amnesty for existing owners until at least November 2025.

==Licensing of firearms owners==
All licensing and registration is managed by the RCMP&#x27;s Canadian Firearms Program (CFP), under the Deputy Commissioner Policing Support Services (PSS). There are three classes of firearms and firearm licences: non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited. Prohibited firearms are not forbidden outright, as the name might imply, but their legal possession and acquisition are dependent upon their registration history and an individual&#x27;s firearm licence. As of December 1, 1998, the prohibited clause must be grandfathered to acquire or possess prohibited firearms. See Classification of firearms below for complete details on prohibited, restricted and non-restricted firearms.

Individuals who wish to possess or acquire firearms in Canada must have a valid possession-acquisition, or possession-only, licence (PAL/POL); either of these licences allows the licensee to purchase ammunition. The PAL is distributed exclusively by the RCMP and is generally obtained in the following three steps:
# Safety training: To be eligible to receive a PAL, all applicants must successfully complete the Canadian Firearms Safety Course (CFSC) for a non-restricted licence, and the Canadian Restricted Firearms Safety Course (CRFSC) for a restricted licence (RPAL); the non-restricted class is a prerequisite to the restricted licence. An individual must score 80% or higher to pass the courses. Each province/territory&#x27;s chief firearms officer publishes information on the locations and availability of these courses.
# Applying for a licence: Only two types of licences are available to new applicants: the possession-acquisition licence (PAL) and the restricted-class possession-acquisition licence (RPAL). People can request a PAL/RPAL by filling out Form CAFC 921.
# Security screening: enhanced background check and interviews with current and former conjugal partners, as well as interviews with two references are performed. All applicants are screened, and a mandatory 28-day waiting period is imposed on first-time applicants, but final approval time may be longer.

Licences are typically valid for five years and must be renewed prior to expiry to maintain all classes. Once licensed for restricted firearms (RPAL), an individual can request a firearm transfer for the restricted firearm; and an authorization to transport (ATT) for restricted firearms. People may hunt with firearms in Canada only with non-restricted firearms, and this requires an additional &quot;Hunting with Firearms&quot; course.

==Laws and regulations==
===Prohibited devices===
* Replica firearms (i.e., &quot;any device that is designed or intended to exactly resemble, or to resemble with near precision, a firearm, and that itself is not a firearm, but does not include any such device that is designed or intended to exactly resemble, or to resemble with near precision, an antique firearm&quot;) 
** Due to how firearms are defined in statute, airsoft replicas can be legally obtained without a licence if they have a muzzle velocity of greater than but less than , any replicas under 366 ft/s would be considered prohibited unless it is obviously a toy (e.g. made out of clear plastic or at a drastically different scale). A brightly-coloured tip (or the absence of such) has no bearing on its legality. Some provinces restrict the purchase of airsoft replicas to those who are at least 18 years of age.
* Suppressors (i.e., &quot;a device or contrivance designed or intended to reduce the perceived loudness of firearm, typically between 17-24 dB of the initial report (Murphy et.al, 2013)&quot;)
*Handgun barrels that are and under (excluding barrels of pistols used in international sporting competitions governed by the rules of the International Shooting Union)
* Electrical or mechanical devices designed or adapted to render the trigger mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm to discharge in a fully-automatic fashion
* &quot;Any rifle, shotgun or carbine stock of the type known as the &#x27;bull-pup&#x27; design, being a stock that, when combined with a firearm, reduces the overall length of the firearm such that a substantial part of the reloading action or the magazine-well is located behind the trigger of the firearm when it is held in the normal firing position&quot; (i.e., only removable stocks are prohibited by this regulation; fixed-stock firearms such as the FN PS90, Norinco Type 97 and IWI Tavor are excluded).

===Prohibited ammunition===
* Handgun ammunition designed to penetrate body armour; for example: KTW and THV round, 5.7 × 28 mm (excluding sporting rounds such as SS196SR and SS197SR).
* Incendiary or explosive ammunition designed for use in or in conjunction with a cartridge and does not exceed 15 mm in diameter.
* Flechette rounds

===Magazine capacity===

Magazines designed to contain centre-fire cartridges and designed or manufactured for use in a semiautomatic handgun are limited to 10 cartridges. Magazines designed to contain centre-fire cartridges and designed or manufactured for use in a semiautomatic rifle are limited to 5 cartridges. The capacity is measured by the kind of cartridge the magazine was designed to contain. In some cases the magazine is capable of containing more than 10 rounds of a different calibre; however, that is not relevant in the determination of the maximum permitted capacity.

The maximum permitted capacity of a magazine is determined by the kind of firearm it is designed or manufactured for and not the kind of firearm that might actually use it. As a consequence, the maximum permitted capacity remains the same regardless of which firearm it might be used in. Example: The Marlin Camp carbine chambered for .45 ACP uses magazines designed and manufactured for the M1911 pistol, therefore the seven- and eight-round capacities are permitted. A similar example is the 10-round capacity magazine for the Rock River Arms LAR-15 pistol, regardless of the kind of firearm it is actually used in.

Many common magazines are manufactured to hold more rounds than law allows in Canada. These magazines must be permanently altered so they no longer hold more than the number of rounds (5 for semi-auto rifles, 10 for pistols) allowed by law. Acceptable ways to alter a magazine are set out in the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; regulations.

===Age restrictions/Minor&#x27;s Licence===
By law, a potential customer must be 18 years of age or older to purchase a firearm (non-restricted or restricted) or legally maintain possession of one. Minors 12-17 may procure a minor&#x27;s licence, which does not allow them to purchase a firearm but allows them to borrow a non-restricted firearm unsupervised and purchase ammunition. Children under the age of 12 that are found to need a non-restricted firearm to hunt or trap may also be awarded the minor&#x27;s licence. This is generally reserved for children in remote locations, primarily aboriginal communities that engage in subsistence hunting.

===Registration===
As of January 1, 2001, all firearms in Canada were required to be registered with the Canadian Firearms Registry. Unlike restricted-class firearms, in order to legally own a fully automatic firearm in Canada the prohibited-class firearm needs to not only have a current registration but must also have been registered prior to 1978. 

The repeal of the long-gun registry had been a long-standing campaign promise of the Conservative Party. In early 2006, the Conservative Party became the largest party in the House of Commons, and the new government announced an amnesty period of one year (later extended by a further year) in which licensed or previously licensed long-gun owners would not be punished for not registering their long guns. The legal requirement to register as set forth by law was not revoked; legislation to revoke the requirement to register long guns was introduced by the government during the 39th Parliament but was not brought to a vote. It was opposed by the Opposition parties who together had a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Similar legislation was again brought forward in the form of private member&#x27;s Bill C-391 during the 40th Parliament but was narrowly defeated on September 22, 2010. During the 41st Parliament the newly formed Conservative majority government again introduced legislation to repeal the requirement to register non-restricted firearms and to destroy the registry database. Bill C-19, known as the &quot;Ending the Long-gun Registry Act&quot;, passed both the House and Senate and received royal assent on April 5, 2012. Following the 2012 changes to the law, Canadians were no longer required to register non-restricted firearms. Further, existing public records kept by the Canadian Firearms Registry with regards to owners of non-restricted firearms were purportedly expunged. The requirement for all firearms owners to possess a valid firearms licence remained law.

Though the &quot;Ending the Long-gun Registry Act&quot; applied across Canada, implementation of the law was temporarily delayed in Quebec, after the provincial government challenged the repeal in the courts. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Quebec, entirely eliminating non-restricted registry records. However, the government of Quebec received a partial copy of the deleted federal firearms registry, and created a provincial firearms registry. The government of Quebec gave residents until January 29, 2019, to register non-restricted firearms within the province with the Quebec Firearms Registration Service (SIAF).

Following the 2020 Nova Scotia attacks, the minority Liberal government under Justin Trudeau, announced a nationwide ban on &quot;military style weapons&quot; and &quot;assault-style weapons&quot;. Neither of these two classifications had existed previously under Canadian law, but the policy effectively moved around 1500 types of firearms from the restricted and non-restricted categories to the prohibited column alongside automatic long-guns. Though a buyback program is being formulated for these types of weapons, it is not currently expected to be mandatory.

===Legality of self-defence===
The issue of the legality of self-defence with a firearm in Canada has been the subject of controversy. While self-defence is legal, it is very restricted. Use of force with a firearm is legal as long as the accused can prove that their life was in danger and that the force used was not excessive. The framework for determining if an act of self-defence was legally justified is laid out in Sections 34 and 35 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;.

Obtaining a PAL for self-defence is possible, as there is no legal justification requirement for obtaining one (provided that the applicant does not pose a risk to themselves or others). However, self-defence being the primary reason for obtaining a PAL is generally discouraged and may arouse suspicion if discovered during the application process. RPALs are only issued for self-defence to those with a valid Authorization to Carry (ATC), which in turn is almost impossible to obtain.

An Authorization to Carry can only be issued for self-defence if there is credible proof that a person&#x27;s life is being actively targeted in a way which police cannot provide sufficient protection. This situation is extremely rare: the public RCMP Authorization to Carry application refers only to protection of life during employment that involves handling of valuable goods or dangerous wildlife, obtaining an ATC for self-defence would presumably require an inside contact.

==Classifications==
Like licences, firearms are classified into prohibited, restricted and non-restricted categories, as defined by Part III of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. The correct licence is required to acquire and possess the category of firearm (PAL for non-restricted, RPAL for restricted, Prohib 12.x for prohibited).

===Prohibited===
A prohibited firearm requires a prohibited-class (grandfathered) possession and acquisition licence to acquire and possess at a minimum. The licences will indicate which categories the individual or business has been grandfathered into. (12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7)
* Handguns (12.6)
** with a barrel length less than , or;
** that are designed to discharge .25 or .32 calibre ammunition (subject to exception for international sport competitions);
* Rifles and shotguns that have been altered by sawing, cutting or any other means, so that:
** the barrel length is less than (regardless of overall length), or;
** the overall length is less than 
* Firearms which have fully automatic fire capability (12.2), or &quot;converted automatics&quot; (12.3) (i.e.: firearms which were originally fully automatic, but have been modified to discharge ammunition in a semi-automatic fashion)
* Firearms prescribed as prohibited by the &quot;Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted&quot; (SOR/98-462):
** Firearm capable of discharging dart or other object carrying electric current or substance, including Taser Public Defender and any variant or modified version of it
** Firearm known as SSS-1 Stinger and any similar firearm designed or of a size to fit in the palm of the hand
** Hundreds of other firearms listed by name, including any variants or modified versions. The list includes shotguns, carbines, rifles, pistols, and submachine guns. This includes all versions (even semi-automatic) of certain military weapons such as the AK-47 and the FN-FAL.
* Firearms prescribed as prohibited by the &quot;Regulations Amending the Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and Other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited, Restricted or Non-Restricted&quot; (SOR/2020-96)
** Rifles of the designs commonly known as ArmaLite AR-10, ArmaLite AR-15, M16, M14, Robinson Armament XCR, and SIG SG 550 (including any variants or modified versions)
** Carbines of the designs commonly known as Beretta Cx4 Storm, CZ Scorpion Evo 3, M4 and SIG SG 551 (including any variants or modified versions)
** Pistols of the design commonly known as CZ Scorpion EVO 3
** Firearms with bore diameters of 20 mm or more (despite concerns expressed by some, this does not include 10 gauge and 12 gauge shotguns with removable chokes)
** Firearms that produce 10,000 joules of energy or more (including .50 BMG calibre rifles)

===Restricted===
Requires a restricted possession and acquisition licence (RPAL) to acquire and possess at a minimum. RPALs may be issued to applicants who meet one or more of the following:
* Being a member of a registered gun club
* Being able to demonstrate sufficient technical, historical or scientific knowledge of firearms one plans on owning as part of a collection
* Having a valid Authorization to Carry:
** to use a firearm as part of one&#x27;s lawful profession; or
** in exceeding rare cases where one&#x27;s life is being actively targeted to an extent where police protection is insufficient, and there is credible documentation on such

Canada&#x27;s federal laws severely restrict the ability of civilians to transport restricted or prohibited (grandfathered) firearms in public. Section 17 of the &quot;Firearms Act&quot; makes it an offence to possess prohibited or restricted firearms other than at a dwelling-house or authorized location, but there are two exceptions to this prohibition found in sections 19 and 20 of the act. Section 19 allows for persons to be issued an authorization to transport (ATT), authorizing the transport of a firearm outside the home for certain purposes, such as for its transfer to a new owner, going to and from a range, a training course, repair shop or gun show, or when the owner wishes to change the address where the firearm is stored. Such firearms must be transported unloaded, equipped with a trigger lock and stored in secure, locked containers. In rarer cases, section 20 of the act allows individuals to receive an authorization to carry, or ATC, granting permission to carry loaded restricted firearms or (section 12(6)) prohibited handguns on their persons for certain reasons specified in the act. These reasons are as follows: if the person is a licensed trapper and carries the firearm while trapping, if the person is in a remote wilderness area and needs the firearm for protection against wildlife, if the person&#x27;s work involves guarding or handling money or other items of substantial value, or if the person&#x27;s life is in imminent danger and police protection is inadequate to protect the person. This is extremely rare, data from FOI requests reveals that only around one or two permits for protection of life are ever active at any given time. The vast majority of ATCs issued are to employees of armoured car companies to allow carry of a company owned firearm only while working. Restrictions are as follows:
* All handguns are restricted firearms at a minimum; some handguns are prohibited firearms (see above).
* Any firearm that is:
** not prohibited
** that has a barrel length less than , and
** is capable of discharging centre-fire ammunition in a semi-automatic manner.

* Any firearm that can be fired when the overall length has been reduced by folding, telescoping, or other means to less than 
* Firearms prescribed as restricted by the &quot;Regulations Prescribing Certain Firearms and other Weapons, Components and Parts of Weapons, Accessories, Cartridge Magazines, Ammunition and Projectiles as Prohibited or Restricted (SOR/98-462)&quot;:
** The firearms of the designs commonly known as the High Standard Model 10, Series A shotgun and the High Standard Model 10, Series B shotgun, and any variants or modified versions of them.

===Non-restricted===
* Firearms, other than those referred to above. Generally, this includes (unless otherwise prescribed by law):
** Rimfire rifles
** Shotguns (manual, break-action and most self-loading models)
** Manual centrefire rifles
** Some long barreled, semi-automatic centrefire rifles (n.b.: most common semi-automatic models are currently prescribed as prohibited by regulation, however it is still technically possible for a firearm of this type to be non-restricted)

===Antique===
A category that includes several different categories of firearm designed before 1898, although not all firearms built before this cutoff date are eligible for antique classification. Guns considered antiques are not legally considered firearms, and can be purchased and owned without a PAL. The following types of firearm are classified as antiques if they were both designed and manufactured before 1898:
*All cartridge-firing long arms and handguns chambered in mostly obscure large-calibre rimfire cartridges, such as .32 Rimfire and .44 Henry. Handguns chambered for the former cartridge are considered non-restricted antiques even though .32 is otherwise a prohibited bore for pistols.
*All single-shot cartridge-firing centrefire rifles chambered in calibres of over , and all smoothbore shotgun conversions of such rifles regardless of calibre.
*Rimfire smoothbore shotguns in calibres other than .22.
*Centrefire cartridge handguns chambered in calibres that are no longer widely available, such as .45 Schofield.
*All muzzleloading (black powder) handguns and cap-and-ball revolvers.
The following guns are considered antiques if they were designed before 1898, regardless of manufacture date, making modern replicas free to possess:
*Non-cartridge-firing long guns which use flintlock, wheellock or matchlock ignition mechanisms.

===Handguns===
As of 2022, a national freeze was placed on the sale and transfer of handguns. However, this did not change the classification of handguns. Those who owned handguns prior to the freeze may continue to possess and use them in accordance with the law, however they cannot acquire new ones or transfer their existing ones to someone else. One may lawfully export them to another country, but they cannot be imported back in afterwards. Exceptions to the freeze include those who are authorized to carry a handgun, and those who are involved with shooting competitions organized by the International Olympic Committee or the International Paralympic Committee.

==Violent crime, suicide, and accidents==
In the years immediately following the introduction of firearms licensing in Canada in 1976, the overall homicide rate did not significantly decline. Increases were seen in the proportion of murders committed by methods other than shooting; but these homicides were less likely to involve multiple victims. From 1977 to 2003, Canada firearm homicide has declined from 1.15 to 0.5 per 100,000, while other mechanisms declined from 1.85 to 1.23 per 100,000.

A comprehensive review of firearm control legislation found that studies on the effects of the 1977 bill C-51 and bill C-68 from 1995 on firearm homicide rates came to differing conclusions, but generally found that bill C-17 from 1991 was not associated with an overall reduction of firearm homicide. A 2011 study found no significant associations between gun laws passed and firearm homicide rates in Canada from 1974 to 2008. A 2020 study examining laws passed from 1981-2016 found no significant changes in overall homicide or suicide rates following changes in legislation. In addition, it also found that firearm ownership by province was not correlated to overall suicide rates by province.

As of 2010, shooting and stabbing represented the two most common mechanisms for homicide in Canada, each accounting for approximately one-third of murders.

Overall suicide in Canada peaked in 1978 at 14.5 per 100,000, declining by 22% (11.3 per 100,000) by 2004. Several studies have found that the 1977 bill C-51 was linked to lower suicide and firearm suicide rates in Canada. Several studies examining the effect of bill C-17 (primarily using data from Quebec) found that it was associated with a decline in firearm suicides, but that the rate of overall suicides did not change, largely because of a rise in suicides due to hanging, suggesting a substitution of suicide methods.

Accidental death, of any kind, claimed 27.9 people per 100,000 in 2000. Of these, firearms accidents accounted for 0.3% (0.1 per 100,000), ranking below the 37% for transportation (10.2 per 100,000), 28% for unspecified (7.7 per 100,000), 18% for falls (5.1 per 100,000), and 11% for poisoning (3.1 per 100,000). Two studies by Leenaars and Lester using national data from 1969 to 1985 find that bill C-51 was associated with a reduced accidental death rate from firearms.

==Statistics==

The rate of firearm-related violent crime has significantly increased in the past decade, mainly due to specific violent offences involving firearms such as discharging a firearm with intent and pointing a firearm. This rate more than doubled since 2013, reaching 12.2 incidents per 100,000 people in 2022. All provinces and territories have seen growth in these crimes, with the largest increases noted in the Northwest Territories (+303%), Saskatchewan (+165%), Yukon (+149%), and New Brunswick (+126%).

Saskatchewan had the highest rate of firearm-related violent crime in 2022 at 109.6 incidents per 100,000, while Prince Edward Island had the lowest at 10.0. Regina recorded the highest percentage of such crimes among census metropolitan areas at 83.0 incidents per 100,000.

The increase was particularly prominent in territories (+139%) and rural areas (+141%). Handguns and unidentified firearm-like weapons saw the largest increases since 2013. In 2022, firearms were involved in 1.7% of injuries from violent crimes, with a higher percentage in severe cases. Most victims of firearm-related crimes were men (66%), and most accused individuals were also men (89%), although the rate of accused women rose significantly. Organized crime accounted for a higher proportion of firearm-related incidents compared to general violent crimes. The firearm-related homicide rate reached its highest since 1991 at 0.88 incidents per 100,000, primarily due to handguns.

<text>Radio Netherlands (RNW; ) was a public radio and television network based in Hilversum, producing and transmitting programmes for international audiences outside the Netherlands from 1947 to 2012.

Its services in Dutch ended on 11 May 2012. English and Indonesian language services ceased on 29 June 2012 due to steep budget cuts imposed by the Dutch government and a concomitant change in focus. The last programme broadcast on shortwave was a daily half-hour show in Spanish for Cuba named &quot;El Toque&quot; (&quot;The Touch&quot;) on 1 August 2014. 

Radio Netherlands Worldwide was replaced by RNW Media, a Dutch non profit for free speech and social change around the world.

== History ==

=== Early days (Philips Radio) ===
Following a series of experiments on various wavelengths in 1925, reports of good reception from a low-power shortwave transmitter were received from Jakarta on 11 March 1927. Dutch Queen Wilhelmina made what is believed to be the world&#x27;s first royal broadcast on 1 June 1927, addressing compatriots in the East and West Indies.

Regular international broadcast transmissions started shortly afterwards from the Philips shortwave transmitter in Eindhoven. They used the call sign &quot;PHOHI&quot; for broadcasts in the Dutch language to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), and &quot;PCJJ&quot; for broadcasts in English and other languages to the rest of the world.

The Philips company in Eindhoven saw a market for its radios in the Dutch colonies. Its research laboratories received support from companies that were trading goods between The Netherlands and Batavia (now Indonesia). The PHOHI was officially founded on 18 June 1927. In 1928, test transmissions commenced from a site in Huizen, North Holland. It was chosen because of the high water table on the land near the Zuiderzee lake (now Gooimeer). This meant there was a good conductivity for an efficient earth, which led to stronger signals in the target areas.

Around 1929, the Philips call sign was simplified to PCJ.

There were several prewar technical innovations:

The Research Laboratories continued with the development of new transmitters that could operate at shorter wavelengths and could be re-tuned for broadcasts to different parts of the world. By the end of 1936, the power had been raised by connecting a stage with two water-cooled type TA 20/250 valves. This provided a power output of 60 kW on a frequency of 15.22 MHz and immediately became the strongest short-wave transmitter in Europe. In 1937, this transmitter was moved from Eindhoven to the PHOHI Transmitter Park in Huizen.

* Broadcasts were considerably improved in 1937 with the construction of beam antennas supported by the world&#x27;s first wooden antenna masts rotatable on two concentric circular rails at the transmitter site in Huizen. In November 2006, a 1/5th size model of this antenna was officially inaugurated on a roundabout a few hundred metres from the original site.
* Rotatable curtain array antennas were not in common use until the 1960s, so PCJ was far ahead of its time with its introduction of rotatable HRS type antennas.

=== Dutch broadcasting in exile ===
Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. There were three transmitters in operation at that time. On the afternoon of May 14, the Dutch military commander gave orders that the transmitters should be destroyed, to prevent them falling into the hands of the Nazis. After several attempts, which included calling in the help of the Hilversum fire brigade, two of the three transmitters were completely destroyed. The third was only partially damaged and was later repaired and used by the Germans for pro-Nazi broadcasts, some originating from Germany. There were also relays of music concerts from Dutch broadcasters operating under German control.

The Dutch government in exile was granted air-time on BBC transmitters in 1941. The programme &quot;Radio Oranje&quot; was a daily commentary on the Dutch situation both in the Netherlands and the rest of the empire (Dutch East and West Indies). One of the chief commentators on &quot;Radio Oranje&quot;, Henk van den Broek, was given the task of restarting public broadcasting once the country was liberated.

On 3 October 1944, van den Broek travelled from London to a liberated Eindhoven and began broadcasts as &quot;Radio Herrijzend Nederland&quot;.

=== Birth of Radio Netherlands Worldwide ===
On 24 May 1945, a programme for Dutch people living abroad was transmitted with the help of the BBC. In July 1945, the Dutch government founded the &quot;Stichting Radio Nederland in den Overgangstijd&quot; (&quot;Radio Netherlands in Time of Transition&quot;) and gave it the mandate for both domestic and international broadcasts.

Later, under pressure from the pre-war Dutch broadcasting companies, the government decided to separate national and international broadcasting. On 15 April 1947, the &quot;Stichting Radio Nederland Wereldomroep&quot; (&quot;Radio Netherlands International Foundation&quot;) was established. Broadcasts in Dutch, Indonesian, English and Spanish began in that year. Subsequently, language services in Arabic and Afrikaans (1949), French (1969) and Brazilian Portuguese (1974) were added.

Radio Netherlands was editorially independent and received 6% of the Dutch annual public allocation for public broadcasting.

The interval signal of Radio Netherlands was a version of the Eighty Years&#x27; War song &quot;Merck toch hoe sterck&quot; played on a carillon. The original recording was made at the cathedral in Den Bosch. It was replaced in August 1987 by a recording of the carillon in Breda.

=== End of radio broadcasts ===
The English-language shortwave broadcasts to North America were discontinued on 26 October 2008, due to a survey that claimed that more listeners listened to RNW podcasts than listened on shortwave radio.

On 24 June 2011, the Dutch government announced a 70% cut to RNW&#x27;s budget reducing it from 46 million euros to 14 million.

On 11 May 2012 at 20:00 GMT (22:00 CEST), the Dutch service signed off at the end of a 24-hour radio marathon broadcast. This included several interviews with past staff members of the station, including the former Director General Lodewijk Bouwens. On 29 June 2012, Radio Netherlands ended broadcasting in English at 20:57 GMT (22:57 CEST) after a similar celebratory 24-hour broadcast. The final show was posted online by Jonathan Marks, the former Radio Netherlands Programme Director (1992–2003) and host of Media Network.

Since 2013, RNW&#x27;s funding had been under the responsibility of the Dutch Foreign Ministry rather than the Education and Culture Ministry.

== Shortwave relay stations ==
The shortwave international broadcasts were heard worldwide via broadcast facilities in Bonaire (opened in 1969) and Madagascar (opened in 1972). The last transmission from the shortwave relay station in Bonaire ended at 1:57 GMT on June 30, 2012, and the installations were dismantled later that year.

In 2013, the government of Madagascar and Malagasy Global Business S.A. signed an agreement to operate the Madagascar relay station in Talata-Volonondry. Among its customers are NHK Radio Japan, BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, Vatican Radio, Adventist World Radio and Free Press Unlimited.

Radio Netherlands Worldwide used a shortwave station in Flevoland from 1985 to 2007. The shortwave transmissions were supplemented by an extensive network of partner stations.

==Languages==
==Programming on the English Service==
The English-language output included news and current affairs, as well as documentaries and programmes about the Netherlands, Europe, culture, music, the media and international affairs. The station developed a reputation for providing unique, objective and high-quality public radio, garnering dozens of international awards for its productions. When the station closed down, the extensive English-language multi-media archives were deleted, but a group of former employees has made over a thousand of documentaries and radio programmes available again.

&quot;DX Juke Box&quot; was a media show that ran from 1961 with Harry van Gelder (1911–2003) and Jim Vastenhoud through to 7 May 1981, when the name and format was changed to &quot;Media Network&quot;. Jonathan Marks took over in August 1980 and re-launched the show less than one year later by adding news/topical features. He produced over 1000 editions of the programme. It became a full-time website/weblog in October 2000. The blog was discontinued in 2012 as a result of budget cuts. The Media Network archive containing around 300 of the broadcasts is available online.

&quot;Happy Station Show&quot; was another long-running popular radio show, originating on the network&#x27;s predecessors in 1928 and continued until 1995.

From 1976 until his death in 1998, Pete Myers was a prominent presenter and producer in the English section, including as a presenter of &quot;Happy Station&quot; for two years.

<doc id="450950" wikidata="Q11286385" url="?curid=450950" title="Firearms regulation in the United Kingdom">
<text>In the United Kingdom, gun ownership is considered a privilege, not a right, and access by the general public to firearms is subject to strict control measures. Members of the public may own certain firearms for the purposes of sport shooting, recreation, hunting or occupational purposes. Possession is subject to licensing. 

As of 2024, there are approximately 550,000 licensed firearm owners in Great Britain, holding approximately 2,210,000 firearms.

== Great Britain ==
=== Prohibited weapons ===
The following weapons are subject to general prohibition:

* Automatic or burst-fire firearms
* Semi-automatic or pump-action rifles other than those chambered for .22 rimfire cartridges
* Manually actuated release system rifles (MARS) and lever release rifles (not to be confused with lever action).
* Most handguns (firearms with a barrel length under or overall length under ).
* Firearms disguised as another item (e.g. walking sticks, mobile telephones, etc.).
* Rockets and mortars.
* Air guns chambered for self-contained gas cartridges. (Existing owners prior to 20 January 2004 were allowed ownership subject to obtaining a firearm certificate.)
* Any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other substance. This would generally include stun guns, or electric shock devices, CS gas (tear gas), OC spray (pepper spray), etc. Cattle prods would not generally be included, but it would depend on the type.

Firearms that previously fell into a prohibited category cannot be made legal by conversion to an otherwise permitted form. For example, a pistol which is adapted by permanently fitting a long smooth-bore barrel to it does not thereby become permitted.

=== Rifles ===
UK law does not provide a statutory definition for a &quot;rifle&quot;. Most long firearms with rifled barrels will – by default – be classified as Section 1, and can be held on a firearm certificate. This includes single-shot; bolt-action; Martini-action; lever-action (also called under-lever action); and revolver rifles in any calibre. Self-loading and pump-action rifles are only permitted in .22 rimfire calibre.

=== Handguns ===
The 1997 Acts (see below) do not ban pistols as such and are drafted in terms of &quot;short firearms&quot;.
These acts prohibit firearms with a barrel shorter than or an overall length less than In practice this includes most pistols and revolvers. Only muzzle-loading pistols (including muzzle-loading revolvers) are explicitly exempted. Small quantities of muzzle-loading pistols and revolvers in various calibres which comply with the regulations are manufactured, such as the Westlake Taurus .357 muzzle-loading revolver. All other pistols are mostly prohibited in Great Britain, with some exceptions such as pistols used for the humane dispatch of injured animals (such as deer) and some historical firearms.

This law created a new market for &quot;long-barrelled revolvers&quot; and &quot;long-barrelled pistols&quot;, firearms with a permanently attached extension to the grip, with overall dimensions larger than those prohibited. Long-barrelled pistols in single-shot, or long-barrelled revolvers, both of any calibre, or semi-automatic in .22 rimfire, are all permitted with a firearm certificate.

Pistol shooting for sporting purposes was effectively banned in 1997, although a temporary exemption was made for competitors to bring Section 5 firearms into the UK for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. This exemption only applied to the Games period and Home Nation pistol shooters had to train abroad prior to the Games. Ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games, Tessa Jowell (Minister for the Olympics) and the Home Secretary agreed to use Home Office powers to issue a small number of Section 5 permits to elite pistol shooters nominated by British Shooting. With Glasgow winning the right to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, this arrangement was extended beyond the Olympics, with a small number of UK ranges licensed for Section 5 shooting.

A few models of ISSF 50 meter pistol (also known as &quot;Free Pistol&quot;) have been produced which exceed the defined dimensions for prohibited &quot;short firearms&quot; and qualify as Section 1 firearms. Some free pistols offered removable stabiliser bars; UK-legal models are manufactured with stabilisers permanently fixed. Examples include the single-shot Pardini K22 Longarm and the five-shot Westlake Britarms Long Pistol.
Specific models of blank-firing starting pistol that are &quot;readily convertible&quot; to fire live ammunition may also be either banned or require a firearm certificate. The Bruni Olympic .380 BBM blank-firing revolver was banned in 2010 on evidence that it was being illegally converted to fire live ammunition. In October 2024, the National Crime Agency declared that Turkish-manufactured side/top venting blank-firing pistol replicas by companies such as BLOW, CEONIC, EKOL, and Retay, which were previously sold legally in the United Kingdom are officially classed as Section 5 firearms. The decision was made following several police seizures of lethally-modified blank pistols and at least 4 murders being committed using similar weapons in the past 2 years. Legal owners of such blank-firing replicas in England and Wales are expected to surrender them by February 28, 2025.

=== Shotguns ===
Single-, double-, or triple-barrelled shotguns, or those with a lever-action, bolt-action, pump-action, or semi-automatic action and fixed magazine capacity of no more than 2 cartridges are permitted on a shotgun certificate as long as they meet the criteria of having a minimum barrel length of , overall length of , and a non-detachable magazine (if present).

There is no limit on the number of guns or amount of ammunition that a shotgun certificate holder can acquire or possess at one time, although each shotgun must be recorded on the certificates.

Cartridges obtained using a shotgun certificate must have at least 5 projectiles each with a maximum size of . Other types of shotgun ammunition such as solid slugs can only be bought following the grant of a firearm certificate.

Shotguns with a detachable magazine or larger fixed magazine are considered firearms and require a firearm certificate ( rule and fixed overall length) or break action shotguns with a minimum barrel and overall fixed length.

=== Airguns ===
Airguns are firearms like any other according to the definition given in the Firearms Act 1968 at section 57(1). However, with the exception of Scotland where a certificate is now required, they are exempt from the requirement that a firearm certificate or shotgun certificate needs to be obtained to possess or acquire them provided that they meet certain limits as to their power.

Air pistols with a muzzle energy not exceeding and other airguns with muzzle energy not exceeding do not require a certificate and may be acquired, purchased and possessed by anyone over the age of 18 who is not a prohibited person as specified in section 21 of the Act, which relates to persons previously convicted of a crime.

The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 controls online or mail-order sales of airguns by way of trade or business; transactions must be finalised face-to-face, although the contract of sale may take place at a distance. The airgun may be sent by the seller to a registered firearms dealer (who will act as the seller&#x27;s agent in the sale) from whom the gun may be collected by the purchaser.

The same Act introduced the requirement that a person selling airguns or ammunition for airguns by way of trade or business be a registered firearms dealer. It is not an offence for a private individual to sell an airgun to another person as long as both parties are not legally barred from possessing airguns and the transaction does not constitute a business activity.

In 2006 it became a crime to fire an air weapon beyond the boundary of any premises without the occupier&#x27;s permission, and increased the lower age limit for buying or possessing an air weapon to 18 years.

From 10 February 2011 the Crime and Security Act 2010 (s. 46) made it an offence &quot;for a person in possession of an air weapon to fail to take reasonable precautions to prevent any person under the age of eighteen from having the weapon with him&quot;.

Any person who is in a building or is on land as a trespasser whilst having a firearm with them commits the offence of trespassing with a firearm. It is immaterial whether or not they have any ammunition with them at the time or whether they actually intend to use it at the place in which they were trespassing.

=== Ammunition ===
Explosive, incendiary, noxious (biological, chemical), and armour-piercing ammunition types are prohibited for civilians. The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 (section 9) generally prohibited expanding ammunition, but this conflicted with the Deer Act 1991 (which mandated its use for deer stalking). An exemption permitted the acquisition and possession of expanding ammunition on firearm certificates held for game shooting or deer-stalking but not target shooting. Section 219 of the Policing and Crime Act 2017 modified the 1997 Act to only apply to pistol ammunition. The distinction is no longer made for rifles and expanding ammunition may be used for target shooting. The quantity of ammunition a certificate holder may possess is determined by certificate conditions on a per-calibre basis.

Shotgun cartridges are not restricted by certificate conditions and a shotgun certificate holder may acquire and possess as many as they like. Due to their bulky nature, normal shotgun cartridges are not subject to the same secure storage requirements as section 1 ammunition. Solid slugs or cartridges containing fewer than 5 projectiles are considered section 1 and must be held on a firearm certificate.

=== Definitions ===
Section 57 of the Firearms Act 1968 defines a firearm as:
* A lethal barrelled weapon, meaning a barrelled weapon of any description from which a shot, bullet or other missile, with kinetic energy of more than 1 joule at the muzzle of the weapon, can be discharged (with an exception for airsoft guns)
* A prohibited weapon
* A relevant component part, namely a:
** Barrel, chamber or cyclinder
** Frame, body or receiver
** Breech block, bolt or other mechanism for containing the pressure of discharge at the rear of a chamber
* An accessory to a weapon where the accessory is designed or adapted to diminish the noise or flash caused by firing the weapon

Ammunition for firearms may only be possessed by the holder of a firearm certificate with authority to possess that type of ammunition. Shotgun cartridges can legally be possessed by anybody over the age of 15. No licence is required to possess such ammunition so long as the cartridges contain 5 or more shots.

The Senedd and the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate on firearms. Firearms regulation is reserved to Westminster, with the exception in Scotland of air guns since 2012.

=== Licensing ===
With a few specialised exceptions, all firearms in the United Kingdom must be licensed on either a 5-year firearm certificate (FAC) or a shotgun certificate (SGC) issued by the police for the area in which they normally reside. Each certificate can list multiple firearms.

Shotguns (Section 2 firearms under the 1968 Act as amended) are defined in UK law as smoothbore firearms with barrels not shorter than and a bore not larger than in diameter, no revolving cylinder, and either no magazine or a non-detachable magazine that is not capable of holding more than two cartridges, plus one in the chamber; shotguns with higher capacity require a firearm certificate. Shotguns thus defined are subject to a less rigorous certification process than for the full FAC; an applicant is not required by law to make a good case for being granted a certificate, but the police may withhold a certificate if they consider that the applicant does not have satisfactory security in place, or granting it would constitute a danger to public safety or to the peace. A certificate holder may possess as many shotguns as can be securely stored.

When applying for a firearm certificate, justification must be provided to the police for each firearm, and they are individually listed on the certificate by type, calibre, and serial number. A shotgun certificate similarly lists type, calibre and serial number, but permits possession of as many shotguns as can be safely accommodated. To gain permission for a new firearm, a &quot;variation&quot; must be sought, for a fee, unless the variation is made at the time of renewal, or unless it constitutes a one-for-one replacement of an existing firearm that will be disposed of. The certificate also sets out, by calibre, the maximum quantities of ammunition someone may possess at any one time, and is used to record ammunition purchases (except where ammunition is bought to use immediately on a range under s11 or s15 of the Firearms Act).

To obtain a firearm certificate, the police must be satisfied that a person has &quot;good reason&quot; to own each firearm, and that they can be trusted with it &quot;without danger to the public safety or to the peace&quot;. Under Home Office guidelines, firearm certificates are only issued if a person has legitimate sporting, collecting, or work-related reasons for ownership. Since 1968, self-defence has not been considered a valid reason to own a firearm. The current licensing procedure involves: positive verification of identity, two referees of verifiable good character who have known the applicant for at least two years (and who may themselves be interviewed and/or investigated as part of the certification), approval of the application by the applicant&#x27;s own family doctor, an inspection of the premises and cabinet where firearms will be kept and a face-to-face interview by a firearms enquiry officer (FEO), also known as a firearms liaison officer (FLO). Only when all these stages have been satisfactorily completed will a licence be issued, which must be renewed every 5 years.

Any person who has been sentenced to between three months and three years in prison is automatically prohibited from possessing firearms (including airguns) and ammunition for five years from release. A person who has been sentenced to more than three years is prohibited for life. Application may be made to a court to reverse these prohibitions and this is likely to be successful in relation to convictions for crimes which do not relate to a person&#x27;s fitness to possess firearms. Similarly, persons applying for licences with recent, serious mental health issues will also be refused a certificate.

Any person holding a firearm or shotgun certificate must comply with strict storage conditions by storing their firearms/shotguns in a safe bolted to the floor or wall that complies to the standard BS 7558:1992. These storage arrangements are checked by the police before a licence is first granted, and on every renewal of the licence.

In the case of a firearm certificate the issuing police force may impose additional conditions over and above the statutory ones. However any condition appended to a certificate must be reasonable and must not be of such a restrictive nature as would amount to a constructive refusal to grant the certificate by making use so unlikely as to be practically impossible. Failure to comply with any of these conditions can result in criminal prosecution resulting in a prison sentence of up to six months. Revocation of the certificate is also possible, depending upon the nature of the breach.

A visitor&#x27;s permit is available for possession of firearms without certificate by visitors to the UK.

The penalty for possession of any type of firearm without a certificate is a maximum of 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. The penalty for section 5 categories of firearm is subject to a mandatory minimum of five years. (The sentencing judge has discretion to depart from the minimum sentence if there are &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;.)

The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 increased restrictions on the use, possession, sale and manufacture of both airguns and imitation firearms.

=== Statistics ===
As of 31 March 2024, there were:

* In England and Wales, 147,364 firearm certificates on issue (covering 624,245 firearms), and 495,798 shotgun certificates on issue (covering 1,345,973 shotguns).
* In Scotland, 25,145 firearm certificates on issue (covering 110,343 firearms), 43,809 shotgun certificates on issue (covering 132,323 shotguns), and 31,970 air weapon certificates on issue.

=== Scotland ===
In 2006, Glasgow politician Tommy Sheridan of the political party Solidarity launched a consultation to restrict possession of air guns, highlighting recent cases including the death of toddler Andrew Morton, but the Scottish Parliament did not have the power to ban airguns at the time so any measures would have needed to be formally approved by the government of the United Kingdom. Around this time, the media gave some exposure to growing public desire to have air guns banned or regulated, particularly from the parents of a child that died after being struck in the head by a pellet in Easterhouse, a suburb of east Glasgow. The child was said to have had a skull only two millimetres thick at the point of impact.

MSPs such as Kenny MacAskill have claimed Scotland has a problem with air gun violence. However official figures show that out of the estimated 500,000 airguns in Scotland there were only 195 offences, a ratio of less than 0.04%. Not all of these offences have been linked to violence with many being minor.

The Commission on Scottish Devolution when implemented gave the Scottish Parliament powers to regulate air guns. On 14 December 2012, a consultation was launched to investigate proposals for licensing air weapons in Scotland. The Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice foreword in the consultation paper (titled &quot;Proposals for Licensing Air Weapons in Scotland&quot;) stated that the Scottish government &quot;[does] not intend to ban air weapons outright, but [does] not think that it is appropriate in our modern Scotland that there can be up to half a million unregistered, uncontrolled and often forgotten firearms in circulation&quot;. It stated an aim to &quot;ensure that only those people with a legitimate reason for owning and using an airgun should have access to them in the future, and that they are properly licensed and accounted for&quot;. In 2011/12 there were 195 offences involving air weapons in Scotland, compared to 3,554 in England and Wales. The consultation closed in March 2013 with 1,101 responses, 87% of which were opposed to the principle of licensing air weapons.
As of 31 December 2016, it is a requirement to hold an airgun certificate in Scotland to possess an air rifle with muzzle energy less than or air pistol with muzzle energy less than . There are some exceptions for current FAC and SGC holders in that they may hold an air rifle on their current certificate and apply to add it/them when next renewing their FAC or SGC.

== Northern Ireland ==
More than 100,000 people in Northern Ireland (approximately 5.7% of the population) own firearms, having 380,000 among them. Gun control laws in Northern Ireland are less restrictive in some areas than gun laws in Great Britain due to the Good Friday Agreement, allowing Northern Ireland to govern itself and pass less restrictive laws. Gun law in Northern Ireland consists primarily of the Firearms (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. Any firearm that has a muzzle energy exceeding must be listed on a firearms certificate. Northern Ireland has one firearms certificate and all firearms are listed on that certificate irrespective of type.

All firearms owners in Northern Ireland are required to apply for a firearm certificate to possess firearms. Permits are issued to anyone who has good reason to possess firearms, such as target shooting and hunting. All firearms certificate holders are required to demonstrate they can be entrusted with a firearm. It is recommended that firearms dealers selling firearms are to instruct new buyers, and those changing/acquiring another firearm, about the safety procedures for that firearm. Firearm certificate holders in Northern Ireland may transport their firearms (except handguns) to Great Britain and possess those firearms while in Great Britain due to reciprocal firearms certificate licensing arrangements.

Firearms certificate holders are limited to the number of rounds of each calibre of ammunition listed on their certificate to 1000 per listed calibre. This is a standard allowance given to every certificate holder. If a certificate holder requires a larger allowance, they must request that increase from PSNI Firearms Branch.

Semi-automatic rifles are permitted when chambered in .22 rimfire. Handguns, shotguns and air rifles are permitted in various calibres. There is currently no limit on magazine capacity for rifles or handguns. Shotguns are limited to a magazine capacity of 2 cartridges for field use. The shotgun capacity can be increased, upon application to the PSNI firearms branch, for target shooting use.

Magazines are considered a component part in Northern Ireland and a firearms certificate holder may only possess magazines for firearms listed on their certificate. As of 2021, all magazines are required to be listed on firearms certificates. This measure is PSNI Firearms Branch policy in line with EU Directive 2021/555 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons. PSNI Firearms Branch are to clarify exactly how this will take place.

A firearm certificate for a personal protection weapon will only be authorised where the Police Service of Northern Ireland deems there is a &quot;verifiable specific risk&quot; to the life of an individual and that the possession of a firearm is a reasonable, proportionate and necessary measure to protect their life. Permits for personal protection also allow the holder to carry their firearms concealed. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where personal protection is accepted as a legitimate reason to obtain and own a firearm.

== History of firearms legislation ==
The concept of legislating the use and ownership of weapons goes back at least as far as 1285 (13 Edward I) when the teaching or practice of fencing with a buckler was banned in the City of London. In 1305 the Statue of Arms stipulated the weapons that could be carried or used at a tournament of knights. This stated that not even a knight could bring a pointed sword, and his attendants were not permitted to wear or have a dagger. Throwing spears were banned in 1383 (7 Richard II c. 13.), and in 1388 servants, apprentices, and labourers were banned from wearing a sword in public except in time of war (12 Richard II c. 6.). A statute of 1511 (3 Henry VIII c. 3.) banned foreigners from having or using a longbow in England, and also banned them from taking bows or arrows out of the country. 

The first legislation to specifically mention firearms was 6 Henry VIII c. 13 (1514) that prohibited the use of hand guns by anyone who did not own land with an income of at least forty marks per year. The same rule also applied to crossbows. There was an exception if you lived on a ship, or within seven miles of the sea, or, &quot;upon any of the English Marches foranenst Scotland,&quot; when you were allowed to use a gun or crossbow to defend your home or the town. In 1522 the value of the land you had to hold was amended to £100 sterling (14 Henry VIII c. 7.), and these rules were repeated in 1533 (25 Henry VIII c. 17.).

In 1534, as a result of dissent within Wales to King Henry VIII proclaiming himself head of the Church of England, it was made illegal for any Welsh man or anyone in Wales to take a weapon of any sort, &quot;any bill, longebowe, crosbowe, handgon, swerde, staffe, daggare, halberde, morespike, speare, or any other maner of weapon,&quot; to any public assembly, fair, market, church, or meeting, or within two miles of any court (26 Henry VIII c. 6.).

By 1541 the increased variety of hand held firearms required new legislation and it was then made illegal to own any, &quot;handgun hagbutt or demy hake, or use or kepe in his or their houses or elsewhere any handgun hagbut or demy hake,&quot; unless you owned land worth more than £100 sterling. These weapons were required to be at least three feet long (91.4 cm), unless they were a &quot;hagbutt or demyhake,&quot; when the minimum length was three-quarters of a yard (68 cm). In addition, these weapons could be used only for firing at a bank of earth, a butt, or a mark, and not for shooting game (33 Henry VIII. c. 6.).

An act of 1548 (II Edward VI c. 14.) stipulated that no one less than a Lord could fire a handgun within any town or city, that hayleshot, or any other form of shot that delivered more than one pellet at a time, was banned entirely, and that anyone wishing to fire a handgun had to register with the Justice of the Peace first. The purpose of this was given as that the king might know where in the country armed men were to be found should he need them for any purpose. This is not yet gun licensing, but owner registration.

A statute of 1558 (4-5 Philip &amp; Mary I c. 2.), when England was at war with both Scotland and France, stipulated that everyone with property, including &quot;anye Honoures Lordeshipes Manours Houses Landes Meadowes Pastires or Wooddes,&quot; over certain thresholds had to provide specific numbers of horses, armour and weapons, including hagbutts, &quot;for the better furniture and defence of this Realme.&quot; Every one worth more than £1,000 sterling had to have six horses suitable for knights in armour, complete with saddle and harness, ten more horses for light cavalry, forty sets of armour, forty pikes, thirty longbows, thirty sheaves of arrows, thirty metal helmets, twenty halberds, twenty hagbutts, and twenty salets. Men with lesser amounts of property were required to provided fewer weapons, so that a man whose property was valued at £20 sterling had to provide one set of armour, one longbow with one sheaf of arrows, one steel helmet, and one hagbutt. There is no mention of whether or not these men had to be registered, but anyone living in Wales was excused finding a hagbutt, and had to replace each weapon with a longbow and sheaf of arrows. Furthermore, these hagbutts were to be used only in accordance with the existing statute (33 Henry VIII. c. 6.) and could not be carried on the public highway unless going to or from a muster or to war.

===1584–1714===
Following the assassination of William the Silent in 1584 with a concealed wheellock pistol, Queen Elizabeth I, fearing assassination by Roman Catholics, banned possession of wheellock pistols in England near a royal palace in 1594.

There were growing concerns in the 16th century over the use of guns and crossbows. Four acts were imposed to restrict their use in England and Wales.

The Militia Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 3), entitled &quot;An Act for ordering the Forces in the several Counties of this Kingdom&quot;, passed shortly after the Restoration, enabled and authorized, by warrant, local government personnel to search for and seize all arms in the custody or possession of any person or persons whom the government judged dangerous to the peace of the kingdom. It prohibited the search of rural houses during the night hours. It made it lawful in case of resistance to enter by force. Furthermore, it allowed for the restoration of seized arms.

The Bill of Rights restated the ancient rights of the people to bear arms by reinstating the right of Protestants to have arms after they had been disarmed by James II. It follows closely the Declaration of Rights made in Parliament in February 1689. The Bill of Rights text declares that &quot;the Subjects which are Protestants may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as allowed by Law&quot;.

The rights of English subjects and, after 1707, British subjects, to possess arms was recognised under English common law. Sir William Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, were highly influential and were used as a reference and text book for English common law. In his &quot;Commentaries&quot;, Blackstone described the right to arms.

Formerly, this same British common law applied to the UK and Australia, and until 1783 to the colonies in North America that became the United States. The right to keep and bear arms had originated in England during the reign of Henry II with the 1181 Assize of Arms, and developed as part of common law.

===1715–1899===
After the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745, harsh laws providing, amongst other things, for disarming the Highlands of Scotland were enacted by the Parliament of Great Britain: the Disarming Acts of 1716 and 1725 and the Act of Proscription 1746. Some high-profile assassination attempts using firearms did occur in the 19th century, such as the assassination of Spencer Perceval in 1812 and Edward Oxford&#x27;s attack on Queen Victoria in 1840, but these events led to changes in treason legislation rather than firearm controls.

The first British firearm controls were introduced as part of the Vagrancy Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 83), which was set up in a reaction against the large number of people roaming the country with weapons brought back from the Napoleonic wars. It allowed the police to arrest &quot;any person with any gun, pistol, hanger [a light sword], cutlass, bludgeon or other offensive weapon ... with intent to commit a felonious act&quot;. It was followed by the Night Poaching Acts 1828 and 1844, the Game Act 1831 (1 &amp; 2 Will. 4. c. 32), and the Poaching Prevention Act 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 114), which made it an offence to shoot game illegally by using a firearm.

The Gun Licence Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 57) was created to raise revenue. It required a person to obtain a licence to carry a gun outside his own property for any reason. A licence was not required to buy a gun. The licences cost 10 shillings (equivalent to about £31 in 2005, or £49 in November 2023), lasted one year and could be bought over the counter at Post Offices.

===Pistols Act 1903===

The Pistols Act 1903 (3 Edw. 7. c. 18) was the first to place restrictions on the sale of firearms. Titled &quot;An Act to regulate the sale and use of Pistols or other Firearms&quot;, it was short, with just nine sections, and applied solely to pistols. It defined a pistol as a firearm whose barrel did not exceed in length and made it illegal to sell or rent a pistol to anyone who could not produce a current gun licence or game licence, unless they were exempt from the Gun Licence Act 1870, could prove that they planned to use the pistol on their own property, or had a statement signed by a police officer of inspector rank or above or a justice of the peace to the effect that they were about to go abroad for six months or more. The act was more or less ineffective, as anyone wishing to buy a pistol commercially merely had to purchase a licence on demand over the counter from a Post Office before doing so. In addition, it did not regulate private sales of such firearms.

The legislators laid some emphasis on the dangers of pistols in the hands of children and drunkards and made specific provisions regarding sales to these two groups: persons under 18 could be fined 40 shillings if they bought, hired, or carried a pistol, while anyone who sold a pistol to such a person could be fined £5. Anyone who sold a pistol to someone who was &quot;intoxicated or of unsound mind&quot; was liable to a fine of £25 or 3 months&#x27; imprisonment with hard labour. However, it was not an offence under the act to give or lend a pistol to anyone belonging to the two groups.

===Firearms Act 1920===

The Firearms Act 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. 43) was partly spurred by fears of a possible surge in crime from the large number of firearms available following World War I and also fears of working-class unrest in this period. &quot;An Act to amend the law relating to firearms and other weapons and ammunition&quot;, its main stated aim was to enable the government to control the overseas arms trade and so fulfill its commitment to the 1919 Paris Arms Convention. The ongoing Anglo-Irish War may also have been a factor, as Britain and Ireland were at that time still in union with each other, and the act also applied to Ireland. It required anyone wanting to purchase or possess a firearm or ammunition to obtain a firearm certificate. The certificate, which lasted for three years, specified not only the firearm but also the amount of ammunition the holder could buy or possess. Local chief constables decided who could obtain a certificate and had the power to exclude anyone of &quot;intemperate habits&quot; or &quot;unsound mind&quot;, or anyone considered &quot;for any reason unfitted to be trusted with firearms&quot;. Applicants for certificates also had to convince the police that they had a good reason for needing a certificate. The law did not affect smooth-bore guns, which were available for purchase without any form of paperwork. The penalty for violating the act was a fine of up to £50 or &quot;imprisonment with or without hard labour for a term not exceeding three months&quot;, or both.

The right of individuals to bear arms had previously been, in the words of the 1689 Bill of Rights, &quot;as allowed by law&quot;. The Firearms Act 1920 made this right conditional upon the Home Secretary and the police. A series of classified Home Office directives defined for the benefit of chief constables what constituted good reason to grant a certificate. They originally included self-defence.

As the Firearms Act 1920 did not prevent criminals from obtaining firearms illegally, the Firearms and Imitation Firearms (Criminal Use) Act 1933 (23 &amp; 24 Geo. 5. c. 50) was passed by Parliament. It increased the punishment for the use of a gun in the commission of a crime and made it an offence punishable by up to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment for anyone to &quot;attempt to make use&quot; of any firearm or imitation firearm to resist arrest. Possession of a real or imitation firearm was also made an offence unless the possessor could show he had it for &quot;a lawful object&quot;.

===Firearms Act 1937===

The Firearms Act 1937 (1 Edw. 8 &amp; 1 Geo. 6. c. 12) incorporated various modifications to the Firearms Act 1920 based on the recommendations of a 1934 committee chaired by Sir Archibald Bodkin. The resulting legislation raised the minimum age for buying a firearm or airgun from 14 to 17, extended controls to shotguns and other smooth-bore weapons with barrels shorter than (later raised by the Firearms Act 1968 to ), transferred certificates for machine guns to military oversight, regulated gun dealers, and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual firearms certificates.

The same year, the Home Secretary declared that self-defence was no longer a suitable reason for applying for a firearm certificate and directed police to refuse such applications on the grounds that &quot;firearms cannot be regarded as a suitable means of protection and may be a source of danger&quot;.

=== Firearms Act 1968 ===
The Firearms Act 1968 (c. 27) brought together all existing firearms legislation in a single statute. Disregarding minor changes, it formed the legal basis for British firearms control policy until the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 (c. 45) was put through Parliament in the aftermath of the 1987 Hungerford massacre. For the first time, it introduced controls for long-barrelled shotguns, in the form of shotgun certificates that, like firearm certificates, were issued by an area&#x27;s chief constable in England, Scotland, and Wales. While applicants for firearms certificates had to show a good reason for possessing the firearm or ammunition, it did not apply to shotgun certificates. Firearms and ammunition had to be kept locked up in a secure place approved by the local police firearms officer.

The act also prohibited the possession of firearms or ammunition by criminals who had been sentenced to imprisonment; those sentenced to three months to three years imprisonment were banned from possessing firearms or ammunition for five years, while those sentenced to longer terms were banned for life. However, an application could be made to have the prohibition removed.

The act was accompanied by an amnesty; many older weapons were handed in to the police. It has remained a feature of British policing that from time to time a brief firearms amnesty is declared.

=== Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 ===
In the aftermath of the Hungerford massacre, Parliament passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 (c. 45). This confined semi-automatic and pump-action centre-fire rifles, military weapons firing explosive ammunition, short shotguns that had magazines, and elevated both pump-action and self-loading rifles to the Prohibited category. Registration and secure storage of shotguns held on shotgun certificates became required, and shotguns with more than a 2+1 capacity came to need a firearm certificate. The law also introduced new restrictions on shotguns. Rifles in .22 rimfire and semi-automatic pistols were unaffected.

=== Firearms (Amendment) Acts 1997 ===
Following the Dunblane massacre, the government passed the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 (c. 5) and the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997 (c. 64), defining &quot;short firearms&quot; as Section 5 prohibited weapons, which effectively banned private possession of handguns almost completely in Great Britain. Exceptions to the ban include muzzle-loading guns, pistols of historic interest (such as pistols used in notable crimes, rare prototypes, unusual serial numbers, guns forming part of a collection), guns used for starting sporting events, signal pistols, pistols that are of particular aesthetic interest (such as engraved or jewelled guns), and shot pistols for pest control. Even the UK&#x27;s Olympic shooters fell under this ban; shooters could only train in Northern Ireland (where the ban did not apply), or outside of the UK, be that in the Crown Dependencies (made up of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man), or in foreign nations (in Switzerland, in practice). Prior to the 2012 London Olympics, British Shooting negotiated an agreement with the Home Office to issue Section 5 permits to a limited number of nominated elite athletes, allowing them to keep pistols and train on the UK mainland at nominated &quot;Section 5 Ranges&quot;. This agreement was renewed following the Olympics and Section 5 permits remain on issue for eligible members of the GB squad.

162,000 pistols and of ammunition and related equipment were handed in by an estimated 57,000 people – 0.1% of the population, or one in every 960 persons. At the time, the renewal cycle for FACs was five years, meaning that it would take six years for the full reduction of valid certificates for both large-calibre and .22 handguns bans (because certificates remained valid even if the holder had disposed of all their firearms). On 31 December 1996, prior to the large-calibre handgun ban, there were 133,600 FACs on issue in England and Wales; by 31 December 1997 it had fallen to 131,900. On 31 December 2001, five years after the large calibre ban, the number had fallen to 119,600 and 117,700 the following year. This represents a net drop of 24,200 certificates. Comparable figures for Scotland show a net drop of 5,841 from 32,053 to 26,212 certificates, making a GB total net drop of 30,041. However, while the number of certificates in England and Wales rose each year after 2002 to stand at 126,400 at 31 March 2005 (due to a change in reporting period), those in Scotland remained relatively static, standing at 26,538 at 31 December 2005.

===Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006===
The Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 (c. 38) mainly impacted upon firearms legislation by creating minimum sentences for some firearms offences, regulating the sale of primers and provisions relating to imitation firearms. From 6 April 2007 the sale and transfer of new &quot;air weapons&quot; by mail order (&quot;by way of trade or business&quot;) became an offence (they may still be purchased in person), as well as the sale of primers, and realistic imitation firearms (RIFs). The only exceptions are for the purposes of military and historical reenactment, media and theatre production, paintballing, and Airsoft as a sport. This has affected Airsoft in the UK by restricting the sale, import and purchase of airsoft replicas to individuals entitled to a specific defence, e.g. members of an organised airsoft site holding permitted activities with third-party liability insurance cover or re-enactors.

===Offensive Weapons Act 2019===
At the bill stage, the Offensive Weapons Act 2019 (c. 17) proposed to amend Section 5 (Prohibited Weapons) of the 1968 act with three new classes:
* Bump stocks.
* &quot;Rapid firing&quot; MARS and lever-release rifles (not to be confused with lever action rifles, which remain legal).
* &quot;High muzzle energy&quot; firearms generating more than muzzle energy.

The prohibition on bump stocks was a reaction to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting. This had no effect on the UK legal market as most semi-automatic firearms are already prohibited and bump stocks were not commonly available. It was intended to prevent the import of such items for use with illicit firearms.

MARS and Lever release firearms were moved to s5 due to a perception that they represented a &quot;loophole&quot; around the prohibition on semi-automatic rifles and could &quot;fire rapidly&quot;. A scheme to compensate owners opened in December 2020, ahead of the prohibition coming into force in March 2021.

The final item for consideration was high muzzle energy firearms. This was intended to target rifles in .50 BMG calibre that are &quot;capable of 10,000 foot pounds [] of muzzle energy&quot;. However, this criterion would also apply to some British hunting calibres. This proposal never made the final act.

There were several proposed amendments to include further restrictions on all firearms and the licensing of airguns in England and Wales, none of which were adopted. Air weapons and high muzzle energy firearms were also part of a public consultation in December 2020. The outcome of the consultation was published in July 2022.

== Gun crime ==

The United Kingdom has one of the lowest rates of gun homicides in the world and mass shootings are extremely rare. There were 0.05 recorded intentional homicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants in the five years to 2011 (15 to 38 people per year). Gun homicides accounted for 2.4% of all homicides in the year 2011. Office for National Statistics figures show 7,866 offences in which firearms were involved in the year ending March 2015, 2% up on the previous year and the first increase in 10 years. Of these, 19 were fatalities, 10 fewer than the previous year and the lowest since records began in 1969.

===Spree killings and mass shootings===
The United Kingdom has had few spree killings or mass shootings. The most well known are the Hungerford massacre of 1987, the Dunblane school massacre of 1996, and the Cumbria shootings of 2010. After Hungerford and Dunblane, firearms legislation was amended, tightening firearms restrictions in the United Kingdom. UK gun legislation has been described by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; as &quot;one of the toughest regimes in the world&quot;. After Hungerford, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1988 criminalised most semi-automatic long-barrelled weapons; it was generally supported by the Labour opposition although some Labour backbenchers thought it inadequate. After the second incident, the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 criminalised private possession of most handguns having a calibre over .22; the Snowdrop Campaign continued to press for a wider ban, and in 1997 the incoming Labour government passed the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997. This extended the ban to most handguns with a calibre of .22, excepting antique handguns and black-powder revolvers.

====Hungerford massacre====
On 19 August 1987, 27-year-old Michael Ryan, armed with two semi-automatic rifles (a Type 56 sporter and an M1 carbine) and a Beretta 92 pistol, dressed in combat fatigues and proceeded around the town of Hungerford killing 16 people, wounding 15 and shooting himself, in what became known as the Hungerford massacre. Ryan&#x27;s collection of weapons had been legally licensed, according to the Hungerford Report.

====Dunblane massacre====

On 13 March 1996, Thomas Hamilton, a 43-year-old former scout leader who had been ousted by The Scout Association in 1974, shot dead 16 young children and their teacher, Gweneth Mayor, in Dunblane Primary School&#x27;s gymnasium with two Browning Hi-Power pistols and two Smith &amp; Wesson Model 19 revolvers. He then shot himself. There is a memorial to the 17 victims in the local cemetery and a cenotaph in the cathedral. The funds raised in the aftermath of the tragedy have been used to build a new community centre for the town.

Personnel of the Police Firearms Licensing Office were not aware of Hamilton&#x27;s expulsion by the Scout Association, nor were they aware of allegations made against him regarding unsavoury behaviour at boys&#x27; summer camps he had organised: allegations that would have exposed his poor character. The tragedy led to improvements in inter-departmental sharing of police intelligence and deeper background checks of firearm certificate applicants.

After the incident, in 1997, legislation was introduced to prohibit, with some extremely specialised exemptions, &quot;small firearms&quot; with a barrel length of less than or an overall length of less than .

====Cumbria shootings====

On 2 June 2010, Derrick Bird, a 52-year-old taxi driver, shot and killed 12 people and injured 11 others while driving through Cumbria. He then shot himself. Bird was a licensed firearms holder; his weapons were a 12-gauge double-barrelled shotgun and CZ 452-2E ZKM .22-calibre
bolt-action rifle.

====Plymouth shootings====

On 12 August 2021, 22-year-old Jake Davison, an apprentice crane operator and bodybuilding enthusiast, shot seven people, killing five including his own mother, around a residential area in the Keyham area of Plymouth in Devon. He then shot and killed himself. Davison&#x27;s motives were related to his declining mental health and quality of life. Davison considered himself to be a part of the incel movement, blaming others for his issues and hardships and would regularly vent his frustrations online. Prior to carrying out the attack, Davison posted a video rant, saying how he was &quot;beaten down&quot;.

Davison was armed with a legally held shotgun. An investigation into the events that transpired during this incident quickly revealed that Davison had previously lost his shotgun certificate after admitting to assaulting two youths at a park. He then had his firearm and firearm licence reinstated after participating in a Pathfinder programme.

The coroner&#x27;s inquest heard that firearms enquiry officers (FEO) at Devon and Cornwall Police had received no training for twenty years, and that a &quot;dangerously unsafe culture&quot; had prevailed within the Firearms Licensing Office, which was described as &quot;a dangerous shambles&quot;. On 6 October 2021, the Independent Office for Police Conduct issued disciplinary notices to two members of Devon and Cornwall Police over their handling of Davison&#x27;s shotgun certificate.

The incident prompted the Home Office to review how firearms certificates and shotgun certificates were issued. In June 2023, it was announced that a national training programme for FEOs would be introduced by 2024. Provision of appropriate role training had originally been recommended by the Cullen Inquiry into the 1996 Dunblane massacre, but had not been implemented by Police or the Home Office.

<text>WUVC-DT (channel 40) is a television station licensed to Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States, broadcasting the Spanish-language Univision network to the Research Triangle region. It is owned and operated by TelevisaUnivision alongside Raleigh-licensed low-power UniMás station WTNC-LD (channel 26). The two stations share studios on Falls of Neuse Road in Raleigh; WUVC-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located northeast of Broadway, North Carolina.

WUVC-DT is also carried on Charter Spectrum&#x27;s cable systems in the Charlotte and Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point markets.

==History==
===WKFT===
On February 26, 1980, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a construction permit to Fayetteville Television, Inc., for a new commercial television station on channel 40 in Fayetteville. The station began broadcasting as independent station WKFT on June 1, 1981; studios were located in the old First Union Bank on Donaldson Street in downtown Fayetteville and transmitted its signal from a tower in unincorporated Cumberland County on Cliffdale Road, with 1.54 million watts of power (the tower site has since been annexed into Fayetteville). Fayetteville Television was organized by Robert Warren, a former Fayetteville reporter for WRAL-TV in Raleigh, who served as WKFT&#x27;s first general manager. WKFT offered a general entertainment format consisting of cartoons, westerns, religious shows, dramas and classic sitcoms. The station put a fairly decent signal into the southern portion of the Triangle, but was harder to receive in the more densely populated areas of the market.

In 1985, the original owners sold WKFT to SJL Broadcasting, which formed Central Carolina Television to manage the station. The new owners subsequently invested about $5 million to build a new tower in Broadway, near the Harnett–Lee county line. The new transmitter, activated in June 1986, operated with a full five million watts of power. It gave channel 40 a coverage area comparable to the established Triangle stations, got the station on cable systems in the Raleigh–Durham area, and provided grade B coverage as far west as Greensboro. The station also rebranded itself as &quot;Counterforce 40&quot; and significantly upgraded its programming, competing with WLFL, the Triangle&#x27;s largest independent, which joined the upstart Fox network. However, it operated on a low budget, selling advertising mainly in the southern part of the market.

By 1989, WKFT was in dire financial straits, reportedly from debts owed to film studios for movies shown on the station. It had also failed in a bid to take the NBC affiliation from WPTF-TV (now WRDC). In November, the sale of channel 40 was announced to the Zenox Corporation for $5 million.

===WRAL on WKFT===
On December 10, 1989, an ice storm collapsed the towers of WRAL-TV and WPTF-TV near Auburn. Within hours, WKFT had reached a deal to simulcast WRAL-TV&#x27;s programming for almost all of its broadcast day as a public service. While WRAL was able to bring channel 5 back on the air before the end of the year at low power, it opted to remain on channel 40 even then in order to avoid any loss of viewership. This arrangement displaced nearly all of channel 40&#x27;s own programming. Overnight movies were added to WRAL-WKFT&#x27;s schedule in order to provide make-goods for national commercials in WKFT&#x27;s shows.

However, WRAL&#x27;s extended stay on channel 40 also provided a respite for WKFT, whose future was in limbo. SJL&#x27;s deal to sell the station to Zenox collapsed in early March. WKFT didn&#x27;t resume its own schedule until WRAL-TV returned to full power and the November sweeps book was over. WRAL, which had purchased WKFT&#x27;s tower and installed microwave equipment to add a roundup of Fayetteville news stories to its newscasts, continued a partnership with channel 40, which agreed to air any CBS programs channel 5 preempted.

While WKFT initially prepared programs for its return, SJL announced in early November that it would take channel 40 silent at the end of the month if no buyer could be found for the station, citing the striking down of must-carry regulations in 1985 and regional economic upheaval from the deployment of Fort Bragg troops ahead of the Gulf War; SJL chairman George Lilly said that the station might already have left the air if not for the unexpected revenues from the WRAL agreement. With days to go before the deadline, the station announced it would indeed remain on the air because it was nearing a deal to be sold.

===New ownership in the 1990s===
In the end, WKFT never went dark, but it was forced to declare bankruptcy on January 15, 1991, as program syndicators continued to ask for nearly $3 million in payments for future programming commitments. Exporter Elbert M. Boyd bought the station out of bankruptcy for $1.4 million. It was the first broadcasting property for Boyd and his new company, Delta Broadcasting. Under Boyd, the station turned around its finances, improved its coverage and tripled its ad rates.

After two and a half years, Boyd sold the station to Allied Communications, an investor group including several conservative-aligned figures headed by Thomas F. Ellis; the $4.4 million deal saw Boyd retain a minority stake. Allied carried out further improvements in programming and equipment; it also dropped the preempted WRAL programming, citing continued confusion over the station&#x27;s identity from the yearlong simulcast.

Bahakel Communications bought the station in 1997 for $19.5 million. As the 1990s went on, WKFT found it increasingly difficult to find stronger programming, in part because its main competitors—WLFL, WRDC, and WRAZ—had far wealthier owners and aired advertising that targeted the entire market. It lost out on bids for the Triangle WB and UPN affiliations, which went to WRAZ and WRDC respectively. The station was forced to move toward more paid programming, though it briefly served as the over-the-air home of the Carolina Hurricanes.

In December 2001, Bahakel put WKFT up for sale, alongside WBAK-TV in Terre Haute, Indiana. While it was on the block, tragedy struck again, this time affecting WKFT&#x27;s own tower. On March 14, 2002, a single-engine airplane struck the tower, causing it to collapse and leading to a fatal crash; a temporary transmitter was mounted on WRAL-TV&#x27;s tower while the Broadway site was rebuilt.

===Univision era===

Bahakel announced in December 2002 that it was selling WKFT to Univision Communications. The sale was completed in April 2003; the station changed its call sign to WUVC and network affiliation to Univision on June 1 of that year, becoming North Carolina&#x27;s first Spanish-language television station. Its English-language programming inventory was picked up by WLFL and WRDC. The station later moved from its longtime studios in downtown Fayetteville to a new facility in Raleigh.

==News operation==
In 1986, WKFT debuted a locally produced prime-time newscast at 10 p.m., which focused more on Fayetteville and the southern part of the Triangle market. The newscast was later cancelled in 1989. After Delta Broadcasting bought WKFT in 1991, news programming was reinstated, although relegated to hourly news updates. Between January 3 and April 18, 1995, WKFT produced a live noon newscast, with national segments provided by Conus Communications&#x27; All News Channel. The operation, mostly staffed by recent college graduates, also started the career of Dallas Woodhouse, who would later work at WNCN and serve as executive director of the North Carolina Republican Party. Under Bahakel, the station featured nightly news briefs between 1997 and 2001.

After becoming a Univision-owned station, on April 19, 2004, WUVC launched the first Spanish-language news operation in North Carolina, with prime time news briefs branded as . The station then expanded its programming to include a 6 p.m. newscast three nights a week. As part of an expansion of Univision&#x27;s local news operations, the station added a weeknight 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscast, titled , on August 29, 2011; it is the first Spanish-language newscast in North Carolina.

==Out-of-market cable carriage==
In recent years, WUVC has been carried on cable in multiple areas outside of the Triangle media market. That includes cable systems within the Greensboro, Greenville and Myrtle Beach, SC markets in North Carolina.

On October 16, 2013, WUVC replaced the national Univision feed on Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum)&#x27;s Charlotte-area systems. The station changed its branding from simply &quot;Univision 40&quot; to &quot;Univision 40 North Carolina&quot; (rather than &quot;Univision 40 Carolina del Norte&quot;), reflecting that it now reaches half the state via cable.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUVC ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 40, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 38, using virtual channel 40.

<text>Archibald Gavin Hamilton, Baron Hamilton of Epsom, (born 30 December 1941) is a British Conservative Party politician. A member of the House of Lords, he served as Minister of State for the Armed Forces under John Major.

==Background and education==
Hamilton is the second son of the 3rd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell, a Lord-in-waiting to the Queen. The title was created for Hamilton&#x27;s great-grandfather, John Hamilton, 1st Baron Hamilton of Dalzell, who was a Liberal politician, and was inherited by his second son, Gavin Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell, also a Liberal politician, before passing to his nephew, Hamilton&#x27;s father. His mother, Rosemary Coke, was a daughter of Major Sir John Spencer Coke, son of Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester; her maternal grandfather was Harry Lawson, 1st Viscount Burnham.

He is the younger brother of the 4th Baron Hamilton of Dalzell, and was born at Beckington Castle, Beckington, Somerset, which was then his parents&#x27; country house. He was educated at Eton College.

==Political career==
Hamilton was a Conservative councillor in Kensington and Chelsea from 1968 to 1971. He initially attempted to enter Parliament for Dagenham at the February and October 1974 elections, but was defeated by Labour&#x27;s veteran incumbent, John Parker.

He won the seat of Epsom and Ewell at a 1978 by-election. He held it until his retirement from Parliament in 2001.

During his Parliamentary career he served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Secretary of State for Energy (1979–81) and Transport (1981–82). From 1982 to 1984, he was Assistant Conservative Whip. In 1984 he became Lord Commissioner to HM Treasury, a position he held until 1986. From 1986 to 1987, Hamilton was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence.

He also served as PPS to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (1987–88), Minister of State, Ministry of Defence (Armed Forces Minister, 1988–93) and was created a Privy Councillor in 1991. He was Chairman of the 1922 Committee from 1997 to 2001.

Whilst an MP, he sat on the Standards and Privileges Committee (regarding Ethics of the Lords and Commons) in 1996. From 1994 to 1997, he also served on the Intelligence and Security Committee.

He was knighted in 1994. On 13 May 2005 it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and the peerage was gazetted on 17 June 2005 as Baron Hamilton of Epsom, of West Anstey in the County of Devon.

Since 2015, he has sat on the Joint Committee for the National Security Strategy.

==Personal life==
Hamilton is a bridge player. He is a member of the Lords bridge team and the All Party Parliamentary Bridge Group.

In 1968, he married Anne Catherine Napier (born 1940), daughter of the late Commander Trevylyan Michael Napier DSC, RN. (1901-30 August 1940) and poet and author Priscilla Hayter (1908–98), who produced books about Napier ancestors, poetry and an autobiography, &quot;A Late Beginner&quot;, which is still in print. Anne is an accomplished sculptor and painter. The couple have three daughters and six grandchildren, including Archie&#x27;s personal favourite, Arthur.

In 2006, their youngest daughter Alice Rose Alethea Hamilton married Dominic Johnson, financier, hedge fund manager, and government minister.

<text>Gun laws in Australia are predominantly within the jurisdiction of Australian states and territories, with the importation of guns regulated by the federal government. In the last two decades of the 20th century, following several high-profile killing sprees, the federal government coordinated more restrictive firearms legislation with all state governments.

Gun laws were largely aligned in 1996 by the National Firearms Agreement. In two federally funded gun buybacks and voluntary surrenders and State Governments&#x27; gun amnesties before and after the Port Arthur Massacre, more than a million firearms were collected and destroyed, possibly a third of the national stock. Since then the Agreement has continued to have support from both Labor and Coalition Federal Governments as of 2024.

A person must have a firearm licence to possess or use a firearm. Licence holders must demonstrate a &quot;genuine reason&quot; (which does not include self-defence) for holding a firearm licence and must not be a &quot;prohibited person&quot;. All firearms must be registered by serial number to the owner.

In December 2023 National Cabinet agreed to implement a national firearms register within four years.

Since the 1996 Port Arthur Massacre, Australia has implemented strict gun control measures under the National Firearms Agreement, significantly improving public safety. However, the number of registered firearms has increased by approximately 25% over nearly three decades. Concerns remain over illicit firearms, including emerging threats such as 3D-printed guns, amid limited comprehensive data on their prevalence. Efforts to strengthen firearm regulation continue in response to evolving challenges.

==National legislative structure==
Following the shooting incidents at Port Arthur in 1996 and Monash University in 2002 the Australian state and territory governments, through the then Australian Police Ministers&#x27; Council (APMC) and Council of Australian Governments (COAG), entered into three national agreements that were responsible for shaping contemporary Australian firearm laws. These agreements were the:
* National Firearms Agreement (1996)
* National Firearm Trafficking Policy Agreement (2002)
* National Handgun Control Agreement (2002).

The ownership, possession and use of firearms in Australia is regulated by state and territory laws:
* New South Wales: &quot;Firearms Act 1996&quot;, &quot;Weapons Prohibition Act 1998&quot;, and associated regulations
* Victoria: &quot;Firearms Act 1996&quot; and associated regulations
* Queensland: &quot;Weapons Act 1990&quot; and associated regulations
* Western Australia: &quot;Firearms Act 1973&quot; and associated regulations
* South Australia: &quot;Firearms Act 2015&quot; and associated regulations
* Tasmania: &quot;Firearms Act 1996&quot; and associated regulations
* Northern Territory: &quot;Firearms Act 1997&quot; and associated regulations
* Australian Capital Territory: &quot;Firearms Act 1996&quot;, &quot;Prohibited Weapons Act 1996&quot;, and associated regulations.

At the federal level, the importation of firearms is subject to the restrictions in Regulation 4F and Schedule 6 of the &quot;Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956&quot; (Cth).

== Firearms categories ==
The National Firearm Agreement defines categories of firearms, with different levels of control for each, as follows:.

;Category A: Rimfire rifles (not semi-automatic), shotguns (not pump-action, semi-automatic, or lever-action) &amp; air rifles (including semi-automatic).
;Category B: Centrefire rifles including bolt-action, pump-action and lever-action (not semi-automatic), muzzleloading firearms made after 1 January 1901 and lever-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of up to five rounds.
;Category C: Pump-action or self-loading shotguns having a magazine capacity of 5 or fewer rounds and semi-automatic rimfire rifles up to 10 rounds. Primary producers, farm workers, firearm dealers, firearm safety officers, collectors and clay target shooters can own functional Category C firearms. In Western Australia, Category C shotguns may be owned by sporting shooters who participate in practical shotgun competitions. This is generally limited to second-hand shotguns.
;Category D:All self-loading centrefire rifles, pump-action or self-loading or lever-action shotguns that have a magazine capacity of more than five rounds, semi-automatic rimfire rifles over ten rounds, are restricted to government agencies, occupational shooters and primary producers.
;Category H: Handguns can be owned for a number of &quot;genuine reasons&quot; including target shooting, occupational (security guard and prison guard), carrying on behalf of a junior, and official, commercial or prescribed purposes authorised by an Act or Regulation. For target shooters, a paid membership to an approved pistol club is mandated.
:Handguns allowed for target shooting are divided into four classes:
#Air handgun
#Rimfire handgun
#Centrefire handgun with a calibre of or less, or a black powder handgun
#Centrefire handgun with a calibre of more than .38 inch but not more than 
:The amount of shooting participation that a licensed target shooter is obliged to complete is solely determined by the number of &quot;classes&quot; of handguns that are legally &quot;owned&quot; by that person — not the actual quantity of handguns owned. A minimum number of matches is required yearly to retain ownership for each class of handgun and continue being a paid-up member of an approved pistol club, and it varies between states.
:To be eligible for a Category H Licence, a target shooter must serve a probationary period of at least 6 months and have to participate a minimum number of shooting sessions using club handguns, after which they are required to leave a fingerprint record with the police before applying for a permit. Target shooters are limited to handguns below .38 or 9mm calibers, and magazines may hold a maximum of 10 rounds. Participants in certain &quot;approved&quot; pistol competitions (currently only Single Action Shooting and Metallic Silhouette) may acquire handguns up to .45 caliber. IPSC shooting is approved for 9mm/.38/.357 SIG for handguns that meet the IPSC rules. Larger calibres such as .45 were approved for IPSC contests in Victoria in 2014. The barrel must be at least long for revolvers, and for semi-automatic pistols, unless the pistols are clearly ISSF target pistols.
:Centrefire handguns with a caliber greater than .45 are considered restricted firearms, whose ownership require a Category R/E Licence (see below).

;Category R/E: Restricted weapons include military weapons such as machine guns, rocket launchers, full automatic self-loading rifles, flamethrowers and anti-tank guns in some states.

Certain antique firearms (generally muzzleloading black powder flintlock firearms manufactured before 1 January 1901) can in some states be legally held without a licence. In other states they are subject to the same requirements as modern firearms.

In certain states, firearms that &quot;substantially duplicates military-style rifles in design, function or appearance&quot; are subjected to harsher regulations. The implication of this, which is unofficially referred to as the &quot;Appearance Law&quot;, is that any gun, regardless of the actual mechanical nature of its action, may be reclassified into Category D or R/E if it is deemed to cosmetically resemble an assault rifle.

==Licensing==
The states issue firearms licences for a legal reason, such as hunting, sport shooting, pest control, collecting and for farmers and farm workers. Licences must be renewed every 3 or 5 years (or 10 years in the Northern Territory, South Australia &amp; Queensland). Full licence-holders must be at least 18 years of age.

Junior licences in Victoria and New South Wales are available from 12 years of age (Or 11 if in Queensland), this allows the use of firearms for the purpose of receiving instruction in the use of the firearm or engaging in sport or target shooting competitions.

Licences are prohibited for convicted offenders and those with a history of mental illness. 

In May 2018 Victoria introduced firearm prohibition orders to reduce firearm related-crime by targeting those who want to possess, use or carry firearms for unlawful purposes. The person served with an order must immediately surrender any firearm or firearm related item in their possession and the firearms licence is cancelled.

Persons or companies conducting a business involving the buying, selling or trading of firearms or ammunition must obtain a firearm dealers licence, and firearms repairers must hold a firearms repairer&#x27;s licence. These must be renewed annually.

==Compliance with National Firearms Agreement==
A 2017 study commissioned by Gun Control Australia claimed that Australian states had significantly weakened gun laws since the National Firearms Agreement was first introduced, with no jurisdiction fully compliant with the Agreement. For example, many states now allow children to fire guns under strict supervision and the mandatory 28 day cooling-off period required for gun purchases has been relaxed, with no waiting period for purchasers who already own at least one gun. New South Wales also allows the limited use of moderators via a permit even though they are supposed to be a prohibited weapon. No state or territory has outlined a timeframe for achieving full compliance with the National Firearms Agreement.

A recent study Commissioned by Gun Control Australia stated that in the past 20 years, the number of hunters, sporting shooters, and licensed gun owners in Australia has declined, while the total number of firearms has increased. Despite extensive gun law reforms following the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, the number of privately owned firearms in Australia has increased. As of the latest available data, there are over four million registered firearms nationwide—25% more than in 1996—and nearly one million firearm licenses issued across states and territories. NSW has the most guns, with 1,125,553 registered firearms, followed by Queensland with 1,076,140 registered firearms. 

== History ==

=== European settlement to 19th century ===
Firearms were introduced to Australia with the arrival of the First Fleet in January of 1788, though other seafarers that visited Australia before settlement also carried firearms. The colony of New South Wales was initially a penal settlement, with the military garrison being armed. Firearms were also used for hunting, protection of persons and crops, in crime and fighting crime, and in many military engagements. From the landing of the First Fleet there was conflict with Aboriginal people over game, access to fenced land, and spearing of livestock. Firearms were used by explorers and settlers to shoot Aboriginals, often without provocation. A number of punitive raids were carried out in a series of local conflicts.

The firearms issued to convicts (for meat hunting) and settlers (for hunting and protection) were stolen and misused, resulting in more controls. In January 1796, Colonel David Collins wrote that &quot;several attempts had been made to ascertain the number of arms in the possession of individuals, as many were feared to be in the hands of those who committed depredations; the crown recalled but of between two and three hundred arms which belonged to the crown, not more than 50 were accounted for&quot;.

European-Australian colonists also used firearms in conflict with bushrangers and armed rebellions such as the 1804 Castle Hill convict rebellion and the 1854 Eureka Stockade.

===20th century===
Gun laws were the responsibility of each colony and, since Federation in 1901, of each state. The Commonwealth does not have constitutional authority over firearms, but it has jurisdiction over customs and defence matters. Federally the external affairs powers can be used to enforce internal control over matters agreed in external treaties.

In New South Wales, handguns were effectively banned after World War II but the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games sparked a new interest in the sport of pistol shooting and laws were changed to allow the sport to develop.

In some jurisdictions, individuals may also be subject to firearm prohibition orders (FPOs), which give police additional powers to search and question the individual for firearms or ammunition without a warrant. FPOs have been available in New South Wales since 1973, and are also used in Victoria.

In October 2016, it was estimated that there were 260,000 unregistered guns in Australia, 250,000 long arms and 10,000 handguns, most of them in the hands of organised crime groups and other criminals. There are 3 million registered firearms in Australia.

In March 2017, there were 915,000 registered firearms in New South Wales, 18,967 in the ACT, 298,851 in South Australia, and 126,910 in Tasmania. The other jurisdictions did not make the information public.

In 2015, there were more private firearms in Australia than there were before the Port Arthur massacre, when 1 million firearms were destroyed. Since 1988, the proportion of households with a firearm has fallen by 75%. Some of the increase may be associated with increased wild harvest of kangaroo meat. 

There has been an incremental move since the 1970s for police forces in the eight jurisdictions in Australia to routinely carry exposed firearms while on duty. In the 1970s the norm was for police to carry a baton, with only NSW police carrying firearms. Since then, police have been authorised to carry a covered firearm, and more recently to carry an exposed firearm. The shift has taken place without public debate or a proper assessment of the vulnerability of police officers, but has taken place with public acquiescence.

===1984–1996 multiple killings===
From 1984 to 1996, multiple killings aroused public concern. The 1984 Milperra massacre was a major incident in a series of conflicts between various &quot;outlaw motorcycle gangs&quot;. In 1987, the Hoddle Street massacre and the Queen Street massacre took place in Melbourne. In response, several states required the registration of all guns, and restricted the availability of self-loading rifles and shotguns. In the Strathfield massacre in New South Wales, 1991, two were killed with a knife, and five more with a firearm. Tasmania passed a law in 1991 for firearm purchasers to obtain a licence, though enforcement was light. Firearm laws in Tasmania and Queensland remained relatively relaxed for longarms.

====Port Arthur massacre====

The Port Arthur massacre took place in 1996 when the 29 year old gunman, Martin Bryant opened fire on shop owners and tourists with two semi-automatic rifles that left 35 people dead and 23 wounded. This mass killing horrified the Australian government and transformed gun control legislation in Australia.

Prime Minister John Howard pressured the states to adopt the gun law proposals made in a report of the 1988 National Committee on Violence as the National Firearms Agreement, resulting in the non-binding National Firearms Agreement (NFA) between the Commonwealth and the States &amp; Territories as the Constitution of Australia does not give the Commonwealth direct power to enact gun laws. In the face of some state resistance, Howard threatened to hold a nationwide referendum to alter the Constitution of Australia to give the Commonwealth constitutional power over guns. The National Firearms Agreement included heavy restrictions on all semi-automatic rifles and all semi-automatic and pump-action shotguns, and a system of licensing and ownership controls.

The Howard government held a series of public meetings to explain the proposed changes. At the first meeting, Howard wore a bullet-resistant vest, which was visible under his jacket. Many shooters were critical of this. Some firearm owners applied to join the Liberal Party in an attempt to influence the government, but the party barred them from membership. A court action by 500 shooters seeking admission to membership eventually failed in the Supreme Court of South Australia.

Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution of Australia requires &#x27;just terms&#x27; (financial compensation) for property that is compulsorily acquired, so the federal government introduced the &quot;Medicare Levy Amendment Act 1996&quot; to raise the predicted cost of A$500 million through a one-off increase in the Medicare levy. The &#x27;gun buy back scheme&#x27; started on 1 October 1996 and concluded on 30 September 1997. The Australian National Audit Office reported that the scheme compulsorily acquired more than 640,000 firearms, many of which were semi-automatic rifles and shotguns (restricted as a result of the 1996 legislative changes) or old, antique and dysfunctional firearms.

===Monash University shootings===

In October 2002, a commerce student killed two fellow students at Monash University in Victoria with pistols he had acquired as a member of a shooting club. The gunman, Huan Yun Xiang, was acquitted of crimes related to the shootings due to mental impairment but ordered to be detained in Thomas Embling Hospital, a high-security hospital for up to 25 years.

As in 1996, the Commonwealth Government, States and Territories agreed on a series of legislative changes known as the National Handgun Control Agreement (2002), resulting in the National Handgun Buyback Act 2003, which provided Commonwealth funding for compulsory acquisition of handguns not meeting certain technical criteria. These changes were passed by State and Territory parliaments during 2003. Changes included a 10-round magazine capacity limit, a calibre limit of not more than .38 inches (9.65 mm) (since expanded under certain criteria), a barrel length limit of not less than 120 mm (4.72 inches) for semi-automatic pistols and 100 mm (3.94 inches) for revolvers, and new shooter probation and attendance requirements for handgun target shooters. Whilst handguns for sporting shooters are nominally restricted to .38 inches as a maximum calibre, it is possible to obtain an endorsement or special permit allowing the purchase and use of pistols with calibre up to .45 inches (11.43 mm) to be used for Metallic silhouette shooting or Single Action Shooting matches.

The 2003 changes contained an option for licensed handgun target shooters to have all handguns (including those not prohibited by the 2003 changes) to be compulsorily acquired in exchange for the voluntary surrender of their Category H (Handgun) licence for a period of five years.

===2014 Sydney hostage crisis===

On 15–16 December 2014, gunman Man Haron Monis, held hostage 17 customers and employees of a Lindt chocolate café located at Martin Place in Sydney, Australia. The perpetrator was on bail at the time and had previously been convicted of a range of offences. Two of the hostages and the perpetrator died.

In August 2015, NSW Premier Mike Baird and Police Minister Troy Grant announced a tightening of laws on bail and illegal firearms, creating a new offence for the possession of a stolen firearm, with a maximum of 14 years imprisonment and establishing an Illegal Firearms Investigation and Reward Scheme. This legislative change also introduced measures to reduce illegal firearms in NSW including a ban on the possession of digital blueprints that enable firearms to be manufactured using 3D printers and milling machines for anyone without an appropriate licence.

=== Adler A110 shotgun recategorisation controversy ===
In 2015, the importation of the Adler A110 lever-action shotgun into Australia generated controversy. The firearm itself could hold up to 7+1 rounds (possible 10+1) in its magazine, a relatively high capacity for a shotgun, and its ability to deliver relatively fast follow-up shots as a lever-action firearm. Most controversially, it was a Category A firearm, making it accessible to nearly all licensed shooters. This resulted in an importation ban on A110 shotguns with a capacity over five rounds (up to five rounds was still permitted for importation). Lever-action shotguns with a magazine capacity over five rounds were later reclassified as Category D firearms.

===Gun amnesties===
There have been 28 state and territory-based amnesties since Port Arthur. The 1996 national amnesty and ‘buyback’ scheme ran for 12 months from October 1996 to September 1997 as part of the National Firearms Agreement which resulted in the removal of almost 650,000 firearms. There was also a six-month national handgun buyback in 2003 as part of the National Handgun Control Agreement (2002) resulting in the surrender of 68,727 handguns nationally

In New South Wales there have been three gun amnesties: in 2001, 2003 and 2009. 63,000 handguns were handed in during the first two amnesties and over 4,323 handguns were handed in during the third amnesty. During the third amnesty 21,615 firearm registrations were received by the Firearms Registry. The surrendered firearms were all destroyed.

Between 1 July and 30 September 2017, there was a national firearms amnesty to hand in unregistered or unwanted firearms. The amnesty had been approved in March 2017 by the Firearms and Weapons Policy Working Group (FWPWG) to reduce the number of unregistered firearms in Australia following the Lindt Cafe siege in 2014, and the 2015 shooting of an unarmed police civilian finance worker outside the New South Wales Police Force headquarters in Parramatta, Sydney.

The firearms amnesty was the first national amnesty since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. In October 2017 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that 51,000 unregistered firearms were surrendered during the three-month amnesty, of the previous estimate of 260,000 unregistered guns.

It has been estimated that, as at 2017, there were 3,158,795 firearms in private hands in Australia, of which 414,205 were unregistered. This represents 14.5 firearms per 100 people.

In July 2021, the Federal Government introduced a permanent gun amnesty.

==Efficacy measurement==
===Trends in related social problems===

Some studies on the effects of Australia&#x27;s gun laws have suggested that Australia&#x27;s gun laws have been effective in reducing mass shootings, gun suicides and armed crime, while other studies suggest that the laws have had little effect. Polling shows strong support for gun legislation in Australia with around 85 to 90% of people wanting the same or greater level of restrictions. Nevertheless, conservative estimates are that there may be about 260,000 unregistered or prohibited firearms in the community, including assault rifles.

Between 1991 and 2001, the number of firearm-related deaths in Australia declined by 47%. Suicides committed with firearms accounted for 77% of these deaths, followed by firearms homicide (15%), firearms accidents (5%), firearms deaths resulting from legal intervention and undetermined deaths (2%). The number of firearms suicides was in decline consistently from 1991 to 1998, two years after the introduction of firearm regulation in 1996.

Suicide deaths using firearms more than halved in ten years, from 389 deaths in 1995, to 147 deaths in 2005. This is equal to 7% of all suicides in 2005. Over the same period, suicides by hanging increased by over 52% from 699 in 1995 to 1068 in 2005.

The number of guns stolen fell from an average 4,195 per year from 1994 to 2000 to 1,526 in 2006–2007. Long guns are more often stolen opportunistically in home burglaries, but few homes have handguns and a substantial proportion of stolen handguns are taken from security firms and other businesses; only a small proportion, 0.06% of licensed firearms, are stolen in a given year. A small proportion of those firearms are reported to be recovered. About 3% of these stolen weapons are later connected to an actual crime or found in the possession of a person charged with a serious offence. As of 2011 and 2012, pistols and semi-automatic pistols were traded on the black market for ten to twenty thousand dollars.

===Research===

In 1981, Richard Harding, after reviewing Australian and other data at that time, said that &quot;whatever arguments might be made for the limitation or regulation of the private ownership of firearms, suicide patterns do not constitute one of them. &quot; He quoted a 1968 international analysis of 20 developed countries &quot;cultural factors appear to affect suicide rates far more than the availability and use of firearms. Thus, suicide rates would not seem to be readily affected by making firearms less available&quot;. In 1985, he supported laws to restrict gun ownership in New South Wales, saying contributions to slowing the growth of the Australian gun inventory are to be welcomed.

In 1997, the Prime Minister, John Howard appointed the Australian Institute of Criminology to monitor the effects of the gun buyback. The institute has published a number of papers reporting trends and statistics around gun ownership and gun crime.

In 2002, Jenny Mouzos from the Australian Institute of Criminology examined the rate of firearm theft in Australian states in territories following the firearm regulation. She found that &quot;the NFA... is having the desired effect: securely stored firearms are proving less vulnerable to theft.&quot;

In 2003, researchers from the Monash University Accident Research Centre examined firearm deaths and mortality in the years before and after firearm regulation. They concluded that there was &quot;dramatic&quot; reduction in firearm deaths and especially suicides due to &quot;the implementation of strong regulatory reform&quot;.

In 2005, Don Weatherburn of the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research stated that the 1996 legislation had little to no effect on violence saying the &quot;laws did not result in any acceleration of the downward trend in gun homicide.&quot;

Multiple studies have been conducted by Jeanine Baker and Samara McPhedran, researchers with the International Coalition for Women in Shooting and Hunting (WiSH). In 2006 their paper on the 1996 firearms legislation in the &quot;British Journal of Criminology&quot; used an ARIMA analysis and found little evidence for an impact of the laws on homicide, but did for suicide. Don Weatherburn described the article as &quot;reputable&quot; and &quot;well-conducted&quot; but also stated that &quot;it would be wrong to infer from the study that it does not matter how many guns there are in the community.&quot; Simon Chapman stated the article ignored the Mass Shootings issue such as the Port Arthur Massacre. In 2012, McPhedran and Baker found there was little evidence for any impacts of the gun laws on firearm suicide among people under 35 years of age, and suggested that the significant financial expenditure associated with Australia&#x27;s firearms method restriction measures may not have had any impact on youth suicide. In 2008 McPhedran compared the incidence of mass shootings in Australia and New Zealand. The authors&#x27; conclude that &quot;if civilian access to certain types of firearms explained the occurrence of mass shootings in Australia then New Zealand would have continued to experience mass shooting events&quot;.

In 2006, Weatherburn noted the importance of actively policing illegal firearm trafficking and argued that there was little evidence that the new laws had helped in this regard.

A 2006 study coauthored by Simon Chapman concluded: &quot;Australia&#x27;s 1996 gun law reforms were followed by more than a decade free of fatal mass shootings, and accelerated declines in firearm deaths, particularly suicides. Total homicide rates followed the same pattern. Removing large numbers of rapid-firing firearms from civilians may be an effective way of reducing mass shootings, firearm homicides and firearm suicides.&quot;

In 2007, a meta-analysis published in the Australian Medical Association&#x27;s &quot;The Medical Journal of Australia&quot; researched nationwide firearm suicides. They said that the analysis was consistent with the hypothesis that &quot;measures to control the availability of firearms... have resulted in a decline in total suicide rates&quot; and recommended further reduction in the availability of lethal means.

A 2008 study on the effects of the firearm buybacks by Wang-Sheng Lee and Sandy Suardi of University of Melbourne and La Trobe University studied the data and concluded &quot;the NFA did not have any large effects on reducing firearm homicide or suicide rates.&quot;

In 2009, a study published in the &quot;Journal of Sociology&quot; examined the rate of firearm suicide in Queensland. They found that &quot;gun suicides are continuing to decrease in Queensland&quot; and that this is &quot;most likely as a function of ongoing gun controls&quot;.

In 2009, another paper from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention at Griffith University also studied suicide in Queensland only, concluding: &quot;No significant difference was found in the rate pre/post the introduction of the NFA in Queensland; however, a significant difference was found for Australian data, the quality of which is noticeably less satisfactory.&quot;

A 2010 study by Christine Neill and Andrew Leigh found the 1997 gun buyback scheme reduced firearm suicides by 74% while having no effect on non-firearm suicides or substitution of method.

In 2011, many studies have followed, providing varying results stemming from different methodologies and areas of focus. David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis of Harvard University, funded by the Joyce Foundation, summarised the research in 2011 and concluded: “it would have been difficult to imagine more compelling future evidence of a beneficial effect.” They said that a complication in evaluating the effect of the NFA was that gun deaths were falling in the early 1990s. They added that everyone should be pleased with the &quot;immediate, and continuing, reduction&quot; in firearm suicide and firearm homicide following the NFA.

In a 2013 report from the Australian Institute of Criminology, Samantha Bricknell, Frederic Lemieux and Tim Prenzler compared mass shootings between America and Australia and found the &quot;1996 NFA coincided within the cessation of mass shooting events&quot; in Australia, and that there were reductions in America that were evident during the 1994–2004 US Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

A 2014 report stated that approximately &quot;260,000 guns are on the Australian &#x27;grey&#x27; or black markets&quot;, and discussed the potential problem of people using 3D printers to create guns. NSW and Victorian police obtained plans to create 3D printed guns and tested to see if they could fire, but the guns exploded during testing.

A 2015 journal article in the &quot;International Review of Law and Economics&quot; evaluated the effect of the National Firearms Agreement on overall crime, rather than just firearm deaths like other studies. Using the difference in differences identification approach, they found that after the NFA, &quot;there were significant decreases in armed robbery and attempted murder relative to sexual assault&quot;.

In 2016, four researchers evaluated the National Firearms Agreement after 20 years in relation to mental health. They said that the &quot;NFA exemplifies how firearms regulation can prevent firearm mortality and injuries.&quot;

In 2016, a study by Adam Lankford, associate professor of criminal justice, examined the links between public mass shootings and gun availability in various countries. He found that the restrictions in Australia were effective, concluding that &quot;in the wake of these policies, Australia has yet to experience another public mass shooting.&quot;

A 2017 oral presentation published in &quot;Injury Prevention&quot; examined the effect of the NFA on overall firearm mortality. They found that the NFA decreased firearm deaths by 61% and concluded that &quot;Australian firearm regulations indeed contributed to a decline in firearm mortality.&quot; After this study, these researchers were reported in the Journal of Experimental Criminology in connection with another study with Charles Branas at Columbia University which concluded; &quot;Current evidence showing decreases in firearm mortality after the 1996 Australian national firearm law relies on an empirical model that may have limited ability to identify the true effects of the law.&quot;

In January 2025, a report by the Australia Institute found that on average, firearm license holders in Australia own more than four guns, with some individuals possessing significantly higher numbers, including two in suburban Sydney who each own over 300 firearms. Surveys indicate that three in four Australians support limits on individual firearm ownership. A report on the issue recommends strengthening gun regulations nationwide, addressing emerging concerns such as 3D-printed firearms. Detailed firearm data and jurisdictional breakdowns are available in Gun Control in Australia.

==Major players==
===Federal government===
Until 1996, the Australian federal government had little role in firearms law. Following the Port Arthur massacre, the Howard government (1996–2007), with strong media and public support, introduced uniform gun laws with the cooperation of all the states, brought about through threats to Commonwealth funding arrangements. Then Prime Minister John Howard frequently referred to the United States to explain his opposition to civilian firearms ownership and usage in Australia, stating that he did not want Australia to go &quot;down the American path&quot;. In one interview on Sydney radio station 2GB, Howard said, &quot;We will find any means we can to further restrict them because I hate guns... ordinary citizens should not have weapons. We do not want the American disease imported into Australia.&quot; In 1995 Howard, as opposition leader, had expressed a desire to introduce restrictive gun laws.

In his autobiography &quot;Lazarus Rising: A Personal and Political Autobiography&quot;, Howard expressed his support for the anti-gun cause and his desire to introduce restrictive gun laws long before he became prime minister. In a television interview shortly before the 10th anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre, he reaffirmed his stance, &quot;I did not want Australia to go down the American path. There are some things about America I admire and there are some things I don&#x27;t. And one of the things I don&#x27;t admire about America is their... slavish love of guns. They&#x27;re evil.&quot; During the same television interview, Howard also stated that he saw the outpouring of grief in the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre as &quot;an opportunity to grab the moment and think about a fundamental change to gun laws in this country&quot;.

The National Firearms Agreement has had continuing support from both Labor and Coalition governments.

In March 2018, Victorian Police were set to be armed with military-style semi-automatic rifles to combat terrorism and the increase in gun-related crime.

=== Political parties ===
The Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party is a political party that started in New South Wales claims to be &quot;the voice of hunters, shooters, fishers, rural and regional Australia and independent thinking Australians everywhere. Advocating for the politically incorrect, a voice of reason, science and conservation&quot;. Its founder, John Tingle, served as an elected member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1995 until he retired in late 2006. , the party holds two seats in the NSW Legislative Council and three seats in the Legislative Assembly. The party holds one seat in the Western Australian Legislative Council, having won the seat at the 2013 Western Australian state election. The party also holds one seat in the Victorian Legislative Council, having won the seat at the 2018 Victorian state election.

A number of minor political parties such as the Libertarian Party, Country Alliance and Katter&#x27;s Australian Party (represented in the House of Representatives by Bob Katter, who is the father-in-law of Robert Nioa, the CEO of Australia&#x27;s largest private firearm supplier NIOA) have platforms advocating lawful civilian ownership of firearms.

The One Nation Party in 199798 briefly gained national prominence and had strong support from shooters. In March 2019, One Nation was the subject of a two-part Al Jazeera documentary series alleging that the party was soliciting financial assistance from the National Rifle Association of America and Koch Industries in order to change Australian gun control laws. Al Jazeera used an undercover reporter posing as a gun rights advocate. In response, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson condemned the documentary as a Qatar hit piece and announced that she had filed a complaint with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Similar sentiments were echoed by the One Nation officials, James Ashby and Steve Dickson, who were featured in the documentary. In response to the documentary, the Australian Electoral Commission said that none of the activities shown in the documentary violated section 326 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 since they occurred overseas.

===Pro-gun organisations===
Shooting clubs have existed in Australia since the mid-19th century. They are mainly concerned with protecting the viability of hunting, collecting and target shooting sports. Australian shooters regard their sport as under permanent threat from increasingly restrictive legislation. They argue that they have been made scapegoats by politicians, the media, and anti-gun activists for the acts of criminals who generally use illegal firearms. Their researchers have found scant evidence that increasing restrictions have improved public safety, despite the high costs and severe regulatory barriers imposed on shooters in Australia.

The largest organisation of firearms owners is the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (SSAA) which was established in 1948, and as at 2015 had 175,000 members. SSAA state branches lobby on local issues, while SSAA National addresses federal legislation and international issues. SSAA National has non-government organisation (NGO) status at the United Nations and is a founding member of The World Forum on the Future of Sport Shooting Activities (WFSA), which also has NGO status. SSAA National has a number of people working in research and lobbying roles. In 2008, they appointed journalist and media manager Tim Bannister as federal parliamentary lobbyist. 
SSAA argues that there is no evidence that gun control restrictions in 1987, 1996 and 2002 had any impact on the already established trends. Also, responding to Neill and Leigh, SSAA said that 93% of people replaced their seized firearms with at least one, to replace their surrendered firearms.

The Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia (SIFA) was established in 2014 as the &quot;peak body in research, advocacy, education and safety for one of our country’s oldest and most innovative industries&quot; serving to &quot;represent more effectively the social, cultural, economic and environmental impact of the many thousands of Australians who work in the industry and aligned industries like agriculture, tourism, conservation and ethical harvest&quot;. Its board members are directors from Australia&#x27;s five largest firearm importers/suppliers — NIOA, Raytrade, Outdoor Sporting Agencies (OSA), Winchester Australia and Beretta Australia. During 2017 Queensland state election, SIFA contributed to a political campaign called &quot;Flick &#x27;em&quot;, aimed at diverting the votes of major parties and electing a hung government more in favour of relaxing the gun law. SIFA also contributed significantly in the &quot;Not.Happy.Dan&quot; campaign against incumbent Victorian state premier Daniel Andrews during the 2018 Victorian state election.

For handguns, one major organisation in Australia is Pistol Australia. There are several other national bodies, such as Field and Game Australia, the National Rifle Association of Australia, IPSC Australia Inc, the Australian Clay Target Association and Target Rifle Australia. These national bodies with their state counterparts concentrate on a range of sporting and political issues ranging from Olympic-type competition through to conservation activities.

===Anti-gun organisations===

The National Coalition for Gun Control (NCGC) had a high profile in the public debate up to and immediately after the Port Arthur massacre. Rebecca Peters, Roland Browne, Simon Chapman and Reverend Tim Costello appeared in media reports and authored articles to support their aims. In 1996, the NCGC had received the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&#x27;s Community Human Rights award.

In 2003, Samantha Lee as chair of the NCGC was financed by a Churchill Fellowship to publish a paper arguing that current handgun legislation is too loose, that police officers who are shooters have a conflict of interest, and that licensed private firearm ownership &quot;per se&quot; presents a threat to women and children.

In a late 2005 press release, Roland Browne as co-chair of the NCGC, advocated further restrictions on handguns.

On 26 August 2013, NCGC was incorporated into Gun Control Australia (GCA) in New South Wales as an association advocating for stronger gun laws, run by volunteer lawyers, public health academics and social media experts. The organisation is funded by community donations and is not affiliated with any political party. Its Chair is Samantha Lee and Vice President Roland Browne. Both Samantha Lee and Roland Browne are lawyers who have volunteered in the area of gun control for over ten years.

===Public opinion===
In 2015, Essential Research performed a poll regarding the support for Australia&#x27;s gun laws. The demographic-normalised poll found that 6% of Australians thought the laws were &quot;too strong&quot;, 40% thought &quot;about right&quot; and 45% thought &quot;not strong enough&quot;. Essential Research repeated the poll a year later and found the responses had not changed. It also found these views were consistent regardless of political party voting tendency for Labor, Coalition or Greens voters.

<text>There are two primary opposing ideologies regarding private firearm ownership in the United States.

Advocates of gun control support increasingly restrictive regulations on gun ownership, while proponents of gun rights oppose such restrictions and often support the liberalization of gun ownership. These groups typically differ in their interpretations of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as in their views on the role of firearms in public safety, their impact on public health, and their relationship to crime rates at both national and state levels.

Since the early 21st century, private firearm ownership in the United States has been steadily increasing, with a notable acceleration during and after 2020.

The survey also indicates a rise in the diversity of firearm owners, with increased ownership rates among females and ethnic minorities compared to previous years.

==History==

Firearms in American life begin with the earliest attempts to settle and colonize the United States. Firearms were made, imported and provided for agrarian, hunting, defense and diplomatic purposes. A connection between shooting skills and survival among American men in the colonial expanses was often a necessity, and could serve as a &#x27;rite of passage&#x27; for those entering manhood. Today, the figures of the settler colonist, hunter and outdoorsman survive as central to American gun culture, regardless of modern trends away from hunting and rural life.

Prior to the American Revolution, there was neither the ability nor political desire to maintain a standing army in the American colonies. Since at least the time of the Glorious Revolution, English political ideology was strongly opposed to the idea of a standing army. Therefore, the armed citizen-soldier carried responsibility. Service in colonial militia, including providing one&#x27;s own ammunition and weapons, was mandatory for all men. Yet, as early as the 1790s, the mandatory universal militia duty evolved gradually to voluntary militia units and a reliance on a regular army. Throughout the 19th century the institution of the organized civilian militia gradually declined. The unorganized civilian militia under current U.S. law consists of all able-bodied males at least seventeen years of age and under the age of 45—with some exceptions—who are not members of the National Guard or Naval Militia, as codified in .

Closely related to the militia tradition is the frontier tradition, with the need for self-protection pursuant to westward expansion and the extension of the American frontier. Though it has not been a necessary part of daily survival for over a century, &quot;generations of Americans continued to embrace and glorify it as a living inheritanceas a permanent ingredient of this nation&#x27;s style and culture&quot;.
Since the founding-era of American Federalist politics, debates regarding firearm availability and gun violence in the United States have been characterized by concerns about the right to bear arms, as found in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the responsibility of the United States government to serve the needs of its citizens and to prevent crime and deaths. Firearms regulation supporters say that indiscriminate or unrestricted gun rights inhibit the government from fulfilling that responsibility, and causes a safety concern. Gun rights supporters promote firearms for self-defense – including security against tyranny, as well as hunting and sporting activities. Gun control advocates state that restricting and tracking gun access would result in safer communities, while gun rights advocates state that increased firearm ownership by law-abiding citizens reduces crime and assert that criminals have always had easy access to firearms.
Gun legislation in the United States has become increasingly subject to federal judicial interpretation of the Constitution. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads: &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot; In 1791, the United States adopted the Second Amendment, and in 1868 adopted the Fourteenth Amendment. The historical tradition bounded by these two amendments has been the subject of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; (2008), where the Court affirmed for the first time that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to possess firearms for traditionally lawful purposes (such as self-defense within the home), independent of service in a state militia, in &quot;McDonald v. City of Chicago&quot; (2010), where the Court ruled that the Second Amendment&#x27;s restrictions are incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thereby apply to state as well as federal law, and most recently in the &quot;NYSRPA v. Bruen&quot; (2022). As emphasized in &quot;Bruen&quot;, the Second Amendment makes an &quot;unqualified command&quot; that the &quot;individual-right&quot; of firearms ownership, as opposed to the collective or militia-based theory of the right, is protected from all restriction unless a government authority can demonstrate their law is with the Nation&#x27;s historical tradition of firearms regulation.

In 2018 it was estimated that U.S. civilians own 393 million firearms, and that 40% to 42% of the households in the country have at least one gun. However, record gun sales followed in the following years. The U.S. has by far the highest estimated number of guns per capita in the world, at 120.5 guns for every 100 people.

===Colonial era through the Civil War===
In the summer of 1619 in Jamestown, Virginia, leaders of the settlement came together to pass the first gun law:
In the years prior to the American Revolution, the British, in response to the colonists&#x27; unhappiness over increasingly direct control and taxation of the colonies, imposed a gunpowder embargo on the colonies in an attempt to lessen the ability of the colonists to resist British encroachments into what the colonies regarded as local matters. Two direct attempts to disarm the colonial militias fanned what had been a smoldering resentment of British interference into the fires of war.

These two incidents were the attempt to confiscate the cannon of the Concord and Lexington militias, leading to the Battles of Lexington and Concord of April 19, 1775, and the attempt, on April 20, to confiscate militia powder stores in the armory of Williamsburg, Virginia, which led to the Gunpowder Incident and a face-off between Patrick Henry and hundreds of militia members on one side and the Royal Governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, and British seamen on the other. The Gunpowder Incident was eventually settled by paying the colonists for the powder.

According to historian Saul Cornell, states passed some of the first gun control laws, beginning with Kentucky&#x27;s law to &quot;curb the practice of carrying concealed weapons in 1813.&quot; There was opposition and, as a result, the individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment began and grew in direct response to these early gun control laws, in keeping with this new &quot;pervasive spirit of individualism.&quot; As noted by Cornell, &quot;Ironically, the first gun control movement helped give birth to the first self-conscious gun rights ideology built around a constitutional right of individual self-defense.&quot;

The individual right interpretation of the Second Amendment first arose in &quot;Bliss v. Commonwealth&quot; (1822), which evaluated the right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state pursuant to Section 28 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799). The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state was interpreted as an individual right, for the case of a concealed sword cane. This case has been described as about &quot;a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons [that] was violative of the Second Amendment&quot;.

The first state court decision relevant to the &quot;right to bear arms&quot; issue was &quot;Bliss v. Commonwealth&quot;. The Kentucky court held that &quot;the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire...&quot;

Also during the Jacksonian Era, the first collective right (or group right) interpretation of the Second Amendment arose. In &quot;State v. Buzzard&quot; (1842), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based, political right, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, &quot;that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense&quot;, while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons.

The Arkansas high court declared &quot;That the words &#x27;a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State&#x27;, and the words &#x27;common defense&#x27; clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Arkansas and the U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms.&quot; Joel Prentiss Bishop&#x27;s influential &quot;Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes&quot; (1873) took Buzzard&#x27;s militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized as the &quot;Arkansas doctrine,&quot; as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law.

The two early state court cases, &quot;Bliss&quot; and &quot;Buzzard&quot;, set the fundamental dichotomy in interpreting the Second Amendment, i.e., whether it secured an individual right versus a collective right.

===Post Civil War===


In the years immediately following the Civil War, the question of the rights of freed slaves to carry arms and to belong to the militia came to the attention of the federal courts. In response to the problems freed slaves faced in the Southern states, the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted.

When the Fourteenth Amendment was drafted, Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio used the Court&#x27;s own phrase &quot;privileges and immunities of citizens&quot; to include the first Eight Amendments of the Bill of Rights under its protection and guard these rights against state legislation.

The debate in Congress on the Fourteenth Amendment after the Civil War also concentrated on what the Southern States were doing to harm the newly freed slaves. One particular concern was the disarming of former slaves.

The Second Amendment attracted serious judicial attention with the Reconstruction era case of &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot; which ruled that the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not cause the Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, to limit the powers of the State governments, stating that the Second Amendment &quot;has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the national government.&quot;

Akhil Reed Amar notes in &quot;The Yale Law Journal&quot;, the basis of common law for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which would include the Second Amendment, &quot;following John Randolph Tucker&#x27;s famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist Haymarket affair case, &quot;Spies v. Illinois&quot;&quot;:

===20th century===
====First half of 20th century====
Since the late 19th century, with three key cases from the pre-incorporation era, the U.S. Supreme Court consistently ruled that the Second Amendment (and the Bill of Rights) restricted only Congress, and not the States, in the regulation of guns. Scholars predicted that the Court&#x27;s incorporation of other rights suggested that they may incorporate the Second, should a suitable case come before them.

=====National Firearms Act=====

The first major federal firearms law passed in the 20th century was the National Firearms Act (NFA) of 1934. It was passed after Prohibition-era gangsterism peaked with the Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day massacre of 1929. The era was famous for criminal use of firearms such as the Thompson submachine gun (Tommy gun) and sawed-off shotgun. Under the NFA, machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, and other weapons fall under the regulation and jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) as described by Title II.

=====&quot;United States v. Miller&quot;=====

In &quot;United States v. Miller&quot; (1939) the Court did not address incorporation, but whether a sawn-off shotgun &quot;has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia.&quot; In overturning the indictment against Miller, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas stated that the National Firearms Act of 1934, &quot;offend[ed] the inhibition of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.&quot; The federal government then appealed directly to the Supreme Court. On appeal the federal government did not object to Miller&#x27;s release since he had died by then, seeking only to have the trial judge&#x27;s ruling on the unconstitutionality of the federal law overturned. Under these circumstances, neither Miller nor his attorney appeared before the Court to argue the case. The Court only heard argument from the federal prosecutor. In its ruling, the Court overturned the trial court and upheld the NFA.

====Second half of 20th century====

The Gun Control Act of 1968 (GCA) was passed after the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy, and African-American activists Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. The GCA focuses on regulating interstate commerce in firearms by generally prohibiting interstate firearms transfers except among licensed manufacturers, dealers, and importers. It also prohibits selling firearms to certain categories of individuals defined as &quot;prohibited persons.&quot;

In 1986, Congress passed the Firearm Owners Protection Act. It was supported by the National Rifle Association because it reversed many of the provisions of the GCA. It also banned ownership of unregistered fully automatic rifles and civilian purchase or sale of any such firearm made from that date forward.

The assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981 led to enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Law) in 1993 which established the national background check system to prevent certain restricted individuals from owning, purchasing, or transporting firearms. In an article supporting passage of such a law, retired chief justice Warren E. Burger wrote:

Americans also have a right to defend their homes, and we need not challenge that. Nor does anyone seriously question that the Constitution protects the right of hunters to own and keep sporting guns for hunting game any more than anyone would challenge the right to own and keep fishing rods and other equipment for fishingor to own automobiles. To &#x27;keep and bear arms&#x27; for hunting today is essentially a recreational activity and not an imperative of survival, as it was 200 years ago. &#x27;Saturday night specials&#x27; and machine guns are not recreational weapons and surely are as much in need of regulation as motor vehicles.

A Stockton, California, schoolyard shooting in 1989 led to passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 (AWB or AWB 1994), which defined and banned the manufacture and transfer of &quot;semiautomatic assault weapons&quot; and &quot;large capacity ammunition feeding devices.&quot;

According to journalist Chip Berlet, concerns about gun control laws along with outrage over two high-profile incidents involving the ATF (Ruby Ridge in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993) mobilized the militia movement of citizens who feared that the federal government would begin to confiscate firearms.

Though gun control is not strictly a partisan issue, there is generally more support for gun control legislation in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party. The Libertarian Party, whose campaign platforms favor limited government regulation, is outspokenly against gun control.

=====Advocacy groups=====
The National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded to promote firearm competency and natural conservation in 1871. The NRA supported the NFA and, ultimately, the GCA. After the GCA, more strident groups, such as the Gun Owners of America (GOA), began to advocate for gun rights. According to the GOA, it was founded in 1975 when &quot;the radical left introduced legislation to ban all handguns in California.&quot; The GOA and other national groups like the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and its offshoot the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC), Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership (JPFO), and the Second Amendment Sisters (SAS), often take stronger stances than the NRA and criticize its history of support for some firearms legislation, such as GCA. The National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) has been an outspoken critic of the NRA for a number of years. According to the Huffington Post, &quot;NAGR is the much leaner, more pugnacious version of the NRA. Where the NRA has looked to find some common ground with gun reform advocates and at least appear to be reasonable, NAGR has been the unapologetic champion of opening up gun laws even more.&quot; These groups believe any compromise leads to greater restrictions.

According to the authors of &quot;The Changing Politics of Gun Control&quot; (1998), in the late 1970s, the NRA changed its activities to incorporate political advocacy. Despite the impact on the volatility of membership, the politicization of the NRA has been consistent and the NRA-Political Victory Fund ranked as &quot;one of the biggest spenders in congressional elections&quot; as of 1998. According to the authors of &quot;The Gun Debate&quot; (2014), the NRA taking the lead on politics serves the gun industry&#x27;s profitability. In particular when gun owners respond to fears of gun confiscation with increased purchases and by helping to isolate the industry from the misuse of its products used in shooting incidents.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence began in 1974 as Handgun Control Inc. (HCI). Soon after, it formed a partnership with another fledgling group called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns (NCBH) – later known as the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV). The partnership did not last, as NCBH generally took a tougher stand on gun regulation than HCI. In the wake of the 1980 murder of John Lennon, HCI saw an increase of interest and fundraising and contributed $75,000 to congressional campaigns. Following the Reagan assassination attempt and the resultant injury of James Brady, Sarah Brady joined the board of HCI in 1985. HCI was renamed in 2001 to Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

=====Centers for Disease Control (CDC) restriction=====
In 1996, Congress added language to the relevant appropriations bill which required &quot;none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.&quot; This language was added to prevent the funding of research by the CDC that gun rights supporters considered politically motivated and intended to bring about further gun control legislation. In particular, the NRA and other gun rights proponents objected to work supported by the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, then run by Mark L. Rosenberg, including research authored by Arthur Kellermann.

===21st century===

In October 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report on the effectiveness of gun violence prevention strategies that concluded &quot;Evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of any of these laws.&quot; A similar survey of firearms research by the National Academy of Sciences arrived at nearly identical conclusions in 2004. In September of that year, the Assault Weapons Ban expired due to a sunset provision. Efforts by gun control advocates to renew the ban failed, as did attempts to replace it after it became defunct.

The NRA opposed bans on handguns in Chicago, Washington D.C., and San Francisco while supporting the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (also known as the School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act), which strengthened requirements for background checks for firearm purchases. The GOA took issue with a portion of the bill, which they termed the &quot;Veterans&#x27; Disarmament Act.&quot;

Besides the GOA, other national gun rights groups continue to take a stronger stance than the NRA. These groups include the Second Amendment Sisters, Second Amendment Foundation, Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, and the Pink Pistols. New groups have also arisen, such as the Students for Concealed Carry, which grew largely out of safety-issues resulting from the creation of gun-free zones that were legislatively mandated amidst a response to widely publicized school shootings.

In 2001, in &quot;United States v. Emerson&quot;, the Fifth Circuit became the first federal appeals court to recognize an individual&#x27;s right to own guns. In 2007, in &quot;Parker v. District of Columbia&quot;, the D.C. Circuit became the first federal appeals court to strike down a gun control law on Second Amendment grounds.

====Smart guns====
Smart guns only fire when in the hands of the owner, a feature gun control advocates say eliminates accidental firings by children, and the risk of hostile persons (such as prisoners, criminal suspects, an opponent in a fight, or an enemy soldier) grabbing the gun and using it against the owner. Gun rights advocates fear mandatory smart gun technology will make it more difficult to fire a gun when needed.

Smith &amp; Wesson reached a settlement in 2000 with the administration of President Bill Clinton, which included a provision for the company to develop a smart gun. A consumer boycott organized by the NRA and NSSF nearly drove the company out of business and forced it to drop its smart gun plans.

The New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law of 2002 requires that 30 months after &quot;personalized handguns are available&quot; anywhere in the United States, only smart guns may be sold in the state.

Some gun safety advocates worry that by raising the stakes of introducing the technology, this law contributes to the opposition that has prevented smart guns from being sold anywhere in the United States despite availability in other countries.

In 2014, a Maryland gun dealer dropped plans to sell the first smart gun in the United States after receiving complaints.

====&quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;====

In June 2008, in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, the Supreme Court upheld by a 5–4 vote the &quot;Parker&quot; decision striking down the D.C. gun law. &quot;Heller&quot; ruled that Americans have an individual right to possess firearms, irrespective of membership in a militia, &quot;for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.&quot; However, in delivering the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia argued that the operative clause of the amendment, &quot;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed,&quot; codifies an individual right derived from English common law and codified in the English Bill of Rights (1689). The majority held that the Second Amendment&#x27;s preamble, &quot;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,&quot; is consistent with this interpretation when understood in light of the framers&#x27; belief that the most effective way to destroy a citizens&#x27; militia was to disarm the citizens. The majority also found that &quot;United States v. Miller&quot; supported an individual-right rather than a collective-right view, contrary to the dominant 20th-century interpretation of that decision. (In Miller, the Supreme Court unanimously held that a federal law requiring the registration of sawed-off shotguns did not violate the Second Amendment because such weapons did not have a &quot;reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia.&quot;) Finally, the court held that, because the framers understood the right of self-defense to be &quot;the central component&quot; of the right to keep and bear arms, the Second Amendment implicitly protects the right &quot;to use arms in defense of hearth and home.&quot;

The four dissenting justices said that the majority had broken established precedent on the Second Amendment, and took the position that the Amendment refers to an individual right, but in the context of militia service.

====&quot;McDonald v. City of Chicago&quot;====

In June 2010, a Chicago law that banned handguns was struck down. The 5–4 ruling incorporated the Second Amendment, stating that &quot;The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States.&quot; Justice Samuel Alito&#x27;s plurality opinion attributed incorporation to the Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause.

====&quot;New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen&quot;====

In June 2022, the Supreme Court struck down the Sullivan Act&#x27;s requirement for New York residents to show proper cause to obtain a license for concealed carry of handguns. The Supreme Court&#x27;s 6-3 majority opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas rejected a two-part test previously used by federal courts to review challenges to gun-control measures. It found that carrying a handgun in public for self-defense is protected under the Second Amendment, while still allowing for restrictions on carrying handguns in certain &quot;sensitive places.&quot; The opinion however only allows for &quot;sensitive place&quot; restrictions where historical analogues may be present (such as schools, courthouses, and polling places), using the island of Manhattan as an example of one such sensitive place that would be considered unconstitutional.

====Advocacy groups, PACs, and lobbying====
One way advocacy groups influence politics is through &quot;outside spending,&quot; using political action committees (PACs) and 501(c)(4) organizations. PACs and 501(c)(4)s raise and spend money to affect elections. PACs pool campaign contributions from members and donate those funds to candidates for political office. Super PACs, created in 2010, are prohibited from making direct contributions to candidates or parties, but influence races by running ads for or against specific candidates. Both gun control and gun rights advocates use these types of organizations.

The NRA&#x27;s Political Victory Fund super PAC spent $11.2 million in the 2012 election cycle, and as of April 2014, it had raised $13.7 million for 2014 elections. Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s gun-control super PAC, Independence USA, spent $8.3 million in 2012 and $6.3 million in 2013. Americans for Responsible Solutions, another gun-control super PAC started by retired Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, raised $12 million in 2013, and planned to raise $16 to $20 million by the 2014 elections. The group&#x27;s treasurer said that the funds would be enough to compete with the NRA &quot;on an even-keel basis.&quot;

Another way advocacy groups influence politics is through lobbying; some groups use lobbying firms, while others employ in-house lobbyists. According to OpenSecrets, gun politics groups with the most lobbyists in 2013 were: the NRA&#x27;s Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA); Mayors Against Illegal Guns (MAIG); the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF); and the Brady Campaign. Gun rights groups spent over $15.1 million lobbying in Washington D.C. in 2013, with the National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR) spending $6.7 million, and the NRA spending $3.4 million. Gun control groups spent $2.2 million, with MAIG spending $1.7 million, and the Brady Campaign spending $250,000 in the same period.

====3D printed firearms====

In August 2012, an open source group called Defense Distributed launched a project to design and release a blueprint for a handgun that could be downloaded from the Internet and manufactured using a 3D printer. In May 2013, the group made public the STL files for the world&#x27;s first fully 3D printable gun, the Liberator .380 single shot pistol.
Since 2018, 3D printed gun files have exponentially multiplied and been freely published on the Internet for anyone in the world to access, on websites like DEFCAD and Odysee.

====Proposals made by the Obama administration====
On January 16, 2013, in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and other mass shootings, President Barack Obama announced a plan for reducing gun violence in four parts: closing background check loopholes; banning so-called &quot;assault weapons&quot; and &quot;large capacity magazines&quot;; making schools safer; and increasing access to mental health services. The plan included proposals for new laws to be passed by Congress, and a series of executive actions not requiring Congressional approval. No new federal gun control legislation was passed as a result of these proposals. President Obama later stated in a 2015 interview with the BBC that gun control:

has been the one area where I feel that I&#x27;ve been most frustrated and most stymied, it is the fact that the United States of America is the one advanced nation on earth in which we do not have sufficient common-sense, gun-safety laws. Even in the face of repeated mass killings. And you know, if you look at the number of Americans killed since 9/11 by terrorism, it&#x27;s less than 100. If you look at the number that have been killed by gun violence, it&#x27;s in the tens of thousands. And for us not to be able to resolve that issue has been something that is distressing. But it is not something that I intend to stop working on in the remaining 18 months.

====2013 United Nations Arms Treaty====

The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is a multilateral treaty that regulates the international trade in conventional weapons, which entered into force on December 24, 2014. Work on the treaty commenced in 2006 with negotiations for its content conducted at a global conference under the auspices of the United Nations from July 2–27, 2012, in New York. As it was not possible to reach an agreement on a final text at that time, a new meeting for the conference was scheduled for March 18–28, 2013. On April 2, 2013, the UN General Assembly adopted the ATT. The treaty was opened for signing on June 3, 2013, and by August 15, 2015, it had been signed by 130 states and ratified or acceded to by 72. It entered into force on December 24, 2014, after it was ratified and acceded to by 50 states.

On September 25, 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry signed the ATT on behalf of the Obama administration. This was a reversal of the position of the Bush administration which had chosen not to participate in the treaty negotiations. Then in October a bipartisan group of 50 senators and 181 representatives released concurrent letters to President Barack Obama pledging their opposition to ratification of the ATT. The group was led by Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) and Representatives Mike Kelly (R-Pennsylvania) and Collin Peterson (D-Minnesota). Following these two letters, four Democratic senators sent a separate letter to the President stating that &quot;because of unaddressed concerns that this Treaty&#x27;s obligations could undermine our nation&#x27;s sovereignty and the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans [they] would oppose the Treaty if it were to come before the U.S. Senate.&quot; The four Senators are Jon Tester (D-Montana), Max Baucus (D-Montana), Heidi Heitkamp (D-North Dakota), and Joe Donnelly (D-Indiana).

Supporters of the treaty claim that the treaty is needed to help protect millions around the globe in danger of human rights abuses. Frank Jannuzi of Amnesty International USA states, &quot;This treaty says that nations must not export arms and ammunition where there is an &#x27;overriding risk&#x27; that they will be used to commit serious human rights violations. It will help keep arms out of the hands of the wrong people: those responsible for upwards of 1,500 deaths worldwide every day.&quot; Secretary Kerry was quoted as saying that his signature would &quot;help deter the transfer of conventional weapons used to carry out the world&#x27;s worst crimes.&quot; As of December 2013, the U.S. has not ratified or acceded to the treaty.

==== Proposals made by the Trump administration ====
Following the Las Vegas shooting in October 2017 and the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018, President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice (DOJ) sought ways to ban bump stocks, devices that can be used to make semi-automatic weapons fire as fully automatic ones as used in both shootings. Initially, the DOJ believed it had to wait for Congress to pass the appropriate legislation to ban the sale and possession of bump stocks. However, by March 2018, the DOJ introduced proposed revised regulations on gun control that incorporated bump stocks under the definition of machine guns, which would make them banned devices, as Congress had not yet taken any action. After a period of public review, the DOJ implemented the proposed ban starting on December 18, 2018, giving owners of bump stocks the option to either destroy them or turn them into authorities within 90 days, after which the ban would be in full effect (on March 26, 2019). Pro-gun groups immediately sought to challenge the order, but could not get the Supreme Court to put the ban on hold while the litigation was ongoing. In the following week, the Supreme Court refused to exempt the litigants in the legal challenge from the DOJ&#x27;s order after this was raised as a separate challenge.

==== Proposals made by the Biden administration ====

Since his election, President Joe Biden urged Congress to pass a ban on assault rifles and other measures.

In April 2022, the President announced plans to crack down on privately made firearms, saying that they have become &quot;weapons of choice for many criminals.&quot; From 2016 to 2021, the number of suspected privately made firearms recovered in criminal investigations increased tenfold, with about 20,000 suspected privately made firearms reported to ATF in 2021. The 2022 Justice Department decision restricted the sale of weapons parts kits (determining the kits, which can be assembled into firearms in a little as 20 minutes, to qualify as &quot;firearms&quot; within the definition of the federal Gun Control Act, thus requiring serial numbers and licensure of manufacturers and commercial sellers). U.S. district judge in Texas, Reed O&#x27;Connor, blocked the rule, finding that it exceeded the department&#x27;s authority and issuing a nationwide injunction. The U.S. has appealed to the Fifth Circuit.

On June 25, 2022, President Biden signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, which included expanded background checks for firearm purchasers under the age of 21, $15 billion in funding for mental health programs and school security upgrades, federal funding to encourage states to implement red flag laws, and gun ownership bans for individuals convicted of domestic abuse charges.

==Public opinion==


===Polls===
&quot;Huffington Post&quot; reported in September 2013 that 48% of Americans said gun laws should be made more strict, while 16% said they should be made less strict and 29% said there should be no change. Similarly, a Gallup poll found that support for stricter gun laws has fallen from 58% after the Newtown shooting, to 49% in September 2013. Both the Huffington Post poll and the Gallup poll were conducted after the Washington Navy Yard shooting. Meanwhile, the Huffington Post poll found that 40% of Americans believe stricter gun laws would prevent future mass shootings, while 52% said changing things would not make a difference. The same poll also found that 57% of Americans think better mental health care is more likely to prevent future mass shootings than stricter gun laws, while 29% said the opposite. 74% of those who incorrectly believed that the USA has universal background checks supported stricter gun laws, but 89% of those who thought that such checks were not universally required supported stricter laws.

In a 2015 study conducted by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, state gun laws were examined based on various policy approaches, and were scored on grade-based and ranked scales. States were rated positively for having passed stricter measures and stronger gun laws. Positive points were also given for states that required background checks on all sales of firearms and that limited bulk firearms purchases, and that prohibited sales of assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, and that carried out stricter evaluations of applications for handgun concealed-carry licenses, especially in the context of prohibited domestic-violence offenders. Meanwhile, points were deducted from states with laws that expanded access to guns, or that allowed concealed carry in public areas (particularly schools and bars) without a permit, or that passed &quot;Stand Your Ground Laws&quot; – which remove the duty to retreat and instead allow people to shoot potential assailants. Eventually, states were graded indicating the overall strengths or weakness of their gun laws. The ten states with the strongest gun laws ranked from strongest starting with California, then New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Hawaii, New York, Maryland, Illinois, Rhode Island and finally Michigan. The states with weakest gun laws were ranked as follows: South Dakota, Arizona, Mississippi, Vermont, Louisiana, Montana, Wyoming, Kentucky, Kansas, and Oklahoma. A comparable study of state laws was also conducted in 2016. Based on these findings, The Law Center concluded that comprehensive gun laws reduce gun violence deaths, whereas weaker guns laws increase gun-related deaths. Furthermore, among different kinds of legislation, universal background checks were the most effective at reducing gun-related deaths.

=== Media depictions and public opinion ===
A study conducted by Berryessa et al. in 2020 with 3410 qualifying respondents investigated how characteristics of victims and types of incidents described in a media report would affect respondents&#x27; support towards gun regulations. They found that mentions of victim race, particularly those of Black victims, was a strong predictor of lowered support for all categories of firearm regulation. Furthermore, regulations designed to address gun deaths from suicide and accidents were less likely to garner support compared to those addressing mass shootings or street-level gun homicide. Descriptions of age, mental illness, prior incarceration, and victim gender were less salient predictors of public support than those of race or incident type.

==Political arguments==
===Rights-based arguments===
Rights-based arguments involve the most fundamental question about gun control: to what degree the government has the authority to regulate guns.

Proponents of gun rights include but are not limited to the following:
:National Rifle Association
:Second Amendment Foundation
:Gun Owners of America
:American Rifle &amp; Pistol Association
:National Association for Gun Rights
:Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC)
:Pink Pistols
:The Well-Armed Woman
:Evolve USA
:Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership
:National African American Gun Association
:California Rifle &amp; Pistol Association
:Socialist Rifle Association
:Redneck Revolt

====Fundamental right====

The primary author of the United States Bill of Rights, James Madison, considered the rights contained within– including a right to keep and bear arms – to be fundamental. In 1788, he wrote: &quot;The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with the national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion.&quot;

The view that gun ownership is a fundamental right was affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; (2008). The Court stated: &quot;By the time of the founding, the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects.&quot; The Court observed that the English Bill of Rights of 1689 had listed a right to arms as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.

When the Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment in &quot;McDonald v. City of Chicago&quot; (2010), it looked to the year 1868, when the amendment was ratified and said that most states had provisions in their constitutions explicitly protecting this right. The Court concluded: &quot;It is clear that the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.&quot;

====Second Amendment rights====

The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, adopted on December 15, 1791, states:

A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.

Prior to &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, in the absence of a clear court ruling, there was a debate about whether or not the Second Amendment included an individual right. In &quot;Heller&quot;, the Court concluded that there is indeed such a right, but not an unlimited one. Although the decision was not unanimous, all justices endorsed an individual right viewpoint but differed on the scope of that right.

Before &quot;Heller&quot; gun rights advocates argued that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to own guns. They stated that the phrase &quot;the people&quot; in that amendment applies to individuals rather than an organized collective and that the phrase &quot;the people&quot; means the same thing in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th Amendments. They also said the Second&#x27;s placement in the Bill of Rights defines it as an individual right. As part of the &quot;Heller&quot; decision, the majority endorsed the view that the Second Amendment protects an individual, though not unlimited, right to own guns. Political scientist Robert Spitzer and Supreme Court law clerk Gregory P. Magarian argued that this final decision by the Supreme Court was a misinterpretation of the U.S. Constitution.

After the &quot;Heller&quot; decision there was an increased amount of attention on whether or not the Second Amendment applies to the states. In 2010 in the case of &quot;McDonald v. City Chicago&quot;, the Supreme Court ruled that the Second Amendment&#x27;s provisions do apply to the states as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment.

====Defense of self and state====

The eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone (b. 1723), whose writings influenced the drafters of the U.S. Constitution, called self-defense &quot;the primary law of nature&quot; which (he said) man-made law cannot take away. Following Blackstone, the American jurist St. George Tucker (b. 1752) wrote that &quot;the right of self-defense is the first law of nature; in most governments, it has been the study of rulers to confine this right within the narrowest limits possible.&quot;

In both &quot;Heller&quot; (2008) and &quot;McDonald&quot; (2010) the Supreme Court deemed that the right of self-defense is at least partly protected by the United States Constitution. The court left details of that protection to be worked out in future court cases.

The two primary interest groups regarding this issue are the Brady Campaign and the National Rifle Association. They have clashed, for example, regarding stand-your-ground laws which give individuals a legal right to use guns for defending themselves without any duty to retreat from a dangerous situation. After the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2008 decision in &quot;Heller&quot;, the Brady Campaign indicated that it would seek gun laws &quot;without infringing on the right of law-abiding persons to possess guns for self-defense.&quot;

==== Protection of marginalized people ====
Left-wing and far-left advocates for gun rights argue that gun ownership is necessary for protecting marginalized communities, such as African Americans and the working class, from state repression. Far-left advocates argue that gun control laws mostly benefit white people and harm people of color.

====Security against tyranny====
Another fundamental political argument associated with the right to keep and bear arms is that banning or even regulating gun ownership makes government tyranny more likely. A January 2013 Rasmussen Reports poll indicated that 65 percent of Americans believe the purpose of the Second Amendment is to &quot;ensure that people are able to protect themselves from tyranny.&quot; A Gallup poll in October 2013 showed that 60 percent of American gun owners mention &quot;personal safety/protection&quot; as a reason for owning them, and 5 percent mention a &quot;Second Amendment right,&quot; among other reasons. Another poll, published by the Pew Research Center in August 2023, confirms these results: 72% of polled gun owners state that self-protection is a major reason for their gun ownership. The anti-tyranny argument extends back to the days of colonial America and earlier in Great Britain.

Various gun rights advocates and organizations, such as former governor Mike Huckabee, former Congressman Ron Paul, and Gun Owners of America, say that an armed citizenry is the population&#x27;s last line of defense against tyranny by their own government. This belief was also familiar at the time the Constitution was written. The Declaration of Independence mentions &quot;the Right of the People to alter or to abolish&quot; the government, and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s first inaugural address reiterated the &quot;revolutionary right&quot; of the people. A right of revolution was not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution; instead, the Constitution was designed to ensure a government deriving its power from the consent of the governed. Historian Don Higginbotham wrote that the well-regulated militia protected by the Second Amendment was more likely to put down rebellions than participate in them.

Gun rights advocates such as Stephen Halbrook and Wayne LaPierre support the &quot;Nazi gun control&quot; theory. The theory states that gun regulations enforced by the Third Reich rendered victims of the Holocaust weak, and that more effective resistance to oppression would have been possible if they had been better armed. Other gun laws of authoritarian regimes have also been brought up such as gun control in the Soviet Union and in China. This counterfactual history theory is not supported by mainstream scholarship, though it is an element of a &quot;security against tyranny&quot; argument in U.S. politics.

American gun rights activist Larry Pratt says that the anti-tyranny argument for gun rights is supported by successful efforts in Guatemala and the Philippines to arm ordinary citizens against communist insurgency in the 1980s. Gun-rights advocacy groups argue that the only way to enforce democracy is through having the means of resistance. Militia-movement groups cite the Battle of Athens (Tennessee, 1946) as an example of citizens who &quot;[used] armed force to support the Rule of Law&quot; in what they said was a rigged county election. Then-senator John F. Kennedy wrote in 1960 that, &quot;it is extremely unlikely that the fears of governmental tyranny which gave rise to the Second Amendment will ever be a major danger to our nation...&quot;

In 1957, the legal scholar Roscoe Pound expressed a different view: He stated, &quot;A legal right of the citizen to wage war on the government is something that cannot be admitted. ... In the urban industrial society of today, a general right to bear efficient arms so as to be enabled to resist oppression by the government would mean that gangs could exercise an extra-legal rule which would defeat the whole Bill of Rights.&quot;

===Public policy arguments===

Public policy arguments are based on the idea that the central purpose of government is to establish and maintain order. This is done through public policy, which Blackstone defined as &quot;the due regulation and domestic order of the kingdom, whereby the inhabitants of the State, like members of a well-governed family, are bound to conform their general behavior to the rules of propriety, good neighborhood, and good manners, and to be decent, industrious, and inoffensive in their respective stations.&quot;

====Gun violence debate====
The public policy debates about gun violence include discussions about firearms deaths – including homicide, suicide, and unintentional deaths – as well as the impact of gun ownership, criminal and legal, on gun violence outcomes. After the Sandy Hook shooting, the majority of people, including gun owners and non-gun owners, wanted the government to spend more money in order to improve mental health screening and treatment, to deter gun violence in America. In the United States in 2009 there were 3.0 recorded intentional homicides committed with a firearm per 100,000 inhabitants. The U.S. ranks 28 in the world for gun homicides per capita. A U.S. male aged 15–24 is 70 times more likely to be killed with a gun than their counterpart in the eight (G-8) largest industrialized nations in the world (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, Russia). In 2013, there were 33,636 gun-related deaths, in the United States. Meanwhile, in the same year of Japan, there were only 13 deaths that were involved with guns. In incidents concerning gun homicide or accidents, a person in America is about 300 times more likely to die than a Japanese person. In 2015, there were 36,252 deaths due to firearms, and some claim as many as 372 mass shootings, in the U.S., while guns were used to kill about 50 people in the U.K. More people are typically killed with guns in the U.S. in a day (about 85) than in the U.K. in a year.

Within the gun politics debate, gun control and gun rights advocates disagree over the role that guns play in crime. Gun control advocates concerned about high levels of gun violence in the United States look to restrictions on gun ownership as a way to stem the violence and say that increased gun ownership leads to higher levels of crime, suicide and other negative outcomes. Gun rights groups say that a well-armed civilian populace prevents crime and that making civilian ownership of firearms illegal would increase the crime rate by making civilians vulnerable to criminal activity. They say that more civilians defend themselves with a gun every year than the law enforcement arrest for violent crimes and burglary and that civilians legally shoot almost as many criminals as law enforcement officers do.

Studies using FBI data and Police Reports of the incidents, have found that there are approximately 1,500 verified instances of firearms used in self-defense annually in the United States. Survey-based research derived from data gathered by the National Crime Victimization Survey has generated estimates that, out of roughly 5.5 million violent crime victims in the U.S. annually approximately 1.1 percent, or 55,000 used a firearm in self-defense (175,000 for the 3-year period.) When including property crimes, of the 15.5 million victims of property crimes annually found in the survey (46.5 million for 2013–2015), the NCV survey data yielded estimates that around 0.2 percent of property crime victims, or 36,000 annually (109,000 for the 3-year period) used a firearm in self-defense from the loss of property. Researchers working from the most recent NCVS data sets have found approximately 95,000 uses of a firearm in self-defense in the U.S. each year (284,000 for the years 2013–2015). In addition, the United States has a higher rate of firearm ownership than any other nation. The United States&#x27; gun homicide rate, while high compared to other developed nations, has been declining since the 1990s.
Gun control has limited the availability of firearms to many individuals. Some of the limitations include any persons who have been dishonorably discharged from the military, any person that has renounced their United States citizenship, has been declared mentally ill or committed to a mental institution, is a fugitive, is a user or addicted to a controlled substance, and anyone illegally in the country. Still, in 2016, according to the Center for Disease Control, there were 19,362 homicides in the United States. Firearms were used in 14,415 or a little over 74% of all homicides. There were also 22,938 suicides that were performed with the assistance of a firearm. In total, in 2016, firearms were involved in the deaths of 38,658 Americans. According to Rifat Darina Kamal and Charles Burton, in 2016, study data, presented by Priedt (2016), showed that just the homicide rate, by itself, was 18 times greater than the rates of Australia, Sweden, and France. Due to the increase in mass shootings, in the United States, new laws are being passed. Recently, Colorado became the fifteenth state to pass the &quot;Red Flag&quot; bill which gives judges the authority to remove firearms from those believed to be a high risk of harming others or themselves. This &quot;Red Flag&quot; law has now been proposed in twenty-three states.

====Criminal violence====

There is an open debate regarding a causal connection (or the lack of one) between gun control and its effect on gun violence and other crimes. The numbers of lives saved or lost by gun ownership are debated by criminologists. Research difficulties include the difficulty of accounting accurately for confrontations in which no shots are fired and jurisdictional differences in the definition of &quot;crime.&quot;

Such research is also subject to a more fundamental difficulty affecting all research in this field: the effectiveness of the Criminal Law in preventing crime in general or in specific cases is inherently and notoriously difficult to prove and measure, and thus issues in establishing a causal link between gun control or particular gun control policies and violent crime must be understood to be an aspect of a more general empirical difficulty, which pervades the fields of Criminology and Law at large. It is not simple, for example, to prove a causal connection between the laws against murder and the prevailing murder rates, either. Consequently, this general background must be appreciated when discussing the causal and empirical issues here. 

A study published in &quot;The American Journal of Economics and Sociology&quot; in 1997 concluded that the amount of gun-related crime and deaths is affected more by the state of the area in terms of unemployment, alcohol problems and drug problems instead of the laws and regulations. This study analyzed statistics gathered on the amount of gun crime in states with strict and lenient gun policies and determined that the amount of gun crime is related to how impoverished an area is.

A 2003 CDC study determined &quot;The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.&quot; They go on to state &quot;a finding of insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness but rather as an indicator that additional research is needed before an intervention can be evaluated for its effectiveness.&quot;

=====Homicide=====
With 5% of the world&#x27;s population, U.S. residents own roughly 50% of the world&#x27;s civilian-owned firearms. In addition, up to 48% of households within America have guns. According to the UNODC, 60% of U.S. homicides in 2009 were perpetrated using a firearm. U.S. homicide rates vary widely from state to state. In 2014, the lowest homicide rates were in New Hampshire, North Dakota, and Vermont (each 0.0 per 100,000 people), and the highest were in Louisiana (11.7) and Mississippi (11.4).

Gary Kleck, a criminologist at Florida State University, and his colleague Marc Gertz, published a study in 1995 estimating that approximately 2.5 million American adults used their gun in self-defense annually. The incidents that Kleck extrapolated based on his questionnaire results generally did not involve the firing of the gun, and he estimates that as many as 1.9 million of those instances involved a handgun. These studies have been subject to criticism on a number of methodological and logical grounds and Kleck has responded with a rebuttal.

Another study from the same period, the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), estimated 65,000 DGUs (Defensive gun use) annually. The NCVS survey differed from Kleck&#x27;s study in that it only interviewed those who reported a threatened, attempted, or completed victimization for one of six crimes: rape, robbery, assault, burglary, non-business larceny, and motor vehicle theft. The NCVS, however, does not actually directly ask about defensive gun use, so estimates of this set of events are not very meaningful. A National Research Council report said that Kleck&#x27;s estimates appeared to be exaggerated and that it was almost certain that &quot;some of what respondents designate[d] as their own self-defense would be construed as aggression by others&quot;.

In a review of research of the effects of gun rates on crime rates, Kleck determined that of studies addressing homicide rate, half of them found a connection between gun ownership and homicide, but these were usually the least rigorous studies. Only six studies controlled at least six statistically significant confound variables, and none of them showed a significant positive effect. Eleven macro-level studies showed that crime rates increase gun levels (not vice versa). The reason that there is no opposite effect may be that most owners are noncriminals and that they may use guns to prevent violence.

Commenting on the external validity of Kleck&#x27;s report, David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, said: &quot;Given the number of victims allegedly being saved with guns, it would seem natural to conclude that owning a gun substantially reduces your chances of being murdered. Yet a careful case-control study of homicide in the home found that a gun in the home was associated with an increased rather than a reduced risk of homicide. Virtually all of this risk involved homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.&quot; Kleck however pointed out that most of the firearms used in the Kellermann study were not the same ones kept in the household by the victim. Similarly in 2007 when the Permit-To-Purchase law was repealed in Missouri, 2008 saw a 34% increase in the rate of firearm homicides in that year alone, and the figure continues to be higher than the figure pre-2007.
One study found that homicide rates as a whole, especially those as a result of firearms use, are not always significantly lower in many other developed countries. Kleck wrote, &quot;...cross-national comparisons do not provide a sound basis for assessing the impact of gun ownership levels on crime rates.&quot; One study published in the &quot;International Journal of Epidemiology&quot; found that for the year of 1998: &quot;During the one-year study period (1998), 88,649 firearm deaths were reported. Overall firearm mortality rates are five to six times higher in high-income (HI) and upper-middle-income (UMI) countries in the Americas (12.72) than in Europe (2.17) or Oceania (2.57) and 95 times higher than in Asia (0.13). The rate of firearm deaths in the United States (14.24 per 100,000) exceeds that of its economic counterparts (1.76) eightfold and that of UMI countries (9.69) by a factor of 1.5. Suicide and homicide contribute equally to total firearm deaths in the U.S., but most firearm deaths are suicides (71%) in HI countries and homicides (72%) in UMI countries.&quot;

====Suicide====

Firearms accounted for 51.5% of U.S. suicides in 2013, and suicides account for 63% of all firearm-related deaths. A 2012 review by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health found that in the United States, the percent of suicide attempts that prove fatal is &quot;strongly related to the availability of household firearms.&quot; Prior to this, one book written by criminologist Gary Kleck in the 1990s stated that they found no relationship between gun availability and suicide rates.

==== Public health crisis ====
Though the CDC does not prescribe firearm legislation measures, due to limited policy-related research findings, a CDC &quot;Vital Signs&quot; report identifies firearm-related death as &quot;a significant and growing public health problem in the United States.&quot; The same report states that firearm related violence in the U.S. is linked to widening racial and ethnic inequalities.

A 2022 correspondence between researchers at the University of Michigan and the New England Journal of Medicine states that &quot;generational investments are being made in the prevention of firearm violence, including new funding opportunities from the CDC and the National Institutes of Health.&quot; The correspondence refers to &quot;funding for the prevention of community violence (that) has been proposed in federal infrastructure legislation.&quot; The researchers emphasize the significance of such policy measures as a preventative public health solution, in light of data indicating rising child mortality as a result of firearm related incidents, citing statistical evidence of firearm-related deaths replacing motor vehicle accidents as the leading cause of child mortality in 2020.

In 2009, the Public Health Law Research program, an independent organization, published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health, that concern the effectiveness of various laws related to gun safety. Among their findings:
* There is not enough evidence to establish the effectiveness of &quot;shall issue&quot; laws, as distinct from &quot;may issue&quot; laws, as a public health intervention to reduce violent crime.
* There is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of waiting period laws as public health interventions aimed at preventing gun-related violence and suicide.
* Although child access prevention laws may represent a promising intervention for reducing gun-related morbidity and mortality among children, there is currently insufficient evidence to validate their effectiveness as a public health intervention aimed at reducing gun-related harms.
* There is insufficient evidence to establish the effectiveness of such bans as public health interventions aimed at reducing gun-related harms.
* There is insufficient evidence to validate the effectiveness of firearm licensing and registration requirements as legal interventions aimed to reduce firearm related harms.

==Federal and state laws==
The number of federal and state gun laws is unknown. A 2005 &quot;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&quot; study says 300, and the NRA says 20,000, though the &quot;Washington Post&quot; fact checker says of that decades-old figure: &quot;This 20,000 figure appears to be an ancient guesstimate that has hardened over the decades into a constantly repeated, never-questioned talking point. It could be lower, or higher, depending on who&#x27;s counting what.&quot;

===Federal laws===
Federal gun laws are enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Most federal gun laws were enacted through:
* National Firearms Act (1934)
* Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (1968)
* Gun Control Act of 1968 (1968)
* Firearm Owners Protection Act (1986)
* Undetectable Firearms Act (1988)
* Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (1990) (ruled unconstitutional as originally written; upheld after minor edits were made by Congress)
* Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (1993)
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban (1994) (expired 2004)

===State laws and constitutions===
In addition to federal gun laws, all U.S. states and some local jurisdictions have imposed their own firearms restrictions. Each of the fifty states has its own laws regarding guns.

Provisions in State constitutions vary. For example, Hawaii&#x27;s constitution simply copies the text of the Second Amendment verbatim, while North Carolina and South Carolina begin with the same but continue with an injunction against maintaining standing armies. Alaska also begins with the full text of the Second Amendment, but adds that the right &quot;shall not be denied or infringed by the State or a political subdivision of the State&quot;. Rhode Island subtracts the first half of the Second Amendment, leaving only, &quot;[t]he right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed&quot;.

The majority of the remaining states&#x27; constitutions differ from the text of the U.S. Constitution primarily in their clarification of exactly to whom the right belongs or by the inclusion of additional, specific protections or restrictions. Seventeen states refer to the right to keep and bear arms as being an individual right, with Utah and Alaska referring to it explicitly as &quot;[t]he individual right to keep and bear arms&quot;, while the other fifteen refer to the right as belonging to &quot;every citizen&quot;, &quot;all individuals&quot;, &quot;all persons&quot;, or another, very similar phrase. In contrast are four states which make no mention whatever of an individual right or of defense of one&#x27;s self as a valid basis for the right to arms. Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Tennessee all state that the right is &quot;for the common defense&quot;, while Virginia&#x27;s constitution explicitly indicates that the right is derived from the need for a militia to defend the state.

Most state constitutions enumerate one or more reasons for the keeping of arms. Twenty-four states include self-defense as a valid, protected use of arms; twenty-eight cite defense of the state as a proper purpose. Ten states extend the right to defense of home and/or property, five include the defense of family, and six add hunting and recreation. Idaho is uniquely specific in its provision that &quot;[n]o law shall impose licensure, registration, or special taxation on the ownership or possession of firearms or ammunition. Nor shall any law permit the confiscation of firearms, except those actually used in the commission of a felony&quot;. Fifteen state constitutions include specific restrictions on the right to keep and bear arms. Florida&#x27;s constitution calls for a three-day waiting period for all modern cartridge handgun purchases, with exceptions for handgun purchases by those holding a CCW license, or for anyone who purchases a black-powder handgun. Illinois prefaces the right by indicating that it is &quot;[s]ubject ... to the police power&quot;. Florida and the remaining thirteen states with specific restrictions all carry a provision to the effect that the state legislature may enact laws regulating the carrying, concealing, and/or wearing of arms. Forty states some or all local gun laws, due in part to campaigning by the NRA for such legislation.

<text>The Zeta Project is an American science fiction animated television series produced by Warner Bros. Animation, which first aired on Kids&#x27; WB in January 2001. It is the sixth series of the DC Animated Universe, and a spin-off series based on the character Zeta from the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; episode of the same name. The show was created by Robert Goodman.

The story&#x27;s main character, Infiltration Unit Zeta, is a humanoid robot (synthoid) designed to carry out covert assassinations on behalf of the National Security Agency. When Zeta discovers that one of his targets is innocent, he experiences an existential crisis about goodness and the value of life; following this epiphany, Zeta finds he can no longer kill. He refuses to continue working as an infiltration unit and abandons his mission, going rogue. As he tries to find his creator, Dr. Selig, Zeta is pursued by a team of NSA agents led by Agent Bennet and aided by a 15-year-old runaway, Rosalie &quot;Ro&quot; Rowan.

The series was cancelled after two seasons.

==Overview==
&quot;The Zeta Project&quot; is inspired by &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, and follows Zeta and Ro as they attempt to prove he is non-violent, while the NSA agents pursuing him believe the terrorists he was investigating before going rogue have reprogrammed him for an unknown purpose. To prove his innocence, Zeta and Ro search for his creator, the elusive Dr. Selig.

A spin-off of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, Goodman initially pitched the show with plans to be darker than the original show. However, when the pitch went to Kids&#x27; WB, the network wanted shows that would skew to a younger demographic, and &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; was ultimately picked up with the thought process &quot;It&#x27;s a robot, and it&#x27;s a teenage girl. How much fun can that be?&quot;. The show staff promised that most of the locations Zeta would encounter would not be as dark, gothic, and oppressive as &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;&#x27;s Gotham City. As a result of this and other constraints, Goodman&#x27;s original vision for the show&#x27;s messages on dark government, misuse of technology, and various social and political issues became more difficult to execute.

Despite the lighter tone adopted by the final product, Kids&#x27; WB felt &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; was too dark throughout its run and almost canceled it entirely following the September 11th attacks due to its plotlines involving terrorism and commentary on the NSA. Ultimately, the show continued for one more season before Goodman left, believing that network demands were pushing the show away from his vision.

==Characters==
===Infiltration Unit Zeta===
Zeta is a synthoid who was originally designed to gather information and kill select targets for the NSA. However, after realizing that one of his targets was actually innocent, he refused to kill anymore and went on the run. Ever since, Zeta&#x27;s creators have been pursuing him, convinced that he was reprogrammed by terrorists. Zeta hopes that his creator, Dr. Selig, can prove his innocence, and so is searching for him. He meets Rosalie after saving her from a street gang, and in return she helps him escape from the agents pursuing him. Though Zeta no longer possesses most weapons he was originally equipped with, his arms are equipped with saw blades and cutting lasers; he also possesses various non-lethal tools, such as welding lasers, a computer interface, and an unlimited credit card. He has a high-endurance metal frame and the ability to project a hologram around himself and alter his voice. Additionally, he is faster than a human, can perceive wavelengths outside human perception, and is self-repairing to a limited degree.

===Rosalie &quot;Ro&quot; Rowan===
Rosalie Rowan is a 15-year-old girl who grew up in foster care in Hillsburg with Sheriff Morgan and his family before being assigned to a state-run home on Gaines Street. The only thing she knows about her family is vague memories of an older brother, who she was separated from years ago by the foster care system. She ran away from the state system at fifteen years old and joined a gang to have a home. But when she refused to take part in robbing a bank to prove herself to the leader, she left the gang. As she and Zeta search for his creator, Ro embarks on her own journey as she searches for a &quot;family&quot; to belong to. She serves as Zeta&#x27;s guide to &quot;passing&quot; among humans, and teaches him lessons about being human. Additionally, she is a source of comedy in the series, contrasting with Zeta&#x27;s stoic nature. She is visually inspired by Priss from &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

===Special Agent James Bennet===
Agent Bennet is the leader of the NSA team sent to capture Zeta and bring him back alive, believing him to be working with the terrorist organization Brother&#x27;s Day. Despite his supposed professionalism, he is shown disobeying orders when it suits him and abusing his authority. Despite overhearing a conversation between Dr. Selig and Zeta, in which Selig admits he implanted a chip inside Zeta that gave him a conscience, it is unknown if he is willing to cease being his enemy. Bennet is inspired by Lt. Philip Gerard from &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

===Dr. Eli Selig===
Eli Selig is Zeta&#x27;s creator, who knows his abilities and limitations better than anyone else. Since building Zeta, he has moved on to a secretive government project and become reclusive, only appearing where and when his work demands.

===Agent Orin West and Marcia Lee===
Formerly Scout Unit Four, partner NSA Agent Orin West and Marcia Lee fail to capture Zeta at the Wood Valley Maryland hoverbus station and are assigned to work for Agent Bennet as punishment, dedicating themselves to capturing Zeta.

West is clumsy and overeager, while Lee is more controlled and by-the-book and keeps him in check. Lee has her doubts about Zeta&#x27;s guilt and is willing to believe he might be peaceful, which sometimes putting her at odds with Bennet. Lee eventually leaves Bennet&#x27;s team and is replaced by Agent Rush.

West shares a last name with and resembles Wally West, who is also voiced by Rosenbaum. However, showrunner Bob Goodman has stated this was coincidental.

===Bucky Buenaventura===
Bucky Buenaventura is a 12-year-old boy and child prodigy, who was emancipated by his parents and lives in the Sorben Institute, an academic think tank. He is skilled at hacking and loves hacking into high-security corporate computers and exposing government secrets to show that he is capable of it. Bucky travels around freely and shows interest in Zeta and Ro as he keeps an eye on them.

===Infiltration Unit 7===
IU7 is the next generation of Infiltration Unit after Zeta, which Agent Bennet unleashes to capture its predecessor. Like him, it is a synthoid with mimicry skills and wields a large arsenal of weapons, but its metal frame is larger, powerful, and heavily armed. Because of the single-mindedness of IU7&#x27;s programming, Zeta and Ro usually find ways to outsmart it.

==Cancellation and future==
Following the September 11th attacks, Kids&#x27; WB considered canceling &quot;The Zeta Project&quot;, but Bob Goodman convinced them he could keep the show running without even mentioning terrorists. However, Kids&#x27; WB demanded that if the show were to be picked up for a third season, this season needed to end on a cliffhanger that appeared to kill Zee&#x27;s creator, Dr. Selig. Eventually, Kids&#x27; WB! told Goodman that the finale would be the end of Zeta&#x27;s search for Selig, and that a third season would reveal that Ro was also a robot, and follow the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, adventure of the week, formula. Tired of network demands getting in the way of his vision, Goodman ultimately quit the show. Interviews were held to replace him as show runner, but enthusiasm for the show lowered following his exit.

In December 2004, John Schneider revealed he was working on a filmed version of the show with series creator Bob Goodman. Goodman later expanded, saying Warner Bros. Television Studios was interested in adapting the show in an hour long format. As producers, Schneider and Goodman developed a live-action series that took liberties with the Zeta concept to fit the sensibilities of the network at the time, which included lessening similarities to &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, since the recent reboot underperformed expectations. The show would have featured Ro working in the FBI&#x27;s cyber crimes unit, with Zee having replaced her partner in the pilot. The show would have had them solving cases week to week while hunting down Zeta&#x27;s creator and Ro&#x27;s family.

Over the years, Bob Goodman has stated a desire to finish the series&#x27; story, in either comic form or long-form straight-to-DVD format. Over the years, he has hinted at many plot points for unproduced seasons, including:
* The hand seen in the cliffhanger being revealed to belong to Andrea Donoso, Selig&#x27;s synthoid assistant and bodyguard,
* Selig having a new plan with important work for Zeta,
* Ro&#x27;s search for her family, focusing on her mother,
* Plans for an Infiltration Unit 8,
* An episode referencing the fan theory that Agent West was a descendant of Wally West by temporarily giving him super-speed.

==Legacy==
===Influence===
Despite the show&#x27;s relative obscurity, &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; has made its way into many other DC projects. Early synthoids resembling Zeta&#x27;s original design, dubbed Z-8s, appear in &quot;Justice League&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;. In 2013, Zeta appeared in &quot;Batman Beyond Unlimited&quot; #16 as part of the new Terrific Trio, alongside Plastic Man and &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; villain Earth Mover. The seventh and eighth seasons of &quot;Arrow&quot; featured a 2040s set future where a company named Galaxy One unleashed robot soldiers named Zeta. The AI in 2022&#x27;s &quot;Batman Unburied&quot; podcast was named Zeta, after &quot;The Zeta Project&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Music==
As with other DCAU shows before it, &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; was scored by Lolita Ritmanis, Michael McCuistion, Kristopher Carter, and supervising composer Shirley Walker. Working concurrently with the final season of &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, for Zeta&#x27;s first season, the Walker team worked to compose original music for each episode that blended the sound of a live orchestra composed of musicians hired from American Federation of Musicians Local 47, with more contemporary electronic elements the team recorded in their own studio.

According to McCuistion, &quot;Each episode was a different take, musically, and there were some threads of course, but I remember several of them having different musical environments, and that was really interesting creatively. [...] it certainly didn&#x27;t share any of the flavor of Batman Beyond in terms of music, I don&#x27;t think. It was very futuristic and very fun, but yeah, it didn&#x27;t have that sort of gritty, underworld cultural thing going on.&quot;

The Zeta Project was the final show the Dynamic Music Partners (Ritmanis, McCuistion, Carter) had a live orchestra on, and played a hand in the Dynamic Music Partner&#x27;s being hired to score Treyarch&#x27;s Spider-Man

==Home video==
First announced at Warner Home Video&#x27;s annual Home Theater Forum chat in September 2008, WHV (via DC Comics and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released the first season of &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; as a 2-DVD set for Region 1 on March 17, 2009. The bonus material for the set was handled by Retrofit Films, who reached out to fans of the series to help field interview questions for the cast and crew. While the released disc featured a 16-minute documentary featurette, titled &quot;The Making of Zeta&quot;, about the show&#x27;s origin with commentary from the voice cast and production staff, the original press release stated the set would include a since unreleased 15–20 minute featurette titled &quot;Finding Freedom&quot;, a roundtable discussion, in which the cast speculates on various theories of where the show would have gone while producer/show runner Robert Goodman and his team give the fans the definitive answers.

The second season was initially reported to be on the way as early as December 2008. The following month, series creator Bob Goodman teased that bonus features for the season 2 set were filmed at the same time of the season 1 features, and later expanded that the season was slated to release in mid-2009 with a panel discussion featurette with Julie Nathanson, Liz Holzman, Joe Kuhr and himself that covered behind-the-scenes anecdotes. However, sales for season one did not meet Warner Home Video&#x27;s expectations, resulting in the cancellation of the Season 2 release.

Alongside a re-printing of Season 1, Season 2 was finally announced for release by Warner Archive in February 2017 and arrived March 14, 2017. Attempts to locate the originally planned bonus features were unsuccessful, and they remain lost. To promote the release, Warner Archive held the &quot;Warner Archive Collection&#x27;s Kids&#x27; WB Flashback&quot; panel at WonderCon Anaheim, featuring Diedrich Bader, Julie Nathanson, and Bob Goodman, as well as Phil LaMarr, who was representing WAC&#x27;s recent Static Shock DVD releases.

==Video game==
Zeta Quest 3D was launched May 24, 2001. Advertised as a unique multi-environment, multi-level &quot;walk-through&quot; online video game, &quot;Zeta Quest 3D&quot;, let players assume the identity of Zeta, staying one step ahead of the NSA, while trying to clear his name. The game was built for the short lived CyberWorld QBORGs Browser System. According to Bob Goodman, he and Joe Kuhr contributed to vetting the writing process of the game. Not much is known about the plot, but many of the games original files are archived online and include a room named &quot;IU8 Lab&quot;, suggesting the existence of an Infiltration Unit 8, as well as sprites of doctors seen in the episode &quot;Absolute Zero&quot;.

<text>Fiona Elizabeth Ann Jones (née Hamilton; 27 February 1957 – 28 January 2007) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom. She was elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Newark in Labour&#x27;s landslide victory in the 1997 general election.

Jones was accused of fraudulently failing to declare the full amount of her election costs, convicted of election fraud in March 1999, and had the Labour whip withdrawn. She was the first MP to be disqualified from membership of the House of Commons for that offence since it was introduced by the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883. However, the Court of Appeal overturned her conviction within weeks: the disqualification was revoked, and she resumed her place in the House of Commons. However, she lost her seat in the 2001 general election. She later lost a civil case brought against the police for malicious prosecution.

Jones was born in Liverpool and grew up in Fazakerley. An only child, her father, Fred Hamilton, was a production manager for a pharmaceutical company, and was a friend of Labour MP Eric Heffer. Heffer gave her a copy of &quot;The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists&quot; when she was young, which inspired her to become an active socialist. She attended Wirral College of Art and Preston College, and joined the Labour Party at the age of 17.

She became a freelance journalist; her future husband, Christopher Jones, was also a journalist, who worked for the BBC. The couple moved to Lincolnshire. They were married in north Wales in 1982. They had two sons; Penri and Huw.

==Political career==
Jones was elected as a Labour member of West Lindsey District Council, gaining Gainsborough South West ward from the Liberal Democrats in 1990. She served a single term and did not seek re-election in 1994. She was unsuccessful as the Labour Parliamentary candidate in the Conservative stronghold of Gainsborough and Horncastle in the 1992 general election, finishing in third place, and then failed to secure the nomination to fight for the marginal seat of Lincoln and the safe Labour seat of Liverpool Riverside.

In September 1995, she was selected to fight at Newark. Although she presented herself at the selection meetings as a traditional socialist, she was nevertheless a New Labour professional. After her selection, she presented her New Labour sympathies, much to the consternation of a number of local party activists who had supported her nomination.

She was elected as Member of Parliament for Newark in the 1997 general election, ousting Conservative MP Richard Alexander, who had held the seat since the 1979 general election. She was pictured alongside 96 other women Labour MPs in the &quot;Blair babes&quot; photograph, and seen next to Tony Blair himself.

However, the press labelled her the &quot;parliamentary virgin&quot;, as she was the last of the 242 new MPs to make their maiden speech in the Commons. &quot;Having endured through gritted teeth being dubbed a &#x27;Blair&#x27;s babe&#x27;, I am grateful at least to have the opportunity to relinquish for ever the title of being the last virgin in the House,&quot; she announced upon making the speech in January 1998. A Roman Catholic, Jones campaigned against abortion, and she appeared with Lord Longford at a Labour conference fringe meeting.

After complaints by the Liberal Democrats, the police launched an investigation into her spending at the 1997 election campaign. Although submitting election expenses within the permitted maximum, she was charged with her agent Des Whicher with having fraudulently omitted to declare spending which would have taken her well over it. Although most of the charges collapsed and were withdrawn by the trial Judge, a dispute over whether the rent for a campaign office used also as party headquarters was left to the Jury. The two were convicted on 19 March 1999 of &quot;corrupt practices&quot;, under section 82(6) of the Representation of the People Act 1983 and she was sentenced to 100 hours&#x27; community service. Prominent members of the local Labour Party gave evidence against her, and much was made at the time of her rivals for the Labour Party candidacy. At the selection meeting of the Newark Branch Labour Party, the local candidate came in a poor fourth, and withdrew from the contest at that stage. The runner-up, Nick Palmer went on to win the Labour Party candidacy for the Broxtowe constituency. As a result of the conviction, Jones was disqualified from the House of Commons.

However, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions on 15 April 1999.

A divisional court of the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division held that the effect of the quashing of the conviction was that the disqualification was revoked with no need for a by-election, and she resumed her seat on 29 April.

She contested her seat in the 2001 general election, but lost to the Conservative candidate Patrick Mercer. In the 12 months before the 2001 general election, the local newspaper, The &quot;Newark Advertiser&quot; restricted reporting of her routine activities after she unsuccessfully demanded that every report concerning her should be submitted for her approval before publication; the newspaper lifted the restriction during the campaign.

==Later life==
After studying law at the University of Lincoln, Jones brought a civil case against Nottinghamshire Police for malicious prosecution. The case was dismissed in December 2005, leaving her to bear costs of £45,000. In an interview, she claimed that a government minister had asked her for sex in return for assisting her to secure promotion.

==Death==
Jones reportedly became reliant on alcohol after she was shunned by her colleagues when she returned to the House of Commons in 1999 - only 34 signed an early day motion welcoming her back to the House of Commons after her conviction was quashed. Her husband said that she refused to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in case she was recognised.

She was found dead at her home in Saxilby by her husband, reportedly surrounded by 15 empty vodka bottles. Her cause of death was reported as alcoholism or alcoholic liver disease.

<doc id="450964" wikidata="Q1738633" url="?curid=450964" title="Ken Maginnis">
<text>Kenneth Wiggins Maginnis, Baron Maginnis of Drumglass (born 21 January 1938), is a Northern Irish politician and life peer. Since December 2020, he has been suspended from the House of Lords, where he formerly sat for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). He was the Ulster Unionist Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Fermanagh and South Tyrone from 1983 to 2001.

==Background==
Maginnis was educated at the Royal School Dungannon and at Stranmillis College. He worked as a teacher for a number of years before joining the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) in 1971. After leaving the British Army with the rank of major in 1981, he became the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) spokesman on internal security and defence, and was that same year elected to Dungannon District Council, on which he sat for twelve years until losing his seat in 1993.

==August 1981 by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone==
Maginnis was the Ulster Unionist candidate for Fermanagh and South Tyrone in the second by-election in 1981, coming second. This by-election was caused by the death of sitting MP Bobby Sands on hunger strike. As a result of changes to the electoral law with the passing of the Representation of the People Act 1981, another hunger striker could not be nominated. Instead Owen Carron, who had served as Sands&#x27; election agent in the earlier election, was nominated and elected as a &quot;Anti-H-Block Proxy Political Prisoner&quot;.

==Member of Parliament==
The following year, he was elected to the failed Northern Ireland Assembly, as a representative for the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency. At the 1983 general election he was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for the constituency of the same name, defeating Carron who was defending the seat as a Sinn Fein candidate. Two years later, along with the rest of his Unionist colleagues, he resigned his seat in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement, but was re-elected in the subsequent by-election. He continued his protest by refusing to pay his car tax, for which he was sentenced to seven days&#x27; imprisonment in 1987.

==Councillor==
He renewed his membership of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council in 2001 when he was elected for Dungannon Town. However, in 2005 he chose to move to the neighbouring Clogher Valley electoral area in an attempt to boost the UUP vote. This strategy backfired and he again lost his seat.

==House of Lords==
He stood down as an MP at the 2001 general election, and on 20 July of that year was created a life peer taking the title Baron Maginnis of Drumglass, of Carnteel in the County of Tyrone, and took his seat in the House of Lords, sitting initially with the UUP.

In December 2020, the House of Lords Conduct Committee recommended that Maginnis be suspended from the House of Lords for at least 18 months for breaching the Code of Conduct in relation to behaviour that constituted bullying and harassment against four complainants, including homophobic remarks directed at SNP MP Hannah Bardell and Shadow Environment Secretary Luke Pollard. As well as being overheard saying &quot;I am not going to be bullied by queers&quot;, he sent an email to James Gray, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for the Armed Forces, with the subject &quot;Discrimination by Homos&quot;.

==Political views==
Maginnis was perceived to be on the more social liberal wing of the UUP along with Lady Hermon. He is one of only three MPs in the Ulster Unionist Party&#x27;s history not to have been a member of the Orange Order (the other two being Enoch Powell and Lady Hermon), although he was a member of the Apprentice Boys of Derry.

In April 1994 Sinn Féin demanded that their members be permitted to carry personal protection weapons like other political parties following the murder of Catholic woman Theresa Clinton (the wife of a Sinn Féin member) by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Maginnis, speaking as UUP security spokesman, responded: &quot;Those who deliberately and consciously incite violence against themselves should not expect the law-abiding community to finance their protection.

In June 2012, on BBC Northern Ireland&#x27;s &quot;The Nolan Show&quot;, Maginnis stated he was opposed to gay marriage because it was &quot;unnatural&quot; and he did not believe society should &quot;have imposed on it something that is unnatural&quot;. He said: &quot;Does that mean that every deviant practice has to be accommodated? Will the next thing be that we legislate for some sort of bestiality?&quot; The comments prompted the Ulster Unionist Party leader, Mike Nesbitt, to state that Maginnis expressed his views in a personal capacity and did not reflect party policy. Maginnis&#x27;s remarks were condemned by gay rights groups. That same month, at the behest of Nesbitt, he suffered the withdrawal of the UUP party whip over his comments; Maginnis resigned from the UUP on 28 August 2012.

==Controversies==
In August 2013, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass was found guilty of an &quot;angry and abusive tirade&quot; following a road rage incident, and was fined.

In 2016, Maginnis received a heavy fine after refusing to pay a small fine for having the wrong ticket for a train journey between Gatwick Airport and London.

<doc id="450965" wikidata="Q1658898" url="?curid=450965" title="Illuminati (game)">
<text>Illuminati is a card game made by Steve Jackson Games (SJG), inspired by the 1975 book &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea. The game has ominous secret societies competing with each other to control the world through various means, including legal, illegal, and even mystical. It was designed as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek rather than serious&quot; take on conspiracy theories. It contains groups named similarly to real-world organizations, such as the Society for Creative Anachronism and the Symbionese Liberation Army. It can be played by two to eight players. Depending on the number of players, a game can take between one and six hours.

==Genesis of game==
In September 1981, Steve Jackson and his regular freelance cover artist Dave Martin discussed their shared admiration of the &quot;Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;, and the latter suggested a game. Steve Jackson decided against adapting the novel because of the expense of game rights, and the difficulty of adapting a novel with such convoluted plots. He decided &quot;a game about the &quot;secret-conspiracy idea&quot; behind &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;&quot; was viable. After researching the Illuminati and conspiracy theories, and &quot;extensive and enthusiastic playtesting&quot; it went on the market in July 1982 in the (at the time) usual SJG Pocket Box format. Over the next few years, three expansions for the Pocket Box Illuminati game were published. The first two were substantially incorporated into the deluxe edition, while the third was a version of what would become &quot;Illuminati: Brainwash&quot;.

Robert Shea provided a four-paragraph introduction to the rulebook for the &quot;Illuminati Expansion Set 1&quot; (1983), in which he wrote, &quot;Maybe the Illuminati are behind &quot;this game.&quot; They must be—they are, by definition, behind &quot;everything.&quot;&quot;

In 2001, although &quot;Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; co-author Robert Anton Wilson did not specifically name &quot;Illuminati&quot;, he criticized some products for exploiting the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; name without paying royalties by taking advantage of legal loopholes. Later commentators have attributed both the game and the &quot;Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; as using real conspiracies as &quot;targets of ridicule.&quot;

==Description==

The game is played with a deck of special cards, money chips (representing &quot;millions of dollars in low-denomination unmarked banknotes&quot;) and two six-sided dice. There are three types of cards:

* Illuminati
* Groups
* Special cards

The players take role of Illuminati societies that struggle to take over the world. The Pocket Box edition depicted six Illuminati groups: The Bavarian Illuminati, The Discordian Society, The UFOs, The Servants of Cthulhu, The Bermuda Triangle, and The Gnomes of Zürich. The deluxe edition added the Society of Assassins and The Network, and the Illuminati Y2K expansion added the Church of The SubGenius and Shangri-La. The aim of the game is fulfilled when Illuminati build a power structure consisting of given number of cards (dependent on number of players), or when Illuminati fulfill its &quot;special goal&quot;, (such as controlling at least one card of each alignment for the Bermuda Triangle).

The world is represented by group cards such as Secret Masters of Fandom, the CIA, The International Communist Conspiracy, Evil Geniuses for a Better Tomorrow, California, and many more – there are over 300 official cards available. Every group and Illuminati has some Power, Resistance and Income values; most of the world groups have an Alignment. The game is written with the usual SJG humor. The game uses a multitude of conspiracy theory in-jokes, with cards such as the Boy Sprouts (where sinister youth leaders influence the world leaders of tomorrow), the Orbital Mind Control Lasers, the Mafia, two headed Anti-Nuclear Activists, or Trekkies. Special cards represent unexpected phenomena and features, for example increasing Income or Resistance of a group. A &quot;Second Edition&quot; was released in 2018 featuring some updated groups that reference more recent popular culture and events.

The game is played in turns. The primary Illuminati (player) activity is taking control of groups. Other types of attacks are attacks to neutralize (removing from Illuminati power structure and returning to the table - to the world) and attack to destroy (removing from the game). Besides attacking groups the players can trade, form alliances, and many other activities. Tactics such as playing opponents off each other, backstabbing and concealing your true motives are encouraged in this game. In one variant of the game, players are allowed to cheat, steal money from the table and do anything it takes to win.

During an attack to take control, the attacker must overcome the Resistance of attacked groups with combined Power of his groups (affected by Alignment of attacker and attacked), money spent, and influence of special cards. The attacked group can be defended by spending money and special cards by other players (especially by a controlling Illuminati). After a successful attack to take control, the card is placed (along the special markers) next to Illuminati, or another already controlled group forming a &quot;power structure&quot;.

Each group has its own money, marked by money counters on that group. Most groups have an income collected at the beginning of each turn; money can also be moved one step at a time between groups once per turn. Money in the Illuminated group is accessible for defense of or attacks on all groups in the entire world. Money in the groups can only be used by that group, but gives double defense bonus when spent in defense.

Although the game can support two to ten players, a group of four or five is considered ideal. Some Illuminati might seem unbalanced, such as the high-income Gnomes and the low-level Discordians, but sometimes their true value is not visible at first or valuable only in certain circumstances. Planning the power structure is important, since groups close to the Illuminated core have a defense bonus. Also, groups can &quot;block&quot; each other&#x27;s control arrows, through which groups control other groups. The flow of money is important, as a large lump of it will boost the offense / defense of the owning group.

The game has attained cult status in some circles, been referenced in some geek media (like &quot;User Friendly&quot; comic strip). It is also mentioned in Dan Brown&#x27;s novel Angels &amp; Demons, which concerns an apparent attack by the revived Illuminati; the game is referred to as an online computer game, but references to Steve Jackson make clear that the reference is to this game.

==Related games==
Steve Jackson Games released a collectible card game version called &quot;&quot; (1994)&quot;&quot; and a stand-alone version called &quot;Illuminati: Crime Lords&quot; (2004), where the players control mobs in attempt to take over a city. SJG developed some &quot;Illuminated&quot; role-playing game modules for its GURPS system, including &quot;GURPS Illuminati&quot; (1992), &quot;GURPS Illuminati University&quot; (1995), and &quot;GURPS Warehouse 23&quot;.

SJG also released &quot;Hacker&quot; (1992) which is similar to the original &quot;Illuminati&quot; (modulo terminology), but the players fight for the control of computer networks. It is more loose, and based primarily on interlocking access to different computer systems in the web. Players are not set directly towards each other, and several players can share access to a system.

Adventure Systems created a Play-by-mail game (PBM) &quot;Illuminati&quot; game, based on and licensed from the Steve Jackson game, with many modifications. The game was eventually purchased, and is now run, by Flying Buffalo. The designer, Draper Kauffman, had been trying to develop a &quot;global strategy game&quot; for many years when he received a copy of Illuminati. Recalling the creation of the PBM version, Kauffman wrote, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t long before I found that every problem in my own game design had a suspiciously similar solution: &#x27;Hey, how about if we just handle that like they did in &quot;Illuminati?&quot;&quot;

==Reception==
Phil Masters reviewed &quot;Illuminati&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #40, giving it an overall rating of 7 out of 10, and stated that &quot;Overall, this is a playable game with a good element of skill; it creates an appropriate atmosphere of conspiracy and cynicism, although the open hands system rather removes the element of paranoid secrecy inherent in conspiracy theories. &quot;Illuminati&quot; will earn its devotees, especially in America, although it lacks the elegance of the best cult games.&quot;

Phil Masters reviewed &quot;Illuminati&quot; Expansion Sets 1 &amp; 2 for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #44, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that &quot;the concept is certain to appeal to anyone with a pet dislike or a shred of cheap cynicism.&quot;

In the December 1983 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot;, Michael Lowrey believed that Steve Jackson Games had &quot;a definite potential classic here, and one which, properly marketed, could appeal to folks who will never play a wargame in their lives&quot;. However Lowrey thought the two expansion sets were overly expensive, and advised consumers to see how they liked the basic game before buying the expansion sets. 

In &quot;Space Gamer&quot; No. 68, Dave Nalle concurred about the first two expansion sets: &quot;These are excellent but high-priced expansions to a good and popular game. Before buying them and shelling out [the cash], you will probably want to pause to consider how much you will be using them, and as long as you play fairly frequently, the price may be worth the use you&#x27;ll get.&quot;

Several issues later, in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 76, Kevin Ross gave the &quot;Illuminati Expansion Set 3&quot; a positive review, saying, &quot;If you want some great new wrinkles for your &quot;Illuminati&quot; game, you definitely need this supplement. The rules make for a longer but much more enjoyable game. And don&#x27;t let the lack of a Pocket Box or the thinness of the package fool you. There&#x27;s a lot here for [the price].&quot; 

In the December 1993 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 200), Allen Varney called it &quot;a brilliant card-and-token game.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Ingenious and satirical,
the &quot;Illuminati&quot; game fosters good-humored paranoia and dramatic struggles.&quot;

In 2007, almost 25 years after its original publication, &quot;Illuminati&quot; was chosen for the book &quot;Hobby Games: The 100 Best&quot;. Scott Haring wrote that &quot;Illuminati&quot; is &quot;too much fun and has too much replay value to fade away on its own. Indeed, 25 years after its initial release, &quot;Illuminati&quot; is still immensely popular, having spawned multiple editions, three expansion sets, Steve Jackson Games&#x27; corporate logo, a spinoff collectible card game that is still the single biggest-selling product line in SJ Games history, and — my favorite — a complete set of color-coded pins that identified Illuminati members and their specialty.&quot;
