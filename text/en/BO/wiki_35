<text>An electroshock weapon is an incapacitating weapon. It delivers an electric shock aimed at temporarily disrupting muscle functions and/or inflicting pain, usually without causing significant injury.

Many types of these devices exist. Stun guns, batons (or prods), cattle prods, shock collars, and belts administer an electric shock by direct contact, whereas Tasers fire projectiles that administer the shock through thin flexible wires. Long-range electroshock projectiles, which can be fired from ordinary shotguns and do not need the wires, have also been developed.

Though the two terms are often used interchangeably, stun guns are actually direct contact weapons that work mainly through pain compliance by affecting the sensory nervous system. It can also cause some muscular disruption, but that generally requires 3–5 seconds of direct contact. In comparison, a Taser is a long range weapon that fires barbed darts and incapacitates the target by disrupting voluntary muscular control through the motor nervous system. However, some models of Taser blur this distinction as they are capable of delivering a &quot;drive stun&quot;, a pain compliance technique involving placing the weapon in direct contact with the subject&#x27;s body and discharging a shock without firing the probes. 

== History ==

In 1935, Ciril Diaz of Cuba designed an electroshock glove for use by the police. The glove delivered 1,500 volts of electricity (only 3% of the modern tasers voltage)

Jack Cover, a NASA researcher, began developing the Taser in 1969. By 1974, he had completed the device, which he named after his childhood hero Tom Swift (&quot;Thomas A. Swift&#x27;s electric rifle&quot;). The Taser Public Defender product used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.
Cover&#x27;s patent was adapted by Nova Technologies in 1983 for the Nova XR-5000, their first non-projectile hand-held style stun gun. The XR-5000 design was widely copied as the source for the compact handheld stun gun used today.

==Principle of operation==
Electroshock weapon technology uses a temporary high-voltage, low-current electrical discharge to override the body&#x27;s muscle-triggering mechanisms. Commonly referred to as a stun gun, electroshock weapons are a relative of cattle prods, which have been around for over 100 years and are the precursor of stun guns. The recipient is immobilized via two metal probes connected via wires to the electroshock device. The recipient feels pain, and can be momentarily paralyzed while an electric current is being applied. Essential to the operation of electroshock, stun guns and cattle prods is sufficient current to allow the weapon to stun. Without current these weapons cannot stun and the degree to which the weapon is capable of stunning depends on its proper use of current. It is reported that applying electroshock devices to more sensitive parts of the body is even more painful. The maximum effective areas for stun gun usage are upper shoulder, below the rib cage, and the upper hip. High voltages are used, but because most devices use a less-lethal current, death does not usually occur from a single shock. The resulting &quot;shock&quot; is caused by muscles twitching uncontrollably, appearing as muscle spasms.

The internal circuits of most electroshock weapons are fairly simple, based on either an oscillator, resonant circuit (a power inverter), and step-up transformer or a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier to achieve an alternating high-voltage discharge or a continuous direct-current discharge. It may be powered by one or more batteries depending on manufacturer and model. The amount of current generated depends on what stunning capabilities are desired, but without proper current calculations, the cause and effect of high voltage is muted. Output voltage is claimed to be in the range of 100 V up to 6 kV; current intensity output is claimed to be in the range of 100 to 500 mA; individual impulse duration is claimed to be in the range of 10 to 100 μs (microseconds); frequency of impulse is claimed to be in the range of 2 to 40 Hz; electrical charge delivered is claimed to be in the range of 15 to 500 μC (microcoulombs); energy delivered is claimed to be in the range of 0.9 to 10 J.
 The output &quot;current&quot; upon contact with the target will depend on various factors such as target&#x27;s resistance, skin type, moisture, bodily salinity, clothing, the electroshock weapon&#x27;s internal circuitry, discharge waveform, and battery conditions.

The M-26 Taser models produce a peak current of 18 amperes in pulses that last for around 10 microseconds.

Manufacturers&#x27; instructions and manuals shipped with the products state that a half-second shock duration will cause intense pain and muscle contractions, startling most people greatly. Two to three seconds will often cause the recipient to become dazed and drop to the ground, and over three seconds will usually completely disorient and drop the recipient for at least several seconds. Taser International warns law enforcement agencies that &quot;prolonged or continuous exposure(s) to the TASER device&#x27;s electrical charge&quot; may lead to medical risks such as cumulative exhaustion and breathing impairment.

Because there was no automatic stop on older model Taser devices, many officers have used it repeatedly or for a prolonged period of time, thus potentially contributing to suspects&#x27; injuries or death. The current X26 model automatically stops five seconds after the trigger is depressed and then the trigger must be depressed again to send another shock. The trigger can be held down continuously for a longer shock or the device can be switched off before the full five seconds have elapsed. The devices have no protections against multiple police officers giving multiple shocks, cumulatively exceeding the recommended maximum levels.

===Countermeasures===
There is a fabric that purports to protect the wearer from Taser devices or other electroshock weapons.
==Commercially available varieties==

===Compact stun guns===

The compact handheld stun guns are about the size of a TV remote or calculator, and they must touch the subject when used. The original XR-5000 design in 1983 had the electrodes spread farther apart to make the noisy electric arc between the electrodes as a more visible warning. Some such devices are available disguised as other objects, such as umbrellas, mobile phones or pens.

===Electric shock prods===

The larger baton-style prods are similar in basic design to an electric cattle prod. It has a metal end split into two parts electrically insulated from each other, or two thin projecting metal electrodes about apart, at an end of a shaft containing the batteries and mechanism. At the other end of the shaft are a handle and a switch. Both electrodes must touch the subject. In some types the sides of the baton can be electrified to stop the subject from grasping the baton above the electrodes.

Some models are built into long flashlights also designed to administer an electric shock with its lit end&#x27;s metal surround (which is split into halves insulated from each other).

===Stun belts===

A stun belt is a belt that is fastened around the subject&#x27;s waist, leg, or arm that carries a battery and control pack, and contains features to stop the subject from unfastening or removing it. A remote-control signal is sent to tell the control pack to give the subject an electric shock. Some models are activated by the subject&#x27;s movement.

The United States uses these devices to control prisoners. One type is the REACT belt. Some stun belts can restrain the subject&#x27;s hands and have a strap going under his groin to stop him from rotating the belt around his waist to reach its battery and control pack and trying to deactivate it. Stun belts are not generally available to the public.

===Stun shields===
Stun shields are shields with electrodes embedded into the face, originally marketed for animal control, that have been adopted for riot control.

===Taser===
A taser is a handheld weapon that fires two small dart-like electrodes which remain connected to the main unit by conductors. It delivers electric current to disrupt voluntary control of muscles resulting in pain and broad &quot;neuromuscular incapacitation&quot;.

===Wireless long-range electric shock weapon===

Taser International has developed a long-range wireless electro-shock projectile called XREP(eXtended Range Electro-Muscular Projectile), which can be fired from any 12-gauge shotgun. It contains a small high-voltage battery. Its range is currently , but the U.S. Department of Defense, which funded development for the technology, expected delivery of a range projectile of this type from the company in 2007.

An XREP projectile was controversially used by British police during the 2010 Northumbria Police manhunt. It subsequently transpired that the XREP had never been officially approved for use in the United Kingdom and the weapon system was provided unrequested to the police at the scene directly by the civilian company which distributes Taser International&#x27;s products in the UK. The company&#x27;s license to provide Taser systems was afterwards revoked by the Home Secretary Theresa May.

==Prototype designs==
Due to increased interest in developing less-lethal weapons, mainly from the U.S. Military, a number of new types of electroshock weapon are being researched. They are designed to provide a &quot;ranged&quot; less-lethal weapon.

The electrolaser is a prototype weapon that uses a laser to create a conducting ionized channel through the air.

A shockround is a piezo-electric projectile that generates and releases electric charge on impact.

===Weapons that administer electric shock through a stream of fluid===
Prototype electroshock guns exist that replace the solid wire with a stream of conductive liquid (e.g., metallic solution, salt water), which offers an increase in the range of a Taser CEW (or better) and the possibility of multiple shots. According to the proponents of this technology, difficulties associated with this experimental design include:
*&quot;Non-continuous&quot; discharge onto subject: liquid stream needs over and over 5-second discharge
*&quot;Pooling&quot; of conductive liquid at base of subject, making apprehension of subject difficult by observing officers
*Need to carry a large tank of the liquid used, and a propellant canister, like a &quot;water gun&quot;, to administer consecutive bursts of liquid over distances.

Another design, announced by Rheinmetall W&amp;M as a prototype in 2003, uses an aerosol as the conductive medium. The manufacturers called it a &quot;Plasma Taser&quot;; however, this is only a marketing name, and the weapon does not use plasma. According to the proponents of this technology, problems associated with this design include:
*Poor electrical conductivity
*Range of concept design is minimal (a gas cannot be propelled greater than effectively)
*The &quot;gassing effect&quot;: all subjects in enclosed spaces are subjected to the same effects

===The S5: A repeating cyclical stun pistol===

Since 2001, Russian developer Oleg Nemtyshkin has sought to create a repeating stun pistol, after the Axon Taser CEW. This weapon, the first of its kind, uses tensioned, uninsulated wire and is capable of cycling multiple shots with the pull of a trigger. A video of the S5 pistol firing at targets was uploaded on YouTube.

==Controversies==
Because of the use of electricity and the claim of the weapon being non-lethal, controversy has sprouted over particular incidents involving the weapon and the use of the weapon in general. In essence, controversy has been centered on the justification of the use of the weapon in certain instances, and, in some cases, health issues that are claimed to be due to the use of the weapon.

Tests conducted by the Cleveland Clinic found that Taser CEWs did not interfere with pacemakers and implantable defibrillators. A study conducted by emergency medicine physicians at the University of California, San Diego, US showed no lasting effects of the Taser device on healthy test subjects. However, Taser International no longer claims the devices are &quot;non-lethal&quot;, instead saying they &quot;are more effective and safer than other use-of-force options&quot;.

Currently, Taser devices are programmed to be activated in automatic five second bursts, and the operator can stop the energy charge by engaging the safety switch. The charge can also be prolonged beyond five seconds if the trigger is held down continuously. The operator can also inflict repeated shock cycles with each pull of the trigger as long as both barbs remain attached to the subject. The only technical limit to the number or length of the electrical cycles is the life of the battery, which can be ten minutes or more.

Concerns about the use of conducted electrical weapons have arisen from cases that include the death of the Polish immigrant Robert Dziekanski at the airport in Vancouver, Canada where he died after the RCMP officer, in spite of his training, repeatedly stunned him with a Taser. The report by forensic pathologist Charles Lee, of Vancouver General Hospital, listed the principal cause of death as &quot;sudden death during restraint&quot;, with a contributory factor of &quot;chronic alcoholism&quot;.

A similar incident occurred in Sydney, Australia, to Roberto Laudisio Curti, a 21-year-old tourist from Brazil. He died after repeated exposure to a Taser device even after being physically apprehended (by the weight of several police officers lying on top of him compressing his chest and making it hard to breathe. He was pepper sprayed at the same time). The Coroner was scathing of the &quot;thuggish&quot; behavior of the police. The repeated use of several Taser devices was considered excessive and unnecessary.

A study for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, indicated that the threshold of energy needed to induce deadly ventricular fibrillation decreased dramatically with each successive burst of pulses; however, one pulse may provide enough energy to induce deadly ventricular fibrillation in some cases. The threshold for women may be less.

Although the Taser CEW is a programmable device, the controlling software does not limit the number of the bursts of pulses and the time between bursts while the trigger is held down continuously, or the number of times the shock cycles can be repeated.

===Legal issues===

Electroshock weapons have been made illegal in Germany by supplement 2 WaffG if they do not carry an official seal of approval demonstrating they do not constitute a health risk. As of July, 2011, no such seal has been issued to any device on the market. According to § 40 Abs. 4 WaffG, the German federal police may approve of exceptions. Such a special approval for purchase, ownership and carrying was in effect until 31 December 2010. As of 1 January 2011, only devices carrying the PTB&#x27;s seal of approval are legal. Previous owners may keep their devices, but cannot carry or sell them. Electroshock weapons effective over a distance, like Taser CEWs, have been completely outlawed in Germany since 1 April 2008.

In the United Kingdom the possession and purchase of any weapon of whatever description designed or adapted for the discharge of any noxious liquid, gas or other thing is prohibited. This includes electroshock weapons.

===Torture===
The United Nations Committee against Torture reports that the use of Taser devices can be a form of torture, due to the acute pain they cause, and warns against the possibility of death in some cases.
 The use of stun belts has been condemned by Amnesty International as torture, not only for the physical pain the devices cause, but also for their heightened abuse potential, due to their perceived &quot;harmlessness&quot; in terms of causing initial injuries, like ordinary police batons do. Amnesty International has reported several alleged cases of excessive electroshock gun use that possibly amount to torture. They have also raised extensive concerns about the use of other electro-shock devices by American police and in American prisons, as they can be (and according to Amnesty International, sometimes are) used to inflict cruel pain on individuals.

Taser CEWs may also not leave the telltale markings that a conventional beating might. The American Civil Liberties Union has also raised concerns about their use, as has the British human rights organization Resist Cardiac Arrest.

== Legality ==

=== Argentina ===
In 2010, one court ruled against the use of five imported Taser devices by the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, to comply with a claim from the Human Rights Observatorium, that states that Taser CEWs are considered an instrument of torture by NGOs and the Committee against Torture of the UN.

=== Australia ===
Possession, ownership and use of a stun gun (including Taser CEWs) by civilians is considerably restricted, if not illegal in all States and Territories. The importation into Australia is restricted with permits being required.

Stun gun use in Australian law enforcement is as follows:

*Australian Federal Police and Australian Capital Territory: used only by officers attached to the Specialist Response Group, qualified general duties (patrol) Sergeants within ACT Policing and Aviation portfolios, and qualified members of Specialist Support Teams in regional offices.
*New South Wales: Used by general duties (patrol), supervisors/duty officers and specialist officers attached to the Tactical Operations Unit and Public Order and Riot Squad.
*Northern Territory: Used by both general duties (patrol) and the Territory Response Group.
*Queensland: Used by both general duties (patrol) and Special Emergency Response Team.
*South Australia: Used by all front line Police, STAR Group and Country Members in limited capacity.
*Tasmania: Used only by the Special Operations Group
*Victoria: Used by the Critical Incident Response Team and Special Operations Group. A year long trial at Bendigo and Morwell stations is also underway by general duties police.
*Western Australia: Used by both general duties (patrol) and the Tactical Response Group.

=== Austria ===
Austria allows police to use stun guns, including Taser CEWs. After using a Tasert CEW, police must immediately call for an ambulance. The victim must be medically checked directly at the place of the shooting, and only a medically trained person may remove the darts. From 2006 to 2012, Austrian police used Taser CEWs 133 times—127 against humans and six against dogs. About 1,000 police officers were permitted in 2012 to carry and use a Taser CEW.

=== Brazil ===
Use of the Taser device is legal for the police in Brazil. Its use is widespread mainly in the Guardas Municipais (Municipal Guards), who receive professional training in the use of electro-conductive pistols. Taser devices are also used by military police and specialized forces. There are laws allowing their use by private security companies, but such use is unusual because of the expense of maintaining a Taser CEW compared with a gun.

=== Canada ===
According to previous interpretation of the &quot;Firearms Act&quot;, Taser CEWs were considered &quot;prohibited weapons&quot; and could be used only by members of law-enforcement agencies after they were imported into the country under a special permit. The possession of restricted weapons must be licensed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Canadian Firearms Program unless exempted by law. A 2008 review of the &quot;Firearms Act&quot; found that the act classifies &quot;the TASER Public Defender and any variant or modified version of it&quot; as &quot;prohibited firearms&quot;. However, Canadian police forces typically treat TASER devices as &quot;prohibited weapons&quot;, inconsistent with the restrictions on firearms.

The direct source for this information comes from an independent report produced by Compliance Strategy Group for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The report is called An Independent Review of the Adoption and Use of Conducted Energy Weapons by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In the report that is available through access to information, the authors argued that the CEW was, for several years after its adoption by the RCMP, erroneously characterized as a prohibited &quot;weapon&quot; under the Criminal Code, as opposed to a prohibited &quot;firearm&quot;. This misunderstanding was subsequently incorporated into the RCMP&#x27;s operational policies and procedures as well as those of other police services in Canada.

While the most recent RCMP operational manual, completed in 2007, correctly refers to the CEW as a prohibited firearm, a number of consequences of this error in classification remain to be dealt with, by both the RCMP and other Canadian police services. Consequently, it could be argued the police in Canada may not have had the proper authority under their provincial policing Acts and Regulation to use the CEW in the first place. The point of unauthorized use by the police was also raised by Dirk Ryneveld, British Columbia&#x27;s Police Complaint Commissioner at the Braidwood inquiry on June 25, 2008. Taser device safety and issues have been extensively rehearsed and investigated after the Robert Dziekański Taser CEW incident at Vancouver International Airport.

===China===
Under the Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on the Control of Firearms and Public Security Punishment Law, stun guns and tasers are prohibited for civilian ownership in China without an application for a state licence. A weapons permit is required to purchase and own a stun gun or taser.

=== Czech Republic ===
Electroshock weapons that require direct contact are not regulated by Czech law. They may be purchased, owned and carried for personal protection without any limitations.

Taser CEWs are considered class C-I firearms under Czech law, i.e. freely available over the counter, however the owner must be older than 18, have full legal capacity, place of residence in the Czech Republic, clean criminal record, full mental capacity and must register the taser with police.

=== Finland ===
In Finland possession of a Taser CEW is legal only for police officers. Police have been using Taser CEWs since 2005. Nowadays there is one in almost every patrol car.

=== France ===
Taser devices are used by the French National Police and Gendarmerie. In September 2008, they were made available to local police by a government decree, but in September 2009, the Council of State reversed the decision judging that the specificities of the weapon required a stricter regulation and control.
However, since the murder of a policewoman on duty, the Taser CEW has been in use again by local police forces since 2010.

=== Germany ===
The purchase, possession, and carrying of Taser devices in Germany has been prohibited since April 1, 2008 (gun control law: &quot;Anlage 2, Abschnitt 1, Nr. 1.3.6. WaffG&quot;). However Taser devices are in use by police SWAT teams, &quot;Spezialeinsatzkommando&quot; (SEK) and others, in 13 out of 16 German states.

=== Greece ===
Greek police use Taser CEWs. Greek Police special forces used a Taser CEW to end the hijacking of a Turkish Airlines A310 by a Turkish citizen at Athens International Airport in March 2003.

=== Hong Kong ===
Under Hong Kong laws, Chapter 238 &quot;Firearms and Ammunition Ordinance&quot;, &quot;Any portable device which is designed or adapted to stun or disable a person by means of an electric shock applied either with or without direct contact with that person&quot; is considered an &quot;arm&quot; and therefore, the importation, possession and exportation of Taser devices requires a license from the Hong Kong Police Force. They are otherwise illegal, and violation carries penalties up to a $100,000 fine and 14 years in jail.

=== Iceland ===
Use of Taser devices is generally prohibited in Iceland.

=== Ireland ===
Specialist units of Ireland&#x27;s national police force (Garda Síochána) use the X26 model; Special Detective Unit, Emergency Response Unit and Armed Support Units. Issuing Taser CEWs to all members of the force (who are generally unarmed) was under consideration as of 2013. Use of Taser CEWs in Ireland by private individuals is prohibited.

=== Israel ===

The Israeli police have approved using Taser devices. As of 16 February 2009, the first Taser CEWs became available to police units.

Israeli Defense Force first usage

Taser devices were first used by the Israeli Defense Force by the former special counter-terror unit Force 100 in 2004. The unit was disbanded in 2006. Taser CEWs are expected to re-enter operational use by the Israeli Defense Forces in the near future.

As of August 18, 2013, the use of Taser devices by Israeli police was temporarily suspended by Police Chief Yohanan Danino; after such instruments were used repeatedly and excessively by police against a person who allegedly was unarmed and who was not resisting a warranted arrest. But two weeks later the Taser CEW was unsuspended.

===Japan===
Under the Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law, import, carrying, purchase and use of stun guns or tasers is currently completely prohibited in Japan.

=== Kenya ===
Under Kenya&#x27;s Firearms Act, a Taser device is considered a firearm, as per section 2 (a) (ii) of the Act. The section offers one of the descriptions for a firearm as &quot;a lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged or which can be adapted for the discharge of any shot, bullet or other missile and includes ... an electrical charge which when it strikes any person or animal is of sufficient strength to stun and temporarily disable the person or animal struck (such weapon being commonly known as a &#x27;stun gun&#x27; or &#x27;electronic paralyser&#x27; &quot;.

=== Malaysia ===
Royal Malaysia Police are set to become the second in Southeast Asia police force after Singapore Police Force to use the less-lethal Taser X26 CEW. The Taser X26 CEW that Malaysian police bought comes with a holster and uses a non-rechargeable lithium battery able to deliver 195 cartridge shots. Policemen on rounds are issued four cartridges. The Taser devices were issued to policemen in Petaling Jaya, Dang Wangi in Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru.

=== New Zealand ===

A large-scale and generally well received trial by the New Zealand Police saw Taser devices presented almost 800 times and fired over 100 times, but firing was &quot;ineffective&quot; about a third of the time. The Taser device had been &quot;unintentionally discharged&quot; more often than they had been used properly in the line of duty.

In October 2012, police said the TASER device had been &quot;very successful in de-escalating dangerous and potentially life-threatening situations&quot;. Since their introduction, TASER CEWs had been presented 1320 times but only fired 212 times, resulting in 13 injuries. In July 2015, the Police Commissioner announced that TASER CEWs would be routinely carried by all police officers.

===Russia===
Stun guns and tasers are made in Russia can be purchased for self-defense without special permission, however, under the Federal Law No. 150 &quot;On Weapons&quot; of the Russian Federation it&#x27;s illegal to import and subsequent sale of any foreign stun devices or tasers into the country. The ban has been in place since the first version of the law was approved in 1996.

=== South Korea ===
Requires a permit to manufacture, distribute, purchase or carry an electroshock weapon. Any electroshock devices with a projectile (TASER devices) are completely banned for civilian use.

=== Sweden ===
Taser devices and other electronic control devices are considered firearms in Sweden and are banned for civilian use. The Swedish Police Authority had purchased a limited quantity of Taser CEWs, and was about to initiate field trials when these were cancelled in 2005 after an ethics commission found that the need for (and risks of) such devices was not firmly established. The purchased Taser CEWs were then donated to Finland, where field trials were initiated. Since January 1, 2018, the Swedish police have been conducting tests with electroshock weapons for a two-year period and during the trial period approximately 700 police officers are trained. The move has been welcomed by the country&#x27;s union for law enforcement.

=== United Kingdom ===

TASER CEWs are considered &quot;prohibited weapons&quot; under the Firearms Act 1968 and possession or construction is an offence. The maximum sentence for possession is ten years in prison and an unlimited fine. There is a minimum sentence of 5 years imprisonment if the TASER device is disguised as another object such as a torch or a mobile phone.

A related clause being considered for addition to &quot;The Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act&quot; would make electronic components, assemblies and other devices that can be adapted or assembled to build an improvized CEW, as well as the schematic diagrams for them illegal in the UK. This would include for example HV generator modules that generate over 2KV unloaded which would also cover items like CCFL driver modules, laptop backlight PCBs, car ionizers, TV cold cathode driver boards, photomultiplier drivers, night vision devices and plasma globes. The issue here is that such a far reaching Act would be detrimental to legitimate repair companies, scientists and hobbyists and do very little to deter criminals.

TASER CEWs are now used by some British police as a &quot;less lethal&quot; weapon. It was also announced in July 2007, that the deployment of TASER devices by specially trained police units who are not firearms officers, but who are facing similar threats of violence, would be trialled in ten police forces. The 12-month trial commenced on 1 September 2007, and took place in the following forces: Avon &amp; Somerset, Devon &amp; Cornwall, Gwent, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Metropolitan Police, Northamptonshire, Northumbria, North Wales and West Yorkshire.

Following the completion of the trial, the Home Secretary agreed on 24 November 2008 to allow chief police officers of all forces in England and Wales, from 1 December 2008, to extend TASER CEW use to specially trained units in accordance with current Association of Chief Police Officers policy and guidance, which states that TASER CEWs can be used only where officers would be facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves, and/or the subject(s).

Also, in Scotland Strathclyde Police agreed in February 2010 to arm 30 specially trained police officers using the TASER X26 CEW. The pilot would last three months and would be deployed in Glasgow City Centre and Rutherglen.

A fund for up to 10,000 additional TASER devices is being made available for individual chief police officers to bid for TASER devices based on their own operational requirements.

=== United States ===
Court cases in recent years have addressed the legality of TASER CEW use by police officers. In &quot;Bryan v. MacPherson&quot;, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a TASER CEW had been used in a way that constituted excessive force and hence a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the latter case &quot;Mattos v. Agarano&quot;, the same Court of Appeals found that in two situations involving TASER CEW use, one in drive-stun and one in dart mode, officers had used excessive force. According to an article in &quot;Police Chief&quot; magazine, this decision implies guidelines for the use of TASER CEWs and other Electronic Control Devices in gaining compliance (in a setting where safety is not an issue), including that the officer must give warning before each application, and that the suspect must be capable of compliance, with enough time to consider a warning, and to recover from the extreme pain of any prior application of the TASER device; and that TASER devices must not be used on children, the elderly, and women who are visibly pregnant or inform the officer of their pregnancy.

In 1991, an electroshock device supplied by Tasertron to the Los Angeles Police Department failed to subdue Rodney King—even after he was shocked twice with the device—causing officers to believe he was on PCP. Its lack of effectiveness was blamed on a possible battery problem.

==== Legality ====
TASER devices are considered the same as firearms by the United States government for the purposes of the Second Amendment protection, the right to keep and bear arms. They can be legally carried (concealed or openly) without a permit in almost every state. Their use in Connecticut, Illinois, and Wisconsin is legal with restrictions.

In March 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;Caetano v. Massachusetts&quot; that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court erred in its rationale in upholding a law that prohibited the possession of stun guns. Though the decision didn&#x27;t explicitly rule that stun gun bans are unconstitutional, it created doubt in laws forbidding their possession which led to many legal challenges and subsequent legalization of stun gun possession in previously prohibitive jurisdictions.

, some local jurisdictions retain bans on stun guns.

===== Hawaii =====
Hawaii&#x27;s 1976 ban on stun guns was challenged in at least two lawsuits. As a result, the legislature passed HB891, legalizing stun guns in Hawaii as of January 1, 2022. A permit is not required but sellers must perform background checks and provide safety training.

===== Massachusetts =====
Previously, the U.S. Supreme Court had overruled the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in the &quot;Caetano&quot; case. However, when the case was remanded, the state dismissed the charges, thus allowing it to retain its ban on stun guns at the time. The law remained in force but was challenged in a separate lawsuit. On April 17, 2018, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, in &quot;Ramirez v. Commonwealth&quot;, ruled that the state&#x27;s 2004 ban on stun guns is unconstitutional.

===== Michigan =====
In 2012, Michigan&#x27;s ban on stun guns was ruled unconstitutional by the Michigan Court of Appeals.

===== New Jersey =====
On November 15, 2016, it was reported that New Jersey&#x27;s Attorney General Christopher Porrino had conceded that the state&#x27;s 1985 ban on stun guns is unconstitutional. On April 26, 2017, the lawsuit was settled by agreeing that the ban was unconstitutional and to promulgate regulations to allow for the possession of stun guns. The regulations allow for people over 18 to purchase stun guns, effective October 20, 2017.

===== New York =====
New York&#x27;s ban on stun guns is being challenged by Matthew Avitabile. On March 22, 2019, the ban was ruled unconstitutional by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. But it was ruled constitutional by a state court on October 15, 2019.

===== Rhode Island =====
Rhode Island&#x27;s ban on stun guns was ruled unconstitutional in March 2022.

===== Washington D.C. =====
On September 29, 2016, Washington D.C. announced that it intends on repealing its ban on stun guns in response to a lawsuit. The new law regulating stun guns for persons 18 years or older took effect on May 19, 2017. Metropolitan Police Department issued a statement about the legality of stun guns.

===== Virgin Islands =====
The United States Virgin Islands repealed its stun gun ban in 2016.

===== Wisconsin =====
In legalizing concealed carry of firearms in 2011, Wisconsin also legalized stun gun possession for people with a license.

===== Localities within states =====

====== Chicago ======
Chicago bans the sale of stun guns within its limits and imposes an application requirement followed by a 120-day waiting period for attempting to purchase a stun gun from outside the city. Illinois law requires licensure prior to possessing a stun gun in addition to several other restrictions. On March 21, 2019, the Supreme Court of Illinois ruled unanimously that the ban on possession or carriage of stun guns in public is facially unconstitutional. It ruled that a section of law which prohibits the carrying or transportation of stun guns is unconstitutional because an exception against the prohibition (possessing a concealed carry permit) only covers handguns, thus there is no exception for stun guns, and therefore the ban is unconstitutional. This leaves stun gun carriage legal without a permit.

====== Delaware localities ======
Newark&#x27;s 2012 ban on stun guns was repealed on February 24, 2020. New Castle County and Wilmington retain their bans.

====== Iowa localities ======
Crawford County and Denison city (which is within Crawford County) ban stun guns.

====== New Orleans ======
New Orleans&#x27; ban on stun guns was challenged in November 2016 and was eventually repealed on April 3, 2017.

====== Overland Park ======
Overland Park, Kansas repealed its stun gun ban in 2014.

<text>Frederic William Goudy ( ; March 8, 1865 – May 11, 1947) was an American printer, artist and type designer whose typefaces include Copperplate Gothic, Goudy Old Style and Kennerley. He was one of the most prolific of American type designers and his self-named type continues to be one of the most popular in America.

== Biography ==
Frederic William Goudy was born on March 8, 1865, in Bloomington, Illinois.

Goudy was not always a type designer. &quot;At 40, this short, plump, pinkish, and puckish gentleman kept books for a Chicago realtor, and considered himself a failure. During the next 36 years, starting almost from scratch at an age when most men are permanently set in their chosen vocations, he cut 113 fonts of type, thereby creating more usable faces than did the seven greatest inventors of type and books, from Gutenberg to Garamond.&quot;

Asked how to say his name, he told &quot;The Literary Digest&quot; &quot;When I was a boy my father spelled our name &#x27;Gowdy&#x27; which didn&#x27;t offer any particular reason for verbal gymnastics. Later learning that the old Scots spelling was &#x27;Goudy,&#x27; he changed to that form, while I, for some years, retained the old way. My brother in Chicago still spells with the &quot;w&quot;. However, I find that occasionally a stranger pronounces the word with &quot;ou&quot; as long &quot;o&quot; in &quot;go&quot;, sometimes as &quot;ou&quot; in &quot;soup&quot;, or &quot;goo&quot; and less frequently with the &quot;ou&quot; as &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;good&quot;. I retain the original pronunciation with &quot;ou&quot; as in &quot;out&quot;.&quot;
After teaching lettering and becoming known as an advertising designer in Chicago, Goudy built his reputation as a type designer. In 1895 he founded his printing shop, Booklet Press (later renamed Camelot Press). Goudy designed his first typeface, Camelot, in 1896. In 1903, Goudy and Will Ransom founded the Village Press in Park Ridge, Illinois. The typeface used for the Village Press, dubbed &quot;Village&quot; was originally created in 1903 for the Chicago clothing manufacturer, Kuppenheimer &amp; Company. This venture was modeled on the Arts and Crafts movement ideals of William Morris, whose Golden Type many of Goudy&#x27;s earliest designs echo. It was moved to Boston, and then New York. In 1908, he created his first significant typeface for the Lanston Monotype Machine Company: E-38, sometimes known as Goudy Light. However, in that same year the Village Press burned to the ground, destroying all of his equipment and designs. In 1911, Goudy produced his first &quot;hit&quot;, Kennerley Old Style, for an H. G. Wells anthology published by Mitchell Kennerley. This success was followed by Goudy&#x27;s release of the titling letter Forum. Both Kennerley and Forum were cut for private use. Although Goudy was one of the first type designers to become established without working for a foundry, the American Type Founders Company (ATF) became interested in Goudy after his release of Kennerley and Forum. ATF commissioned Goudy to create a typeface. Goudy agreed &quot;on the condition that his original drawings would not be subjected to interference by the founder&#x27;s drawing room&quot;. This commission would become Goudy Old Style. Goudy Old Style was released in 1915 and became an instant success. (cite) It was well suited for newspaper&#x27;s advertising sections because of its efficient use of space. ATF continued to expand the Goudy &#x27;family&#x27; to Goudy Title in 1917, Goudy Bold in 1920, Goudy Catalogue in 1921, Goudy Handtooled in 1922 and Goudy Extrabold in 1927. Goudy types were clearly very lucrative for ATF, but Goudy did not receive anything because he had sold his original design for $1,500 instead of entering into a royalty agreement. ATF&#x27;s refusal to give Goudy compensation for the success of the Goudy family led to the deterioration of Goudy&#x27;s relationship with ATF. The only other typefaces Goudy designed for ATF was Goudytype, and series of initial letters, named Cloister Initials.

From 1920 to 1947, Goudy was art director for Lanston Monotype. Although he continued to design for Monotype throughout this period, Goudy withdrew to his workshop in Marlborough, New York, which he dubbed the Village Letter Foundery. Goudy withdrew partly because he believed that the methods the Monotype firm used to transfer his designs to matrices compromised his work. &quot;All of Goudy&#x27;s types were drawn freehand, without the use of compass, straightedge or French curve.&quot;(cite) It was at the Village Letter Foundery (his workshop) that Goudy created the majority of his prolific work. In 1939, the Village Letter Foundery was destroyed by fire and much of his work was lost. Two of his most successful designs created for Monotype, Deepdene and Goudy Text, were not destroyed. Beginning in 1927, Goudy was a vice-president of the Continental Type Founders Association, which distributed many of his faces.

Goudy was widely known from 1915 to 1940 mainly because of the success of his typefaces, but also because he gave many lectures and speeches on &quot;the great love he had for letter forms&quot;. Goudy was known to rarely turn down a speaking engagement. In 1940 he was appointed lecturer at Syracuse University&#x27;s S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. An excerpt from a lecture he gave to the annual convention of the International Club of Printing House Craftsmen in New York in 1939 highlights Goudy&#x27;s practicality and love for letterform. &quot;My craft is a simple one. For nearly forty years I have endeavored constantly to create a greater and more general esteem for good printing and typography, to give printers and reader of print more legible and more beautiful types than were hitherto available.&quot; By the end of his life, Goudy had designed 122 typefaces and published 59 literary works. He worked extensively with his wife Bertha M. Goudy, who particularly collaborated with him on printing projects in which she acted as a compositor of type. The couple had a son, Frederic T. Goudy.

It has been claimed that Goudy was the originator of the well-known statement, &quot;Anyone who would letterspace lowercase would steal sheep.&quot;

== Typefaces ==

Goudy was the third most prolific designer of metal type in the United States (behind Morris Fuller Benton and R. Hunter Middleton), with ninety faces actually cut and cast, and many more designs completed. His most famous were Copperplate Gothic and Goudy Old Style. Besides printing, he also worked on numerous hand-lettering projects (especially early in his career) and created a large set of ampersands for an article on the topic.

Goudy&#x27;s career was influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement and the growth of fine book printing in the United States. At a time when printing types had become quite mechanical and geometric under the influence of Didone designs such as Bodoni, Goudy spent his career developing old-style serifs often influenced by the printing of the Italian Renaissance and calligraphy, with a characteristic warmth and irregularity. His neighbour, Eric Sloane, recalled that he also took inspiration from hand-painted signs. In contrast to his great contemporary Morris Fuller Benton, he generally avoided sans-serif designs, though he did create the nearly sans-serif Copperplate Gothic, inspired by engraved letters, early in his career and a few others later. As a result, many of his designs may look quite similar to modern readers. He also developed a number of typefaces influenced by blackletter medieval manuscripts, illuminated manuscript capitals and Roman capitals engraved in stone. Some of his most famous designs such as Copperplate Gothic and Goudy Stout are unusual deviations from his normal style. His sans-serif series, Goudy Sans, adopts an eccentric humanist style with a calligraphic italic. Quite unlike most sans-serif types of the period, it was unpopular in his lifetime but revived several times since.

As an independent artist and consultant, Goudy needed to undertake a large range of commissions to survive, and sought patronage from companies who would commission a typeface for their own printing and advertising. This led to him producing a large range of designs on commission, and promoting his career through talks and teaching. As a result, many of his designs may look quite similar to modern readers. His career was aided by the new pantograph engraving technology, which made it easier to rapidly cut the matrices used as moulds to form metal type. This was a considerable advance on the traditional method of cutting punches manually at the size of the letter to be printed, which would be stamped into metal to form the matrix. An additional boon to his career was the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period which created increasing availability and demand for new fonts.

While most of his designs are &#x27;old-style&#x27; serif faces, they do still explore a wide range of aspects of the genre, with Deepdene offering a strikingly upright italic, Goudy Modern merging traditional old-style letters with the insistent, horizontal serifs of Didone faces of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and Goudy Old Style being sold with a swash italic for display use. Goudy kept records of his work (though most of these do not survive due to the fire), giving his typefaces numbers for his own use in a similar way to the opus numbers used by composers. Almost uniquely for type designers of the metal type era, he wrote extensively on his work, including a thorough commentary on each of his designs late in life.

The printer Daniel Berkeley Updike, while respecting some of his work (at least publicly), echoed Goudy&#x27;s student Dwiggins&#x27; comment that his work lacked &#x27;a certain snap and acidity&#x27;, and apparently somewhat snobbishly disliked Goudy&#x27;s aggressive seeking after work and reputation. He also wrote that Goudy had &quot;never gotten over&quot; a desire to imitate medieval books. The British printer Stanley Morison, also a veteran of fine book printing whose career at Monotype had moved in the direction of blending tradition with practicality, admired much of Goudy&#x27;s work and ethos but also wrote sarcastically in private letters to Updike that Goudy had &quot;designed a whole century of very peculiar looking types&quot;, and that he was glad that his company&#x27;s Times New Roman did not look &quot;as if it has been designed by somebody in particular – Mr. Goudy for instance.&quot; Goudy felt in his later life that his career had been overshadowed by new trends, with modernism and a trend towards sharper geometric design making his work out of favor. Walter Tracy described Goudy as &quot;over-fond&quot; of the &#x27;e&#x27; with a tilted centre common in fifteenth-century printing which he felt added an &quot;unwanted restlessness&quot; to many of his type designs.
In 1938 he designed University of California Old Style, for the sole proprietary use of the University of California Press. The Lanston Monotype Company released a version of this typeface as &quot;Californian&quot; for wider distribution in 1956, while ITC created a well-known adaptation (and expansion) called Berkeley Old Style or ITC Berkeley, in 1983.

William T. LaMoy, a curator at Syracuse University, discovered two sets of matrices (metal molds) and associated paperwork in Syracuse University Library&#x27;s archives for a font known as Sherman, which the publisher Frederic Fairchild Sherman had commissioned from Goudy in 1910. LaMoy published an article about this discovery in 2013, explaining how, in the 1960s, Sherman&#x27;s niece bequeathed the font to Syracuse University because she was aware of Goudy&#x27;s connection to the university. Indeed, in 1934, Syracuse University had awarded Goudy an honorary degree and, from the journalism school, a typographic medal for excellence. Recently Syracuse University adopted and digitized the Sherman typeface and is now using it for official publications. Called the Sherman Serif Book, it is a proprietary font for Syracuse University.

== Legacy ==
 The Cary Graphic Arts Collection, a rare book library and archive at the Rochester Institute of Technology, sponsors the Frederic W. Goudy Award. It is awarded annually to outstanding practitioners in the field of typography, including previous recipients Hermann Zapf, Ed Benguiat, and Kris Holmes.

The Cary Collection also houses the Albion iron hand press No. 6551—or the &quot;Kelmscott/Goudy Press,&quot; so named because it was first owned by William Morris, then later by Frederic Goudy. The press is on permanent display at the Cary Collection and is preserved through active use in classes, workshops, and other activities.

<text>Big mama () is a Chinese language neologism for an Internet censor on web bulletin board systems in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Big mamas are human censors and moderators on different online platforms who remove politically sensitive information, comments and postings on news forums and chatrooms. The Chinese government also has a team of censors and internet police to monitor internet content; however, it is not possible for them to control the whole internet. Yale Global calls all Chinese censors, including the internet police, big mamas. However, big mamas are generally understood as censors working in the private sector. Private sector companies have a market interest to self-censor their websites and users&#x27; comments to fall in line with the Chinese government&#x27;s internet goals, economic and industrial Chinese development. Private companies use many technologies to censor themselves and their users, one of which is hiring teams of computer workers and programmers, called big mamas, to censor the content of website forums, chatrooms, comment sections and bulletin board systems. Big mamas are prevalent across many companies and have led to a larger discourse on censorship that can be compared to the Western idea of Big Brother on a smaller scale.

==Technology and process==

A study of the site Sina Weibo, a microblogging site, was conducted by BBC to see how quickly censors removed material and gain insight about big mamas. The study concluded many things including that those who are censored often are censored at a faster rate. Around 90% of politically risky content is removed in the first 24 hours, 5% within 8 minutes and 30% in the first half hour. It also concluded just for the site Sina Weibo, a social media platform, there would have to be at least 4,000 monitors if none of the process was automated. The job of big mamas is becoming more automated as technology becomes more advanced.

China has allowed foreign companies to be part of the market and has relied on foreign technologies and companies to maintain censorship.

==Examples==
China has allowed foreign companies to invest and be part of the Chinese internet. In order to maintain a piece of the market these foreign companies, like Yahoo, follow Chinese censorship regulations, often by hiring big mamas to monitor bulletin board content.

Yahoo is the most common example of a private company in China that uses big mamas. The chatrooms are censored in real time; when someone posts a politically risky comment big mamas send them an email warning from Yahoo and their post cannot be seen by others. Yahoo in 2002 signed a Public Pledge on Self-discipline (known as The Pledge) promising to regulate chatrooms in line with the Chinese governments laws and regulations. Approximately 300 other companies signed this pledge, many of which also use big mamas and other technologies to censor users and information. All chatrooms and bulletin board systems and news agencies in Chinese cyberspace have a big mama that decide what content is acceptable and what content needs removed.

==Self-censorship==
The role of big mamas can be compared to the western concept of Big Brother. The pressure of self-regulation on private web companies from the government and market encourages them to self-censor and censor their users. The Pledge is an example of self-discipline and censorship that has been codified and signed by many web companies in China. The Pledge promised to remove harmful information from the internet.

The censorship by companies of their chatrooms and bulletin boards has led their users to censor themselves to avoid being censored or punished. Lokman Tsui, who has written about big mamas, calls this concept the digital panopticon. Every level of a network regulates itself and censors the level below; this works all the way down to big mamas who moderate chatrooms down to users who regulate each-other&#x27;s behavior.

Big mama has created a discourse of self-censorship and control; as Lokman Tsui wrote &quot;Big Mama is watching you&quot;. When users censor themselves at a smaller level it is more effective than direct censorship from the top. Big mamas have led to both societal and self-censorship that is beyond government-controlled top-down censorship.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the name for the wife of the eldest uncle, who in traditional Chinese families has the responsibility to take care of everyone. Big mamas act quite openly and are not reluctant to admit the fact that they are censoring and why they are doing so. The actions of big mamas are generally taken more with annoyance and amusement than with alarm, and there is often some humorous bantering with big mama.

<text>Kreis Birnbaum () was a district in Prussia (&quot;Kreis&quot;) in the west of the Grand Duchy of Posen and the succeeding Province of Posen, as part of &quot;Regierungsbezirk&quot; Posen between 1815 and 1920. Today the area belongs to the Polish voivodeships of Greater Poland and Lubusz.

==History==
The lands around the Greater Polish town of Międzychód had been part of the Poznań Voivodeship since the 14th century, they were annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia during the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Part of Napoleon&#x27;s titular Duchy of Warsaw from 1807, it was returned to Prussia at the 1815 Congress of Vienna. The district&#x27;s borders were finally determined by resolution of 1818. The administrative seat from 1833 was at Zirke, from 1867 in Birnbaum itself.

Along with the Province of Posen, &quot;Kreis Birnbaum&quot; became part of the German Empire in 1871. With effect of 1 October 1887, its westernmost part, including Schwerin an der Warthe and Blesen was separated as &quot;Kreis Schwerin an der Warthe&quot;.

In the aftermath of the German collapse on the Western Front in World War I, the Treaty of Versailles awarded most of the province, including &quot;Kreis Birnbaum&quot;, to the new state of Poland. The handover was executed by between 17 January and 4 February 1920.

== Demographics ==
Before the bifurcation of the district in 1887, it had a German majority population. According to the Prussian census of 1860, it had a population of 45,425, of which 34,608 (76.2%) were Germans and 10,817 (23.8%) were Poles. The district population, after the separation of the predominantly German Kreis Schwerin was almost evenly split among Germans and Poles.
==Police districts==
In 1833 the office of a &quot;Wójt&quot; (&quot;Vogt&quot;, reeve) was established in the districts of the predominantly Polish-settled Grand Duchy of Posen, a voluntary administrator who often was a member of the local nobility. However, in the course of the Prussian Germanisation policies under Governor Eduard Heinrich von Flottwell, they were replaced by Prussian commissioners. In 1905, the municipalities in &quot;Kreis Birnbaum&quot; were governed within three police districts (&quot;Polizeidistrikte&quot;):
*Birnbaum
*Orzeschkowo
*Zirke
The administrative seats of Birnbaum and Zirke themselves were not incorporated.

==Court system==
The district court (&quot;Landgericht&quot;) was in Meseritz, with the lower court () in Birnbaum.

<text>The district of Bomst was a Prussian district which existed from 1793 to 1807 in the province of South Prussia and from 1815 to 1938 successively in the Grand Duchy of Posen, the Province of Posen and the Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia. The district capital was Wollstein.

== History ==
After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the area around the towns of Bomst and Wollstein formed the &quot;Bomst district&quot; in the Prussian province of South Prussia. Through the Treaties of Tilsit, the Bomst district became part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807. After the Congress of Vienna, the district became part of the Grand Duchy of Posen in 1815, which became the Prussian Province of Posen in 1848. The province of Posen belonged to the newly founded German Empire from 18 January 1871.

In the course of district reforms, on 1 January 1818, the Bomst district ceded the area around the town of Neutomischel to the Buk district and the area around the town of Bentschen to the Meseritz district. In return, it received the area around Priment from the Fraustadt district.

On 27 December 1918 the Greater Poland uprising began in the province of Posen, and by the beginning of January 1919 the eastern part of the Bomst district was under Polish control. On 16 February 1919 an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting, and on 28 June 1919, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the German government officially ceded the eastern two-thirds of the Bomst district to Poland. The western part of the Bomst district remained in Germany and became part of the Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia.

On 1 October 1938 the Bomst district was dissolved. The northern part of the district with the towns of Bomst and Unruhstadt was transferred to the district of Züllichau-Schwiebus in the Province of Brandenburg, while the southern part of the district was transferred to the district of Grünberg in the Province of Lower Silesia.

== Demographics ==
The Bomst district had a mixed population of Germans and Poles. The population of the district was almost evenly split between Germans and Poles. After the border change in 1919, in the part of the district that remained in Germany, there was a substantial Polish minority of 20.6% according to the 1925 census.
== Elections ==
The Bomst district together with the Meseritz district formed the &quot;Posen 3&quot; parliamentary constituency. In the Reichstag elections of the German Empire between 1871 and 1912, the following members were elected:

* 1871: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1874: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1877: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1878: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1881: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1884: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1887: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1890: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1893: Hans Wilhelm von Unruhe-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1898: Stephan von Dziembowski-Bomst, Free Conservative Party
* 1903: Hans Otto von Gersdorff, German Conservative Party
* 1907: Hans Otto von Gersdorff, German Conservative Party
* 1912: Kuno von Westarp, German Conservative Party

<text>The Territory of Nebraska was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from May 30, 1854, until March 1, 1867, when the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Nebraska. The Nebraska Territory was created by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. The territorial capital was Omaha. The territory encompassed areas of what is today Nebraska, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Colorado, and Montana.

==History==
An enabling act was passed by the Congress of the United States in 1864. Delegates for a constitutional convention were elected; this convention did not produce a constitution. Two years later, in 1866, a constitution was drafted and voted upon. It was approved by 100 votes. However, a clause in this constitution that limited suffrage to &quot;free white males&quot; delayed Nebraska&#x27;s entry into the Union for almost a year. The 1866 enabling act for the state was subject to a pocket veto by Democratic Party / War Democrat and new 17th President Andrew Johnson 1808-1875, served 1865-1869), When the Congress reconvened in 1867, it passed another bill to create the new 37th state of Nebraska, on the condition that Nebraska&#x27;s new proposed first state constitution be amended to remove the suffrage clause. This bill was also vetoed by President Johnson. The then dominant Republican Party-controlled by Radical Republicans in the Congress, then overrode his veto, with the required two-thirds super majority..
===Early settlement===

Several trading posts, forts and towns were established in the previous area of the original Louisiana Purchase of 1803, abd the organization of the subsequent Louisiana Territory  (1804-1812) and the following Missouri Territory of 1812-1821 (until admission of Missouri as the xx state that year of 1821, in the southeastern corner of the former larger territory. Later decades saw the new Western lands as temporarily unorganized federal territory between the Mississippi River in the east across the Great Plains to the far western Rocky Mountains. That status endured for 33 years from 1821 to the establishment of new official federal territories for Kansas Territory and the one further north in the Nebraska lands, both in 1854. 

From the early 19th century through 1867, including Fontenelle&#x27;s Post founded in the present-day site of Bellevue in 1806. It was first mentioned in fur trading records in 1823. Fort Lisa, founded by Manuel Lisa (1772-1820), (near present-day Dodge Park in North Omaha), was founded in 1812, although Lisa had earlier founded posts further up the upper Missouri River in future Dakota Territory (North Dakota) and Montana Territory (Montana). Fort Atkinson, was founded on the Council Bluff in 1819; in 1822 Cabanne&#x27;s Trading Post was founded nearby on the Missouri River. Mormon (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) settlers founded Cutler&#x27;s Park in 1846, and the town of Bellevue was incorporated in 1853. Nearby Omaha City was founded in 1854, with Nebraska City and Kearney incorporated in 1855. The influential towns of Brownville and Fontanelle were founded that year as well. The early village of Lancaster, (later called and renamed Lincoln), was founded in 1856, along with the towns of Saratoga, South Nebraska City and Florence.

===Early press===
The first newspaper published in the terrain that would become Nebraska Territory and following 37th State of Nebraska, was a weekly military journal stationed at the United States Army post of Fort Atkinson that was published for five years, from 1822 to 1827, before the fort was closed. Thirty years later the Nebraska Territory was being settled and print media appeared serving the dual purposes of sharing the news and promoting the area for further settlement. In 1854, one of the first was the &quot;Nebraska Palladium&quot; (and &quot;Platte Valley Advocate&quot;). was the first newspaper to be printed / published in the territory; however, it would last less than a year. These territorial newspapers were efficient but rough and many of the papers folded under quickly changed owners, financial stability or consolidated with other publications. By 1860, the growing Nebraska Territory had twelve weekly publications, one biweekly and one monthly, with a combined circulation of 9,750. After statehood in 1867 the newspaper business expanded greatly.


===Early military posts===
With a variety of early fur trading posts, Fort Atkinson, founded in 1819, was the location of the first military post in what became the Nebraska Territory, as well as its first school. Other posts in the Nebraska Territory included Fort Kearny near present-day Kearney; Fort McPherson near present-day Maxwell; Fort Mitchell near present-day Scottsbluff; Fort Randall, in what is now South Dakota; and Fort Caspar, Fort Halleck, Fort Laramie, and Fort Sanders, in what is now Wyoming.
==Boundaries==
The Nebraska Territory&#x27;s original boundaries (as specified by its Organic Act) included much of the original Louisiana Purchase; the territory&#x27;s boundaries were:
* Southern: 40° N (the current Kansas–Nebraska border);
* Western: the Continental Divide between the Pacific and the Atlantic/Arctic Oceans;
* Northern: 49° N (the U.S.–British North America border);
* Eastern: the White Earth and Missouri rivers.

===Subsequent territory creation===
Upon creation, the territory encompassed most of the northern Great Plains, much of the upper Missouri River basin and the eastern portions of the northern Rocky Mountains. The Nebraska Territory gradually reduced in size as new territories were created in the 1860s.

The Colorado Territory was formed February 28, 1861 from portions of the territory south of 41° N and west of 102°03′ W (25° W of Washington, D.C.) (an area that includes present-day Fort Collins, Greeley and the portions of Boulder north of Baseline Road, in addition to portions of Kansas Territory, New Mexico Territory, and Utah Territory).

March 2, 1861, saw the creation of the Dakota Territory. It was made of all of the portions of Nebraska Territory north of 43° N (the present-day Nebraska–South Dakota border), along with the portion of present-day Nebraska between 43° N and the Keya Paha and Niobrara rivers (this land would be returned to Nebraska in 1882). The act creating the Dakota Territory also included provisions granting Nebraska small portions of Utah Territory and Washington Territory—present-day southwestern Wyoming bounded by 41° N, 110°03′ W (33° W of Washington, D.C.), 43° N, and the Continental Divide. These portions had not been part of the Louisiana Purchase; rather, they had been part of Oregon Country and became part of the United States in 1846.

On March 3, 1863, the Idaho Territory was formed of all the territory west of 104°03′ W (27° W of Washington, D.C.).

<text>Nibbles, also known by the source code&#x27;s file name &quot;NIBBLES.BAS&quot;, is a variant of the snake video game concept used to demonstrate the QBasic programming language. &quot;Nibbles&quot; was written in QBasic by Rick Raddatz, who later went on to create small businesses such as Xiosoft and Bizpad.

==Gameplay==
The game&#x27;s objective is to navigate a virtual snake through a walled space while consuming numbers (from 1 through 9) along the way. The player must avoid colliding with walls, other snakes or their own snake. Since the length of the snake increases with each number consumed, the game becomes more difficult over time. After the last number has been eaten, the player progresses to the next level, with more complex obstacles and increased speed. There is a multiplayer mode which allows a second player to control a second snake by using a different set of keys on the same keyboard.

==Development==
Nibbles was included with MS-DOS version 5.0 and above. Written in QBasic, it is one of the programs included as a demonstration of that programming language. The QBasic game uses the standard 80x25 text screen to emulate an 80x50 grid by making clever use of foreground and background colors, and the ANSI characters for full blocks and half-height blocks. Microsoft&#x27;s 24kB QBasic version was copyrighted in 1990. Due to MS-DOS&#x27;s prevalence at the time, it was available on almost every IBM PC compatible in the early 1990s.

<text>The Expediency Discernment Council of the System ( &quot;Majma&#x27;-e Tašxis-e Maslahat-e Nezâm&quot;) is an administrative assembly of Iran appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but &quot;its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.&quot; According to Hooman Majd, the Leader &quot;delegated some of his own authority to the council—granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government&quot; following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s election in 2005.

Members of the council are chosen by the Supreme Leader every five years.

==History and role==
By 1987, the legislative process as well as the country&#x27;s long-term policy formation had come to a standstill due to the doctrinal conflict between radical factions of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the Guardian Council, which officials described as coercive at the time. Consultations in February the following year led to Ayatollah Khomeini ordering the appointment of a 13-member council that was given legislative authority: it could pass temporary laws (effective for three-year periods). Article 112 of Iran&#x27;s Constitution states the EDC will be convened by the Supreme Leader to determine expedience cases where the Guardian Council finds an Islamic Consultative Assembly decision against the principles of religious law or the constitution, and where the Consultative Assembly is unable to satisfy the Guardian Council in view of the expedience of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Formally, the Expediency Discernment Council of the System (or Regime) is primarily a constitutional advisory body for the Supreme Leader (at the latter&#x27;s behest), as described in article 112 of the Islamic Republic&#x27;s Constitution. It is meant to &quot;discern the interests of the Islamic Republic&quot; by resolving internal regime conflicts. The Council consisted of thirteen members when originally convened, and included six clergy members (appointed by the Supreme Leader), six public officials (President, Prime Minister, Majles Speaker, Supreme Court Chief Justice, Prosecutor General, and a Supreme Leader representative), as well as the Majles member whose legislation was overturned. The EDC Chairman is appointed every five years by the Supreme Leader. Even though the Supreme Leader is a member of the Council itself (and it being his advisory council), he can deputize the Council. Nine years later, in 1997, Khamenei expanded its membership to thirty-four, twenty-five of whom were thence appointed for five-year terms. During February 2007, a new Council was formed, with twenty-seven members being directly chosen by the Supreme Leader this time.

As stated by article 111, if the position of Supreme Leader is undeclared for whatever reason, a council composed of President, head of the Judiciary, and one of the jurisconsults of the Guardian Council chosen by the EDC shall discharge his functions collectively and temporarily. If any of them is unable to discharge his duties, another person shall be appointed by the EDC in his place. The Council also resolves disputes that concern the Guardian Council and the Majles. Domestic and foreign policies of the regime are determined only after consultation with the Expediency Council, according to article 110 of the Constitution (with oversight of the Supreme Leader). The Expediency Council is only meant to act on behalf of the legislative branch, although in reality it intercedes as a mediator between all bureaucratic branches, including the executive. If ratification of the Consultative Assembly is not confirmed by the Guardian Council (and deputies insist on implementing the ratification), the EDC can intervene to make a decision. The Expediency Discernment Council can advise the faghih on policy and strategy (in accordance to article 111 of the Constitution), and despite not being part of the legislative branch, it can remove parliamentary powers. As an example of this, in April 2000 it removed from parliamentary capacity the faculty to investigate institutions under the control of the Supreme Leader, such as the Pasdaran and the Council of the Guardians. In practice, its composition almost guarantees its rulings mirror the legal opinion the Guardian Council, and more importantly, the Supreme Leader&#x27;s. Being dominated by conservative ulama, this has furthered the faction&#x27;s grip over Iran.

During August 2001, the Council was convened by the Supreme Leader to resolve the dispute between the Judiciary and the Assembly. The latter was dominated by reformers, while the former was dominated by conservatives, so the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei wanted the EDC to settle this political confrontation. The confrontation referred to the parliament&#x27;s rejection to approve conservative candidates&#x27; appointments to the Guardian Council. Conservatives did not want to lose control of the Guardian Council, dreading president Mohammad Khatami and reformist allies would push through political and social reforms. Members of the Council are generally ayatollahs and hojatoleslams (a step before ayatollah). In 2005, the capacity of the Council to act as a government supervisory body was supplemented to its powers. The EDC&#x27;s influence grew when cleric Hashemi Rafsanjani joined it.

<doc id="452735" wikidata="Q1292739" url="?curid=452735" title="The Dome at America's Center">
<text>The Dome at America&#x27;s Center is a multi-purpose stadium used for concerts, major conventions, and sporting events in downtown St. Louis, Missouri, United States. Previously known as the Trans World Dome from 1995 to 2001 and the Edward Jones Dome from 2002 to 2016, it was constructed largely to lure a National Football League (NFL) team to St. Louis and to serve as a convention space.

The Dome received its initial main tenant with the arrival of the NFL&#x27;s St. Louis Rams, who relocated to the city in 1995. The Rams spent the next 21 seasons at the Dome, departing after the 2015 NFL season to return to Los Angeles. The St. Louis Battlehawks of the United Football League began playing at the stadium in early 2020, with Battlehawk fans commonly referring to the dome as the BattleDome.
The Dome provides multiple stadium configurations that can seat up to 82,624 people. Seating levels include a private luxury suite level with 120 suites, a private club seat and luxury suite level with 6,400 club seats, a concourse level (lower bowl) with 28,352 seats, and a terrace level (upper bowl) with 29,400.

The Dome is part of the America&#x27;s Center convention center. The convention portion has a much bigger footprint and adjoins to the west of the Dome, Cole Street to the north, Broadway to the east, and Convention Plaza to the south. The stadium is serviced by the Convention Center MetroLink rail station.

==Architecture==
The stadium&#x27;s exterior facade is clad in brick, limestone, and precast concrete tinted to resemble red sandstone. The intended effect was for the venue to less resemble a stadium, and more resemble the look of public libraries and city school buildings built in the era preceding World War II.

==History==
In 1988, the St. Louis Rams left St. Louis for Phoenix, Arizona, leaving St. Louis without a National Football League team. Looking to re-enter the league, St. Louis proposed building a domed stadium for a team to play in and attaching the Dome to the convention center to expand convention center capacity. The funding for the project was accomplished via public bonds beginning in 1989. In 1991, St. Louis put in for an NFL expansion franchise for 1995 called the St. Louis Stallions and began construction on The Dome in 1992. However, in 1993, the league chose Charlotte, North Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida, over St. Louis.

After St. Louis came up short in its expansion bid, it appeared that the city might land a new team anyway. Advertising executive James Orthwein, a St. Louis native and member of the Busch family, bought the New England Patriots in 1992 from Victor Kiam to resolve a debt between the two men. The Patriots had long been in financial malaise since original owner Billy Sullivan, who was still the team president during Kiam&#x27;s ownership, had squandered all of his net worth on a series of bad investments in the mid-1980s and was forced to sell the team to Kiam and Foxboro Stadium to Robert Kraft. Immediately upon purchase, Orthwein made it clear that he wanted to relocate the team from Foxborough, Massachusetts to St. Louis and was to leave New England at the end of the 1993 season. Orthwein&#x27;s plans to move the team however were thwarted when Kraft refused to let Orthwein out of the long-term lease that he had secured from Kiam and Sullivan as part of his purchase of the stadium. Orthwein did not want to own the team if he could not move it, and Kraft initiated a hostile takeover that resulted in his purchase of the Patriots in 1994.

The then under-construction Dome finally received the NFL tenant it was looking for in 1995 when Georgia Frontiere announced she would relocate the Los Angeles Rams to St. Louis for the 1995 season. This move was initially voted down, with 21 opposed, three in favor (the Rams, Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers), and six abstaining. The other owners (led by Buffalo&#x27;s Ralph Wilson, the Jets&#x27; Leon Hess, the Giants&#x27; Wellington Mara, Washington&#x27;s Jack Kent Cooke, Arizona&#x27;s Bill Bidwill and Minnesota&#x27;s John Skoglund) believed that the Rams&#x27; financial problems were caused by Frontiere&#x27;s mismanagement. When Frontiere expressed a possible lawsuit against the league, commissioner Paul Tagliabue acquiesced to Frontiere&#x27;s demands. As part of the relocation deal, the city of St. Louis guaranteed that the stadium&#x27;s amenities would be maintained in the top 25% of all NFL stadiums. After playing their first four home games of the 1995 season at Busch Memorial Stadium because the Dome was not ready, the Rams&#x27; first game in the stadium on Sunday, November 12, 1995, was a 28–17 win over the Carolina Panthers.

===Renovations===

The Dome received a $30 million renovation in 2009, which replaced the scoreboards with LED video displays (one large in north end zone and one smaller in south end zone) and LED fascia boards around the bowl of the Dome. The renovations also added new premium areas (Bud Light Zone and Clarkson Jewelers Club). Some of the paint work in the Dome was lightened as well and painted in Rams colors (Blue, Gold, and White). In 2010, the Rams locker room was re-built and switched ends from the north end zone to the south end zone. For 2011, new HD monitors were installed throughout the Dome in place of the older screens at concession stands and other areas.
Before the 2010 season, the Dome also received a new permanent turf surface. The surface, manufactured by AstroTurf, is AstroTurf&#x27;s Magic Carpet II Conversion System, which features its GameDay 3D Synthetic Turf System. This system is similar to the original turf system that was in the Dome from 1995 to 2004 whereas it can be rolled up and stored underground in a pit at the Dome. The Dome used a FieldTurf brand surface from 2005 to 2009.

===The loss of the Rams (2012–2016)===
The Dome&#x27;s primary problem throughout the years centered on a lease signed by the Rams when they came to St. Louis in 1995. For the first decade, the Dome was considered an adequate facility, but eventually the Rams and city leaders became concerned with the Dome&#x27;s long-term viability.

====The lease and poor rankings====
Under the terms of the lease that the Rams signed in 1995, the Dome was required to be ranked in the top quartile of NFL stadiums through 2015, measured at 10 year intervals. This meant the Dome had to have the proper fan amenities and other features found in modern NFL stadiums. If the building was not ranked in the top quartile, the Rams were free to break the lease and either relocate without penalty or continue to lease the Dome on a year-to-year basis.

Not helping matters was the Dome&#x27;s poor reception with NFL fans and the general public as the years went by. Even after the 2010 renovations many websites ranking the 31 NFL stadiums listed the Dome near the bottom of their respective rankings. In 2008, for a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; poll, St. Louis fans ranked it the worst out of any NFL stadium at the time with particularly low marks for tailgating, affordability and atmosphere. &quot;Time&quot; magazine in May 2012 ranked the Dome as the 7th worst major sports stadium in the United States. The Dome&#x27;s exterior was regarded as an &quot;urban eyesore from the get-go, an ugly multi-purpose dome that&#x27;s one defining feature was its inability to fit into any conceivable cityscape...[that] takes up several city blocks but never developed any reasonable interesting business around it: It has always looked like a huge mall from that sad time in recent American history when cities bragged about how big of a mall they could build&quot;. Inside, the Dome was &quot;too vast and too cavernous to hold a lot of sound...[and] was the sort of building that felt empty even when it was full&quot;, even during the &quot;Greatest Show on Turf&quot; halcyon days of the Rams.

In 2005, the rankings indicated that the Dome was no longer in the top quartile as mandated by the lease, which gave the Rams the right to begin the process of breaking the lease, or reverting to a year-to-year. The Rams, wishing to afford St. Louis ample opportunity to meet the quartile requirement, instead agreed to waive this right for the 2005 checkpoint in return for $30 million of renovations and improvements. However, both the Rams and city leaders realized at this time that long-term, the Dome needed a major overhaul or St. Louis would again risk losing the Rams after 2015. Things were exacerbated further as fan interest began to decline sharply, the mediocrity the team would experience in the waning days of the Greatest Show on Turf contributed heavily to attendance records hitting a new low for the franchise. The Rams placed in the bottom 5 in attendance every season from 2008 to 2015. By 2015, rumors of the team relocating contributed to the Rams finishing dead last in attendance.

====Negotiations====
With the 2015 deadline looming, the Convention and Visitor Center (the stadium&#x27;s operator) and the Rams negotiated throughout 2012 on the renovations and agreed to go into arbitration in 2013 if a deal was not worked out in which three arbitrators mutually agreed on from the American Arbitration Association to arbitrate the case in 2013.

In January 2012, the CVC proposed $48 million in improvements including a new 947-vehicle garage, all funded publicly, with the Rams keeping the garage game-day revenue.
After the Rams rejected the $48 million deal, the CVC next proposed $124 million in renovations including a new three-story structure on Baer Plaza on the east side facing the Mississippi River for a main entrance as well as new suites. This proposal had the Rams picking up $64 million of that project, the CVC citing an approximate percentage of what other NFL teams had chipped in for on similar renovations.
The Rams countered with a $700 million proposal that called for much of the stadium to be rebuilt including a sliding roof panel and a new four-sided center scoreboard, the Rams asserting that this would satisfy the &quot;first tier&quot; top quartile requirement relative to the current NFL stadium landscape. No details on how to pay for the renovations were made. The sides did not hammer out an agreement in 2012 and the matter went into arbitration hearings in January 2013. Officials noted that even if the arbitrators decided on implementing a more expensive plan and the CVC was unable to fund it the Rams would still be able to break the lease.

With no agreement between both sides in 2013 there was considerable speculation on the future of both the Rams and the stadium with some suggesting the Rams could return to Los Angeles. Further pressure for St. Louis to resolve the issue was that bonds for construction of the Dome were still being paid and would continue to be paid through 2021. Missouri was paying $12 million/year and the City and County of St. Louis were each paying $6 million/year.

On February 1, 2013, the arbitrators ruled in favor of the Rams&#x27; $700 million proposal to tear down half the Dome and replace it as the only way among the options presented to bring the Dome up to first-tier status. Various city and county officials said it was unlikely that public funding would be found for such a project. Officials noted that the Rams were contractually obligated to play in the Dome until March 15, 2015, and there was no &quot;buy out&quot; provision to permit the Rams to move before then. City and county officials said they were considering all options including construction of a new stadium elsewhere in the St. Louis area. Rams officials, meanwhile, indicated their preference to stay in St. Louis.

The St. Louis Regional Convention (the stadium&#x27;s owner) and Sports Complex Authority hired Goldman Sachs in February 2013 &quot;to keep the Rams in the Dome, or, if that&#x27;s not possible, to maintain a National Football League team in St. Louis.&quot; An attorney for St. Louis noted that Goldman had &quot;financed or advised on the financing of every NFL stadium recently built.&quot; In April 2013, it was reported by the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that the arrangement was being scrutinized by the Securities and Exchange Commission as new Dodd–Frank rules restricted firms from offering financial advice to municipalities where it also underwrites its municipal bond transactions. Eventually the hiring fell through and nothing resulted from it.

On July 2, 2013, the CVC announced that they were rejecting the Rams&#x27; renovation proposal. Missouri governor Jay Nixon had been negotiating with owner Stan Kroenke since the decision had been made. The earliest the Rams could have broken the lease on the Dome was following the 2014 season, but they chose not to do so in 2014.

====Inglewood purchase====
On January 31, 2014, both the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; reported that Stan Kroenke purchased approximately 60 acres of land adjacent to the Forum in Inglewood, California. Commissioner Roger Goodell represented that Mr. Kroenke informed the league of the purchase. Kroenke subsequently announced plans to build an NFL stadium on the site, in connection with the owners of the adjacent Hollywood Park site, Stockbridge Capital Group. This development further fueled rumors that the Rams intended to return its management and football operations to Southern California. The land was initially targeted for a Walmart Supercenter but Walmart could not get the necessary permits to build it. On January 5, 2015, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Stan Kroenke and Stockbridge Capital Group were partnering up in developing a new NFL stadium on the Inglewood property owned by Kroenke. The project included a stadium with up to 80,000 seats and a performance venue of up to 6,000 seats while reconfiguring the previously approved Hollywood Park plan for up to of retail, of office space, 2,500 new residential units, a 300-room hotel and of public parks, playgrounds, open space and pedestrian and bicycle access. The stadium would likely be ready by 2019.

In lieu of this St. Louis countered with a stadium plan on the north riverfront area of downtown, known as National Car Rental Field, with the hope of persuading Kroenke to keep the Rams in the city. However, on February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium and the initiative with construction planned to begin in December 2015.

This generated further debate between the NFL, St. Louis, and the Rams as to whether the Rams should be allowed to relocate when a &quot;first tier&quot; stadium plan was in process. The NFL and the Rams countered that the stadium plan was developed outside of the agreed-upon lease and &quot;first tier&quot; remediation and arbitration process, and therefore could not be considered a binding factor in preventing the Rams from relocating. In addition, the NFL and the Rams expressed concerns over the funding and maintenance of the proposed stadium, which they felt shifted too much of the costs of construction and maintenance to the Rams organization. Ultimately, as the Inglewood stadium would be built without taxpayer subsidy, that effectively sealed the fate of the Rams in St. Louis.

===The Rams leave St. Louis===
The last Rams game at The Dome was on Thursday, December 17, 2015, which they won, 31–23 over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Rams formally filed their request to leave St. Louis for Los Angeles on January 4, 2016. On January 12, the NFL approved the Rams&#x27; request for relocation to Los Angeles for the 2016 NFL season.
Once the team left, Missouri taxpayers shouldered the remaining $144 million in debt and maintenance costs on the stadium until the debt was paid off in 2021. In the immediate time period after the Rams left the Dome was mainly used for concerts and events overflow from America&#x27;s Center, including the September 18, 2018, St. Louis stop for Taylor Swift&#x27;s Reputation Stadium Tour. The Dome still suffers from several design flaws that make it less and less desirable as a convention center. More recently, the Regional Sports Authority has called for additional upgrades to the Dome, to remain competitive for attracting events. Upgrades in lighting, sound, video boards, and various amenities could cost as much as $300 million. Upgrades like this would continue to bring big concerts and conventions to St. Louis, and potentially allow the city to bid for large sporting events like the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Final Four and college football bowl games. The renewal of the Illinois–Missouri football rivalry in 2026 could also potentially be held at the Dome. Similar upgrades were made to the Alamodome in San Antonio, which after $50 million in upgrades hosted the 2018 Final Four.

===Football returns with the BattleHawks===

On November 27, 2018, sources confirmed plans by the new XFL to place one of their 8 teams in St. Louis, whose five home games would be played in the Dome during the league&#x27;s inaugural season in 2020. This marked the first time professional football had been played in St. Louis since the loss of the Rams. Officials at the Dome also confirmed they had previously been in talks with the former Alliance of American Football, but had to turn down hosting a team due to scheduling conflicts in spring of 2019 (the AAF ended up shutting down before its season was completed). A busy season for the Dome, including hosting a Boat Show, a Monster Jam event, a Garth Brooks concert, and an AMA Supercross Championship event, meant that the Dome did not have five open weekends to host football games. This left an opening for the XFL to fill, which began play in spring 2020.

On December 5, 2018, at a press conference at MetLife Stadium, Oliver Luck, the then-CEO and Commissioner of the XFL, announced that St. Louis had been awarded a team. The Dome is one of two XFL venues with a roof. Along with the Alamodome, Camping World Stadium, Cashman Field and Lumen Field, it is one of five XFL venues in a downtown city center.

On December 10, 2018, news outlets released the agreement between the league and the St. Louis Convention and Visitors Commission. The XFL pay a $300,000 deposit and $100,000 for every game played in the Dome. The XFL receives 100% of ticket revenue, and the CVC receives 100% of concessions and catering revenue. This contract was signed for three seasons.

The first XFL game at the Dome was held on Sunday, February 23, 2020, when the BattleHawks defeated the New York Guardians by a score of 29–9. Opening Day attendance was the highest in the XFL at 29,554.

At the time, XFL games did not use any seats at the Terrace Level of the Dome, bringing the capacity for games down to about 30,000. Given the high ticket sales, the team considered using the Terrace Level, but with the season truncated by the COVID-19 pandemic, those plans didn&#x27;t come to fruition in 2020.

For the team&#x27;s home opener the 2023 season, an estimated 35,000 tickets sold for the team&#x27;s March 11 home opener and both the terrace level and the upper decks of the dome were opened to accommodate the high demand. The game drew an XFL record 38,310 attendance, eclipsing the previous record St. Louis set in 2020 and record of 38,253 set by the San Francisco Demons of the original XFL in 2001.

==Naming rights==
During its planning and construction, the Dome was known as The Dome at America&#x27;s Center. Trans World Airlines, a St. Louis-based air carrier, purchased naming rights in 1995 and held them until 2001, when TWA was acquired by American Airlines (American already had its name on two NBA/NHL venues in Dallas and Miami). During this time, the Dome was known as the Trans World Dome.

The facility then briefly reverted to the Dome at America&#x27;s Center until the naming rights were acquired on January 25, 2002, by Edward Jones Investments, a financial services firm based in St. Louis.

As part of a deal to sell the naming rights to Rams Park (dubbed at the time the Russell Athletic Training Center), the Rams&#x27; training facility in Earth City, Missouri, to sportswear manufacturer Russell Athletic, the Rams agreed to rename the Edward Jones Dome to Russell Athletic Field for the Rams&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Chicago Bears on December 11, 2006. The renaming was for the one night only.

After the St. Louis Rams relocated to Los Angeles in 2016, Edward Jones exercised its right to terminate its sponsorship, and the facility was once again known as The Dome at America&#x27;s Center.

==Notable events==

===NFL playoff football===
The Dome hosted five NFL playoff games, including the 1999 and 2001 NFC Championship Games, both of which the Rams won. The city&#x27;s previous NFL franchise, the St. Louis Cardinals, never hosted a playoff game in their history with the city (1960–1987); all of the playoff games they played were on the road.

===UFL playoff football===
The Dome hosted the 2024 XFL Conference Championship game between the St. Louis Battlehawks and the San Antonio Brahmas. The Brahmas defeated the Battlehawks 25–15 to advance to the 2024 UFL Championship Game. Attendance for the game was 30,237.

===2024 UFL Championship Game===

 On March 14, 2024, the UFL announced that The Dome at America’s Center would host the 2024 UFL Championship Game. UFL President and CEO Russ Brandon stated &quot;Selecting the championship game location is more than just the stadium, but the community and the fanbase that surrounds it. This is why we are proud to bring our Championship to St. Louis – a city that has loved and embraced spring football from the start.” St. Louis Mayor Tishaura O. Jones released a statement saying &quot;St. Louisans are excited to welcome the UFL championship game and tens of thousands of enthusiastic fans to our city, Soon, UFL fans from across the country will learn: Kaw is the law.&quot; The Birmingham Stallions defeated the San Antonio Brahmas 25–0 in front of 27,396 fans. 

===Concerts===
===Professional soccer===
The Dome hosted a soccer friendly match on October 13, 2007, when the United States women&#x27;s national soccer team (USWNT) played Mexico women&#x27;s national football team. The United States won 5–1. Attendance for the match was 10,861.

The Dome hosted a soccer match on August 10, 2013, when Real Madrid and Internazionale played a friendly game in front of 54,184 fans, a record attendance for a soccer match in St. Louis.

===College basketball===

In April 2005, the Edward Jones Dome hosted the 2005 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament Final Four. Louisville, Illinois, Michigan State and North Carolina met, with North Carolina winning the title game against Illinois.

The Dome has hosted an NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Regional four times. In 2004, the St. Louis Regional saw Georgia Tech defeat Kansas in a final that required overtime. Tech had previously defeated Nevada while KU became the first team (and the only one to date) to score 100 points in a college basketball game in the building in its regional semifinal win over UAB. The Dome also hosted the 2007 Midwest Regional, where Florida, en route to winning its second consecutive national championship, defeated Butler and then Oregon, who had defeated UNLV in the other regional semifinal. In 2010, Michigan State eliminated Northern Iowa, and Tennessee knocked off Ohio State, before MSU beat UT to move on to the Final Four. In 2012, North Carolina beat Ohio University and Kansas defeated NC State University. In the regional final, KU defeated UNC to advance to the Final Four.

===College football===
 The Edward Jones Dome hosted the first Big 12 Championship Game in 1996. The third game, in 1998, was also held in the Dome. The Dome has also been a neutral site for regular-season college football match ups between the Illinois Fighting Illini and the Missouri Tigers, promoted locally as the &quot;Arch Rivalry&quot;. Missouri has won all six games (2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010). On October 3, 2022, the University of Missouri announced a return of Mizzou football to St. Louis. Mizzou undefeated at (3-0) played the Memphis Tigers who were also undefeated at (3-0) on September 23, 2023 in front of a crowd of 45,085. Mizzou won the game with a final score of Missouri 34, Memphis 27. The Tigers had last played in St. Louis in 2010, a 23–13 win over Illinois, the final game of the Arch Rivalry Series, which ran from 2002 to 2010. Mizzou went 6–0 in that series. The game is part of a new partnership with the St. Louis Sports Commission which will host multiple Mizzou athletic events in the St. Louis area during the 2023–24 season – the Mizzou To The Lou Series.

===MSHSAA Show-Me Bowl===
The Dome held the annual Missouri State High School Activities Association football championship games from 1996 to 2015. The Show-Me Bowl had previously been contested at Faurot Field in Columbia, Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Robert W. Plaster Stadium in Springfield and Busch Memorial Stadium. MSHSAA had chosen to move to the Dome mostly because it was an indoor facility, as the football championships occurred in December. With the Rams&#x27; departure and anticipated end of football at the facility, the MSHSAA voted to return to rotating hosts, with Springfield getting the 2016 championship and Columbia in 2017. As of 2022 all games are played at Faurot Field in Columbia, Missouri.

===Legends of the Dome game===
On Saturday, July 23, 2016, the Isaac Bruce Foundation hosted a charity flag football game to raise money for the Isaac Bruce Foundation and relive great memories from the Rams&#x27; time in St. Louis. Many members of the Greatest Show on Turf including Kurt Warner, Dick Vermeil, Mike Martz, Torry Holt, Ricky Proehl, Az Hakim, Marc Bulger, Orlando Pace, Aeneas Williams, and many others were among the players and coaches involved. At halftime, 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame and longtime Rams All-Pro left tackle Orlando Pace was honored. Retired Navy Petty Officer Generald Wilson performed the National Anthem.

<doc id="452736" wikidata="Q6889559" url="?curid=452736" title="Modoc Point">
<text>Modoc Point is a cliff on the east shore of Upper Klamath Lake, in Klamath County, Oregon, United States, approximately 15 miles north of Klamath Falls on U.S. Route 97. It is part of the larger cliff known as Modoc Rim or Modoc Ridge.

The point is named for the Modoc tribe of Native Americans because it was assigned to them when they moved on to the Klamath Reservation, following a treaty in 1864. This area was then part of the reservation. Captain Jack and his band lived in this area from December 31, 1869, to April 26, 1870. Due to continued harassment by the Klamath, the Modoc left the reservation to return to their traditional territory to the south on the Lost River in present-day California. This was before the Modoc War (1872–1873).

Klamath folklore frequently features this location; they called it &quot;Kiuti&quot; or &quot;Muyant&quot;. It was also called &quot;Nilakla&quot;, meaning &quot;dawn&quot; or &quot;sunrise&quot;. William G. Steel stated that the point was known as &quot;Nilakla&quot;, the Klamath word for &quot;dawn&quot; or &quot;sunrise&quot;.

Modoc Point was the namesake for a railroad station and post office just north of the point.

<doc id="452738" wikidata="Q895727" url="?curid=452738" title="Kreis Meseritz">
<text>Kreis Meseritz (&quot;Landkreis Meseritz&quot; from 1939; ) was a district in Prussia, first in the southern administrative Region of Posen within the Grand Duchy of Posen (till 1848), then the Province of Posen (till 1920), then within the Province of Posen-West Prussia (till 1938) and at last as part of the administrative Region of Frankfurt within the Province of Brandenburg (till 1945). Its former territory presently lies in the eastern part of the Lubusz Voivodeship, a region of Poland, roughly resembling the extent of the present Międzyrzecz County.

== History ==
When the area later forming the territory of the Kreis Meseritz was first annexed to Prussia from 1793 to 1807 it formed the &quot;Meseritzer Kreis&quot; (Meseritz district) within the Province of South Prussia, then governed by the &quot;Departement der Kriegs- und Domänen-Kammer zu Posen&quot; (Department of the chamber of war and domains at Posen).

After being part of the Duchy of Warsaw, the area returned to Prussia as a result of the Congress of Vienna. The Kreis Meseritz came into existence on 1 January 1818 after separation from Kreis Birnbaum. In 1837 it measured 21.78 Prussian square miles (). It consisted mostly of the rural territories around the town of Meseritz. It became part of the North German Confederation in 1867 and of the German Empire when it was founded in 1871.

After World War I, the administration had to be reorganized because the Region of Posen was split. Thus the eastern part of the district was handed over to Poland in 1920, according to the Versailles treaty. In 1920, the remaining district, measuring , joined the newly founded Regierungsbezirk Schneidemühl, which became part of the Province of the Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia, established in 1922. Together with Kreis Bomst and Kreis Schwerin the Kreis Meseritz formed a western territorial exclave of Posen-West Prussia. When that province was dissolved in 1938, the bulk of its territory, anyway neighboring Pomerania, was merged into that province, whereas its western exclave including Meseritz became part of Brandenburg. In 1945, the &quot;Landkreis Meseritz&quot; was occupied by the Red Army and was integrated into Poland.

== Demographics ==
The district had a German majority population, with a significant Polish minority. After 1920, with the loss of the eastern part of the district to Poland, the remainder of the district in Germany had a Polish minority of 5.8% (including bilinguals), according to the 1925 census.
==Civil registry offices ==
In 1905, these civil registry offices () served the following towns in &quot;Kreis Meseritz&quot;:

* Altvorwerk
* Bauchwitz
* Bentschen
* Betsche
* Brätz
* Friedenhorst
* Kurzig
* Kranz
* Lowin
* Meseritz

<doc id="452740" wikidata="Q2426211" url="?curid=452740" title="Brave Fencer Musashi">
<text>is an action role-playing video game developed and published by Square in 1998 for the PlayStation home console. The game involves real-time sword-based combat in a 3D environment; it also features segments of voiced over dialogue and role-playing game elements such as a day-night cycle and resting to restore energy.

The story follows Musashi, a young swordsman who is summoned to a parallel world to defend the Allucaneet Kingdom from the Thirstquencher Empire. He searches for the Five Scrolls, which can enhance the powers of his sword, while interacting with people from Allucaneet and a nearby village.

Development began in early 1997, and was directed by Yoichi Yoshimoto, produced by Yusuke Hirata, and scored by Tsuyoshi Sekito. The game was a departure from Square&#x27;s previous role-playing video games, which brought the team several difficulties during development. The game received a positive critical response; reviewers praised the graphics in comparison to other similar games of the time, and found the gameplay, especially the action elements, very compelling. &quot;Musashi&quot; received a sequel in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 under the name of &quot;&quot;.

==Plot==
A young boy known as Musashi, reincarnated from the legendary Brave Fencer Musashi who saved the Allucaneet Kingdom from a monster called the Wizard of Darkness 150 years before, is summoned to Allucaneet by its ruler Princess Fillet to save it from the invading Thirstquencher Empire. Musashi is given the blade Fusion, and is charged with the task of obtaining Brave Fencer Musashi&#x27;s sword Lumina, the Sword of Luminescence before the Thirstquencher Army does. Although Musashi has no intention of saving the kingdom, he agrees to do so in order to return to his homeland. After Musashi recovers Lumina, he finds that most of the people from the Allucaneet kingdom, including Fillet, have been kidnapped by the Thirstquencher Empire. In order to rescue all the residents from Allucaneet and defeat the Empire, Musashi starts searching for the Five Scrolls; each one holding an elemental power able to greatly augment the sword Lumina&#x27;s powers.

With help from treasure hunter Jon, Musashi finds the Earth Scroll and defeats its crest guardian. After its defeat, half-vampire and half-zombie creatures known as Vambees appear in the nearby village. While searching for a way to stop the Vambees, Musashi finds the Water Scroll and defeats its crest guardian in the basement where the Vambees originate. While Musashi searches for the Fire Scroll, Musashi&#x27;s rival, Kojiro, kidnaps Princess Fillet and uses her as a hostage to force a battle with Musashi. Once Kojiro is defeated, and Fillet is then rescued. Musashi then searches for thieves from the Thirstquencher Empire and makes his way to the next crest guardian. It is then revealed that Princess Fillet is actually one of Thirstquencher&#x27;s thieves disguised, and that the real Fillet is still in their hands. Musashi then continues his journey, finds the Wind Scroll, and defeats its crest guardian in an ants&#x27; nest.

After finding the fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher&#x27;s base, a floating ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher&#x27;s leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina in exchange for the Princess, and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi&#x27;s sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard&#x27;s seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi&#x27;s quest merely aided The Dark Wizard&#x27;s revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard. After returning the Princess to Allucaneet Kingdom, Musashi takes Lumina to the place where he found it.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Musashi&quot; is an action role-playing game in which the player fights against enemies with a sword. The player controls the title character, Musashi, who fights a variety of enemies using his swords Fusion and Lumina and searches for five scrolls which will increase Lumina&#x27;s strength and grant him new abilities. There are also several minigames and puzzles scattered throughout which must be completed to advance the plot. The two swords he uses have varied abilities and uses. Fusion, which resembles a katana, is used to chain rapid combo hits together and can also be used to absorb Bincho energy, which is a type of magical point system that controls how many spells a player can cast and how quickly, or absorb an enemies&#x27; skill. The other sword is Lumina, a large, double-edged weapon which cannot be effectively used in combos by itself; instead, it can be imbued with elemental properties from Scrolls. Lumina is primarily offensive but in combination with the five elemental scrolls, it gains new skills. The two swords can be used in conjunction with certain techniques which are granted by various rescued townsfolk.

The game features an in-game clock and day-night system that affects the townsfolk and some of the creatures in the field (namely, the Minku - creatures from whom Musashi can obtain berries to increase his overall health stat), as well as forcing the player to pay attention to Musashi&#x27;s fatigue rating that goes up over time with lack of sleep, which, if it becomes too low, it will have a harmful effect on Musashi&#x27;s combat ability, and eventually, he will be forced to snooze on the spot, rendering him helpless until he recovers.

The player can either go to an inn to recover Musashi&#x27;s health or make Musashi sleep outdoors without a full recovery and with danger he may be attacked by enemies. To pass time, the player may also opt to collect the various action figureswhich resemble more detailed models of nearly all the characters and monstersavailable at the town toy store, which stocks new items at the start of every chapter. Along the way, Musashi obtains parts from the Legendary Armor which allow him to perform actions such as climbing or performing double jumps.

==Development==
Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi stated that the idea for the game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot; was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game was conceptualized as action-oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer, but was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game&#x27;s fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto focused on the game&#x27;s fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square&#x27;s previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.
The character, Kojiro, was based on the Japanese swordsman, Kojiro Sasaki. Both Musashi and Kojiro shared a lengthy account of rivalry, hence the same frictional relationship that was referenced between the two inside the game. The legend says the two swordsmen set up to duel each other. Musashi reportedly arrived several hours late to purposely anger Kojiro and his supporters. Another nod to Kojiro and the legendary duel is when Musashi found him and Princess Fillet on the shores of the Island of Dragons. This loosely referenced Ganryu Island, the appointed location were the long-time rivals held their famous duel.

When developing the characters for the game, Sakaguchi did not have a positive opinion of how popular the game would become. However, after the staff designed the graphics and the gameplay, he was surprised by the work, commenting that it was more interesting. The characters were designed by Koji Matsuoka and illustrated by Tetsuya Nomura. When the game was localized for an English release, translators had to change alcohol-based names with soda-pop names due to problems with rating boards. This resulted in several jokes being lost in translation. The game&#x27;s English title was changed from &quot;&quot;Brave Fencer Musashiden&quot; to &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot;&quot; in order to avoid confusing non-Japanese players about the title character&#x27;s name, as &quot;Musashiden&quot; means &quot;Musashi&#x27;s story&quot;.

The game&#x27;s musical score was composed and produced by Tsuyoshi Sekito, who had never previously worked with Square. The &quot;Brave Fencer Musashiden: Original Soundtrack&quot; was released by DigiCube in Japan on July 23, 1998; it consists of 78 tracks spanning two compact discs in a boxset.

After the game was done, the team was merged with those behind &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot;, &quot;Mana&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; to make &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;.

==Release and legacy==
&quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot; was originally released in Japan on July 16, 1998. It was re-released on June 29, 2000 as part of Square&#x27;s Millennium Collection along with merchandise including postcards, a combination camera and cellphone strap, a handy strap, and keychain fobs. Another Japanese re-release was for the PlayStation Network on July 9, 2008. In the North American market, it was packaged on November 12, 1998 with the PlayStation 1998 Collector&#x27;s CD Vol. 2, which contained a demo of &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;.

A simplified Japan-exclusive mobile phone adaptation retitled &quot;Musashi: Mobile Samurai&quot; was released in 2005. After the release of the game, plans were made for a sequel, but were then delayed for years. A PlayStation 2 sequel, titled &quot;&quot;, was developed by Square Enix and was released worldwide in 2005. Square Enix released a montage video celebrating the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary since its release on July 16, 2018.

== Reception ==
The game sold approximately 648,803 units in Japan during 1998, making it the 17th best-selling game of the year in that region. The game was given 32 out of 40 by &quot;Famitsu&quot;.

The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer James Mielke praised the graphics of the Japanese import, calling them &quot;very well done&quot; and superior to other Square RPGs of the time. &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot;″s reviews by Randy Nelson and Robinson Hood, respectively, similarly praised the game&#x27;s &quot;excellent visual design&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; reviews also praised the voice acting quality, while Nelson noted the &quot;stellar soundtrack&quot; but found the voice acting to be annoying.

The gameplay was also positively received; for example, Robinson Hood shared his opinion that the game did well with management of the game&#x27;s time. Nelson and Robinson Hood both emphasized their enjoyment of the game&#x27;s action elements. Mielke, while feeling that the action elements were the primary focus of the game, still liked the wide variety of role-playing elements present. Nelson, however, wished that the role-playing elements had been reduced even further in favor of the action parts of the game. All three reviewers compared the game to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, such as Mielke who had discussed the game to release as a direct competitor to that series. Both &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; felt that the comparison was invalid, as &quot;Musashi&quot; focused much more on action than role-playing, resulting in a game that was not a direct competitor at all.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; said, &quot;At the heart of &quot;Brave Fencer&quot; is an engaging and challenging (if somewhat simple) journey with some very clever features and an endearing cast.&quot; &quot;Edge&quot; gave the Japanese import eight out of ten, saying, &quot;With Square yet to release a truly bad game on the PlayStation, &quot;Brave Fencer Musashiden&quot; is yet another example of the ways in which the company is pushing the boundaries of its core RPG market without risking an expensive and reputation-damaging experiment. Gamers can only benefit.&quot;

<text>Kreis Neutomischel () was a district in the southern administrative region of Posen, in the Prussian province of Posen from 1887 to 1919. It presently lies in the western part of Polish region of Greater Poland Voivodeship. The district was formed in 1887, when Kreis Buk was bifurcated.

== Demographics ==
The district had a German majority in 1890. However, due to the emigration of Germans to western regions of Germany and the higher growth rate among the Polish population, Poles formed the majority by 1900. According to the Prussian census of 1910, Kreis Neutomischel had a population of 34,292, of which 54% were Poles and 46% were Germans.

After the Greater Poland uprising of 1918-1919, the district was ceded to Poland and many Germans left the area.

<text>Kreis Rawitsch () was a district in Regierungsbezirk Posen, in the Prussian province of Posen, which existed from 1887 to 1920, with its capital at Rawitsch. Today, the territory of this district lies in the southern part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship in Poland.

== History ==
On October 1, 1887, the district of Kröben was bifurcated to form the new districts of Rawitsch and Gostyn. The town of Rawitsch became the capital of the Rawitsch district.

On February 16, 1919, an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting, and on June 28, 1919, the German government officially ceded the Rawitsch district to the newly founded Poland with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. On November 25, 1919, Germany and Poland concluded an agreement on the evacuation and surrender of the areas to be ceded, which was ratified on January 10, 1920. The evacuation of the remaining area under German control including the district town of Rawitsch and the handover to Poland took place between January 17 and February 4, 1920.

== Demographics ==
According to the Prussian census of 1910, Kreis Rawitsch had a population of 50,523, of which 42% were Germans and 58% were Poles. A large part of the German population left the district after 1919, when it became part of Poland.

<text>Kreis Schrimm () was a district in the southern administrative region of Posen, in the Prussian province of Posen. The district capital was Schrimm. Its territory presently lies in the southern part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship in Poland.

== History ==
After the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 and until 1807, the area around the town of Schrimm belonged to the &quot;Schrimm district&quot; in the Prussian province of South Prussia. According to the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, the area was ceded to the Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna, on 15 May 1815, it was restored to the Kingdom of Prussia and became part of Regierungsbezirk Posen in the Grand Duchy of Posen (from 1848, the Province of Posen).

In the course of the Prussian administrative reforms, a district reform was carried out in the Posen administrative region on 1 January 1818, in which the borders of the Schrimm district were changed. The area around the town of Moschin was transferred to the Schrimm district from the Kosten district and the area around the town of Jaratsechwo was transferred to the Schrimm district from the Krotoschin district. Finally, the area around Kostschin and Santomischel was transferred from the Schrimm district to the Schroda district.

As part of the Province of Posen, the district became part of the newly founded German Empire on 18 January 1871. On 1 October 1887 the district lost parts of its territory to the two newly formed neighboring districts of Jarotschin and Gostyn.

On 27 December 1918 the Greater Poland uprising began in the province of Posen, and in January 1919, the district was under Polish control. On 16 February 1919 an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting, and on 28 June 1919, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the German government officially ceded the Schrimm district to the newly founded Second Polish Republic.

== Demographics ==
According to the census of 1861, the Schrimm district had a population of 54,036, of which 14,234 (26.3%) were Germans and 39,802 (73.7%) were Poles.

<text>Underworld is a 2003 action horror film directed by Len Wiseman in his feature film directorial debut, from a screenplay by Danny McBride, based on a story by Kevin Grevioux, Wiseman, and McBride. The film stars Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, Michael Sheen, Shane Brolly, Erwin Leder, and Bill Nighy. The plot centers on the secret history of vampires and lycans (an abbreviated form of &quot;lycanthrope&quot;, which means werewolf). The main plot revolves around Selene (Beckinsale), a vampire Death Dealer hunting Lycans. She finds herself attracted to a human, Michael Corvin (Speedman), who is being targeted by the Lycans. After Michael is bitten by a Lycan, Selene must decide whether to do her duty and kill him or go against her clan and save him.

&quot;Underworld&quot; premiered at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California on September 15, 2003, and was released in the United States on September 19, by Sony Pictures Releasing. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, but a smaller number of reviewers praised elements such as the film&#x27;s Gothic visuals, Kate Beckinsale&#x27;s performance, and the extensively worked-out vampire–werewolf mythology that serves as the film&#x27;s backstory. A surprise hit, the film grossed over $95 million worldwide against a production budget of $22 million and originated a franchise.

The film was followed by &quot;&quot; in 2006.

==Plot==
For generations, vampires and Lycans, an ancient species of werewolf, have secretly waged war. The vampires gain the upper hand when Lycan leader Lucian seemingly dies at the hands of vampire Kraven, who becomes the second-in-command to the vampires&#x27; leading elders. Selene, a member of an elite group of vampire assassins known as &quot;Death Dealers&quot;, continues to pursue the extermination of the Lycans despite other vampires no longer perceiving them as a threat.

After a clash with the Lycans, Selene discovers that they are after Michael Corvin, a seemingly ordinary medical student. Disregarding Kraven’s insistence to ignore the situation, Selene privately investigates Michael. The pair is pursued by a group of Lycans led by Lucian, who manages to bite Michael during their escape. Since Kraven was the only witness to Lucian&#x27;s supposed death, Selene begins to suspect that he lied about the death and may be working with the Lycans.

Selene prematurely awakens Viktor, a hibernating elder vampire and leaves to hide Michael in a safe house. Selene binds Michael, anticipating the Lycans&#x27; bite will transform him into a werewolf when the full moon rises. As the two of them bond, she gradually tells him more about her past, revealing that Viktor adopted her and turned her into a vampire after her family&#x27;s death at the hands of Lycans, leading her to start a vengeful campaign against them, and that Michael&#x27;s hallucinations are memories that Lucian passed down to him.

Selene returns to her coven&#x27;s mansion. Furious about being woken early, Viktor refuses to believe Selene&#x27;s warnings about Kraven&#x27;s treachery and reminds her that his fellow elder Marcus was supposed to be awakened before him. Meanwhile, en route to the mansion to awaken Marcus, vampire elder Amelia, the coven&#x27;s current ruler, is ambushed and killed by Lycans, who have tracked her with Kraven&#x27;s assistance.

Selene escapes the mansion and abducts the Lycan scientist Singe, while the Lycans capture Michael. While held captive in the Lycans&#x27; lair, Michael soon learns that Lucian was once in love with Viktor&#x27;s daughter Sonja. After he discovered their forbidden affair, Viktor murdered her. Lucian claims that Lycans were once slaves of vampires, and the war began when they rose up against them and fought for their freedom.

At the vampires&#x27; mansion, a captive Singe reveals that Selene was being honest about Kraven&#x27;s betrayal, and he reveals why the Lycans want Michael: vampires and Lycans actually have a common ancestor, which Michael is a direct descendant of. As an heir to the legendary &quot;Corvinus&quot; bloodline, he carries a unique genetic strain that could allow him to become a vampire-werewolf hybrid, which Singe predicts will lack the weaknesses of both species. An angered Viktor then kills Singe and mobilizes the Death Dealers to raid the Lycan’s lair to kill the remaining Lycans, including Michael.

In the ensuing showdown between vampires and Lycans, Selene breaks into the Lycans&#x27; lair to rescue Michael. Kraven and Lucian turn on each other, and the former tells Selene that Viktor was the one who really murdered her family and only spared and mentored her due to being reminded of his daughter. Selene is forced to bite a fatally injured Michael, hoping to make him a vampire-werewolf hybrid, while Kraven shoots Lucian, killing him.

When Viktor arrives at the Lycans&#x27; lair after the battle, he admits to murdering Selene&#x27;s parents and killing his daughter. He also insists that he killed Sonja for the good of his people and reveals she was pregnant with Lucian&#x27;s child, an abomination in the eyes of the two species. Lastly, he claims that he made Selene immortal because he loved her and proceeds to fight the hybrid Michael. Initially overwhelmed by Michael’s strength, Viktor eventually gets the upper hand and attempts to strangle him. Selene rouses from her disorientation and kills Viktor by beheading him with his sword. Now enemies of both vampires and Lycans, Selene and Michael flee the Lycans&#x27; lair together.

Back at the vampires&#x27; mansion, Marcus, now the sole surviving vampire elder, awakens after Singe&#x27;s blood seeps into his sarcophagus.

==Production==
===Development===
In 2000, Danny McBride met Len Wiseman through Nick Reed, who was the agent for both of them with intent for them to work together on a script the former wrote. While the plans for that film fizzled out, they did set out a plan to work together. Kevin Grevioux had graduated from Howard University with a degree in microbiology, but he developed a desire to study film in cinematography and screenwriting. He dropped out of graduate studies and moved to Los Angeles, where he became an actor. He came up with the original concept for the film and wrote the original screenplay, which was inspired by &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; alongside his college studies, which based vampirism and lycanthropy on a viral mutagen rather than mythology. McBride and Wiseman soon stepped in to work on the script, which they soon set out to make a trilogy of films. Each received credit for their work on the film, and Grevioux also appeared in the film as an actor.

===Legal controversy===
The film was the subject of a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by White Wolf, Inc. and Nancy A. Collins, claiming the setting was too similar to the &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; games, both set in the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; setting, and to the &quot;Sonja Blue&quot; vampire novels. White Wolf filed 17 counts of copyright infringement, and claimed over 80 points of unique similarity between White Wolf&#x27;s gaming systems and the film. These included some general plot points like vampires having superhuman speed or being able to disappear, and more specific similarities like a vampire/werewolf hybrid being referred to as an “Abomination”. White Wolf, Inc. also said the script was very similar to a story entitled &quot;The Love of Monsters&quot; (1994), which they published, written by Nancy A. Collins. In September 2003, a judge granted White Wolf an expedited hearing. The lawsuit ended in a confidential settlement.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was produced by Danny Lohner and distributed via Roadrunner Records.
Lohner (born 1970), a bass guitarist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has recorded with Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, contributed several songs to the soundtrack under the pseudonym Renholdër. Lohner included a song by Skinny Puppy, a Canadian industrial band; a song by The Dillinger Escape Plan, a US band which performs an aggressive, technical style of hardcore punk called mathcore; a song by US alternative rock/post-hardcore band Finch entitled &quot;Worms of the Earth&quot;; a song by The Icarus Line, a band known for its abrasive form of rock music; and Lisa Germano, an American singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who specializes in alternative rock and dream pop.

Music critic Bill Aicher noted that the &quot;soundtrack follow[s] in a similar gothic vein&quot; to the visuals, and stated that it &quot;does an excellent job setting the dark mood&quot; by using &quot;a veritable who&#x27;s who in the genre&quot;, with an &quot;impressive array of metal, hard rock, industrial, and otherwise gothic-themed tracks&quot;. Aicher noted that since &quot;a majority of the selections [are] written, produced, or featuring Lohner, the album retains a sense of cohesion throughout, making it much more a complete product than has generally been the case with similarly-themed products.&quot; In particular, Aicher praised the rearrangement of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot; (previously released in its original form on his studio album &quot;Reality&quot; earlier that month) as the soundtrack&#x27;s strongest piece. This version of the song, which features Maynard James Keenan (from Tool and A Perfect Circle) and guitarist John Frusciante (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers), was praised by Aicher as &quot;Dark, brooding, sad, and twitchy&quot;.

==Release==
===Box office===
It opened at first place and earned $21 million during the opening weekend of September 19-21, 2003. The film grossed $51,970,690 in the US and $95,708,457 worldwide.

===Reception===
&quot;Underworld&quot; has a 31% overall approval rating on film-critics&#x27; aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes based on 162 reviews, with an average rating of 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Though stylish to look at, &quot;Underworld&quot; is tedious and derivative.&quot; Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert said, &quot;This is a movie so paltry in its characters and shallow in its story that the war seems to exist primarily to provide graphic visuals&quot; However, some critics were more favorable: the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised it as being &quot;stylish and cruel, and mightily entertaining for certain covens out there&quot;.

&quot;Salon&quot; reviewer Andrew O&#x27;Hehir gave a mixed review, stating, &quot;by any reasonable standard, this dark vampire epic — all massive overacting, cologne-commercial design and sexy cat suits — sucks,&quot; but that &quot;at least it gives a crap&quot;, conceding that despite the movie&#x27;s flaws, the complex vampire-werewolf mythology backstory &quot;has been meticulously worked out&quot;.

===Accolades===
===Home media===
&quot;Underworld&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on January 6, 2004 by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.

<doc id="452769" wikidata="Q451714" url="?curid=452769" title="Kreis Schwerin an der Warthe">
<text>Kreis Schwerin an der Warthe () was a district in Prussia, first in the southern administrative Region of Posen within the Prussian Province of Posen (until 1920), then within the Province of the Frontier March of Posen-West Prussia (until 1 October 1938) and at last as part of the administrative Region of Frankfurt within the Province of Brandenburg (until 1945). It presently lies in the western part of Polish region of Lubusz Voivodeship.

==History==
The district was formed in 1887 from parts of the Kreis Birnbaum. After the First World War, Kreis Schwerin and few more districts belonged to the truncated remnant of the Province of Posen remaining with the Free State of Prussia, Germany. Together with Kreis Bomst and Kreis Meseritz, the Kreis Schwerin formed a western territorial exclave of Posen-West Prussia. The district capital of Schwerin an der Warthe (now Skwierzyna), was distinguished from Schwerin in Mecklenburg by the name of the Warthe river, upon which it is located. When the Posen-West Prussia province was dissolved in 1938 the bulk of its territory, anyway neighbouring Pomerania, was annexed to that province, whereas its western exclave became part of the Province of Brandenburg.

== Demographics ==
The district had a German majority with a significant Polish minority.

<doc id="452771" wikidata="Q338467" url="?curid=452771" title="Kreis Bromberg">
<text>The Bromberg district was a Prussian district that existed from 1772 to 1807 and then from 1815 to 1920. It initially belonged to the Netze District and from 1815 it was part of Regierungsbezirk Bromberg in the Grand Duchy of Posen and from 1848, the Prussian Province of Posen. The city of Bromberg (now Bydgoszcz, Poland) was detached from the district and formed its own urban district since 1875. Today, the territory of the district is part of the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland.

== History ==
Since the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the Bromberg district was one of the four districts of the Prussian Netze District. During the Napoleonic Wars, the Bromberg district was ceded by Prussia to the Duchy of Warsaw through the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807.

The entire Netze District was restored to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna on 15 May 1815. Its southeastern part with the Bromberg district was assigned to Regierungsbezirk Bromberg in the Grand Duchy of Posen which became the Province of Posen in 1848. As part of a first district reform on 1 July 1816, the Bromberg district ceded the city of Exin to the Wirsitz district. In a second district reform on 1 January 1818, the Bromberg district was significantly reduced in size. The towns of Mrotschen, Nakel and their surroundings were transferred to the Wirsitz district, and the towns of Bartschin, Labischin, Rynarschewo and Schubin, together with their surroundings formed the new district of Schubin. Another part of the Bromberg district became part of the district of Inowrazlaw. Since then, the district of Bromberg included Bromberg, Fordon, Polnisch Krone and Schulitz. The district office was set up in Bromberg.

As part of the Province of Posen, the district of Bromberg became part of the newly founded German Empire on 18 January 1871. On 29 May 1875 the city of Bromberg was detached from the Bromberg district and formed its own urban district &quot;(Stadtkreis Bromberg).&quot; The remainder of the district came to be known as &quot;Landkreis Bromberg.&quot;

On 27 December 1918 the Greater Poland uprising began in the province of Posen, but the district of Bromberg remained under German control. On 16 February 1919 an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting, and on 28 June 1919 the German government had to cede the district of Bromberg and the predominantly German-populated city of Bromberg to Poland as part of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. On 25 November 1919 Germany and Poland concluded an agreement on the evacuation of state facilities and the transfer of the areas to be ceded, which was ratified on 10 January 1920. The state facilities were evacuated and handed over to Poland between 17 January and 4 February 1920. The city of Bromberg, known in Polish as Bydgoszcz was handed over to Poland on 19 January 1920.

=== Interwar Period ===
The district of Bromberg continued in Poland as Powiat Bydgoski (Bydgoszcz County). In 1920, 16 small villages were transferred from the Powiat to the city of Bydgoszcz. On 1 April 1938 the Bydgoszcz county moved from the Poznań Voivodeship to the Pomeranian Voivodeship. In 1921, Bydgoszcz county had 140,263 inhabitants, of which 14% were Germans and 86% were Poles. The city of Bydgoszcz itself had 87,643 inhabitants, of which 27% were Germans and 73% were Poles. In 1931, only 10% of the city&#x27;s population were Germans.
=== Bromberg district in Occupied Poland (1939-1945) ===
After the German Invasion of Poland in 1939, the area of the Bromberg district was annexed by Nazi Germany into Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and the Bromberg district was re-established. At the beginning of World War II, there were clashes between the German minority and Polish armed forces in the area, and several hundred people were killed on Bloody Sunday. After the invasion of the Wehrmacht, members of the German minority formed paramilitary units, called the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, led by the SS and Gestapo, and committed mass murder of the Polish population. According to Polish sources, around 5,000 Poles were killed at Fordon, and a total of 37,000 Polish residents of the city of Bydgoszcz lost their lives by the end of the war.

In 1941, the district of Bromberg had 54,949 inhabitants, the city of Bromberg itself had 144,252 inhabitants. On 1 January 1945 the district comprised three cities and 114 municipalities. At the end of World War II, numerous German residents fled west. In January 1945 the district was occupied by the Red Army and was restored to Poland.

== Demographics ==
According to the Prussian census of 1849, the district of Bromberg (which then also included the city of Bromberg) had a population of 56,972, of whom 25,374 (44.5%) were Germans and 31,598 (55.5%) were Poles or Polish-German bilinguals. In 1910 the city of Bromberg (Stadtkreis Bromberg) was over 80% German, while Landkreis Bromberg had a German majority of around 61%. With the transfer of the district to Poland in 1920, most of the German population emigrated, due to which the district and the city had a Polish majority by 1921.

<text>Kreis Czarnikau was one of many Kreise (counties) in Regierungsbezirk Bromberg, in the Prussian Province of Posen. It existed from 1816 to 1920 and had its capital at Czarnikau. Today, the area of this district belongs to Poland and is part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

==History==
The district area became part of Prussia after the First Partition of Poland in 1772. The &quot;district of Czarnikau was&quot; formed on 1 July 1816. On 1 January 1818 the new district of Chodziesen (later renamed Kolmar in Posen) was formed from the eastern part of the Czarnikau district. On 1 October 1887 the new Filehne district was formed from the western part of the Czarnikau district.

By the Treaty of Versailles, the district was divided on 10 January 1920. The area south of the Netze river became part of Poland. The area north of the Netze remained in Germany and became part of the Netzekreis in the new province of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia.

== Demographics ==

The Czarnikau district had a German majority population and a large Polish minority.
== Table of Standesämter ==
&quot;Standesamt&quot; is the German name of the local civil registration offices which were established in October 1874 soon after the German Empire was formed. Births, marriages and deaths were recorded. Previously, only the church records were used for Christians.

<doc id="452779" wikidata="Q2101750" url="?curid=452779" title="Brilliant Light Power">
<text>Brilliant Light Power, Inc. (BLP), formerly BlackLight Power, Inc. of Cranbury, New Jersey, is a company founded by Randell L. Mills, who claims to have discovered a new energy source from what he says is the electron in a hydrogen atom dropping below its ground energy state into a &quot;hydrino state&quot;. The claims lack corroborating scientific evidence and the proposed hydrino states are unphysical and incompatible with key equations of quantum mechanics. BLP has announced several times that it was about to deliver commercial products based on Mill&#x27;s theories but has never delivered any working product.

Mills has self-published a closely related book, &quot;The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Physics&quot; and has co-authored numerous articles on hydrino-related phenomena. Critical analyses have been published in the peer reviewed journals &quot;Physics Letters A&quot;, &quot;New Journal of Physics&quot;, &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot;, and &quot;Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics&quot;. In 2009, &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot; magazine characterized it as a &quot;loser&quot; technology because &quot;most experts don&#x27;t believe such lower states exist, and they say the experiments don&#x27;t present convincing evidence&quot; and mentioned that physicist Wolfgang Ketterle had said the claims are &quot;nonsense&quot;.

== Company ==
The company, originally called HydroCatalysis Inc., was founded in 1991 by Randell Mills who claimed to have discovered a power source that &quot;represents a boundless form of new primary energy&quot; and that will &quot;replace all forms of fuel in the world&quot;. On April 25, 1991 at a press conference in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Mills first announced his hydrino state hypothesis which rejects the idea that &quot;cold fusion&quot; was occurring in studies surrounding the Fleischmann–Pons experiment. According to Mills all the effects (which themselves were disputed to be unreproducible) were caused by shrinkage of hydrogen atoms as they fell to a state below the ground state. Arguments offered by Mills were in contradiction to known chemistry and were dismissed by the scientific community.

By December 1999, BLP raised more than $25 million from about 150 investors. By January 2006, BLP funding exceeded $60 million.

Among the investors are PacifiCorp, Conectiv, retired executives from Morgan Stanley and several BLP board members like Shelby Brewer who was the top nuclear official for the Reagan Administration and Chief Executive Officer of ABB-Combustion Engineering Nuclear Power and former board member Michael H. Jordan (1936 – 2010), who was Chief Executive Officer of PepsiCo Worldwide Foods, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, CBS Corporation and Electronic Data Systems.

In 2008, Mills said that his cell stacks could provide power for long-range electric vehicles, and that this electricity would cost less than 2 cents per kilowatt-hour.

In December 2013, BLP was one of 54 applicants to receive ~$1.1M in grant funding from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.

=== Collaborators with the company ===

In 1996, NASA released a report describing experiments using a BLP electrolytic cell. Although not recreating the large heat gains reported for the cell by BLP, unexplained power gains ranging from 1.06 to 1.68 of the input power were reported, which, whilst &quot;...admit[ing] the existence of an unusual source of heat with the cell...falls far short of being compelling&quot;. The authors went on to propose the recombination of hydrogen and oxygen as a possible explanation of the anomalous results.

Around 2002, the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) granted a Phase I grant to Anthony Marchese, a mechanical engineer at Rowan University, to study a possible rocket propulsion that would use hydrinos.

In 2002, Rowan University&#x27;s Anthony Marchese said that whilst &quot;agnostic about the existence of hydrinos&quot;, he was quite confident that there was no fraud involved with BLP. Although his NIAC grant was criticised by Bob Park, Marchese said &quot;for me to not continue with this study would be unethical to the scientific community. The only reason not to pursue this would be because of being afraid of being bullied.&quot;

== Criticism ==

In 1999, the Nobel prize winning physicist Philip Warren Anderson said he is &quot;sure that it&#x27;s a fraud&quot;, and in the same year another Nobel prize winning physicist, Steven Chu, called it &quot;extremely unlikely&quot;. The following year, a 2000 patent based on its hydrino-related technology was later withdrawn by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) due to contradictions with known physics laws and other concerns about the viability of the described processes, citing Park and others.

A hydrino laser patent and a hydrino energy patent have not been withdrawn by the USPTO.

An April 2000 editorial column by Robert L. Park and an outside query by an unknown person prompted Group Director Esther Kepplinger of the USPTO to review this new patent herself. Kepplinger said that her &quot;main concern was the proposition that the applicant was claiming the electron going to a lower orbital in a fashion that I knew was contrary to the known laws of physics and chemistry&quot;, and that the patent appeared to involve cold fusion and perpetual motion. Kepplinger contacted another Director, Robert Spar, who also expressed doubts on the patentability of the patent application. This caused the USPTO to withdraw from issue the patent application before it was granted and re-open it for review, and to withdraw four related applications, including one for a hydrino power plant.

In 2000, a law firm engaged by BLP sent letters to four prominent physicists asking them to stop making what it called &quot;defamatory comments&quot;. The physicists had been quoted in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, &quot;Dow Jones Newswires&quot; and other publications as dismissing BLP&#x27;s claims on the basis that they violated the laws of physics. In response, one of the physicists, Robert L. Park of the American Physical Society, said that if BLP sued, he was confident the scientific community would lend its support and that the court would side with the physicists. Park later wrote that a number of the recipients of the letter, who had &quot;responded honestly to questions from the media&quot;, had since fallen silent. Scientists, Park wrote, are easy to intimidate since they are not rich enough to risk costly legal actions.

In May 2000, BLP filed suit in the US District Court of Columbia, saying that withdrawal of the application after the company had paid the fee was contrary to law. In 2002, the District Court concluded that the USPTO was acting inside the limits of its authority in withdrawing a patent over whose validity it had doubts, and later that year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ratified this decision. Applications were rejected by the UK patent office for similar reasons. The European Patent Office (EPO) rejected a similar BLP patent application due to lack of clarity on how the process worked. Reexamination of this European patent is pending.

Robert L. Park, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Maryland and a notable skeptic, has been particularly critical of BLP since 1991. By 2000, Park remained skeptical, stating:
&quot;Unlike most schemes for free energy, the hydrino process of Randy Mills is not without ample theory. Mills has written a 1000 page tome, entitled, &quot;The Grand Unified Theory of Classical Quantum Mechanics&quot;, that takes the reader all the way from hydrinos to antigravity. Fortunately, Aaron Barth [...] has taken upon himself to look through it, checking for accuracy. Barth is a post doctoral researcher at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and holds a PhD in Astronomy, 1998, from UC Berkeley. What he found initially were mathematical blunders and unjustified assumptions. To his surprise, however, portions of the book seemed well organized. These, it now turns out, were lifted verbatim from various texts. This has been the object of a great deal of discussion from Mills&#x27; Hydrino Study Group. &quot;Mills seems not to understand what the fuss is all about.&quot; – Park

By 2008, Park continued to express his skepticism:
&quot;BlackLight Power (BLP), founded 17 years ago as HydroCatalysis, announced last week that the company had successfully tested a prototype power system that would generate 50 KW of thermal power. BLP anticipates delivery of the new power system in 12 to 18 months. The BLP process, discovered by Randy Mills, is said to coax hydrogen atoms into a &quot;state below the ground state&quot;, called the &quot;hydrino&quot;. There is no independent scientific confirmation of the hydrino, and BLP has a patent problem. So they have nothing to sell but bull shit. The company is therefore dependent on investors with deep pockets and shallow brains.&quot; – Park In 2008, Robert L. Park wrote that BLP has benefited from wealthy investors who allocate a proportion of their funds to risky ventures with a potentially huge upside, but that in the case of BLP since the science underlying the offering was &quot;just wrong&quot; investment risk was, in Park&#x27;s view, &quot;infinite&quot;.

Various scientists also voiced their opinions as far back as the 1990s. Steven Chu, Nobel Laureate in Physics in 1997, said &quot;it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that this is real, and I feel sorry for the funders, the people who are backing this&quot;. In 1999, Princeton University&#x27;s physics Nobel laureate Phillip Anderson said of it, &quot;If you could fuck around with the hydrogen atom, you could fuck around with the energy process in the sun. You could fuck around with life itself.&quot; &quot;Everything we know about everything would be a bunch of nonsense. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so sure that it&#x27;s a fraud.&quot; Wolfgang Ketterle, a professor of physics at MIT, said BLP&#x27;s claims are &quot;nonsense&quot; and that &quot;there is no state of hydrogen lower than the ground state&quot;. Michio Kaku, a theoretical physicist based at City University of New York, adds that &quot;the only law that this business with Mills is proving is that a fool and his money are easily parted.&quot; and that &quot;There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute.&quot; While Peter Zimmerman was chief arms-control scientist at the State Department, he stated that his department and the Patent Office &quot;have fought back with success&quot; against &quot;pseudoscientists&quot; and he railed against, among other things, the inventors of &quot;hydrinos&quot;. In 2009, the editors of &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot; magazine characterized it as a &quot;loser&quot; technology because &quot;[m]ost experts don&#x27;t believe such lower states exist, and they say the experiments don&#x27;t present convincing evidence&quot; and mentioned that Wolfgang Ketterle had said the claims are &quot;nonsense&quot;. BLP has announced several times that it was about to deliver commercial products based on Mill&#x27;s theories but has not delivered a working product.

Mark Chu-Carroll a science blogger and professional software engineer accused Mills of engaging in a scam: &quot;Mills... is getting investors to give him money, promising that whatever they invest, they&#x27;ll get back manifold when he starts selling hydrino power generators! He promises they&#x27;ll be on market within a year or two – five at most! Then he comes up with either a demonstration, or the testimonial from his neighbor, or the self-publication of his book, or another press release talking about the newest version of his technology... It&#x27;s been going on for almost 25 years, this constant cycle of press release/demo/testimonial every couple of years... claims from 2009 claiming commercialization within 12 to 18 months; from 2005 claiming commercialization within months; and claims from 1999 claiming commercialization within a year... But he always comes up with an excuse why those deadlines needed to be missed. And he always manages to find more investors, willing to hand over millions of dollars. As long as suckers are still willing to give him money, why &quot;wouldn&#x27;t&quot; he keep on making claims?&quot;

&quot;Scientific American&quot; reported that in 2014, Mills was asked by an interested follower if he had ever isolated hydrinos and, in spite of previous claims, Mills said that he had not and that it would be &quot;a really, really huge task.&quot; The interlocutor pointed out that if hydrinos were being produced at the rate Mills claimed, there would be obvious observations. Moreover, there was no sign of progress, &quot;Every year they make up half the remaining distance to commercialization, but will they ever get there?&quot; 

In 2015, an energy analyst writing for &quot;Forbes&quot; noted that Mills had made numerous extraordinary and difficult-to-believe claims including that he had &quot;refuted quantum mechanics, can explain &quot;mysteries of the sun&quot; and has identified dark energy. His inventions can: produce power very cheaply through &quot;&#x27;shrinking&#x27; the hydrogen atom&#x27;s orbitsphere&quot; with a power density of 100 billion watts per liter. Additionally, the materials created can act as an explosive or propellant, make ships rustproof and endowed with stealth properties, produce an anti-gravity effect that will allow a vessel to elevate, and &quot;form the basis of batteries the size of a briefcase to drive your car 1000 miles at highway speeds on a single charge.&quot;&quot;

== Peer-reviewed criticisms ==

In the 2000s, several reviewed articles were published criticizing Hydrino theory for being incompatible with Quantum Mechanics.

For example, in 2005, Andreas Rathke of the European Space Agency, publishing in the &quot;New Journal of Physics&quot;, wrote that Mills&#x27; description of quantum mechanics is &quot;inconsistent and has several serious deficiencies&quot;, and that there is &quot;no theoretical support of the hydrino hypothesis&quot;. Rathke said it would be helpful if Mills&#x27; experimental results could be independently replicated, and suggested that any evidence produced should be reconsidered in the context of a conventional physical explanation. One inconsistency of Mills&#x27; CQM with quantum mechanics regards its inability to be reconciled with the probability density function in quantum mechanics. Rathke stated, &quot;However, while solutions of the Schrödinger equation with n&lt;1 indeed exist, they are not square integrable. This violates not only an axiom of quantum mechanics, but in practical terms prohibits that these solutions can in any way describe the probability density of a particle.&quot; In the same year, the &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot; published a critique by A.V. Phelps of the 2004 article, &quot;Water bath calorimetric study of excess heat generation in resonant transfer plasmas&quot; by J. Phillips, R. Mills and X. Chen. Phelps criticized both the calorimetric techniques and the underlying theory described in the Phillips/Mills/Chen article. The journal also published a response to Phelps&#x27; critique on the same day. In 2005 Šišović and others published a paper describing experimental data and analysis of Mills&#x27; claim that a resonant transfer model (RTM) explains the excessive Doppler broadening of the Hα line. Šišović concluded that: &quot;The detected large excessive broadening in pure hydrogen and in Ne–H2 mixture is in agreement with CM [Collision Model] and other experimental results&quot; and that &quot;these results can&#x27;t be explained by RTM&quot;. The collision model explanation for excessive broadening of the Hα line is based on established physics.

In 2006, a paper published in &quot;Physics Letters A&quot;, concluded that Mills&#x27; theoretical hydrino states are unphysical. For the hydrino states, the binding strength increases as the strength of the electric potential decreases, with maximum binding strength when the potential has disappeared completely. The author Norman Dombey remarked &quot;We could call these anomalous states &quot;homeopathic&quot; states because the smaller the coupling, the larger the effect.&quot; The model also assumes that the nuclear charge distribution is a point rather than having an arbitrarily small non-zero radius. It also lacks an analogous solution in the Schrödinger equation, which governs non-relativistic systems. Dombey concluded: &quot;We suggest that outside of science fiction this is sufficient reason to disregard them.&quot; From a suggestion in Dombey&#x27;s paper, further work by Antonio Di Castro has shown that states below the ground state, as described in Mills&#x27; work, are incompatible with the Schrödinger, Klein–Gordon and Dirac equations, key equations in the study of quantum systems.

In 2008, the &quot;Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics&quot; published an article by Hans-Joachim Kunze, professor emeritus at the Institute for Experimental Physics, Ruhr University Bochum, critical of the 2003 paper authored by R. Mills and P. Ray, Extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy of helium–hydrogen. The abstract of the article is: &quot;It is suggested that spectral lines, on which the fiction of fractional principal quantum numbers in the hydrogen atom is based, are nothing else but artefacts.&quot; Kunze stated that it was impossible to detect the novel lines below 30 nm reported by Mills and Ray because the equipment they used did not have the capability to detect them as per the manufacturer and as per &quot;every book on vacuum-UV spectroscopy&quot; and &quot;therefore the observed lines must be artefacts&quot;. Kunze also stated that: &quot;The enormous spectral widths of the novel lines point to artefacts, too.&quot;

<doc id="452783" wikidata="Q302634" url="?curid=452783" title="Aaron Russo">
<text>Aaron Russo (February 14, 1943 – August 24, 2007) was an American entertainment businessman, film producer, director, and political activist. He was best known for producing movies including &quot;Trading Places&quot;, &quot;Wise Guys&quot;, and &quot;The Rose&quot;. Later in life, he created various libertarian-leaning political documentaries including &quot;Mad as Hell&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

After a six-year battle with cancer, Russo died on August 24, 2007.

==Early life==
Russo was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. Growing up in Lawrence, Nassau County, New York, on Long Island, Russo worked for his family&#x27;s undergarment business. He played prep football at Lawrence High School.

==Entertainment career==
In April 1968, Russo opened the nightclub Kinetic Playground in Chicago, Illinois, originally naming it the Electric Theater. He booked numerous prominent rock groups and musicians at the club such as The Grateful Dead, Iron Butterfly, Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, King Crimson, Vanilla Fudge, Rotary Connection, and The Who.

In addition to owning his own nightclub, Russo managed several musical acts throughout the 1970s including The Manhattan Transfer and Bette Midler.

Russo then moved into producing and directing movies, six of them receiving Academy Award nominations and two receiving Golden Globe Award nominations. His first producing credit was for Midler&#x27;s &quot;Clams on the Half-Shell Revue&quot;. Other notable feature films he produced include &quot;The Rose&quot; (1979), starring Midler, and also &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd. His final film would be &quot;&quot;, a political documentary critical of the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Reserve System and warning about the coming of the New World Order.

In 1987, Aaron Russo had set up his own entertainment company, Aaron Russo Entertainment with self-financing up to $86 million in coin to aid for the prospecting for film, TV and music properties and it was a Delaware corporation that was based in New York, and gave them a capital of $62 million for production of 6-to-10 films each budgeted at $5 million, which is maximum of $15 million, and gains agreements with Vestron Inc. for US home video rights, the Rank Organization (previous position held by Producers Sales Organization, prior to bankruptcy) gave them foreign rights to all media and US syndication and pay cable rights going to HBO, so they would not have to disclose the participants&#x27; contributions to the production kitty, and all of the ARE productions were gone to Orion Pictures for the U.S. and Canada theatrical rights. He then named Irwin Russo as senior vice president of the Los Angeles-based Aaron Russo Films and the company had set up feature projects by 1988, with record division Aaron Russo Films and Aaron Russo Television set to follow.

==Political career==
Russo became involved in political issues in the mid-1990s when he produced and starred in the documentary entitled &quot;Mad As Hell&quot; in which he criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the federal government&#x27;s War on Drugs, the concept of a National Identity Card, and government regulation of alternative medicine.

In 1998, Russo took his political interests to a higher level, running for governor of the state of Nevada as a Republican. Placing second in the Republican primary with 26% of the vote to candidate Kenny Guinn, Russo later endorsed the Democratic nominee, then-Las Vegas mayor Jan Laverty Jones, who would eventually lose to Guinn. Russo was planning to run again for Nevada governor in 2002 as either an independent or Libertarian, but was sidelined by cancer.

In January 2004, Russo declared his candidacy for the President of the United States initially as an independent, but then as a Libertarian. At the Libertarian National Convention in May 2004, Russo received 258 votes to Michael Badnarik&#x27;s 256 votes and Gary Nolan&#x27;s 246 votes, short of the majority required to receive the presidential nomination. Russo would eventually lose the nomination on the convention&#x27;s third and final ballot to Badnarik by a vote of 423–344.

==Death==
On August 24, 2007, Russo died at the age of 64 of cancer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

==Filmography==
&quot;He was a producer in all films unless otherwise noted.&quot;

<doc id="452784" wikidata="Q769617" url="?curid=452784" title="Iowa Territory">
<text>The Territory of Iowa was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from July 4, 1838, until December 28, 1846, when the southeastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Iowa. The remainder of the territory would have no organized territorial government until the Minnesota Territory was organized on March 3, 1849.

==History==
Most of the area in the territory was originally part of the Louisiana Purchase and was a part of the Missouri Territory. When Missouri became a state in 1821, this area (along with the Dakotas) effectively became unorganized territory. The area was closed to white settlers until the 1830s, after the Black Hawk War ended. It was attached to the Michigan Territory on June 28, 1834. At an extra session of the Sixth Legislative Assembly of Michigan held in September, 1834, the Iowa District was divided into two counties by running a line due west from the lower end of Rock Island in the Mississippi River. The territory north of this line (which started just south of the present-day Davenport) was named Dubuque County, and all south of it was Des Moines County. When Michigan became a state in 1836 the area became the Iowa District of western Wisconsin Territory—the region west of the Mississippi River.

The original boundaries of the territory, as established in 1838, included Minnesota and parts of the Dakotas, covering about of land.

Burlington was the provisional capital; Iowa City was designated as the official territorial capital in 1841. Fort Snelling was located on the western side of the Mississippi placing it within the Territory until statehood. 

When Iowa became a state on December 28, 1846, no provision was made for official organization of the remainder of the territory. Morgan L. Martin, the Wisconsin territorial delegate to congress, pushed through a bill to organize a territory of Minnesota which would encompass this land. While the bill passed in the house, it did not pass the senate. In the following session a bill by Stephen A. Douglas was introduced in the senate but also did not pass. The situation was resolved when Minnesota Territory was organized on March 3, 1849, the day before the close of congress.

In the 1840 United States census, 18 counties in the Iowa Territory reported the following population counts:
==Governance==

<text>The Dakotas, also known as simply Dakota, is a collective term for the U.S. states of North Dakota and South Dakota. It has been used historically to describe the Dakota Territory, and is still used for the collective heritage, culture, geography, fauna, sociology, economy, and cuisine of the two states.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Dakota&quot; refers to the Dakota people.

==History==

The territory now known as the Dakotas includes a large portion of the ancestral land of Native American tribes, in particular various tribes of Sioux such as the Dakota people, also known as the Santee Sioux. The United States government stakes its claim to the land through the Louisiana Purchase and Rupert&#x27;s Land acquisition. The region historically involved a complex series of conflicts between the U.S. government and Native American tribes (and among themselves).

The region was part of the Minnesota and Nebraska territories until 1861. Dakota Territory initially included parts of present day Montana, Nebraska and Wyoming. The fall of 1861 resulted in a poor harvest and was followed by a harsh winter, leading to extreme hardship for the Dakota in the region. Desperate for food and money, they were denied loans by local traders. A series of raids in the spring of 1862 ultimately resulted in Dakota War of 1862 between the U.S. government and the Dakota people. The U.S. won the war, the aftermath which included a mass hanging of 38 people on December 26, 1862, the largest mass execution in U.S. history. The remaining Santee Dakota people were exiled by the U.S. government to the Dakota Territory.

The end of the war did not solve the conflicts between Native Americans and the Americans. Fighting would continue, for example along the Bozeman Trail, until the Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. The treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation and &quot;designated the Black Hills as &#x27;unceded Indian Territory&#x27; for the exclusive use of native peoples.&quot; The subsequent discovery of gold in the Black Hills in 1874 by George Armstrong Custer&#x27;s Black Hills Expedition, would cause a gold rush and the U.S. to violate the treaty. The Indian Appropriations Act of 1876 went into effect on August 15, 1876. This was referred to as &quot;sell or starve&quot; by the Native Americans and led to the Great Sioux War of 1876. The conflict between the Sioux and miners and the U.S. forces backing them would culminate in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as &quot;Custer&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, the most significant battle of the war. Despite being a Sioux victory, Battle of the Little Bighorn preceded the Agreement of 1877 which took away the Black Hills and forced Native Americans onto reservations (see Black Hills land claim) and left the Sioux with little means to address their grievances. 

Before he left office, President Cleveland signed a bill on February 22, 1889, splitting the Dakota Territory along the modern borders. This bill was ratified by Congress, and President Harrison signed the paper work to create the US states of North Dakota and South Dakota on November 2, 1889, deliberately signing such that it was unknown which was officially created first.

The debate over the land within the Dakotas, specifically the Black Hills, is unsettled. The Sioux in 1920 began a legal battle over their ancestral lands within the US system of justice. Sixty years later, the US Supreme Court upheld in 1980&#x27;s &quot;United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians&quot; case that tribal land was illegally taken from the Sioux and ruled they deserved financial compensation. The Sioux Nation has refused the offer because the land was &quot;never for sale&quot;.

==Overview==
The two states combined have a population of 1,670,324, slightly less than Idaho, ranking at 39th place. The Dakotas have a total area of 147,878 square miles (383,177 square kilometers), which would rank 4th among U.S. states, right before Montana. The two states also have a population density of 9.8 per sq. mi (3.8 per km2).

The Dakotas are within the Midwestern United States, with the western portion in the High Plains. The PBS miniseries &quot;New Perspectives on the West&quot; noted historically important areas within the Dakotas, including the Black Hills, the town of Deadwood, Fort Buford, Standing Rock Reservation and Wounded Knee. The Upper Missouri River and the Upper Missouri River Valley are important geological features in the area, as well.

The area is mostly inhabited by people of Northern European origin. 44.9% of the population are of German ancestry, 21.8% of Norwegian, and 9.6% are of Irish heritage.

Both of the Dakotas have humid continental climate, with warm to hot summers and cold to even subarctic temperatures in winter. Due to the difference in circle of latitude, temperatures differ by degrees between the southern and northern areas, even inside the respective states.

<text>The 2002 Veterans Day weekend tornado outbreak was an unusually severe and expansive severe weather event across portions of the Central and Eastern United States from the evening hours of November 9 into the early morning hours of Veterans Day, November 11, 2002. A series of troughs tracked eastward across the United States, providing strong wind shear, while anomalously warm and unstable air surged northward into the Ohio River Valley. As a result, multiple tornadoes occurred across Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri on November 9. A far more widespread and severe event occurred the following day, with three distinct tornado outbreaks focused across areas from Illinois to Pennsylvania; Tennessee and Kentucky; and areas from Mississippi to South Carolina. The most intense tornado of the outbreak was a violent F4 tornado that occurred near Van Wert, Ohio. A total of 76 tornadoes occurred during the 3-day period, collectively resulting in 36 deaths and 303 injuries. As of 2022, the event ranks as the third-largest tornado outbreak on record in November.

==Meteorological synopsis==
===November 9===
The first signs for organized severe weather became apparent on November 7, when the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) outlined a Slight risk across portions of the mid-Mississippi and western Ohio River valleys valid for November 9. On that day, a powerful and negatively-tilted upper-level trough upwards of was observed driving east-southeastward toward the U.S. Central and Southern Plains. While a shortwave trough at the leading edge of this feature progressed across the Texas Panhandle, a surface area of low pressure resided across the Central and Northern Plains. Southerly flow associated with the cyclone prompted the northward advection of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, with dewpoints rising into the lower 60s °F as far north as southern Illinois; this moisture promoted modest destabilization and mid-level convective available potential energy (CAPE) values from 500 to 1,000 J/kg. As the shortwave trough continued eastward, it aided in the formation of thunderstorms across northeastern Arkansas around 00:00 UTC. These storms resided in a strongly sheared environment, with storm relative helicity – a measure of the potential for cyclonic updrafts – around 800 m2/s2. Despite initial concern that the lower levels of the atmosphere were not quite as favorable, evening atmospheric soundings from Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, showcased an extremely favorable environment for significant tornadoes. Clusters of supercells tracked from Arkansas into Tennessee over ensuing hours, and in fact, the persistence of these storms resulted in the formation of a weak outflow boundary that further enhanced the tornado threat. A total of 10 tornadoes occurred throughout the evening of November 9, including multiple strong tornadoes and one that killed two people near Huntingdon, Tennessee.

===November 10–11===
On November 10, the SPC warned of the potential for a significant tornado outbreak and/or widespread damaging wind episode across northeastern Mississippi, much of Tennessee, northwestern Alabama, and much of Kentucky, where the organization issued a High risk of severe weather. Morning upper-air analyses showed mid- to upper-level winds of across the southern Rocky Mountains, as well as an embedded shortwave trough moving east toward the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys. At the surface, a strong area of low pressure was positioned over Wisconsin and moving northeastward toward Ontario. Throughout the afternoon hours, the tornado outbreak unfolded in three distinct locations. To the north across Indiana and Ohio, temperatures rose into the lower 70s and dewpoints climbed into the mid-60s °F, supporting CAPE values of 1,000–2,000 J/kg. In addition, significant pressure falls in the region contributed to backed surface winds, aiding in favorable low-level shear profiles. Although storms in this region were initially congealed into a squall line ahead of a cold front, the presence of strong shear and dry air in the mid-levels supported the line&#x27;s breakdown into supercells and bowing segments. Ahead of this activity, additional discrete supercells overspread much of Ohio owing to a prefrontal trough. A long-tracked, violent F4 tornado began in Van Wert and tracked for over , killing 4 people and injuring 17 others. An F3 tornado near Tiffin killed one person and injured two others. An F2 tornado in Clark, Pennsylvania, killed 1 person. Numerous other tornadoes were recorded throughout the afternoon. The event evolved into more of a significant damaging wind episode as storms progressed farther east into Pennsylvania by the evening hours.

With the northern outbreak unfolding, a central outbreak simultaneously overspread portions of Tennessee and Kentucky, while a southern outbreak spanned areas from Mississippi into South Carolina. Surface observations and atmospheric soundings across the High and Moderate risk areas showed a very unstable environment with surface-based CAPE values in the 2,000–3,000 J/kg range. Despite the presence of a cap, this inversion was weak and expected to be eroded by warming daytime temperatures. Meanwhile, deep-layer wind shear of overspread the area. Though shear profiles were largely unidirectional initially, low-level winds were expected to become more conducive for discrete supercells and tornadoes. As expected, temperatures climbing to around and dewpoints reaching the mid-60s °F allowed for deep convective development into the afternoon. Multiple swaths of supercells developed throughout the region, including one in middle Tennessee, a second from central Mississippi into northwestern Alabama, and a third from northeastern Louisiana into central Mississippi. Fatal tornadoes occurred near Shelbyville, Joyner, and Crossville in Tennessee; Carbon Hill, Saragossa, and Centre in Alabama; and Crawford in Mississippi. Numerous other tornadoes were documented throughout the area. Much like the outbreak farther north, the event transitioned into more of a damaging wind event by the evening hours, though a few tornadoes still occurred during the early morning hours across Georgia and South Carolina.

===Van Wert–Roselms, Ohio===
On November 10, a violent tornado struck the city of Van Wert and the community of Roselms in Ohio. The National Weather Service rated the worst of the damage F4 on the Fujita scale, with several homes and businesses sustaining F4 damage in the city of Van Wert. The tornado touched down approximately northeast of the village of Willshire, Ohio in Van Wert County and began moving northeast towards the city of Van Wert. Right after touching down, the tornado rapidly intensified to F4 intensity as it crossed Zook Road approximately southwest of Van Wert. Around Zook Road, a 75-year-old man was killed when the tornado destroyed his house at F4 intensity. The National Weather Service documented that he was attempting to shield his wheelchair-bound wife when the tornado struck. As the tornado continued into Van Wert, it maintained F4 intensity. In Van Wert, 43 homes and five businesses were destroyed and 164 homes and 27 businesses were damaged. The Twin Cinemas and the five buildings in the Vision Industrial Park sustained F4 damage. In the Twin Cinemas, 60 people, mostly children, were inside watching a movie when the tornado destroyed the building. Vehicles from the cinema parking lot were thrown into the seats of the cinema. An 18-year-old was killed after driving near the cinema and having his car thrown into the cinema seats. Three county engineering buildings were also destroyed by the tornado in Van Wert. After passing through the Vision Industrial Park, several homes and business in Van Wert sustained F3 to F4 damage.

The tornado continued northeast out of Van Wert and crossed into Paulding County, where it struck the community of Roselms. Only one building remained standing in Roselms after the tornado. Every structure in Roselms sustained up to F3 damage, and the entire track of the tornado through Paulding County was rated F3 by the National Weather Service. The Dayton Daily Newspaper reported that in Paulding County, 23 homes, 32 barns, and a church were completely leveled and 19 additional homes were damaged. The Washington Township building was also leveled by the tornado. The tornado continued northeast at F3 intensity as it crossed into Putnam County. In Putnam County, the tornado destroyed a mobile home in Continental, killing a man and his wife. After traveling through the county, the tornado rapidly weakened to F0 intensity just before it crossed into Defiance County. While traveling through Defiance County, the tornado skipped and caused F0 damage to five homes and some outbuildings before crossing into Henry County. In Henry County, the tornado continued to skip and caused F0 damage to outbuildings and trees along a path of . The tornado lifted approximately southeast of Malinta.

In total, the tornado killed four people and injured 17 others along a path of , while reaching a peak width of . The tornado caused at least $30 million (2002 USD) in damage just in the city of Van Wert.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later stated that out of the entire tornado outbreak, which included a total of 76 tornadoes, the Van Wert–Roselms tornado was the most remembered, due to &quot;the heroic efforts of [Scott Shaffer] at the Van Wert Cinemas. After hearing the tornado warning that was broadcast over the county&#x27;s warning system, the manager led 60 patrons to interior hallways and restrooms. This was only a few minutes before the tornado destroyed the theater. Besides leveling the building, 3 cars were tossed into the seats that were previously occupied by moviegoers, many of which were children.&quot;

<doc id="452794" wikidata="Q1787342" url="?curid=452794" title="Kreis Hohensalza">
<text>Kreis Hohensalza ([ˌhoːənˈzalt͡sa]) was one of many Kreise (districts) in the northern administrative region of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen from 1815 to 1919. Its capital was Hohensalza (Inowrocław).

== History ==
Kreis Hohensalza, known as Kreis Inowrazlaw until 1904, was a Kreis (district) in the northern administrative region of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen. It was located within the Bromberg Government Region, first in the Grand Duchy of Posen (1815-1848, in personal union with Prussia) and then in the Prussian Province of Posen (1848-1919). On 18 January 1871 the Kreis, along with all of Prussia, became part of Germany. Kreis Hohensalza was part of the military command (German: &quot;Bezirkskommando&quot;) at Hohensalza (Inowrocław). The main regional court (German: &quot;Landgericht&quot;) was in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), with a magistrate&#x27;s court (German: &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) in the capital city Hohensalza (Inowrocław).

On 1 July 1886 southern areas of the district were separated and became part of the new Kreis Strelno. The capital city, formerly known as Inowrazlaw, was renamed Hohensalza on 5 December 1904, and the county name also changed by default. In the course of the Greater Poland uprising in 1919, the southern part of the district came under Polish control, while the northern part with Argenau (Gniewkowo) remained under German control. Following the Treaty of Versailles in July 1919, Germany also ceded the northern part of the district to Poland between 17 January and 4 February 1920. The territory then became part of the Second Polish Republic.

During World War II, the territory of the former Kreis was annexed by Nazi Germany and &quot;Landkreis Hohensalza (Wartheland)&quot; was established, which existed from 1939 to 1945.

== Demographics ==
The district had a Polish majority population, with a significant German minority.
==Standesämter==
&quot;Standesamt&quot; is the German name of the local/municipal civil registration offices which were established in October 1874 soon after the German Empire was formed. Births, marriages and deaths were recorded. Previously, only duplicate copies of church records were used. By 1905, Kreis Hohensalza had the following 15 offices for rural residents:

Amsee district was created in 1887 from Hohensalza district. Dziennitz district was created in 1890 from Lojewo district, Ostwehr district was created from Lojewo and Luisenfelde districts, and Schöngrund district was created from Gross Morin and Luisenfelde districts. Roneck district was created in 1905 from Argenau and Gross Wodek districts. In addition, the following cities were separate districts for urban residents: Hohensalza, Argenau.

<doc id="452795" wikidata="Q1787367" url="?curid=452795" title="Kreis Kolmar in Posen">
<text>The Kreis Kolmar in Posen (1818–1877 &quot;Kreis Chodziesen&quot;) was a district in the northern government region of Bromberg, in the Prussian Province of Posen, from 1818 to 1920. The district capital was Kolmar in Posen.

==History==
The &quot;district of Chodziesen&quot; was formed in 1818. It became part of the German Empire in 1871. On March 6, 1877, the district and the district town of Chodziesen were renamed Kolmar in Posen. On 1 April 1914 the city of Schneidemühl was disentangled from the district and became an independent town (Stadtkreis) within the Bromberg Region.

On December 27, 1918, the Greater Poland uprising began in the province of Posen. Except for the south of the district around the town of Budsin, the Kolmar district remained largely under German control. On February 16, 1919, an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting. On June 28, 1919, with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, the German government officially ceded most of the district including the capital Kolmar to the newly founded Second Polish Republic.

On November 25, 1919, Germany and Poland concluded an agreement on the evacuation and surrender of the areas to be ceded, which was ratified on January 10, 1920. The area to be ceded was cleared and handed over to Poland between January 17 and February 4, 1920.

Only the rural communities of Schönfeld, Stöwen and Usch Hauland in the northern part of the Kolmar district remained in Germany after this, as did the city of Schneidemühl. These areas became part of the newly formed Prussian Province of Grenzmark Posen-West Prussia. Schönfeld became part of the Flatow district, while Stöwen and Usch Hauland became part of the newly formed Netzekreis district.

== Demographics ==
According to the census of 1849 the district had a population of 46,353 of whom 32,739 (71%) were Germans and 13,614 (29%) were Poles and others.
== Table of Standesämter ==
&quot;Standesamt&quot; is the German name of the local civil registration offices which were established in October 1874 soon after the German Empire was formed. Births, marriages and deaths were recorded. Previously, only the church records were used for Christians.

<text>Kreis Mogilno was one of many Kreise (counties) in the northern administrative region of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen, from 1815 to 1919. Its capital was Mogilno.

==History==
The territory was created as part of the Grand Duchy of Posen (1815-1848, in personal union with Prussia) and later was part of the Prussian Province of Posen (1848-1919). On 18 January 1871 Kreis Mogilno, along with all of Prussia, became part of the German Empire. The territory of Kreis Mogilno was reduced slightly in 1887 when its western extension (most of the Rogowo and Mittelwalde districts) was used to create the new Znin district.

Kreis Mogilno was part of the military command (German: &quot;Bezirkskommando&quot;) at Gnesen (Gniezno). The main court (German: &quot;Landgericht&quot;) was in Gnesen (Gniezno), with lower courts (German: &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) in Tremessen (Trzemeszno) and Mogilno.

On 27 December 1918 the Greater Poland uprising began in the province of Posen, and by 31 December 1918 the town of Mogilno was under Polish control. On 16 February 1919 an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting, and on 28 June 1919 the German government officially ceded Kreis Mogilno to the Second Polish Republic with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

During World War II, the territory of the former Kreis again became Landkreis Mogilno (Wartheland), 1939-1945 in Nazi Germany.

==Demographics==
According to the Prussian census of 1890, Kreis Mogilno had a population of 40,158, of which 74% were Poles and 26% were Germans.

== Standesämter == 
&quot;Standesamt&quot; is the German name of the local civil registration offices which were established in October 1874 soon after the German Empire was formed. Births, marriages and deaths were recorded. Previously, only duplicate copies of church records were used. By 1905, Kreis Mogilno had the following 9 offices for rural residents:

Altraden district was created in 1903 from parts of Pakosch and Mogilno districts. Kirchlich Palendzie district was called Hartfeld/Padniewo prior to 1886. In addition, the following cities were separate districts for urban residents: Gembitz, Mogilno, Tremessen.

<doc id="452798" wikidata="Q1926889" url="?curid=452798" title="Michael Badnarik">
<text>Michael James Badnarik ( ; August 1, 1954 – August 11, 2022) was an American software engineer, political figure, and radio talk show host. He was the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2004 elections, and placed fourth in the race, behind independent candidate Ralph Nader and the two major party candidates, George W. Bush and John Kerry. Two years later Badnarik ran as a Libertarian Party candidate in the 2006 congressional elections for Texas&#x27;s 10th congressional district seat near Austin. In a three candidate field, Badnarik came in third, receiving 7,603 votes for 4.3% of the vote.

==Political career==
Badnarik&#x27;s political philosophy emphasized individual liberty, personal responsibility, and strict adherence to an originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. All of his positions arise from this foundation. In economics, Badnarik supported laissez-faire capitalism, a system in which the only function of the government is the protection of individual rights from the initiation of force and fraud. He, therefore, opposed institutions such as welfare and business regulation.

Badnarik first ran for public office in 2000 as a Libertarian, earning 15,221 votes (17%)
in a race for the Texas legislature district 47. In 2002 he ran for the district 48 seat receiving 1,084 votes, or 2%.

Badnarik was a member of the libertarian Free State Project.

===2004 U.S. presidential campaign===

In February 2003, Badnarik announced his candidacy for the Libertarian Party&#x27;s presidential nomination and spent the following 18 months traveling the country, teaching a course on the United States Constitution to dozens of libertarian groups. He has written a book, &quot;Good To Be King: The Foundation of our Constitutional Freedom&quot; () on the subject of constitutional law; the book was first self-published by Badnarik, but was released in hardcover in October 2004.

Badnarik was viewed as unlikely to win the Libertarian presidential nomination, facing challenges from talk-show host Gary Nolan and Hollywood producer Aaron Russo. At the 2004 Libertarian National Convention, Badnarik gained substantial support following the candidates&#x27; debate (broadcast live on C-SPAN). In what was then the closest presidential nomination race in the Libertarian Party&#x27;s history, all three candidates polled within 12 votes of each other on the first ballot (Russo 258, Badnarik 256, Nolan 246). When the second ballot placed the candidates in the same order, Gary Nolan was eliminated and threw his support to Badnarik; Badnarik won the nomination on the third ballot 417 to 348, with None of the Above receiving six votes. Richard Campagna of Iowa City, Iowa, was elected separately by convention delegates as his vice-presidential nominee.

Some members of the party disapproved of Badnarik becoming the presidential nominee, feeling that he would be unable to draw media attention that many had felt Russo would have. Libertarian blogger Julian Sanchez called Badnarik &quot;embarrassing.&quot;

Badnarik&#x27;s capture of the nomination was widely regarded as a surprise by many within the party; both Nolan and Russo had outpaced him in both fundraising and poll results prior to the convention. Badnarik commented following his success at the national convention, &quot;If I can win the nomination, there&#x27;s no reason I can&#x27;t win this election.&quot;

Badnarik and Green Party candidate David Cobb were arrested in St. Louis, Missouri, on October 8, 2004, for an act of civil disobedience. Badnarik and Cobb were protesting their exclusion from the presidential debates of the 2004 presidential election campaign. They were arrested after crossing a police barricade in an attempt to serve an Order to Show Cause to the Commission on Presidential Debates.

Badnarik was not the only member of his family running in the 2004 cycle. His mother, Elaine Badnarik, was nominated by the Libertarian Party for lieutenant governor of Indiana in the 2004 Indiana gubernatorial election.

By the end of the election cycle, Badnarik&#x27;s presidential campaign had raised just over one million dollars (US), obtained ballot access in 48 states plus the District of Columbia (the Libertarian Party failed to obtain ballot access in Oklahoma and New Hampshire, although Badnarik was a qualified write-in candidate in New Hampshire), and placed nationwide political advertisements on CNN and Fox News, in addition to local advertising buys in the important swing states of Wisconsin, New Mexico, Nevada, and Arizona.

No national polls including Badnarik had put him above 1.5%, though one poll put him at 5% in New Mexico and another at three percent in Nevada. A Rasmussen poll on October 26, 2004, put Badnarik at 3% in Arizona.

Badnarik received 397,265 votes nationwide in the November 2, 2004, election, taking 0.3 percent of the popular vote and placing fourth, 68,385 votes behind Ralph Nader but 12,834 votes better than the party&#x27;s 2000 election results. Badnarik spent most of early 2005 touring the nation and giving speeches. He also taught a class on the U.S. Constitution, using his experiences on the campaign trail to develop his lesson plan.

===2006 U.S. congressional campaign===

In August 2005, Badnarik announced that he would run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2006 election. He ran for the 10th Congressional District of Texas, which is currently represented by Republican Michael McCaul.

He raised nearly $450,000 for his campaign and received the Libertarian Party of Texas nomination for its 10th district Congressional candidate.

He received 7,603 votes, or four percent, in the November election, losing to Republican incumbent Michael T. McCaul, who received 55 percent of the vote, and Democrat Ted Ankrum, who got 40 percent.

===Post-campaign events===
Badnarik delivered a keynote speech at the 2007 New Hampshire Liberty Forum, where he announced his endorsement for Ron Paul, U.S. Congressman from Texas 14th district, in the 2008 presidential election.

In April 2007, he began hosting a talk radio program, &quot;Lighting the Fires of Liberty&quot;, on the We the People radio network. His final program aired on October 3, 2008.

In October 2008, he began hosting a talk radio program, by the same title, on the Genesis Communications Network. His final program aired on March 20, 2009.

In November 2009, Badnarik was elected as one of three delegates from the State of Texas to attend the 2009 Continental Congress sponsored by the We The People Foundation, and subsequently elected parliamentary president of that body.

Badnarik suffered a heart attack on the morning of December 21, 2009, while in Viroqua, Wisconsin attending a hearing regarding a raw milk case. After the hearing he boarded a car to go to lunch with friends, then slumped over. His friends attempted CPR and contacted the paramedics. They attempted CPR to revive him three times with no success. Upon the fourth attempt his heart was revived yet with erratic behavior. He was taken by helicopter to Gundersen Lutheran Hospital CCU in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

On January 10, 2010, Badnarik posted a message to his friends and supporters stating that he was improving rapidly and would soon be released from the hospital.

==Issue positions==

* Abortion: While Badnarik personally opposed abortion, he stated that decisions regarding abortion rights should be made at the state and not the federal level. He recognized that there is significant controversy surrounding when life begins, and argued that therefore the state should not legislate against abortion, since a fetus is arguably not a human life in and of its own.
* Broadcast regulation: Badnarik opposed government regulation of &quot;offensive&quot; content. &quot;I find it very offensive when the government tells me what I can and cannot watch. [...] Individual people should decide what is or is not obscene and they will make that decision by watching or not watching reality TV.&quot;
* Campaign finance reform: Badnarik supported eliminating public matching funds and contribution limits for political campaigns.
* Civil rights: Badnarik supported all of the Bill of Rights unequivocally, a position which he claimed contrasts with most political candidates. Badnarik said that government does not grant rights but rather acknowledges them, that they exist independently of government as part of who and what we are, and that, as Thomas Jefferson noted in the United States Declaration of Independence, the only legitimate function of government is to secure them.
* Economic policy: Badnarik argued for elimination of the federal income tax and drastically reduce government spending. He advocated the elimination of the Federal Reserve and the restoration of a commodity-based currency.
* Education: Badnarik supported the elimination of the federal Department of Education, claiming that it is both unconstitutional and ineffective. Badnarik called for the privatization of education, which he contended would result in both more effective and affordable alternatives due to free market competition.
* Energy: Badnarik opposed government regulation of the energy industry, arguing that the free market is more effective in controlling prices and maintaining stability.
* Free trade: Badnarik supported withdrawing the U.S. from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), commenting, &quot;NAFTA and GATT have about as much to do with free trade as the Patriot Act has to do with liberty&quot;. He further contended that the U.S. needed&quot;to get the government out of regulating trade, so that American workers can do what they do best and that is to create wealth.&quot;
* Gay marriage and Civil Unions: Badnarik believes that marriage, as a contract between two individuals, should not be a government concern and supports the right of individuals to associate in whatever ways they see fit.
* Gun control: Badnarik opposed restrictions on gun ownership as restrictions on an individual&#x27;s right to self-defense. Badnarik was a self-professed gun owner who strongly supported the Right to keep and bear arms.
* Healthcare: Badnarik opposed government involvement in healthcare and drug regulation, as he maintained that the drug approval process at that time raised costs for consumers.
* Illegal drugs: Badnarik supported the decriminalization of marijuana and other illegal drugs.
* Immigration: Badnarik believed that, &quot;Peaceful immigrants should be allowed to enter the US at conveniently located Customs and Immigration stations, subject only to brief vetting to ensure that they are not terrorists or criminals, and reasonable consideration of the nation&#x27;s ability to assimilate them.&quot;
* International relations: Badnarik supported the reduction and eventual elimination of government-funded foreign aid programs. His platform additionally called for withdrawal from the United Nations and the eviction of the UN from the United States.
* Iraq War and military intervention: Badnarik supported a rapid withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq, while providing for repair to Iraqi infrastructure damaged by U.S. action. He also supported ending foreign intervention.
* Military draft: Badnarik was opposed to any reinstatement of a military draft.

===Arguments for limited government===
Badnarik believes that the federal government had exceeded its Constitutional bounds and should be scaled back in favor of a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; society. 

===Views on taxes===
Badnarik did not believe that the U.S. Constitution provided for a federal income tax, and posed the tax protester argument that the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was never legally ratified.

Badnarik also posed the tax protester argument that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as &quot;non-positive law,&quot; was only applicable to certain groups, and argues that the only types of income susceptible to taxation are &quot;the domestic income of &quot;foreigners&quot;, certain &quot;foreign&quot; income of Americans, income of certain possessions corporations, and income of international and foreign sales corporations&quot; He has also cited the Supreme Court decision &quot;Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad&quot;, in which the Court indicated that the Sixteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution did not give Congress any power that it did not have already. He also argues that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified, citing the two-volume work &quot;The Law that Never Was&quot;, co-authored by William J. Benson.

One of his key statements on income tax was that the United States grew to be the most powerful nation in the Universe without requiring such a tax, and that it began to falter when the government began to intervene in the economy and individuals&#x27; lives. In an August 2004 interview with the journal &quot;Liberty&quot;, Badnarik stated that he had not filed tax returns for approximately the previous three years as he was unemployed. He further added that he had contacted the IRS to find out his tax liability and to settle up on any taxes he owed. This was an effort to minimize difficulties for his then-campaign for the presidency.

===Positions on personal identification===
When Badnarik moved to Texas, he did not obtain a driver&#x27;s license, due to that state&#x27;s requirement that an applicant provide a Social Security Number and fingerprint. Identification is supplied by carrying a United States passport.

==2004 Ohio recount==
After the 2004 presidential election, Badnarik, working with Green Party candidate David Cobb, sought a recount of the Ohio vote. This caused controversy within the Libertarian Party, as presidential second place candidate John Kerry had not contested the vote in Ohio, and a recount would cost the state an estimated $1.5 million of tax-payer money. Some party members were concerned that a recount would damage the public perception of the Libertarian party.

Badnarik said that he decided to push for a recount after receiving &quot;about two dozen passionate requests to do so from Libertarians in various states.&quot;

==&quot;Good to Be King&quot;==
In his book &quot;Good to Be King&quot; Badnarik suggests that it is unnecessary to have a driver&#x27;s license to drive, that the IRS has no Constitutional authority to collect taxes, and that common law marriages are valid in all 50 states.

==Death==
Badnarik died from heart failure at his home in San Antonio, Texas, on August 11, 2022, aged 68. He was cremated through the Neptune Society.

<doc id="452800" wikidata="Q548642" url="?curid=452800" title="Seicho-no-Ie">
<text>is a syncretic, monotheistic, New Thought Japanese new religion that has spread since the end of World War II in Asia. It emphasizes gratitude for nature, the family, ancestors and, above all, religious faith in one universal God. Seichō no Ie is the world&#x27;s largest New Thought group. By the end of 2010 it had over 1.6 million followers and 442 facilities, mostly located in Japan.

== History ==
In 1930, Masaharu Taniguchi, working as an English translator, published the first issue of what he called his &quot;non-denominational truth movement magazine&quot;, which he named &quot;Seichō no Ie&quot; to help teach others of his beliefs. This was followed by forty volumes of his &quot;Truth of Life&quot; philosophy by 1932. Over the next forty years, he published an additional four hundred–odd books and toured many countries in Europe, South America, and North America with his wife Teruko, to lecture on his beliefs personally. Ernest Holmes, founder of Religious Science, and his brother Fenwicke were of great assistance to Taniguchi. Fenwicke traveled to Japan and co-authored several books, with one called &quot;The Science of Faith&quot; becoming a cornerstone of the denomination.

Taniguchi died in a Nagasaki hospital on June 17, 1985, at the age of ninety-one. Today the president of Seichō no Ie is (谷口雅宣).

In the 2000s, the Seicho-no-Ie Fundamental Movement seceded from the headquarters. As of 2017, there are three factions of the original movement. The two largest factions are led by Masanobu Taniguchi, the president of Seichō no Ie; a group of elder teachers of Seichō no Ie known as Manabushi leads the other faction.

==Scriptures and publications==

The four holy of Seicho-no-Ie are:

*. Taniguchi Masaharu claimed that it was divinely revealed to him by Kannon on December 1, 1930. There are eight sections: God (神), Spirit (霊), Matter (物質), Reality (実在), Wisdom (智慧), Delusion (無明), Sin (罪), and Man (人間). Similar to many Nichiren sects&#x27; views of the Lotus Sutra, this sutra is treated as a protective amulet that can be carried, read, or copied for protective benefits. In Uji, Kyoto, there is a hall for followers to copy the sutra.
* (

Other scriptures include:

The most important texts in Seicho-no-Ie are:
*, which consists of 40 volumes (main edition, 頭注版) published since 1932; this is the religion&#x27;s most important doctrinal text. There is also an abridged edition (愛蔵版) with 20 volumes.
*, which consists of 11 volumes, was initially published from 1954 to 1958. It summaries key doctrines mentioned in the &quot;Truth of Life&quot;.

Seicho-no-Ie publishes a newspaper called &quot;Seishimei&quot; &quot;聖使命, Sacred Mission&quot;). It also publishes three magazines:
*&quot;Inochi no wa&quot; (いのちの環, &quot;Circle of Life&quot;) for general readers
*&quot;Shirohato&quot; (白鳩, &quot;White Dove&quot;) for women
*&quot;Hidokei 24&quot; (日時計24, &quot;Sundial 24&quot;) for young readers

<doc id="452809" wikidata="Q864465" url="?curid=452809" title="MAC-10">
<text>The Military Armament Corporation Model 10, officially abbreviated as &quot;M10&quot; or &quot;M-10&quot;, and more commonly known as the MAC-10, is a compact, blowback operated machine pistol/submachine gun that was developed by Gordon Ingram in 1964. It is chambered in either .45 ACP or 9mm. A two-stage suppressor by Sionics was designed for the MAC-10, which not only abates the noise created but makes it easier to control on full automatic (although it also makes the gun far less compact and concealable).

Military Armament Corporation never used the &quot;MAC-10&quot; nomenclature in its catalogues or sales literature, but &quot;MAC-10&quot; is frequently used by Title II dealers, gun writers, and collectors. For a decade, the semi-automatic pistol version of the weapon was forbidden in the U.S. under the assault weapons ban enacted by Congress in 1994.

==Design==
The MAC-10 is built predominantly from steel stampings. A notched cocking handle protrudes from the top of the receiver, and turning the handle 90°, locks the bolt, and acts as an indicator the weapon is unable to fire. The MAC-10 has a telescoping bolt, which wraps around the rear face of the barrel. This allows a more compact weapon and balances the weight of the weapon over the pistol grip, where the magazine is located. The MAC-10 fires from an open bolt, and the light weight of the bolt results in a rapid rate of fire. In addition, this design incorporates a built-in feed ramp as part of the trigger guard (a new concept at the time) and, to save on cost, the magazine design was recycled from the M3 Grease Gun. The barrel is threaded to accept a suppressor, which works by reducing the discharge&#x27;s sound without attempting to reduce the speed of the bullet. The .45 ACP models are well-suited for this, as most .45 loads are naturally subsonic, as opposed to the specialized subsonic loads usually required for suppressed 9mm weapons. At the suggestion of the United States Army, the suppressor also acts as a foregrip to inhibit muzzle rise when fired. Ingram added a small bracket with a small strap beneath the muzzle to aid in controlling recoil during fully automatic fire. The original rate of fire for the MAC-10 in .45 ACP is approximately 1090 rounds per minute. That of the 9mm is approximately 1250, and that of the smaller MAC-11 in .380 ACP is 1500 rounds per minute.

Noting the weapon&#x27;s poor accuracy, in the 1970s, International Association of Police Chiefs weapons researcher David Steele described the MAC series as &quot;fit only for combat in a phone booth&quot;.

===Suppressor===
The primary reason for the original M10 finding recognition was its revolutionary sound suppressor designed by Mitchell WerBell III of Sionics. This suppressor has a two-stage design, with the first stage being larger than the second. This uniquely shaped suppressor gives the MAC-10 a very distinctive look. It is also very quiet, to the point that the bolt can be heard cycling, along with the suppressed report of the weapon&#x27;s discharge, though only if subsonic rounds are used (standard .45 ACP rounds are subsonic). The suppressor, when used with a Nomex cover, creates a place to hold the firearm with the secondary hand, making it easier to control. During the 1970s, the United States placed restrictions on the export of suppressors, and a number of countries canceled their orders as the effectiveness of the MAC-10&#x27;s suppressor was one of its main selling points. This was one factor that led to the bankruptcy of Military Armament Corporation, another being the company&#x27;s failure to recognize the private market. The original Sionics suppressor is 11.44inches in length, 2.13inches in overall diameter, and weighs 1.20 pounds.

===Calibers and variants===
While the original M10 was available chambered for either .45 ACP or 9mm, the M10 is part of a series of machine pistols, the others being the MAC-11/M-11A1, which is a scaled-down version of the M10 chambered in .380 ACP (9×17mm); and the M-11/9, which is a modified version of the M-11 with a longer receiver chambered in 9×19mm, later made by SWD (Sylvia and Wayne Daniel), Leinad and Vulcan Armament. Law enforcement bureaucracies such as the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) consider MAC-11 variants such as the Leinad PM-11 to be part of the &quot;MAC-10 class pistol&quot;.

In the United States, machine guns are National Firearms Act items. As the Military Armament Corporation was in bankruptcy, a large number of incomplete sheet metal frame flats were given serial numbers and then bought by a new company, RPB Industries. Some of the previously completed guns, which were already stamped with MAC, were then stamped with RPB on the reverse side, making it a &quot;double stamp&quot; gun.

RPB Industries made many open-bolt semi-automatic and sub-machine guns before the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) seized roughly 200 open-bolt semi-autos during the drug wars of 1981. The BATFE insisted that all future semi-automatic firearms were to be manufactured with a closed-bolt design as the open-bolt semi-automatics were considered too easy to illegally convert to full automatic operation.

Wayne Daniel, a former RPB machine operator, purchased much of their remaining inventory and formed SWD, designing a new weapon which was more balanced, available either fully or semi-automatic with his new BATFE-approved closed bolt design.

There are several carbine versions of the M-11/9 and Cobray and SWD manufactured a smaller version chambered in .380 ACP as a semiautomatic pistol called the M-12.

Today, while the civilian manufacture, sale and possession of post-1986 select-fire MAC-10 and variants is prohibited, it is still legal to sell templates, tooling and manuals to complete such conversions. These items are typically marketed as being &quot;post-sample&quot; materials for use by Federal Firearm Licensees for manufacturing/distributing select-fire variants of the MAC-10 to law enforcement, military and overseas customers.

==1994 assault weapons ban in the U.S.==
The semi-automatic civilian pistol version of the MAC-10, which operates differently from its military counterpart, fell under the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. The ban – which expired in 2004 – enacted various requirements that defined an assault weapon. The MAC-10 was named directly in the ban, and it failed three of the requirements: 
#A semi-automatic version of an automatic firearm,
#A manufactured weight of 50 ounces (1.4kg) or more when the pistol is unloaded. The MAC-10 weighs 100.16 oz (2.84kg), and
#A threaded barrel to attach barrel extender, flash suppressor, handgrip, or suppressor

Additionally, the magazine capacity is 32 rounds. In response, Wayne Daniel redesigned the M-11 by eliminating the threaded barrel and creating a new magazine release that would only allow the firearm to accept a new 10-round magazine, as the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban mandated. The new firearm was called the PM11/9.

==Foreign copies and derivatives==

===BXP===
The BXP is a 9mm submachine gun developed in the mid-1980s by the South African company Mechem (currently a division of Denel, formerly under ARMSCOR) and brought into production in 1984. Due to international arms embargoes of Apartheid South Africa, the country was forced to design and manufacture their own weapons. The weapon was intended for use by security forces. The manufacturing rights have changed hands several times, passing from Mechem to Milkor Marketing and later to Truvelo Armoury, the current manufacturer ().

===Cobra carbine===
The Cobra carbine is a semi-automatic firearm of Rhodesian origin manufactured during the Rhodesian Bush War Era as a self-defense weapon for farmers and is chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum round. The layout of this weapon is somewhat based on the Uzi submachine gun.

===Patria submachine gun===
The &quot;Pistola Ametralladora Patria&quot; is a close copy of the MAC-10 and features a cooling jacket/barrel extension much like the South African BXP. It was developed by Major Luis Ricardo Dávila, of the Argentine Air Force, and protected by national Patent n° 220494/5/6/7 on 20/08/1980. It uses 9mm rounds for easy transportation and can be operated in either hand. A similar earlier Argentine weapon based on the MAC-10 was also designed in 1977 by manufacturer Domingo Matheu, the &quot;Pistola Ametralladora MPA&quot;.

===Enarm MSM===
The Enarm MSM (Mini Sub Metralhadora or Mini Submachine Gun) was a submachine gun of Brazilian origin based on the Uzi and MAC-10 weapons, made by ENARM. It was chambered in the 9×19mm Parabellum round and also came with a foregrip. Although the weapon performed well in trials, it was discontinued due to the company disbanding due to &quot;internal disruptions&quot;.

<doc id="452812" wikidata="Q675729" url="?curid=452812" title="Cheilodactylidae">
<text>Cheilodactylidae , commonly called morwongs but also known as butterfish, fingerfins, jackassfish, sea carp, snappers, and moki, is a family of marine ray-finned fish. They are found in subtropical oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. The common name &quot;morwong&quot; is also used as a name for several unrelated fish found in Australian waters, such as the painted sweetlips (&quot;Diagramma pictum&quot;). The classification of the species within the Cheilodactylidae and the related Latridae is unclear.

== Taxonomy ==
Cheilodactylidae is classified within the superfamily Cirrhitoidea, under the suborder Percoidei of the large order Perciformes. Molecular studies have also placed the superfamily within the order Centrarchiformes, although the Cirrhitoidea is confirmed as a monophyletic clade. The 5th Edition of &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; does not recognise Centrarchiformes and retains the superfamily within the order Perciformes. The family has four genera according to the 5th Edition of Fishes of the World, however the authors of that book admit that further studies need to be carried out to resolve the true relationships of all the taxa within the Cirrhitoidea.

The traditional delimitation of this family and Latridae is based on morphological differences, but the reliability of these differences has been questioned, and genetics do not support this treatment, either, leading some to suggest the majority should be in Latridae. Based on this, the only species that should remain in the family Cheilodactylidae are the relatively small &quot;Cheilodactylus fasciatus&quot; and &quot;C. pixi&quot; from southern Africa. This also means the broader definition of the genus &quot;Cheilodactylus&quot; is polyphyletic. All other &quot;Cheilodactylus&quot; species clearly do not belong with these two in &quot;Cheilodactylus&quot; and instead appear to belong in several different genera (only one of which is &quot;Goniistius&quot;), but how many and their exact delimitation is not clear at present.

==Genera==
The following genera are classified within the Cheilodactylidae:

* &quot;Cheilodactylus&quot; 
* &quot;Chirodactylus&quot; 
* &quot;Dactylophora&quot; 
* &quot;Nemadactylus&quot; 

==Characteristics==
Cheilodactylids have a continuous dorsal fin which may have the anterior spiny part almost separated from the soft rayed posterior part, the spiny part contains 14–22 spines and the soft rayed part has 19–39
rays. The anal fin has 3 spines. although the third may be small and quite be difficult to see. and 7–19 soft rays. there are no teeth on the roof of or at the sides the mouth. The lowermost 4-7 pectoral fin rays of adults are normally robust, elongated, and not attached to the main part of the pectoral fin. The largest species is &quot;Dactylophora nigricans&quot; which attains a maximum total length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
Cheilodactylids are fishes of near-shore rocky reefs to depths of about . They are found mainly in temperate waters in the southern hemisphere but some species classified in the subgenus &quot;Goniistius&quot;, of the genus &quot;Cheilodactylus&quot; &quot;sensu lato&quot; extend into the North Pacific.

==Biology==
Cheilodactylids are nocturnal foragers and are carnivorous, feeding on benthic invertebrates such as crustaceans, molluscs and echinoderms. They do not guard their eggs.

==Fisheries==
Cheilodactylids are generally regarded as important food fish and at least one species is targeted by commercial fisheries in Australia.

<doc id="452823" wikidata="Q1111241" url="?curid=452823" title="Colorado Territory">
<text>The Territory of Colorado was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from February 28, 1861, until August 1, 1876, when it was admitted to the Union as the 38th State of Colorado. 

The territory was organized in the wake of the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush of 1858–1862, which brought the first large concentration of white settlement to the region. The organic legislative act creating the slave-free Territory of Colorado was passed by the United States Congress and signed by 15th President James Buchanan (1791-1868, served 1857-1861), into law on February 28, 1861. During that period which at the same time (since beginning with South Carolina the previous December 1860), the secession of seven, later eleven southern slave states had been occurring those several months proclaiming / forming a new independent Southern government of the Confederate States of America (which eventually grew in the next year by two more divided state governments to thirteen in the Confederacy, with two alleged western territories) that precipitated the American Civil War of April 1861 to June 1865. The boundaries of the Federals&#x27; newly designated Colorado Territory were essentially identical with those of the current / modern State of Colorado, with lands taken from the four surrounding previous Federal territories of Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, and Utah (Deseret) established during the 1850s. The organization of the new territory helped solidify Union / Federal control over the mineral-rich area of the western Rocky Mountains. Statehood was regarded as fairly imminent with the expected growth in the constantly westward moving population, but the local territorial ambitions for full statehood were thwarted at the end of the war in 1865 by a constitutional veto by newly sworn in 17th President Andrew Johnson (1808-1875, served 1865-1869), who was a War Democrat who succeeded to the office after briefly only serving one month as Vice President after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination that April. Statehood for the territory was a recurring issue during the subsequent Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration, with Republican 18th President Grant advocating statehood against a less willing Congress during the following post-war Reconstruction era (1865-1877). After a long constant lobbying campaign, the old Colorado Territory finally ceased to exist after only 15 years when the State of Colorado was admitted to the Union as the 38th state during the American Centennial celebrationn in August 1876

East and West of the Continental Divide, which split the North American continent and the Rocky Mountains, plus the new territory which included the western portion of the previous Kansas Territory, as well as some of the southwestern decade-old Nebraska Territory, and a small parcel of the northeastern corner of the New Mexico Territory. On the western side of the Divide, the territory included much of the eastern older Utah Territory, all of which besides its substantial while Mormon / L.D.S. population especially around the capital of Salt Lake City, was strongly controlled by the Ute and Shoshoni native tribes The Eastern Plains were held much more loosely by the intermixed Cheyenne and Arapaho, as well as by the Pawnee, Comanche and Kiowa. In 1861, ten days before the establishment of the Federal territory, the Arapaho and Cheyenne agreed with the United States government in the East in Washington, D.C. to give up most their areas of the Great Plains to white settlement but were allowed to live in their larger traditional areas, so long as they could tolerate homesteaders near their camps. By the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the Native American presence had been largely reduced or pacified through military action or peace treaties on the High Plains.

==History==

The land that eventually became the Colorado Territory fell under the jurisdiction of the United States in three separate stages: the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 (as adjusted by the 1819 Adams–Onis Treaty), then the Annexation of Texas in 1845, and finally the Mexican Cession in 1848. The land claims of Texas were initially controversial. The border between the U.S. and Mexico was redrawn in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo at the end of the Mexican–American War, and the final borders of the state of Texas were established by the Congressional Compromise of 1850.

===Indigenous populations===
The land that was eventually defined as the Colorado Territory was home to a number of indigenous civilizations. The Ute lived across both Western Colorado and the eastern high plains. The Anasazi lived in the southwestern, southern, and parts of southeastern Colorado. The Comanche and Jicarilla Apache lived in the area that would become the southeastern portions of the Territory. The Arapaho and Cheyenne also had a presence in the eastern and northeastern plains of the area at times.

===Exploration by non-native peoples===
The earliest explorers of European extraction to visit the area were Spanish explorers such as Coronado, although the Coronado expedition of 1540–42 only skirted the future border of the Colorado Territory to the south and southeast. In 1776, Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante explored southern Colorado in the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition.

Other notable explorations included the Pike Expedition of 1806–07 by Zebulon Pike, the journey along the north bank of the Platte River in 1820 by Stephen H. Long to what came to be called Longs Peak, the John C. Frémont expedition in 1845–46, and the Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 by John Wesley Powell.

===Early settlements, trade, and gold mining===
In 1779, Governor de Anza of New Mexico fought and defeated the Comanches under Cuerno Verde on the Eastern Slope of Colorado, probably south of Pueblo. In 1786, de Anza made peace with the Comanches, creating an alliance against the Apaches.

A group of Cherokee crossed the South Platte and Cache la Poudre River valleys on their way to California in 1848 during the California Gold Rush. They reported finding trace amounts of gold in the South Platte and its tributaries as they passed along the mountains. In the south, in the San Luis Valley, early Mexican families established themselves in large land grants (later contested by the U.S.) from the Mexican government.

In the early 19th century, the upper South Platte River valley had been infiltrated by fur traders, but had not been the site of permanent settlement. The first movement of permanent U.S. settlers in the area began with the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which allowed private land claims to be filed. Among the first settlers to establish claims were former fur traders who returned to the lands they once trapped, including Antoine Janis and other trappers from Fort Laramie, who established a town near Laporte along the Cache la Poudre in 1858. See Forts in Colorado.

In 1858, Green Russell and a party of Georgians, having heard the story of the gold in the South Platte from Cherokee after they returned from California, set out to mine the area they described. That summer they founded a mining camp Auraria (named for a gold mining camp in Georgia) at the confluence of the South Platte and Cherry Creek. The Georgians left for their home state the following winter. At Bent&#x27;s Fort along the Arkansas River, Russell told William Larimer, Jr., a Kansas land speculator, about the placer gold they had found. Larimer, realizing the opportunity to capitalize on it, hurried to Auraria. In November 1858, he laid claim to an area across Cherry Creek from Auraria and named it &quot;Denver City&quot; in honor of James W. Denver, the previous governor of the Kansas Territory. Larimer did not intend to mine gold himself; he wanted to promote the new town and sell real estate to eager miners.

Larimer&#x27;s plan to promote his new town worked almost immediately, and by spring 1859 the western Kansas Territory along the South Platte was swarming with miners digging in river bottoms in what became known as the Colorado Gold Rush. Early arrivals moved upstream into the mountains quickly, seeking the lode source of the placer gold, and founded mining camps at Black Hawk and Central City. A rival group of civic individuals, including William A.H. Loveland, established the town of Golden City at the base of the mountains west of Denver City, with the intention of supplying the increasing tide of miners with necessary goods.

===Territorial aspirations===
The movement to create a territory within the present boundaries of Colorado followed nearly immediately. Citizens of Denver City and Golden City pushed for territorial status of the newly settled region within a year of the founding of the towns. The movement was promoted by William Byers, publisher of the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, and by Larimer, who aspired to be the first territorial governor. In 1859, settlers established the Territory of Jefferson, and held elections, but the United States Congress did not recognize the territory, and it never gained legal status.

Congressional grant of territorial status for the region was delayed by the slavery issue, and a deadlock between Democrats, who controlled the Senate, and the antislavery Republicans, who gained control of the House of Representatives in 1859. The deadlock was broken only by the Civil War. In early 1861, enough Democratic senators from seceding states resigned from the U.S. Senate to give control of both houses to the Republicans, clearing the way for admission of new territories. Three new territories were created in as many days: Colorado (February 28), Nevada (March 1), and Dakota (March 2).

Colorado Territory was officially organized by Act of Congress on February 28, 1861 (), out of lands previously part of the Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and New Mexico territories. Technically the territory was open to slavery under the Dred Scott Decision of 1857, but the question was rendered moot by the impending American Civil War and the majority pro-Union sentiment in the territory. The name &quot;Colorado&quot; was chosen for the territory. It had been previously suggested in 1850 by Senator Henry S. Foote as a name for a state to have been created out of present-day California south of 35° 45&#x27;.

===Civil War years===
During the Civil War, the tide of new miners into the territory slowed to a trickle, and many left for the East to fight. The Missourians who stayed formed two volunteer regiments, as well as home guard. Although seemingly stationed at the periphery of the war theaters, the Colorado regiments found themselves in a crucial position in 1862 after the Confederate invasion of the New Mexico Territory by General Henry Sibley and a force of Texans. Sibley&#x27;s New Mexico campaign was intended as a prelude to an invasion of the Colorado Territory northward to Fort Laramie, cutting the supply lines between California and the rest of the Union. The Coloradans, under the command of Union Army General Edward Canby and Colonel John P. Slough, Lt. Col. Samuel F. Tappan and Major John M. Chivington, defeated Sibley&#x27;s force at the two day Battle of Glorieta Pass along the Santa Fe Trail, thwarting the Confederate strategy.

===Colorado War between the U.S. and the Indians of Cheyenne and Arapaho===

In 1851, by the Treaty of Fort Laramie, the United States acknowledged the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes control, in the Colorado area, of the Eastern Plains between North Platte River and Arkansas River eastward from the Rocky Mountains. The Fort Laramie Treaty, in Article 2 of the treaty, did allow the U.S., government to build roads, military and other posts on Indian lands. If these roads could be used by U.S. citizens to lawfully pass through the Indian territories was not stated but apparently implied since the U.S. government bound itself to protect Indian nations against depredations by U.S. citizens. The treaty did not grant any rights for the erection of posts or settlements by U.S. civilians. Since this treaty was enacted before the railroads had come and before the finding of gold in the region, few whites had ventured to settle in what is now Colorado. By the 1860s, as a result of the Colorado Gold Rush and homesteaders encroaching westward into Indian terrain, relations between U.S. and the Native American people deteriorated. On February 18, 1861, in the Treaty of Fort Wise, several chiefs of Cheyenne and Arapaho supposedly agreed with U.S. representatives to cede most of the lands, ten years earlier designated to their tribes, for white settlement, keeping only a fragment of the original reserve, located between Arkansas River and Sand Creek. This new fragment was assigned in severalty to the individual members of the respective tribes with each member receiving of land. The United States, by the Fort Wise Treaty, wished to have the Indians settle the new reservation as farmers. The U.S. agreed to pay the tribes a combined total of $30,000 per year for 15 years and in addition to provide a lumber mill, one or more mechanic shops, dwelling houses for an interpreter, and a miller engineer. See Article 5 of the Fort Wise Treaty.

A good part of their co-nationals repudiated the treaty, declared the chiefs not empowered to sign, or bribed to sign, ignored the agreement, and became even more belligerent over the &#x27;whites&#x27; encroaching on their hunting grounds. Tensions mounted when Colorado territorial governor John Evans in 1862 created a home guard of regiments of Colorado Volunteers returning from the Civil War and took a hard line against Indians accused of theft. On August 21, 1864, a band of 30 Indians attacked four members of the Colorado Cavalry as they were rounding up stray cattle. Three of the members made it back to the stockade at Franktown, Colorado, but the fourth man failed to return. This man, Conrad Moschel, was found a few days later having been shot with a firearm and pierced with an arrow, and had been scalped in the manner of the Cheyenne. This offensive action by the warring Cheyenne further enraged the U.S. people of Colorado. After several minor incidents in what would later come to be designated as the Colorado War, in November 1864, a force of 800 troops of the Colorado home guard, after heavy drinking, attacked an encampment of Cheyenne and Arapaho at Sand Creek, murdering between 150 and 200 Indians, mostly elderly men, women and children. This Sand Creek Massacre or &#x27;Massacre of Cheyenne Indians&#x27; led to official hearings by the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War in March and April 1865. After the hearings, the Congress Joint Committee in their report on May 4, 1865, described the actions of Colonel John Chivington and his Volunteers as &quot;foul, dastardly, brutal, cowardly&quot; and:

Nevertheless, justice was never served on those responsible for the massacre; and nonetheless, the continuation of this Colorado War led to expulsion of the last Arapaho, Cheyenne, Kiowa and Comanche from the Colorado Territory into Oklahoma.

===The movement for statehood===
Following the end of the American Civil War, a movement was made for statehood; the United States Congress passed the Admission Act for the territory in late 1865, but it was vetoed by President Andrew Johnson. For the next eleven years, the movement for territorial admission was stalled, with several close calls. President Grant advocated statehood for the territory in 1870, but Congress did not act.

In the meantime, the territory found itself threatened by lack of railroads. By the late 1860s, many in Denver had sold their businesses and moved northward to the Dakota Territory communities of Laramie and Cheyenne, which had sprung up along the transcontinental railroad. Faced with the possible dwindling of the town and its eclipse by the new towns to the north, Denverites pooled their capital and built the Denver Pacific Railroad northward to Cheyenne to bring the rail network to Denver. The Kansas Pacific Railway was completed to Denver two months later. The move cemented the role of Denver as the future regional metropolis. The territory was finally admitted to the Union in 1876.

==Territorial capitals==
Three Colorado cities served as the capital of the Territory of Colorado:
#Denver City: from creation on February 28, 1861, until July 7, 1862.
#Colorado City: July 7 until August 14, 1862.
#Golden City: August 14, 1862 until December 9, 1867.
#Denver: December 9, 1867 until statehood on August 1, 1876.

===Governmental buildings===
For much if not all of its existence, the Colorado Territorial government did not actually own its houses of government, instead renting available buildings for governmental purposes. Today, two buildings which served the Territorial government remain: the historic log building in Colorado City, and the Loveland Block in downtown Golden City (which had housed the complete legislature, Territorial Library and possibly Supreme Court from 1866 to 1867, with library remaining to 1868). Others which served include the original Loveland Building (1859–1933, 1107 Washington Avenue in Golden, housing the Territorial House from 1862 to 1866); the Overland Hotel (1859–1910, 1117 Washington Avenue in Golden, housing the Territorial Council from 1862 to 1866); and the Territorial Executive Building (unknown dates, approximately 14th and Arapahoe Streets in Golden, housing the executive branch of the government from 1866 to 1867).

<text>The Dos Equis Pavilion (originally Coca-Cola Starplex Amphitheatre) is an outdoor amphitheatre located in Fair Park, Dallas, Texas.

==Naming history==
The venue opened as Coca-Cola Starplex Amphitheatre on July 23, 1988, with a concert by Rod Stewart. The outdoor covered amphitheater featured 7,500 seats under a pavilion and 12,500 general admission lawn seats. After Coca-Cola&#x27;s naming rights expired in 1998, the venue was known simply as Starplex Amphitheatre.

In 2000, naming rights were sold to the Smirnoff vodka company, as a result of a corporate sponsorship agreement with House of Blues. The center was then called Smirnoff Music Centre and The Music Centre at Fair Park (for concerts featuring underage performers).

The name changed again in January 2008 to Superpages.com Center when naming rights were awarded to Superpages.com.

The name has changed several times since then: to Gexa Energy Pavilion in 2011, Starplex Pavilion in 2017. and Dos Equis Pavilion in April 2018.

== Performers ==
Coca-Cola Starplex Amphitheatre opened the weekend of July 23–24, 1988 with Rod Stewart on Friday night, followed the next evening with a double bill of Aerosmith and Guns N&#x27; Roses. Bob Dylan, Hall &amp; Oates, AC/DC, Steve Winwood, Kenny Loggins, Huey Lewis, Def Leppard, Willie Nelson and Bruce Hornsby all played the Starplex just in the first month. Before the season ended in October, Starplex hosted shows from Tangerine Dream, James Taylor, Eric Clapton, The Moody Blues, Chicago, Elton John, Robert Plant, and Santana. The fall Starplex concert schedule coincided with the State Fair of Texas, also held in Fair Park each October.

Rod Stewart returned on April 21, 1989 to kick off the second concert season at Starplex. The bookings at Starplex were eclectic and played heavily to classic-rock and nostalgia acts. Tom Petty, Jimmy Buffett, Bon Jovi, Jackson Browne, Chris Isaak, Allman Brothers Band, The Beach Boys, Peter, Paul and Mary, The Monkees, Little Feat, Don Henley, Jefferson Airplane, Stevie Nicks, and Cher all played Starplex that summer and fall. Chicago, Elton John, and Bob Dylan each returned. The promoters also experimented with jazz offerings like Spyro Gyra and Miles Davis, and booked popular pop acts like Tiffany, New Kids On The Block, Milli Vanilli, and Paula Abdul.

Frank Sinatra opened the 1990 season at Starplex. New performers included Tears For Fears, Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Joe Cocker, Steve Miller Band, The Black Crowes, Wilson Phillips, Richard Marx, Ziggy Marley, Linda Ronstadt, The Neville Brothers, Heart, Bonnie Raitt, Bad Company, Phil Collins, and Billy Idol. David Bowie brought his Sound + Vision Tour to Starplex for a special Independence Day show on July 4, 1990. Miles Davis, Chicago, Santana, Jimmy Buffett, The Moody Blues, James Taylor, The Beach Boys, and Steve Winwood all returned.

=== Coca-Cola Starplex in the 1990s ===
In the 1990s, the offerings at Starplex gradually reflected the changing landscape of music being played on the radio. The focus began to shift away from classic-rock and nostalgia acts like Yes who played there in 1991, to more alternative rock popularized by 94.5 The Edge in the Dallas market. Alternative artists like Peter Murphy, The Church, Throwing Muses, New Order, The Replacements, The Cult, Shelleyan Orphan, The Cure, Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians, Tracy Chapman, Depeche Mode, The B-52&#x27;s, Faith No More, Alice In Chains, The The, Morrissey, Blind Melon, 10,000 Maniacs, Midnight Oil, Primal Scream, Meat Puppets, The Jayhawks, Sarah McLachlan, Live, The Cranberries, Radiohead, R.E.M., Nine Inch Nails, Indigo Girls, Luscious Jackson, Los Lobos, Tori Amos, The Afghan Whigs, all played Starplex.

Many popular radio acts of the day headlined Starplex in the 1990s including Tina Turner, Michael Bolton, Harry Connick Jr., Celine Dion, Lyle Lovett, Seal, Gloria Estefan, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Alanis Morissette, Dave Matthews Band, Phish, The Wallflowers, Spice Girls, Better Than Ezra, and Garbage.

=== Alternative music festivals ===
==== Lollapalooza ====
Starplex was the site of the Lollapalooza festival tour cofounded by Perry Farrell from 1991 to 1995. The alternative music juggernaut would return each year to Starplex until 1997, when sales declined and the festival&#x27;s tastemaking cache had faded. The various lineups included:

* August 22–23, 1991: Siouxsie and the Banshees, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Violent Femmes, Rollins Band, Living Colour, and Butthole Surfers. The shows were notorious not only for record attendance for bands that were playing small clubs just a few months before, but also for the inclusion of gangsta rap pioneer Ice-T and his rap-metal outfit Body Count.
* September 6, 1992: Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry, Lush, The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, Ice Cube, and Body Count. Ticket sales were boosted both by the immense popularity of the headliners and by controversy surrounding Body Count&#x27;s &quot;Cop Killer,&quot; which was eventually removed from the group&#x27;s debut album.
* August 1, 1993: Sebadoh, Rage Against The Machine, Primus, Tool, Dinosaur Jr., Alice In Chains, and Arrested Development. The following weekend, the knockoff MTV Alternative Nation tour followed with a lineup including Spin Doctors, Soul Asylum, and Screaming Trees.
* August 20–21, 1994: The Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, L7, A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Stereolab, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, The Breeders, George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars, and The Flaming Lips. Ticket sales were strong for the 1994 festival despite the April death of Kurt Cobain, whose band Nirvana was originally set to headline the festival.
* August 10, 1995: Mike Watt, Versus, Sonic Youth, Pavement, Hole, Elastica, The Roots, Cypress Hill, Blonde Redhead and Beck.

In 1996 Lollapalooza was not presented at Starplex. On the date of the festival (July 25, 1996) Gloria Estefan had booked Starplex as part of a two-night engagement. The event was held at Old Fort Dallas in Ferris, TX with a lineup that included Metallica, Soundgarden, Ramones, Rancid, Screaming Trees, Cheap Trick, Steve Earle, Soul Coughing, Sponge, Melvins, and Jonny Polonsky.

* August 2, 1997: Devo, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Tool, James, Tricky and Snoop Dogg.

On April 19, 1992 94.5 The Edge hosted their own alternative music festival with Edgefest 1992, a one-day festival which brought together The Charlatans, The Sugarcubes, Pearl Jam, and Dramarama. To ensure maximum attendance, general admission tickets to the festival were only $9.45. On July 27, 1992 The Edge presented the Edge Birthday Bash with a one-day lineup including Peter Murphy, Material Issue, Rollins Band, The Soup Dragons and Cracker.

In subsequent years Starplex would often open each season with an Edgefest event instead of seeking a major name headliner.

In 1993 The Edge temporarily dropped the Edgefest moniker and put together the Edge Earth Day Concert on April 18, 1993, featuring The Tragically Hip, Dinosaur Jr., Jellyfish, Belly, 808 State and others. In subsequent years Edgefest continued with these lineups:

* April 17, 1994: Violent Femmes, The Charlatans, Tripping Daisy, Possum Dixon, Crash Test Dummies, and Crowded House. Crash Test Dummies also opened for Elvis Costello and the Attractions the following weekend at Starplex.
* April 22, 1995: Veruca Salt, Sponge, Letters To Cleo, Blues Traveler, and Adam Ant
* April 21, 1996: Modern English, Lush, Poe, The Verve Pipe, and The Refreshments. On June 2, 1996, The Edge presented another Edge Birthday Bash with Jewel, Cowboy Junkies, Jars Of Clay and Deep Blue Something.
* April 20, 1997: Beck, Moby, Matchbox Twenty, INXS, Ben Folds Five, Cake, and Cowboy Mouth

In 1996 the H.O.R.D.E. festival did not visit Starplex. On the date of the festival (July 19, 1996) Starplex was not booked for any event. The event was held at Texas Motorplex with a lineup that included Rusted Root, Lenny Kravitz, Leftover Salmon, Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood, Dave Matthews Band and Blues Traveler.

In 1997 headliners Widespread Panic dropped out of the H.O.R.D.E. tour at the last minute and a planned Texas stop was cancelled. Two of the planned headliners (Beck and Ben Folds Five) had played Starplex at Edgefest already in May.

King, The Temptations, Al Jarreau, Wynton Marsalis, George Benson, Whitney Houston, Buddy Guy, Janet Jackson, Anita Baker, Rick James, and Boyz II Men. The venue was slow to embrace hip-hop and rap acts except as part of festival bills: Tone Loc played Starplex on August 3, 1989, as part of the Club MTV package tour that also included Milli Vanilli, Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam, and Paula Abdul. Gangsta rap, rap-rock and rap-metal acts including Ice-T, Ice Cube, Body Count, Cypress Hill, and Snoop Dogg were booked at Starplex as part of the annual Lollapalooza tour which also featured alternative rock bands.

=== Smirnoff Music Centre 2000–2008 ===
After the naming rights to Starplex were sold to Smirnoff vodka in mid-2000, the venue dropped the Starplex moniker and was renamed Smirnoff Music Centre. The venue was sometimes billed as The Music Centre at Fair Park for all-ages shows which could not, for legal reasons, be sponsored by a producer or distributor of alcoholic beverages.

Many of the biggest music acts of the 2000s played Smirnoff Music Centre in the 2000s including Britney Spears, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Mary J. Blige, Aaron Carter, Dashboard Confessional, Pink, No Doubt, Kelly Clarkson, John Mayer, Counting Crows, 3 Doors Down, Linkin Park, Norah Jones, Oasis, Coldplay, Wu-Tang Clan and Colbie Caillat; indie heroes Queens Of The Stone Age, Bettie Serveert, The Smithereens, Weezer, Rilo Kiley and TV on the Radio; and country legends Toby Keith, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, Shooter Jennings, Drive-By Truckers, Old 97&#x27;s, and Blake Shelton.

On July 18, 2002, the Jeep World Outside festival brought Tonic, Train, O.A.R., Ziggy Marley and Sheryl Crow on July 18, 2002. The Sprite Liquid Mix tour included an eclectic bill of Hoobastank, N*E*R*D, 311 and Jay-Z. A double bill of Incubus and Phantom Planet played an Independence Day show on July 4, 2002.

=== Superpages.com Center 2008–2010 ===
At the opening of the 2008 season the naming rights for Smirnoff Music Centre expired and the venue was renamed for Superpages.com, an online business directory based in Coppell, Texas. The British spelling of the word &quot;Centre&quot; was changed to the more common American &quot;Center&quot; at the same time. The Heart Of The City package tour with Mary J. Blige, The-Dream and Jay-Z was the first engagement at Superpages.com Center on April 12, 2008. The Glow In The Dark tour with Kanye West, Rihanna, N*E*R*D and Lupe Fiasco followed weeks later on May 1, 2008. The True Colors tour assembled Cyndi Lauper, Joan Jett, The B-52&#x27;s and others on a single bill June 22, 2008. 97.5 The Eagle presented a BFD festival on July 24, 2008, with Mötley Crüe, Papa Roach, Buckcherry and others. Mayhem Festival rolled into Superpages the next day with a bill including Disturbed, Slipknot, Underoath, Mastodon, Machine Head and other Ozzfest alumni. The Eagle brought another BFD festival to Superpages August 8, 2009 with Mötley Crüe, Godsmack and Drowning Pool. Mayhem Festival also returned August 15, 2009 with Marilyn Manson, Cannibal Corpse, Slayer and others. Mayhem returned August 13, 2010 with Rob Zombie, Korn, Hatebreed, Lamb of God and others. Uproar Festival followed September 10, 2010 with Disturbed, Avenged Sevenfold and others.

Avril Lavigne, Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato, Jonas Brothers, James Blunt, Brad Paisley, Chris Cornell, The Avett Brothers, Darius Rucker, Rascal Flatts, Jason Aldean, Lil Wayne, Tim McGraw, Lady Antebellum, Sublime, Jack Johnson, Owl City, and Kings Of Leon all made their debuts at Superpages.com during this period. The Police and Anthrax also played Superpages.com for the first time, though Police frontman Sting had headlined both Starplex and Smirnoff Music Centre as a solo artist.

<doc id="452831" wikidata="Q7905616" url="?curid=452831" title="V-12 Navy College Training Program">
<text>The V-12 Navy College Training Program was designed to supplement the force of commissioned officers in the United States Navy during World War II. Between July 1, 1943, and June 30, 1946, more than 125,000 participants were enrolled in 131 colleges and universities in the United States. Numerous participants attended classes and lectures at their respective colleges and earned completion degrees for their studies. Some even returned from their naval obligations to earn a degree from the colleges where they were previously stationed.

The V-12 program&#x27;s goal was to produce officers, not unlike the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP), which sought to turn out more than 200,000 technically trained personnel in such fields as engineering, foreign languages, and medicine. Running from 1942 to 1944, the ASTP recruits were expected but not required to become officers at the end of their training.

==History==
The V-12 program was founded to generate a large number of officers for both the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps to meet the demands of World War II, in excess of the number that was turned out annually by the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and the U.S. Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School. Once enrollees completed their V-12-subsidized bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, their next step toward obtaining a commission depended on the service branch:

Navy
* Navy officer candidates were required to complete the V-7 United States Naval Reserve Midshipmen&#x27;s School program. It was a short course of eight months. The first month was spent at Indoctrination School, a &quot;boot camp&quot; for officer candidates that had Marine Corps drill instructors. Pre-Midshipmen&#x27;s School was a preparatory four-month course teaching military skills like seamanship, navigation, ordnance, and how to behave like an officer. Midshipmen&#x27;s School itself taught academic skills and was three months long. Graduates were commissioned as ensigns in the U.S. Naval Reserve and the majority entered into active duty with the U.S. fleet.

Marines
* Marine Corps candidates reported directly to boot camp and were later enrolled in a three-month officer candidate course. Once complete, participants were commissioned as second lieutenants in the Marine Corps.

===Inception===

When the United States entered the Second World War, American colleges and universities suffered huge enrollment declines. Men of prime draft age who would normally have gone into college (or would have remained enrolled until their course of study was completed) were either drafted, volunteered for service, or dropped out and took jobs in agriculture or war-related industries. As a result, some colleges worried they would have to close their doors for the duration of the conflict.

On October 14, 1942, the American Council on Education issued a report on how best to use colleges and universities for the war effort. The plan recommended that a &quot;college training corps&quot; be established on college and university campuses, that members of the corps be in uniform and receive active-duty pay, and that graduates be trained in technical specialties that were of use to the Army and the Navy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt agreed with this report, and asked the Secretary of War and Secretary of the Navy how best they could use higher education in their mobilization plans. The V-12 Navy college training program and the Army Specialized Training Program were jointly announced on December 12, 1942. The V-12 program found more favor with college administrators than did the ASTP. Unlike the ASTP, V-12 students were allowed to attend classes with civilian students and participate in athletics. The majority of the basic curriculum consisted of classes already taught by civilian instructors. Depending on the V-12 enrollees&#x27; past college curriculum, they were enrolled in three school terms, or semesters, which lasted four months each.

Captain Arthur S. Adams, from the Training Division of the Bureau of Naval Personnel, was the officer-in-charge of the V-12 program. Richard Barrett Lowe, future Governor of Guam and American Samoa, was one of its early commanding officers.

===Scope===

The V-12 program was economically and functionally beneficial to undergraduate colleges and universities in maintaining enrollments during a general mobilization of manpower for the war, and also met and exceeded the critical needs of the military.

==Participating institutions==

Unlike the ASTP, the Navy predominantly chose small, private colleges for V-12 detachments. Of the 131 institutions selected for line units, approximately 100 could be considered &quot;small,&quot; and eighty-eight were private institutions. Eleven were associated with the Roman Catholic Church. Land grant and state flagship universities accounted for only eighteen of the 131 detachments. After the V-12 Program got underway on July 1, 1943, public and private college enrollment increased by 100,000 participants, helping reverse the sharp wartime downward trend.

<text>Kreis Schubin was one of many Kreise (counties) in the northern administrative region of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen, from 1815 to 1919. Its capital was Schubin (Szubin).

==History==
The territory was created as part of the Grand Duchy of Posen (1815-1848, in personal union with Prussia) and later was part of the Prussian Province of Posen (1848-1919). On January 18, 1871, Kreis Schubin, along with all of Prussia, became part of Germany. The county&#x27;s territory was reduced significantly in 1887 when the southern half of Kreis Schubin was used to create the new Kreis Znin.

Kreis Schubin was part of the military command (German: &quot;Bezirkskommando&quot;) at Hohensalza. The main court (German: &quot;Landgericht&quot;) was in Bromberg, with lower courts (German: &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) in Schubin, Exin, and Labischin.

The Kreis was dissolved in 1919 when the territory became part of the Second Polish Republic. During World War II, the territory of the former Kreis became Landkreis Altburgund in Reichsgau Wartheland from 1939 to 1945.

== Demographics ==
== Standesämter ==
&quot;Standesamt&quot; is the German name of the local civil registration offices which were established in October 1874 soon after the German Empire was formed. Births, marriages and deaths were recorded. Previously, only duplicate copies of church records were used. By 1905, Kreis Schubin had the following 14 offices for rural residents:


Tur district was created in 1884 from parts of Netzwalde and Schubin districts. In addition, the following cities were separate districts for urban residents: Bartschin, Exin, Labischin, Schubin.

<text>The Committee on Rules (or more commonly the Rules Committee) is a committee of the United States House of Representatives. It is responsible for the rules under which bills will be presented to the House of Representatives, unlike other committees, which often deal with a specific area of policy. The committee is often considered one of the most powerful committees as it influences the introduction and process of legislation through the House. Thus it has garnered the nickname the &quot;traffic cop of Congress&quot;. A &quot;special rule&quot; resolution (also referred to simply as a &quot;rule&quot;) is a simple resolution of the House of Representatives, usually reported by the Committee on Rules, to permit the immediate consideration of a legislative measure, notwithstanding the usual order of business, and to prescribe conditions for its debate and amendment.

==Jurisdiction==
When a bill is reported out of one of the other committees, it does not go straight to the House floor, because the House, unlike the United States Senate, does not have unlimited debate and discussion on a bill. Instead, what may be said and done to a bill is strictly limited. This limitation is performed by the Rules Committee.
=== Special rules ===
When a bill is reported out of another committee with legislative jurisdiction, it is placed on the appropriate House Calendar for debate. Common practice, though, is for bills reported from committees to be considered in the Rules Committee, which then passes a so-called &quot;special rule&quot; (a resolution allowing for consideration of a bill, establishing how long and under what rules the full body will debate the proposition). A &quot;special rule&quot; resolution (also known simply as a &quot;rule&quot;) is privileged under the Standing Rules of the House, meaning it is immediately subject to a debate and a vote by the full House upon being reported by the Rules Committee. If a &quot;special rule&quot; resolution providing for consideration of a bill is passed, then such bill must be considered by the House at such a time and under such limitations as the resolution has set. In practice, a bill can get to a floor vote only if a &quot;special rule&quot; resolution providing for its consideration is passed (unless the Speaker grants a vote on suspension of the rules, which requires two-thirds of votes cast in order to pass).

Consideration by the full body can occur in one of two forums: the Committee of the Whole, or on the floor of the full House of Representatives itself. Different traditions govern whether the Committee of the Whole or the House itself will debate a given resolution, and the Rules Committee generally sets the forum under which a proposition will be debated and the amendment/time limitations for every measure, too. For instance, there might be a limit on the number or types of amendments (proposed changes to the bill). Amendments might only be allowed to specific sections of the bill, or no amendments might be allowed at all. Besides control over amendments, the rule issued by the Rules Committee also determines the amount of speaking time assigned on each bill or resolution. If the leadership wants a bill pushed forward quietly, for instance, there might be no debate time scheduled; if they want attention, they might allow time for lengthy speeches in support of the bill.

Between control over amendments, debate, and when measures will be considered, the Rules Committee exerts vast power in the House. As such, the majority party will usually be very keen on controlling it tightly. While most House committees maintain membership in a rough proportion to the full chamber (if the majority party controls 55% of the House, it will tend to have 55% of committee seats), membership on the Rules Committee is disproportionately in favor of the majority party. Furthermore, the rules committee typically operates in a very partisan fashion, advancing &quot;special rule&quot; resolutions to the floor on straight party line votes in nearly all cases.

==History==
The Rules Committee was formed on April 2, 1789, during the first Congress. However, it had nowhere near the powerful role it has today. Instead, it merely proposed general rules for the House to follow when debating bills (rather than passing a special rule for each bill), and was dissolved after proposing these general rules. These general rules still have a great impact on the tone of the House floor today.

The Rules Committee, for a long time, lay dormant. For the first fifty years of its existence, it accomplished little beyond simply reaffirming these rules, and its role was very noncontroversial. On June 16, 1841, it made a major policy change, reducing from to the fraction of votes needed in the House to close debate and vote on a bill.

In 1880, the modern Rules Committee began to emerge from the reorganization of the House Committees. When the Republican Party took over the House in the election of 1880, they quickly realized the power that the Rules Committee possessed. One member, Thomas Brackett Reed (R-Maine), used a seat on the Rules Committee to vault himself to the Speakership, and gained so much power that he was referred to as &quot;Czar Reed&quot;.

In the 1890s and 1900s, Reed and his successor, Joseph Gurney Cannon (R-Illinois) used the Rules Committee to centralize the power of the Speakership. Although their power to place members in committees and perform other functions was limited by a forced rule change in 1910, the Rules Committee retained its power. However, it ceased to function as the personal project of the Speaker, as it had originally; instead, as the seniority system took root, it was captured by a coalition of conservative Democrats and Republicans. This state of affairs would continue until the 1960s.

In 1961, Speaker Sam Rayburn (D-Texas), acting on the wishes of the new President John F. Kennedy and the Democratic Study Group, introduced a bill to enlarge the committee from 12 members to 15, to decrease the power of the arch-conservative chairman, Howard W. Smith (D-Virginia). The bill passed, 217 votes to 212. However, it was only partially successful; the Rules Committee continued to block legislation including civil rights and education bills.

In the 1970s, however, the Rules Committee was firmly under the command of the Speaker once again. As before, its primary role is to come up with special rules, to help or obstruct the chances of legislation reported to it.

==General types of rules==

The Rules Committee issues the following types of &quot;special rule&quot; resolutions:
* Open rule: Allows any member to offer any amendment in compliance with house rules under the five minute rule (a member argues for the amendment for 5 minutes, an opponent then argues against the amendment for 5 minutes, other members may then &quot;strike the last word&quot; to speak further on the Amendment, and the house then votes on the amendment). Debate continues until no one offers an amendment. This type of Rule has not been used since June 10, 2014.
* Modified open rule: Much like an open rule, but may require amendments to be preprinted in the congressional record beforehand, and may impose a total time limit for the consideration of all amendments, or for debate on each amendment.
* Structured rule – Members submit amendments to the rules committee, and the rules committee selects which amendments may be considered on the floor.
* Closed rule – Eliminates the opportunity to amend the bill on the floor, except under unanimous consent.

Most &quot;special rule&quot; resolutions offer time for &quot;general debate&quot; before any amendment consideration begins (it is also possible for the rules committee to issue a rule for &quot;general debate&quot; only and later issue a second rule for amendment consideration) and allow for one motion to send the bill back to its committee of origination, with or without instructions for how to modify the bill. Such resolutions may also include necessary authority for district work periods, and may waive or modify certain points of order or rules of the house if desired by the committee, and the committee is also allowed to self-execute amendments right in the rule rather than delegating this ability to the full house floor.

==Chairs, 1849–1853 and 1880–present==
The Committee on Rules was created as a select committee but became a standing committee for the 31st and 32nd Congresses (1849–1853). In 1853, the panel reverted to being a select committee and remained one until 1880.

From 1880 to the revolt against Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon in March 1910, the Speaker of the House also served as Chairman of the Rules Committee.

Beginning in 1999 with the chairmanship of Republican David Dreier of California, the chairman of the Rules Committee became a member of the elected Republican leadership, appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Howard W. Smith of Virginia is the longest-serving chairman (1955–1967) since the committee&#x27;s founding. David Dreier of California is the youngest chairman of the Rules Committee, assuming the position at the age of 46. He is also the longest-serving chairman (1999-2007, 2011–2013) since 1967. Louise Slaughter of New York is the first woman to chair the committee (2007–2011).

<doc id="452841" wikidata="Q1719118" url="?curid=452841" title="Kreis Wirsitz">
<text>Kreis Wirsitz was one of 14 or 15 Kreise (English: &quot;counties&quot;) in the northern administrative district of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen. The county existed with essentially the same boundaries beginning in 1815 as a German &quot;Kreise&quot; then from 1919 as a Polish &quot;Powiat&quot; until 1975. Its administrative center was the town of Wyrzysk (Wirsitz). The county contained additional municipalities such as Bialosliwie, Lobzenica (Lobsens), Miasteczko Krajeńskie (Friedheim), Mrocza (Mrotschen), Nakło nad Notecią (Nakel), Sadki and Wysoka (Wissek) plus over 100 villages. Many villages that had Germanic names were changed to completely different Polish names following World War II, such as Radzicz (formerly Hermannsdorf). In 1954 the central government abolished the commune (Polish: &quot;gmina&quot;) as the smallest unit of government, dividing the county into 28 clusters. In 1973 municipalities were restored. After the administrative reform of 1975, the territory of the county was divided between the new (lower) region of Bydgoszcz and the region Piła. The territory of the defunct county was annexed by Naklo County, Kujavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship and Pila County, Greater Poland Voivodeship. Wyrzysk was incorporated into Piła County.

== History ==
The area around the town of Wyrzysk, then part of the Duchy of Warsaw, became part of the Grand Duchy of Posen on 15 May 1815 as accorded at the Congress of Vienna. The rather titulary Grand Duchy of Posen, held by the Hohenzollern, the ruling family in the Kingdom of Prussia, was in fact an autonomous province within Prussia, but not belonging to those territories covered by the loose league called the German Confederation. Its constitutional peculiarity had been abolished on 5 December 1848, when it was converted into the Prussian Province of Posen, by way of which it was transformed into one of Prussia&#x27;s regional subdivisions, but still no part of the German Confederation.
On 1 July 1816 the county of Wyrzysk (German: &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot;) was formed. After a territorial reorganisation within the Kingdom of Prussia the borders of the &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; were partly redrawn, so that by 1 January 1818 the municipality of Kcynia (German: &quot;Exin&quot;) became a part of the neighbouring county of Schubin (Polish: &quot;Szubin&quot;). The town of Wyrzysk (German: &quot;Wirsitz&quot;) domiciled the county administration.

Being an administrative unit of the Kingdom of Prussia the &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; joined the newly founded North German Confederation in July 1867, becoming thereby for the first time part of a German commonwealth. By way of unification of German states the North German Confederation had been enlarged by southern German states and constitutionally reinforced to become a united Germany on 18 January 1871 with &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; being part of it.

The members of the German parliament (German: &quot;Reichstag&quot;) forming the Polish National Democratic Party (Polish: &quot;Stronnictwo Narodowo-Demokratyczne&quot;), led by Władysław Taczanowski (1825–1893), protested on 1 April 1871 in the parliament of the newly founded united Germany against Prussia joining with all her provinces united Germany.

On 27 December 1918 the Greater Poland uprising started and involved most of the Prussian Province of Posen, where Poles formed the majority. While the Uprising, terminated by a German-Polish ceasefire agreed on 16 February 1919, led to an end of German rule in most of the territory of the Province of Posen, its northern outskirts including the &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; remained calm and under German control. This may be because it had a German majority population. According to the Prussian census of 1858, Kreis Wirsitz had a population of 54,044, of which 29,339 (54.3%) were Germans and 24,705 (45.7%) were Poles.

== Demographics ==
==Powiat Wyrzyski (1919-1939)==
By the Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919 Germany ceded the &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; to the newly reestablished Poland. On 25 November 1919 both countries agreed upon how to hand over the territories ceded to Poland, but still held by Germany. This agreement was ratified on 10 January 1920. So official representatives of Germany (soldiers, government officials and the like) left the &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; between 17 January and 4 February 1920, which was then factually taken over by Poland.

The &quot;Kreis Wirsitz&quot; officially became the &quot;powiat Wyrzyski&quot; (Polish for county of Wyrzysk). The population of ceded territories was entitled to choose to become Poles or remain Germans. Many ethnic Germans emigrated to Germany (so-called optants, who opted not to become Poles). This emigration and intra-Polish migration resulted in figures as measured in the Polish census of 1931. Then 20.5% of the county&#x27;s population were Germans.

On 1 April 1938 the &quot;powiat Wyrzyski&quot; was ceded from the Poznań Voivodeship (the Polish name of the Province of Posen), to the Voivodeship of Pomerania which was renamed the Greater Pomerania (Polish: &quot;Województwo Wielkopomorskie&quot;). Covering most of the territory of historical Pomerelia, this voivodeship is also called Voivodeship of Pomerelia, to avoid confusion with the Prussian Province of Pomerania, with the Free State of Prussia being a federal state of Germany.

==Landkreis Wirsitz (1939-1945)==
A few days after the beginning of World War II, being along the border of Prussia and due to the routing of the Ostbahn this strategically important county was occupied by German troops. On 26 October 1939, German administration as a Landkreis began under the old name &quot;Wirsitz&quot;. Contrary to international treaties, the county and its province were annexed unilaterally by the German Reich. With the invasion of the Soviet Red Army in January 1945, the county was returned to Polish administration under the old name &quot;powiat Wyrzyski&quot;.

==Powiat Wyrzyski (1945-1975)==
For more about powiat Wyrzyski, which ceased to exist in 1975 cf. the Polish site .

== Geographical features ==
== Military command ==
Kreis Wirsitz was part of the military command in Posen (German: &quot;Bezirkskommando&quot;) at Bromberg.

== Court system ==
The main court (German: &quot;Landgericht&quot;) was in Schneidemühl, with lower courts (German: &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) in Wirsitz, Lobsens and Nakel.

<text>Kreis Wongrowitz (until 1875 Kreis Wongrowiec) was one of several districts in the northern administrative region of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen.

==History==
The district of Wongrowiec was initially a district in the Prussian province of South Prussia, which became part of Prussia after the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. With the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807, it passed to the Duchy of Warsaw. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the district was returned to Prussia and became part of Bromberg Region in the Grand Duchy of Posen and from 1848, the Province of Posen. The district capital was the town of Wongrowiec.

As part of the Province of Posen, the Wongrowiec district became part of the German Empire in 1871. In 1875 the town and the district of &quot;Wongrowiec were&quot; renamed &quot;Wongrowitz&quot;. In 1887, a large part of the district, including the town of Janowiec Wielkopolski was ceded to the newly formed Znin district.

On December 27, 1918, the Greater Poland uprising began in the province of Posen, and by December 30, 1918, the district town of Wongrowitz was under Polish control. On February 16, 1919, an armistice ended the Polish-German fighting, and on June 28, 1919, the German government officially ceded the Wongrowitz district to the Second Polish Republic with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

== Demographics ==
According to the census of 1858, Kreis Wongrowitz had a population of 51,127, of which 13,230 (25.9%) were Germans and 37,897 (74.1%) were Poles.

<text>Kreis Znin was one of many Kreise (counties) in the northern administrative region of Bromberg, in the Prussian province of Posen, from 1887-1919. Its capital was Znin.

== History ==

Kreis Znin was created in 1887 out of parts of Kreis Schubin, Kreis Mogilno, and Kreis Wongrowitz. The end of the 19th century was a period of intensive economic development for both urban and rural areas. A sugar factory was built in 1893-94.

Kreis Znin was part of the military command (German: &quot;Bezirkskommando&quot;) at Gnesen (Gniezno). The main court (German: &quot;Landgericht&quot;) was in Bromberg (Bydgoszcz), with a lower court (German: &quot;Amtsgericht&quot;) in the capital city Znin. Each of the cities Gonsawa, Janowitz, Rogowo, and Znin held headquarters of a police district (German: &quot;Polizeidistrikt&quot;).

Rebels from the territory participated in the Greater Poland Uprising in 1919 after World War I. The Kreis was dissolved in 1919 when the territory became part of the Second Polish Republic. During World War II, the territory of the former Kreis became Landkreis Dietfurt (Wartheland), 1939-1945.

== Demographics ==
According to the census of 1910, the district had a population of 40,210, of which 29,156 (72.51%) spoke Polish, 10,906 (27.12%) spoke German and 133 (0.33%) identified as bilingual.

== Transportation ==

A narrow-gauged railway line of the Prussian Eastern Railway through Żnin was completed from 1894-95. The first section of the 600 mm gauge &quot;Kleinbahn des Kreises Znin&quot; (local line of Znin County) opened from Znin to Rogowo (19.4 km) on 1 July 1894, together with a branch from Biskupin through Gąsawa to Szelejewo (8.2 km). On 9 June 1895 the Rogowo line was extended by 12.3 km to Ośno. In 1908 a branch to Ostrowce was added, and in 1911 a further 15.8 km branch opened to Obiecanowo. In the following year another 5.5 km branch opened to Wola, and in 1913 the Szelejewo line was extended to Grochowiska Szlacheckie. Finally, a 2 km section from Obiecanowo to Żużoły brought the system up to 78 km.

On 1 June 1889, a railway connection to the regular railway network was completed. This provided direct trains to Hohensalza (Inowrocław), Damasławek, and Rogasen (Rogoźno). By 1 November 1895 it was also connected to Bromberg.

The Wenecja Railway Museum opened in 1972, and contains a collection of at least 17 steam locomotives and a variety of rolling stock and other items. It is situated beside the railway, but the display tracks are not connected to the running lines. The railway also runs past the archaeological museum at Biskupin.

== Standesämter ==
&quot;Standesamt&quot; is the German name of the local civil registration offices which were established in October 1874 soon after the German Empire was formed. Births, marriages and deaths were recorded. Previously, only duplicate copies of church records were used. By 1905, Kreis Znin had the following 13 offices for rural residents:

<text>El Yunque or El Yunque Peak (Spanish: Pico El Yunque) (Taíno: &quot;Yukiyu&quot;) is a mountain located fully within the boundaries of the El Yunque National Forest, part of the U.S. Forest Service, which is the only tropical rainforest under the U.S. Forest Service jurisdiction. It is located in the municipality of Río Grande.

==Background==
The peak itself, standing at above sea level is not the highest in Puerto Rico or even the Sierra de Luquillo range where it is located. It is however the most famous peak due to its curious shape, its natural environment and history, and for its cultural importance to the Taino people. The peak is nearly always covered in thin mist and due to its high humidity, a quick shower develops during some afternoons. The hike to the top from the Mina Falls is not challenging yet it takes almost hours.

This peak is located on the El Yunque massif which also contains other smaller peaks such as Mount Britton, Juan Diego Peak and the Roca del Yunque which is a rocky peak close to the summit of El Yunque. El Yunque massif itself is part of the Sierra de Luquillo. The highest point in the Sierra de Luquillo is El Toro (Spanish for &quot;the bull&quot;) located in the municipal boundary between Río Grande and Las Piedras, which lends its name to the El Toro Wilderness.

==Climate==
El Yunque is classified as having a tropical rainforest climate, Köppen climate type &#x27;Af&#x27;, along with surrounding areas, approximating a subtropical highland climate at the peak. The average temperature of the park is 70 °F, and seasonal variation virtually nonexistent. The rugged area can receive over 200 inches (5080 millimeters) of annual rainfall and is the rainiest of all US national forests.

== Access ==
It is accessible via Mt Britton trail near the end of PR 191, which starts in PR 3 in the small town of Palmer. The best access from San Juan is via PR 66 toll express in 1 hr. which exits to PR 3. At the end of PR 191 in El Yunque there is a loop that goes to the entrance of the Mt Britton trail - close to El Yunque peak. It is one of the few places close to this trail with about 15 parking spots.

This trail is mostly paved and leads to the Mt Britton tower, the Three Peaks (Tres Picachos), the spur trail, and finally El Yunque peak with communications systems (towers) and then a small tower in the peak. The main road PR 191 has a gate at the end and after this there is a maintenance road to El Yunque and then the closed section of PR 191 which is about 3 hours long - a road that is being reclaimed by the forest and is closed due to a massive landslide. There is also the entrance the Tradewinds trail - possibly the longest trail of the park, which ends in El Toro Peak.

Its summit provides views of the other peaks of El Yunque, the vast rainforest below, and the rest of the island. The river in PR 191 called Quebrada Juan Diego is just below this peak and has a trails, waterfalls and ponds.

<text>El Yunque National Forest (), formerly known as the Caribbean National Forest (or &quot;Bosque Nacional del Caribe&quot;), is a forest located in northeastern Puerto Rico. While there are both temperate and tropical rainforests in other states and territories, it is the only tropical rainforest in the United States National Forest System and the United States Forest Service. El Yunque National Forest is located on the slopes of the Sierra de Luquillo mountains, encompassing more than 28,000 acres (43.753 mi2 or 113.32 km2) of land, making it the largest block of public land in Puerto Rico.

The forest contains and is named after named Pico El Yunque, the second highest mountain in the Sierra de Luquillo. Other peaks within the national forest are Pico del Este, Pico del Oeste, El Cacique and the highest peak, El Toro, which is the highest point in the national forest and in eastern Puerto Rico rising 3,494 feet (1,065 m) above sea level.

Ample rainfall (over 20 feet a year in some areas, or an average of 120 inches of water up to 240 inches of water a year) creates a jungle-like setting—lush foliage, crags, waterfalls, and rivers are a frequent sight. The forest has a number of trails from which the jungle-like territory&#x27;s flora and fauna can be appreciated. El Yunque forest is also renowned for its unique Taíno petroglyphs. It is said that indigenous people believed that El Yunque was the throne of their chief god Yúcahu, so that it is the Caribbean equivalent to Mount Olympus in Greek mythology.

== Naming and etymology ==
&quot;El Yunque&quot; is the name of the mountain peak, Pico El Yunque, the name of the forest and, colloquially on some occasions, the name for the entire Sierra de Luquillo range. &quot;El Yunque&quot; most likely comes from or relates to the Spanish word &quot;yunque&quot;, meaning anvil. This name references the relatively high and flat shape of the Sierra de Luquillo range when observed from the north (El Yunque Peak) or the south (El Toro). It is also said that the Spanish name might have been influenced by the native names for the mountain: &quot;Yukén&quot; or &quot;Yuke&quot; possibly meaning &quot;white land&quot;, and &quot;Luquillo&quot; or &quot;Yukiyu&quot;, another name for the spirit or deity Yokahu and also the name of a legendary cacique, Loquillo. It is not known whether the mountain gives its name to the range or vice versa.

== History ==

The area of the El Yunque National Forest has been notable since the pre-Columbian era. The forest today is home to several archaeological sites related to the indigenous Taínos, such as the Río Blanco petroglyphs, although no evidence of permanent settlement has been found in the area, which suggests that it was possibly avoided and most likely considered sacred.The Spanish began the conquest the island of Borinquen in 1493, and gold was soon found in the Fajardo and Blanco Rivers in 1509, which sparked interest in gold mining in the area. By 1513 there were gold mines in both river areas and gold was soon found in other rivers of the mountain range such as the Sabana, Prieto, La Mina, Mameyes, Espíritu Santo and Canóvanas rivers. The period of gold mining in the area however ended in 1530 when miners and settlers started being attacked by rebelling Taínos, and the area would not be settled again until the 17th century. The area where El Portal Rainforest Visitor Center is located used to be the site of a coffee plantation named &quot;Hacienda Catalina&quot;. Coffee was introduced and cultivated in the slopes of El Yunque in the 1730s but the area remained relatively untouched until the 19th century when the lowland forests were exploited for timber and cut down for the development of agriculture, which attracted the attention of the Spanish Crown. The forest during this time was part of the Crown lands of Puerto Rico and in 1853 the Spanish government sent foresters from the &quot;Inspección de Montes&quot; (the Spanish Forest Service) to survey the land. Due to the rapid population growth in the island and the poor farming practices of the impoverished European immigrants of the time, the forest region was formally set aside in 1876 by King Alfonso XII of Spain with the purpose of preserving the soil and water resources and regulating the timber industry in the region. This makes El Yunque one of the oldest reserves in the Western Hemisphere, only four years younger than Yellowstone National Park.
The Spanish Crown ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in 1898. At the time, most of the original forests in Puerto Rico had been either cut or burned down, and the highlands of the Sierra de Luquillo contained the last remaining tracts of untouched forest in the island. President Theodore Roosevelt set aside the previous Crown Lands of El Yunque area, and the Luquillo Forest Reserve was established on January 17, 1903, by the United States General Land Office with . It became a National Forest in 1906 and renamed the Caribbean National Forest on June 4, 1935. The forest was still used for timber during the First and Second World Wars, and several military installations such as radars and communications infrastructure were installed in the forest, particularly on the highest peaks, such as the early-warning radar site installed in Pico El Yunque to observe and protect against possible incursions by German aircraft and submarines.

The Caribbean National Forest was designated an &quot;Insular Wildlife Refuge&quot; by the US Department of Agriculture in 1946, and reforestation efforts were also established between 1934 and 1948 to revitalize the parts of the forest that had been formerly lost due to human activity. The Luquillo Experimental Forest was established in 1956 to promote scientific research and expand conservation efforts for the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot and the recently discovered yet endangered elfin woods warbler. Most of the recreational infrastructure was developed in the 1980s and the field offices were moved to their current location in 1981. The National Science Foundation established &quot;El Verde Field Station&quot; in 1988 under an agreement with the US Forest Service as a primary site for the &quot;Luquillo Long-Term ecological Research&quot; (Luquillo-LTER, now managed by the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras) with the goal of supporting scientific research of tropical ecosystems due to the occurrence of five out of six of Holdridge&#x27;s life zones and forest types.
The forest was heavily damaged by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Hurricane Georges in 1998, and it is estimated that only 23 individual parrots remained in the wild afterwards. Between 2000 and 2002, 35 captive parrots were released into the wild as part of a program to save the critically endangered bird. An executive order signed by President George W. Bush on April 2, 2007, changed the name of the Caribbean National Forest to El Yunque National Forest, better reflecting the cultural and historical feelings of the Puerto Rican people. Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused deforestation, landslides and heavy damage to the forest and its infrastructure in 2017, drastically reducing the Puerto Rican parrot population once again. As of 2020 the population has begun to recover and the captive population&#x27;s reproduction rates has also doubled under the supervision of the Fish and Wildlife Service. The Portal Rainforest Visitor Center reopened at the end of 2021, after being reconstructed following Hurricane Maria. El Yunque National Forest today extends over 28,000 acres through the municipalities of Río Grande, Luquillo, Naguabo, Ceiba, Fajardo, Canóvanas, Las Piedras and Juncos.

== Climate ==
Puerto Rico has a tropical climate, specifically a tropical rainforest climate, while higher elevations over 3,000 feet border on a subtropical highland climate. There is no distinct wet or dry season in El Yunque; it rains year-round. The temperature and length of daylight remain fairly constant throughout the year. The average temperature in the summer is 80 °F (26 °C) high and 68 °F (20 °C) low and in the winter 72 °F (22 °C) high and 58 °F (15 °C) low, Temperatures can drop below 50 °F (10 °C) on clear nights during the winter, but never below freezing. All of these factors provide a year-round growing season.

== Ecology and conservation ==
Its ecosystem is specifically surveyed by the Management Team of Ecosystems (Equipo de Manejos de Ecosistemas), which is led by Pedro Rios. Due to its location in the northeastern part of Puerto Rico, the incoming trade winds from the Atlantic Ocean bash into the mountains, leading to an excess of rainfall registered at about per year. This process is called orographic lift and accounts for the intense rainfall and constant cloud presence in this mountainous region. This constant cloud cover and persistent winds produced by the adiabatic process of air particles rushing up through the mountainside has affected the morphology of El Yunque, but the most effect has been on the &quot;bosque enano&quot; or dwarf forest.

The forest is home to over 200 species of trees and plants, 16 of which are endemic to the forest. The critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon (&quot;Amazona vittata&quot;), with an estimated wild population of 58–80 individuals in the wild, occurred exclusively in this forest until November 19, 2006, when another wild population was released by the Department of Natural Resources in the municipality of Utuado&#x27;s Río Abajo State Forest.

El Yunque National Forest contains one designated wilderness area, El Toro Wilderness, which is the only tropical rainforest in the United States National Wilderness Preservation System.

=== Baño de Oro Natural Area ===
The Baño de Oro Natural Area is an 1,840-acre Research Natural Area and National Natural Landmark located within El Yunque National Forest. The Research Natural Area was established by the United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Forest Service in 1949 with the goal of preserving a forest area situated between 800 ft. and 3,365 ft. in elevation encompassing two life zones, a rare &quot;Pterocarpus&quot; swamp, and four major forest types that are free of human disturbance for the purpose of scientific study, education and future conservation efforts. Baño de Oro is listed as a National Natural Landmark since 1980.

== Flora ==
El Yunque is composed of four different forest vegetation areas: Tabonuco Forest, Palo Colorado Forest, Sierra Palm Forest, and the Dwarf forest. El Yunque forest supports a vast array of animal and plant life that varies depending on the altitude range in the rainforest.

=== Sierra palm tree forest ===

This forest area is located at 1,970 feet (600 m) above sea level and is dominated by the Sierra palm tree (&quot;Prestoea montana&quot;). This palm tree can be found throughout the national forest but the shallowness of the soil makes it the dominant tree at this height of the forest.

=== Palo colorado forest ===
This forest area is found above 2,500 feet (600–900 m) above sea level and is dominated by the &quot;palo colorado&quot; (&quot;Cyrilla racemiflora&quot;). The most distinctive features of this tree are its red crooked bark which gives it its Spanish name. These trees are not endemic to the island but they are native to the region. This forest area is a partial old growth forest and some of the &quot;palo colorado&quot; trees are estimated to be up to 1,000 years old. Due to the shallowness of its bark, the trunks of these trees are commonly used as nesting sites by endangered Puerto Rican parrots (&quot;Amazona vittata&quot;).

Other trees found in the &quot;palo colorado&quot; forest area &quot;caimitillo&quot; (&quot;Micropholis garcinifolia&quot;), green &quot;caimitillo&quot; (&quot;Micropholis garciniaefolia&quot;), yarumo (&quot;Cecropia peltata&quot;), Caribbean &quot;azafran&quot; (&quot;Hedyosmum arborencens&quot;) and the Sierra palm tree (&quot;Prestoea montana&quot;).

=== Tabonuco forest ===
The tabonuco tree (&quot;Dacryodes excelsa&quot;) from which this forest area got its name occurs from 660 to 2800 feet (200 to 900 meters) in the mountains of Puerto Rico as well as other islands that make up the Antilles. The laurel magnolia (&quot;Magnolia splendens&quot;), an endangered magnolia tree that is endemic to eastern Puerto Rico, can be found in this forest area as well. This forest is very diverse in trees, having over 170 species such as bulletwood (&quot;Manilkara bidentata&quot;), West Indian giant fern (&quot;Cyathea arborea&quot;), yarumo (&quot;Cecropia peltata&quot;), macho yarumo (&quot;Didymopanax morototoni&quot;), granadillo (&quot;Buchenavia capitata&quot;) and guaraguao tree (&quot;Guarea guidona&quot;).

=== Dwarf forest (cloud forest) ===
The dwarf forest ecosystem is located at around and composes the smallest sub-region in El Yunque forest. The forest is characterized by the variation of vegetation that is only found in Puerto Rico. The vegetation shows stunted growth in which the diameter of the trunk is widened and the number of leaves on the branches is lower than expected. Other specific factors that affect the growth of this sub-region are the high level of acidity and poor water runoff from the soil.

Although many species have adapted to these harsh environments, five species are frequent in the dwarf forest: &quot;Ocotea spathulata&quot;, &quot;Tabebuia rigida&quot;, &quot;Calyptranthes krugii&quot;, &quot;Eugenia borinquensis&quot; and &quot;Calycogonium squamulosum&quot;. The other abundant type of plants in the dwarf forest are epiphytes. The great amount of competition in the canopy does not allow lower-level plants to develop and prosper. The characteristic of having a widened tree trunk is ideal for epiphytes that require a host to live. Therefore, a substantial number of epiphytic plants have cemented their existence in the flora of El Yunque forest, specifically in the dwarf forest due to the moisture, precipitation and protection from the sun.

== Fauna ==
The national forest is home to numerous species of animals, many of which are endemic to Puerto Rico. In addition to the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot, other endangered species found in the forest are the Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (&quot;Buteo platypterus brunnescens&quot;), the Puerto Rican sharp-shinned hawk (&quot;Accipiter striatus venator&quot;), the Elfin woods warbler (&quot;Setophaga angelae&quot;) and the Puerto Rican boa (&quot;Epicratus inornatus&quot;). The white-necked crow (&quot;Corvus leucognaphalus&quot;), which used to be found in the region, has been completely extirpated from the island and is now only found in Hispaniola.

Other animals found within the forest boundaries are the Puerto Rican oriole (&quot;Icterus portoricensis&quot;), the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), red fruit bat (&quot;Stenoderma rufus&quot;), the Puerto Rican giant anole (&quot;Anolis cuvieri&quot;) and the Puerto Rican twig anole (&quot;Anolis occultus&quot;). The endangered American eel (&quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;), the fat sleeper fish (&quot;Dormitator maculatus&quot;), the bigmouth sleeper fish (&quot;Gobiomorus dormitor&quot;), big claw river shrimp (&quot;Macrobrachium carcinus&quot;) and the bocú shrimp (&quot;Macrobrachium crenulatum&quot;) are found in the rivers and creeks that originate and flow from El Yunque.

=== Puerto Rican Amazon ===
The Puerto Rican parrot or Puerto Rican Amazon is a little parrot that measures 11.0–11.8 in (28–30 cm). The bird is a predominantly green parrot with a red forehead and white rings around the eyes. The species is the only remaining native parrot in Puerto Rico. The total estimated population as of 2012 was 58–80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.

=== Coqui ===

Approximately 16 species of common coqui, members of the diverse neotropical frog genus &quot;Eleutherodactylus&quot;, are known in Puerto Rico. Of these 16, 13 have been found in El Yunque National Forest. This small frog earned its Puerto Rican common name due to the call of the most common coquí species in Puerto Rico, &quot;Eleutherodactylus coqui&quot;, which begins as the sun sets and ends in early dawn. This has made it an animal of great endearment to Puerto Ricans and in contemporary times the coqui has become a symbol of Puerto Ricans.

Although the coquí is an amphibian, it possesses some features that are unusual in frogs. These differences are seen mainly in its morphology, reproduction, and developmental stages. In terms of morphology, the coquí does not have webbing between its toes because it is a tree dweller in moist environments. Another significant difference is that it does not have a definite larval stage and the eggs laid by the female are terrestrial instead of aquatic. This means that a miniature frog-let, rather than a tadpole, arises from the incubation period.

Other species of coqui found in the forest are the grass coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus brittoni&quot;), Eneida&#x27;s coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus eneidae&quot;), the cricket coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus gryllus&quot;), Hedrick&#x27;s coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus hedricki&quot;), the web-footed coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus karlschmidti&quot;), the locust coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus locustus&quot;), the upland or forest coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus portoricensis&quot;), the bronze or Richmond&#x27;s coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus richmondi&quot;), the dwarf coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus unicolor&quot;) and the melodious or wrinkled coqui (&quot;Eleutherodactylus wightmanae&quot;).

=== Arthropods ===
Per a study published October 2018, by Bradford C. Lister and Andres Garcia, arthropod biomass in the Luquillo rainforest data taken during the 1970s compared to 30 years later has fallen 10 to 60 times. The study revealed synchronous declines in the lizards, frogs, and birds that eat arthropods. The study indicated that climate warming is the driving force behind the collapse of the forest&#x27;s food web. Over the past 30 years, forest temperatures have risen 2.0 °C.

== Recreation ==
In addition to being an important ecological forest reserve, El Yunque National Forest is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Puerto Rico, both for locals and visitors, and it offers numerous recreational opportunities such as picnicking, birdwatching, and biking in designated areas. Camping is allowed in designated areas (depending on the size of the group) and there are also cabins available for rent. Additionally, the forest is known for its vista points and observation towers: Yokahu Tower and Mount Britton Tower.

=== Hiking Trails ===
Hiking is probably the most popular activity in El Yunque National Forest. The forest offers several trails with varying difficulties. The 35.9-mile (57.8 km) long Puerto Rican Northeast Trail also connects to and traverses through El Yunque.

==== Pico El Yunque ====
Pico El Yunque Trail (or just El Yunque Trail) is the main hiking trail (or at least the most popular) of the forest and it extends for about 5.4 miles that lead to the summit of El Yunque, the second highest point of the Sierra de Luquillo. Although considered moderate in difficulty, some of its side trails are considered to be more challenging; the trail itself has an elevation gain of 1,748 feet. The trailhead is located close to the end of PR-191 and La Mina Falls, next to the Palo Colorado Information Center, in an area of the national forest often referred to as the La Mina Recreational Area. The trail crosses all four biomes of the national forest. It is open year-round and dogs are also allowed on this trail but must be kept on a leash at all times.

==== Mount Britton Tower ====
Mt. Britton Tower Trail is a small 1.6-mile trail that starts off at El Yunque Trail and crosses a Sierra palm forest on the way to the top of Mount Britton, the 8th tallest peak in the forest. The summit is part of the cloud forest and it hosts a small lookout tower built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1937 that on clear days offers views of both the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The trail has an elevation gain of approximately 650 feet and although it is rated as moderate to difficult.

==== Los Picachos ====
The very short but steep trail starts off Pico El Yunque Trail and it extends for little more than 0.2 miles to the top, where a stone masonry platform offers a 360 panoramic view of the surrounding mountains and the eastern coast of Puerto Rico. The vegetation along this trail belongs to that of the rare dwarf forest ecosystem which features &quot;dwarf trees&quot; such as the miniature tree &quot;Clusia clusioides&quot;, and equally small species of animals such as the dwarf anole (&quot;Anolis occultus&quot;) and the endangered elfin woods warbler (&quot;Setophaga angelae&quot;). This ecological zone is also known as the elfin woodlands. Although very short, the trail difficulty is classified as moderate to difficult.

==== Caimitillo ====
This is a short and easy 0.4-mile trail that begins close to the Sierra Palm Visitor Center on PR-191. The trail crosses a rainy forest primarily inhabited by tree ferns (&quot;Cyathea arborea&quot; and &quot;Alsophila dryopteroides&quot;) and Sierra palm trees. The trail leads to the Caimitillo picnic area. Dogs are also allowed on this trail but must be kept on a leash at all times.

==== Angelito ====
The Angelito Trail is an easy short 0.7-mile-long trail that crosses the tabonuco forest zone leads to the Las Damas Pool, also known as Charco Angelito, a series of natural pools along the Mameyes River. Although the trail is easy visitors must be cautious of the weather since the area is prone to flash flooding. The trail and area were heavily damaged during Hurricane Maria in 2017 but it has recently reopened. Dogs are allowed on the trail but must be kept on a leash. The trailhead is located on PR-988. This trail is the only one in the forest to be located in the municipality of Luquillo.

==== La Coca ====
This trail is a 1.8 miles one-way trail that is considered to be very challenging, not necessarily for its steepness but for the denseness of the forest foliage it crosses. The trail crosses numerous small steams, waterfalls and a tabonuco tree forest and leads to the lush Mameyes Wild &amp; Scenic River area. This is one of the rainiest parts of the national forest which means the trail is often muddy and slippery so appropriate hiking shoes are necessary. Due to the dense forest in the area, most disappearances in the forest occur along this trail so it is important not to walk off the trail under any circumstance. The trailhead is located on PR-191.

==== La Mina ====

La Mina Trail is closed as of 2021 due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.
La Mina Trail is a moderate to difficult 0.7-mile-long mile that starts on PR-191 close to the Palo Colorado Information Center. This is another popular hiking trail as it leads to La Mina Falls, one of the most picturesque waterfalls of the national forest. The trail also follows the course of La Mina River, also included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and offers opportunities for swimming in the pool located by La Mina Falls.

==== Big Tree ====
This is a paved mile-long self-guided interpretative trail that offers hikers the opportunity to come close to some of the largest trees in the national forest, the tabonuco tree (Dacryodes excelsa). Although paved the trail is considered moderate as it is steep in some sections. It ends in La Mina Falls close to a picnic area. The trail is closed as of 2021 due to the damage caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017.

==== Río Sabana ====
This trail is one of the few to be located in the municipality of Naguabo, in the southern portion of the national forest. The trailhead is located on the southern section of PR-191 and it hosts bathrooms and a picnic area. The trail was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and remained close for many decades but it was finally reopened in 2011 as part of the Sabana Recreation Area. This trail is considered difficult as it crosses dense forest and remote steep areas; it extends 2.2 miles and it connects to the El Toro and Tradewinds Trails in El Toro National Wilderness.

==== El Toro, Tradewinds ====
El Toro Wilderness Trail is one of the most remote and challenging trails in El Yunque National Forest. It extends for 2.9 miles on its paved section where it connects to the Río Sabana and the Tradewinds trails. When including the unpaved section (also known as the Tradewinds Trail), the trail extends for almost 5 miles and it leads to El Toro, which at 3,526 feet (1,075 m) is the highest point in both the national forest and eastern Puerto Rico. The trail crosses all four forest biomes through the municipalities of Canóvanas, Río Grande, Las Piedras (at El Toro&#x27;s summit) and Naguabo, fully within El Toro National Wilderness. This part of the national forest is the best ecologically preserved and it is home to numerous endemic and endangered species such as the Puerto Rican parrot, the Puerto Rican boa, the elfin woods warbler, the red fruit bat, and at least five species of coquis. The trailhead is located on PR-186 in a section of the road known as the El Toro Scenic Byway, in Cubuy, Canóvanas. Both the El Toro and Tradewinds trails are listed as National Recreation Trails.

=== Swimming ===
El Yunque National Forest offers many opportunities for swimming in natural pools often found at the base of waterfalls, such as that of La Mina Falls and the Juan Diego area off PR-191. Some areas available for swimming are the Quebrada Grande Recreation Area and the Espíritu Santo Observation Point off PR-186, the Sabana Recreation Area off the southern section of PR-191 in Naguabo, and the Angelito and Puente Roto Recreation Areas off PR-988 in Luquillo. Most of these areas are prone to flash flooding and as such they are often closed according to weather conditions.

Baño Grande and Baño de Oro are two former swimming pools and recreational areas popular between the 1930s and 1960s. These manmade pools were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the New Deal era by damming creeks belonging to the La Mina River watershed. They were closed due to a series of drownings and other safety issues. Although swimming is no longer possible at these pools, they are preserved as historic sites and have been listed in the National Register of Historic Places due to their historic and architectural value since 2017 and 2020, respectively. Baño de Oro now serves as a watershed garden and Baño Grande is now a popular scenic spot.

== El Portal Rainforest Center ==
Opened in 1996, the El Portal Rainforest Center was designed by Segundo Cardona, FAIA of Sierra Cardona Ferrer Architects to give visitors an introduction to what the rainforest looks like. 
Built on a 28,434-acre tropical forest, the Portal was built as a model headquarters for ecotourism and economic development and training, the center was built to educate those concerned about the wellbeing of the Caribbean National Forest and preserve the unique tropical forest heritage and environment. It is located within the national forest in the municipality of Río Grande.

A walkway set at above the ground allows for a view of the tops of trees, and another walkway winds along tree bases. Exhibits at the center focus on the plants and animals of the rainforest, the importance of rainforests around the world, and threats to rainforests and efforts to conserve them.

The entry experience begins atop an elevated walkway that unites the facility with the surrounding forest and provides views to the mountain peaks, ocean and reforested terrain. The Center contains 9,000 square feet of exhibits, an enclosed theater, conference center classrooms and laboratories, as well as administrative offices. To preserve natural conditions, care was taken to use existing openings for roads, parking areas and buildings while the arrival sequence and parking lots were designed with contours to save existing trees.

The Portal has survived several major hurricanes including Hurricane Georges. On September 21, 2017, Hurricane Maria on caused major damages to the center and renovations are underway as of 2020. El Portal Rainforest Center reopened to visitors in January 2022.

== Miscellaneous ==
El Yunque National Forest has been incorrectly called the only rainforest in the United States National Forest Service, but it is actually the only tropical rainforest. There are others that are temperate rainforests including some in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest.

In 2002, the U.S. Congress designated areas bounded by the Río Mameyes, Río de la Mina, and Río Icacos in the Caribbean National Forest as components of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

Contrary to the popular assumption, El Yunque Peak is not the highest mountain in either the Sierra de Luquillo or Puerto Rico. The highest mountain of the Sierra de Luquillo is El Toro, also located in the national forest, while the highest mountain in Puerto Rico is Cerro de Punta in the Cordillera Central on the border between Jayuya and Ponce.

El Yunque is also the object of Puerto Rican folklore and pop culture. Along with the coqui and the Puerto Rican parrot, El Yunque is considered a symbol of Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans. Along with the former two, it was chosen to be Puerto Rico&#x27;s entry in the America the Beautiful Quarters program. Puerto Rico&#x27;s only National Park Service site, San Juan National Historic Site had already been featured on the District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarters in 2009.

<doc id="452848" wikidata="Q750656" url="?curid=452848" title="Hypermarket">
<text>A hypermarket or superstore is a big-box store combining a supermarket and a department store. The result is an expansive retail facility carrying a wide range of products under one roof, including full grocery lines and general merchandise. In theory, hypermarkets allow customers to satisfy all their routine shopping needs in one trip. The term &quot;hypermarket&quot; () was coined in 1968 by French trade expert Jacques Pictet.

Hypermarkets, like other big-box stores, typically have business models focusing on high-volume, low-margin sales. Typically covering an area of , they generally have more than 200,000 different brands of merchandise available at any one time. Because of their large footprints, many hypermarkets choose suburban or out-of-town locations that are easily accessible by automobile.

==History==
===Canada===
Loblaws established its Real Canadian Superstore chain in 1979. It sells mainly groceries, while also retailing clothing, electronics and housewares. Its largest competitor in Canada is Walmart. These are the two major Canadian hypermarkets.

===Europe===
The Belgian retailer Grand Bazar opened three hypermarkets in a short span in 1961 under the name &quot;SuperBazar&quot; after Belgian law restricting the size of department stores was abolished in January 1961. The first &quot;SuperBazar&quot;, opened in Bruges on , initially designed to become a non-food department store, however only covered a surface area of , and was later converted into a regular supermarket. The substantially larger store that opened a week later in Auderghem, Brussels, covering , is regarded as a more proper hypermarket that brought the concept to fruition. It was Belgian market development engineer , who adopted the concept from his frequent trips to the United States, particularly inspired from the Grand Union&#x27;s &quot;Grand Way&quot; center in Paramus, New Jersey.

Carrefour opened its first hypermarket in 1963, at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois, France, The co-founders were influenced by the teachings of Colombian-born American marketing executive Bernardo Trujillo, who taught executive education as part of the NCR Corporation&#x27;s marketing campaign.

In France, hypermarkets are generally situated in shopping centers () outside cities, though some are present in the city center. They are surrounded by extensive car parking facilities, and generally by other specialized superstores that sell clothing, sports gear, automotive items, etc.

After the successes of super- and hyper-markets and amid fears that smaller stores would be forced out of business, France enacted laws that made it more difficult to build hypermarkets and also restricted the amount of economic leverage that hypermarket chains can impose upon their suppliers (the &quot;Loi Galland&quot;).

===Japan===
The predecessor to Ito-Yokado was founded in 1920 selling western goods, went public in 1957, and switched to that name in 1965. Seibu Department Stores was founded in 1956, and opened up its grocery chain Seiyu Group in 1963. Isao Nakauchi founded the first Daiei in Kobe in 1957, selling clothing, electronics, furniture and groceries all in one store. Jusco was created in 1970, and eventually became known as ÆON.

In Japanese, hypermarkets are known as 総合スーパー (Sougou Suupaa, General Merchandise Stores). There is a distinction in Japanese between スーパー (Supers) and デパート (Departs) with the former being discounters, but the latter selling luxury brand clothing and quite often high-end groceries as well.

Hypermarkets may be found in urban areas as well as less populated areas. The Japanese government encourages hypermarket installations, as mutual investment by financial stocks are a common way to run hypermarkets. Japanese hypermarkets may contain restaurants, manga (Japanese comic) stands, Internet cafés, typical department store merchandise, a full range of groceries, beauty salons and other services all in the same store. A recent trend has been to combine the dollar store concept with the hypermarket blueprint, giving rise to the &quot;hyakkin plaza&quot;—&quot;hyakkin&quot; (百均) or &quot;hyaku en&quot; (百円) means 100 yen (roughly 1 U.S. dollar).

===United States===

Until the 1980s, large stores combining food and non-food items were unusual in the United States, although early predecessors existed since the first half of the 20th century. The term &quot;hypermarket&quot; itself is still rarely used in the US.

The Pacific Northwest chain Fred Meyer, now a division of the Kroger supermarket company, opened the first suburban one-stop shopping center in 1931 in the Hollywood District of Portland, Oregon. The store&#x27;s innovations included a grocery store alongside a drugstore plus off-street parking and an automobile lubrication and oil service. In 1933, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s wear was added, and automotive department, housewares, and other non-food products followed in succeeding years. In the mid-1930s, Fred Meyer opened a central bakery, a candy kitchen, an ice cream plant, and a photo-finishing plant, which supplied the company&#x27;s stores in Portland and neighbouring cities with house brands such as Vita Bee bread, Hocus Pocus desserts, and Fifth Avenue candies. By the 1950s, Fred Meyer began opening stores that were , and the 1960s saw the first modern-sized Fred Meyer hypermarkets.

The Midwest (then grocery) chain Meijer, which today operates about 235 stores in six U.S. states, coined the term &quot;super center&quot;, and opened the first of its hypermarket format store in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in June 1961, under the brand name &quot;Thrifty Acres&quot;.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the three major U.S. discount store chains – Walmart, Kmart and Target – started developing similar format chains. Wal-Mart (as it was known before its late-2000s rebranding as Walmart) introduced Hypermart USA in 1987, followed by Wal-Mart Supercenter in 1988; The same year, French chains Carrefour and Auchan opened hypermarkets in Philadelphia and Greater Houston, respectively. Kmart opened its first Super Kmart Center in 1991; and Target came with the first Target Greatland stores in 1990, followed by the larger SuperTarget stores in 1995. Most Greatland stores have since been converted to SuperTarget stores, while some have been converted into regular Target stores with the exception of 2 entrances (one example of this is the Antioch, California location which opened in 2004).

In the early 1990s, U.S. hypermarkets also began selling fuel. The idea was first introduced in the 1960s, when a number of supermarket chains and retailers like Sears tried to sell fuel, but it didn&#x27;t generate sufficient consumer interest at the time. Today, there are approximately 4,500 hypermarket stores in the U.S. selling fuel, representing an estimated sold each year.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, hypermarkets were at their peak during the 1980s. This was especially prevalent during the era of South African owned Pick n Pay Stores and a now discontinued format of Kmart Australia stores known as Super Kmart. This trend in the Australian market soon lost its appeal into the 1990s. Super Kmart stores were discontinued and Coles Supermarkets and Kmart Stores opened in the former location. Pick n Pay continued to operate in Australia until the 2000s when their locations at Aspley and Sunnybank Hills were converted into Coles Supermarkets and Kmart Department Stores. 

As of 2022, the only hypermarket or Big-Box Store operational in Australia are Costco Wholesale Warehouses with currently sixteen stores in Australia – five stores in Melbourne, three stores in Sydney, two stores in Brisbane, two stores in Perth and one store each in Newcastle, Canberra, Adelaide and Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast. There were plans for German hypermarket company Kaufland to open stores in Australia announced in 2019; these plans were cancelled in 2020.

=== Iran ===
Hypermarkets did not exist in Iran until 2009 (1388 ه.ش.). Before that, there were some local hypermarkets, but international branches were nonexistent. Despite their late arrival, hypermarkets in Iran have achieved a significant degree of growth. The first branch was opened in Tehran under the name of Iran Hyperstar through a collaboration between Carrefour and Majid Al Futtaim Group based in the United Arab Emirates. The Emirati holding is the main shareholder with about 75% of the company&#x27;s shares. New branches were established after Iran Hyperstar’s first store found relative success. Now, other branches have been established in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz, Mashhad, Ahvaz, etc.

==Size==

The average Walmart Supercenter covers around , with the largest ones covering . A typical Carrefour hypermarket still covers , while the European trend in the 2000s has rather turned towards smaller hypermarkets of . In France, INSEE defines hypermarkets () as non-specialized markets with a minimum size of .

==Future==
Despite its success, the hypermarket business model may be under threat from online shopping and the shift towards customization according to analysts like Sanjeev Sanyal, Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Global Strategist, until 2015. Sanyal has argued that some developing countries such as India may omit the hypermarket stage and directly go online.

==Warehouse club==
Another category of stores sometimes included in the hypermarket category are the membership-based wholesale warehouse clubs that are popular in North America, pioneered by Fedco and today including Sam&#x27;s Club, a division of Walmart; Costco, in which Carrefour owned some shares from 1985 to 1996; BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club on the East Coast; and Clubes City Club in Mexico. In Europe, Makro (owned by Metro AG) leads the market.

However, warehouse clubs differ from hypermarkets in that they have sparse interior decor and require paid membership. In addition, warehouse clubs usually sell bigger packages and have fewer choices in each category of items.

<text>The Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum is located in Wausau, Wisconsin. It is best known for its annual &quot;Birds in Art&quot; exhibition, which exhibits contemporary artistic representations of birds. The annual exhibition has been held beginning the week after Labor Day since the museum&#x27;s founding in 1976. The museum stands on a estate in a 1931 English Tudor style house previously owned by Alice Woodson Forester and John E. Forester. The Foresters donated their home in 1973 and the museum opened in September 1976.

<text>The 24th Division was an infantry division of the British Army, raised in September 1914 from men volunteering for Lord Kitchener&#x27;s New Armies during the First World War. After almost a year spent training in England the division was sent to the Western Front between August and September 1915. It served in Belgium and France in the trenches of the Western Front for the duration of the war.

<doc id="452856" wikidata="Q2449543" url="?curid=452856" title="Ragdoll Productions">
<text>Ragdoll Productions Limited, or simply Ragdoll, is a British television production company founded in 1984 by Anne Wood, who had previously worked for Yorkshire Television and TV-am. It is located in Bloxham, Oxfordshire, and has produced a number of children&#x27;s programmes, most notably &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, &quot;Pob&#x27;s Programme&quot;, &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;, &quot;Brum&quot;, &quot;Boohbah&quot;, &quot;Tots TV&quot;, and &quot;In the Night Garden...,&quot; most of which are now owned by WildBrain.

==History==
Ragdoll Productions was founded on 26 July 1984 by Anne Wood, who produced shows for the ITV network. It was incorporated as Ragdoll Productions (U.K.) Limited in April 1985 and was originally based in Birmingham. The company&#x27;s first show, &quot;Pob&#x27;s Programme&quot;, premiered on Channel 4 later that year. The company was later commissioned by Central Independent Television to produce &quot;Playbox&quot;, which demonstrated the ability for the company to produce their own characters. In 1989, &quot;The Magic Mirror&quot; and &quot;BOOM!&quot; marked the company&#x27;s debut in the animation and live-action markets. The company at first produced puppet-based programmes, and their mascot was originally a female rag doll that was based on one that belonged to Wood&#x27;s daughter.

In 1992, the company moved their operations to Stratford-upon-Avon and opened up The Ragdoll Shop.

In the mid-1990s, Ragdoll expanded operations to the United States, and signed a deal with The Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Company to sell their programmes in the market.

In 2000, Ragdoll dropped their rag doll mascot for a more simplistic logo designed by Lambie-Nairn, with the company also adopting a new name of Ragdoll Limited by that point. During that time, the company started to move away from puppet-based shows (which started with &quot;Teletubbies&quot; in 1997), by making animated cartoons. Ragdoll still produced live-action shows, but would use costumes and animatronics instead of puppets.

In October 2001, Ragdoll parted ways with Itsy Bitsy following a failure to reach an agreement with the company&#x27;s majority owner, the Handleman Group. Ragdoll then started to sell their programmes on their own from then-on, forming Ragdoll USA.

In January 2002, &quot;Teletubbies: Everywhere&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, was announced to air on CBeebies within its launch window. On 14 June, a new series titled &quot;Boohbah&quot; was announced and was pre-sold to CITV and GMTV for a 2003 delivery. The show later saw an international roll-out.

At MIPTV 2005, Ragdoll announced a new series titled &quot;Blurrfect&quot; and that CITV had acquired broadcasting rights for an autumn 2005 delivery. By September 2005, the series was renamed &quot;Blips&quot;, and soon premiered on 29 September 2005 as part of the CITV&#x27;s autumn schedule. On 13 October, Ragdoll unrevealed two new series that were pre-sold to the BBC: &quot;In the Night Garden...&quot; and &quot;Tronji&quot;, for a 2007 delivery. In October 2005, Ragdoll subsidiary The Ragdoll Foundation announced that Five&#x27;s Milkshake! block had commissioned a series of six short films titled &quot;What Makes Me Happy?&quot;, which would air daily from 19 December.

In September 2006, Ragdoll formed a joint venture with BBC Worldwide called Ragdoll Worldwide, to sell and license the company&#x27;s programmes outside of the UK and North America. &quot;In the Night Garden...&quot; and &quot;Tronji&quot; would be the first two programmes created as part of the venture, while existing programmes were handled by BBC Worldwide, which managed the international broadcast sales and the UK and international licensing of all Ragdoll properties (including &quot;Blips&quot;, &quot;Boohbah&quot;, &quot;Brum&quot;, &quot;Tots TV&quot;, &quot;Rosie and Jim&quot;, and &quot;Open a Door&quot;), with Ragdoll retaining all British broadcast rights. A new subsidiary, Ragdoll USA Inc., part of the new joint venture, would manage Ragdoll&#x27;s distribution in North America.

In January 2013, Ragdoll opted to end their agreement with BBC Worldwide and put up Ragdoll Worldwide for sale. On 16 September, Canadian studio DHX Media (currently named WildBrain) purchased the venture from both companies for £17.4 million (or USD$24 million) The deal included the rights to most of Ragdoll&#x27;s programming produced from 1990 to 2012. The company also changed to its current name of Ragdoll Productions Limited, with &quot;Productions&quot; added back to the name after 13 years.

In 2015, Ragdoll produced the live-action/stop-motion series &quot;Twirlywoos&quot; with DHX, making it the first and only co-production between the companies.

In 2018, the company co-produced a short film with Disney UK for the Hope Works initiative, titled &quot;What Shall We Do With The Angry Monster?&quot;.

In 2021, Ragdoll formed a deal with British distribution company Cake Entertainment for them to distribute their new series, &quot;B.O.T. and the Beasties&quot;, for CBeebies. On 29 March, the company was relocated to Shenington, with Anne Wood retiring from the company on 14 December, and leaving her son Christopher as director of the studio.

On 13 June 2024, Ragdoll would once again move their operations, this time to Bloxham, another small town in Oxfordshire.

== Pre-Ragdoll productions ==
The following are some of productions made by Anne Wood before Ragdoll was founded, accompanied by a brief description and vital statistics:

* &quot;Puzzle Party&quot; - first broadcast in 1977. Hosted by Gyles Brandreth and featuring characters Gnigel and Gnu, the show was one of Anne Wood&#x27;s earliest TV shows for the BBC.
* &quot;The Book Tower&quot; - first broadcast in 1979, hosted by Tom Baker and Stephen Moore.
* &quot;Ragdolly Anna&quot; - first broadcast in 1982, based on the children&#x27;s books by Jean Kenward.
* &quot;Roland Rat&quot; - first broadcast in 1983.

Productions 1984-today
Ragdoll&#x27;s programmes produced between 1990 and 2017 (excluding &quot;Pob&#x27;s Programme&quot;, &quot;BOOM!&quot; and &quot;Storytime&quot;) are currently owned by WildBrain (formerly known as DHX Media), the company no longer owns the rights of any of their shows.

== The Ragdoll Shop ==
The Ragdoll Shop in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, was a shop that consisted of themed play areas based on Ragdoll properties and an area where merchandise was sold. The shop first opened in 1992, and traded until 2005, because of expansion limits and failure to find a new larger venue.

The building that formerly housed the shop is now a optometrist&#x27;s practice named Dr. CP Grey&#x27;s. The picture of Rosie and Jim waving can still be seen in the black window at the top of the building.

<doc id="452859" wikidata="Q3010657" url="?curid=452859" title="Le Griffon">
<text>Le Griffon (, &quot;The Griffin&quot;) was a sailing vessel built by French explorer and fur trader René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in the Niagara area of New York in 1679.

&quot;Le Griffon&quot; was constructed and launched at or near Cayuga Island on the Niagara River and was armed with seven cannons. The exact size and construction of Le Griffon is not known but many researchers believe she was a 45-ton barque. She was the largest sailing vessel on the Great Lakes up to that time. La Salle and Father Louis Hennepin set out on &quot;Le Griffon&quot;″s maiden voyage on 7 August 1679 with a crew of 32, sailing across Lake Erie, Lake Huron and Lake Michigan through uncharted waters that only canoes had previously explored. The ship landed on an island in northern Lake Michigan adjacent to Green Bay where the local tribes had gathered with animal pelts to trade with the French. La Salle and company disembarked and on 18 September sent the ship back toward Niagara. On its return trip from the island, it vanished with all six crew members and its load of furs.

One consequential result of the effort to build Le Griffin was the discovery of Niagara Falls on the namesake river between lakes Erie and Ontario.

While there have been many theories over the years, there is no clear consensus as to the fate or current location of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;.

==Design==

&quot;Le Griffon&quot;″s pattern closely followed the prevailing type used by explorers to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the New World. The exact size and construction of &quot;Le Griffon&quot; is not known. The widely referenced antique woodcutting of &quot;Le Griffon&quot; shows her with two masts but many researchers believe she was a 45-ton barque with a single mast with several square sails and long with a beam.

Hennepin&#x27;s first account says she was a vessel of about 45 tons; his second says 60 tons. Because his second account has numerous exaggerations and cases where he credits himself for things that La Salle had done, Hennepin&#x27;s first account is considered more reliable. In any case, &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was larger than any other vessel on the lakes at the time, and as far as contemporary reports can confirm, the first named vessel.

She had the figure of a griffin mounted on her jib-boom and an eagle flying above. 
Some say &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was named for Count Frontenac whose coat of arms was ornamented with the mythical griffin. Hennepin said she was named to protect her from the fire that threatened her.

==Historical context==
&quot;Le Griffon&quot; was the largest fixed-rig sailing vessel on the Great Lakes up to that time. Historian J. B. Mansfield reported that this &quot;excited the deepest emotions of the Indian tribes, then occupying the shores of these inland waters&quot;.

La Salle, sought a Northwest Passage to China and Japan to extend France&#x27;s trade. Creating a fur trade monopoly with the Native Americans would finance his quest and building &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was an &quot;essential link in the scheme&quot;.

The sailing of Le Griffin from the temporary outpost just south of Niagara Falls on the upper Niagara River to Green Bay was part of La Salle&#x27;s 2nd of four expeditions which ended at the mouth of the Illinois River on the Mississippi. His first expedition in 1669 had aborted somewhere south of Lake Ontario. His third expedition in 1682 retraced the second, then traversed the middle and lower Mississippi River to its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico. His last expedition in 1684 starting from France explored an area on the Gulf coast in eastern Texas where he perished attempting to establish a French colony at the mouth of the Mississippi.

After Le Griffin, it would be more than 80 years before another sailing ship plied the Great Lakes and enabled the commercial exploitation of the lakes and facilitated settlement of the American west.

== First ships and preparations ==
&quot;Le Griffon&quot; may or may not be considered the first ship on the Great Lakes, depending on what factors one deems necessary to qualify a vessel for that designation. Decking, permanent masts, and bearing a name are a few of the criteria one might use.

Before 1673, the most common vessel on the lakes was the canoe. While smaller canoes were used on rivers and streams, lake canoes were more commonly larger vessels measuring up to about long. While some of these were made from a single carved log (&quot;dugout&quot; or &quot;pirogue&quot;), most were bark canoes. Bateaux were also common. They were open vessels (no deck) made of wood measuring up to about long and capable of carrying three or four tons of cargo. While they were at times fitted with mast and sails, their primary propulsion was either oars or poles. The sails were merely supplemental for traveling down wind. Their inefficiency at beating to windward made them impractical as sailing vessels, and they were not very safe in open water.

===Below Niagara Falls: first ships on Lake Ontario===
James Mansfield says that in the fall of 1678, La Salle built a vessel of about 10 tons burden at Fort Frontenac and that this vessel, named &quot;Frontenac&quot;, was the first real sailing vessel on the Great Lakes; specifically, on Lake Ontario (which some at the time called &quot;Lac de Frontenac&quot;). Many authors since Mansfield have followed suit. There is reason, however, to question his assertion.

Justin Windsor notes that Count Frontenac by 1 August 1673, &quot;had already ordered the construction of a vessel on Ontario to be used as an auxiliary force to Fort Frontenac.&quot; He also says that at Fort Frontenac in 1676, La Salle &quot;laid the keels of the vessels which he depended on to frighten the English.&quot; J. C. Mills quotes a letter from La Salle to the Minister of Marine that says, &quot;The fort at Cataraqui (Fort Frontenac) with the aid of a vessel now building, will command Lake Ontario...&quot; While no date is given for the letter, the location of Mill&#x27;s reference to it suggests that it was sent before 1677, perhaps as early as 1675. Francis Parkman says that by 1677, &quot;four vessels of 25 to 40 tons had been built for the lake Ontario and the river St. Lawrence.&quot; H. W. Beckwith says that in September 1678, La Salle &quot;already had three small vessels on Lake Ontario, which he had made use of in a coasting trade with the Indians.&quot; None of these sources ascribe a name to any of these vessels. While the journals of Tonti, Hennepin, and LeClercq (participants with La Salle) do mention a little vessel of 10 tons, none of them apply a name to it.

La Salle&#x27;s prime focus in 1678 was building &quot;Le Griffon&quot;. Arriving at Fort Frontenac in late September, he had neither the time for nor the interest in building a vessel at Fort Frontenac to transport building materials, some of which he had recently obtained in France, to a site above Niagara Falls where he could build his new ship. Beckwith&#x27;s conclusion was that he chose one of his existing vessels, one of about ten tons burden, for sending the first group of men to Niagara. Some of La Salle&#x27;s associates called this vessel a brigantine; others called it a bark. The accounts agree that this little vessel played a part in the building of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;.

==&quot;Le Griffon&quot;==
===Expedition to upper Niagara===
On 18 November 1678, after just over a month of preparations at Fort Frontenac, La Salle dispatched Captain La Motte and Father Louis Hennepin together with 15 men and supplies in a vessel of 10 tons. Their mission was to begin selecting a site for the construction of &quot;Le Griffon&quot; and to erect necessary structures for shelter, storage, and defense. Because the wind was strong from the north, they sailed close to the north shore of the lake, putting in for the nights in various bays along the way. Somewhere near present-day Toronto they were frozen in and had to chop their way out of the ice. From there they struck out across the lake toward the mouth of the Niagara River. They arrived late on 5 December, but the weather was rough and they did not want to run the surf and outflow of the river at night, so they stayed a few miles off shore. On 6 December, they landed safely on the east bank of the river at about where Lewiston, New York is today. They attempted to sail further upstream, but the current was too strong. Ice flowing down the river threatened to damage their little brigantine and after a cable was broken, they hauled the vessel ashore and into a small ravine for protection.

La Salle&#x27;s men first had to build their lodging and then guard against the Iroquois who were hostile to this invasion of their ancient homeland. La Salle had instructed Hennepin and La Motte to go into wilderness in knee-deep snow on an embassy to the great village of the Seneca tribe, bringing gifts and promises in order to obtain their good will to build &quot;the big canoe&quot; but many tribal members did not approve. Beginning on Christmas Day, 1678, La Motte and Hennepin together with four of their men, went by snowshoe to a prominent Seneca chief who resided at Tagarondies a village about east of Niagara and about south of Lake Ontario. They wished to secure a reliable truce lest the natives interfere with their projects. Negotiations with the Senecas were only moderately successful, so when they left the village they still wondered if the natives would permit them to finish their project. They reached Niagara again on 14 January.

Meanwhile, La Salle and Henri de Tonti, had departed Fort Frontenac in a second vessel some days after La Motte and Hennepin. This was a &quot;great bark&quot; (Hennepin&#x27;s words) of about 20 tons burden – although Tonti&#x27;s journal says this was a 40-ton vessel. The vessel carried anchors, chain, guns, cordage, and cable for &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, as well as supplies and provisions for the anticipated journey. La Salle followed the southern shore of the lake. La Salle decided to visit the Senecas at Tagarondies himself. He put ashore near present-day Rochester, New York, and arrived at Tagarondies very shortly after La Motte and Hennepin had left. He was more successful in securing the Indians&#x27; tolerance of his proposed &quot;big canoe&quot; and support buildings. With La Salle back aboard their vessel, the company again sailed west until, about from Niagara, weather checked their progress. There was some disagreement between La Salle and the ship&#x27;s pilot, and La Salle and Tonti went ahead on foot to Niagara. When they arrived there La Motte and Hennepin had not yet returned. While there La Salle selected a site for building &quot;Le Griffon&quot;. The site La Salle had selected for building &quot;Le Griffon&quot; has conclusively been identified as at or near the mouth of Cayuga Creek, at Cayuga Island. 

After La Salle and Tonti left, the pilot and the rest of the crew were to follow with the supply vessel. On 8 January 1679, the pilot and crew decided to spend the night ashore where they could light a fire and sleep in some warmth. It was a calm night and they believed the vessel was securely moored. When a strong wind suddenly arose, they could not make it back to the ship. The vessel dragged its anchor for about nine miles to the east before grounding and breaking up near present-day Thirty Mile Point. When La Salle heard of the loss (through a messenger or one of the natives), he left Niagara and joined in the salvage effort. They recovered the anchors, chain, and most of the materials critical for &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, but most of the supplies and provisions were lost. They dragged the materials to the mouth of the Niagara, rested and warmed up a few days in an Indian village, then carried the materials single file through the snow to their settlement above the falls.

===Building Le Griffin===
The keel was laid on 26 January 1679. La Salle offered Hennepin the honor of driving the first spike, but Hennepin deferred to his leader. Having lost needed supplies, La Salle left the building of &quot;Le Griffon&quot; under Tonti&#x27;s care, and set out on foot to return to Fort Frontenac. While frozen rivers made traveling easy, finding food was not. He arrived there nearly starved only to find that his detractors had succeeded in stirring up doubt and opposition with his creditors. Addressing his problems long delayed his return to the expedition.

After La Salle&#x27;s departure, Tonti refloated the little brigantine, and attempted to use it for more salvage work at the wreck, but the winter weather prevented success. He then charged La Motte with salvage by use of canoes.

Progress on &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was fraught with problems. Crude tools, green and wet timbers, and the cold winter months caused slow progress in the construction of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;. Suffering from cold and low on supplies, the men were close to mutiny.

While work continued on &quot;Le Griffon&quot; in the spring of 1679, as soon as the ice began to break up along the shores of Lake Erie, La Salle sent out men from Fort Frontenac in 15 canoes laden with supplies and merchandise to trade with the Illinois for furs at the trading posts of the upper Huron and Michigan Lakes. The uneasy truce with the Indians was tested by threats and attempts of sabotage and murder. Tonti learned of a plan to burn the ship before it could be launched, so he launched ahead of schedule and &quot;Le Griffon&quot; entered the waters in early May 1679.

A female Native informant who was of the tribe foiled the plans of hostile Senecas to burn &quot;Le Griffon&quot; as she grew on her stocks. The unrest of the Seneca and dissatisfied workmen were continually incited by secret agents of merchants and traders who feared La Salle would break their monopoly on the fur trade. When the Seneca again threatened to burn the ship, she was launched earlier than planned in Cayuga Creek channel of the upper Niagara River with ceremony and the roar of her cannons. A party from the Iroquois tribe who witnessed the launching were so impressed by the &quot;large floating fort&quot; that they named the French builders &quot;Ot-kon&quot;, meaning &quot;penetrating minds&quot;, which corresponds to the Seneca word &quot;Ot-goh&quot;, meaning supernatural beings or spirits. The tumultuous sound of &quot;Le Griffon&#x27;s&quot; cannons so amazed the Native Americans that the Frenchmen were able to sleep at ease for the first time in months when they anchored off shore. 
After &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was launched, she was rigged with sails and provisioned with seven cannon of which two were brass. The French flag flew above the cabin placed on top of the main deck that was elevated above the hull.

==Maiden voyage==

===Niagara River to Saginaw Bay===

In July 1679, La Salle directed 12 men to tow &quot;Le Griffon&quot; through the rapids of the Niagara River with long lines stretched from the bank. They moored in quiet water off Squaw Island three miles from Lake Erie waiting for favorable northeast winds. La Salle sent Tonti ahead on 22 July 1679 with a few selected men, canoes, and trading goods to secure furs and supplies. &quot;Le Griffon&quot; set off on 7 August with unfurled sails, a 34-man crew, and a salute from her cannon and musketry. They were navigating &quot;Le Griffon&quot; through uncharted waters that only canoes had previously explored. They made their way around Long Point, Ontario, constantly sounding as they went through the first moonless, fog-laden night to the sound of breaking waves and guided only by La Salle&#x27;s knowledge of Galinée&#x27;s crude, 10-year-old chart. They sailed across the open water of Lake Erie whose shores were forested and &quot;unbroken by the faintest signs of civilization&quot;. They reached the mouth of the Detroit River on 10 August 1679 where they were greeted by three columns of smoke signaling the location of Tonti&#x27;s camp whom they received on board. They entered Lake St. Clair on 12 August, the feast day of Saint Clare of Assisi, and named the lake after her. They again sounded their way through the narrow channel of the St. Clair River to its mouth where they were delayed by contrary winds until 24 August. For the second time, they used a dozen men and ropes to tow &quot;Le Griffon&quot; over the rapids of the St. Clair River into lower Lake Huron. They made their way north and west to Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron where they were becalmed until noon of 25 August. La Salle took personal command at this point due to evidence that the pilot was negligent.

===Lake Huron storm===

On noon of 25 August they started out northwest with a favoring northerly wind. When the wind suddenly veered to the southeast they changed course to avoid Presque Isle. However, the ferocity of the gale forced them to retreat windward and lie-to until morning. By 26 August the violence of the gale caused them to &quot;haul down their topmasts, to lash their yards to the deck, and drift at the mercy of storm. At noon the waves ran so high, and the lake became so rough, as to compel them to stand in for land.&quot; 
Father Hennepin wrote that during the fearful crisis of the storm, La Salle vowed that if God would deliver them, the first chapel erected in Louisiana would be dedicated to the memory of Saint Anthony of Padua, the patron of the sailor. The wind did slightly decrease but they drifted slowly all night, unable to find anchorage or shelter. They were driven northwesterly until the evening of 27 August when under a light southerly breeze they finally rounded Bois Blanc Island and anchored in the calm waters of the natural harbor at East Moran Bay off the settlement of Mission St. Ignace, where there was a settlement of Hurons, Ottawas, and a few Frenchmen.

===St. Ignace===

Upon &quot;Le Griffon&quot;″s safe arrival at St. Ignace, the voyagers fired a salute from her deck that the Hurons on shore volleyed three times with their firearms. More than 100 Native American bark canoes gathered around &quot;Le Griffon&quot; to look at the &quot;big wood canoe&quot;. La Salle dressed in a scarlet cloak bordered with lace and a highly plumed cap, laid aside his arms in charge of a sentinel and attended mass with his crew in the chapel of the Ottawas and then made a visit of ceremony with the chiefs.

La Salle found some of the 15 men he sent ahead from Fort Frontenac to trade with the Illinois but they had listened to La Salle&#x27;s enemies who said he would never reach the Straits of Mackinac. La Salle seized two of the deserters and sent Tonti with six men to arrest two more at Sault Ste. Marie.

===Green Bay===

The short open-water season of the upper Great Lakes compelled La Salle to depart for Green Bay on 12 September, five days before Tonti&#x27;s return. They sailed from the Straits of Mackinac to Washington Island located at the entrance of Green Bay. They anchored on the south shore of the island and found it occupied by friendly Pottawatomies and 15 of the fur traders La Salle sent ahead. The traders had collected of furs in anticipation of the arrival of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;. La Salle gave instructions for &quot;Le Griffon&quot; to off-load merchandise for him at Mackinac that would be picked up on the return trip. La Salle stayed behind with four canoes to explore the head of Lake Michigan. &quot;Le Griffon&quot; rode out a violent storm for four days and then on 18 September, the pilot Luc and five crew sailed under a favorable wind for the Niagara River with a parting salute from a single gun. She carried a cargo of furs valued at from 50,000 to 60,000 francs ($10,000 – $12,000) and the rigging and anchors for another vessel that La Salle intended to build to find passage to the West Indies. La Salle never saw &quot;Le Griffon&quot; again.

==The fate of Le Griffon==
There are three accounts from among La Salle&#x27;s party regarding the fate of Le Griffon: Father Hennepin&#x27;s, La Salle&#x27;s own, and that of Henri Tonti. Hennepin said: &quot;They sailed the 18th of September with a Westerly Wind, and fir&#x27;d a Gun to take their leave. Tho&#x27; the Wind was favorable, it was never known what course they steer&#x27;d nor how they perish&#x27;d... the Ship was hardly a league from the Coast, when it was toss&#x27;d up by a violent Storm in such a manner, that our Men were never heard of since; and it is suppos&#x27;d that the Ship struck upon a Sand, and was there bury&#x27;d.&quot;

La Salle&#x27;s account was as follows: &quot;The barque having anchored at the north of the Lac des Illinois, the pilot, against the opinion of some savages who assured him that there was a great storm in the middle of the lake, wanted to continue his voyage without considering that the sheltered location where he was prevented him from knowing the strength of the wind. He was barely a quarter of a league from the shore when the savages saw the barque tossed in a manner so extraordinary that, unable to resist the storm even though all of the sails were lowered, a short time later they lost her from sight, and they believed that she was pushed against the shoals that are near the Isles Huronnes, where she was buried.&quot;

The above is based on Abbe Bernou&#x27;s rendition. La Salle&#x27;s original letter, which survives, says:
&quot;The savages, named Pottawatomies, told me that two days after his departure from the island where I had left him, the 18th of September 1679, this blast of wind of which I have told you being raised, the pilot who was with them moored at the north coast where they were lodged, believing the wind favorable for going to Missilimakinac, as, in effect, it was on the beam, and not feeling the violence of it because of the closeness of the land over which it came, set sail against their advice, they having assured him that there was a great storm out in the lake where the lake appeared completely white; but the pilot ignoring them, replied that his ship had no fear of the wind, set sail, and the wind that was blowing increasing greatly, they noticed that he was obliged to furl all of his sails, with the exception of the two large ones, and that, however, the barque did not do more than traverse towards the islands offshore, bars of large sandbanks which extend more than two leagues offshore.&quot;

But in another of La Salle&#x27;s letters, of which only a fragment survives, continues the narrative, via a Native boy, who was given to La Salle as a slave:
&quot;He has seen the pilot of the barque that was lost in the lac des Illinois and one of the sailors, which he described to me with details so particular that I cannot doubt it, who were taken with their four comrades in the river Mississippi, while going up toward the Nadouessiou in bark canoes; that the four others were killed and eaten, this the pilot avoided by detonating one of the grenades that they had stolen from the barque and making them understand that if life were given to him and his comrade, he would destroy with similar ones the villages of the enemies of those who had captured them. These savages brought, the following spring, the Frenchmen to the village of the Missourites, where they went to treat for peace, and the pilot detonated, at their request, a grenade, in the presence of this young Pana who was there at the time. These rogues must have taken the plan, counseled by my enemies, to sink the barque and go by the Mississippi to join du Luth, who was among the Nadouessiou, after having taken the best of the merchandise which were inside to exchange for beaver and to withdraw to the baye du Nord, among the English, if their affairs went badly. This is all the more probable as the man named La Rivière, de Tours, who deserted me to follow du Luth, was in the barque, where I had left him after having recaptured him. They could not have taken this route without having passed the house of the Jesuits of the Bay, who have always acted ignorant of it...&quot;. 

Tonti merely says, &quot;As for the boat, it was never heard from again.&quot;

After these, history becomes legend. Charlevoix, the early chronicler of the Jesuits (who was not present at these events), says: &quot;No very authentic tidings were had of it after it left the bay. Some have reported that the Indians no sooner perceived this large vessel sailing over their lakes, than they gave themselves up for lost, unless they could succeed in disgusting the French with this mode of navigating; that the Iroquois in particular, already preparing for a rupture with us, seized this opportunity to spread distrust of us among the Algonquin nations; that they succeeded, especially with the Ottawas, and that a troop of these last, seeing the Griffin at anchor in a bay, ran up under pretext of seeing a thing so novel to them; that, as no one distrusted them, they were allowed to go aboard, where there were only five men, who were massacred by these savages; that the murderers carried off all the cargo of the vessel, and then set it on fire. But how could all these details be known when we are moreover assured that no Ottawa ever mentioned it.&quot; Charlevoix does not say who the reporters could have been.
In his biography of La Salle first published in 1869, Parkman, who at that time may have been in possession of unpublished material acquired indirectly via Pierre Margry, wrote in a footnote that became a focus of writers and historians that followed, concerning a letter written by La Salle to the governor of New France in 1683. In the letter &quot;La Salle expresses his belief that his vessel, the ‘Griffin,’ had been destroyed, not by Indians, but by the pilot, who, as he thinks, had been induced to sink her, and then, with some of the crew, attempted to join Du Lhut with their plunder, but were captured by Indians on the Mississippi.” Hennepin and Parkman are the sources of all accounts of La Salle and Le Griffen from that time forward. 

There is no conclusive evidence about any of the theories about &quot;Le Griffon&quot;″s loss.

==Searches and shipwrecks==
&quot;Le Griffon&quot; is considered by some to have been the first ship lost on the Great Lakes. It was another vessel used by La Salle and Tonti, however, that was the first loss on 8 January 1679. It dragged anchor and ran aground near Thirty Mile Point on Lake Ontario, where it broke apart. Most sources do not ascribe a name to this vessel, and it was one of several La Salle used for fur trading below Niagara.

&quot;Le Griffon&quot; is reported to be the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of Great Lakes shipwreck hunters. A number of sunken old sailing ships have been suggested to be &quot;Le Griffon&quot; but, except for the ones proven to be other ships, there has been no positive identification. Of 22 claims of finding &quot;Le Griffin&quot; advanced since the 1800s, all but 2 have been definitively dismissed. One candidate was a wreck at the western end of Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, known since at least 1873, when a lighthouse was constructed at the western end of the island. Another candidate is a debris field adjacent to Poverty Island at the entrance to Green Bay discovered by private maritime company The Great Lakes Exploration Group In 2018.

In 2022, Wayne Lusardi, Michigan state marine archaeologist, stated bluntly, &quot;The Griffon has not been found.&quot;

===Mississagi Straits claim===
In 1873, a lighthouse was constructed near the southwest end of Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, manned by a resident keeper. A shipwreck was on the adjacent shore a mile north of the Mississagi lighthouse on Manitoulin Island. In 1887, four skeletons were discovered in a depression behind a boulder, and two more in another nearby limestone cave. They were wrapped in birchbark, and identified as Natives at that time. By coincidence, six was the number of sailors on Le Griffin. Found with the skeletons were a number of metal tokens reportedly with French markings, and a silver watch later dated to the 17th century.
The possible remains of Le Griffon were found in 1898 by lighthouse keeper Albert Cullis, on a beach on the western edge of Manitoulin Island in northern Lake Huron. Results of testing some of the artifacts were disputed. According to one report the wreck had no centerboard; keel was an oak timber a foot square-it was fastened to two parallel timbers running fore and aft inside the ship. Fastenings were 36 inch iron bolts. At the turn of the bilge the hewed timbers which formed the bottom grooved for grounding keels. Bolts and spikes were crude workmanship cut from square bars and threads formed by forcing a nut into the bar and then finished by hand. The iron was a type smelted by wood as fuel in France during the 1600&#x27;s. Lead caulking was of a type used in French galiots of the period. A couple of lead cups like the end of a plunger for opening drains [tips of rams for loading cannons{?}]. An old indian told lighthouse keeper William Grant that the wreck had been there during the boyhood of his father in 1780s–1790s. The wreck had always been in the memories of the oldest inhabitants; earliest settlers had salvaged iron from the wreck for harrow teeth and used lead from its seams for bullets and fishing weights. Sometime before 1930 a fisherman whose tug was in Mississagi Straits pulling up his anchor found one fluke broken and the other had timbers of a wreck. In the 1930&#x27;s a Navy commander and a state archeologist saw the hand hewn timbers of the wreck; all that was left was a section of the bottom 15 by 30 feet remained. A 2021 book concludes that Le Griffin was indeed wrecked at Manitoulin Island

The skeletons, and most of the artifacts collected from the two caves and the wreck, long stored in the lighthouse, were lost in a series of very unfortunate accidents. The remains of the wreck on the shore were washed away in a storm in 1942. All that is left today is a few pieces of iron, wood and some lead caulking from the ship.

===Other claims===
In 2001 near Poverty Island, adjacent to Green Bay on Lake Michigan, a 10.5&#x27; pole sticking up out of the lakebed was discovered by private marine company Great Lakes Exploration Group, founded by Steve and Kathie Libert. After years of legal squabbles the Michigan Department of Natural Resources issued a permit, and on 16 June 2013, an underwater pit was dug allowing US and French archeologists to examine the object for the first time. They discovered a 15-inch slab of blackened wood that might have been a human-fashioned cultural artifact. On 19 June 2013, teams of archaeologists determined the wood pole whose full length was 19&#x27;, was not attached to a ship, and retrieved it from the lake. The archaeologists split, some concluding it was likely a bowsprit dating from a ship hundreds of years old, and others that it was a common pound net stake used for fishing nets in the 19th century. Later radio carbon dating was inconclusive, indicating it could have been fashioned between 1660 and 1950. During excavation of the pole, another nearby area was searched. Sonar showed an object approximately (similar to the dimensions of &quot;Le Griffon&quot;) located under several feet of sediment, but excavation found nothing further. It was later postulated that a shoal of mussels caused a false sonar reading.

In 2018, Great Lakes Exploration group, using satellite and aerial images, located a shipwreck and debris field 3.8 miles from the excavated site. In response to a request to excavate the wreck, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in an email, has dismissed the Liberts&#x27; claim, detailing thus: &quot;Our archeologist&#x27;s review of recently published media images reveals the remains of a shipwreck that features typical late 19th-century Great Lakes shipbuilding materials and methodologies, and scantlings that are entirely too large to be a French colonial vessel. The keelson structure with mast steps, paired floors and futtocks, and ceiling timbers all suggest a sailing craft, probably a schooner or schooner-barge, that was built and operated during the last half of the 1800s. Additionally, this particular shipwreck is well-known, can be clearly seen on aerial imagery internet sites, and has been visited by state authorities.&quot;

The most recent substantive claim to finding &quot;Le Griffon&quot; was 27 December 2014, when two divers, Kevin Dykstra and Frederick Monroe, announced the discovery of a wreck that they believed was &quot;Le Griffon&quot;, based on the bowstem, which to some resembles an ornamental griffin. Their claim was quickly debunked when Michigan authorities dove down on 9 June 2015 after receiving the coordinates to verify its authenticity. Michigan state maritime archaeologist Wayne R. Lusardi presented evidence that the wreck was, in fact, a tugboat due to its length and presence of a steam boiler.

<text>The provinces of Kenya were replaced by a system of counties in 2013, after the 2010 constitution was effected.

== History ==
Before the new constitution of Kenya that came into force on 27 August 2010, Kenya was divided into eight provinces (see map). The provinces, excluding Nairobi Province, were subdivided into 46 districts as at 1992, which were further subdivided into 262 divisions. The divisions were subdivided into 2,427 locations and 6,612 sublocations. A province was administered by a Provincial Commissioner. This division of these provinces was a result of the devolution that came into effect after the promulgation of the 2010 Constitution.

Kenyan local authorities generally do not follow common boundaries with divisions. They are classified as city, municipality, town or county councils.

A third discrete type of classification are electoral constituencies. They are electoral areas without administrative functions, and are further subdivided into wards.

<doc id="452884" wikidata="Q364219" url="?curid=452884" title="Sicco Mansholt">
<text>Sicco Leendert Mansholt (; 13 September 1908 – 29 June 1995) was a Dutch farmer, politician and diplomat of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) and later the Labour Party (PvdA), who served as the fourth president of the European Commission from 1 March 1972 until 5 January 1973.

Mansholt worked as a farmer in Wieringermeer from 1937 until 1945. In 1940, during World War II, he joined the Dutch resistance against the German occupiers and helped shelter refugees. Following the end of World War II, Mansholt was appointed as acting Mayor of Wieringermeer, serving from 30 April 1945 until 22 May 1945. After the end of the German occupation, Queen Wilhelmina ordered the formation of a Cabinet of National unity to serve as a caretaker government and make preparations for a new election, and Mansholt was appointed as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Supplies in the Cabinet Schermerhorn–Drees, taking office on 25 June 1945. Mansholt was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives after the election of 1946, taking office on 4 June 1946. He continued as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Supplies in the Cabinet Beel I, taking office on 3 July 1946, then served as acting Minister of Economic Affairs from 14 January 1948 until 20 January 1948 following the resignation of Gerardus Huysmans. After the election of 1948 Mansholt returned as a Member of the House of Representatives on 27 July 1948, and continued as Minister in the Cabinet Drees–Van Schaik, taking office on 7 August 1948. Mansholt served continuously as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Supplies in the Drees Cabinets I, II and III, and also served as a Member of the House of Representatives after the elections of 1952 and 1956, serving from 15 July 1952 until 7 September 1952 and from 3 July 1956 until 3 October 1956.

In December 1957, Mansholt was nominated as the first European Commissioner from the Netherlands in the First Hallstein Commission. Lardinois was given the portfolio of Agriculture and was appointed as the first Vice-President of the European Commission. He resigned as Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Supplies on 1 January 1958 and the First Hallstein Commission was installed on 7 January 1958. Mansholt continued to serve as European Commissioner for Agriculture and vice-president in the Second Hallstein Commission, the Rey Commission and the Malfatti Commission. In February 1972 Mansholt was nominated as the next President of the European Commission. The Mansholt Commission was installed on 1 March 1972 and oversaw the creation of the European Monetary System on 24 April 1972 and the first enlargement on 1 January 1973. The Mansholt Commission was succeeded by the Ortoli Commission on 5 January 1973.

After his retirement, Mansholt occupied numerous seats as a nonprofit director for supervisory boards for several international non-governmental organizations and research institutes (Institute of International Relations Clingendael, European Centre for Development Policy Management, Netherlands Atlantic Association, Transnational Institute, Club of Rome, Humanistic Association, Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities and the Carnegie Foundation) and as an advocate and lobbyist for European integration and humanism. He was known for his abilities as a negotiator and manager. Mansholt continued to comment on political affairs as an elder statesman until his death. He holds the distinction of being the longest-serving Minister of Agriculture, the longest-serving European Commissioner from the Netherlands, the longest-serving European Commissioner for Agriculture and the only Dutchman to have served as President of the European Commission. He is recognized as one of the Founding fathers of the European Union.

== Early life and studies ==
Sicco Leendert Mansholt was born on 13 September 1908 in Ulrum, in the province of Groningen, Netherlands. Mansholt came from a socialist farmer&#x27;s family in the province of Groningen. Both his father and grandfather were supporters of early socialist leaders such as Multatuli, Domela Nieuwenhuis, and Troelstra. His father, Lambertus H. Mansholt, was a delegate for the socialist SDAP party in the Groningen provincial chamber. His mother, Wabien Andreae, daughter of a judge in Heerenveen, was one of the first women to have studied political science. She organised political meetings for other women, usually in their own homes. Together with two brothers and two sisters, Mansholt was raised at &quot;Huis ter Aa&quot;, a grand villa in Glimmen. He attended the HBS school in Groningen and after that went to Deventer, to the School of Tropical Agriculture, where he studied to become a tobacco farmer.

== Agriculture ==
Mansholt moved to Java in the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), and started work on a tea plantation. He returned to the Netherlands in 1936, unhappy with the colonial system. He wanted to become a farmer and moved to the Wieringermeer, a polder, reclaimed in 1937. There he started his own farm.

Mansholt married Henny J. Postel in 1938, and they had two sons and two daughters. In the years of World War II, he was an active member of the Resistance. He helped people who were in acute danger to hide in the Wieringermeerpolder; he organised clandestine food distributions for the western provinces.

== Politics ==
=== Local politics ===
Mansholt became a member of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) in 1937, as a secretary of the local party. He had several public functions for the SDAP in Wieringermeer, including that of acting mayor of the Wieringermeer community.

=== Minister of Agriculture ===
Immediately after the war, in June 1945, Labour Party (PvdA) Prime Minister Schermerhorn asked him to take a seat in his cabinet as minister of Agriculture, Fishery and Food Distribution. He was the youngest member of a cabinet, aged only 36.

Mansholt was a member of six cabinets in total: Schermerhorn-Drees in 1945; Beel in 1946; Drees-Van Schaik in 1948, and the three Drees administrations: 1951, 1952 and 1956. As Minister of Agriculture during this time, he was one of the key architects of the EC&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy. In 1954 the parliamentary debate about the budget for the Department of Agriculture was postponed: the Minister was ice-skating the 200-kilometre-long Elfstedentocht in the Dutch province of Friesland, which he skated twice in his life.

=== European Commission ===
In 1958, Mansholt became one of the Commissioners of the new European Commission. He was Commissioner for Agriculture and vice-president of the institution. He modernized European agriculture. The Mansholt Plan was opposed by E. F. Schumacher in his book &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;.

Mansholt became President of the European Commission on 22 March 1972 (the Mansholt Commission) and continued in that position until 5 January 1973. It was around that time he was heavily under the influence of the Club of Rome.

== Life after politics ==
Mansholt published his autobiography &quot;De Crisis&quot; (&quot;The Crisis&quot;) in 1974. He lived his last years in an old historic farm in the quiet village of Wapserveen, where he died on 29 June 1995. His daughter Lideke also died in 1995, aged 53.

<doc id="452887" wikidata="Q878138" url="?curid=452887" title="Fur trade">
<text>The fur trade is a worldwide industry dealing in the acquisition and sale of animal fur. Since the establishment of a world fur market in the early modern period, furs of boreal, polar and cold temperate mammalian animals have been the most valued. Historically the trade stimulated the exploration and colonization of Siberia, northern North America, and the South Shetland and South Sandwich Islands.

Today the importance of the fur trade has diminished; it is based on pelts produced at fur farms and regulated fur-bearer trapping, but has become controversial. Animal rights organizations oppose the fur trade, citing that animals are brutally killed and sometimes skinned alive. Fur has been replaced in some clothing by synthetic imitations, for example, as in ruffs on hoods of parkas.

== Continental fur trade ==
===Russian fur trade===
Before the European colonization of the Americas, Russia was a major supplier of fur pelts to Western Europe and parts of Asia. Its trade developed in the Early Middle Ages (500–1000 AD/CE), first through exchanges at posts around the Baltic and Black seas. The main trading market destination was the German city of Leipzig. Kievan Rus&#x27; was the first supplier of the Russian fur trade.

Originally, Russia exported raw furs, consisting in most cases of the pelts of martens, beavers, wolves, foxes, squirrels and hares. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, Russians began to settle in Siberia, a region rich in many mammal fur species, such as Arctic fox, lynx, sable, sea otter and stoat (ermine). In a search for the prized sea otter pelts, first used in China, and later for the northern fur seal, the Russian Empire expanded into North America, notably Alaska. From the 17th through the second half of the 19th century, Russia was the world&#x27;s largest supplier of fur. The fur trade played a vital role in the development of Siberia, the Russian Far East and the Russian colonization of the Americas. As recognition of the importance of the trade to the Siberian economy, the sable is a regional symbol of Sverdlovsk Oblast in the Urals and Novosibirsk, Tyumen and Irkutsk Oblasts in Siberia.

European contact with North America, with its vast forests and wildlife, particularly the beaver, led to the continent becoming a major supplier in the 17th century of fur pelts for the fur felt hat and fur trimming and garment trades of Europe. Fur was relied on to make warm clothing, a critical consideration prior to the organization of coal distribution for heating. Portugal and Spain played major roles in fur trading after the 15th century with their business in fur hats.

====Siberian fur trade====
From as early as the 10th century, merchants and boyars of the city-state of Novgorod had exploited the fur resources &quot;beyond the portage&quot;, a watershed at the White Lake that represents the door to the entire northwestern part of Eurasia. They began by establishing trading posts along the Volga and Vychegda river networks and requiring the Komi people to give them furs as tribute. Novgorod, the chief fur-trade center prospered as the easternmost trading post of the Hanseatic League. Novgorodians expanded farther east and north, coming into contact with the Pechora people of the Pechora River valley and the Yugra people residing near the Urals. Both of these native tribes offered more resistance than the Komi, killing many Russian tribute-collectors throughout the tenth and eleventh centuries.

As the Grand Principality of Moscow increased in power over the course of the 15th century and proceeded with the &quot;gathering of the Russian lands&quot;, the Muscovite state began to rival the Novgorodians in the north for the Russian fur trade; ultimately, Novgorod would lose its autonomy and be absorbed by the authorities in Moscow along with its vast hinterland. At the same time, Moscow began subjugating many native tribes. One strategy involved exploiting antagonisms between tribes, notably the Komi and Yugra, by recruiting men of one tribe to fight in an army against the other tribe. Campaigns against native tribes in Siberia remained insignificant until they began on a much larger scale in 1483 and 1499–1500.

Besides the Novgorodians and the indigenes, the Muscovites also had to contend with the various Muslim Tatar khanates to their east. In 1552, Ivan IV, the tsar of all Russia, took a significant step towards securing Russian hegemony in Siberia when he sent a large army to attack the Khanate of Kazan and ended up obtaining the territory from the Volga to the Ural Mountains. At this point the phrase, &quot;ruler of Obdor, Konda, and all Siberian lands&quot; became part of the title of the tsar in Moscow. Even so, problems ensued after 1558 when Ivan IV sent () to colonize land on the Kama and to subjugate and enserf the Komi living there. The Stroganov family soon came into conflict in 1573 with the khan of Sibir whose land they encroached on. Ivan told the Stroganovs to hire Cossack mercenaries to protect the new settlement from the Tatars. From the band of Cossacks led by Yermak Timofeyevich fought many battles that eventually culminated in a Tartar victory in 1584 and the temporary end to Russian occupation in the area. In 1584, Ivan&#x27;s son Feodor sent military governors (voivodas) and soldiers to reclaim Yermak conquests and officially to annex the land held by the Khanate of Sibir. Similar skirmishes with Tartars took place across Siberia as Russian expansion continued.

Russian conquerors treated the natives of Siberia as easily exploited subjects who were inferior to them. As they penetrated deeper into Siberia, traders built outposts or winter lodges called &quot;&quot; where they lived and collected fur tribute from native tribes. By 1620 Russia dominated the land from the Urals eastward to the Yenisey valley and to the Altai Mountains in the south, comprising about 1.25 million square miles of land.

Furs would become Russia&#x27;s largest source of wealth during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Keeping up with the advances of Western Europe required significant capital and Russia did not have sources of gold and silver, but it did have furs, which became known as &quot;soft gold&quot; and provided Russia with hard currency. The Russian government received income from the fur trade through two taxes, the &quot;yasak&quot; (or iasak) tax on natives and the 10% &quot;Sovereign Tithing Tax&quot; imposed on both the catch and sale of fur pelts. Fur was in great demand in Western Europe, especially sable and marten, since European forest resources had been over-hunted and furs had become extremely scarce. Fur trading allowed Russia to purchase from Europe goods that it lacked, like lead, tin, precious metals, textiles, firearms, and sulphur. Russia also traded furs with Ottoman Turkey and other countries in the Middle East in exchange for silk, textiles, spices, and dried fruit. The high prices that sable, black fox, and marten furs could generate in international markets spurred a &quot;fur fever&quot; in which many Russians moved to Siberia as independent trappers. From 1585 to 1680, tens of thousands of sable and other valuable pelts were obtained in Siberia each year.
The primary way for the Russian state to obtain furs was by exacting a fur tribute from the Siberian natives, called a &quot;yasak&quot;. &quot;Yasak&quot; was usually a fixed number of sable pelts which every male tribe member who was at least fifteen years old had to supply to Russian officials. Officials enforced &quot;yasak&quot; through coercion and by taking hostages, usually the tribe chiefs or members of the chief&#x27;s family. At first, Russians were content to trade with the natives, exchanging goods like pots, axes, and beads for the prized sables that the natives did not value, but greater demand for furs led to violence and force becoming the primary means of obtaining the furs. The largest problem with the &quot;yasak&quot; system was that Russian governors were prone to corruption because they received no salary. They resorted to illegal means of getting furs for themselves, including bribing customs officials to allow them to personally collect &quot;yasak&quot;, extorting natives by exacting &quot;yasak&quot; multiple times over, or requiring tribute from independent trappers.

Russian fur trappers, called &quot;promyshlenniki&quot;, hunted in one of two types of bands of 10–15 men, called &quot;&quot;. The first was an independent band of blood relatives or unrelated people who contributed an equal share of the hunting-expedition expenses; the second was a band of hired hunters who participated in expeditions fully funded by the trading companies which employed them. Members of an independent &quot;vataga&quot; cooperated and shared all necessary work associated with fur trapping, including making and setting traps, building forts and camps, stockpiling firewood and grain, and fishing. All fur pelts went into a common pool that the band divided equally among themselves after Russian officials exacted the tithing tax. On the other hand, a trading company provided hired fur-trappers with the money needed for transportation, food, and supplies, and once the hunt was finished, the employer received two-thirds of the pelts and the remaining ones were sold and the proceeds divided evenly among the hired laborers. During the summer, &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; would set up a summer camp to stockpile grain and fish, and many engaged in agricultural work for extra money. During late summer or early fall the &quot;vatagi&quot; left their hunting grounds, surveyed the area, and set up a winter camp. Each member of the group set at least 10 traps and the &quot;vatagi&quot; divided into smaller groups of two to three men who cooperated to maintain certain traps. &quot;Promyshlenniki&quot; checked traps daily, resetting them or replacing bait whenever necessary. The &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; employed both passive and active hunting-strategies. The passive approach involved setting traps, while the active approach involved the use of hunting-dogs and of bows-and-arrows. Occasionally, hunters also followed sable tracks to their burrows, around which they placed nets, and waited for the sable to emerge.

The hunting season began around the time of the first snow in October or November and continued until early spring. Hunting expeditions lasted two to three years on average but occasionally longer. Because of the long hunting season and the fact that passage back to Russia was difficult and costly, beginning around the 1650s–1660s, many &quot;promyshlenniki&quot; chose to stay and settle in Siberia. From 1620 to 1680, a total of 15,983 trappers operated in Siberia.

===North American fur trade===

The North American fur trade began as early as the 1500s between Europeans and First Nations (see: Early French Fur Trading) and was a central part of the early history of contact between Europeans and the native peoples of what is now the United States and Canada. Dr. S. E. Dawson&#x27;s admirable &quot;The Saint Lawrence Its Basin &amp; Border-Lands&quot; covers in detail the twenty-or-so main &quot;gateways&quot; connecting the St. Lawrence River
with its neighbouring basins. Though these were all once canoe routes,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fur Trade Canoe Routes of Canada / Then and Now&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; not all were trade routes. In 1578 there were 350 European fishing vessels at Newfoundland. Sailors began to trade metal implements (particularly knives) for the natives&#x27; well-worn pelts. The first pelts in demand were beaver and sea otter, as well as occasionally deer, bear, ermine and skunk.

Fur robes were blankets of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. The pelts were called &quot;castor gras&quot; in French and &quot;coat beaver&quot; in English, and were soon recognized by the newly developed felt-hat making industry as particularly useful for felting. Some historians, seeking to explain the term &quot;castor gras&quot;, have assumed that coat beaver was rich in human oils from having been worn so long (much of the top-hair was worn away through usage, exposing the valuable under-wool), and that this is what made it attractive to the hatters. This seems unlikely, since grease interferes with the felting of wool, rather than enhancing it. By the 1580s, beaver &quot;wool&quot; was the major starting material of the French felt-hatters. Hat makers began to use it in England soon after, particularly after Huguenot refugees brought their skills and tastes with them from France.

====Early organization====

Captain Chauvin made the first organized attempt to control the fur trade in New France. In 1599 he acquired a monopoly from Henry IV and tried to establish a colony near the mouth of the Saguenay River at Tadoussac. French explorers, like Samuel de Champlain, voyageurs, and Coureur des bois, such as Étienne Brûlé, Radisson, La Salle, and Le Sueur, while seeking routes through the continent, established relationships with Amerindians and continued to expand the trade of fur pelts for items considered &#x27;common&#x27; by the Europeans. Mammal winter pelts were prized for warmth, particularly animal pelts for beaver wool felt hats, which were an expensive status symbol in Europe. The demand for beaver wool felt hats was such that the beaver in Europe and European Russia had largely disappeared through exploitation.

In 1613 Dallas Carite and Adriaen Block headed expeditions to establish fur trade relationships with the Mohawk and Mohican. By 1614 the Dutch were sending vessels to secure large economic returns from fur trading. The fur trade of New Netherland, through the port of New Amsterdam, depended largely on the trading depot at Fort Orange (now Albany) on the upper Hudson River. Much of the fur is believed to have originated in Canada, smuggled south by entrepreneurs who wished to avoid the colony&#x27;s government-imposed monopoly there.

England was slower to enter the American fur trade than France and the Dutch Republic, but as soon as English colonies were established, development companies learned that furs provided the best way for the colonists to remit value back to the mother country. Furs were being dispatched from Virginia soon after 1610, and the Plymouth Colony was sending substantial amounts of beaver to its London agents through the 1620s and 1630s. London merchants tried to take over France&#x27;s fur trade in the St Lawrence River valley. Taking advantage of one of England&#x27;s wars with France, Sir David Kirke captured Quebec in 1629 and brought the year&#x27;s produce of furs back to London. Other English merchants also traded for furs around the Saint Lawrence River region in the 1630s, but these were officially discouraged. Such efforts ceased as France strengthened its presence in Canada.

Much of the fur trade in North America during the 17th and 18th centuries was dominated by the Canadian fur shipping network that developed in New France under the fur monopoly held first by the Company of One Hundred Associates, then followed in 1664 by the French West India Company, steadily expanding fur trapping and shipping across a network of frontier forts further west that eventually went all the way to modern day Winnipeg in Western Canada by the mid-1700s, coming into direct contact and opposition with the English fur trappers stationed out of York Factory at Hudson Bay. Meanwhile, the New England fur trade expanded as well, not only inland, but northward along the coast into the Bay of Fundy region. London&#x27;s access to high-quality furs was greatly increased with the takeover of New Amsterdam, whereupon the fur trade of that colony (now called New York) fell into English hands with the 1667 Treaty of Breda.

In 1668 the English fur trade entered a new phase. Two French citizens, Pierre-Esprit Radisson and Médard des Groseilliers, had traded with great success west of Lake Superior in 1659–60, but upon their return to Canada, most of their furs were seized by the authorities. Their trading voyage had convinced them that the best fur country was far to the north and west, and could best be reached by ships sailing into Hudson Bay. Their treatment in Canada suggested that they would not find support from France for their scheme. The pair went to New England, where they found local financial support for at least two attempts to reach Hudson Bay, both unsuccessful. Their ideas had reached the ears of English authorities, however, and in 1665 Radisson and Groseilliers were persuaded to go to London. After some setbacks, a number of English investors were found to back another attempt for Hudson Bay.

Two ships were sent out in 1668. One, with Radisson aboard, had to turn back, but the other, the &quot;Nonsuch,&quot; with Groseilliers, did penetrate the bay. There she was able to trade with the indigenes, collecting a fine cargo of beaver skins before the expedition returned to London in October 1669. The delighted investors sought a royal charter, which they obtained the next year. This charter established the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and granted it a monopoly to trade into all the rivers that emptied into Hudson Bay. From 1670 onwards, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent two or three trading ships into the bay every year. They brought back furs (mainly beaver) and sold them, sometimes by private treaty but usually by public auction. The beaver was bought mainly for the English hat-making trade, while the fine furs went to the Netherlands and Germany.

Meanwhile, in the Southern colonies, a deerskin trade was established around 1670, based at the export hub of Charleston, South Carolina. Word spread among Native hunters that the Europeans would exchange pelts for the European-manufactured goods that were highly desired in native communities. Carolinan traders stocked axe heads, knives, awls, fish hooks, cloth of various type and color, woolen blankets, linen shirts, kettles, jewelry, glass beads, muskets, ammunition and powder to exchange on a &#x27;per pelt&#x27; basis.

Colonial trading posts in the southern colonies also introduced many types of alcohol (especially brandy and rum) for trade. European traders flocked to the North American continent and made huge profits from the exchange. A metal axe head, for example, was exchanged for one beaver pelt (also called a &#x27;beaver blanket&#x27;). The same pelt could fetch enough to buy dozens of axe heads in England, making the fur trade extremely profitable for the Europeans. The Natives used the iron axe heads to replace stone axe heads which they had made by hand in a labor-intensive process, so they derived substantial benefits from the trade as well. The colonists began to see the ill effects of alcohol on Natives, and the chiefs objected to its sale and trade. The Royal Proclamation of 1763 prohibited sale by European settlers of alcohol to the Indians in Canada, following the British takeover of the territory after it defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War in North America).

Following the British take over of Canada from France, the control of the fur trade in North America became consolidated under the British government for a time, until the United States was created and became a major source for furs being shipped to Europe as well in the nineteenth century, along with the largely unsettled territory of Russian America, which became a significant source of furs also during that period. The fur trade began to significantly decline starting in the 1830s, following changing attitudes and fashions in Europe and America which no longer centered around certain articles of clothing as much such as beaver skin hats, which had fueled the growing demand for furs, driving the creation and expansion of the fur trade in the 17th and 18th centuries, although new trends as well as occasional revivals of prior fashions would cause the fur trade to ebb and flow right up to the present.

=====Socioeconomic ties=====
Often, the political benefits of the fur trade became more important than the economic aspects. Trade was a way to forge alliances and maintain good relations between different cultures. The fur traders were men with capital and social standing. Often younger men were single when they went to North America to enter the fur trade; they made marriages or cohabited with high-ranking Indian women of similar status in their own cultures. Fur trappers and other workers usually had relationships with lower-ranking women. Many of their mixed-race descendants developed their own culture, now called &quot;Métis&quot; in Canada, based then on fur trapping and other activities on the frontier.

In some cases both Native American and European-American cultures excluded the mixed-race descendants. If the Native Americans were a tribe with a patrilineal kinship system, they considered children born to a white father to be white, in a type of hypodescent classification, although the Native mother and tribe might care for them. The Europeans tended to classify children of Native women as Native, regardless of the father, similar to the hypodescent of their classification of the children of slaves. The Métis in the Canadian Red River region were so numerous that they developed a creole language and culture. Since the late 20th century, the Métis have been recognized in Canada as a First Nations ethnic group. The interracial relationships resulted in a two-tier mixed-race class, in which descendants of fur traders and chiefs achieved prominence in some Canadian social, political, and economic circles. Lower-class descendants formed the majority of the separate Métis culture based on hunting, trapping and farming.

Because of the wealth at stake, different European-American governments competed with various native societies for control of the fur trade. Native Americans sometimes based decisions of which side to support in times of war in relation to which people had provided them with the best trade goods in an honest manner. Because trade was so politically important, the Europeans tried to regulate it in hopes (often futile) of preventing abuse. Unscrupulous traders sometimes cheated natives by plying them with alcohol during the transaction, which subsequently aroused resentment and often resulted in violence.

In 1834 John Jacob Astor, who had created the huge monopoly of the American Fur Company, withdrew from the fur trade. He could see the decline in fur animals and realized the market was changing, as beaver hats went out of style. Expanding European settlement displaced native communities from the best hunting grounds. European demand for furs subsided as fashion trends shifted. The Native Americans&#x27; lifestyles were altered by the trade. To continue obtaining European goods on which they had become dependent and to pay off their debts, they often resorted to selling land to the European settlers. Their resentment of the forced sales contributed to future wars.
After the United States became independent, it regulated trading with Native Americans by the Indian Intercourse Act, first passed on July 22, 1790. The Bureau of Indian Affairs issued licenses to trade in the Indian Territory. In 1834 this was defined as most of the United States west of the Mississippi River, where mountain men and traders from Mexico freely operated.

Early exploration parties were often fur-trading expeditions, many of which marked the first recorded instances of Europeans&#x27; reaching particular regions of North America. For example, Abraham Wood sent fur-trading parties on exploring expeditions into the southern Appalachian Mountains, discovering the New River in the process. Simon Fraser was a fur trader who explored much of the Fraser River in British Columbia.

=====Role in economic anthropology=====
Economic historians and anthropologists have studied the fur trade&#x27;s important role in early North American economies, but they have been unable to agree on a theoretical framework to describe native economic patterns.
John C. Phillips and J.W. Smurr tied the fur trade to an imperial struggle for power, positing that the fur trade served both as an incentive for expanding and as a method for maintaining dominance. Dismissing the experience of individuals, the authors searched for connections on a global stage that revealed its &quot;high political and economic importance.&quot; E.E. Rich brought the economic purview down a level, focusing on the role of trading companies and their men as the ones who &quot;opened up&quot; much of Canada&#x27;s territories, instead of on the role of the nation-state in opening up the continent.

Rich&#x27;s other work gets to the heart of the formalist/substantivist debate that dominated the field or, as some came to believe, muddied it. Historians such as Harold Innis had long taken the formalist position, especially in Canadian history, believing that neoclassical economic principles affect non-Western societies just as they do Western ones. Starting in the 1950s, however, substantivists such as Karl Polanyi challenged these ideas, arguing instead that primitive societies could engage in alternatives to traditional Western market trade; namely, gift trade and administered trade. Rich picked up these arguments in an influential article in which he contended that Indians had &quot;a persistent reluctance to accept European notions or the basic values of the European approach&quot; and that &quot;English economic rules did not apply to the Indian trade.&quot; Indians were savvy traders, but they had a fundamentally different conception of property, which confounded their European trade partners. Abraham Rotstein subsequently fit these arguments explicitly into Polanyi&#x27;s theoretical framework, claiming that &quot;administered trade was in operation at the Bay and market trade in London.&quot;
Arthur J. Ray permanently changed the direction of economic studies of the fur trade with two influential works that presented a modified formalist position in between the extremes of Innis and Rotstein. &quot;This trading system,&quot; Ray explained, &quot;is impossible to label neatly as ‘gift trade&#x27;, or ‘administered trade&#x27;, or ‘market trade&#x27;, since it embodies elements of all these forms.&quot; Indians engaged in trade for a variety of reasons. Reducing them to simple economic or cultural dichotomies, as the formalists and substantivists had done, was a fruitless simplification that obscured more than it revealed. Moreover, Ray used trade accounts and account books in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s archives for masterful qualitative analyses and pushed the boundaries of the field&#x27;s methodology. Following Ray&#x27;s position, Bruce M. White also helped to create a more nuanced picture of the complex ways in which native populations fit new economic relationships into existing cultural patterns.

Richard White, while admitting that the formalist/substantivist debate was &quot;old, and now tired,&quot; attempted to reinvigorate the substantivist position. Echoing Ray&#x27;s moderate position that cautioned against easy simplifications, White advanced a simple argument against formalism: &quot;Life was not a business, and such simplifications only distort the past.&quot; White argued instead that the fur trade occupied part of a &quot;middle ground&quot; in which Europeans and Indians sought to accommodate their cultural differences. In the case of the fur trade, this meant that the French were forced to learn from the political and cultural meanings with which Indians imbued the fur trade. Cooperation, not domination, prevailed.

=====Present=====
According to the Fur Institute of Canada, there are about 60,000 active trappers in Canada (based on trapping licenses), of whom about 25,000 are indigenous peoples. The fur farming industry is present in many parts of Canada. The largest producer of mink and foxes is Nova Scotia which in 2012 generated revenues of nearly $150 million and accounted for one quarter of all agricultural production in the Province.

In 2000 there were 351 Mink farms in the U.S. As of 2015 there were 176,573 trappers in the U.S. with most being in the midwest. California was the first (and only) state to ban trapping for commercial and recreation purposes in 2015.

The North American Fur Auction (NAFA) occurs four times a year and attracts buyers from around the world.

According to the Northeast Association of Fish &amp; Wildlife Agencies, at present approximately 270,000 families in the United States and Canada derive some of their income from fur trapping.

== Maritime fur trade ==
The maritime fur trade was a ship-based fur trade system that focused on acquiring furs of sea otters and other animals from the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and natives of Alaska. The furs were mostly traded in China for tea, silks, porcelain, and other Chinese goods, which were then sold in Europe and the United States. The maritime fur trade was pioneered by the Russians, working east from Kamchatka along the Aleutian Islands to the southern coast of Alaska. British and Americans entered during the 1780s, focusing on what is now the coast of British Columbia. The trade boomed around the turn of the 19th century. A long period of decline began in the 1810s. As the sea otter population was depleted, the maritime fur trade diversified and was transformed, tapping new markets and commodities while continuing to focus on the Northwest Coast and China. It lasted until the middle to late 19th century. Russians controlled most of the coast of what is now Alaska during the entire era. The coast south of Alaska saw fierce competition between, and among, British and American trading vessels. The British were the first to operate in the southern sector, but were unable to compete against the Americans who dominated from the 1790s to the 1830s. The British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company entered the coast trade in the 1820s with the intention of driving the Americans away. This was accomplished by about 1840. In its late period the maritime fur trade was largely conducted by the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the Russian-American Company.
The term &quot;maritime fur trade&quot; was coined by historians to distinguish the coastal, ship-based fur trade from the continental, land-based fur trade of, for example, the North West Company and the American Fur Company. Historically, the maritime fur trade was not known by that name, rather it was usually called the &quot;North West Coast trade&quot; or &quot;North West Trade&quot;. The term &quot;North West&quot; was rarely spelled as the single word &quot;Northwest&quot;, as is common today.

The maritime fur trade brought the Pacific Northwest coast into a vast, new international trade network, centered on the north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on capitalism but not, for the most part, on colonialism. A triangular trade network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the Hawaiian Islands (only recently discovered by the Western world), Europe, and the United States (especially New England). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the Aleut, Tlingit, Haida, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Chinook peoples. There was a rapid increase of wealth among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, potlatching, slaving, depopulation due to epidemic disease, and enhanced importance of totems and traditional nobility crests. The indigenous culture was not however overwhelmed, it rather flourished, while simultaneously undergoing rapid change. The use of Chinook Jargon arose during the maritime fur trading era and remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture. Native Hawaiian society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade&#x27;s effect on China and Europe was minimal. For New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to the transformation of New England from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially textile manufacturing. The New England textile industry in turn had a large effect on slavery in the United States, increasing the demand for cotton and helping make possible the rapid expansion of the cotton plantation system across the Deep South.

The most profitable furs were those of sea otters, especially the northern sea otter, &quot;Enhydra lutris kenyoni&quot;, which inhabited the coastal waters between the Columbia River to the south and Cook Inlet to the north. The fur of the Californian southern sea otter, &quot;E. l. nereis&quot;, was less highly prized and thus less profitable. After the northern sea otter was hunted to local extinction, maritime fur traders shifted to California until the southern sea otter was likewise nearly extinct. The British and American maritime fur traders took their furs to the Chinese port of Guangzhou (Canton), where they worked within the established Canton System. Furs from Russian America were mostly sold to China via the Mongolian trading town of Kyakhta, which had been opened to Russian trade by the 1727 Treaty of Kyakhta.

<doc id="452890" wikidata="Q3234187" url="?curid=452890" title="Boohbah">
<text>Boohbah is a British preschool television series created by Anne Wood and produced by Wood&#x27;s company, Ragdoll Productions, in association with GMTV. It premiered on ITV on 14 April 2003. The series was later broadcast on Nick Jr.UK beginning on 2 April 2005.

The series, with 104 episodes, was designed for preschoolers aged three to six (a slightly older age group than Wood&#x27;s previous show, &quot;Teletubbies&quot;).

According to Anne Wood, the show&#x27;s visuals were inspired by scientific photographs of microscopic life and cell structures. The main characters, the Boohbahs, are &quot;atoms of energy&quot; who sleep in charging pods. Every episode follows the Boohbahs performing a dance routine where the audience is encouraged to participate. The creators at Ragdoll Productions designed the show as an interactive &quot;televisual game&quot; with an emphasis on spatial awareness, motor skill development and puzzle solving.

==Characters==
Episodes of &quot;Boohbah&quot; are divided into two main segments: one featuring the Boohbahs and another featuring the Storypeople.

===Boohbahs===
The series focuses on the Boohbahs, five colourful creatures who are described as &quot;magical atoms&quot; of energy. They are played by actors in full-body costumes. Their fur sparkles and shimmers with tiny lights, and they have big eyes and rows of lights for eyebrows. Each Boohbah is a different colour:
* Humbah, played by Emma Insley, is a yellow Boohbah.
* Zumbah, played by Alex Poulter, is a purple Boohbah.
* Zing Zing Zingbah, played by Cal Jaggers, is an orange Boohbah.
* Jumbah, played by Phil Hayes, is a blue Boohbah.
* Jingbah, played by Laura Pero, is a pink Boohbah.

===Storypeople===
The Storypeople are silent human characters whose actions are controlled by off-screen children using the magic word &quot;Boohbah&quot;. Every episode of &quot;Boohbah&quot; includes a segment where the Storypeople are magically given a present. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called these segments &quot;comic visual puzzles executed with vaudevillian flair.&quot;
* Grandmamma (Linda Kerr-Scott) – An elderly yet spry Caucasian woman. She has white banana hair and wears a dark pink housedress, pastel blue sweater, white socks, and red trainers.
* Grandpappa (Robin Stevens) – An elderly yet spry Caucasian man. He has white hair and a white moustache; he wears a long-sleeved yellow shirt, dark grey slacks, red braces, and white trainers.
* Mrs. Lady (Harvey Virdi) – An Indian woman. She has dark hair and wears a loose light blue blouse, loose bright pink trousers, and pink trainers.
* Mr. Man (Mark Ramsey) – A Black man. He wears a short-sleeved bright pink shirt, white trousers, and black trainers.
* Brother (Manuel Bravo) and Sister (Vee Vimolmal) – &quot;Always&quot; paired, they both appear to be in their late teens. Brother is a Spanish boy with short black hair; he wears a bright blue T-shirt, bright red knee-length shorts, and white trainers with pink laces. Sister is a Thai girl with hip-length black hair in a long ponytail; she wears a bright red T-shirt, bright blue capri pants, and white trainers with pink laces.
* Auntie (Sachi Kimura) – A Japanese woman. She has short black hair and wears a long-sleeved lavender blouse, black trousers, purple tights, and black shoes.
* Little Dog Fido (Dash) – A Jack Russell Terrier. He wears a red collar. He is the only character in Storyworld who is not wholly controlled by the magic word &quot;Boohbah&quot;.

==Development and broadcast==
Production of &quot;Boohbah&quot; began shortly after Ragdoll released a direct-to-video &quot;Teletubbies&quot; release titled &quot;Teletubbies Go!&quot; in 2001, which featured segments of the characters exercising. The high sales of the release led to Ragdoll&#x27;s fear of obesity in children and what led the company to develop an exercise-based programme.

In November 2002, ITV&#x27;s pre-school strand CITV and breakfast franchisee GMTV signed a five-year broadcast commitment deal with Ragdoll where both broadcasters would share weekday and weekend broadcasts of the series in the United Kingdom respectively. 104 episodes were planned to be split into two series, with the first airing in Spring 2003, and the second series being broadcast in 2004. On the same day, it was announced that Video Collection International, who had a long-time home video agreement with Ragdoll, would release the series on VHS and DVD in the country.

The series premiered as planned on ITV on 14 April 2003 and later debuted on GMTV&#x27;s weekend pre-school slot at the same time. Ragdoll held worldwide distribution rights to the series.

In June 2003, Ragdoll announced their plans to launch &quot;Boohbah&quot; in the United States. They confirmed that PBS, Scholastic and Hasbro, the same companies who held the licenses to &quot;Teletubbies&quot; in the United States, had acquired TV, publishing and toy rights respectively. In the United Kingdom, the first DVD release: &quot;Boohbah Magic&quot;, was released on 26 May, and shot into the Children&#x27;s Charts at No. 2. In October 2003, Ragdoll announced that Canal+ and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation had acquired French and Australian broadcast rights to the series, where the series would launch in January 2004 and Spring 2004 window in both regions. Ragdoll also announced that the show would premiere in the United States on PBS on 19 January 2004. In the same month, Hasbro signed a separate worldwide toy deal for the show except for the UK, Ireland, Americas and Asia.

In March 2004, Ragdoll announced that the second series would premiere in the UK on CITV on the 16th. In the same month, another VHS/DVD release – &quot;Squeaky Socks&quot;, was announced to be released on 10 May. At MIPTV 2004 within the same month, Ragdoll announced more broadcast deals for the show. Treehouse TV acquired the series in English-speaking Canada and would begin airing on 26 April, complementing an earlier French-speaking deal with Société Radio-Canada. It was also announced that BabyTV in Israel and POGO in India were already broadcasting the series as well. Canal 13 in Chile and TV12 in Singapore also acquired the broadcast rights in their respective countries for broadcast later on in 2004. Another deal already announced was one with Viacom International, where Nickelodeon in the Netherlands and MTV in Belgium acquired the Dutch-speaking rights, where the show would air on the Nick Jr. blocks for both channels beginning on 5 April 2004. In October, Ragdoll pre-sold the series to Guangzhou Beauty in China for a launch within Chinese New Year 2005.

In March 2005, Nick Jr.UK acquired the UK pay-TV rights to the series, and the series would premiere on the channel on 2 April 2005. The programme became a regular fixture of the Nick Jr. UK schedule, airing seven days a week at 7:00 a.m. to start off Nick Jr.&#x27;s morning schedule. In July 2005, Ragdoll announced that the show would premiere on CCTV&#x27;s Youth Channel in China on the 11th. SABC 2 was also announced to have acquired the South African broadcast rights, and would premiere the show in the country on the same day.

In the United States, the series was aired on PBS Kids from 19 January 2004 until 31 August 2008. It also aired on PBS Kids Sprout from 2005 to 2009, where it was shown as part of the programming blocks &quot;Sprout Mornings&quot; and &quot;The Good Night Show&quot;.

==Episodes==
Two series, each containing 52 episodes, were produced for a total of 104 episodes. Many episodes were written by Robin Stevens, who played Grandpappa on the show.

==Reception==
Ken Tucker, in his review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the show an &quot;A−&quot; score and commented, &quot;I&#x27;m positive that &quot;Boohbah&quot; can be experienced by both its intended audience (kids ages 3 to 6) and its inevitable inadvertent audience (doting parents and stoners of every age) as a mind-blowing gas.&quot; Tucker joked that when &quot;Boohbah&quot; aired in America, it would prove more popular than &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; due to having more &quot;flashing lights, blinding colors, and silly noise&quot;. Lorraine Ali, a senior writer for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, also gave &quot;Boohbah&quot; a positive review and wrote, &quot;Move over, Barney, and make room for Zing Zing Zingbah.&quot; Common Sense Media gave &quot;Boohbah&quot; a rating of 3/5 stars, writing that its educational and fitness goals were &quot;admirable&quot;, but that &quot;the real test is whether or not the show works with your kid.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; commented that although the show&#x27;s sequence of events &quot;may sound incoherent ... the overall effect is mesmerizing, sometimes funny, even beautiful.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; felt that the &quot;segments featuring the Boohbahs are ploddingly slow, maddeningly repetitive, and without much purpose ... the live-action segments with real people are the only things worth watching.&quot; &quot;Slate&quot; was bemused by the show&#x27;s segments and design, feeling that &quot;Boohbah&quot; was less effective than Anne Wood&#x27;s previous show &quot;Teletubbies&quot;: &quot;For all its earnest intentions, &quot;Boohbah&quot; lacks both the conceptual purity of &quot;Teletubbies&quot; and its sublimely silly sensibility.&quot; &quot;Cheat Sheet&quot; ranked the show first on their list of &quot;5 Most Horrifying TV Shows That Aren&#x27;t Supposed to Be Scary&quot;, criticising the characters&#x27; appearances, although crediting it for encouraging children to perform in physical exercise.
