<text>The Constitution of 3 May 1791, titled the Government Act, was a written constitution for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that was adopted by the Great Sejm that met between 1788 and 1792. The Commonwealth was a dual monarchy comprising the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; the new constitution was intended to address political questions following a period of political agitation and gradual reform that began with the Convocation Sejm of 1764 and the election that year of the Commonwealth&#x27;s last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski. It was the first codified, modern constitution (possessing checks and balances and a tripartite separation of powers) in Europe and the second in the world, after that of the United States.

The Constitution sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy, introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the government&#x27;s protection, mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. It banned pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any single deputy, who could veto and thus undo all the legislation adopted by that Sejm. The Commonwealth&#x27;s neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the Constitution. King Frederick William II of Prussia broke the Prussian alliance with the Commonwealth, joining with Imperial Russia under Catherine the Great and the anti-reform Targowica Confederation of Polish magnates, to defeat the Commonwealth in the Polish–Russian War of 1792.

The 1791 Constitution was in force for less than 19 months. It was declared null and void by the Grodno Sejm that met in 1793, though the Sejm&#x27;s legal power to do so was questionable. The Second and Third Partitions of the Commonwealth (1793, 1795) ultimately ended Poland&#x27;s and Lithuania&#x27;s sovereign existence until the close of World War I in 1918. Over those 123 years, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country&#x27;s sovereignty. In the words of two of its principal authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, the 1791 Constitution was &quot;the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland&quot;.

== Background ==
Polish constitutionalism can be traced to the 13th century, when government by consensus and representation was already well established in the young Polish state. The emergence of parliamentary bodies, the sejm and sejmiki, followed in the first half of the 16th century. By the 17th century, Poland&#x27;s legal and political tradition was characterized as parliamentary institutions and a system of checks and balances on state power, which was itself limited by decentralization. The idea of a contractual state embodied in texts like the Henrician Articles and the &quot;Pacta conventa&quot;; the concept of individual liberties; and the notion that the monarch owed duties to his subjects. This system, which primarily benefited the Polish nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;), came to be known as the &quot;nobles&#x27; democracy&quot;.

=== End of Golden Age ===
The 1791 Constitution was a response to the increasingly perilous situation in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which had been a major European power only a century earlier and was still the largest state on the continent. In the 1590s, at the peak of the nobles&#x27; democracy, King Sigismund III Vasa&#x27;s court preacherthe Jesuit Piotr Skargahad condemned the weaknesses of the Commonwealth. In the same period, writers and philosophers such as Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski and Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki, and the &quot;egzekucja praw&quot; (Execution-of-the-Laws) reform movement led by Jan Zamoyski had advocated political reforms. In 1656, in what came to be known as the Lwów Oath, Sigismund&#x27;s son King John II Casimir Vasa made a solemn vow on behalf of the entire Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that he would free the Polish peasants &quot;from the unjust burdens and oppression.&quot; As he was struggling with the Sejm, in 1661 John Casimirwhose reign saw highly destructive wars and obstructionism by the nobilitycorrectly predicted that the Commonwealth was in danger of a partition by Russia, Brandenburg and Austria.

As the Sejm failed to implement sufficient reforms, the state machinery became increasingly dysfunctional. A significant cause of the Commonwealth&#x27;s downfall was the &quot;liberum veto&quot; (&quot;free veto&quot;), which, since 1652, had allowed any Sejm deputy to nullify all the legislation enacted by that Sejm. As a result, deputies bribed by magnates or foreign powersprimarily from the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia and France, which had an ongoing revolutionor deputies who believed they were living in an unprecedented &quot;Golden Age&quot; paralysed the Commonwealth&#x27;s government for over a century. The threat of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; could only be overridden by the establishment of a &quot;confederated sejm&quot;, which was immune to the &quot;liberum veto&quot;. Declaring that a sejm either constituted a &quot;confederation&quot; or belonged to one was a contrivance prominently used by foreign interests in the 18th century to force a legislative outcome.

By the early 18th century, the magnates of Poland and Lithuania controlled the state, ensuring that no reforms that might weaken their privileged status (the &quot;Golden Freedoms&quot;) would be enacted. The ineffective monarchs who were elected to the Commonwealth throne in the early 18th century, Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland of the House of Wettin, did not improve matters. The Wettins, used to the absolute rule practiced in their native Saxony, tried to govern through intimidation and the use of force, which led to a series of conflicts between their supporters and opponentsincluding another pretender to the Polish throne, King Stanisław Leszczyński. Those conflicts often took the form of confederationslegal rebellions against the king permitted under the Golden Freedomsincluding the Warsaw Confederation (1704), Sandomierz Confederation, Tarnogród Confederation, Dzików Confederation and the War of the Polish Succession. Only 8 out of 18 Sejm sessions during the reign of Augustus II (1694–1733) passed legislation. For 30 years during the reign of Augustus III, only one session was able to pass legislation. The government was near collapse, giving rise to the term &quot;Polish anarchy&quot;, and the country was managed by provincial assemblies and magnates.

Other reform attempts in the Wettin era were led by individuals such as Stanisław Dunin-Karwicki, Stanisław A. Szczuka, Kazimierz Karwowski and Michał Józef Massalski; these mostly proved to be futile.

=== Early reforms ===
The Enlightenment greatly affected the thinking of influential Commonwealth circles during the reign (1764–95) of its last king, Stanisław II August Poniatowski. The King was an &quot;enlightened&quot; Polish magnate who had been a deputy to several Sejms between 1750 and 1764 and had a deeper understanding of Polish politics than previous monarchs. The Convocation Sejm of 1764, which elected Poniatowski to the throne, was controlled by the reformist Czartoryski &quot;Familia&quot; and was backed by Russian military forces invited by the Czartoryskis. In exchange for passing decrees favorable to them, the Russians and Prussians let the confederated Convocation Sejm enact a number of reforms, including the weakening of the &quot;liberum veto&quot; and its no longer applying to treasury and economic matters. A more comprehensive reform package was presented by Andrzej Zamoyski, but opposition from Prussia, Russia, and the Polish nobility thwarted this ambitious program, which had proposed deciding all motions by majority vote.

In part because his election had been imposed by Empress Catherine the Great, Poniatowski&#x27;s political position was weak from the start. He proceeded with cautious reforms, such as the establishment of fiscal and military ministries and the introduction of a national customs tariff, which was soon abandoned due to opposition from Prussia&#x27;s Frederick the Great. These measures had already been authorized by the Convocation Sejm; more legislative and executive improvements inspired by the &quot;Familia&quot; or the King were implemented during and after the 1764 Sejm.

The Commonwealth&#x27;s magnates viewed reform with suspicion and neighboring powers, content with the deterioration of the Commonwealth, abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on their borders. With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directlythe Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 and the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army had 200,000 each.

Russia&#x27;s Empress Catherine and Prussia&#x27;s King Frederick II provoked a conflict between members of the Sejm and the King over civil rights for religious minorities, such as Protestants and Greek Orthodox whose positions, which were guaranteed equal with the Catholic majority by the Warsaw Confederation of 1573, had worsened considerably. Catherine and Frederick declared their support for the &quot;szlachta&quot; and their &quot;liberties&quot;, and by October 1767 Russian troops had assembled outside Warsaw in support of the conservative Radom Confederation. The King and his adherents had little choice but to acquiesce to Russian demands. During the Repnin Sejm (named after the unofficially presiding Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin) the King accepted the five &quot;eternal and invariable principles&quot; which Catherine had vowed to &quot;protect for all time to come in the name of Poland&#x27;s liberties&quot;: the election of kings, the right of &quot;liberum veto&quot;, the right to renounce allegiance to and raise rebellion against the king (&quot;rokosz&quot;), the &quot;szlachta&quot; exclusive right to hold office and land, and landowners&#x27; power over their peasants. Thus all the privileges (&quot;Golden Freedoms&quot;) of the nobility that had made the Commonwealth ungovernable were guaranteed as unalterable in the Cardinal Laws. The Cardinal Laws and the rights of &quot;religious dissenters&quot; passed by the Repnin Sejm were personally guaranteed by Empress Catherine. By these acts of legislation, for the first time, Russia formally intervened in the Commonwealth&#x27;s constitutional affairs.

During the 1768 Sejm, Repnin showed his disregard for local resistance by arranging the abduction and imprisonment of Kajetan Sołtyk, Józef A. Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political rights of the religious minorities were restored and the need for more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.

King Stanisław August&#x27;s acquiescence to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On 29 February 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and his young son Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a confederation at the town of Bar. The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were overwhelmed by Russian intervention in 1772.

The defeat of the Bar Confederation set the scene for the partition treaty of 5 August 1772, which was signed at Saint Petersburg by Russia, Prussia, and Austria. The treaty divested the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth of about a third of its territory and populationover and 4 million people. The three powers justified their annexation, citing anarchy in the Commonwealth and its refusal to cooperate with its neighbors&#x27; efforts to restore order. King Stanisław August yielded and on 19 April 1773, he called the Sejm into session. Only 102 of about 200 deputies attended what became known as the Partition Sejm. The rest were aware of the King&#x27;s decision and refused. Despite protests from the deputy Tadeusz Rejtan and others, the treatylater known as the First Partition of Polandwas ratified.

The first of the three successive 18th-century partitions of Commonwealth territory that would eventually remove Poland&#x27;s sovereignty shocked the Commonwealth&#x27;s inhabitants and made it clear to progressive minds that the Commonwealth must either reform or perish. In the thirty years before the Constitution, there was a rising interest among progressive thinkers in constitutional reform. Before the First Partition, a Polish noble, Michał Wielhorski was sent to France by the Bar Confederation to ask the &quot;philosophes&quot; Gabriel Bonnot de Mably and Jean-Jacques Rousseau for their suggestions on a new constitution for a reformed Poland. Mably submitted his recommendations &quot;Du gouvernement et des lois en Pologne&quot; (&quot;The Government and Laws of Poland&quot;) in 1770–71, whereas Rousseau finished his &quot;Considerations on the Government of Poland&quot; in 1772 when the First Partition was already underway. Works advocating the need for reform and presenting specific solutions were published in the Commonwealth by Polish–Lithuanian thinkers: &quot;On an Effective Way of Councils or on the Conduct of Ordinary Sejms&quot; (1761–63), by Stanisław Konarski, founder of the Collegium Nobilium; &quot;Political Thoughts on Civil Liberties&quot; (1775) and &quot;Patriotic Letters&quot; (1778–78), by Józef Wybicki, author of the lyrics of the Polish National Anthem; (&quot;Anonymous Letters to Stanisław Małachowski&quot; (1788–89) and &quot;The Political Law of the Polish Nation&quot; (1790), by Hugo Kołłątaj, head of the Kołłątaj&#x27;s Forge party; and &quot;Remarks on the Life of Jan Zamoyski&quot; (1787), by Stanisław Staszic. Ignacy Krasicki&#x27;s satires of the Great Sejm era were also seen as crucial to giving the constitution moral and political support.

A new wave of reforms supported by progressive magnates such as the Czartoryski family and King Stanisław August were introduced at the Partition Sejm. The most important included the 1773 establishment of the Commission of National Education (&quot;Komisja Edukacji Narodowej&quot;)the first ministry of education in the world. New schools were opened, uniform textbooks were printed, teachers received better education and poor students were provided with scholarships. The Commonwealth&#x27;s military was to be modernized and funding to create a larger standing army was agreed. Economic and commercial reformsincluding some intended to cover the increased military budget previously shunned as unimportant by the &quot;szlachta&quot;were introduced. A new executive assembly, the 36-strong Permanent Council comprising five ministries with limited legislative powers, was established, giving the Commonwealth a governing body in constant session between Sejms and therefore immune to their &quot;liberum veto&quot; disruptions.

In 1776, the Sejm commissioned former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski to draft a new legal code. By 1780, he and his collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (&quot;Zbiór praw sądowych&quot;). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless &quot;szlachta&quot; of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski&#x27;s progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative &quot;szlachta&quot; and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.

== Constitution&#x27;s adoption ==

An opportunity for reform occurred during the &quot;Great Sejm&quot;also called the &quot;Four-Year Sejm&quot;of 1788–92, which began on 6 October 1788 with 181 deputies. In accordance with the Constitution&#x27;s preamble, from 1790 it met &quot;in dual number&quot; when 171 newly elected deputies joined the earlier-established Sejm. On its second day, the body became a confederated sejm to avoid the &quot;liberum veto&quot;. Concurrent world events appeared to have been opportune for the reformers. Russia and Austria were at war with the Ottoman Empire, and the Russians found themselves simultaneously fighting in the Russo-Swedish War, 1788–1790. A new alliance between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Prussia seemed to provide security against Russian intervention, and King Stanisław August drew closer to leaders of the reform-minded Patriotic Party.

The Sejm passed few major reforms in its first two years, but the subsequent two years brought more substantial changes. The Sejm adopted the 1791 Free Royal Cities Act, which was formally incorporated into the final constitution. This act addressed a number of matters related to the cities, crucially expanding burghers&#x27; (i.e., townspeople&#x27;s) rights, including electoral rights. While the Sejm comprised representatives of the nobility and clergy, the reformers were supported by the burghers, who in late 1789 organized in Warsaw a &quot;Black Procession&quot; demanding full political enfranchisement of the bourgeoisie. On 18 April 1791 the Sejmfearing that the burghers&#x27; protests, if ignored, could turn violent, as they had in France not long beforeadopted the Free Royal Cities Act.

The new constitution was drafted by the King, with contributions from Ignacy Potocki, Hugo Kołłątaj and others. The King is credited with writing the general provisions and Kołłątaj with giving the document its final shape. Stanisław August wanted the Commonwealth to become a constitutional monarchy similar to that of Great Britain, with a strong central government based on a strong monarch. Potocki wanted the &quot;Sejm&quot; to be the strongest branch of government. Kołłątaj wanted a &quot;gentle&quot; revolution, carried out without violence, to enfranchise other social classes in addition to the nobility.

The proposed reforms were opposed by the conservatives, including the Hetmans&#x27; Party. Threatened with violence by their opponents, the advocates of the draft began the debate on the Government Act two days early, while many opposing deputies were away on Easter recess. The debate and subsequent adoption of the Government Act was executed as a quasi-&quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. No recall notices were sent to known opponents of reform, while many pro-reform deputies secretly returned early. The royal guard under the command of the King&#x27;s nephew Prince Józef Poniatowski were positioned about the Royal Castle, where the Sejm was gathered, to prevent opponents from disrupting the proceedings. On 3 May, the Sejm convened with only 182 members, about half its &quot;dual&quot; number. The bill was read and overwhelmingly adopted, to the enthusiasm of the crowds outside. A protest was submitted the next day by a small group of deputies, but on 5 May the matter was officially concluded and protests were invalidated by the Constitutional Deputation of the Sejm. It was the first time in the 18th century that a constitutional act had been passed in the Commonwealth without the involvement of foreign powers.

Soon after, the Friends of the Constitution (&quot;Zgromadzenie Przyjaciół Konstytucji Rządowej&quot;)which included many participants in the Great Sejmwas organised to defend the reforms already enacted and to promote further ones. It is now regarded as the first modern-style political party in Poland&#x27;s history. The response to the new constitution was less enthusiastic in the provinces, where the Hetmans&#x27; Party enjoyed considerable influence. General support among the middle nobility was crucial and still very substantial; most of the provincial &quot;sejmiks&quot; deliberating in 1791 and early 1792 supported the constitution.

== Features ==

The Constitution of 3 May 1791 reflected Enlightenment influences, including Rousseau&#x27;s concept of the social contract and Montesquieu&#x27;s advocacy of a balance of powers among three branches of government—legislative, executive, and judicial—and of a bicameral legislature. As stated in Article V of the 3 May 1791 Constitution, the government was to ensure that &quot;the integrity of the states, civil liberty, and social order shall always remain in equilibrium.&quot; Jacek Jędruch writes that the liberality of the 3 May 1791 Constitution&#x27;s provisions &quot;fell somewhere below [that of] the French Constitution of 1791, above [that of the Canadas&#x27;] Constitutional Act of 1791, and left the [1794] General State Laws for the Prussian States far behind, but did not equal [that of] the American Constitution [that went into force in 1789].&quot; King Stanisław August Poniatowski was reported to have said that the 3 May 1791 Constitution was &quot;founded principally on those of England and the United States of America, but avoiding the faults and errors of both, and adapted as much as possible to the local and particular circumstances of the country.&quot; However, Polish historians report the Constitution as having been described as &quot;based mainly on the United States Constitution, but minus the latter&#x27;s flaws, and adapted to Poland&#x27;s circumstances.&quot; George Sanford writes that the Constitution of 3 May 1791 provided &quot;a constitutional monarchy close to the English model of the time.&quot;

Article I acknowledged the Roman Catholic faith as the &quot;dominant religion&quot; but guaranteed tolerance and freedom to all religions. It was less progressive than the 16th-century Warsaw Confederation, and placed Poland clearly within the Catholic sphere of influence. Article II confirmed many old privileges of the nobility, stressing that all nobles were equal and should enjoy personal security and the right to property. Article III stipulated that the earlier Free Royal Cities Act (&quot;Miasta Nasze Królewskie Wolne w Państwach Rzeczypospolitej&quot;), of 18 (or 21) April 1791, was integral to the Constitution. Personal security&quot;neminem captivabimus&quot;, the Polish version of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;was extended to townspeople (including Jews). Townspeople also gained the right to acquire landed property and became eligible for military officers&#x27; commissions and public offices, such as reserved seats in the Sejm and seats in the executive commissions of the Treasury, Police, and Judiciary. Membership in the nobility (&quot;szlachta&quot;) was also made easier for burghers to acquire.

With half a million burghers in the Commonwealth now substantially enfranchised, political power became more equally distributed. Little power was given to the less politically conscious or active classes, such as Jews and peasants. Article IV placed the Commonwealth&#x27;s peasantry under the protection of the national lawa first step toward enfranchising the country&#x27;s largest and most oppressed social class. Their low status compared to other classes was not eliminated, as the constitution did not abolish serfdom. The Second Partition and Kościuszko&#x27;s Proclamation of Połaniec in 1794 would later begin to abolish serfdom.

Article V stated that &quot;all power in civil society [should be] derived from the will of the people.&quot; The constitution referred to the country&#x27;s &quot;citizens&quot;, which for the first time included townspeople and peasants. The document&#x27;s preamble and 11 individual articles introduced the principle of popular sovereignty applied to the nobility and townspeople, and the separation of powers into legislative (a bicameral Sejm), executive (&quot;the King and the Guardians&quot;, the Guardians of the Laws being the newly established top governmental entity) and judicial branches. It advanced the democratization of the polity by limiting the excessive legal immunities and political prerogatives of landless nobility.

Legislative power, as defined in Article VI, rested with the bicameral parliament (an elected Sejm and an appointed Senate) and the king. The Sejm met every two years, and when required by national emergency. Its lower chamberthe Chamber of Deputies (&quot;Izba Poselska&quot;)had 204 deputies (2 from each &quot;powiat&quot;, 68 each from the provinces of Greater Poland, Lesser Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and 21 plenipotentiaries from royal cities (7 from each province). The royal chancellery was to inform the &quot;sejmiks&quot; of the legislation it intended to propose in advance, so deputies could prepare for the discussions. The Sejm&#x27;s upper chamberthe Chamber of Senators (&quot;Izba Senacka&quot;)had between 130 and 132 (sources vary) senators (voivodes, castellans, and bishops, as well as governments ministers without the right to vote). The king presided over the Senate and had one vote, which could be used to break ties. The king and all deputies had legislative initiative, and most mattersknown as &quot;general laws&quot;, and divided into constitutional, civil, criminal, and those for the institution of perpetual taxesrequired a simple majority, first from the lower chamber, then the upper. Specialized resolutions, including treaties of alliance, declarations of war and peace, ennoblements and increases in national debt, needed a majority of both chambers voting jointly. The Senate had a suspensive veto over laws that the Sejm passed, valid until the next Sejm session, when it could be overruled.

Article VI recognized the &quot;Prawo o sejmikach&quot;, the act on regional assemblies (&quot;sejmiks&quot;) passed on 24 March 1791. By reducing the enfranchisement of the noble classes, this law introduced major changes to the electoral ordinance. Previously, all nobles had been eligible to vote in &quot;sejmiks&quot;, which &quot;de facto&quot; meant that many of the poorest, landless noblesknown as &quot;clients&quot; or &quot;clientele&quot; of local magnatesvoted as the magnates bade them. Now right to vote was tied to a property qualification: one had to own or lease land and pay taxes, or be closely related to somebody who did, to vote. 300,000 of 700,000 previously eligible nobles were thus disfranchised. Voting rights were restored to landowners in military service. They had lost these rights in 1775. Voting was limited to men aged at least 18. The eligible voters elected deputies to local &quot;powiat&quot;s, or county sejmiks, which elected deputies to the General Sejm.

Finally, Article VI explicitly abolished several institutional sources of government weakness and national anarchy, including the &quot;liberum veto&quot;, confederations and confederated sejms, and the excessive influence of sejmiks stemming from the previously binding nature of their instructions to their Sejm deputies. The confederations were declared &quot;contrary to the spirit of this constitution, subversive of government and destructive of society.&quot; Thus the new constitution strengthened the powers of the Sejm, moving the country towards a constitutional monarchy.

Executive power, according to Article V and Article VII, was in the hands of &quot;the King in his council&quot;, a cabinet of ministers that was called the Guardians of the Laws (or Guard of the Laws, &quot;Straż Praw&quot;). The ministries could not create or interpret laws, and all acts of the foreign ministry were provisional and subject to Sejm approval. The King presided over his council, which comprised the Roman Catholic Primate of Polandwho was also president of the Education Commissionand five ministers appointed by the King: a minister of police, a minister of the seal (internal affairs), a minister of foreign affairs, a minister &quot;belli&quot; (of war), and a minister of treasury. Council members also includedwithout a votethe Crown Prince, the Marshal of the Sejm, and two secretaries. This royal council descended from similar councils that had functioned since King Henry&#x27;s Articles (1573), and from the recent Permanent Council. Acts of the King required the countersignature of the pertinent minister. A minister was required to countersign a law, unless all other ministers endorsed his objection to that law. In that case, the King could withdraw the law or press the issue by presenting it to parliament. The stipulation that the King, &quot;doing nothing of himself, ... shall be answerable for nothing to the nation,&quot; parallels the British constitutional principle that &quot;The King can do no wrong.&quot; (In both countries, the pertinent minister was responsible for the King&#x27;s acts.) The ministers were responsible to the Sejm, which could dismiss them by a two-thirds vote of no confidence of both houses. Ministers could also be held accountable by the Sejm Court, where a simple-majority vote sufficed to impeach a minister. The King was the nation&#x27;s commander-in-chief; there is no mention of &quot;hetman&quot;s (the previous highest-ranking military commanders). The King had the right to grant pardons, except in cases of treason. The royal council&#x27;s decisions were implemented by commissions, whose members were elected by the Sejm.


The Constitution changed the government from an elective to a hereditary monarchy. This provision was intended to reduce the destructive influence of foreign powers at each election. The royal dynasty was elective, and if one were to cease, a new family would be chosen by the nation. The king reigned by the &quot;grace of God and the will of the Nation&quot;, and &quot;all authority derives from the will of the Nation.&quot; The institution of pacta conventa was preserved. On Stanisław August&#x27;s death the Polish throne would become hereditary and pass to Frederick Augustus III of Saxony of the House of Wettin, which had provided the two kings before Stanisław August. This provision was contingent upon Frederic Augustus&#x27; consent. He declined when Adam Czartoryski offered him the throne.

Discussed in Article VIII, the judiciary was separated from the two other branches of the government, and was to be served by elective judges. Courts of first instance existed in each voivodeship and were in constant session, with judges elected by the regional sejmik assemblies. Appellate tribunals were established for the provinces, based on the reformed Crown Tribunal and Lithuanian Tribunal. The Sejm elected from its deputies the judges for the Sejm Court, a precursor to the modern State Tribunal of Poland. Referendary courts were established in each province to hear the cases of the peasantry. Municipal courts, described in the law on towns, complemented this system.

Article IX covered procedures for regency, which should be taken up jointly by the council of the Guardians, headed by the Queen, or in her absence by the Primate. Article X stressed the importance of education of royal children and tasked the Commission of National Education with this responsibility. The last article of the constitution, Article XI, concerned the national standing army. Said army was defined as a &quot;defensive force&quot; dedicated &quot;solely to the nation&#x27;s defense.&quot; The army was to be increased in strength to 100,000 men.

To further enhance the Commonwealth&#x27;s integration and security, the Constitution abolished the erstwhile union of Poland and Lithuania in favor of a unitary state. Its full establishment, supported by Stanisław August and Kołlątaj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies. As a compromise, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania received numerous privileges guaranteeing its continued existence. Related acts included the Declaration of the Assembled Estates (&quot;Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych&quot;) of 5 May 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Mutual Pledge of the Two Nations (&quot;Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów&quot;), i.e., of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, of 22 October 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and Lithuania within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Mutual Pledge strengthened the Polish–Lithuanian union while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.
The manuscript in Lithuanian language of the Constitution was made and it was also later published in English-, French-, and German-language editions.

The Constitution provided for potential amendments, which were to be addressed at an extraordinary Sejm to be held every 25 years.

The Constitution remained to the last a work in progress. The Government Act was fleshed out in a number of laws passed in May and June 1791: on sejm courts (two acts of 13 May), the Guardians of the Laws (1 June), the national police commission (a ministry, 17 June), and municipal administration (24 June).

The Constitution&#x27;s co-author Hugo Kołłątaj announced that work was underway on &quot;an economic constitution ... guaranteeing all rights of property [and] securing protection and honor to all manner of labor ...&quot; A third planned basic law was mentioned by Kołłątaj: a &quot;moral constitution&quot;, most likely a Polish analog to the United States Bill of Rights and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Constitution called for the preparation of a new civil and criminal code, tentatively called the Stanisław August Code. The King also planned a reform improving the situation of the Jews.

== Aftermath: war and final two Partitions ==
The constitutional formal procedures were performed for little over a year before being stopped by Russian armies allied with conservative Polish nobility in the Polish–Russian War of 1792, also known as the War in Defense of the Constitution. With the wars between Turkey and Russia and Sweden and Russia having ended, Empress Catherine was furious over the adoption of the document, which she believed threatened Russian influence in Poland. Russia had viewed Poland as a &quot;de facto&quot; protectorate. &quot;The worst possible news have arrived from Warsaw: the Polish king has become almost sovereign&quot; was the reaction of one of Russia&#x27;s chief foreign policy authors, Alexander Bezborodko, when he learned of the new constitution. The contacts of Polish reformers with the Revolutionary French National Assembly were seen by Poland&#x27;s neighbors as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy and a threat to the absolute monarchies. The Prussian statesman Ewald von Hertzberg expressed the fears of European conservatives: &quot;The Poles have given the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; to the Prussian monarchy by voting a constitution&quot;, elaborating that a strong Commonwealth would likely demand return of the lands that Prussia had acquired in the First Partition.

Magnates who had opposed the constitution draft from the start, Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki, Seweryn Rzewuski, and Szymon and Józef Kossakowski, asked Tsarina Catherine to intervene and restore their privilegesthe Cardinal Laws abolished under the new statute. To that end these magnates formed the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation&#x27;s proclamation, prepared in St. Petersburg in January 1792, criticized the constitution for contributing to &quot;contagion of democratic ideas&quot; following &quot;the fatal examples set in Paris.&quot; It asserted that &quot;The parliament ... has broken all fundamental laws, swept away all liberties of the gentry and on the third of May 1791 turned into a revolution and a conspiracy.&quot; The Confederates declared an intention to overcome this revolution. We &quot;can do nothing but turn trustingly to Tsarina Catherine, a distinguished and fair empress, our neighboring friend and ally&quot;, who &quot;respects the nation&#x27;s need for well-being and always offers it a helping hand&quot;, they wrote.

Russian armies entered Poland and Lithuania, starting the Polish–Russian War of 1792. The Sejm voted to increase the army of the Commonwealth to 100,000 men, but owing to insufficient time and funds this number was never achieved and soon abandoned even as a goal. The Polish King and the reformers could field only a 37,000-man army, many of them untested recruits. This army, under the command of Józef Poniatowski and Tadeusz Kościuszko, defeated or fought to a draw the Russians on several occasions, but in the end, a defeat loomed inevitable. Despite Polish requests, Prussia refused to honor its alliance obligations. Stanisław August&#x27;s attempts at negotiations with Russia proved futile. As the front lines kept shifting to the west and in July 1792 Warsaw was threatened with siege by the Russians, the King came to believe that victory was impossible against the numerically superior enemy, and that surrender was the only alternative to total defeat. Having received assurances from the Russian ambassador Yakov Bulgakov that no territorial changes will occur, the Guardians of the Laws cabinet voted 8:4 to surrender. On 24 July 1792, King Stanisław August Poniatowski joined the Targowica Confederation, as the Empress had demanded. The Polish Army disintegrated.

Many reform leaders, believing their cause was for now lost, went into self-imposed exile. Some hoped that Stanisław August would be able to negotiate an acceptable compromise with the Russians, as he had done in the past. But the King had not saved the Commonwealth and neither had the Targowica Confederates, who governed the country for a short while. To their surprise, the Grodno Sejm, bribed or intimidated by the Russian troops, enacted the Second Partition of Poland. On 23 November 1793, it concluded its deliberations under duress, annulling the constitution and acceding to the Second Partition. Russia took , while Prussia took . The Commonwealth now comprised no more than . What was left of the Commonwealth was merely a small buffer state with a puppet king, and Russian garrisons keeping an eye on the reduced Polish army.

For a year and a half, Polish patriots waited while planning an insurrection. On 24 March 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared what has come to be known as the Kościuszko Uprising. On 7 May, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (&quot;Uniwersał Połaniecki&quot;), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (4 April), the capture of Warsaw (18 April) and the Wilno (22 April)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising&#x27;s defeat to have been a foregone conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Kościuszko&#x27;s forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.

=== Historic importance ===
The Constitution of 3 May 1791 has been both idealized, and criticized for either not going far enough or being too radical. As its provisions remained in force for only 18 months and 3 weeks, its influence was, in any case, limited. However, for generations, the memory of the Constitutionrecognized by political scientists as a progressive document for its timehelped keep alive Polish aspirations for an independent and just society, and continued to inform the efforts of its authors&#x27; descendants. Bronisław Dembiński, a Polish constitutional scholar, wrote a century later that &quot;The miracle of the Constitution did not save the state but did save the nation.&quot; In Poland the Constitution is mythologized and viewed as a national symbol and as the culmination of the Enlightenment in Polish history and culture. In the words of two of its authors, Ignacy Potocki and Hugo Kołłątaj, it was &quot;the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland.&quot; Since Poland&#x27;s recovery of independence in 1918, the 3 May anniversary of the Constitution&#x27;s adoption has been observed as the country&#x27;s most important civil holiday.

The 3 May Constitution was a milestone in the history of law and in the growth of democracy. The 18th-century Irish statesman Edmund Burke described it as &quot;the noblest benefit received by any nation at any time ... Stanislas II has earned a place among the greatest kings and statesmen in history.&quot; The 3 May Constitution was the first to follow the 1788 ratification of the United States Constitution. Poland and the United States, though geographically distant from each other, showed similar approaches to the designing of political systems. The 3 May Constitution has been called the second constitution in world history. Constitutional-law expert Albert Blaustein calls it the &quot;world&#x27;s second national constitution&quot;, and Bill Moyers writes that it was &quot;Europe&#x27;s first codified national constitution (and the second oldest in the world).&quot; Historian Norman Davies calls it &quot;the first constitution of its type in Europe.&quot; The 3 May Constitution and the Great Sejm that adopted it have been the subjects of a large body of works by Polish scholars, starting with the still often cited 19th-century works of Walerian Kalinka and Władysław Smoleński, and continued in the 20th century by Bogusław Leśnodorski.

The document&#x27;s official name was &quot;Ustawa Rządowa&quot; (&quot;Government Act&quot;), where &quot;government&quot; referred to the political system. In the Commonwealth, the term &quot;constitution&quot; (Polish: &quot;konstytucja&quot;) had previously denoted all the legislation, of whatever character, that had been passed by a given Sejm.

=== Holiday ===

3 May was declared a Polish holiday (Constitution Day&quot;Święto Konstytucji 3 Maja&quot;) on 5 May 1791. The holiday was banned during the partitions of Poland but reinstated in April 1919 under the Second Polish Republicthe first holiday officially introduced in the newly independent country. It was again outlawed during World War II by both the Nazi and Soviet occupiers. It was celebrated in Polish cities in May 1945, although in a mostly spontaneous manner. The 1946 anti-communist demonstrations did not endear it to the Polish communists, and it competed for attention with the communist-endorsed 1 May Labor Day celebrations in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic; this led to its &quot;rebranding&quot; as Democratic Party Day and removal from the list of national holidays by 1951. Until 1989, 3 May was a frequent occasion for anti-government and anti-communist protests. 3 May was restored as an official Polish holiday in April 1990 after the fall of communism. Polish-American pride has been celebrated on the same date, for instance in Chicago, where since 1982 Poles have marked it with festivities and the annual Polish Constitution Day Parade.

<text>The Kama ( , ; ; ), also known as the Chulman ( ; ), is a long river in Russia. It has a drainage basin of . It is the longest left tributary of the Volga and the largest one in discharge. At their confluence, in fact, the Kama is even larger in terms of discharge than the Volga.

It starts in the Udmurt Republic, near Kuliga, flowing northwest for , turning northeast near Loyno for another , then turning south and west in Perm Krai, flowing again through the Udmurt Republic and then through the Republic of Tatarstan, where it meets the Volga south of Kazan.

Before the advent of railroads, important portages connected the Kama with the basins of the Northern Dvina and the Pechora. In the early 19th-century the Northern Ekaterininsky Canal connected the upper Kama with the Vychegda River (a tributary of the Northern Dvina), but was mostly abandoned after just a few years due to low use.

The Kama featured in the 2013 Russian film &quot;The Geographer Drank His Globe Away&quot;, in the climactic rapids scene.

==Dams and reservoirs==
The Kama is dammed at several locations:
*At Perm, by the dam of the Kama Hydroelectric Station, forming the Kama Reservoir;
*At Chaykovsky, by the dam of the Votkinsk Hydroelectric Station, forming the Votkinsk Reservoir;
*At Naberezhnye Chelny, by the dam of the Nizhnekamsk Hydroelectric Station, forming the Nizhnekamsk Reservoir.

==Tributaries==

The largest tributaries of the Kama are, from source to mouth:

==Volga or Kama==

Even today, disputes over the primacy of the rivers continue: Volga or Kama? Scientific facts say that the Volga flows into the Kama, and not vice versa. The confluence of the Volga and the Kama has exactly the same water content (Volga: 3,500 m3/s; Kama: 4,100 m3/s). The source of the Volga (228 m) is below the source of the Kama (331 m), which is the main factor in determining the superiority of any river. Compared to the Kama basin (507,000 km2), the Volga has a larger basin (604,000 km2). More rivers flow into the Kama than the Volga. Experts have proven that the valley of the Kama River is more ancient than the Volga River valley. In other words, at the time of the existence of the ancient Kama, also known as the Paleo-Kama, there was no Volga. Later, geological changes caused the Volga to join the Kama at right angles. Also looking at the map, we can understand that the confluence of the Kama and the Volga is the continuation of the Kama canal. The bed of the Kama is lower, so the Volga clearly flows into the Kama.

<text>Klubi i Futbollit Teuta, commonly referred to as &quot;Teuta&quot;, is an Albanian professional football club based in Durrës. The club competes in the Kategoria Superiore, the top tier of Albanian football. Their home ground is the Niko Dovana Stadium.

The club was founded on 29 January 1920 as &quot;Klubi Sportiv Urani&quot; (Uranium Sport Club), and they were a founding member of the Albanian National Championship in 1930, as well as runners-up in the 1931 National Championship. They have won the Kategoria Superiore twice in 1994 and in 2021, and they have also won the Albanian Cup four times, as well as finishing runners-up in three Albanian Supercups.

==History==
===Early years===
The club was founded on 29 January 1920 as Klubi Sportiv Urani, which literally translates to Uranium Sport Club, and they changed their name to &quot;Sport Klub Durrës&quot; just two years later 1922. They kept the same name until they joined the Albania national championship as one of the original six members alongside SK Tiranë, Skënderbeu Korçë, Bashkimi Shkodran, Urani Elbasan and Sportklub Vlorë. In 1930, before entering the National Championship, the club changes its name to the &quot;Klubi Sportiv Teuta Durrës&quot;, in reference to Queen Teuta of Illyria. In the first national championship they finished fifth out of six teams, collecting three wins and two draws out of ten games. The following season they finished as runners-up in the league, as they lost 4–1 in the championship final against SK Tiranë, where the club&#x27;s goalkeeper Niko Dovana famously scored the equaliser in the first leg which ended in a 1–1 draw.

After Communism took control of Albania the club was forced to change its name to &quot;KS Ylli i Kuq Durrës&quot;, literally meaning KS Red Star Durrës. Just 3 years later in 1950 the club dropped KS Red Star Durrës from its name and was simply called SK Durrës once again, before renaming to &quot;SK Puna Durrës&quot; a 1-year later in 1951. The club changed its name again in 1958 to &quot;KS Lokomotiva Durrës&quot; which they kept until the fall of Communism in Albania in 1991. Since 1991 the club has renamed KS Teuta Durrës, with the football team being called KF Teuta.

===Hasanbelliu era===
In 1999 local businessman and owner of Eurotech Cement Edmond Hasanbelliu he was named as the new president of the club, he brought in Hasan Lika as manager immediately. He began investing in the club and introduced Albanian internationals Sokol Prenga and Suad Liçi in the club, alongside a host of other players including Orges Shehi and Arjan Sheta. In the club&#x27;s first season under Hasan Lika and Edmond Hasanbelliu they finished in third place, behind Tomori Berat and eventual winners KF Tirana. They also had a successful Albanian Cup run as they eliminated Flamurtari Vlorë, KF Tirana and Dinamo Tirana to reach the final against KS Lushnja, which ended 0–0 after extra time and Teuta won the game 5–4 on penalties. They qualified for the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup in the following season, where they faced Austrian side SK Rapid Wien. They were eliminated following a 6–0 aggregate loss, after 4–0 and 2–0 losses.

===Recent years===
In November 2013 the president Hasanbelliu announced that the club had sold a 50% stake to Swiss company Gea Sport, who promised investment in the club in order to achieve domestic success as well as have good runs in Europe. The firm&#x27;s first action as shareholders was to replace the Albanian coach Gugash Magani with the Italian Roberto Sorrentino, who became the club&#x27;s first ever foreign coach. Following less than 2 months as shareholders Gea Sport were instrumental in bringing in 11 players during the January transfer window, most of which were foreigners, in an attempt to push for the title. On 24 February 2014, Sorrentino was fired as the first team coach following a string of poor results. The club announced the appointment of Ilir Daja the day after Sorrentino&#x27;s departure.

==Stadium==
The club play their home games at the Niko Dovana Stadium which was built in 1965 and currently has a capacity of around 13,000. The stadium was previously known as the Lokomotiva Stadium between 1958 and 1991 during Communism while the club was named Lokomotiva Durrës. The stadium has also been host to the Albania national team in 2010 where they played a friendly against Uzbekistan. During the 2013–14 season, according to the club&#x27;s official website the average league attendance was 2,638.

<text>Alphaville is a German synthpop band formed in Münster in 1982. They gained popularity in the 1980s. The group was founded by singers Marian Gold, Bernhard Lloyd, and Frank Mertens. They achieved chart success with the singles &quot;Forever Young&quot;, &quot;Big in Japan&quot;, &quot;Sounds Like a Melody&quot;, &quot;The Jet Set&quot;, and &quot;Dance with Me&quot;. Gold remains the only continuous original member of Alphaville. They took their name from Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s film &quot;Alphaville&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
Alphaville was formed after lead singer Marian Gold and Bernhard Lloyd met in West Berlin in 1981. The pair were heavily influenced by UK indie acts like Tubeway Army, Gary Numan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD). Gold had written &quot;Big in Japan&quot; in 1979 after hearing the music of Holly Johnson&#x27;s band Big in Japan. They first named their band &quot;Forever Young&quot; and subsequently changed it to &quot;Alphaville&quot; after the 1965 science fiction film. Together the three wrote and recorded &quot;Forever Young&quot; as a demo. The first Alphaville concert took place on 31 December 1982 in Enger, Westphalia. 

In 1984, the newly renamed Alphaville released their debut single, &quot;Big in Japan&quot;. In the early years, Gold said that &quot;none of us could really play an instrument. The music was in our heads, but we were dependent on synthesizers and drum machines and things like that. ... The equipment we had at that time was basically toys – the cheapest monophonic synthesizers you could imagine. We had a little studio in a basement, made a couple of demos and sent them to some record companies to try to get a deal. We didn&#x27;t have much hope, but we had three offers and from that moment everything happened very fast.&quot;

===&quot;Forever Young&quot; (1984)===

In autumn 1984, they released their debut album, &quot;Forever Young&quot;, produced by Colin Pearson, Wolfgang Loos and Andreas Budde.

&quot;Big in Japan&quot; topped the charts in West Germany, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, Turkey, Venezuela, and the US Billboard Dance Chart (the group&#x27;s only Top 10 on any Billboard chart). The single also reached the Top Five in the Netherlands, Norway, Austria, Ireland and South Africa. It became the group&#x27;s only Top 20 single in the UK, peaking at No. 8.

The band&#x27;s next two singles, &quot;Sounds Like a Melody&quot; and &quot;Forever Young&quot;, were also both European Top 5 successes, although the former track failed to make an impression on the American charts.

Amid reports that pop star Laura Branigan was featuring the song on her next album, &quot;Hold Me&quot;, Alphaville&#x27;s &quot;Forever Young&quot; was re-released as a single in the US. The Alphaville version was released a third time in the US in 1988, to promote &quot;Alphaville: The Singles Collection&quot;, and peaked at No. 65, their highest charting (and also last) single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

Despite the success of the album and its singles, the band did not tour. Said Gold, &quot;we didn&#x27;t feel we were good enough musicians [to tour]. These days it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem to go out and play with tracks, but at that time it was really complicated. We didn&#x27;t feel like we were performers. We felt more like we were studio rats. The studio felt like a safe environment. So, much to the annoyance of our manager, we didn&#x27;t play [live] very much.&quot;

Despite their commercial success in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, Alphaville has never performed live in the UK. Soon after the success of the album, Mertens left the band in December 1984. He was replaced in January 1985 by Ricky Echolette on keyboard and guitar.

In a 2022 interview, Marian Gold said it is &quot;a bit of a shock&quot; when he hears Forever Young playing when he is in an elevator or at the supermarket.

===&quot;Afternoons in Utopia&quot; (1986) ===

In 1986, their second album, &quot;Afternoons in Utopia&quot;, was released and its first single &quot;Dance With Me&quot; was a Top 20 hit in Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa and in remix form on the US Hot Maxi Singles chart. It reached the Top 30 in Austria, Italy and in the US Club Play chart. The album&#x27;s second single was &quot;Universal Daddy&quot;. For their third single, the band released &quot;Jerusalem&quot; in Germany only, while they went with &quot;Sensations&quot; for Austria, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. The final single from &quot;Afternoons in Utopia&quot; was &quot;Red Rose&quot;, in 1987.

===&quot;The Breathtaking Blue&quot; (1989)===

Their third album in 1989, &quot;The Breathtaking Blue&quot;, included the singles &quot;Romeos&quot; and &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot; and was released as a CD+G, including black &amp; white stills with original lyrics and German translation. As an alternative to individual music videos, the band enlisted nine directors, among them Godfrey Reggio (&quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;), to create a film entitled &quot;Songlines&quot; based on the album&#x27;s tracks.

=== &quot;Prostitute&quot; (1994) ===

The next album, &quot;Prostitute&quot;, was not released until 1994. The first single released was &quot;Fools&quot;, followed by the second and last single from the album, &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;. During the tour for this album Robbie France briefly joined the band on drums. In 1997, after the band went to record their next album, Echolette left the band because he decided to spend time with his family.

=== &quot;Salvation&quot; (1997) ===

&quot;Salvation&quot; followed in 1997. A limited edition box-set, Dreamscapes, was issued in 1999. In 2000 &quot;Stark Naked and Absolutely Live&quot; was released. In 2001, the remix album &quot;Forever Pop&quot; and a DVD entitled &quot;Little America&quot; of two concerts performed in Salt Lake City, Utah. Bernhard Lloyd did not contribute to the second limited edition box-set, the 2003 &quot;CrazyShow&quot;, and shortly after its release on 18 March 2003, he officially left the group; however, he stays in contact with Gold. The core stage members of Alphaville then were Gold and new recruits, Martin Lister (keyboards), David Goodes (guitars) and Jakob Kiersch (drums).

===&quot;Catching Rays on Giant&quot; (2010)===

On 19 November 2010 the album &quot;Catching Rays on Giant&quot;, the first commercial studio album in 13 years was released and entered the German album charts at number 9 in its first week. The touring musicians became members of the band at this point. The second single from the album was the track, &quot;Song for No One&quot;, released on 4 March 2011. The band held an album release party, where they played a short unplugged set, at the Quasimodo Club in Berlin on the evening of 18 November 2010 to which their closest fans and friends were invited. The album featured band member Martin Lister on lead vocals for the track, &quot;Call Me Down&quot;. In 2011 Maja Kim joined the band on bass.

The first single and album releases were available at first only in Germany and through online shops and download platforms in German-speaking countries. The first single from album was titled &quot;I Die for You Today&quot;, available as a digital download on 8 October 2010, released in CD format on 22 October 2010. It entered the German charts at number 15 in its first week of release and stayed in the top 100 for 8 weeks. In March 2011 Alphaville toured the album across Germany and had signed a new deal with the Universal Music Group.

On 21 May 2014, Martin Lister died unexpectedly, announced by the band via their Facebook page and Yahoo mailing list, a few days later. He was replaced by Carsten Brocker. In 2016, bassist Maja Kim left in order to follow new challenges, with the position filled by Alexandra Merl.

===&quot;Strange Attractor&quot; (2017)===

&quot;Strange Attractor&quot; was released on 7 April 2017 after an extremely long production time, with a video for the single &quot;Heartbreak City&quot;. In August 2017, they performed a Concert Tour in Houston, New York City, Chicago, and San Jose and Burbank, California.

===2018–present: Collaboration and &quot;Eternally Yours&quot;===
For the 35th anniversary of the group in 2018, Alphaville held a concert on 25 and 26 May at the Whisky A Go-Go club in Los Angeles, California. In 2019, the LA Concert Group issued a limited box set recording of this show containing five CDs, two DVDs and two Blu-ray discs.

In 2021, Alphaville teamed up with Schiller and released a new version of &quot;Summer in Berlin&quot; as Schiller x Alphaville.

On 7 February 2022, Gold announced a symphonic album of Alphaville songs to be released by the end of 2022, supported by the release of three singles over the course of the year. &quot;Big in Japan&quot; was released on 29 April as the first song from the album. On 11 June, &quot;Sounds Like a Melody&quot; was released as the second song from the album, now titled &quot;Eternally Yours.&quot; &quot;Dance With Me&quot; was revealed to be the third song on 27 July, as part of a podcast presented by Gold and his daughter Lily Becker. &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; released on 23 September 2022, containing new symphonic versions of sixteen Alphaville songs, plus a new song also titled &quot;Eternally Yours&quot;.

==Projects==
Gold has released two solo albums (&quot;So Long Celeste&quot;, 1992, and &quot;United&quot;, 1996, both mixing personal creations and covers), alongside his work in the band.

Lloyd also worked on a project named &quot;Atlantic Popes&quot; with singer Max Holler, releasing a 13-track CD.

Alphaville participated in Night of the Proms in 2002, performing &quot;Big in Japan&quot; and &quot;Forever Young&quot;. Gold also contributed to a group performance of &quot;Let It Be&quot; with other performers at the event.

On 25–26 May 2018, Alphaville and Marian Gold played two nights at the Whisky a Go Go club in Hollywood. The two concerts were also live streamed.

On 15 March 2019, the album &quot;Forever Young&quot; was remastered for the 35th anniversary.

On 7 May 2021, the albums &quot;Afternoons in Utopia&quot; and &quot;The Breathtaking Blue&quot; was remastered after the successful reissue of the album &quot;Forever Young&quot;.

To support the upcoming release of the symphonic album &quot;Eternally Yours&quot; in 2022, Gold and his daughter Lily Becker began a podcast discussing Alphaville songs and the album.

==Legacy==

Alphaville&#x27;s song &quot;Forever Young&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Listen to Me&quot; (1989) featuring Kirk Cameron in one of his first film roles. &quot;Forever Young&quot; was played in a high school prom-related scene in the 2004 film &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot;. &quot;Forever Young&quot; was also featured in the Canadian movie &quot;1987&quot; (2014), as well as a 2014 episode of &quot;Regular Show&quot;, Skip&#x27;s Story.

In 2006, Australian guitar band Youth Group took their remake of &quot;Forever Young&quot; to No. 1 in the Official Australian Charts.

&quot;Young Forever&quot; is the fourth single by American hip hop rapper Jay-Z from his album &quot;The Blueprint 3&quot; on the Roc Nation label. It is a mild rework of Alphaville&#x27;s 1984 song &quot;Forever Young&quot;: the original melody is retained, Mr Hudson sings the original lyrics (primarily during the chorus), and Jay-Z raps in place of the verses.

<doc id="463493" wikidata="Q2520763" url="?curid=463493" title="Cathedral of the Divine Saviour">
<text>Cathedral of the Divine Saviour (), located in the center of Ostrava, is the second largest Roman Catholic cathedral in Moravia and Silesia (after the basilica in Velehrad near Uherské Hradiště). This three-nave Neo-Renaissance basilica with a semi-circular apse and two 67m high towers is dating since 1889 (building started in 1883). The church was designed by Gustav Meretta, the official architect of the Archbishop of Olomouc, and the interior by Max von Ferstel.

The main nave is 14 m wide and 22 m high, the two side aisles are 7 m wide and 10 m high each. The seating capacity of the cathedral is 4,000 people. On May 30, 1996, Pope John Paul II established the Diocese of Ostrava-Opava, and soon after the basilica has been dignified into a cathedral. In 1998, a new neo-Baroque organ was installed.

==History==
On 23 May 1871 the city council spoke about the intention of building a new parish church, which would eventually replace the old parish church of St Wenceslas. The old church could not contain the increasing number of believers and failed to comply with official requirements for public buildings. After a fire inspection took place on 2 January 1882, the district marshal in Místek decided to build a new church. Thus, at a council meeting on 5 October 1882 the agreements for the construction of a new parish church were done. 
The foundation stone was laid by Mayor Anton Lux and the Reverend Josef Spurný on October 4, 1883. AT that time church committees were competing in Moravia which was established under provincial laws dating from 1864 and 1874. It was the supervisory and executive bodies, which were often the purchaser of furniture projects and new churches, significantly encroached into their final form. Their arguments focused, in particular, on situations where the parish volume was small. The church of the Divine Saviour would serve 4 municipalities which, upon its construction, should contribute a proportionate financial amount. However, these villages managed their own parish church and, therefore Ostravanians&#x27; contributions to the construction of the church were often the cause of discord. Other financial flow was rather paradoxical. The Archdiocese of Olomouc, who took patronage of the church, was obliged, by patronage law, to pay a third of construction costs, worth just under 33,000 florins. Contributions also flowed in from Jewish entrepreneurs, like Baron Rotschild and the Gutmannové brothers.

<text>dvips is a computer program that converts the Device Independent file format (DVI) output of TeX typography into a printable or otherwise presentable form. was written by Tomas Rokicki to produce printable PostScript files from DVI input, and is now commonly used for general DVI conversion.

The TeX typesetting system outputs DVI files which are intended to be independent of the output device. In particular, they are not understood by printers and lack information such as font shapes. Thus, a converter (i.e., a backend) is needed to translate from a DVI file to a printer language. Although other DVI backends such as dvilj exist, is one of the most common ways of printing DVI files. Another, more recent solution is the use of pdfTeX to directly generate PDF files, which have readers for most platforms. Given its importance, is a standard part of most TeX distributions, such as teTeX, and TeX Live.

By using TeX codice_1 commands, it is possible to directly insert &quot;literal PostScript&quot; into the DVI file and have such snippets of PostScript appear in the final file generated by . This flexibility allows the user to include, say, watermarks on his document (especially via the use of proper packages) or further postprocess the PostScript file.

When producing postscript files, dvips embeds fonts inside the file. Most recent distributions will normally embed scalable fonts, also known as Type 1 fonts. Files generated with older distributions, however, may embed raster fonts. To substitute raster for scalable fonts in a postscript file in a situation where the original dvi file is unavailable use a utility called pkfix.

<doc id="463501" wikidata="Q1349821" url="?curid=463501" title="Hepatotoxicity">
<text>Hepatotoxicity (from &quot;hepatic toxicity&quot;) implies chemical-driven liver damage. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a cause of acute and chronic liver disease caused specifically by medications and the most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market after approval.

The liver plays a central role in transforming and clearing chemicals and is susceptible to the toxicity from these agents. Certain medicinal agents, when taken in overdoses (e.g. acetaminophen, paracetamol) and sometimes even when introduced within therapeutic ranges (e.g. halothane), may injure the organ. Other chemical agents, such as those used in laboratories and industries, natural chemicals (e.g., alpha-amanitin), and herbal remedies (two prominent examples being kava, though the causal mechanism is unknown, and comfrey, through pyrrolizidine alkaloid content) can also induce hepatotoxicity. Chemicals that cause liver injury are called hepatotoxins.

More than 900 drugs have been implicated in causing liver injury (see LiverTox, external link, below) and it is the most common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market. Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury also account for a substantial number of compound failures, highlighting the need for toxicity prediction models (e.g. DTI), and drug screening assays, such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process. Chemicals often cause subclinical injury to the liver, which manifests only as abnormal liver enzyme tests.

Drug-induced liver injury is responsible for 5% of all hospital admissions and 50% of all acute liver failures.

== Causes ==
Adverse drug reactions are classified as type A (intrinsic or pharmacological) or type B (idiosyncratic). Type A drug reaction accounts for 80% of all toxicities.

Drugs or toxins that have a pharmacological (type A) hepatotoxicity are those that have &quot;predictable&quot; dose-response curves (higher concentrations cause more liver damage) and well characterized mechanisms of toxicity, such as directly damaging liver tissue or blocking a metabolic process. As in the case of paracetamol overdose, this type of injury occurs shortly after some threshold for toxicity is reached. Carbon tetrachloride is commonly used to induce acute type A liver injury in animal models.

Idiosyncratic (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause &quot;non-predictable&quot; hepatotoxicity in susceptible individuals, which is not related to dose and has a variable latency period. This type of injury does not have a clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; Troglitazone (Rezulin) and trovafloxacin (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.

The herb kava has caused a number of cases of idiosyncratic liver injury, ranging everywhere from asymptomatic to fatal.

Oral use of the antifungal ketoconazole has been associated with hepatic toxicity, including some fatalities; however, such effects appear to be limited to doses taken over a period longer than 7 days.

===Paracetamol===
Paracetamol also known as acetaminophen, and by the brand names of Tylenol and Panadol, is usually well-tolerated in prescribed dose, but overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced liver disease and acute liver failure worldwide. Damage to the liver is not due to the drug itself but to a toxic metabolite (&quot;N&quot;-acetyl-&quot;p&quot;-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI)) produced by cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver. In normal circumstances, this metabolite is detoxified by conjugating with glutathione in phase 2 reaction. In an overdose, a large amount of NAPQI is generated, which overwhelms the detoxification process and leads to liver cell damage. Nitric oxide also plays a role in inducing toxicity. The risk of liver injury is influenced by several factors including the dose ingested, concurrent alcohol or other drug intake, interval between ingestion and antidote, etc. The dose toxic to the liver is quite variable from person to person and is often thought to be lower in chronic alcoholics. Measurement of blood level is important in assessing prognosis, higher levels predicting a worse prognosis. Administration of Acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, can limit the severity of the liver damage by capturing the toxic NAPQI. Those that develop acute liver failure can still recover spontaneously, but may require transplantation if poor prognostic signs such as encephalopathy or coagulopathy is present (see King&#x27;s College Criteria).

=== Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ===
Although individual analgesics rarely induce liver damage due to their widespread use, NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose-dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented. Aspirin and phenylbutazone are associated with intrinsic hepatotoxicity; idiosyncratic reaction has been associated with ibuprofen, sulindac, phenylbutazone, piroxicam, diclofenac and indomethacin.

=== Glucocorticoids ===
Glucocorticoids are so named due to their effect on the carbohydrate mechanism. They promote glycogen storage in the liver. An enlarged liver is a rare side-effect of long-term steroid use in children. The classical effect of prolonged use both in adult and paediatric population is steatosis.

=== Isoniazid ===
Isoniazide (INH) is one of the most commonly used drugs for tuberculosis; it is associated with mild elevation of liver enzymes in up to 20% of patients and severe hepatotoxicity in 1-2% of patients.

=== Other hydrazine derivative drugs ===
There are also cases where other hydrazine derivative drugs, such as the MAOI antidepressant iproniazid, are associated with liver damage. Phenelzine has been associated with abnormal liver tests. Toxic effects can develop from antibiotics.

=== Natural products ===

Examples include alpha-Amanitin containing mushrooms, kava, and aflatoxin producing molds. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which occur in some plants, can be toxic. Green tea extract is a growing cause of liver failure due to its inclusion in more products.

===Alternative remedies===
Examples include: Ackee fruit, Bajiaolian, Camphor, Copaltra, Cycasin, Garcinia, Kava leaves, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, Horse chestnut leaves, Valerian, Comfrey. Chinese herbal remedies: Jin Bu Huan, Ephedra, Shou Wu Pian, Bai Xian Pi.

=== Industrial toxin ===
Examples include arsenic, carbon tetrachloride, and vinyl chloride.

== Mechanism ==

Drugs continue to be taken off the market due to late discovery of hepatotoxicity. Due to its unique metabolism and close relationship with the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is susceptible to injury from drugs and other substances. 75% of blood coming to the liver arrives directly from gastrointestinal organs and the spleen via portal veins that bring drugs and xenobiotics in near-undiluted form. Several mechanisms are responsible for either inducing hepatic injury or worsening the damage process.

Many chemicals damage mitochondria, an intracellular organelle that produces energy. Its dysfunction releases excessive amount of oxidants that, in turn, injure hepatic cells. Activation of some enzymes in the cytochrome P-450 system such as CYP2E1 also lead to oxidative stress. Injury to hepatocyte and bile duct cells lead to accumulation of bile acid inside the liver. This promotes further liver damage. Non-parenchymal cells such as Kupffer cells, collagen-producing stellate cells, and leukocytes (i.e. neutrophil and monocyte) also have a role in the mechanism.

=== Drug metabolism in liver ===

The human body subjects most, but not all, compounds to various chemical processes (i.e. metabolism) to make them suitable for elimination. This involves chemical transformations to (a) reduce fat solubility and (b) to change biological activity. Although almost all tissues in the body have some ability to metabolize chemicals, smooth endoplasmic reticulum in the liver is the principal &quot;metabolic clearing house&quot; for both endogenous chemicals (e.g., cholesterol, steroid hormones, fatty acids, proteins) and exogenous substances (e.g., drugs, alcohol). The central role played by liver in the clearance and transformation of chemicals makes it susceptible to drug-induced injury.

Drug metabolism is usually divided into two phases: &quot;phase 1&quot; and &quot;phase 2&quot;. Phase 1 reaction is generally speaking to prepare a drug for phase 2. However, many compounds can be metabolized by phase 2 directly or be excreted without any phase 2 reactions occurring. Phase 1 reaction involves oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, hydration and many other rare chemical reactions. These processes tend to increase water solubility of the drug and can generate metabolites that are more chemically active and/or potentially toxic. Most of phase 2 reactions take place in cytosol and involve conjugation with endogenous compounds via transferase enzymes. Phase 1 are typically more suitable for elimination.

A group of enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum, known as cytochrome P-450, is the most important family of metabolizing enzymes in the liver. Cytochrome P-450 is not a single enzyme, but rather consists of a closely related family of 50 isoforms; six of them metabolize 90% of drugs. There is a tremendous diversity of individual P-450 gene products, and this heterogeneity allows the liver to perform oxidation on a vast array of chemicals (including most drugs) in phase 1. Three important characteristics of the P-450 system have roles in drug-induced toxicity:

:1. Genetic diversity:
Each of the P-450 proteins is unique and accounts (to some extent) for the variation in drug metabolism between individuals. Genetic variations (polymorphism) in P-450 metabolism should be considered when patients exhibit unusual sensitivity or resistance to drug effects at normal doses. Such polymorphism is also responsible for variable drug response among patients of differing ethnic backgrounds.

:2. Change in enzyme activity:
Many substances can influence the P-450 enzyme mechanism. Drugs interact with the enzyme family in several ways. Drugs that modify cytochrome P-450 enzyme are referred to as either inhibitors or inducers. Enzyme inhibitors block the metabolic activity of one or several P-450 enzymes. This effect usually occurs immediately. On the other hand, inducers increase P-450 activity by increasing enzyme production, or, in the case of CYP2E1, preventing degradation in the proteasome. There is usually a delay before enzyme activity increases.

:3. Competitive inhibition:
Some drugs may share the same P-450 specificity and thus competitively block their biotransformation. This may lead to accumulation of drugs metabolized by the enzyme. This type of drug interaction may also reduce the rate of generation of toxic metabolites.

===Patterns of injury===
Chemicals produce a wide variety of clinical and pathological hepatic injury. Biochemical markers (e.g. alanine transferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) are often used to indicate liver damage. Liver injury is defined as a rise in either (a) ALT level more than three times of upper limit of normal (ULN), (b) ALP level more than twice ULN, or (c) total bilirubin level more than twice ULN when associated with increased ALT or ALP. Liver damage is further characterized into hepatocellular (predominantly initial Alanine transferase elevation) and cholestatic (initial alkaline phosphatase rise) types. However they are not mutually exclusive and mixed types of injuries are often encountered.

Specific histo-pathological patterns of liver injury from drug-induced damage are discussed below.

====Zonal Necrosis====

This is the most common type of drug-induced liver cell necrosis where the injury is largely confined to a particular zone of the liver lobule. It may manifest as a very high level of ALT and severe disturbance of liver function leading to acute liver failure.
:Causes include:
:Paracetamol, carbon tetrachloride

====Hepatitis====

In this pattern, hepatocellular necrosis is associated with infiltration of inflammatory cells. There can be three types of drug-induced hepatitis. (A) viral hepatitis is the most common, where histological features are similar to acute viral hepatitis. (B) in focal or non-specific hepatitis, scattered foci of cell necrosis may accompany lymphocytic infiltration. (C) chronic hepatitis is very similar to autoimmune hepatitis clinically, serologically, and histologically.
:Causes:
:(a) Viral hepatitis: Halothane, isoniazid, phenytoin
:(b) Focal hepatitis: Aspirin
:(c) Chronic hepatitis: Methyldopa, diclofenac

====Cholestasis====
Liver injury leads to impairment of bile flow and cases are predominated by itching and jaundice. Histology may show inflammation (cholestatic hepatitis) or it can be bland (without any parenchymal inflammation). On rare occasions, it can produce features similar to primary biliary cirrhosis due to progressive destruction of small bile ducts (vanishing duct syndrome).
:Causes:
:(a) Bland: Oral contraceptive pills, anabolic steroid, androgens
:(b) Inflammatory: Allopurinol, co-amoxiclav, carbamazepine
:(c) Ductal: Chlorpromazine, flucloxacillin

====Steatosis====
Hepatotoxicity may manifest as triglyceride accumulation, which leads to either small-droplet (microvesicular) or large-droplet (macrovesicular) fatty liver. There is a separate type of steatosis by which phospholipid accumulation leads to a pattern similar to the diseases with inherited phospholipid metabolism defects (e.g., Tay–Sachs disease)
:Causes:
:(a) Microvesicular: Aspirin (Reye&#x27;s syndrome), ketoprofen, tetracycline (especially if expired)
:(b) Macrovesicular: Acetaminophen, methotrexate
:(c) Phospholipidosis: Amiodarone, total parenteral nutrition
:(d) Antiviral: nucleoside analogues
:(e) Corticosteroid
:(f) Hormonal: Tamoxifen

====Granuloma====
Drug-induced hepatic granulomas are usually associated with granulomas in other tissues and patients typically have features of systemic vasculitis and hypersensitivity. More than 50 drugs have been implicated.
: Causes:
:Allopurinol, phenytoin, isoniazid, quinine, penicillin, quinidine

====Vascular lesions====
These result from injury to the vascular endothelium.
:Causes:
:Venoocclusive disease: Chemotherapeutic agents, bush tea
:Peliosis hepatis: Anabolic steroids
:Hepatic vein thrombosis: Oral contraceptives

====Neoplasm====
Neoplasms have been described with prolonged exposure to some medications or toxins. Hepatocellular carcinoma, angiosarcoma, and liver adenomas are the ones usually reported.
:Causes:
:Vinyl chloride, combined oral contraceptive pill, anabolic steroid, arsenic, thorotrast

== Diagnosis ==

This remains a challenge in clinical practice due to a lack of reliable markers. Many other conditions lead to similar clinical as well as pathological pictures. To diagnose hepatotoxicity, a causal relationship between the use of the toxin or drug and subsequent liver damage has to be established, but might be difficult, especially when idiosyncratic reaction is suspected. Simultaneous use of multiple drugs may add to the complexity. As in acetaminophen toxicity, well established, dose-dependent, pharmacological hepatotoxicity is easier to spot. Several clinical scales such as CIOMS/RUCAM scale and Maria and Victorino criteria have been proposed to establish causal relationship between offending drug and liver damage. CIOMS/RUCAM scale involves a scoring system that categorizes the suspicion into &quot;definite or highly probable&quot; (score &gt; 8), &quot;probable&quot; (score 6–8), &quot;possible&quot; (score 3–5), &quot;unlikely&quot; (score 1–2) and &quot;excluded&quot; (score ≤ 0). In clinical practice, physicians put more emphasis on the presence or absence of similarity between the biochemical profile of the patient and known biochemical profile of the suspected toxicity (e.g., cholestatic damage in amoxycillin-clauvonic acid ).

== Treatment ==
In most cases, liver function will return to normal if the offending drug is stopped early. Additionally, the patient may require supportive treatment. In acetaminophen toxicity, however, the initial insult can be fatal. Fulminant hepatic failure from drug-induced hepatotoxicity may require liver transplantation. In the past, glucocorticoids in allergic features and ursodeoxycholic acid in cholestatic cases had been used, but there is no good evidence to support their effectiveness.

==Prognosis==

An elevation in serum bilirubin level of more than 2 times ULN with associated transaminase rise is an ominous sign. This indicates severe hepatotoxicity and is likely to lead to mortality in 10% to 15% of patients, especially if the offending drug is not stopped (Hy&#x27;s Law). This is because it requires significant damage to the liver to impair bilirubin excretion, hence minor impairment (in the absence of biliary obstruction or Gilbert syndrome) would not lead to jaundice. Other poor predictors of outcome are old age, female sex, high AST.

== Drugs withdrawn ==
The following therapeutic drugs were withdrawn from the market primarily because of hepatotoxicity: Troglitazone, bromfenac, trovafloxacin, ebrotidine, nimesulide, nefazodone, ximelagatran and pemoline.

<text>IEC 60027 (formerly IEC 27) is a technical international standard for letter symbols published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), comprising the following parts:
* IEC 60027-1: General
* IEC 60027-2: Telecommunications and electronics
* IEC 60027-3: Logarithmic and related quantities, and their units
* IEC 60027-4: Symbols for quantities to be used for rotating electrical machines
* IEC 60027-6: Control technology
* IEC 60027-7: Physiological quantities and units

A closely related international standard on quantities and units is ISO 31. The ISO 31 and IEC 60027 Standards are being revised by the two standardization organizations in collaboration. The revised harmonized standard is known as ISO/IEC 80000, Quantities and units. It supersedes both ISO 31 and part of IEC 60027.

== IEC 60027-2 ==
IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2, as published in January 1999, was the first international standard defining the binary prefixes, as proposed by International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) since 1996 (&quot;kibi-&quot; (Ki), &quot;mebi-&quot; (Mi), &quot;gibi-&quot; (Gi) and &quot;tebi-&quot; (Ti)) but extended them up to &quot;pebi&quot; (Pi) and &quot;exbi-&quot; (Ei). This didn&#x27;t change in the second edition of the standard, published in 2000, but the third edition in 2005 added prefixes &quot;zebi-&quot; (Zi) and &quot;yobi-&quot; (Yi). The harmonized ISO/IEC IEC 80000-13:2008 standard supersedes subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005. The only significant change is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities.

<text>The DHBW Mosbach (Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University Mosbach) is a public institution of higher education in Germany that is part of the &quot;Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg (DHBW)&quot;, a network of cooperative colleges in which students alternate periods of academic study with periods of paid professional employment related to their major. Its main campus is in Mosbach and it also maintains locations in Bad Mergentheim and Heilbronn. It was founded in 1980 as &quot;Berufsakademie Mosbach&quot; and became a member of the newly created DHBW in 2009. It has about 3000 students.

==Dual System==
A specific characteristic of the cooperative colleges is the tight integration of academic instruction and practical training. Students spend about half of their program at the college and the other half in a private company (such as a technology business or bank) or public institution. Theoretical training at the college and practical work at the company alternate in 3-month blocks. The companies select the students and offer them a salaried contract. At the end of the three-year program, students receive a Bachelor&#x27;s degree; some also pursue Master&#x27;s degrees.

==Courses==
DHBW Mosbach offers the following majors at undergraduate level:

<doc id="463517" wikidata="Q7039077" url="?curid=463517" title="Ninomiya, Tochigi">
<text>was a town located in Haga District, lying in the extreme south-east of Tochigi Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2006, the town had an estimated population of 16,765 and a density of 300.52 persons per km2. The total area is 55.45 km2, spanning 14 km east–west and 9 km north–south at its widest points. 

On March 23, 2009, Ninomiya was merged into the expanded city of Mo&#x27;oka. 

Ninomiya commonly means &quot;the second shrine&quot; of the province, but this town is named after an 18th-century hero, Ninomiya Sontoku. There is a museum dedicated to the town&#x27;s namesake in the area of Ninomiya known as Monobe.

The town of Ninomiya was formed in 1955 when the town of Kugeta (久下田) and the two villages of Monobe (物部) and Naganuma (長沼) merged to form a single administrative area. The train station (serving the Mooka Line) still bears the name of Kugeta. A popular tourist attraction is the local steam train which stops at Kugeta on its route to and from Shimodate (下館) and Motegi (茂木). 

Ninomiya was the largest producer of strawberries in Japan, and many of the town&#x27;s inhabitants are involved in the cultivation of this fruit.

<doc id="463519" wikidata="Q2118505" url="?curid=463519" title="Impromptu (1991 film)">
<text>Impromptu is a 1991 period drama film directed by James Lapine, written by Sarah Kernochan, produced by Daniel A. Sherkow and Stuart Oken, and starring Hugh Grant as Frédéric Chopin and Judy Davis as George Sand. It was shot entirely on location in France as a British production by an American company. Its main filming location was at the Château des Briottières outside Angers, in the Loire Valley.

==Plot==
Since getting divorced, Baroness Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin (previously Baroness Dudevant, the successful and notorious writer of sensational romance novels), has been living in Paris, under the pseudonym George Sand and dressing like a man. In her romantic pursuit of the sensitive Frédéric Chopin, whose music she fell in love with before meeting him, George/Aurore is advised that she must act like a man pursuing a woman, though also advised to avoid damaging Chopin&#x27;s health by pursuing him. With this advice she is deterred by a fellow countrywoman (the mistress of Franz Liszt), Countess Marie d&#x27;Agoult, pretending to be smitten with Chopin in order to prevent a relationship between Chopin and Sand.

Sand meets Chopin in 1836 in the French country house of the Duchess d&#x27;Antan, a foolish aspiring socialite who invites artists from Paris to her salon to make her feel cosmopolitan. Sand invites herself, hoping to meet Chopin, not knowing that a few of her former lovers are also in attendance. A small play written by Alfred de Musset is presented, satirising the aristocracy and specifically mocking their hostess. When Chopin protests at this lack of manners, de Musset bellows and a fireplace explosion ensues.

Chopin is briefly swayed by a beautifully written love letter, ostensibly from d&#x27;Agoult but actually written by Sand and stolen from her. Eventually Sand wins over Chopin when she proves that she wrote the letter, reciting it to him passionately; after buying a copy of her memoir, he finds the text of the letter in the book.

Chopin is then challenged to a duel by one of Sand&#x27;s ex-lovers. He faints during the face-off. Sand finishes the duel for him and nurses him back to health in the countryside, thereby consolidating their relationship.

Towards the end of the film, Sand and Chopin dedicate a volume of music to the Countess, although this only implies that she has had an affair with Chopin, causing a falling-out with her lover Liszt. Sand and Chopin depart for Majorca, relieved to escape the competitive nature of artistic alliances and jealousies in Paris.

==Cast==
* Judy Davis as George Sand (Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dupin)
* Hugh Grant as Frédéric Chopin
* Mandy Patinkin as Alfred de Musset
* Bernadette Peters as Marie Catherine Sophie, Comtesse d&#x27;Agoult
* Julian Sands as Franz Liszt
* Ralph Brown as Eugène Delacroix
* Georges Corraface as Felicien Mallefille
* Anton Rodgers as Duke d&#x27;Antan
* Emma Thompson as Duchess d&#x27;Antan
* Anna Massey as Sophie-Victorie Delaborde, George Sand&#x27;s Mother

The film&#x27;s supporting actors include David Birkin as Maurice, John Savident as Buloz, Lucy Speed as Young Aurore, and Elizabeth Spriggs as Baroness Laginsky.

==Production==
Sarah Kernochan, director James Lapine&#x27;s wife, had written the film in 1988 during a lay-off due to 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Kernochan explained the film: &quot;How do complicated people find a simple way of loving?&quot; The producer Stuart Oken liked the project; his concern was to give Lapine &quot;a chance to realise his vision and become a movie director.&quot; Oken brought the project to his friend and fellow producer, Dan Sherkow, who secured financing and distribution for the picture.

For the cast, Lapine wanted &quot;to use people he had worked with before.&quot; He cast actors who &quot;didn&#x27;t look like the characters, yet embodied them.&quot; Judy Davis and Mandy Patinkin could &quot;hardly look more unlike the cultural icons they portray.&quot; Lapine hired a piano coach and a music consultant to advise Grant and Sands on piano techniques.

Due to European Community legalities, the film was incorporated as a British production with co-production by the French company Ariane Films and distribution by the United States company Sovereign Pictures. The budget was $6 million.

==Release, reception==
&quot;Impromptu&quot; was released on 12 April 1991 in the United Kingdom. It was later broadcast on PBS&#x27;s Masterpiece Theatre in 1993.

===Critical reception===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 74% based on 19 reviews, with an average score of 6.1/10. Jeff Millar of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; wrote that the film is &quot;a zingy, impudent little essay on gender, with the exquisitely confusing George Sand at its center.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film 3/4 stars, writing, &quot;The film has little serious interest in George Sand, and almost none in the novels that are all that remain of her, but diverts itself with scandal, atmosphere, location, and witty repartee.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, likening it to the films of Ken Russell. Speaking of director James Lapine&#x27;s approach, Maslin said, &quot;Handling this material playfully, he tosses together the film&#x27;s artistic luminaries and allows them to indulge in outrageous antics, like the scene that finds Sand pleading for Chopin&#x27;s affections and telling him she needs only a minute of his time to explain her feelings.&quot; Terrence Rafferty wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that the film was &quot;an ebullient and absurdly entertaining account of the famous love affair of George Sand and Frédéric Chopin. ...The historical figures in this movie are cartoons, but they’re cartoons with recognizable human qualities, and the actors look as if they were having a wonderful time charging around in their period costumes. Hugh Grant’s Chopin is a brilliant caricature of the Romantic ideal of the artist; he gives the character an air of befuddled unworldliness, and punctuates his readings with delicately timed tubercular coughs. Judy Davis plays Sand—a great actress in a great role.&quot;

<text>Benjamin Samuel Bloom (February 21, 1913 – September 13, 1999) was an American educational psychologist who made contributions to the classification of educational objectives and to the theory of mastery learning. He is particularly noted for leading educational psychologists to develop the comprehensive system of describing and assessing educational outcomes in the mid-1950s. He has influenced the practices and philosophies of educators around the world from the latter part of the twentieth century.

== Early life and education ==
Bloom was born in Lansford, Pennsylvania, to an immigrant Jewish family. His parents fled a climate of discrimination in Russia. He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1935 and a master&#x27;s degree from Penn State, also in 1935. He received a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1942 and joined its faculty in 1944.

From 1965-1966, he served as president of the American Educational Research Association.

== Works ==
In 1956, Bloom edited the first volume of &quot;The Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals&quot;, which classified learning objectives according to a rubric that has come to be known as Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy. It was one of the first attempts to systematically classify levels of cognitive functioning and gave structure to the otherwise amorphous mental processes of gifted students. Bloom&#x27;s Taxonomy remains a foundation of the academic profession according to the 1981 survey, &quot;Significant Writings That Have Influenced the Curriculum: 1906–81&quot; by Harold G. Shane and the National Society for the Study of Education. Bloom&#x27;s 2 Sigma Problem is also attributed to him.

Benjamin Bloom conducted research on student achievement. Through conducting a variety of studies, Bloom and his colleagues observed factors within the school environment as well as outside of it that can affect how children can learn. One example was the lack of variation in teaching. Bloom hypothesized if teachers adapted their teaching methods to the individual needs of each student, more children would receive the opportunity to learn better. This led to the creation of Bloom&#x27;s Mastery Learning procedure. This procedure required that teachers organize skills and concepts into instructional units approximately 1–2 weeks in length. At the end of the unit, the student would receive an assessment that would provide the student with constructive feedback on what the child learned from the unit. If a child lacked understanding on any of the major concepts of the unit, they would be assigned corrective assignments based on information they had trouble understanding. They would then take a second assessment focusing specifically on the skills and concepts they were instructed to practice on. This insures each student gains individualized instruction at a pace the child needs in order to learn at an optimum level. For students who showed mastery of the given unit, it is recommended they receive enrichment activities to further learning experiences. These activities are self-selected by the student and may come in the form of academic games, reports, special projects, etc.

Aside from his work on educational objectives and outcomes, Bloom also directed a research team that evaluated and elucidated the process of developing exceptional talents in individuals, shedding light upon the phenomena of vocational eminence and the concept of greatness.

In the article &quot;The Role of Gifts and Markers in the Development of Talent&quot; (1982), 70 individuals that are known as being among the best in their field are interviewed, in addition to their parents, teachers, and other significant persons in their life. The purpose of the interviews was to collect the various special characteristics believed to have been the reasons for their success. The individuals studied were mathematicians, Olympic swimmers, and concert pianists who were arguably some of the most successful in their field. The three main characteristics frequently shared in the interviews by the individuals, their parents, and teachers was willingness to work, competitiveness, and ability to learn new techniques. By the end of the Bloom&#x27;s interviews, it was noted after all the data was collected that the interpretation of the parent&#x27;s children as being talented led to the parents creating an environment that allowed for growth within the subject through hiring teachers/tutors, opportunities in the form of competitions and events, and overall encouragement from the parents and others involved in the individuals life. The belief that the individuals were talented, the attention given to a specific characteristic observed, as well as the possible inherent gift of the individual were considered to be markers. The markers were defined as the major reasons for the encouragement and motivation exhibited by the teachers and parents of the successful individuals. These factors in addition to the individual&#x27;s interest and willingness to work in their respective field are arguably some of the reasons for their huge success.

<text>An impromptu (, , loosely meaning &quot;offhand&quot;) is a free-form musical composition with the character of an &quot;ex tempore&quot; improvisation as if prompted by the spirit of the moment, usually for a solo instrument, such as piano. According to &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;, Johann Baptist Cramer began publishing piano pieces under the (sub-)title of &quot;impromptu.&quot; (AMZ, Mar. No II, 1815, col. 6), which seems to be the first recorded use of the term &quot;impromptu&quot; in this sense.

==Form usage==

Since the very concept of unpremeditated, spur-of-the-moment inspiration without studied care is at the heart of Romantic artistic theory, it did not take long before the first generation of Romantic composers took up the idea. Others were:
* Frédéric Chopin composed 4 &quot;Impromptus&quot;, including the famous Fantaisie-Impromptu.
* Jan Václav Voříšek was the first one to compose impromptus published under that title, in 1822.
* Franz Schubert published two sets of four &quot;Impromptus&quot; for piano, Op. 90 and Op. 142 (1827). After his death three more unnamed piano compositions (&quot;Klavierstücke&quot;) were sometimes named &quot;Impromptus&quot;.
* Robert Schumann wrote some Impromptus, published as Op. 5 (1833).
* Charles-Valentin Alkan composed two sets of four Impromptus, published as Op. 32 (No. 1 in 1848, and No. 2 in 1849).
* Franz Liszt composed an Impromptu in F sharp (sometimes called Nocturne) and a piano piece named Valse-Impromptu.
* Alexander Scriabin is known to have written at least nine impromptus for the piano in his early period.
* Jean Sibelius composed six impromptus for piano op. 5 (1893)
The impromptu genre remained popular all throughout the 19th century and was prominent throughout the romantic era.

In the 20th century, there are also several examples of composers naming their compositions &quot;Impromptu&quot;, such as:
* Gabriel Fauré composing six &quot;Impromptus&quot; between 1881 and 1913.
* Richard Rodney Bennett composing five &quot;Impromptus&quot; for guitar in 1968
* Maurice Journeau composing six &quot;Impromptus&quot; between 1971 and 1974.
* Donald Martino composing &quot;Fantasies and Impromptu&quot; in 1980.
* Nikolai Kapustin composing four &quot;Impromptus&quot; between 1991 and 1997.
* Lowell Liebermann composing &quot;Three Impromptus Op.68&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Two Impromptus Op.131&quot; in 2016.
* Vince Mendoza&#x27;s Epiphany, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and published in 1999. The first piece of the album is named &quot;Impromptu&quot;.
* One of Queen&#x27;s songs, performed at Wembley Stadium and other performances is named &quot;Impromptu&quot;.

<text>Ambrussum (, ; ) is a Roman archaeological site in Villetelle, Occitania, Southern France.

It is close to the modern town Lunel, between Nîmes and Montpellier. Ambrussum is notable for its museum, its staging post on the Via Domitia, its bridge &quot;Pont Ambroix&quot; over the Vidourle, painted by Gustave Courbet, and for its &quot;oppidum&quot; (fortified village). Its history of settlement spanned 400 years.

The whole site is still being excavated. A lower settlement prone to flooding was a staging post for travellers on the Via Domitia and provided stabling and accommodation and the full range of repair facilities that were needed by carts and the Imperial postal service. The higher settlement was based on a pre-Roman oppidum which was within a surrounding wall including 21 towers. The Romans re-modelled the oppidum, so there is evidence of a complete range of housing styles from the earliest one room dwellings to sophisticated courtyard houses on the second century AD.

The Roman road, the Via Domitia, ran at the foot of the settlement, leading from it is a paved road with visible with traces of Roman chariot tracks. The Roman bridge was used until the Middle Ages but fell into disrepair, and only one complete arch remains.

==Location==
Ambrussum, or its alternative spelling of &quot;Ambrusium&quot;, is mentioned as a staging post (mutatio) on the Antonine Itinerary of AD 200, on pilgrims&#x27; guide on the route to the Holy Land of AD 333 and on the Peutinger map of 1520. All place it midway between Nimes (Nemausis) and Castelnau-le-Lez (Sextantio), about from each.

The Via Domitia linked the Alps with the Pyrenees, and is the oldest Roman Road in Gaul, more specifically Gallia Narbonensis in France. Laid out by Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus around 120 BC, it was to become part of the roads that linked Italy with Cadiz in Spain. At Ambussum the Via Domitia crosses the Vidourle, and the settlement provided a staging post on this road. Directly adjacent to the site, the modern A9 autoroute, the &quot;Languedocienne&quot; crosses the Vidourle and at this point there is the modern day equivalent of a mutatio, the Aire de service de Lunel. The site is reached through the village of Villetelle.

The bridge is 20 m above sea level, and the highest point of the oppidum is 58 m. When in spate the Vidourle will rise by 8 m. From the highest point, the Oppidum de Nages is easily seen. Further one can see Mont Ventoux, Pic Saint-Loup, and the hills of the Cevennes including the Causse du Larzac and Mont Aigoual.

==History==
The site was first settled in 2,300 BC and the construction started on the oppidum around 300 BC. It was a settlement of Gauls. The Romans conquered the area in 120 BC. The paved road at the heart of the oppidum was laid around 100 BC. Between the oppidum and the river was a staging post (mutatio) on the Via Domitia. That, and the Pont Ambroix were constructed in around 30 BC. The flow patterns of the river changed around 10 BC; it became more aggressive and flooding became more frequent. The large houses on the south of the oppidum were built in AD 50. The whole oppidum was abandoned in AD 100, but parts of the lower settlement were still in use in AD 400, and the Pont Ambroix continued in use throughout the Middle Ages. It took a battering from the Vidourlades, or violent floods or spates on the Vidourle. During a spate, the water flow increases from a minimum of 3 m3/s to over 3000 m3/s. Floods were recorded on 8 October 1723. The floods of 18 November 1745 reduced the bridge from four arches to three. Further major floods occurred on 6 October 1812, 21 October 1891, and 21 September 1907. The floods of 7 September 1933 reduced the bridge from two arches to the one we see today. The site was abandoned when transit patterns changed, the Domitia became less important and the community relocated to Lunel-Viel, which better served a north–south transit. The site was returned to its natural state, and later to the cultivation of vines and olives. This protected the archaeological record.

==Site==
Ambrussum contains three archaeological sites of international importance: the Colline de Devès which was first occupied in 2300 BC and settled as an oppidum between 300 BC and 100 AD; the Roman staging post on the Via Domitia which had hotels, a baths and industrial buildings; the Roman bridge, the Pont Ambroix.

The bridge is a Mérimée list National Monument No. PA00103057. The oppidum is a Mérimée list National Monument No. PA00103760 

===Oppidum===
Originally the Oppidum was the work of the Volcae Arecomici who started it in the fourth century BC. Nine square houses from the earliest period were recorded by Émile Marignan, these were roofed with branches and reeds. A rectangular house from the third century has been excavated. This contained both rough earthenware pottery for cooking and a finer black glazed table ware. During the first century BC, the hill was terraced and the houses became narrower similar to those found at Nages.

The hill was fortified in the late fourth century BC, the ramparts enclosed an area of . It was triangular in form but most of the eastern section was looted to be used in lime kilns. It consisted of a dry limestone wall. There were three gateways, one to the north, south and east. The western section of the wall, cleared in 1974, revealed 24 bastions. These were originally rectangular but were replaced in the mid-third century BC with rounded ones. Two of the towers were substantially higher; these were built as watch towers and for prestige. The ramparts were abandoned in the first century AD.

After the Romans settled the area in 120 BC the hill was redeveloped, the residential areas were reorganised, and the road through the settlement from the east gate to the south gate was paved. The south gate was enlarged and a large square was cleared behind with a civil basilica, stones of which made their way in the second century AD to the staging post. The Via Domitia would have passed around the hill, but it has been speculated that it passed along this narrow road. The route of the Via often passes along roads with the name &#x27;Route de la Monnaie&#x27;, but as this originates from a translation of &#x27;raised road&#x27; it merely shows that the road was using Roman construction techniques rather than that it formed part of the Via Domitia. The south gate does lead to a &#x27;Route de la Monnaie&#x27;, but the paved road in the oppidum has a gradient of 9% and is too narrow for carts to pass, although it would have been suitable for important visitors. The paved road at the east gate leads towards the bridge, but stops abruptly at a steep bank. It is thought that the river has undercut the bank at this point and removed all traces of the road.

The north of the post-conquest oppidum is densely populated, but the houses there were of the domus style found throughout the Empire - courtyard dwellings where the slaves lived closest to the entrance and the family in the building opposite. To the south are some large courtyard homes built around AD 50.

The whole oppidum was abandoned in AD 100.

===Staging post===

The existence of a staging post for the Imperial mail is known of from written sources, and also that it was located by the Vidourle and as a consequence was continually being rebuilt. An embankment was built to protect the settlement from flooding. The Imperial staging post itself was a complex containing two courtyards and two buildings. In the south gallery, the walls were decorated with paintings and a purse containing 43 denarii has also been found there. This building would have been for Imperial messengers and travelling officials. It was renovated and possibly changed its use in the fourth century AD, at a time when the rest of the site had been abandoned. 
A separate inn has been excavated. It contained a courtyard for the animals and carts and five guest rooms. Adjacent was a building with a bread oven. The inn remained substantially unchanged from 30 BC to AD 125. Nearby, and closer to the water were two further inns, parts of which date from AD 200 to 250. The settlement was substantial enough to have a bathhouse. Although most of it is now beneath a modern road, the heater chamber remains. The praefurnia took the heated air to the underfloor heating, hot water to the calidarium and steam to the laconicum. There was also a blacksmith&#x27;s courtyard house with a forge specialising in carriage building. This dates from AD 25 to 175. Excavations are still continuing; the land is privately owned and not accessible to the public.

===Pont Ambroix===
The bridge was built across the Vidourle River with 11 arches. It was still usable in the Middle Ages, with all 11 arches intact, but a sketch by Anne Rulman in 1620 shows only four and then when painted by Gustave Courbet in 1857 only two arches were left. One of those was lost in the flooding of 1933, so only a single arch remains.

==Excavation==

The antiquity of the Pont Ambroix had never been disputed and it had been visited by Mérimée, who included it in the first edition of his Historical Monuments of France in 1840. The adjacent hill, the &quot;Colline de Devès&quot;, was not investigated until the 1960s however. In 1964 Marc Fenouillet did a surface inspection in the vineyard at the base of the hill and found Roman era remains. In November 1967, the first archaeological test digging was begun on the hill itself by Jean-Luc Fiches and traces of the oppidum were found; a larger, volunteer dig was made the following July. In 1974, a path had been cleared around the ramparts and the oppidum was recognised and classified as an historic monument. A regular pattern of annual digs was established. The paved road was discovered in 1975. Between 1980 and 1985 further excavations established that the lower site, adjacent to the bridge, was a staging post on the Via Domitia. In 1984 the hill was donated to authorities in Lunel but the lower site remains in private ownership. There was a pause in the excavations between 1986 and 1992. Subsequently, the lower site became the focus of attention, along with the contours of the river. In 2009 the community of Lunel began the construction of a visitor centre and museum, although work was interrupted in May 2011 by an accidental fire that set the vegetation alight. Four water-carrying aircraft Canadairs were called in to help the firefighters sapeur-pompiers extinguish the fire. Fortuitously, the fire revealed more features of the oppidum. The museum designed by Michel Goroneskoul opened on 25 June 2011.

<doc id="463528" wikidata="Q1588993" url="?curid=463528" title="Hats (party)">
<text>The Hats () were a Swedish political faction active during the Age of Liberty (1719–1772). Their name derives from the tricorne hat worn by officers and gentlemen. They vied for power with the opposing Caps party. In 18th century Swedish politics, the Hats represented conservatives, the Caps represented liberals. The Hats, who ruled Sweden from 1738 to 1765, advocated an alliance with France and an assertive foreign policy, especially towards Russia. During their tenure, they involved Sweden in two expensive and disastrous wars, in the 1740s and 1750s.

==Policy==

Count Arvid Horn, leader of the Caps, had governed Sweden since 1719. Following Sweden&#x27;s defeat in the Great Northern War, he had reversed the traditional policy of Sweden by keeping France at a distance, drawing near to Great Britain, and making no significant effort to regain Sweden&#x27;s lost Baltic empire. Those opposed to this peaceful policy derisively nicknamed his adherents &quot;Night-caps&quot;, and these epithets became party badges when the estates met in 1738. The Hats routed the government, and Horn was compelled to retire after 33 years in high office. Now in power, the Hats aimed at restoring Sweden to her former position as a great power, and sought to renew the traditional alliance with France. France welcomed the rise of a Swedish government which would uphold French interests in northern Europe, and Versailles generously financed the Hat party for the next two generations.

The first sign of weakness in the Hats&#x27; government came after the war with Russia, which ended in Swedish defeat. In the Riksdag, an inquiry into the conduct of the war was proposed. The Hats managed to avoid this prospect by obtaining precedence for the succession question. King Frederick I had no legitimate children, and it fell to the Riksdag to elect his successor. Negotiations were opened with the Russian empress, Elizabeth of Russia, who agreed to restore the greater part of Finland to Sweden if her heir&#x27;s uncle, Adolph Frederick of Holstein, were elected successor to the Swedish crown. The Hats eagerly caught at the opportunity of recovering the grand duchy and their own prestige along with it. By the Treaty of Åbo, on 7 May 1743, the terms of the empress were accepted and only a small part which lay beyond the Kymi river, often called Old Finland, was retained by Russia.

In the 1750s, the Hats saw the utter collapse of their foreign system. At the instigation of France they entered the Seven Years&#x27; War in the Pomeranian theatre, and the result was ruinous. The French had not provided nearly enough money for a long war, and, after several years of unsuccessful fighting, the unhappy Hats made peace, withdrawing from a war which had cost the country 40,000 men. When the Riksdag met in 1760, the indignation against the Hat leaders was so violent that an impeachment seemed inevitable; but once more the superiority of their parliamentary tactics prevailed, and when, after a session of twenty months, the Riksdag was brought to a close by the mutual consent of both the exhausted factions, the Hat government was bolstered up for another four years. But the day of reckoning could not be postponed forever; and when the estates met in 1765 the Hats were comprehensively removed from power. The leader of the Caps, Ture Rudbeck, was elected marshal of the Diet over Frederick Axel von Fersen, the Hat candidate, by a large majority; and, out of the hundred seats in the secret committee, the Hats succeeded in getting only ten.

The Hats returned briefly to power in the Riksdag of 1769, but were soon once again defeated by the Caps. Against a backdrop of Russian encroachment, King Gustav III carried out a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; in 1772 and moved towards an absolute monarchy. During the political upheavals of the ensuing decades, both Hats and Caps disappeared as political forces.

==Majority leaders==
These representatives of the Hats were elected as Lantmarskalk (speaker) of the Riksdag of the Estates, signifying a parliamentary majority.

==Early life and education==
William Francis Nighy was born on 12 December 1949 in Caterham, Surrey, the son of Alfred Martin Nighy (1913–1976) and Catherine Josephine, (née Whittaker) (1915–2003). His father managed a car garage after working in the family chimney sweeping business; his mother was a psychiatric nurse of Irish descent born in Glasgow, Scotland.

Nighy was brought up as a Roman Catholic and served as an altar boy; however, he gave up &quot;being a practising Catholic&quot; as a teenager. He has two elder siblings, Martin and Anna. He attended the John Fisher School, a Roman Catholic grammar school in Purley, where he was nicknamed &quot;Knucks&quot; because of his hands. It was at John Fisher that he gained his first experience as an actor, with his &quot;reasonable&quot; memory earning him longer lines in the plays.

As a child Nighy was known by many to be insecure and shy; as a teenager he became an avid reader, particularly enjoying the works of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He left school at the age of 15, without qualifications, and later with a friend travelled to Paris hoping and failing &quot;to write a novel&quot;.

Nighy worked variously in a local employment office and as a messenger for &quot;The Croydon Advertiser&quot; and &quot;The Field&quot;. He then applied for a place at RADA, but was rejected and instead enrolled at the Guildford School of Dance and Drama to train for the stage.

== Career ==

=== 1969–1984: Early roles ===
After working in various regional theatre productions during his early twenties in theatres such as the Cambridge Arts Theatre and Edinburgh&#x27;s Traverse Theatre, a friend of Nighy&#x27;s suggested that he audition for the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool. During his audition he asked to start again about five times, according to fellow actor Jonathan Pryce, who said that &quot;either he was a very good actor, or a madman&quot;. During his time at the Everyman he worked alongside fellow actors Julie Walters and Pete Postlethwaite, and writers Ken Campbell and Willy Russell. He was also a member of the travelling theatre group Van Load, which included one of Nighy&#x27;s most frequent collaborators, writer and director David Hare.

Nighy made his London stage debut at the National Theatre in an epic staging of Ken Campbell and Chris Langham&#x27;s &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;, after he met Campbell at a bar in London. When Nighy told him that he was an actor, Campbell hired him on the spot. It opened the new Cottesloe Theatre on 4 March 1977. He was cast in two David Hare premieres, &quot;A Map of The World&quot; and &quot;Pravda&quot;, also at the National. Nighy starred in three episodes of the British anthology series &quot;Play For Today&quot; from 1978 to 1982. He played Samwise Gamgee in the 1981 BBC Radio dramatisation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (credited as William Nighy), and was heard in the 1980s BBC Radio version of &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

=== 1985–1999: National Theatre and acclaim ===
After Nighy made his debut, he steadily gained acclaim with his performances in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Pravda&quot; in 1985, William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; in 1986 and Anton Chekov&#x27;s &quot;The Seagull&quot; in 1994. At the National Theatre, he acted in productions alongside Anthony Hopkins, Judi Dench, Harriet Walter, Rufus Sewell and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Nighy&#x27;s most acclaimed stage performances were in National Theatre productions. As Bernard Nightingale, an unscrupulous university don, in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1993), he engaged in witty exchanges with Felicity Kendal, who played Hannah Jarvis, an author.

Nighy played Jerry in Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Betrayal&quot; in 1991 at the Almeida Theatre. He played a consultant psychiatrist in Joe Penhall&#x27;s &quot;Blue/Orange&quot; (2000), for which he received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Actor. It transferred to the West End at the Duchess Theatre the following year. In 1997, he starred as restaurant entrepreneur Tom Sergeant in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Skylight&quot;, which had premiered in 1995 and was moved to the Vaudeville Theatre. He played a libidinous young disc jockey, Vincent Fish, in the 1980 comedy series &quot;Agony&quot;, where he was the occasional lover of the lead character, played by Maureen Lipman. He also starred in two episodes of the BBC series &quot;Performance&quot; in 1991 and 1993.

One of Nighy&#x27;s early major screen appearances was the BBC serial &quot;The Men&#x27;s Room&quot; (1991). He claimed that the serial, an Ann Oakley novel adapted by Laura Lamson, was the job that launched his career. He received some recognition by American audiences for his acclaimed character portrayal of fifty-year-old rock star Ray Simms in the 1998 film &quot;Still Crazy&quot;. In 1999 he gained further prominence in the UK with the starring role in &quot;The Photographer&quot;, an episode of the award-winning BBC-TV mockumentary comedy series &quot;People Like Us&quot;, playing Will Rushmore, a middle aged man who has abandoned his career and family in the deluded belief that he can achieve success as a commercial photographer. Since 1999, Nighy has played Simon Brett&#x27;s fictional amateur sleuth Charles Paris at least 17 times on BBC Radio 4.

=== 2000–2009: Career expansion ===

In 2003, Nighy played the role of the Vampire Elder Viktor in the American production &quot;Underworld&quot;. (He returned to that role in the sequel &quot;&quot; in 2006, and again in the prequel &quot;&quot; in 2009.) In the same year he portrayed Billy Mack, an irreverent rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll legend, in the British ensemble romantic comedy film &quot;Love Actually&quot;, for which he was awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor. At the BAFTA Television Awards in April 2004, he won the Best Actor award for &quot;State of Play&quot;. He also appeared in the comedy &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot;. In early 2004, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that Nighy was on the shortlist for the role of the Ninth Doctor in the 2005 revival of the BBC television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Christopher Eccleston ultimately filled the role. In 2005, he appeared as Slartibartfast in the film adaptation of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

In 2005, he acted in the Fernando Meirelles-directed drama &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; alongside Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz. He also starred in the one-off BBC One comedy-drama &quot;The Girl in the Café&quot; alongside Kelly MacDonald for which he received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. In February 2006, he appeared in scriptwriter Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s one-off drama &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Nighy played the lead character, Gideon, a successful events organiser who begins to lose touch with the world around him. This performance won him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Mini-series or TV Film in January 2007. Also in 2006, Nighy made his Broadway debut alongside Julianne Moore in the David Hare play &quot;The Vertical Hour&quot;, directed by Sam Mendes at the Music Box Theatre. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; gave the production a mixed review, writing that &quot;Stuffed with stimulating insights, it&#x27;s never dull but ultimately feels as messy and unresolved as the conflict behind its central debate. Sam Mendes&#x27; production does have one reason for unstinting recommendation, however, in Bill Nighy&#x27;s fascinatingly eccentric performance.&quot;

In 2006, Nighy played the principal villain, Davy Jones, in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#x27;s Chest&quot; with his face entirely obscured by computer-generated makeup. He voiced the character with a Scots accent. He reprised the role in the 2007 sequel, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#x27;s End&quot;, in which his real face was briefly revealed in one scene. He also provided the narration for the Animal Planet series &quot;Meerkat Manor&quot;. In 2006 he played the role of Richard Hart in the Richard Eyre-directed drama &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot;, alongside Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. For the role he was nominated for a London Film Critics&#x27; Circle award. Nighy also appeared as General Friedrich Olbricht, one of the principal conspirators, in the 2008 film &quot;Valkyrie&quot;. He had played an SS officer in the 1985 &quot;Hitler&#x27;s SS: Portrait in Evil&quot;. He starred in the film &quot;Wild Target&quot; in 2010. In July 2009, he announced that he would play Rufus Scrimgeour in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;. Nighy had already worked with director David Yates twice, and with the majority of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; cast in previous films. He has said of his role as Rufus Scrimgeour that it meant he was no longer the only English actor not to be in &quot;Harry Potter&quot;.

=== 2010–2019: Established actor ===

In 2010, he made a small cameo in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in the episode titled &quot;Vincent and the Doctor&quot;. Nighy voiced Grandsanta in the 2011 animated film &quot;Arthur Christmas&quot;. In 2012, he starred in the British romantic comedy &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; acting opposite Judi Dench, Dev Patel, Tom Wilkinson, and Maggie Smith. Nighy along with the ensemble received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. That same year he acted in the action films &quot;Wrath of the Titans&quot; starring Sam Worthington and Ralph Fiennes and the remake of &quot;Total Recall&quot; starring Colin Farrell. In 2013, he played a role in &quot;Darkside&quot;, Tom Stoppard&#x27;s radio drama based on Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. In 2014 he acted in the historical comedy-drama film &quot;Pride&quot; and the science-fiction fantasy film &quot;I, Frankenstein&quot;.

During this time Nighy played MI5 agent Johnny Worricker in a trilogy of films written and directed by David Hare; &quot;Page Eight&quot; (2011), &quot;Turks &amp; Caicos&quot; (2014), and &quot;Salting the Battlefield&quot; (2014). Nighy acted in these films alongside Rachel Weisz, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, and Michael Gambon. For his performance in &quot;Page Eight&quot; he received nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. In 2014, he starred with Carey Mulligan in a revival of David Hare&#x27;s &quot;Skylight&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. It had a large international audience via broadcast in the National Theatre Live series. Nighy returned to Broadway starring in the transfer in &quot;Skylight&quot; alongside Mulligan where they both received nominations for the Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Play and Best Actress in a Play respectively. That same year he starred in the sequel to &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot;, titled &quot;The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; (2015).

The following year he acted in the war film &quot;Their Finest&quot; (2016) where it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival to positive reviews. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Nighy, describing him as &quot;a colossally proportioned scene-stealer&quot;. In that year he was in several films, including the British war comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, the animated feature &quot;Norm of the North&quot; and the horror-mystery &quot;The Limehouse Golem&quot;. In 2017, acting alongside Emily Mortimer, he starred in the drama &quot;The Bookshop&quot;, based on the 1978 novel of the same title by Penelope Fitzgerald. That same year he was in the short film &quot;Red Nose Day Actually&quot;, reprising his role of Billy Mack from &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003). Most of the actors from the original film appeared, including Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and Keira Knightley. The film aired on BBC One as part of the Red Nose Day 2017 fundraising event. In 2018 he starred in the three-episode BBC One series &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot;, an adaptation of the 1958 detective novel of the same name by Agatha Christie.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Living&quot; and critical acclaim ===
In 2020, he appeared as Mr Woodhouse, Emma&#x27;s father, in Autumn de Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Emma&quot; (2020) starring alongside Anya Taylor-Joy. The film received near-universal acclaim. &quot;Variety&quot; film critic Andrew Barker praised the casting of Nighy as Emma&#x27;s father, writing that the decision was an &quot;uncontested layup of casting&quot;. In October 2020, it was announced that Nighy would play the leading role in &quot;Living&quot;, an English-language adaptation of Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 Japanese drama &quot;Ikiru&quot;, to be directed by Oliver Hermanus from a screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro. Shooting began in spring 2021 in locations across the UK, including London and Worthing. The film premiered at Sundance in January 2022, where Nighy&#x27;s performance in particular received high praise. For his performance he went on to receive nominations for the Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor.

In the 2022 TV series &quot;The Man Who Fell to Earth&quot; Nighy played Thomas Newton, the first alien resident of Earth, who arrived over 40 years ago. This role originally was played by David Bowie in the 1976 film adaptation. Nighy is also the narrator of the Channel 5 travel show &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Scenic Railway Journeys&quot;, a programme that began its fifth series in autumn 2021 with episodes featuring train journeys across Australia and the Welsh borders. In 2022, Nighy became a DJ on BBC 6 Music when he stood in for Guy Garvey on the regular Sunday afternoon programme &quot;Guy Garvey&#x27;s Finest Hour&quot;, with Nighy deputising for the Elbow frontman again at the beginning of 2023. He later deputised for Iggy Pop on his show &quot;Iggy Confidential&quot; from March to April 2023, and again in December 2023.

==Personal life==
Beginning in 1982, Nighy was in a relationship with English actress Diana Quick, after they both played in David Hare&#x27;s &quot;A Map of The World&quot;. They have a daughter, actress and filmmaker Mary Nighy, born in 1984, and two grandchildren. The pair separated in 2008.

Nighy has Dupuytren&#x27;s contracture. The condition can, depending on its severity, cause contractures of the fingers, most commonly the ring and little fingers.

Nighy is a supporter of Crystal Palace F.C. He is a patron of the Crystal Palace Children&#x27;s Charity (CPCC) and of the Ann Craft Trust. He is also an honorary patron of the London children&#x27;s charity Scene &amp; Heard.

Nighy is a patron of the Milton Rooms, a new arts centre in Malton, North Yorkshire, along with Imelda Staunton, Jools Holland and Kathy Burke.

Nighy is a supporter of the Robin Hood tax campaign, and starred in a video in support of it.

Nighy supports &quot;total gender equality&quot;, noting in an interview he gave during the 2016 DIFF film festival that the highlighting of gender inequality problems in the film industry had influenced his choice of film roles. He has also spoken of his role in &quot;Pride&quot;, a film extolling the mutual support between the National Union of Miners and gay rights groups in the UK in the 1980s, as one of his most cherished.

In 2004, Nighy was a guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, presented by Sue Lawley. One of his chosen discs was &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; by The Who, so that he could practise his hobby of air guitar while marooned. As his luxury, he chose a boxed set of blues harp harmonicas and instruction book.

Nighy is noted for his bespoke navy suits. He was listed as one of the 50 best-dressed over-50s by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in March 2013 and one of &quot;GQ&quot; 50 best-dressed British men in 2015.

Nighy became a fan of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise during the production of &quot;Detective Pikachu&quot;, in which he played Howard Clifford. He has said that Mew is his favourite Pokémon.

For many years, Nighy struggled with substance issues, particularly alcoholism, a topic he rarely discusses, and has been a &quot;sober alcoholic&quot; since 17 May 1992. He gave up smoking in 2003.

During his twenties Nighy was in a band called the Love Ponies, and subsequently recorded a few songs.

Nighy resides in Pimlico, London.

<text>Peter Jozzeppi Burns (5 August 1959 – 23 October 2016) was an English singer, songwriter and television personality who formed the band Dead or Alive in 1980 during the new wave era and was the band&#x27;s lead vocalist and principal songwriter. He sold over 17 million albums and 36 million singles worldwide and also gave the songwriting and record production trio Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) their first UK No. 1 hit single. His first three albums all reached the UK Top 30, with &quot;Youthquake&quot; reaching the Top 10. Additionally, the band had seven UK Top 40 singles, two US Top 20 singles and another two singles which went to No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked Dead or Alive as one of the most successful dance artists of all time.

His debut album, &quot;Sophisticated Boom Boom&quot;, was released in 1984, producing a series of minor hits in the United Kingdom, most notably his version of &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot; (originally recorded by KC and the Sunshine Band) which gave the band their first UK Top 40 hit. Their second album, &quot;Youthquake&quot;, brought Burns and the band international recognition, largely due to the success of the lead single, &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; which reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 11 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1985. In 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song No. 5 in their list of &quot;The 100 Greatest UK No. 1s&quot; and &quot;Classic Pop&quot; ranked it No. 1 in their 2021 list of &quot;Top 40 Stock Aitken Waterman songs&quot;. The album also contained three other UK Top 30 hits and was certified Gold by both the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know&quot;, was released in 1986, scoring several further hit singles including &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; which peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and spent two weeks at No. 1 on the American dance chart in addition to &quot;Something in My House&quot; which peaked at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 3 on the American dance chart. In 1987, a greatest hits album was released entitled &quot;Rip It Up&quot; containing singles from their two prior albums and the following year, &quot;Nude&quot; was released with singles &quot;Turn Around and Count 2 Ten&quot; and &quot;Come Home with Me Baby&quot; being massive chart successes in America and Japan. Burns had a significant impact and influence on Japanese pop culture especially with J-pop and visual kei. He also achieved greater superstar status in the region than both Michael Jackson and Madonna.

Burns continued to achieve celebrity status in the British media following his appearance on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 4&quot;, in which he received attention for his verbal tirades against housemates Jodie Marsh and Traci Bingham. He finished in fifth place on the finale, receiving 13.6% of the vote, and appeared on further television reality shows, including as a presenter. Burns was noted for his deep baritone voice along with his flamboyant dress style, eyepatch, and androgynous gender bender appearance. Though he avoided labelling himself, Burns has been recognised as a gay icon and an individual who helped bring gay music into mainstream popularity. Burns was also the subject of tabloid speculation over his addiction to cosmetic surgery which bankrupted him and caused fatal health problems.

== Early life ==
Burns was born the youngest of two children on 5 August 1959, in Port Sunlight, Wirral. Burns&#x27;s mother, Evelina Maria Bettina Quittner Von Hudec, was German-born (Heidelberg) and, according to his autobiography, her first marriage was to a German &quot;Freiherr&quot;. As her father was Jewish, she moved to Vienna to escape the Nazis. At a tea dance in Vienna, she met an English soldier from Liverpool named Francis Burns. Until he was 5, Burns spoke only German which resulted in local children spending days outside his house shouting &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. From a young age, Burns developed a penchant for wearing costumes and he became obsessed with Native American culture going so far as to wear an Indian headdress constantly along with having his mother put up a tepee at his school playground. By his own admission, Burns was a lonely child who preferred drawing and painting to interacting with other children.

Burns stated that he inherited his love of fashion from his mother: &quot;She&#x27;d do five costume changes a day and had a real thing about make-up. Every day at 5:30 a.m., she&#x27;d barricade herself into the front room and do her face.&quot; Burns also later described his mother&#x27;s alcoholism, drug addiction, and multiple suicide attempts which were the result of her having suffered a nervous breakdown when she learned the fate of her family members during World War II. However, he maintained that she was &quot;absolutely the best mother in the world&quot; despite the child abuse he experienced:

For Burns, school was &quot;almost non-existent&quot;, and his mother frequently kept him away so he could spend the day with her. Burns was also endlessly taunted by teachers and peers, before being thrown out of school at 14 after being summoned to the headmaster&#x27;s office because he had arrived at school with &quot;no eyebrows, Harmony-red hair, and one gigantic earring&quot;. &quot;I dropped out of school, because it got to be too dangerous for somebody who looked a little different. At that time, I was experimenting with hair dyes and stuff like that, and I was going to a particularly macho-oriented school and causing too much controversy.&quot; Summarizing his time at school, Burns stated: &quot;I learnt nothing at school. I hated it. I was just really into David Bowie so I shaved off my eyebrows and dyed my hair orange, I was alienated in the seventies at school.&quot; During this time, Burns was also raped by a man who drove him to Raby Mere and threatened him with an air gun. &quot;I thought I should have been upset about that,&quot; wrote Burns. &quot;But I wasn&#x27;t.&quot;

== Career ==
=== Early career and band formation ===
Between 1977 and 1984, Burns worked as a shop assistant at Probe Records, a small independent record shop in Liverpool. Burns had been hired by Probe owner Geoff Davies due to his outlandish appearance (which included an &quot;eighteenth-century shepherd&#x27;s smock, an upside-down straw top hat with his dreads cascading out of the top, full make-up and massive heeled boots&quot;) that he hoped would attract customers. Burns later said that &quot;Geoff only employed me for the glamour&quot; and &quot;people would travel from Wales and Leeds, just to look at me. They used to call me King – I was like King Punk.&quot; After being hired, Burns would lash out at customers if he disliked their music choices, behaviour which was encouraged by Davies. &quot;I&#x27;m not lettin&#x27; yer waste yer money on that shite,&quot; Burns exclaimed to one customer who wanted to buy an LP record. BBC radio producer Graham Robertson recalled Burns&#x27;s time at Probe:


Despite his later success, Burns did not have ambitions to be a singer and said that he hated the sound of his voice, wishing he had been able to sing falsetto like Sylvester. He also had an uncomfortable relationship with the corporate music industry and expressed disgust at the way it functioned. He always refused to allow record company staff to hear his music before it was completed, which &quot;didn&#x27;t make [the executives] very pleased&quot; and refused to promote his work; &quot;I used to let it sink or swim on its own.&quot;

In 1977, Burns formed a punk band with contemporaries Julian Cope, Pete Wylie, and Phil Hurst, calling themselves The Mystery Girls. They only had one performance (opening for Sham 69 at Eric&#x27;s Club in Liverpool in November 1977) before disintegrating. Cope stated that Burns&#x27;s performing style drew on that of the transgender punk performer Jayne County and Wylie recalled that &quot;his head looked like someone had melted a load of black vinyl down into a kind of space quiff.&quot; Burns continued in early-1979 with a new band, Nightmares in Wax (originally called Rainbows Over Nagasaki), featuring a gothic post-punk sound, with backing from keyboardist Martin Healy, guitarist Mick Reid, bassist Rob Jones (who left to be replaced by Walter Ogden), and drummer Paul Hornby (who also exited after the band&#x27;s formation to be replaced by Phil Hurst).

The group played their first gig supporting Wire at Eric&#x27;s Club in July 1979, and recorded demos which included a cover of the Simon Dupree and the Big Sound song &quot;Kites&quot;, a feature of their early shows. Although signed to the Eric&#x27;s Records label, their only release, a three-track 7-inch EP entitled &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;, appeared in March 1980 on Inevitable Records. A 12-inch single featuring two of the tracks from the EP, &quot;Black Leather&quot; and &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, was released in 1985. The EP featured &quot;Black Leather&quot;, which turned halfway into KC and the Sunshine Band&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;.

The band went through several line-up changes over the next three years while recording a series of independent singles. In 1980, after replacing several members, Burns changed the band&#x27;s name to Dead or Alive. Dead or Alive&#x27;s singles started charting on the UK Indie Chart, beginning with 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; reaching No. 7. This prompted major label Epic Records to sign the band in 1983. Their first release for Epic was the single &quot;Misty Circles&quot;, which appeared at No. 100 on the major UK Singles Chart in 1983. Two more singles co-produced by Zeus B. Held (&quot;What I Want&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;) were released but mainstream success continued to elude the band.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Sophisticated Boom Boom&quot;, was released in May 1984 and featured their first Top 40 UK single, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;, a cover of the 1975 hit by KC and the Sunshine Band. That song, along with &quot;Misty Circles&quot;, were also hits on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album was a minor success in the UK where it peaked at No. 29. As Burns and his band achieved greater media exposure, his eccentric and androgynous appearance often led to comparisons with Culture Club and its lead singer Boy George as well as &quot;Calling Your Name&quot; singer Marilyn. Burns would describe producing his first album as &quot;the most joyous experience of my life, full of happy memories, because there was no commercial pressure on us.&quot;

During his time at Liverpool, Burns became acquainted with Courtney Love shortly after she moved to the area in 1982 using money from a small trust fund. When Burns became &quot;the local celebrity punk&quot;, he remembered how Love &quot;would call me all sorts of names on the street and it got to the stage where I just sort of loved her for that. She had, like, a complete lack of respect for the divinity I had in the city at the time.&quot;

Boy George, in his autobiography &quot;Take It Like a Man&quot;, said that Burns was &quot;a local disco celebrity in Liverpool, like Philip Sallon in London.&quot; He also noted, &quot;I&#x27;d never met Burns, but knew of his reputation for being evil.&quot; Along with working at Probe, Burns also worked as a clothes designer and was the owner of a small fashion shop in Liverpool&#x27;s Casey Street. Burns often informed his customers that the clothes they bought from him were &quot;crap&quot; even going so far as to mock people he spotted around town wearing his designs.

=== Chart success ===
The band released its second album &quot;Youthquake&quot; (US No. 31, UK No. 9) in May 1985, produced by the then-fledgling production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, and Pete Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW). Desiring to move on from the sound of the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;Sophisticated Boom Boom&quot;, Burns wanted &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; to be produced by the little-known team, in the Hi-NRG style of their 1984 UK hits &quot;You Think You&#x27;re a Man&quot; by Divine, and &quot;Whatever I Do (Wherever I Go)&quot; by Hazell Dean. Recording of the single was plagued by arguments between the band and producers, but became the band&#x27;s only song to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart after lingering outside the Top 40 for over two months. The song proved to be SAW&#x27;s first chart-topping single. The track also hit No. 11 in the US and No. 1 in Canada.

In a 2009 interview discussing the song, Burns disputed the Hi-NRG label, saying &quot;to me it was just disco&quot;, and describing the song as &quot;a pop hit, not a hi-NRG hit&quot;. Burns later said he had wanted to make a &quot;glittery disco record&quot;, while Pete Waterman, asked to define the song&#x27;s sound, said it was &quot;techno-disco; without a question that&#x27;s what it was. It was new technology playing Motown; that&#x27;s all it was. Taking out the musicians and bringing in technology for the first time.&quot; Burns would later criticise SAW for their methods, describing that &quot;they took our sound and just basically wheeled it off with a load of other imbeciles, and that makes me a bit sour.&quot; Burns stated in his autobiography that he composed &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; by using two existing songs:

Burns claimed the song was &quot;completed&quot; by the time the producers were then chosen to work on it, stating that &quot;the record companies don&#x27;t trust a band to go into the studio without a producer&quot;. However, according to Burns, the record company was unenthusiastic about the single to such an extent that Burns had to take out a £2,500 loan to record it. Afterward, he recalled, &quot;the record company said it was awful&quot; and the band had to fund production of the song&#x27;s video themselves. Additionally, Burns said that 12-inch singles comprised over 70% of the original sales of &quot;You Spin Me Round&quot;, and because these were regarded by the record label as promotional tools rather than sales, the band had to threaten legal action against the label before they received the royalties on them.

Other album tracks released as singles included &quot;Lover Come Back To Me&quot; (No. 11), &quot;In Too Deep&quot; (No. 14), and &quot;My Heart Goes Bang (Get Me to the Doctor)&quot; (No. 23) which all reached the UK Top 30. Despite the international chart-topping success of &quot;Youthquake&quot; and its lead single, Burns said it was the album that he was &quot;most dissatisfied with&quot; and recalled that &quot;one of the unhappiest days of my life was when &quot;Spin Me&quot; reached No. 1 – and I mean really unhappy. Because I knew it would be downhill all the way after that.&quot; Burns had a fear of success and hoped that his singles would not chart highly. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want too high positions because I didn&#x27;t want to lose my life,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I thought, if it happens it happens, but if it doesn&#x27;t – phew!&quot;

In late 1986, Dead or Alive released their third album, &quot;Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know&quot; (US No. 52, UK No. 27). Production of the album was marred by more fights between the band and SAW, with the latter frustrated by the band&#x27;s refusal to branch into house music, and Burns being unwilling to hand over songwriting duties to the producers. SAW&#x27;s recording engineer Karen Hewitt recalled the singer appeared to thrive on his often explosive and confrontational dynamic with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken during the album sessions. Matt Aitken confessed to struggling with Burns&#x27; vocal experimentation on the second SAW-produced album, including what he described as the introduction of a displeasing yodel.

The lead single &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; became a modest UK hit, peaking at No. 31, but was more successful in the US where it reached No. 15 on the US Hot 100, and No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart. Following a fraught six-month recording session with producers Stock Aitken Waterman, which was marked by fights and disagreements between the band, record company and producers over the sound of their new material, Burns claimed he struggled to get Epic to commit to a release schedule for the single. He said this changed when Bananarama had major success with their Dead or Alive-inspired cover of &quot;Venus&quot;, which Burns claimed encouraged the label to schedule &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; for release. Later, Burns blamed the song&#x27;s disappointing chart run in his home country on his then-ongoing war with his UK label, alleging that the company had failed to press and distribute enough copies of the single to make it a hit, and claiming the band had lost out on 67,000 UK sales as a result.

Three more singles from the album were released, the most successful in the UK was &quot;Something in My House&quot; (No. 12), tonally Gothic and with a sleeve depicting Burns in front of what appears to be a Satanic altar, featuring an inverted cross. Originally conceived by Burns as a Halloween release, the horror-themed &quot;Something in My House&quot; was delayed until late December in the UK, amid wrangling between the band and their record company, with the latter feeling the track was &quot;too brutal&quot; to be a single.

Clashes between the band and the label continued over the song&#x27;s music video, with Epic Records reportedly objecting to a &quot;mildly suggestive&quot; sequence involving Burns and a banana. &quot;By the time we got to &#x27;Something in My House&#x27;, I felt I wanted to express myself on film, as well as record, amuse myself, show my sense of humour,&quot; Burns wrote on the liner notes to his &quot;Evolution: The Videos&quot; compilation DVD. &quot;Well apparently the manner in which I &#x27;peeled a banana&#x27; seemed to work against me/us! And, it was downhill all the way after that.&quot;

Recording of the song was also fraught, with Burns alleging that producer Mike Stock erased his original vocal take after objecting to the singer&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;wicked queen&quot;; a lyrical double entendre implying reference to a gay relationship. &quot;We would butt heads so fucking badly; it was unbelievable,&quot; Burns told journalist James Arena in his book &quot;Europe&#x27;s Stars of 80s Dance Pop&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s why we eventually walked away from them. For instance, there was a lyric from &#x27;Something in My House&#x27; where I make reference to a wicked queen. &quot;The actual producer, Mike Stock stopped me and said I couldn&#x27;t use that term because it would mean the record is about gay people. I was like, &#x27;Fuck this, it&#x27;s going on!&#x27; They actually wiped the original vocal, but then Pete Waterman came back and said, &#x27;Let him do it the way he wants to.&#x27;&quot;

Despite the reservations of the label and producers, the track proved to be Dead or Alive&#x27;s biggest hit in the UK since &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot; and was the only single from their third album to earn a UK Top 20 placement. The song also proved to be the act&#x27;s final Top 40 hit with an original release in the UK, and their last Top 20 hit in Australia. A 12-inch version of the song, the &quot;Mortevicar Mix&quot;, featured scenes from Nosferatu and sampling of dialogue from the soundtrack of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and a sampling from the trailer of George A. Romero&#x27;s film &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. Another highly controversial 12-inch white label mix, known as &quot;Naughty XXX&quot;, was released to club DJs, featuring a series of stronger dialogue clips from &quot;The Exorcist&quot; – with the track described as &quot;unique&quot; in its capacity as the only known example of a &quot;filthy, obscene [and] sexually explicit&quot; Stock Aitken Waterman record. A third single, &quot;Hooked on Love&quot;, failed to make the UK Top 40 amid Burns&#x27; battle with the label over their refusal to prioritise his preferred mix, which featured a &quot;Gothic&quot; overtone.

In 1986, Burns recommended model Mandy Smith to Pete Waterman. Smith was already well-known in the British tabloids due to her relationship with Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman, which started when she was 13. Smith became the very first artist signed to Waterman&#x27;s PWL Records in September 1986 when she was 16-years-old. In 1987, Dead or Alive released their greatest hits album &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, and a concert tour of the same name with dates in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Film footage was recorded at two shows at Tokyo&#x27;s Nippon Budokan on 9 October and at Osaka&#x27;s Osaka-jō Hall on 11 October, and released on video cassette (VHS) and Laserdisc that same year under the title &quot;Rip It Up Live&quot;. The concert was eventually issued as bonus material for the first time on DVD as part of the 2003 compilation release. Due to their immense popularity in the region, Michael Jackson was forced to reschedule his Japanese tour dates during his Bad World Tour so as not to conflict with Dead or Alive. One contemporary Japanese newspaper even ran the headline, &quot;Forget Madonna, we&#x27;ve got Pete Burns!&quot;

During this time, Burns turned down offers to tour with Madonna for her Who&#x27;s That Girl World Tour as well as with Bon Jovi to be with his mother when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Burns later recalled: &quot;A manager left an answerphone message telling me, &#x27;If you don&#x27;t want your career to die of cancer like your mother, you should pack your bags.&#x27;&quot; Burns&#x27;s mother died in 1987 and her death led Burns to struggle to write new musical material. This coupled along with his tour refusals adversely affected his music career and caused him to subsequently reduce his public profile in later years. &quot;I felt, well, nothing&#x27;s worth going on for,&quot; he stated. &quot;I had a nervous breakdown after she died and couldn&#x27;t work.&quot;

In mid-1988, Dead or Alive released the self-produced &quot;Nude&quot; (US No. 106, UK No. 82). In 2021, &quot;RetroPop Magazine&quot; retrospectively described &quot;Nude&quot; as the &quot;perfect Dead or Alive album&quot; and &quot;their strongest offering overall&quot;. During the album&#x27;s production Tim Lever and Mike Percy were fired from the band. The pair later formed careers as mixers and producers; both owned and operated &quot;Steelworks Studios&quot; in Sheffield and experienced success writing and mixing songs for acts like S Club 7, Blue, and Robbie Williams. From the information booklet in Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI, Burns stated:
The album featured the single &quot;Turn Around and Count 2 Ten&quot; which reached No. 2 in the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and No. 1 for a record-breaking seventeen-weeks in Japan. It was followed by the singles &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart and &quot;Come Home with Me Baby&quot; which spent thirteen-weeks at No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play due to a popular remix by producer Lewis Martineé. However, &quot;Come Home with Me Baby&quot; and the other singles struggled in the UK. This was attributed to the lyrics of the song, which encouraged casual sex during the AIDs epidemic.

Additionally, despite strong customer demand, the US record company refused to release it as a proper single (claiming they objected to the male dancers in the music video) which prevented the song from becoming a major hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1989, to support his &quot;Nude&quot; album and the release of its companion remix album &quot;Nude – Remade Remodelled&quot;, Burns toured with fellow Stock Aitken Waterman acts Sinitta and Kylie Minogue in Asia and Europe on the ensemble &quot;Disco in Dream&quot; concert tour. On 6 October, Burns gave a performance at the Tokyo Dome, the largest concert venue in Japan (with a seating capacity of 55,000 people), which was broadcast on the NHK television network.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===
In 1990, the band produced their next studio album, &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 1)&quot;, although their only successful record deal was in Japan where the album peaked at No. 27 on the Japanese Albums Chart. The band had begun to produce &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 2)&quot;, however the album was shelved until it was finished in 2021. An acoustic album &quot;Love, Pete&quot; was also made available during a US personal appearance tour in 1992 and was since widely bootlegged with the title &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 2): The Acoustic Sessions&quot;. Pete strongly criticized its subsequent distribution.

In the early-1990s, Burns and Coy signed with Pete Waterman&#x27;s PWL Records and recording was started on new tracks co-written and produced by Mike Stock, but the sessions were aborted when Stock abruptly quit over his dissatisfaction with his share of publishing royalties on the new material. Work on new material recommenced with PWL staffer Barry Stone taking over co-production duties. The band released a new single in 1994, a cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Rebel&quot;, under the name &quot;International Chrysis&quot;, named after the late transsexual nightclub performer. An initial demo of the track, which featured new lyrics written by Burns, was blocked by Bowie – who legally denied permission to use new lyrics, and also unsuccessfully requested the track not be covered by Burns at all.

Remixed versions of tracks from &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 1)&quot; were later re-recorded for the band&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Nukleopatra&quot; album which was their sixth studio album. While the album was released as scheduled in Japan, the planned European release was pulled when Burns left PWL Records after Pete Waterman refused his request to use Paul Oakenfold and other remixers to work on further singles, and instead insisted he wanted to write and produce for the band himself. In 1997, Burns claimed that some of the song covers were included as &quot;album fillers&quot; after studio time to write new material was cut short when &quot;the record label started to fall to bits&quot;.

In 1999, Burns covered Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Why&#x27;s It So Hard&quot; from &quot;Erotica&quot; for &quot;Virgin Voices: A Tribute to Madonna&quot;, a compilation album featuring various artists covering her most iconic songs. In 2000, Dead or Alive released &quot;Fragile&quot;, a collection of remakes with several new tracks and covers including U2&#x27;s &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; and Nick Kamen&#x27;s &quot;I Promised Myself&quot;. The first song on the album, &quot;Hit and Run Lover&quot;, was a hit single peaking at No. 2 on the Japanese charts. A new remix album, &quot;Unbreakable: The Fragile Remixes&quot;, was released in 2001. This was followed in 2003 with a greatest hits album entitled &quot;&quot; along with a video compilation that was also released on DVD. &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; was re-released as a single to promote the album with it reaching No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart.
=== Solo music career and collaborations ===
In the mid-1990s, Burns collaborated with the Italian Eurodance-duo Glam to produce the single &quot;Sex Drive&quot;, which was later re-recorded for &quot;Nukleopatra&quot;. In 2004, Burns enjoyed solo success with the Pet Shop Boys-produced track &quot;Jack and Jill Party&quot;. The track reached No. 75 in the UK Singles Chart. On 7 September 2010, Burns&#x27;s solo single &quot;Never Marry an Icon&quot;, produced and co-written by the Dirty Disco, was released to the iTunes Store. The single was released by band member Steve Coy&#x27;s label, &quot;Bristar Records&quot;. That year, Burns also appeared with Dutch Eurodance group Vengaboys in the music video for their song &quot;Rocket to Uranus&quot;.

=== Media career ===
In December 2003, the BBC apologised to its viewers after Burns swore once on its pre-9pm watershed &quot;Liquid News&quot; show when asked about his views on the Michael Jackson trial. Burns also appeared in the first episode of the ninth series of the UK version of &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;. His partner Michael Simpson went to live with former Page 3 model Leah Newman, while Burns lived with Newman&#x27;s partner, the footballer Neil Ruddock. On 2 November 2006, Burns presented an ITV program titled &quot;Pete Burns&#x27; Cosmetic Surgery Nightmares&quot;. From 8 October 2007, to 5 December 2007, &quot;Pete&#x27;s PA&quot; aired on Living following Burns as he searched for a new personal assistant (PA). In 2008, Burns was also the subject of an episode for the show &quot;Psychic Therapy&quot; on the Biography Channel where he was interviewed by medium Gordon Smith.

In January 2006, Burns appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 4&quot;, eventually reaching fifth on the show&#x27;s final episode. During the program, he declared that one of his coats was made out of gorilla fur – this caused outrage among animal rights activists as unlicensed gorilla fur is illegal in the United Kingdom. Police subsequently confiscated the coat and tests were performed on it that revealed that it was not gorilla but was made out of the fur of colobus monkeys which are an endangered species whose fur requires a licence, although experts believed that the fur had been imported before it became illegal to import colobus fur in 1975. Burns acted as a co-host on the 2013 E4 show &quot;The Body Shocking Show&quot; and that same year he also co-hosted an episode of Celebrity Wedding Planner. His final musical performance was on &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side&quot; in May 2015 with his last public appearance being on &quot;Celebrity Botched Up Bodies&quot; in September 2016.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships ===
Burns married Lynne Corlett in Liverpool on 8 August 1980, after he met Corlett in a hair salon where they both worked. &quot;I was immediately attracted to Pete,&quot; Corlett later said. &quot;He was as outrageous as I was, and we both had so much in common. At first, they [Corlett&#x27;s parents] thought Pete was just a gay friend of mine. They thought he was sweet and nice. But they didn&#x27;t like it when they found out we were serious.&quot;

Discussing the wedding, Burns said: &quot;The only thing that spoiled it was that the man in the registry office had to go and make a feeble joke by asking which one of us was the bride.&quot; They divorced in 2006 and Burns entered a civil partnership with his partner Michael Simpson shortly afterward in 2007. According to Corlett, Burns &quot;was seeing Michael when we were still married but I knew about that.&quot; She also said that Burns was &quot;very honest&quot; about his romantic relationship with Simpson and said that their divorce was &quot;very amicable&quot;.

===Gender and sexuality===
On the topic of his sexuality, Burns stated, &quot;[People] always want to know – am I gay, bi, trans or what? I say, forget all that. There&#x27;s got to be a completely different terminology and I&#x27;m not aware if it&#x27;s been invented yet. I&#x27;m just Pete.&quot; He also said that he always identified himself as male and never had intentions of being a woman: &quot;It freaks me that someone could think I was a woman. Don&#x27;t get me wrong – I love women; I love men, too, and I&#x27;m very proud to be a man.&quot;

=== Health and legal issues ===
Burns was known for his addiction to cosmetic surgery and stated in a 2016 interview: &quot;The number of surgeries I&#x27;ve had is probably 300. I hope when I&#x27;m 80 and I get to heaven God doesn&#x27;t recognise me.&quot; Burns had his first cosmetic procedure (a rhinoplasty) in 1984. He explained: &quot;I realised I was going to be a visual entity and that I had to look good. I had a broken nose. In the punk days somebody head butted me in Liverpool, and it went over to one side. When you&#x27;re young, self-conscious and standing in front of a camera and the photographers are whispering, &#x27;Can we just turn his head to the left because he&#x27;s got a lump on his nose,&#x27; you think, &#x27;Well, I&#x27;ll do something about it&#x27;.&quot;

According to Burns: &quot;The operation was a disaster — my nose completely caved in on one side. I&#x27;m at home recovering, when I get a call telling me I&#x27;m on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; next Tuesday. That&#x27;s why I had to wear that eyepatch. It wasn&#x27;t a fashion statement, it was practical.&quot; Despite the botched rhinoplasty, Burns would go on to have extensive polyacrylamide injections into his lips, cheek implants, many more rhinoplasties and lots of tattoos. During a 2010 ABC interview Burns explained: &quot;I see myself as my own clay, and I was remodelling it.&quot; In early-2006, Burns revealed in another interview that he had spent his life savings on 18 months of reconstructive surgery after a cosmetic procedure on his lips went wrong.

The botched lip augmentation led to an infection in his lips caused by the injectable filler used and it spread to the rest of his face, leaving holes in his skin which would excrete yellow fluid. Additional surgery-related health problems experienced by Burns included pulmonary embolisms and near-fatal blood clots. In March 2009, Burns was admitted to a London hospital after collapsing from a kidney ailment. He was diagnosed with seven large kidney stones, which were removed with laser surgery.

In January 2007, Burns sued his cosmetic surgeon, Maurizio Viel, who performed his faulty lip surgery, for £1 million; he eventually reached an out-of-court settlement for £450,000. Paparazzi followed Burns around after his arrest for assault in 2006 (the charges were later dropped), and his attempts to revive his career premiered in the documentary &quot;Pete Burns Unspun&quot; on LivingTV. Burns was declared bankrupt in December 2014 and was evicted from a rented flat in April 2015 for non-payment of over £34,000 in rent.

== Death, funeral and legacy ==
Burns died in London following a sudden cardiac arrest on 23 October 2016, at the age of 57. Burns was due to appear on the British talk show &quot;Loose Women&quot; to promote the &quot;Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI&quot; box set on 24 October, the day after he died, but pulled out the week prior due to &quot;ill health&quot;. In May 2016, Burns had previously sparked concerns when he was seen in public appearing bloated and dishevelled.

People who paid tribute to him after his death included Boy George, who described Burns as &quot;one of our great true eccentrics&quot;, Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears, who described Burns as a &quot;true original, a treasure of a human being&quot; and former MP George Galloway, who had appeared with him on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and said Burns was &quot;a cross between Oscar Wilde and Dorothy Parker... you don&#x27;t get more brilliant than that.&quot;

Soft Cell musician Marc Almond tweeted: &quot;We&#x27;ve had some mad times with Pete but he was a one off creation, a fabulous, fantastic, brilliant creature and always sweet to me.&quot; Joe Musker, a former Dead or Alive drummer, told BBC Radio 5 Live: &quot;He was the ace face in Liverpool. He was just so flamboyant and just right out there with his dress and that. He always looked absolutely amazing and it was a pleasure to work with him.&quot;

On 29 October, the opening celebrity dance routine for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; was performed to &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;. After the number, hosts Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly paid tribute to Burns and sent their condolences to his family. Boy George paid for the costs of his funeral, despite the two artists&#x27; rivalry during their parallel music careers, and the fact that Burns accused him of appropriating his image.

In 2023, &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; was covered by Netta as part of the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 tribute to music from Liverpool. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2023, English media personality and presenter of &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Bit on the Side&quot;, Rylan Clark, sang the song in a duet with Rick Astley, and danced with him, on Astley&#x27;s BBC One New Year&#x27;s Eve special.

In 2024, previously unseen photographs of Burns were put on display in an exhibition entitled &quot;Total Stranger&quot; in his hometown of Port Sunlight. Photographer and former Dead or Alive manager Francesco Mellina said the display was &quot;a tribute to Pete and his career&quot;. Jean Milton, curator of the exhibition and Director of Heritage at Port Sunlight Village Trust, said: &quot;This exhibition will hopefully bring Pete to a whole new audience and inspire a new generation to be true to who they are and not be afraid to create their own path.&quot;

<text>Étienne Émile Marie Boutroux (; ; 28 July 1845 – 22 November 1921) was an eminent 19th-century French philosopher of science and religion, and a historian of philosophy. He was a firm opponent of materialism in science. He was a spiritual philosopher who defended the idea that religion and science are compatible at a time when the power of science was rising inexorably. His work is overshadowed in the English-speaking world by that of the more celebrated Henri Bergson. He was elected membership of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1912 to the Académie française.

==Biography==
Émile Boutroux was born at Montrouge, now in the Hauts-de-Seine &quot;département&quot;, near Paris. He attended the lycée Napoléon (now lycée Henri IV), and graduated in 1865 to the École Normale Supérieure. He then continued his education at Heidelberg University between 1869 and 1870 where he was taught by Hermann von Helmholtz and encountered German philosophy. In 1874 he defended two doctoral theses: one, &quot;De Veritatibus aeternis apud Cartesium&quot; (&quot;On Eternal Truths According to Descartes&quot;), under the supervision of Félix Ravaisson; and the other, &quot;De la contingence des lois de la nature&quot; (&quot;The Contingency of the Laws of Nature&quot;), under Jules Lachelier.

His first employment was the post of philosophy professor at the lycée in Caen.

Between 1874 and 1876 Boutroux taught at the Faculty of Letters at the University of Nancy and while there he fell in love with and married Aline Poincaré the sister of the scientist and mathematician Henri Poincaré. In 1880 his son, Pierre, was born. Pierre Boutroux was himself to become a distinguished mathematician and historian of science.

In 1888 Boutroux was made professor of history of modern philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris.

He was elected a member of Academy of the Moral and Political Sciences in 1898 and in 1902 he became Director of the Thiers Foundation, a residency for France&#x27;s brightest students. He was elected to the Académie Française in 1912.

Boutroux died in November 1921.

<doc id="463551" wikidata="Q652695" url="?curid=463551" title="Shortbread">
<text>Shortbread or shortie is a traditional Scottish biscuit usually made from one part white sugar, two parts butter and three to four parts plain wheat flour. Shortbread does not contain any leavening, such as baking powder or baking soda. Shortbread is widely associated with Christmas and Hogmanay festivities in Scotland, and some Scottish brands are exported around the world.

== History ==

Shortbread originated in Scotland. Although it was prepared during much of the 12th century, and probably benefited from cultural exchange with French pastry chefs during the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland, the refinement of shortbread is popularly credited to Mary, Queen of Scots in the 16th century. Despite the enduring popular association, evidence for any connection between Mary and shortbread&#x27;s origin is sparse. 

Triangular wedges of shortbread became known as &quot;petticoat tails&quot;, and this form of shortbread has become particularly associated with Mary, Queen of Scots. It has been suggested that a French term for the wedges of shortbread was &quot;petits gâteaux&quot; or &quot;petites gatelles&quot; – little cakes, and this became &quot;petticoat tails&quot;. It is now thought the Scots term derives from the decorated round edge of the segments which resemble petticoats.

The first printed recipe, in 1736, was from a Scotswoman named Mrs McLintock.

Shortbread was expensive and reserved as a luxury for special occasions such as Christmas, Hogmanay (Scottish New Year&#x27;s Eve), and weddings. In Scotland, it was traditional to break a decorated shortbread cake (infar-cake or dreaming bread) over the head of a new bride on the entrance of her new house. Shortbread was also given as a gift.

==Name==
Shortbread is so named because of its crumbly texture (from an old meaning of the word &quot;short&quot;, as opposed to &quot;long&quot;, or stretchy). The cause of this texture is its high fat content, provided by the butter. The short or crumbly texture is a result of the fat inhibiting the formation of long protein (gluten) strands. The related word &quot;shortening&quot; refers to any fat that may be added to produce a &quot;short&quot; (crumbly) texture.

In British English, &quot;shortbread&quot; and &quot;shortcake&quot; have been synonyms for several centuries, starting in the 1400s; both referred to the crisp, crumbly cookie-type baked good, rather than a softer cake. The &quot;short-cake&quot; mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, first published in 1602, was a reference to the cookie-style of shortbread.

In American English, shortbread is different from shortcake. Shortcake usually has a chemical leavening agent such as baking powder, which gives it a different, softer texture, and it was normally split and filled with fruit. The most popular example of this difference is strawberry shortcake.

== Ingredients ==
Other ingredients are often substituted for part of the flour to alter the texture. Rice flour or semolina makes it grittier, and cornflour makes it more tender. Bere or oat flour may be added for flavour.

Modern recipes also often deviate from the original by splitting the sugar into equal parts granulated and icing sugar and many add a portion of salt. 

Spices and ingredients such as almonds may be added.

== Shapes ==

Shortbread is commonly formed into one of three shapes: 

* one large circle, which is divided into segments as soon as it is taken out of the oven (&quot;petticoat tails&quot;, which may have been named from the French &quot;petits cotés&quot;, a pointed biscuit eaten with wine, or &quot;petites galettes,&quot; the old French term for little cakes. This term may also reference the shape of a petticoat); 
* individual round biscuits (&quot;shortbread rounds&quot;); or 
* a thick (¾&quot; or 2 cm) oblong slab cut into &quot;fingers&quot;.

Shortbread may also be made in quadrant-shaped farls.

In one of the oldest shapes, bakers pinched the edges of a shortbread round to suggest the rays of the sun.

The stiff dough retains its shape well during cooking. The biscuits are often patterned before cooking, usually with the tines of a fork or with a springerle-type mold. Shortbread is sometimes shaped into hearts and other shapes for special occasions.

==Varieties==

Variations in ingredients for some recipes include the optional addition of caraway seeds to petticoat tails, coriander and caraway in Goosnargh, egg yolk and cream in Ayrshire, citrus peel and almonds in Pitcaithly bannock, and demerara sugar in Dorset.

Millionaire&#x27;s shortbread, also called &quot;caramel squares&quot;, is a modern variation, in which shortbread is topped with caramel and chocolate.

== Cultural associations ==
In ancient Scottish folklore, sun-shaped cakes, such as shortbread, had magical powers over the Sun during the Scottish New Year&#x27;s Eve.

Shortbread originated in and is generally associated with Scotland, but due to its popularity it is also made in the rest of the United Kingdom and similar biscuits are also made in Denmark, Ireland and Sweden. The Scottish version is the best-known and is widely exported.

Scottish chef John Quigley, of Glasgow&#x27;s Red Onion, describes shortbread as &quot;the jewel in the crown&quot; of Scottish baking.

An early variety of shortbread, using ginger, was reportedly eaten during sittings of the Parliament of Scotland, and therefore the variety was sometimes called &quot;Parliament cake&quot; or &quot;Parlies&quot; into the 19th century. The biscuits were sold in Mrs Flockhart&#x27;s tavern and shop in Bristo Street in Edinburgh&#x27;s Potterrow. Known as &quot;Luckie Fykie&quot;, the landlady was thought to be the inspiration for Mrs Flockhart in Walter Scott&#x27;s Waverley.

In the UK tax code, shortbread is taxed as a flour confection (baked good) rather than as a common biscuit.

<doc id="463558" wikidata="Q866948" url="?curid=463558" title="Conpoy">
<text>Conpoy or dried scallop is a type of Cantonese dried seafood product that is made from the adductor muscle of scallops. The smell of conpoy is marine, pungent, and reminiscent of certain salt-cured meats. Its taste is rich in umami due to its high content of various free amino acids, such as glycine, alanine, and glutamic acid. It is also rich in nucleic acids such as inosinic acid, amino acid byproducts such as taurine, and minerals, such as calcium and zinc.

Conpoy is produced by cooking raw scallops and then drying them.

==Terminology==
&quot;Conpoy&quot; is a loanword from the Cantonese pronunciation of (), which literally means &quot;dried shell(fish)&quot;.

==Usage==

In Hong Kong, conpoy from two types of scallops are common. Conpoy made from &quot;Atrina pectinata&quot; or &#x27; () from mainland China is small and milder in taste. &quot;Mizuhopecten yessoensis&quot; or &#x27; (), a sea scallop imported from Japan (&quot;hotategai&quot;, in Japanese), produces a conpoy that is stronger and richer in taste .

As with many dried foods, conpoy was originally made as a way to preserve seafood in times of excess. In more recent times its use in cuisine has been elevated to gourmet status. Conpoy has a strong and distinctive flavor that can be easily identified when used in rice congee, stir fries, stews, and sauces.

XO sauce, a seasoning used for frying vegetables or seafoods in Cantonese cuisine, contains significant quantities of conpoy. For example, the Lee Kum Kee formulation lists conpoy as the third ingredient on its label.

<doc id="463560" wikidata="Q537984" url="?curid=463560" title="Caspar Bartholin the Younger">
<text>Caspar Bartholin the Younger (; Latinized: &quot;Caspar Bartholin Secundus&quot;; 10 September 1655 – 11 June 1738), was a Danish anatomist who first described the &quot;Bartholin&#x27;s gland&quot; in the 17th century. The discovery of the Bartholin&#x27;s gland is sometimes mistakenly credited to his grandfather.

==Early life and education==
Bartholin was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He came from an eminent family. He is the grandson of theologian and anatomist Caspar Bartholin the Elder (1585–1629) and son of physician, mathematician, and theologian Thomas Bartholin (1616–1680). His uncle was scientist and physician Rasmus Bartholin (1625–1698).

==Academic career==

Bartholin started his medical studies in 1671 at the age of 16.
From 1674, he studied in the Netherlands, France and Italy.
When he returned to Denmark in 1677, he was appointed lecturer of natural philosophy at the University of Copenhagen.
The following year he gained his medical degree and was made full professor at the University of Copenhagen.
He described the Bartholin glands which bear his name in 1677. 
He was rector of the University of Copenhagen from 1687 to 1688.

In 1690, he left his academic career to become a high court judge, becoming Procurator General in 1719, and Deputy of Finance in 1724. In about 1696, Danish-born French anatomist Jacob B. Winslow (1669–1760) was Bartholin&#x27;s prosector. He received the Order of the Dannebrog in 1729.

==Hagestedgård==
Bartholin inherited the Hagestedgård manor house and estate at Holbæk from his father in 1680. He sold the estate to Laurits Jacobsen in 1686 but reacquired it in 1695. He then sold it, for a second time, to Ursula von Putbus in 1704.

<doc id="463570" wikidata="Q2508152" url="?curid=463570" title="Fredonian Rebellion">
<text>The Fredonian Rebellion or Texan revolt of 1826 (December 21, 1826 – January 31, 1827) was the first attempt by Texans to secede from Mexico. The settlers, led by Empresario Haden Edwards, declared independence from Mexican Texas and created the Republic of Fredonia near Nacogdoches. The short-lived republic encompassed the land the Mexican government had granted to Edwards in 1825 and included areas that had been previously settled. Edwards&#x27;s actions soon alienated the established residents, and the increasing hostilities between them and settlers recruited by Edwards led Víctor Blanco of the Mexican government to revoke Edwards&#x27;s contract.

In late December 1826, a group of Edwards&#x27;s supporters took control of the region by arresting and removing from office several municipality officials affiliated with the established residents. Supporters declared their independence from Mexico. Although the nearby Cherokee tribe initially signed a treaty to support the new republic because a prior agreement with the Mexican government negotiated by Chief Richard Fields was ignored, overtures from Mexican authorities and respected &quot;empresario&quot;, Stephen F. Austin, convinced tribal leaders to repudiate the rebellion. On January 31, 1827, a force of over 100 Mexican soldiers and 275 Texian Militia marched into Nacogdoches to restore order. Haden Edwards and his brother Benjamin Edwards fled to the United States. Chief Fields was killed by his own tribe. A local merchant was arrested and sentenced to death but later paroled.

The rebellion led Mexican president Guadalupe Victoria to increase the military presence in the area. As a result, several hostile tribes in the area halted their raids on settlements and agreed to a peace treaty. The Comanche abided by this treaty for many years. Fearing that, through the rebellion, the United States hoped to gain control of Texas, the Mexican government severely curtailed immigration to the region from the US. The new immigration law was bitterly opposed by colonists and caused increasing dissatisfaction with Mexican rule. Some historians consider the Fredonian Rebellion to be the beginning of the Texas Revolution. In the words of one historian, the rebellion was &quot;premature, but it sparked the powder for later success&quot;.

==Background==
After winning independence in 1821, several of Spain&#x27;s colonies in the New World joined together to create a new country, Mexico. The country divided itself into several states, and the area known as Mexican Texas became part of the border state Coahuila y Tejas. To assist in governing the large area, the state created several departments; all of Texas was included in the Department of Béxar. The department was further subdivided into municipalities, which were each governed by an &quot;alcalde&quot;, similar to a modern-day mayor. A large portion of East Texas, ranging from the Sabine to the Trinity rivers and from the Gulf Coast to the Red River, became part of the municipality of Nacogdoches. Most residents of the municipality were Spanish-speaking families who had occupied their land for generations. An increasing number were English-speaking residents who had immigrated illegally during the Mexican War of Independence. Many of the immigrants were adventurers who had arrived as part of various military filibustering groups, which had attempted to create independent republics within Texas during Spanish rule.

For better control of the sparsely populated border region, in 1824 the Mexican federal government passed the General Colonization Law to allow legal immigration into Texas. Under the law, each state would set its own requirements for immigration. After some debate, on March 24, 1825, Coahuila y Tejas authorized a system granting land to &quot;empresarios&quot;, who would each recruit settlers for their particular colony. In addition, for every 100 families an &quot;empresario&quot; settled in Texas, they would receive 23,000 acres of land to cultivate and settle on. During the state government&#x27;s deliberations, many would-be &quot;empresarios&quot; congregated in Mexico to lobby for land grants. Among them was Haden Edwards, an American land speculator known for his quick temper and aggressiveness. Despite his abrasiveness, Edwards was granted a colonization contract on April 14 allowing him to settle 800 families in East Texas. The contract contained standard language requiring Edwards to recognize all pre-existing Spanish and Mexican land titles in his grant area, to raise a militia to protect the settlers in the area and to allow the state land commissioner to certify all deeds awarded.

Edwards&#x27;s colony encompassed the land from the Navasota River to 20 leagues west of the Sabine River, and from 20 leagues north of the Gulf of Mexico to 15 leagues north of the town of Nacogdoches. To the west and north of the colony were lands controlled by several Native tribes that had recently been driven out of the United States. The southern boundary was a colony overseen by Stephen F. Austin, the son of the first &quot;empresario&quot; in Texas. East of Edwards&#x27;s grant was the former Sabine Free State, a neutral zone, which had been essentially lawless for several decades. The boundaries of the new colony and the municipality of Nacogdoches partially overlapped, leading to uncertainty over who had jurisdiction over which function. The majority of the established settlers lived outside the eastern boundary of the Edwards colony.

==Prelude==
Edwards arrived in Nacogdoches in August 1825. Mistakenly believing that he had the authority to determine the validity of existing land claims, Edwards demanded written proof of ownership in September or the land would be forfeited and sold at auction. His action was at least partially driven by prejudice; Edwards scorned those who were poorer or of a different race. By removing less-prosperous settlers, he could assign their lands to wealthy planters, like himself, from the Southern United States.

Very few of the English-speaking residents had valid titles. Those who had not arrived as filibusters had been duped by fraudulent land speculators. Most of the Spanish-speaking landowners had lived on grants made to their families 70 or more years previously and were unable to produce any paperwork. Anticipating the potential conflict between the new &quot;empresario&quot; and the long-time residents of the area, the acting &quot;alcalde&quot; of the municipality, Luis Procela, and the municipality clerk, Jose Antonio Sepulveda, began validating old Spanish and Mexican land titles, a function legally assigned to the state land commissioner. In response, Edwards accused the men of forging deeds, further angering the residents.

By December 1825, Edwards had recruited 50 families to emigrate from the United States. As required under his contract, Edwards organized a Texian Militia company open to his colonists and established residents. When militia members elected Sepulveda as their captain, Edwards nullified the results and proclaimed himself head of the militia company. After that debacle, Edwards, acting outside his authority, called for elections for a new &quot;alcalde&quot;. Two men were nominated for the position—Edwards&#x27;s son-in-law, Chichester Chaplin, seen as the representative for the newly-arrived immigrants, and Samuel Norris, an American who had married the daughter of a long-time resident and was sympathetic to the more-established landowners. After Chaplin&#x27;s victory, many settlers alleged vote-stacking in an appeal to Juan Antonio Saucedo, the political chief of the Department of Béxar. In March, Saucedo overturned the election results and proclaimed Norris the winner. Edwards refused to recognize Norris&#x27;s authority.

Shortly after Saucedo&#x27;s ruling, Edwards left to recruit more settlers from the United States, leaving his younger brother, Benjamin, in charge of the colony. Benjamin could not maintain stability in the colony, and the situation deteriorated rapidly. A vigilante group of earlier settlers harassed many newcomers, and Benjamin made several complaints to state authorities. Unhappy with his tone and the increasing tension, Mexican authorities revoked the land grant in October and instructed the Edwards brothers to leave Mexico. Rumors that Haden Edwards had returned to the United States to raise an army and not just to recruit settlers likely influenced the government&#x27;s action. Unwilling to abandon his $50,000 (about $ as of 2025) investment in the colony, Haden Edwards rejoined his brother in Nacogdoches in late October, continuing their business affairs despite the cancellation of his colonization contract.

==Conflict==

In October, Norris ruled that Edwards had improperly taken land from an existing settler to give to a new immigrant. Norris evicted the immigrant, angering many of the colonists. Later that month, another new immigrant was arrested and ordered to leave the country after refusing to purchase a merchant license before trading with the Indian tribes. On November 22, 1826, local Texian Militia colonel Martin Parmer and 39 other Edwards colonists entered Nacogdoches and arrested Norris, Sepulveda, and the commander of the small Mexican garrison, charging them with oppression and corruption. Haden Edwards was also arrested for violating his expulsion order but was immediately paroled, possibly as a ploy to disguise his own involvement in the plot. A kangaroo court found the other men guilty, removed them from their positions, and banned them from ever holding another public office. The court disbanded after appointing a temporary &quot;alcalde&quot;. The actions benefitted Parmer personally; several weeks earlier, after Parmer killed a man in a dispute, Norris had issued a warrant for Parmer&#x27;s arrest. With Norris removed from office, the arrest warrant was voided.

Throughout the fall, Benjamin Edwards had tried to gather support from the Edwards colonists for a potential armed revolt against Mexican authority. Largely unsuccessful, he approached the nearby Cherokee tribe for assistance. Several years earlier, the tribe had applied for title to the lands they occupied in northern East Texas. They were promised but never given a deed from the Mexican authorities. Benjamin Edwards offered the tribe clear title to all of Texas north of Nacogdoches in exchange for armed support for his plans.

On December 16, the Edwards brothers invaded Nacogdoches with only 30 settlers, seizing one building in town, the Old Stone Fort. On December 21, they declared the former Edwards colony to be a new republic, named Fredonia. Within hours of the announcement, the Fredonians signed a peace treaty with the Cherokee, represented by Chief Richard Fields and John Dunn Hunter. Fields and Hunter claimed to represent an additional 23 other tribes and promised to provide 400 warriors. In recognition of the agreement, above the Old Stone Fort flew a new flag containing two stripes (one red, one white) representing the two races. Inscribed on the banner was the motto, &quot;Independence, Liberty, and Justice.&quot; Haden Edwards also sent messengers to Louisiana to request aid from the United States military, which refused to intervene. Another emissary sent to invite Stephen F. Austin and his colonists to join the rebellion garnered the rebuke: &quot;You are deluding yourselves and this delusion will ruin you.&quot;

Edwards&#x27;s actions disturbed many of his colonists because of their loyalty to their adopted country or their fear of his alliance with the Cherokee. Mexican authorities were also concerned with the Cherokee alliance, and both Peter Ellis Bean, the Mexican Indian agent, and Saucedo, the political chief, began negotiations with Fields. They explained to the Cherokee that the tribe had not followed proper procedures to attain a land grant and promised that if they reapplied through official channels, the Mexican government would honor their land request. Such arguments and a planned Mexican military response convinced many Cherokee to repudiate their treaty with Edwards.

On news of the November arrest of the &quot;alcalde&quot;, the Mexican government began preparing to retaliate. On December 11, Lieutenant Colonel Mateo Ahumada, the military commander in Texas, marched from San Antonio de Béxar with 110 members of the infantry and initially stopped in Austin&#x27;s colony to assess the loyalty of his settlers. On January 1, Austin announced to his colonists that &quot;infatuated madmen at Nacogdoches have declared independence.&quot; Much of his colony immediately volunteered to assist in quelling the rebellion. When the Mexican army left for Nacogdoches on January 22, they were joined by 250 Texian Militia from Austin&#x27;s colony.

Impatient with the army&#x27;s response time, Norris led 80 men to retake the Old Stone Fort. Although Parmer had fewer than 20 supporters with him, his men routed Norris&#x27;s force in less than ten minutes. On January 31, Bean, accompanied by 70 Texian Militia from Austin&#x27;s colony, rode into Nacogdoches. By now, Parmer and Edwards had learned that the Cherokee had abandoned any intention of waging war against Mexico. When not a single Cherokee warrior had appeared to reinforce the revolt, Edwards and his supporters fled. Bean pursued them to the Sabine River, but most, including both Edwards brothers, safely crossed into the United States. Ahumada and his soldiers, accompanied by political chief Saucedo, entered Nacogdoches on February 8 to restore order.

Although the Cherokee had not raised arms against Mexico, their treaty with the Fredonian revolutionaries caused Mexican authorities to question the tribe&#x27;s loyalty. To demonstrate loyalty to Mexico, the Cherokee council ordered both Fields and Hunter to be executed. Under tribal law, certain offenses such as aiding an enemy of the tribe were punishable by death. By sentencing Fields and Hunter to death for that reason, the Cherokee affirmed that Edwards and his cohorts were their enemies. Both men fled but were soon captured and executed. When the executions were reported to Mexican authorities on February 28, the commandant general of the Eastern Interior Provinces, Anastasio Bustamante, praised the Cherokee for their prompt action.

Bustamante ultimately offered a general amnesty for all who participated in the conflict except for Haden and Benjamin Edwards, Parmer, and Adolphus Sterne, a local merchant who had provided supplies to the rebel force. Like the Edwards brothers, Parmer escaped into Louisiana. Sterne remained and was sentenced to death for treason but was paroled if he swore allegiance to Mexico and never again took up arms against the Mexican government.

==Aftermath==
The rebellion changed the dynamic between settlers and local tribes. Although the Cherokee repudiated the rebellion, their initial support caused many settlers to distrust the tribe. The rebellion and subsequent Mexican army response also changed the settlers&#x27; relationships with other tribes. In preceding years, the Tawakoni and Waco tribes, allied with various Comanche bands, had regularly raided Texas settlements. Fearing that the tribes, like the Cherokee, could ally with other groups against Mexican control, Bustamante began preparations to attack and weaken all hostile tribes in East Texas. On learning of the imminent invasion, in April 1827 the Towakoni and Waco sued for peace. In June, the two tribes signed a peace treaty with Mexico, promising to halt all raids against Mexican settlers. The Towakoni then assisted their allies, the Penateka Comanche, in reaching a treaty with Mexico. When Bustamante&#x27;s troops left Texas later that year, the Towakoni and Waco resumed their raiding. The Comanche tribe upheld their treaty for many years and often assisted Mexican soldiers in recovering livestock stolen by the other tribes.

The failed rebellion also affected Mexican relations with the United States. Even before the revolt, many Mexican officials had worried that the United States was plotting to gain control of Texas. Once the rebellion came to light, officials suspected that Edwards had been an agent of the United States. To help protect the region, a new, larger garrison was established in Nacogdoches, to be commanded by Colonel Jose de las Piedras. As a direct result of Edwards&#x27;s actions, the Mexican government authorized an extensive expedition, conducted by General Manuel de Mier y Terán, to inspect the Texas settlements and to recommend a future course of action. Mier y Teran&#x27;s reports led to the Law of April 6, 1830, which severely restricted immigration into Texas and stopped the import of slaves. Under the law, Mexicans who agreed to relocate to Texas would get good land, free transportation to Texas, and some financial assistance. Convicts would be sent to Texas to build fortifications and roads to stimulate trade. Within Texas the laws were widely denounced both by recent immigrants and by native-born Mexicans and led to further armed conflict between Mexican soldiers and Texas residents.

Some historians regard the Fredonian Rebellion as the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Historian W.B. Bates remarked that the revolt was &quot;premature, but it sparked the powder for later success&quot;. The people of Nacogdoches played instrumental roles in other rebellions in Texas over the next few years; in 1832, they expelled Piedras and his troops from Nacogdoches, and many Nacogdoches residents participated in the Texas Revolution.

==Popular culture== 
* The imaginary country of Freedonia, bordered by Sylvania, features in the Marx Brothers&#x27; 1933 movie &quot;Duck Soup&quot;. Since then, the name Freedonia has been used many times (see Freedonia). 
* In the 2018 e-book &quot;Hail! Hail!&quot; by Harry Turtledove, the Marx Brothers are sent back in time by a lightning storm from 1934 to 1826 and interfere with the rebellion.
* Fredonia is mentioned in the 1985 Cormac McCarthy novel Blood Meridian.

<doc id="463574" wikidata="Q713418" url="?curid=463574" title="TSMC">
<text>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC or Taiwan Semiconductor) is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company. It is the world&#x27;s most valuable semiconductor company, the world&#x27;s largest dedicated independent (&quot;pure-play&quot;) semiconductor foundry, and Taiwan&#x27;s largest company, with headquarters and main operations located in the Hsinchu Science Park in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Although the central government of Taiwan is the largest individual shareholder, the majority of TSMC is owned by foreign investors. In 2023, the company was ranked 44th in the Forbes Global 2000. Taiwan&#x27;s exports of integrated circuits amounted to $184 billion in 2022, accounted for nearly 25 percent of Taiwan&#x27;s GDP. TSMC constitutes about 30 percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange&#x27;s main index.

TSMC was founded in Taiwan in 1987 by Morris Chang as the world&#x27;s first dedicated semiconductor foundry. It has long been the leading company in its field. When Chang retired in 2018, after 31 years of TSMC leadership, Mark Liu became chairman and C. C. Wei became Chief Executive. It has been listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange since 1993; in 1997 it became the first Taiwanese company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Since 1994, TSMC has had a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.4 percent in revenue and a CAGR of 16.1 percent in earnings.

Most fabless semiconductor companies such as AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia are customers of TSMC, as are emerging companies such as Allwinner Technology, HiSilicon, Spectra7, and UNISOC. Programmable logic device companies Xilinx and previously Altera also make or made use of TSMC&#x27;s foundry services. Some integrated device manufacturers that have their own fabrication facilities, such as Intel, NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments, outsource some of their production to TSMC. At least one semiconductor company, LSI, re-sells TSMC wafers through its ASIC design services and design IP portfolio.

TSMC has a global capacity of about thirteen million 300 mm-equivalent wafers per year as of 2020 and produces chips for customers with process nodes from 2 microns to 3 nanometres. TSMC was the first foundry to market 7-nanometre and 5-nanometre (used by the 2020 Apple A14 and M1 SoCs, the MediaTek Dimensity 8100, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series processors) production capabilities, and the first to commercialize ASML&#x27;s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in high volume.

== History ==
In 1986, Li Kwoh-ting, representing the Executive Yuan, invited Morris Chang to serve as the president of the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and offered him a blank check to build Taiwan&#x27;s chip industry. At that time, the Taiwanese government wanted to develop its semiconductor industry, but its high investment and high risk nature made it difficult to find investors. Texas Instruments and Intel turned down Chang. Only Philips was willing to sign a joint venture contract with Taiwan to put up $58 million, transfer its production technology, and license intellectual property in exchange for a 27.5 percent stake in TSMC. Alongside generous tax benefits, the Taiwanese government, through the National Development Fund, Executive Yuan, provided another 48 percent of the startup capital for TSMC, and the rest of the capital was raised from several of the island&#x27;s wealthiest families, who owned firms that specialized in plastics, textiles, and chemicals. These wealthy Taiwanese were directly &quot;asked&quot; by the government to invest. From day one, TSMC was not really a private business: it was a project of the Taiwanese state. Its first CEO was James E. Dykes, who left after a year and Morris Chang became the CEO.

Since then, the company has continued to grow, albeit subject to the cycles of demand. In 2011, the company planned to increase research and development expenditures by almost 39 percent to NT$50 billion to fend off growing competition. The company also planned to expand capacity by 30 percent in 2011 to meet strong market demand. In May 2014, TSMC&#x27;s board of directors approved capital appropriations of US$568 million to increase and improve manufacturing capabilities after the company forecast higher than expected demand. In August 2014, TSMC&#x27;s board of directors approved additional capital appropriations of US$3.05 billion.

In 2011, it was reported that TSMC had begun trial production of the A5 SoC and A6 SoCs for Apple&#x27;s iPad and iPhone devices. According to reports, in May 2014 Apple sourced its A8 and A8X SoCs from TSMC. Apple then sourced the A9 SoC with both TSMC and Samsung (to increase volume for iPhone 6S launch) and the A9X exclusively with TSMC, thus resolving the issue of sourcing a chip in two different microarchitecture sizes. As of 2014, Apple was TSMC&#x27;s most important customer. In October 2014, ARM and TSMC announced a new multi-year agreement for the development of ARM based 10 nm FinFET processors.

Over the objection of the Tsai Ing-wen administration, in March 2017, TSMC invested US$3 billion in Nanjing to develop a manufacturing subsidiary there.

In 2020, TSMC became the first semiconductor company in the world to sign up for the RE100 initiative, pledging to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2050. TSMC accounts for roughly 5 percent of the energy consumption in Taiwan, even exceeding that of the capital city Taipei. This initiative was thus expected to accelerate the transformation to renewable energy in the country. For 2020, TSMC had a net income of US$17.60 billion on a consolidated revenue of US$45.51 billion, an increase of 57.5 percent and 31.4 percent respectively from the 2019 level of US$11.18 billion net income and US$34.63 billion consolidated revenue. Its market capitalization was over $550 billion in April 2021. TSMC&#x27;s revenue in the first quarter of 2020 reached US$10 billion, while its market capitalization was US$254 billion. TSMC&#x27;s market capitalization reached a value of NT$1.9 trillion (US$63.4 billion) in December 2010. It was ranked 70th in the FT Global 500 2013 list of the world&#x27;s most highly valued companies with a capitalization of US$86.7 billion, while reaching US$110 billion in May 2014. In March 2017, TSMC&#x27;s market capitalization surpassed that of semiconductor giant Intel for the first time, hitting NT$5.14 trillion (US$168.4 billion), with Intel&#x27;s at US$165.7 billion. On 27 June 2020, TSMC briefly became the world&#x27;s 10th most valuable company, with a market capitalization of US$410 billion.

To mitigate business risks in the event of war between Taiwan and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, since the beginning of the 2020s, TSMC has expanded its geographic operations, opening new fabs in Japan and the United States, with further plans for expansion into Germany. In July 2020, TSMC confirmed it would halt the shipment of silicon wafers to Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer Huawei and its subsidiary HiSilicon by 14 September. In November 2020, officials in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States approved TSMC&#x27;s plan to build a $12 billion chip plant in the city. The decision to locate a plant in the US came after the Trump administration warned about the issues concerning the world&#x27;s electronics made outside of the U.S. In 2021, news reports claimed that the facility might be tripled to roughly a $35 billion investment with six factories. See for more details.

In June 2021, following nearly a year of public controversy surrounding its COVID-19 vaccine shortage, with only about 10 percent of its 23.5 million population vaccinated; Taiwan agreed to allow TSMC and Foxconn to jointly negotiate purchasing COVID-19 vaccines on its behalf. In July 2021, BioNTech&#x27;s Chinese sales agent Fosun Pharma announced that the two technology manufacturers had reached an agreement to purchase 10 million BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines from Germany. TSMC and Foxconn pledged to each buy five million doses for up to $175 million, for donation to Taiwan&#x27;s vaccination program.

Due to the 2020–2023 global semiconductor shortage, Taiwanese competitor United Microelectronics raised prices approximately 7–9 percent, and prices for TSMC&#x27;s more mature processors were raised by about 20 percent. In November 2021, TSMC and Sony announced that TSMC would be establishing a new subsidiary named Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) in Kumamoto, Japan. The subsidiary manufactures 22- and 28-nanometer processes. The initial investment was approximately $7 billion, with Sony investing approximately $500 million for a less than 20 percent stake. Construction of the fabrication plant started in 2022, with production beginning two years later in 2024.

In February 2022, TSMC, Sony Semiconductor Solutions, and Denso announced that Denso would take a more than 10 percent equity stake in JASM with a US$0.35 billion investment, amid a scarcity of chips for automobiles. TSMC will also enhance JASM&#x27;s capabilities with 12/16 nanometer FinFET process technology in addition to the previously announced 22/28 nanometer process and increase monthly production capacity from 45,000 to 55,000 12-inch wafers. The total capital expenditure for JASM&#x27;s Kumamoto fab is estimated to be approximately US$8.6 billion. The Japanese government wants JASM to supply essential chips to Japan&#x27;s electronic device makers and auto companies as trade friction between the United States and China threatens to disrupt supply chains. The fab is expected to directly create about 1,700 high-tech professional jobs.

In July 2022, TSMC announced the company had posted a record profit in the second quarter, with net income up 76.4 percent year-over-year. The company saw steady growth in the automotive and data center sectors with some weakness in the consumer market. Some of the capital expenditures are projected to be pushed up to 2023. In the third quarter of 2022, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed purchase of 60 million shares in TSMC, acquiring a $4.1 billion stake, making it one of its largest holdings in a technology company. However, Berkshire sold off 86.2 percent of its stake by the next quarter citing geopolitical tensions as a factor. In February 2024, TSMC shares hit a record high, with the high on the trading day reaching NT$709 and closing at NT$697 (+8%). This was influenced by the increase in the price target on chip designer Nvidia. TSMC currently manufactures 3-nanometer chips and plans to start 2-nanometer mass production in 2025. It is included in the FTSE4Good Index, being the only Asian company in the top ten.

In October 2024, TSMC informed the United States Department of Commerce about a potential breach of export controls in which one of its most advanced chips was sent to Huawei via another company with ties to the Chinese government.

=== Patent dispute with GlobalFoundries ===
On 26 August 2019, GlobalFoundries filed several patent infringement lawsuits against TSMC in the US and Germany claiming that TSMC&#x27;s 7 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm, 16 nm, and 28 nm nodes infringed 16 of their patents. GlobalFoundries named twenty defendants. TSMC said that they were confident that the allegations were baseless. On 1 October 2019, TSMC filed patent infringement lawsuits against GlobalFoundries in the US, Germany and Singapore, claiming that GlobalFoundries&#x27; 12 nm, 14 nm, 22 nm, 28 nm and 40 nm nodes infringed 25 of their patents. On 29 October 2019, TSMC and GlobalFoundries announced a resolution to the dispute, agreeing to a life-of-patents cross-license for all of their existing semiconductor patents and new patents for the next 10 years.

=== Business trends ===
The key trends for TSMC are (as of the financial year ending December 31):

TSMC and the rest of the foundry industry are exposed to the cyclical industrial dynamics of the semiconductor industry. TSMC must ensure its production capacity to meet strong customer demand during upturns; however, during downturns, it must contend with excess capacity because of weak demand and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities. As a result, the company&#x27;s financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years. This is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth. TSMC&#x27;s business has generally also been seasonal, with a peak in Q3 and a low in Q1.

In 2014, TSMC was at the forefront of the foundry industry for high-performance, low-power applications, leading major smartphone chip companies, such as Qualcomm, Mediatek, and Apple, to place an increasing amount of orders. While the competitors in the foundry industry (primarily GlobalFoundries and United Microelectronics Corporation) have encountered difficulties ramping leading-edge 28 nm capacity, the leading Integrated Device Manufacturers such as Samsung and Intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for advanced mobile applications.

For most of 2014, TSMC saw a continuing increase in revenues due to increased demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted &#x27;unseasonably strong&#x27; first-quarter results. For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nm technology business growing more than 30 percent from the previous quarter. Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules, and in August 2014 it was reported that TSMC&#x27;s production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.

However, monthly sales for 2014 peaked in October, decreasing by 10 percent in November due to cautious inventory adjustment actions taken by some of its customers. TSMC&#x27;s revenue for 2014 saw growth of 28 percent over the previous year, while TSMC forecasted that revenue for 2015 would grow by 15 to 20 percent from 2014, thanks to strong demand for its 20 nm process, new 16 nm FinFET process technology as well as continuing demand for 28 nm, and demand for less advanced chip fabrication in its 200mm fabs.

In 2019, TSMC was ranked fourth in the MEMS field, behind leader Silex Microsystems. In 2021, TSMC was ranked third in the MEMS field.

== Technologies ==

TSMC&#x27;s N7+ is the first commercially available extreme-ultraviolet lithographic process in the semiconductor industry. It uses ultraviolet patterning and enables more acute circuits to be implemented on the silicon. N7+ offers a 15–20 percent higher transistor density and 10 percent reduction in power consumption than previous technology. The N7 achieved the fastest ever volume time to market, faster than 10 nm and 16 nm. The N5 iteration doubles transistor density and improves performance by an additional 15 percent.

== Production capabilities ==

It also offers &quot;design for manufacturing&quot; (DFM) customer services. In press publications, these processes will often be referenced, for example, for the mobile variant, simply by 7&quot;nmFinFET&quot; or even more briefly by 7FF. At the beginning of 2019, TSMC was advertising N7+, N7, and N6 as its leading edge technologies. As of June 2020, TSMC is the manufacturer selected for production of Apple&#x27;s 5 nanometer ARM processors, as &quot;the company plans to eventually transition the entire Mac lineup to its Arm-based processors, including the priciest desktop computers&quot;. In July 2020, TSMC signed a 20-year deal with Ørsted to buy the entire production of two offshore wind farms under development off Taiwan&#x27;s west coast. At the time of its signing, it was the world&#x27;s largest corporate green energy order ever made. In July 2021, both Apple and Intel were reported to be testing their proprietary chip designs with TSMC&#x27;s 3 nm production.

== Facilities ==

=== Central Taiwan Science Park ===
The investment of US$9.4 billion to build its third 300mm wafer fabrication facility in Central Taiwan Science Park (Fab 15) was originally announced in 2010. The facility was expected to manufacture over 100,000 wafers a month and generate US$5 billion per year of revenue. TSMC has continued to expand advanced 28 nm manufacturing capacity at Fab 15. On 12 January 2011, TSMC announced the acquisition of land from Powerchip Semiconductor for NT$2.9 billion (US$96 million) to build two additional 300mm fabs (Fab 12B) to cope with increasing global demand.

=== Arizona ===

In 2020, TSMC announced a planned fab in Phoenix, Arizona, intended to begin production by 2024 at a rate of 20,000 wafers per month. As of 2020, TSMC announced that it would bring its newest 5 nm process to the Arizona facility, a significant break from its prior practice of limiting US fabs to older technologies. The Arizona plant was estimated to not be fully operational until 2024, when the 5 nm process is projected to be replaced by TSMC&#x27;s 3 nm process as the latest technology. At launch it will be the most advanced fab in the United States. TSMC plans to spend $12 billion on the project over eight years, beginning in 2021. TSMC claimed the plant will create 1,900 full-time jobs.

In December 2022, TSMC announced its plans to triple its investment in the Arizona plants in response to the growing tensions between the US and China and the supply chain disruption that has led to chip shortages. In that same month, TSMC stated that they were running into major cost issues, because the cost of construction of buildings and facilities in the US is four to five times what an identical plant would cost in Taiwan, (due to higher costs of labor, red tape, and training), as well as difficulty finding qualified personnel (for which it has hired US workers and sent them for training in Taiwan for 12–18 months.) These additional production costs will increase the cost of TSMC&#x27;s chips made in the US to at least 50 percent more than the cost of chips made in Taiwan. In July 2023 TSMC warned that US talent was insufficient, so Taiwanese workers will need to be brought in for a limited time, and that the chip factory will not be operational until 2025. In September 2023, an analyst said the chips will still need to be sent back to Taiwan for packaging. In January 2024, TSMC chairman Liu again warned that Arizona lacked workers with the specialized skills to hire and that TSMC&#x27;s second Arizona plant likely will not start volume production of advanced chips until 2027 or 2028.

In April 2024, the US Commerce Department agreed to provide $6.6 billion in direct funding and up to $5 billion in loans to TSMC for the purposes of creating semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Arizona. This action falls under the CHIPS and Science Act and is intended to boost domestic chip production for the US.

====Halo Vista====

In October 2024 it was revealed that development around the TSMC plants would be called Halo Vista, that will develop 3,500 acres of property from restaurants, hotels, housing, and other Mixed-use development. There will also be a Sonoran Oasis Research and Technology Park that will also help set up the supply chain and foster innovative development, much like how Hsinchu Science Park is to TSMC in Taiwan. As many as 6 fabrication plants could be built there worth a total of around $120 billion.

=== Washington ===
TSMC Washington is a subsidiary of TSMC based in Camas, Washington, outside Portland, Oregon. The campus contains a complex consisting of a 200mm wafer fabrication plant. TSMC Washington (originally known as WaferTech) was established in June 1996 as a joint venture between TSMC, Altera, Analog Devices, and ISSI. The companies along with minor individual investors placed US$1.2 billion into this venture, which was at the time the single largest startup investment in the state of Washington. The facility started production in July 1998 with its first product being a 0.35 micrometer part for Altera. TSMC bought out the stake of the other partners in 2000, turning the company into a fully-owned subsidiary of TSMC. As of 2024, the facility employs 1100 workers and supports node sizes of 0.35, 0.30, 0.25, 0.22, 0.18, and 0.16 micrometers, with an emphasis on embedded flash process technology.

=== Japan ===

In November 2021, TSMC and Sony announced that TSMC would be establishing a new subsidiary named Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing (JASM) in Kumamoto, Japan. Denso and Toyota have also invested in the company and are minor shareholders. 

The first factory (Fab 23) in Kikuyo, Kumamoto, began commercial operations in December 2024 and produces 12-, 22-, and 28-nanometer processes. Fab 23 cost US$8.6 billion to build, with 476 billion yen subsidised by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI).

The second factory, currently under construction adjacent to Fab 23 as of January 2025, will produce 6-nanometer and 12-nanometer processes. This factory is estimated to cost US$13.9 billion, with 732 billion yen funded by the METI.

=== Germany ===
In August 2023, TSMC committed €3.5 billion to a €10+ billion factory in Dresden, Germany. The plant is subsidised with €5 billion from the German government. Three European companies (Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies, and NXP Semiconductors) invested in the plant in return for a 10 percent share each. The resulting joint venture with TSMC is named European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC). The factory is planned to be fully operational in 2029 with a monthly capacity of 40,000 12-inch wafers.

<text>Artists&#x27; books (or book arts or book objects) are works of art that take the form of a book. They are often published in small editions, though they are sometimes produced as one-of-a-kind objects.

==Overview==
Artists&#x27; books have employed a wide range of forms, including the traditional Codex form as well as less common forms like scrolls, fold-outs, concertinas or loose items contained in a box. Artists have been active in printing and book production for centuries, but the artist&#x27;s book is primarily a late 20th-century form. Book forms were also created within earlier movements, such as Dada, Constructivism, Futurism, and Fluxus.

Artists&#x27; books are made for a variety of reasons. An artist book is generally interactive, portable, movable and easily shared. Some artists books challenge the conventional book format and become sculptural objects. Artists&#x27; books may be created in order to make art accessible to people outside of the formal contexts of galleries or museums. Artists&#x27; books can be made from a variety of materials, including found objects. The Mexican artist Ulises Carrión understood artists&#x27; books as autonomous forms that are not reduced only to text, as in a traditional book.

==Early history==
===Origins of the form: William Blake===
Whilst artists have been involved in the production of books in Europe since the early medieval period (such as the &quot;Book of Kells&quot; and the ), most writers on the subject cite the English visionary artist and poet William Blake (1757–1827) as the earliest direct antecedent.

Books such as &quot;Songs of Innocence and of Experience&quot; were written, illustrated, printed, coloured and bound by Blake and his wife Catherine, and the merging of handwritten texts and images created intensely vivid, hermetic works without any obvious precedents. These works would set the tone for later artists&#x27; books, connecting self-publishing and self-distribution with the integration of text, image and form. All of these factors have remained key concepts in artists&#x27; books up to the present day.

==Avant-garde production 1909–1937==
As Europe plunged headlong towards World War I, various groups of avant-garde artists across the continent started to focus on pamphlets, posters, manifestos and books. This was partially as a way to gain publicity within an increasing print-dominated world, but also as a strategy to bypass traditional gallery systems, disseminate ideas and to create affordable work that might (theoretically) be seen by people who would not otherwise enter art galleries.

This move toward radicalism was exemplified by the Italian Futurists, and by Filippo Marinetti (1876–1944) in particular. The publication of the &quot;Futurist Manifesto&quot;, 1909, on the front cover of the French daily newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot; was an audacious that resulted in international notoriety. Marinetti used the ensuing fame to tour Europe, kickstarting movements across the continent that all veered towards book-making and pamphleteering.

In London, for instance, Marinetti&#x27;s visit directly precipitated Wyndham Lewis&#x27; founding of the Vorticist movement, whose literary magazine &quot;BLAST&quot; is an early example of a modernist periodical, while David Bomberg&#x27;s book &quot;Russian Ballet&quot; (1919), with its interspersing of a single carefully spaced text interspersed with abstract colour lithographs, is a landmark in the history of English language artists&#x27; books. With regards to the creation of Artists&#x27; books, the most influential offshoot of futurist principles, however, occurred in Russia. Marinetti visited in 1914, proselytizing on behalf of Futurist principles of speed, danger, and cacophony.

===Russian Futurism, 1910–1917===
Centered in Moscow, around the Gileia Group of &quot;Transrational&quot; (&quot;zaum&quot;) poets David and Nikolai Burliuk, Elena Guro, Vasili Kamenski and Velimir Khlebnikov, the Russian futurists created a sustained series of artists&#x27; books that challenged every assumption of orthodox book production. Whilst some of the books created by this group would be relatively straightforward typeset editions of poetry, many others played with form, structure, materials, and content that still seems contemporary.

Key works such as &quot;Worldbackwards&quot; (1912), by Khlebnikov and Kruchenykh, Natalia Goncharova, Larionov Rogovin and Tatlin, &quot;Transrational Boog&quot; (1915) by Aliagrov and Kruchenykh &amp; Olga Rozanova and &quot;Universal War&quot; (1916) by Kruchenykh used hand-written text, integrated with expressive lithographs and collage elements, creating small editions with dramatic differences between individual copies. Other titles experimented with materials such as wallpaper, printing methods including carbon copying and hectographs, and binding methods including the random sequencing of pages, ensuring no two books would have the same contextual meaning.

Russian futurism gradually evolved into Constructivism after the Russian Revolution, centered on the key figures of Malevich and Tatlin. Attempting to create a new proletarian art for a new communist epoch, constructivist books would also have a huge impact on other European avant-gardes, with design and text-based works such as El Lissitzky&#x27;s &quot;For The Voice&quot; (1922) having a direct impact on groups inspired by or directly linked to communism. Dada in Zurich and Berlin, the Bauhaus in Weimar, and De Stijl in the Netherlands all printed numerous books, periodicals, and theoretical tracts within the newly emerging International Modernist style. Artists&#x27; books from this era include Kurt Schwitters and Kate Steinitz&#x27;s book &quot;The Scarecrow&quot; (1925), and Theo van Doesburg&#x27;s periodical &quot;De Stijl&quot;.

===Dada and Surrealism===
Dada was initially started at the Cabaret Voltaire, by a group of exiled artists in neutral Switzerland during World War I. Originally influenced by the sound poetry of Wassily Kandinsky, and the Blaue Reiter Almanac that Kandinsky had edited with Marc, artists&#x27; books, periodicals, manifestoes and absurdist theatre were central to each of Dada&#x27;s main incarnations. Berlin Dada in particular, started by Richard Huelsenbeck after leaving Zurich in 1917, would publish a number of incendiary artists&#x27; books, such as George Grosz&#x27;s &quot;The Face Of The Dominant Class&quot; (1921), a series of politically motivated satirical lithographs about the German bourgeoisie.

Whilst concerned mainly with poetry and theory, Surrealism created a number of works that continued in the French tradition of the Livre d&#x27;Artiste, whilst simultaneously subverting it. Max Ernst&#x27;s Une Semaine de Bonté (1934), collaging found images from Victorian books, is a famous example, as is Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s cover for &quot;Le Surréalisme&quot;&#x27; (1947) featuring a tactile three-dimensional pink breast made of rubber.

One important Russian writer/artist who created artist books was Alexei Remizov. Drawing on medieval Russian literature, he creatively combined dreams, reality, and pure whimsy in his artist books.

==After World War II; post-modernism and pop art==

===Regrouping the avant-garde===
After World War II, many artists in Europe attempted to rebuild links beyond nationalist boundaries, and used the artist&#x27;s book as a way of experimenting with form, disseminating ideas and forging links with like-minded groups in other countries.

After the war, a number of leading artists and poets started to explore the functions and forms of the book &#x27;in a serious way&#x27; Concrete poets in Brazil such as Augusto and Haroldo de Campos, Cobra artists in the Netherlands and Denmark and the French Lettrists all began to systematically deconstruct the book. A fine example of the latter is Isidore Isou&#x27;s &quot;Le Grand Désordre&quot;, (1960), a work that challenges the viewer to reassemble the contents of an envelope back into a semblance of narrative. Two other examples of poet-artists whose work provided models for artists&#x27; books include Marcel Broodthaers and Ian Hamilton Finlay.

Yves Klein in France was similarly challenging Modernist integrity with a series of works such as (1954) and Dimanche (1960) which turned on issues of identity and duplicity. Other examples from this era include Guy Debord and Asger Jorn&#x27;s two collaborations, &quot;Fin de Copenhague&quot; (1957) and &quot;Mémoires&quot;&#x27; (1959), two works of Psychogeography created from found magazines of Copenhagen and Paris respectively, collaged and then printed over in unrelated colours.

===Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha===
Often credited with defining the modern artist&#x27;s book, Dieter Roth (1930–98) produced a series of works which systematically deconstructed the form of the book throughout the fifties and sixties. These disrupted the codex&#x27;s authority by creating books with holes in (e.g. &quot;Picture Book&quot;, 1957), allowing the viewer to see more than one page at the same time. Roth was also the first artist to re-use found books-comic books, printer&#x27;s end papers and newspapers (such as &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, 1961, and &quot;AC&quot;, 1964). Although originally produced in Iceland in extremely small editions, Roth&#x27;s books would be produced in increasingly large runs, through numerous publishers in Europe and North America, and would ultimately be reprinted together by the German publisher Hansjörg Mayer in the 1970s, making them more widely available in the last half-century than the work of any other comparable artist.

Almost contemporaneously in the United States, Ed Ruscha (1937–present) printed his first book, &quot;Twentysix Gasoline Stations&quot;, in 1963 in an edition of 400, but had printed almost 4000 copies by the end of the decade. The book is directly related to American photographic travelogues, such as Robert Frank&#x27;s &quot;The Americans&quot;&#x27; (1965), but deals with a banal journey on route 66 between Ruscha&#x27;s home in Los Angeles and his parents&#x27; in Oklahoma. Like Roth, Ruscha created a series of homogenous books throughout the sixties, including &quot;Every Building on the Sunset Strip&quot;, 1966, and &quot;Royal Road Test&quot;, 1967.

A Swiss artist worth mentioning is Warja Honegger-Lavater, who created artists&#x27; books contemporaneously with Dieter Roth and Ed Ruscha.

===Fluxus and the Multiple===
Growing out of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Experimental Composition&quot; classes from 1957 to 1959 at the New School for Social Research, Fluxus was a loose collective of artists from North America and Europe that centred on George Maciunas (1931–78), who was born in Lithuania. Maciunas set up the AG Gallery in New York, 1961, with the intention of putting on events and selling books and multiples by artists he liked. The gallery closed within a year, apparently having failed to sell a single item. The collective survived, and featured an ever-changing roster of like-minded artists including George Brecht, Joseph Beuys, Davi Det Hompson, Daniel Spoerri, Yoko Ono, Emmett Williams and Nam June Paik.

Artists&#x27; books (such as &quot;An Anthology of Chance Operations&quot;) and multiples (as well as happenings), were central to Fluxus&#x27; ethos disdaining galleries and institutions, replacing them with &quot;art in the community&quot;, and the definition of what was and wasn&#x27;t a book became increasingly elastic throughout the decade as the two forms collided. Many of the Fluxus editions share characteristics with both; George Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Water Yam&quot; (1963), for instance, involves a series of &quot;scores&quot; collected in a box, whilst similar scores are collected together in a bound book in Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;Grapefruit&quot; (1964). Another famous example is &quot;Literature Sausage&quot; by Dieter Roth, one of many artists to be affiliated to fluxus at one or other point in its history; each one was made from a pulped book mixed with onions and spices and stuffed into sausage skin. Literally a book, but utterly unreadable. Litsa Spathi and Ruud Jansen of the Fluxus Heidelberg Center in the Netherlands have an online archive of fluxus publications and fluxus webslinks.

===Conceptual art===
The artist&#x27;s book proved central to the development of conceptual art. Lawrence Weiner, Bruce Nauman and Sol LeWitt in North America, Art &amp; Language in the United Kingdom, Maurizio Nannucci in Italy, Jochen Gerz and Jean Le Gac in France and Jaroslaw Kozlowski in Poland all used the artist&#x27;s book as a central part of their art practice. An early example, the exhibition &quot;January 5–31, 1969&quot; organised in rented office space in New York City by Seth Siegelaub, featured nothing except a stack of artists&#x27; books, also called &quot;January 5–31, 1969&quot; and featuring predominantly text-based work by Lawrence Weiner, Douglas Huebler, Joseph Kosuth, and Robert Barry. Sol LeWitt&#x27;s &quot;Brick Wall&quot;, (1977), for instance, simply chronicled shadows as they passed across a brick wall, Maurizio Nannucci &quot;M/40&quot; with 92 typesetting pages (1967) and &quot;Definizioni/Definitions&quot; (1970), whilst Kozlowski&#x27;s &quot;Reality&quot; (1972) took a section of Kant&#x27;s Critique of Pure Reason, removing all of the text, leaving only the punctuation behind. Another example is the &quot;Einbetoniertes Buch&quot;, 1971 (book in concrete) by Wolf Vostell.

Louise Odes Neaderland, the founder and Director of the non-profit group International Society of Copier Artists (I.S.C.A.) helped to establish electrostatic art as a legitimate art form, and to offer a means of distribution and exhibition to Xerox book Artists. Volume 1, #1 of The I.S.C.A. Quarterly was issued in April 1982 in a folio of 50 eight by eleven inch unbound prints in black and white or color Xerography. Each contributing artist&#x27;s work of Xerox art was numbered in the Table of Contents and the corresponding number was stamped on the back of each artist&#x27;s work. &quot;The format changed over the years and eventually included an Annual Bookworks Edition, which contained a box of small handmade books from the I.S.C.A. contributors.&quot;
After the advent of home computers and printers made it easier for artists to do what the copy machine formerly did, Volume 21, #4 in June 2003 was the final issue. &quot;The 21 years of The I.S.C.A. Quarterlies represented a visual record of artists’ responses to timely social and political issues,&quot; as well as to personal experiences. The complete I.S.C.A quarterly collection is housed and catalogued at the Jaffe Center for Book Arts at the Florida Atlantic University library.

===Proliferation and reintegration into the mainstream===
As the form has expanded, many of the original distinctive elements of artists&#x27; books have been lost, blurred or transgressed. Artists such as Cy Twombly, Anselm Kiefer and PINK de Thierry, with her series Encyclopaedia Arcadia, routinely make unique, hand crafted books in a deliberate reaction to the small mass-produced editions of previous generations; Albert Oehlen, for instance, whilst still keeping artists&#x27; books central to his practice, has created a series of works that have more in common with Victorian sketchbooks. A return to the cheap mass-produced aesthetic has been evidenced since the early 90s, with artists such as Mark Pawson and Karen Reimer making cheap mass production central to their practice.

Contemporary and post-conceptual artists also have made artist&#x27;s books an important aspect of their practice, notably William Wegman, Bob Cobbing, Martin Kippenberger, Raymond Pettibon, Freddy Flores Knistoff and Suze Rotolo. Book artists in pop-up books and other three-dimensional one-of-a-kind books include Bruce Schnabel, Carol Barton, Hedi Kyle, Julie Chen, Ed Hutchins and Susan Joy Share.

Many book artists working in traditional, as well as non-traditional, forms have taught and shared their art in workshops at centers such as the Center for Book Arts in New York City, and the Visual Arts Studio (VisArts), the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Studio School, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Statewide Outreach Program, and the no longer extant Richmond Printmaking Workshop, all in Richmond, Virginia. Other institutions devoted to the art form include San Francisco Center for the Book, Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, New York, and Women&#x27;s Studio Workshop in Rosendale, New York.

==Art book fairs==
The recent boom in artists&#x27; books production and dissemination is closely linked to art book fairs: 
==Critical reception==
In the early 1970s the artist&#x27;s book began to be recognized as a distinct genre, and with this recognition came the beginnings of critical appreciation of and debate on the subject. Institutions devoted to the study and teaching of the form were founded (The Center for Book Arts in New York, for example); library and art museum collections began to create new rubrics with which to classify and catalog artists&#x27; books and also actively began to expand their fledgling collections; new collections were founded (such as Franklin Furnace in New York); and numerous group exhibitions of artist&#x27;s books were organized in Europe and America (notably one at Moore College of Art and Design in Philadelphia in 1973, the catalog of which, according to Stefan Klima&#x27;s &quot;Artists Books: A Critical Survey of the Literature&quot;, is the first place the term &quot;Artist&#x27;s Book&quot; was used). Artists&#x27; books became a popular form for feminist artists beginning in the 1970s. The Women&#x27;s Studio Workshop (NY) and the Women&#x27;s Graphic Center at the Woman&#x27;s Building (LA), founded by graphic designer, Sheila de Bretteville were centers where women artists could work and explore feminist themes. Bookstores specializing in artists&#x27; books were founded, usually by artists, including Ecart in 1968 (Geneva), Other Books and So in 1975 (Amsterdam), Art Metropole in 1974 (Toronto) and Printed Matter in New York (1976). All of these also had publishing programmes over the years, and the latter two are still active today.

In the 1980s this consolidation of the field intensified, with an increasing number of practitioners, greater commercialization, and also the appearance of a number of critical publications devoted to the form. In 1983, for example, Cathy Courtney began a regular column for the London-based &quot;Art Monthly&quot; (Courtney contributed articles for 17 years, and this feature continues today with different contributors). The Library of Congress adopted the term artists books in 1980 in its list of established subjects, and maintains an active collection in its Rare Book and Special Collections Division.

In the 1980s and 1990s, BA, MA and MFA programs in Book Art were founded, some notable examples of which are the MFA at Mills College in California, the MFA at The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, the MA at Camberwell College of Arts in London, and the BA at the College of Creative Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The Journal of Artists&#x27; Books (JAB) was founded in 1994 to &quot;raise the level of critical inquiry about artists&#x27; books.&quot;

In 1994, a National Book Art Exhibition, &quot;Art ex libris&quot;, was held at Artspace Gallery in Richmond, Virginia, and the Virginia Commission for the Arts awarded a technical assistance grant for videotaping the exhibition.

In 1995, excerpts from &quot;Art ex Libris: The National Book Art Invitational at Artspace&quot; video documentary were shown in the Frances and Armand Hammer Auditorium at the 4th Biannual Book Arts Fair sponsored by Pyramid Atlantic Art Center at the Corcoran Gallery of Art. In 1996, the &quot;Art ex Libris&quot; documentary was included in an auction at Swann Galleries to benefit the Center for Book Arts in New York City. Many of the books exhibited in &quot;Art ex Libris&quot; at Artspace Gallery and &quot;Art ex Machina&quot; at 1708 Gallery are now in the Sackner Archive of Concrete and Visual Poetry in Miami, Florida.

In recent decades the artist&#x27;s book has been developed, by way of the artists&#x27; record album concept pioneered by Laurie Anderson into new media forms including the artist&#x27;s CD-ROM and the artist&#x27;s DVD-ROM. Beginning in 2007, the Codex Foundation began its Book Fair and Symposium, a biennial 4-day event in the San Francisco Bay Area attended by collectors and producers of artist books as well as laypeople and academics interested in the medium.

==Critical issues and debate==

A number of issues around the artist&#x27;s book have been vigorously debated. Some of the major themes under examination have been:

# Definition of the artist&#x27;s book: distinguishing between the terms &quot;artist&#x27;s book&quot;, &quot;book art&quot;, &quot;bookworks&quot;, &quot;livre d&#x27;artiste&quot;, fine press books, etc.
# Where the artist&#x27;s book &quot;should&quot; be situated in relation to Craft and Fine Art traditions.
# Where to put the apostrophe.
# When is a magazine a book? Some examples of &quot;artists&#x27; books&quot; provided on this page (such as Theo van Doesburg&#x27;s &quot;De Stijl&quot;) are magazines and not books at all.
# Publishing as an explicitly political act and the desire to challenge an art establishment.
# Publishing as an implicitly political act and its challenge to imagine a new kind of reading.

Practitioners have asserted that the term artist&#x27;s book is problematic and sound outdated:

<text>The Gamble House, also known as the David B. Gamble House, is a historic American Craftsman home in Pasadena, California, designed by the architectural firm Greene and Greene. Constructed in 1908–1909 as a home for David B. Gamble, son of the Procter &amp; Gamble founder James Gamble, it is today a National Historic Landmark, a California Historical Landmark, and open to the public for tours and events.

==History==

One major feature of the Gamble House was to be distinct from many other houses nearby, such as the Neoclassical style Fenyes House (Robert Farquhar, 1906–1907). Considering that many Greene and Greene projects have been altered to some degree and stripped of their original furnishings designed for them by the architects, this house has been well maintained throughout its exterior and interior.

David and Mary Gamble lived in the house during the winter months until their deaths in 1923 and 1929, respectively. Mary&#x27;s younger sister Julia lived in the house until her death in 1943. Cecil Huggins Gamble and his wife Louise Gibbs Gamble lived in the house beginning in 1946. They briefly considered selling it, until prospective buyers spoke of painting the interior woodwork white. In 1966, the Gamble family turned the house over to the city of Pasadena in a joint agreement with the University of Southern California (USC) School of Architecture. The Gamble House was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977. Today, two 5th-year USC architecture students live in the house full-time; the selected students change annually.

The Gamble House was a target for criticism during the 20th century. However, after the Second World War it received newfound popularity. It was included in a list of all-time top 10 houses in Los Angeles in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; survey of experts in December 2008.

The exterior of the house gained worldwide exposure as the Brown Mansion, the home (in 1955) of Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown in the 1985 movie &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and more prominently in the 1990 &quot;Back to the Future III.

Additionally, the house was featured on &quot;This Old House&quot; with then host Bob Vila in 1987.

==Design==

Originally built as a winter residence for David and Mary Gamble, the three-story Gamble House is commonly described as America&#x27;s Arts and Crafts masterpiece. Its style shows influence from traditional Japanese aesthetics and a certain California spaciousness born of available land and a permissive climate. The Arts and Crafts Movement in American Craftsman style architecture was focused on the use of natural materials, attention to detail, aesthetics, and craftsmanship.

The house is located on a grassy knoll overlooking Pasadena&#x27;s Arroyo Seco, a broad, seasonally dry river bed. Because of the Gambles’ attraction to the environment, the Greenes designed the house to complement the rustic setting. The house&#x27;s design reflected the Gambles&#x27; love of nature as flowers and trees were brought to the interior—creating pictures in wood, metal, art glass, and semi-precious stone. The building itself appears enmeshed with the landscape, achieved by a blend of man-made materials such as brick and rough dash-coat stucco and natural materials such as granite river stones and creeping fig that grows up onto the foundations of the terrace and steps.
The house displays a strong influence of Japanese architecture. The abstraction of clouds and mist as well as the other &quot;oriental&quot; characteristics applied to the house&#x27;s doors, windows, screens, beams, chair, lanterns, and more were another way that the house showed its emphasis on nature as &quot;forms found in nature are the inspiration for these patterns.&quot;
Another way the Greenes showed off the Gamble House&#x27;s emphasis on nature was through the &quot;theme of three,&quot; which was composed of three components that could be seen in every room. The theme of three grouped objects together, sometimes symmetrically arranged, but often not. The use of asymmetry alongside the classical balance reflects nature&#x27;s welcoming of variety in proportions.

===Interiors===

The rooms of the home were built using multiple kinds of woods. Teak, maple, oak, Port Orford cedar, and mahogany surfaces are placed in sequences to bring out contrasts of color, tone, and grain. Inlay in the custom furniture designed by the architects coordinates with the inlay in the tiled fireplace surrounds, and the expressed, interlocking joinery on the main staircase was left exposed.

One of the wooden panels in the entry hall is actually a concealed door leading to the kitchen, and another panel opens to a coat closet.

The Greenes used an experienced team of local contractors who had worked together for them in Pasadena on several previous homes, including the Hall brothers, Peter and John, who were responsible for the high quality of the woodworking in the house and its furniture. The Gamble family crest, a crane and trailing rose, was integrated in part or whole in many locations around the house.

The woods, the low and horizontal room shapes, and the natural light that filters through the art glass exterior windows coexist with a relatively traditional plan, in which most rooms are regularly shaped and organized around a central hall. Although the house is not as spatially adventurous as the contemporary works of Frank Lloyd Wright, or even of the earlier New England &quot;Shingle style,&quot; its mood is casual and its symmetries tend to be localized.

Ceiling heights are different on the first (8&#x27;10&quot;) and second floors (8&#x27;8&quot;) and in the den (9&#x27;10&quot;) and the forms and scales of the spaces are constantly shifting, especially as one moves from the interior of the house to its second-floor semi-enclosed porches and its free-form terraces, front and rear. The third floor was planned as a billiard room but was used as an attic by the Gamble family.

===Rooms===
The living room was designed without any entry doors so that the room would be as open and inviting as possible. It also consisted of a spacious sitting room, which was decorated with five rugs that were designed by Charles Greene using watercolor. Across from the fireplace, there is a window that leads to the terrace, which overlooks the garden. The expansive window was designed to let light brighten the room during the late afternoon. At the far end of the room lie bookcases, a small games table, and a piano to offer entertainment and leisure. The piano was designed by the Greenes to blend into the paneling of the room.

On the west wing of the house, the dining room is surrounded by the terrace and the garden on three sides. According to &quot;Gamble House: Greene and Greene&quot;, by Edward R. Bosley, the room was designed to offer &quot;nature to the indoors.&quot; The entrance of the room is diagonal from the hall with two doors. The doors are decorated with cloud-designed glass panels. The transition from hall to room was designed to provide a sense of &quot;anticipation and discovery&quot;.

===Exterior and gardens===
Outdoor space was as important as the interior spaces. Exterior porches are found off three of the second-floor bedrooms and were used for sleeping or entertaining.

The main terrace is beyond the rear facade of the residence. It has patterned brick paving with planting areas, a large curvilinear pond, and garden walls made with distinctive clinker bricks and boulders. Paths made with large water-worn stones from the nearby Arroyo Seco are reminiscent of running brooks crossing the lawns. The overall landscape design and constructed garden elements are integrated with the architectural proportion and detailing. The triple front door and transom feature a Japanese black pine motif in plated (more than one layer) leaded art glass, highlighting the Asian influence that runs throughout the house.

<text>Prosper-René Blondlot (; 3 July 1849 – 24 November 1930) was a French physicist, who in 1891 made the first measurement of the speed of radio waves, but is now mostly remembered for his &quot;discovery&quot; of N rays, a phenomenon that subsequently proved to be illusory.

==Early life and work==
Blondlot was born in Nancy, France, and spent most of his early years there, teaching physics at the University of Nancy, being awarded three prestigious prizes of the Académie des Sciences for his experimental work on the consequences of Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism.

In order to demonstrate that a Kerr cell responds to an applied electric field in a few tens of microseconds, Blondlot, in collaboration with Ernest-Adolphe Bichat, adapted the rotating-mirror method that Léon Foucault had applied to measure the speed of light. He further developed the rotating mirror to measure the speed of electricity in a conductor, photographing the sparks emitted from two conductors, one 1.8 km longer than the other and measuring the relative displacement of their images. He thus established that the speed of electricity in a conductor is very close to that of light.

In 1891, he made the first measurement of the speed of radio waves, by measuring the wavelength using Lecher lines. He used 13 different frequencies between 10 and 30 MHz and obtained an average value of 297,600 km/s, which is within 1% of the current value for the speed of light. This was an important confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s theory that light was an electromagnetic wave like radio waves.

== N rays==
In 1903, Blondlot announced that he had discovered N rays, a new species of radiation. The &quot;discovery&quot; attracted much attention over the following year and many physicists worked, unsuccessfully, to replicate the effects.

The French Academy of Sciences awarded the Prix Leconte (₣50,000) for 1904 to Blondlot, citing the totality of his work rather than the discovery of N-rays.

American physicist Robert W. Wood, who had a reputation as a popular &quot;debunker&quot; of nonsense during the period, showed that the phenomena were purely subjective with no physical origin and by 1905, no one outside of Nancy believed in N rays; but Blondlot himself is reported to have still been convinced of their existence in 1926.

The incident is now used as a cautionary tale among scientists on the dangers of error introduced by experimenter bias.

==Later years==
Little is known about Blondlot&#x27;s later years. William Seabrook stated in his Wood biography &quot;Doctor Wood&quot;, that Blondlot went insane and died, supposedly as a result of the exposure of the N ray debacle: &quot;This tragic exposure eventually led to Blondlot&#x27;s madness and death.&quot; Using an almost identical wording, this statement was repeated later by Martin Gardner: &quot;Wood&#x27;s exposure led to Blondlot&#x27;s madness and death.&quot; However, Blondlot continued to work as a university professor in Nancy until his early retirement in 1910. He died at the age of 81; at the time of the N-ray affair, he was about 54–55 years old.

<doc id="463601" wikidata="Q414015" url="?curid=463601" title="Yttrium barium copper oxide">
<text>Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) is a family of crystalline chemical compounds that display high-temperature superconductivity; it includes the first material ever discovered to become superconducting above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen [] at about .

Many YBCO compounds have the general formula (also known as Y123), although materials with other Y:Ba:Cu ratios exist, such as (Y124) or (Y247). At present, there is no singularly recognised theory for high-temperature superconductivity.

It is part of the more general group of rare-earth barium copper oxides (ReBCO) in which, instead of yttrium, other rare earths are present.

==History==
In April 1986, Georg Bednorz and Karl Müller, working at IBM in Zurich, discovered that certain semiconducting oxides became superconducting at relatively high temperature, in particular, a lanthanum barium copper oxide becomes superconducting at 35 K. This oxide was an oxygen-deficient perovskite-related material that proved promising and stimulated the search for related compounds with higher superconducting transition temperatures. In 1987, Bednorz and Müller were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work.

Following Bednorz and Müller&#x27;s discovery, a team led by Paul Ching Wu Chu at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and University of Houston discovered that YBCO has a superconducting transition critical temperature (&quot;T&quot;c) of 93 K. The first samples were Y1.2Ba0.8CuO4, but this was an average composition for two phases, a black and a green one. Workers at Bell Laboratories identified the black phase as the superconductor, determined its composition YBa2Cu3O7−δ and synthesized it in single phase

YBCO was the first material found to become superconducting above 77 K, the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, whereas the majority of other superconductors require more expensive cryogens. Nonetheless, YBCO and its many related materials have yet to displace superconductors requiring liquid helium for cooling.

==Synthesis==
Relatively pure YBCO was first synthesized by heating a mixture of the metal carbonates at temperatures between 1000 and 1300 K.

:4 BaCO3 + Y2(CO3)3 + 6 CuCO3 + (−&quot;x&quot;) O2 → 2 YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot; + 13 CO2

Modern syntheses of YBCO use the corresponding oxides and nitrates.

The superconducting properties of YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot; are sensitive to the value of &quot;x&quot;, its oxygen content. Only those materials with are superconducting below &quot;T&quot;c, and when , the material superconducts at the highest temperature of , or in highest magnetic fields: for B perpendicular and for B parallel to the CuO2 planes.

In addition to being sensitive to the stoichiometry of oxygen, the properties of YBCO are influenced by the crystallization methods used. Care must be taken to sinter YBCO. YBCO is a crystalline material, and the best superconductive properties are obtained when crystal grain boundaries are aligned by careful control of annealing and quenching temperature rates.

Numerous other methods to synthesize YBCO have developed since its discovery by Wu and his co-workers, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), sol-gel, and aerosol methods. These alternative methods, however, still require careful sintering to produce a quality product.

However, new possibilities have been opened since the discovery that trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), a source of fluorine, prevents the formation of the undesired barium carbonate (BaCO3). Routes such as CSD (chemical solution deposition) have opened a wide range of possibilities, particularly in the preparation of long YBCO tapes. This route lowers the temperature necessary to get the correct phase to around . This, and the lack of dependence on vacuum, makes this method a very promising way to get scalable YBCO tapes.

==Structure==

YBCO crystallizes in a defect perovskite structure. It can be viewed as a layered structure: the boundary of each layer is defined by planes of square planar CuO4 units sharing 4 vertices. The planes can sometimes be slightly puckered. Perpendicular to these CuO4 planes are CuO2 ribbons sharing 2 vertices. The yttrium atoms are found between the CuO4 planes, while the barium atoms are found between the CuO2 ribbons and the CuO4 planes. This structural feature is illustrated in the figure to the right.


Although YBa2Cu3O7 is a well-defined chemical compound with a specific structure and stoichiometry, materials with fewer than seven oxygen atoms per formula unit are non-stoichiometric compounds. The structure of these materials depends on the oxygen content. This non-stoichiometry is denoted by the x in the chemical formula YBa2Cu3O7−&quot;x&quot;. When &quot;x&quot; = 1, the O(1) sites in the Cu(1) layer (as labelled in the unit cell) are vacant and the structure is tetragonal. The tetragonal form of YBCO is insulating and does not superconduct. Increasing the oxygen content slightly causes more of the O(1) sites to become occupied. For &quot;x&quot; &lt; 0.65, Cu-O chains along the &quot;b&quot; axis of the crystal are formed. Elongation of the &quot;b&quot; axis changes the structure to orthorhombic, with lattice parameters of &quot;a&quot; = 3.82, &quot;b&quot; = 3.89, and &quot;c&quot; = 11.68 Å. Optimum superconducting properties occur when &quot;x&quot; ~ 0.07, i.e., almost all of the O(1) sites are occupied, with few vacancies.

In experiments where other elements are substituted on the Cu and Ba sites, evidence has shown that conduction occurs in the Cu(2)O planes while the Cu(1)O(1) chains act as charge reservoirs, which provide carriers to the CuO planes. However, this model fails to address superconductivity in the homologue Pr123 (praseodymium instead of yttrium). This (conduction in the copper planes) confines conductivity to the &quot;a&quot;-&quot;b&quot; planes and a large anisotropy in transport properties is observed. Along the &quot;c&quot; axis, normal conductivity is 10 times smaller than in the &quot;a&quot;-&quot;b&quot; plane. For other cuprates in the same general class, the anisotropy is even greater and inter-plane transport is highly restricted.

Furthermore, the superconducting length scales show similar anisotropy, in both penetration depth (λab ≈ 150 nm, λc ≈ 800 nm) and coherence length, (ξab ≈ 2 nm, ξc ≈ 0.4 nm). Although the coherence length in the &quot;a&quot;-&quot;b&quot; plane is 5 times greater than that along the &quot;c&quot; axis it is quite small compared to classic superconductors such as niobium (where ξ ≈ 40 nm). This modest coherence length means that the superconducting state is more susceptible to local disruptions from interfaces or defects on the order of a single unit cell, such as the boundary between twinned crystal domains. This sensitivity to small defects complicates fabricating devices with YBCO, and the material is also sensitive to degradation from humidity.

==Proposed applications==

Many possible applications of this and related high temperature superconducting materials have been discussed. For example, superconducting materials are finding use as magnets in magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic levitation, and Josephson junctions. (The most used material for power cables and magnets is BSCCO.)

YBCO has yet to be used in many applications involving superconductors for two primary reasons:
*First, although single crystals of YBCO have a very high critical current density, polycrystals have a very low critical current density: only a small current can be passed while maintaining superconductivity. This problem is due to crystal grain boundaries in the material. When the grain boundary angle is greater than about 5°, the supercurrent cannot cross the boundary. The grain boundary problem can be controlled to some extent by preparing thin films via CVD or by texturing the material to align the grain boundaries.
*A second problem limiting the use of this material in technological applications is associated with processing of the material. Oxide materials such as this are brittle, and forming them into superconducting wires by any conventional process does not produce a useful superconductor. (Unlike BSCCO, the powder-in-tube process does not give good results with YBCO.)
The most promising method developed to utilize this material involves deposition of YBCO on flexible metal tapes coated with buffering metal oxides. This is known as . Texture (crystal plane alignment) can be introduced into the metal tape (the RABiTS process) or a textured ceramic buffer layer can be deposited, with the aid of an ion beam, on an untextured alloy substrate (the IBAD process). Subsequent oxide layers prevent diffusion of the metal from the tape into the superconductor while transferring the template for texturing the superconducting layer. Novel variants on CVD, PVD, and solution deposition techniques are used to produce long lengths of the final YBCO layer at high rates. Companies pursuing these processes include American Superconductor, Superpower (a division of Furukawa Electric), Sumitomo, Fujikura, Nexans Superconductors, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, and European Advanced Superconductors. A much larger number of research institutes have also produced YBCO tape by these methods.

The superconducting tape is used for SPARC, a tokamak fusion reactor design that can achieve breakeven energy production.

==Surface modification==
Surface modification of materials has often led to new and improved properties. Corrosion inhibition, polymer adhesion and nucleation, preparation of organic superconductor/insulator/high-&quot;T&quot;c superconductor trilayer structures, and the fabrication of metal/insulator/superconductor tunnel junctions have been developed using surface-modified YBCO.

These molecular layered materials are synthesized using cyclic voltammetry. Thus far, YBCO layered with alkylamines, arylamines, and thiols have been produced with varying stability of the molecular layer. It has been proposed that amines act as Lewis bases and bind to Lewis acidic Cu surface sites in YBa2Cu3O7 to form stable coordination bonds.

==Mass production==

In 1987, shortly after it was discovered, physicist and science author Paul Grant published in the U.K. Journal &quot;New Scientist&quot; a straightforward guide for synthesizing YBCO superconductors using widely-available equipment. Thanks in part to this article and similar publications at the time, YBCO has become a popular high-temperature superconductor for use by hobbyists and in education, as the magnetic levitation effect can be easily demonstrated using liquid nitrogen as coolant.

In 2021, SuperOx, a Russian and Japanese company, developed a new manufacturing process for making YBCO wire for fusion reactors. This new wire was shown to conduct between 700 and 2000 Amps per square millimeter. The company was able to produce 186 miles of wire in 9 months, between 2019 and 2021, dramatically improving the production capacity. The company used a plasma-laser deposition process, on a electropolished substrate to make 12-mm width tape and then slit it into 3-mm tape.

<text>Jonathan Simon Speelman (born 2 October 1956 in Marylebone, London) is a British chess player and author. He was awarded the title of Grandmaster in 1980.

==Early life and education==
Speelman was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London and Worcester College, Oxford, where he read mathematics.

==Career==
A winner of the British Chess Championship in 1978, 1985 and 1986, Speelman has been a regular member of the English team for the Chess Olympiad, an international biennial chess tournament organised by FIDE, the World Chess Federation.

He qualified for two Candidates Tournaments:

*In the 1989–1990 cycle, Speelman qualified by placing third in the 1987 interzonal tournament held in Subotica, Yugoslavia. After beating Yasser Seirawan in his first round 4–1, and Nigel Short in the second round 3½–1½, he lost to Jan Timman at the semi-final stage 4½–3½.
*In the following 1990–93 championship cycle, he lost 5½–4½ in the first round to Short, the eventual challenger for Garry Kasparov&#x27;s crown.

In 1989, Speelman beat Kasparov in a televised speed tournament and then went on to win the event.

On 7 December 1990, Speelman was featured in an experimental interactive BBC2 broadcast called &quot;Your Move&quot;, which was hosted by Rob Curling and commentated by chess writer William Hartston. In the groundbreaking one-off episode, Speelman was pitted against the audience, who would use a special telephone line to submit their moves, with the move played by the viewers being decided by a democratic vote. Speelman won the match. The broadcast went for approximately three hours, about double the time that it had been scheduled for.

===Writing===
He has written a number of books on chess, including several on the endgame, among them &quot;Analysing the Endgame&quot; (1981), &quot;Endgame Preparation&quot; (1981) and &quot;Batsford Chess Endings&quot; (co-author, 1993).

Among his other books are &quot;Best Games 1970–1980&quot; (1982), an analysis of nearly fifty of the best games by top players from that decade, and &quot;Jon Speelman&#x27;s Best Games&quot; (1997). Today he is primarily a chess journalist and commentator, being the chess correspondent for &quot;The Observer&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot; and sometimes providing commentary for games on the Internet Chess Club.

<doc id="463610" wikidata="Q1392699" url="?curid=463610" title="Battle of Blood River">
<text>The Battle of Blood River (16 December 1838) was fought on the bank of the Ncome River, in what is today KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 464 Voortrekkers (&quot;Pioneers&quot;), led by Andries Pretorius, and an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 Zulu. Estimations of casualties amounted to over 3,000 of King Dingane&#x27;s soldiers dead, including two Zulu princes competing with Prince Mpande for the Zulu throne. Three Voortrekker commando members were lightly wounded, including Pretorius. 

The year 1838 was the most difficult period for the Voortrekkers from when they left the Cape Colony, till the end of the Great Trek. They faced many difficulties and much bloodshed before they found freedom and a safe homeland in their Republic of Natalia. This was only achieved after defeating the Zulu Kingdom, at the Battle of Blood River, which took place on Sunday 16 December 1838. This battle would not have taken place if the Zulu King had honoured the agreement that he had made with the Voortrekkers to live together peacefully. The Zulu king knew that they outnumbered the Voortrekkers and decided to overthrow them and that led to the Battle of Blood River.

In January 1840 Prince Mpande finally defeated King Dingane in the Battle of Maqongqe and was subsequently crowned as new king of the Zulu by his alliance partner Andries Pretorius. After these two battles, Dingane&#x27;s prime minister and commander in the Battle of Blood River, General Ndlela, who had also been Mpande’s personal protector, was strangled to death by Dingane for high treason.

==Background==
The trekkers—called Voortrekkers after 1880—had to defend themselves after the betrayal murder of chief Trekker leader Piet Retief and his entire entourage, and ten days later the Weenen/Bloukrans massacre where &quot;not a soul was spared.&quot;

Dingane had agreed that, if Retief could recover approximately 700 head of cattle stolen from the Zulus by the Tlokwa, he would let them have land upon which to establish farms.

On 6 February 1838, two days after the signing of a negotiated land settlement deal between Retief and Dingane at UmGungundlovu, written by Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817–1887) which included Trekker access to Port Natal, which the British also had interest in, Dingane invited Retief and his party into his royal residence for a beer-drinking farewell. The accompanying request for the surrender of Trekker muskets at the entrance was taken as normal protocol when appearing before the king. While the Trekkers were being entertained by Dingane&#x27;s dancing warriors/soldiers, Dingane suddenly accused the visiting party of witchcraft and ordered his men: &quot;Bulalani abathakathi&quot; (Kill the sorcerers...). Dingane&#x27;s soldiers bludgeoned Retief&#x27;s party to death.

Immediately after the UmGungundlovu massacre, Dingane sent out his impis (regiments) to attack several Trekker encampments at night time, killing an estimated 500 men, women, children, and servants, most notably at Blaukraans.

Help arrived from farmers in the Cape Colony, and the Trekkers in Natal subsequently requested the pro-independence Andries Pretorius to leave the Cape Colony, in order to defend the Voortrekkers who had settled in Natal.

After the Battle of Blood River, the Dingane-Retief treaty written by Jan Gerritze Bantjes was found on Retief&#x27;s bodily remains, providing a driving force for an overt alliance against Dingane between Prince Mpande and Pretorius.

==Prelude==
===War strategies of the generals===
On 26 November 1838, Andries Pretorius (1798–1853) was appointed as Commander of 64 wagons and 464+ heavily armed Boer combatants directed against Dingane at UmGungundlovu with Jan Gerritze Bantjes (1817–1882) as his war secretary. By December 1838, Prince Mpande and 17,000 followers had already fled from Dingane, who was seeking to assassinate Mpande. In support of Prince Mpande as Dingane&#x27;s replacement, Pretorius&#x27; strategy was to target Dingane only. To allow Prince Mpande to oust King Dingane through military might, Pretorius had first to weaken Dingane&#x27;s personal military power base in UmGungundlovu. Dingane&#x27;s royal residence at UmGungundlovu was naturally protected against attack by hilly and rocky terrain all around, as well as an access route via Italeni passing through a narrow gorge called a defile.

Earlier on 9 April 1838, a Trekker horse commando without ox wagons, thereafter called the &quot;Flight Commando&quot;, had unsuccessfully attempted to penetrate the UmGungundlovu defense at nearby Italeni valley, resulting in the loss of several Trekker lives. Trekker leader Hendrik Potgieter had abandoned all hope of engaging Dingane in UmGungundlovu after losing the battle of Italeni, and subsequently had migrated with his group out of Natal. To approach UmGungundlovu via the Italeni defile with ox wagons would force the wagons into an open column, instead of an enclosed laager as successfully employed defensively at Veglaer on 12 August 1838.

The military commander during Dingane&#x27;s attack on Veglaer was Ndlela kaSompisi. The highly experienced general Ndlela had served under Shaka, and was also prime minister and chief advisor under Dingane. Ndlela with his 10,000 troops had retreated from Veglaer, after three days and nights of fruitless attempts to penetrate the enclosed Trekker wagon laager.

General Ndlela personally protected Prince Mpande from Dingane&#x27;s repeated assassination plans. King Dingane desired to have his half brother Mpande, the only prince with children, eliminated as a threat to his throne. Prince Mpande was married to Msukilethe, a daughter of general Ndlela. General Ndlela, like Pretorius the promoter of Prince Mpande, was responsible for Dingane&#x27;s UmGungundlovu defense during the Trekkers&#x27; second attack attempt under Pretorius in December 1838. Given general Ndlela&#x27;s previous defense and attack experience at Italeni and Veglaer during April 1838 and August 1838 respectively, Ndlela&#x27;s tactical options were limited. Proven UmGungundlovu defense tactics were to attack Trekker commandos in the rocky and hilly terrain on the narrowing access route at Italeni, thereby neutralising the advantages mounted riflemen had over spear-carrying foot soldiers. Ndlela had to let Pretorius come close to UmGungundlovu at Italeni and lure the Trekkers into attack. Ndlela was not to attack the Trekkers when they were in a defensive wagon laager position, especially not during the day. The problem for Pretorius was that he had somehow to find a way to make Dingane&#x27;s soldiers attack him in a defensive laager position at a place of his choice, far away from UmGungundlovu and Italeni.

On 6 December 1838, 10 days before the Battle of Blood River, Pretorius and his commando including Alexander Biggar as translator had a meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, so named for the Zulu dancing that took place in the Zulu kraal that the Trekker commando visited. With the intelligence received at Danskraal, Pretorius became confident enough to propose a vow to God, which demanded the celebration, by the commando and their posterity, of the coming victory over Dingane. The covenant included that a church would be built in honour of God, should the commando be successful and reach UmGungundlovu alive in order to diminish the power of Dingane. Building a church in Trekker emigrant context was symbol for establishing a settled state.

After the meeting with friendly Zulu chiefs at Danskraal, Pretorius let the commando relax and do their washing for a few days at Wasbank till 9 December 1838. From Wasbank they slowly and daily moved closer to the site of the Battle of Blood River, practising laager defence tactics every evening for a week long. Then, by halting his advance towards UmGungundlovu on 15 December 1838, 40 km before reaching the defile at Italeni, Pretorius had eliminated the Italeni terrain trap.

===Location and preparation===
On Saturday, 15 December 1838, after the Trekker wagons crossed the Buffalo River 10 km SW of the actual battle site and still from their target UmGungundlovu, an advance scouting party including Pretorius got news of a large Zulu force in rugged terrain to the east trying to lure the Boers into a trap as had been the case in April the same year with fatal consequences. While Cilliers wanted to ride out and attack, Pretorius declined the opportunity to engage Dingane&#x27;s soldiers away from their base as had been the trap at Italeni valley. Instead, Pretorius decided on a fortified laager on the terrain of his own choosing in the hope that general Ndlela would attack Pretorius on his terms rather than the other way around.

As the site for the defensive wagon laager, Pretorius chose a defensible position close to a vertical 8m descent into a deep hippo pool in the Ncombe River providing excellent protection on two sides. The wide-open area to the front of the laager provided absolutely no cover for an attacking force. The battle was set with the laager protected on two flanks. As usual, the ox-wagons were drawn into the typical protective enclosure or &quot;laager&quot;. Movable wooden barriers and ladders which could be quickly opened for cavalry were fastened between the wagon wheels to prevent intruders, with two smoothbore, short barrel artillery pieces positioned at the corners. Andries Pretorius had brought a 6-pound naval carronade with him from the Cape, mounted on a gun carriage improvised from a wagon axle, and named &quot;Grietjie&quot;. The other ordnance piece is unknown in the original, but the reproduction depicts a 4-pound smoothbore cannon by then obsolete in most European armies. Both were used to fire devastating grapeshot.

As evening approached, a thick mist settled over the wagon site above which the sky was clear. According to Afrikaner traditions, the Zulu were afraid to attack at the night due to superstitions and the eerie glow of lamps which the Boers hung on &quot;sjamboks&quot; [whip-stocks] around the laager. Whether or not there is any truth in this, historian S.P. Mackenzie has speculated that the Zulu held back until what they perceived as the necessary numbers had arrived. Some of the Zulus only arrived near sunrise by following the tracks of the wagons. Due to some recent heavy rains the Ncombe River was swollen making crossing the river difficult.

During the night of 15 December, six Zulu regiments, an estimated 20,000 (or more) Zulu soldiers led by Dambuza (Nzobo), crossed the Ncome River and started massing around the encampment, while the elite forces of senior general Ndlela did not cross the river, thereby splitting the army in two.

==Battle==
On 16 December, dawn broke on a clear day, revealing that &quot;all of Zululand sat there&quot;, according to one Trekker eyewitness. General Ndlela and his crack troops, the Black and White Shields, remained on the other side of the river, observing Dambuza&#x27;s men at the laager from a safe position across the hippo pool. According to the South African Department of Art and Culture:

In ceremonies that lasted about three days, &quot;izinyanga zempi&quot;, specialist war doctors, prepared &quot;izinteleze&quot; medicines which made warriors invincible in the face of their opponents.
This could partly help explain why Dambuza&#x27;s forces were sitting on the ground close to the wagon laager when the Trekkers first saw them.

Dambuza&#x27;s regiments repeatedly stormed the &quot;laager&quot; but could not break through. The attackers were hindered by a change introduced during Shaka&#x27;s rule that replaced most of the longer throwing spears with short stabbing spears. In close combat the stabbing spear provided obvious advantages over its longer cousin. A Zulu eyewitness said that their first charge was mown down like grass by the Boer muskets.

As Bantjes wrote in his journal:

With the power of their firearms and with their ox wagons in a laager formation and some effective tactics, the Boers fought off the Zulu. Buckshot was used to maximise casualties. Mackenzie claims that 200 indigenous servants looked after the horses and cattle and helped load muskets, but no definite proof or witness of servants helping to reload is available. Writing in the popular Afrikaans magazine &quot;Die Huisgenoot&quot;, a Dr. D.J. Kotze said that this group consisted of fifty-nine &quot;non-white helpers and followers&quot; instead of the commonly stated two hundred.

After two hours and four waves of attack, with the intermittent lulls providing crucial reloading and resting opportunities for the Trekkers, Pretorius ordered a group of horsemen to leave the encampment and engage the Zulu in order to induce the disintegration of their formations. The Zulu withstood the charge for some time, but rapid losses led them to scatter. The Trekkers pursued their fleeing enemies and hunted them down for three hours. Cilliers noted later that &quot;we left the Kafirs lying on the ground as thick almost as pumpkins upon the field that has borne a plentiful crop.&quot; Bantjes recorded that about 3,000 dead Zulu had been counted, and three Trekkers were wounded. During the chase, Pretorius was wounded in his left hand by an &quot;assegaai&quot; (Zulu spear). Of the 3,000 dead Zulu soldiers, two were princes, leaving Ndlela&#x27;s favourite Prince Mpande as frontrunner in the subsequent battle for the Zulu crown.

Four days after the Battle of Blood River, the Trekker commando arrived at King Dingane&#x27;s great kraal UmGungundlovu (near present-day Eshowe), only to find it deserted and in ashes. The bones of Retief and his men were found and buried, where a memorial stands today. Up to this day 16 December is a public holiday in South Africa; before 1994 it was known as &quot;the Day of the Vow&quot;, &quot;the Day of the Covenant&quot; and &quot;Dingaan&#x27;s Day&quot;; but today it is &quot;the Day of Reconciliation&quot;.

==Aftermath==
The conflict between Dingane and the Trekkers continued for one more year after the Battle of Blood River. The idea of a decisive victory may have been planted in Pretorius&#x27; mind by a Zulu prisoner, who said that most of Dingane&#x27;s warriors had either been killed or fled. The same prisoner led some of the Trekker party into a trap at the White Umfolozi River, eleven days after the battle at Ncome River. This time the Zulu were victorious. Only when Dingane&#x27;s brother, Mpande, openly joined the Trekker side with his sizeable army, was Dingane finally defeated in January 1840.

Following the Battle of Maqongqe in January 1840, the forces of Mpande did not wait for Pretorius&#x27; cavalry to arrive, and they attacked the remaining regiments of Dingane, who were again under the command of General Ndlela. Ndlela strayed from normal fighting tactics against Mpande, sending in his regiments to fight one at a time, instead of together in ox horn formation. Maquongqe Dingane had to flee Natal completely, but before he did so, he had Ndlela slowly strangled by cow hide for high treason, on the grounds that he had fought for Mpande, with the same disastrous result for Dingane as at Ncome-Blood River. Dambusa, Dingane&#x27;s other general, had already been executed by Mpande and Pretorius when he fell into their hands before the battle.

Pretorius approved and attended the crowning of Zulu King Mpande in Pietermaritzburg. They agreed on the Tugela River as the border between Zululand and the Republic of Natalia.

==Legacy==
Popular Afrikaner interpretations of the Battle of Blood River (bolstered by sympathetic historians such as George Theal) played a central role in fostering Afrikaner nationalism . They believe that the battle demonstrated God&#x27;s intervention and hence their divine right to exist as an independent people. This is stated in the official guidebook of the Voortrekker Monument (unveiled during the centenary celebrations of the Great Trek on 16 December 1949) that Afrikaners were a nation of heroes exemplifies the conclusions drawn from such events. From the Day of the Vow, Afrikaners consider the site and the commemoration of the day as sacred.

Historian S.P. Mackenzie doubts the reported number of Zulu deaths. He compares Zulu casualties at Ncome to battles at Italeni, Isandlwana, and Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Mackenzie acknowledges that the casualty count was not impossible. Yet, in a similar victory on 15 October 1836 by Trekkers under Hendrik Potgieter over some 9,000 Matabele, the latter suffered only 350 casualties. In 1879, 600 British soldiers with breech-loading rifles caused 2,000 Zulu casualties, perhaps 1,000 killed over three hours before being overrun.

===Ncome/Blood River monument===

A church, called &quot;the Church of the Vow&quot;, was built in the Natal town of Pietermaritzburg in 1841, where Pretorius settled on the farm &quot;Welverdient&quot; (English: &quot;Well-earned&quot;), a gift from the Trekkers.

A monument was erected on the site of the battle in 1947, consisting of an ox wagon executed in granite by the sculptor Coert Steynberg. In 1971 a laager of 64 ox wagons cast in bronze (by Unifront Foundry in Edenvale – Fanie de Klerk and Jack Cowlard) was erected, and unveiled on 16 December 1972.
The Ncome monument on the east side of the river commemorates the fallen Zulu warriors. While the Blood River Memorial is associated with Afrikaner nationalism, the Ncome monument was intended as a symbol of reconciliation—but has become connected with Zulu nationalism.

At 16 December 1998 inauguration of the most recent version of the monument, the Zulu politician and then Minister of Home Affairs, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, apologised to the Afrikaner nation for the death of Piet Retief and the subsequent suffering. At the same time Buthelezi also noted the suffering of the Zulus during Apartheid. He stressed that South Africans needed to consider the day as &quot;a new covenant which binds us to the shared commitment of building a new country.&quot;

Today two complexes mark the battle site: the Ncome Monument and Museum Complex east of the Ncome River, and the Blood River Monument and Museum Complex to the west.

===Ndlela monument===
South Africa&#x27;s former president, Jacob Zuma, attended the official inauguration of the Ndlela monument in Eshowe, Kwazulu-Natal.

=== President Cyril Ramaphosa&#x27;s 2019 speech ===
On the Day of Reconciliation 2019, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described the Voortrekkers as invaders and the Zulu army as &quot;Freedom Fighters&quot;. Dirk Hermann, managing director of the trade union Solidarity, criticised this historical claim as inaccurate and as a &quot;criminalisation of Afrikaner history&quot;, and emphasised the reconciliatory message of politician Mangosuthu Buthelezi.

<text>In computing, configuration files (commonly known simply as config files) are files used to configure the parameters and initial settings for some computer programs or applications, server processes and operating system settings.

Some applications provide tools to create, modify, and verify the syntax of their configuration files; these sometimes have graphical interfaces. For other programs, system administrators may be expected to create and modify files by hand using a text editor, which is possible because many are human-editable plain text files. For server processes and operating-system settings, there is often no standard tool, but operating systems may provide their own graphical interfaces such as YaST or debconf.

Some computer programs only read their configuration files at startup. Others periodically check the configuration files for changes. Users can instruct some programs to re-read the configuration files and apply the changes to the current process, or indeed to read arbitrary files as a configuration file. There are no definitive standards or strong conventions.

==Configuration files and operating systems==

===Unix and Unix-like operating systems===
Across Unix-like operating systems many different configuration-file formats exist, with each application or service potentially having a unique format, but there is a strong tradition of them being in human-editable plain text, and a simple key–value pair format is common. Filename extensions of codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 or codice_5 are often used.

Almost all formats allow comments, in which case, individual settings can be disabled by prepending with the comment character. Often the default configuration files contain extensive internal documentation in the form of comments and man files are also typically used to document the format and options available.

System-wide software often uses configuration files stored in codice_6, while user applications often use a &quot;dotfile&quot; – a file or directory in the home directory prefixed with a period, which in Unix hides the file or directory from casual listing. Since this causes pollution, newer user applications generally make their own folder in the codice_7 directory, a standardized subdirectory of the home directory.

Some configuration files run a set of commands upon startup. A common convention is for such files to have &quot;codice_8&quot; in their name, typically using the name of the program then an &quot;codice_9&quot; suffix e.g. &quot;codice_10&quot;, &quot;codice_11&quot;, &quot;codice_12&quot;, &quot;codice_13&quot;. See run commands for further details.

By contrast, IBM&#x27;s AIX uses an Object Data Manager (ODM) database to store much of its system settings.

===MS-DOS===
MS-DOS itself primarily relied on just one configuration file, codice_14. This was a plain text file with simple key–value pairs (e.g. codice_15) until MS-DOS 6, which introduced an INI-file style format. There was also a standard plain text batch file named codice_16 that ran a series of commands on boot. Both these files were retained up to Windows 98SE, which still ran on top of MS-DOS.

An example CONFIG.SYS for MS-DOS 5:

DOS=HIGH,UMB
DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
DEVICE=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE RAM
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\ANSI.SYS
FILES=30
SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM C:\DOS /E:512 /P
DOS applications used a wide variety of individual configuration files, most of them binary, proprietary and undocumented - and there were no common conventions or formats.

===Microsoft Windows===

The early Microsoft Windows family of operating systems heavily utilized plain-text INI files (from &quot;initialization&quot;). These served as the primary mechanism to configure the operating system and application features. The APIs to read and write from these still exist in Windows, but after 1993, Microsoft began to steer developers away from using INI files and toward storing settings in the Windows Registry, a hierarchical database to store configuration settings, which was introduced that year with Windows NT.

===macOS===
The Property List is the standard configuration file format in macOS (as well as in iOS, NeXTSTEP, GNUstep and Cocoa applications). It uses the filename extension codice_17.

===IBM OS/2===
IBM&#x27;s OS/2 uses a binary format, also with a .INI suffix, but this differs from the Windows versions. It contains a list of lists of untyped key–value pairs.
Two files control system-wide settings: OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI. Application developers can choose whether to use them or to create a specific file for their applications.

===HarmonyOS and OpenHarmony operating systems ===
HarmonyOS and OpenHarmony-based operating systems uses “config.json” configuration file in the root directory of each HAP application. It contains three modules such as codice_18, codice_19 and codice_20. The codice_21 file adheres to the JSON file format, where each entry comprises an attribute and its corresponding value. The sequence of attribute values is arbitrary, but each attribute must be unique and non-repetitive. The value assigned to each attribute aligns with the fundamental data types of JSON. HarmonyOS’ DevEco Studio provides two methods for editing codice_21: the code editing view and the visual editing view. The `app` object holds the universal configuration details for the application, as demonstrated in the codice_21 configuration file of HarmonyOS&#x27;s foundational application. codice_24 encompasses the configuration details for specific devices, including default, Phone, Tablet, PC, TV, Car, Wearable, liteWearable, and smartVision. The settings under the default label apply to all devices. If there are unique requirements for other devices, the settings under the respective device type label need to be configured. The codice_20 object carries the HAP package configuration details, the essential attributes that each Ability must define (such as package name, class name, type, and capabilities provided by Ability), along with the permissions the application needs to access the system or other protected sections of the application. The codice_26 Indicates the name of HAP package’s entrance ability.

==Serialization formats==
A number of general-purpose serialization formats exist that can represent complex data structures in an easily stored format, and these are often used as a basis for configuration files, particularly in open-source and platform-neutral software applications and libraries. The specifications describing these formats are routinely made available to the public, thus increasing the availability of parsers and emitters across programming languages.
Examples include: JSON, XML, and YAML.

<text>The Balkan Air Force (BAF) was an Allied air formation operating in the Balkans during World War II. Composed of units of the Royal Air Force and South African Air Force under the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces command, it was active from 7 June 1944 until 15 July 1945. Air Vice Marshal William Elliot and then George Mills, both RAF officers, were its Air Officer Commanding (AOC).

The BAF operated mainly over Yugoslavia, supporting the Partisans against Germany and its allies, but occasionally supporting the Greek and Albanian resistance movements also.

==History==
The formation was based at Bari in Italy, and formed on 7 June 1944 from AHQ &#x27;G&#x27; Force, to simplify command arrangements for the air support of Special Operations Executive-operations in the Balkans, i.e. across the Adriatic and in the Aegean and Ionian seas. The Desert Air Force had been responsible for those operations, but its prime job was the support of the troops of the Commonwealth Eighth Army which was fighting its way up through Italy, thus making operations over the Balkans a distraction. The Balkan Air Force was a subordinate to Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, the overall allied air formation in the Mediterranean.

The BAF mainly supported the operations of the Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, against German forces in Yugoslavia, but also provided support to Greek and Albanian resistance organisations. It transported supplies to the Partisans, evacuated wounded, dropped agents to help them, and provided air support in their operations against German troops.

The Balkan Air Force was a multinational unit, with 15 types of aircraft and men from eight nations: Greece, co-belligerent Italy, Poland, South Africa, Yugoslavia, the UK, USA and USSR (a transport squadron). Between its inception and May 1945 the BAF flew 38,340 sorties, dropped 6,650 tons of bombs, delivered 16,440 tons of supplies and flew 2,500 individuals into Yugoslavia and 19,000 (mostly wounded) out.

Towards the end of its existence, it operated a small number of units from Yugoslav soil to harass the retreating Germans. However, disagreements with Tito (particularly the arrest of members of the Special Boat Squadron on 13 April 1945, although they were quickly released) meant that all British ground forces were withdrawn, although BAF aircraft operating from Zadar continued to support the Partisan offensive. Between 19 March and 3 May they flew 2,727 sorties, attacking the German withdrawal route from Sarajevo to Zagreb and supporting the Fourth Yugoslav Army advancing from Bihać to Rijeka.

The Balkan Air Force was disbanded on 15 July 1945. During its short existence, it was commanded by (British) Royal Air Force Air Vice Marshals William Elliot and George Mills.

==Operations==
William Deakin, who had met up with the Partisans in May as a representative of Middle East GHQ, was attached as advisor to the newly formed Balkan Air Force, under (then) Air Vice Marshal Elliott, with headquarters at Bari, Italy. This body assumed responsibility for all operations by land, sea, and air into Central and South-Eastern Europe.

Fitzroy Maclean the head of the British military mission to the Partisans said that, as the Balkan Air Force was also responsible for the &quot;planning and co-ordination of all supply dropping&quot; to the Partisans, it &quot;gave me a single authority with whom I could deal direct and was of incalculable advantage in obtaining quick results&quot;. This was decisive in enabling the Partisans to withstand the Raid on Drvar (Seventh Offensive).

Much of the planning for Operation Ratweek to impede the German withdrawal from the Balkans was done at BAF Headquarters and Maclean’s own Rear Headquarters at Bari. Ratweek, started on 1 September 1944, also involved the Navy and the Partisans. USAAF Flying Fortresses (50) were called in to bomb Leskovac and impede the German withdrawal, though with many civilian casualties.

The Balkan Air Terminal Service (BATS) was formed by the BAF to improve the supply of materiel to the Partisans. Teams of the BATS parachuted into Yugoslavia to meet up with the Partisans. Together they then set up a number of landing strips which transport aircraft could land at. Through these concealed airstrips, more supplies could be delivered to the Partisans and wounded Partisans could be flown out for treatment, as well as the delivery and removal of British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) teams.

== Units of the Air Force ==
* 13th Light Bomber Squadron RHAF

* No. 334 Wing RAF
** No. 267 Squadron RAF, as well as operations in the Balkans 267 Squadron could reach Poland and flew operations to deliver and collect agents.
** 60th Troop Carrier Group – Dakota

From June 1944, a Soviet unit of 12 Dakotas and 12 Yakovlev fighters to support the USSR military mission to the Partisans and drop supplies came under the BAF.

At the same time, the BAF coordinated operations in the Adriatic area by Land Forces, Adriatic and the naval forces under the command of the Flag Officer, Taranto.

<doc id="463617" wikidata="Q718636" url="?curid=463617" title="Lantern Festival">
<text>The Lantern Festival (), also called Shangyuan Festival () and Cap Go Meh (), is a Chinese traditional festival celebrated on the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunisolar Chinese calendar, during the full moon. Usually falling in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar, it marks the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations. As early as the Western Han dynasty (206 BC–AD 25), it had become a festival with great significance.

During the Lantern Festival, children go out at night carrying paper lanterns and solving riddles written on them (). In ancient times, lanterns were fairly simple, and only the emperor and noblemen had large, ornate ones. In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with intricate designs. For example, lanterns are now often made in the shape of animals. The lanterns can symbolize the people letting go of their past selves and getting new ones, which they will let go of the next year. The lanterns are almost always red to symbolize good fortune.

The festival acts as an Uposatha day on the Chinese calendar. It should not be confused with the Mid-Autumn Festival, which is sometimes also known as the &quot;Lantern Festival&quot; in locations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Lantern Festivals have also become popular in Western countries, such as the Water Lantern Festival held in multiple locations in the United States.

==Origin ==
There are several beliefs about the origin of the Lantern Festival. However, its roots trace back more than 2,000 years and is popularly linked to the reign of Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty. Emperor Ming, an advocate of Buddhism, noticed Buddhist monks would light lanterns in temples on the fifteenth day of the first lunisolar month. As a result, he ordered all households, temples and the imperial palace to light lanterns on that evening. From there it developed into a folk custom. Another likely origin is the celebration of &quot;the declining darkness of winter&quot; and community&#x27;s ability to &quot;move about at night with human-made light,&quot; namely, lanterns. During the Han dynasty, the festival was connected to Ti Yin, the deity of the North Star.

There is one legend that states that it was a time to worship Taiyi, the God of Heaven in ancient times. The belief was that Taiyi controlled the destiny of the human world. He had sixteen dragons at his beck and call and he decided when to inflict drought, storms, famine or pestilence upon human beings. Beginning with Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, all the emperors ordered splendid ceremonies each year. The emperor would ask Taiyi to bring favorable weather and good health to him and his people.

Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty directed special attention to this event. In 104 BC, he proclaimed it to be one of the most important celebrations and the ceremony would last throughout the night.

Another legend associates the Lantern Festival with Taoism. Tianguan is the Taoist deity responsible for good fortune. His birthday falls on the fifteenth day of the first lunisolar month. It is said that Tianguan likes all types of entertainment, so followers prepare various kinds of activities during which they pray for good fortune.

Another legend associates with the Lantern Festival with an ancient warrior named Lan Moon, who led a rebellion against the tyrannical king in ancient China. He was killed in the storming of the city and the successful rebels commemorated the festival in his name.

Yet another common legend dealing with the origins of the Lantern Festival speaks of a beautiful crane that flew down to earth from heaven. After it landed on earth it was hunted and killed by some villagers. This angered the Jade Emperor in heaven because the crane was his favorite. So, he planned a storm of fire to destroy the village on the fifteenth lunisolar day. The Jade Emperor&#x27;s daughter warned the inhabitants of her father&#x27;s plan to destroy their village. The village was in turmoil because nobody knew how they could escape their imminent destruction. However, a wise man from another village suggested that every family should hang red lanterns around their houses, set up bonfires on the streets, and explode firecrackers on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth lunisolar days. This would give the village the appearance of being on fire to the Jade Emperor. On the fifteenth lunisolar day, troops sent down from heaven whose mission was to destroy the village saw that the village was already ablaze, and returned to heaven to report to the Jade Emperor. Satisfied, the Jade Emperor decided not to burn down the village. From that day on, people celebrate the anniversary on the fifteenth lunisolar day every year by carrying lanterns on the streets and exploding firecrackers and fireworks.

Another legend about the origins of Lantern Festival involves a maid named Yuan-Xiao. In the Han dynasty, Dongfang Shuo was a favorite adviser of the emperor. One winter day, he went to the garden and heard a little girl crying and getting ready to jump into a well to commit suicide. Shuo stopped her and asked why. She said she was Yuan-Xiao, a maid in the emperor&#x27;s palace and that she never had a chance to see her family since she started working there. If she could not have the chance to show her filial piety in this life, she would rather die. Shuo promised to find a way to reunite her with her family. Shuo left the palace and set up a fortune-telling stall on the street. Due to his reputation, many people asked for their fortunes to be told but everyone got the same prediction – a calamitous fire on the fifteenth lunisolar day. The rumor spread quickly.

Everyone was worried about the future so they asked Dongfang Shuo for help. Dongfang Shuo said that on the thirteenth lunisolar day, the God of Fire would send a fairy in red riding a black horse to burn down the city. When people saw the fairy they should ask for her mercy. On that day, Yuan-Xiao pretended to be the red fairy. When people asked for her help, she said that she had a copy of a decree from the God of Fire that should be taken to the emperor. After she left, people went to the palace to show the emperor the decree which stated that the capital city would burn down on the fifteenth. When the emperor asked Dongfang Shuo for advice, the latter said that the God of Fire liked to eat &quot;tangyuan&quot; (sweet dumplings). Yuan-Xiao should cook &quot;tangyuan&quot; on the fifteenth lunisolar day and the emperor should order every house to prepare &quot;tangyuan&quot; to worship the God of Fire at the same time. Also, every house in the city should hang red lantern and explode fire crackers. Lastly, everyone in the palace and people outside the city should carry their lanterns on the street to watch the lantern decorations and fireworks. The Jade Emperor would be deceived and everyone would avoid the disastrous fire.

The emperor happily followed the plan. Lanterns were everywhere in the capital city on the night of the fifteenth lunisolar day and people were walking on the street and there were noisy firecrackers. It looked as if the entire city was on fire. Yuan-Xiao&#x27;s parents went into the palace to watch the lantern decorations and were reunited with their daughter. The emperor decreed that people should do the same thing every year. Since Yuan-Xiao cooked the best &quot;tangyuan&quot;, people called the day Yuan-Xiao Festival.

For each festival celebrated, a switch in the Chinese Zodiac takes place. For example, 2022—the year of the tiger; 2023—the year of the rabbit (water rabbit); and so on.

== Tradition ==

===Finding love===

In the early days, young people were chaperoned in the streets in hopes of finding love. Matchmakers acted busily in hopes of pairing couples. The brightest lanterns were symbolic of good luck and hope. As time has passed, the festival no longer has such implications in most of Mainland China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong.

In Malaysia, some unmarried women write their names and contact details on mandarin oranges. The oranges are then thrown into lakes or rivers in the hope that they are retrieved by a potential suitor.

===Tangyuan or Yuanxiao===

Eaten during the Lantern Festival, tangyuan &#x27;湯圓&#x27; (Southern China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia) or yuanxiao &#x27;元宵&#x27; (Northern China) is a glutinous rice ball typically filled with sweet red bean paste, sesame paste, or peanut butter. Tangyuan is different from yuanxiao due to different manual making and filling processes. However, they are very similar in shape and taste, so most people do not distinguish them for convenience and consider them as the same thing. Chinese people believe that the round shape of the balls and the bowls in which they are served symbolize family togetherness, and that eating tangyuan or yuanxiao may bring the family harmony, happiness and luck in the new year.

===6th century and afterwards===

During the Sui dynasty in the sixth century, Emperor Yang invited envoys from other countries to China to see the colourful lighted lanterns and enjoy the gala performances.

By the beginning of the Tang dynasty in the seventh century, the lantern displays would last three days. The emperor also lifted the curfew, allowing the people to enjoy the festive lanterns day and night. It is not difficult to find Chinese poems which describe this happy scene.

In the Song dynasty, the festival was celebrated for five days and the activities began to spread to many of the big cities in China.

Today, displaying lanterns remains a major tradition across China on the fifteenth day of the first lunisolar month. Chengdu in southwest China&#x27;s Sichuan Province, for example, holds a lantern fair each year in Culture Park. During the Lantern Festival, the park is a virtual ocean of lanterns. Many new designs attract large numbers of visitors. The most eye-catching lantern is the Dragon Pole. This is a lantern in the shape of a golden dragon, spiraling up a 38-meter-high pole, spewing fireworks from its mouth. Cities such as Hangzhou and Shanghai have adopted electric and neon lanterns, which can often be seen beside their traditional paper or wooden counterparts. Another popular activity at this festival is guessing lantern riddles, a tradition which dates back to the Song dynasty.

===Festivities===

Lion dance (), walking on stilts (), riddle games (), and dragon dances () are very popular activities during the festival day and the days following.

The lantern riddle, according to Japanese scholars, became popular as early as the Northern Song dynasty (960–1126). The lantern riddles are done by a host blocking one side of the lantern and pasting riddles on the remaining three sides of the lanterns. Participants will guess the blocked side by solving the riddles, which is called &quot;breaking/solving lantern riddles&quot;. The theme of riddles can be drawn from classics, biographies, poetry, the various philosophers&#x27; well-known stories and novels, proverbs, (the names of) all kinds of birds, animals, and insects, as well as flowers, grasses, vegetables, and herbs. Participants can tear off the riddle of the lantern and let the host verify their answers. Those who answer the correct answer can get a &quot;riddle reward&quot;, including ink, paper, writing brushes, ink slabs, fans, perfumed sachets, fruit, or eatables.

<doc id="463620" wikidata="Q7208482" url="?curid=463620" title="Poisoned candy myths">
<text>Poisoned candy myths are mostly urban legends about malevolent strangers intentionally hiding poisons, drugs, or sharp objects such as razor blades in candy, which they then distribute with the intent of harming random children, especially during Halloween trick-or-treating. These myths, originating in the United States, serve as modern cautionary tales to children and parents and repeat two themes that are common in urban legends: danger to children and contamination of food.

There have been confirmed cases of poisoned candy but these are rare. No cases of strangers killing children this way have been proven.

Commonly, the story appears in the media when a young child dies suddenly after Halloween. Medical investigations into the actual cause of death have always shown that these children did not die from eating candy given to them by strangers. However, in rare cases, adult family members have spread this story to cover up filicide or accidental deaths. In other incidents, a child who has been told about poisoned candy places a dangerous object or substance in a pile of candy and pretends that it was the work of a stranger. This behavior is called the &quot;copycat effect&quot;. Folklorists, scholars, and law enforcement experts say that the story that strangers put poison into candy and give that candy to trick-or-treating children has been &quot;thoroughly debunked&quot;.

Worries that candy from strangers might be poisoned have led to the rise of alternative events to trick-or-treating, such as events held at Christian churches, police and fire stations, community centers, and retail stores. The primary risk to children&#x27;s health and safety on Halloween is being killed by a car.

==History of the myth==

Claims that candy was poisoned or adulterated gained general credence during the Industrial Revolution, when food production moved out of the home or local area, where it was made in familiar ways by known and trusted people, to strangers using unknown ingredients and unfamiliar machines and processes. Some doctors publicly claimed that they were treating children poisoned by candy every day. If a child became ill and had eaten candy, the candy was widely assumed to be the cause. However, no cases of illness or death were ever substantiated.

In the 1890s and 1900s, the US Bureau of Chemistry, in conjunction with state agencies, tested hundreds of kinds of candy and found no evidence of poisons or adulteration. These tests revealed that inexpensive glucose (from corn syrup) was in common use for cheap candies, that some candies contained trace amounts of copper from uncoated copper cooking pans, and that coal tar dyes were being used for coloring, but there was no evidence of the many types of poison, industrial waste, garbage, or other adulterants alleged to be present. Eventually, the claims that children were being sickened by candy were put down to indigestion due to overeating, or to other causes, including food poisoning due to improper cooking, hygiene, or storage of meat and other foods.

=== Social causes ===
The prevalence and persistence of these myths during the 1960s and 1970s, a time of social upheaval, greater racial integration, and improved status for women, reflected societal questions about who was trustworthy. Because society was struggling with questions about whether to trust neighbors in newly integrated neighborhoods, or young women who were publicly rejecting the subservient, motherhood-focused roles previously assigned to women, these stories about unidentifiable neighbors allegedly harming random, innocent children during an event intended to bring happiness to these children caught and retained the public imagination in a way that accurate stories about a judgmental neighbor, an abusive parent, or an adult carelessly leaving harmful chemicals where children can reach them, would not have. An academic view sees this as an example of a rumor panic, with Halloween developing as a carnival-like folk institution – meant to release social tensions – losing its functionality as neighborhoods themselves break down (for various reasons).

=== Effects ===

Due to their fears, parents and communities restricted trick-or-treating and developed alternative &quot;safe&quot; events, such as trunk-or-treat events held at Christian churches. This collective fear also served as the impetus for the &quot;safe&quot; trick-or-treating offered by many local malls.

This story also promoted the sale of individually wrapped, brand-name candies and discouraged people from giving homemade treats to children.

The myth may also distract parents from the primary safety risk on Halloween, which is children being killed by cars. In the US, young children ages 4 to 8 are ten times as likely to be killed by a car on Halloween than on any other day of the year. Children of all ages (age 0 to 17) are three times as likely to be killed by a vehicle on Halloween than during the rest of the year.

== Candy-tampering myth ==
=== Development of the modern candy-tampering myth ===
Several events in the late 20th century fostered the modern-day candy tampering myth.

In 1959, a California dentist, William Shyne, gave candy-coated laxative pills to trick-or-treaters. He was charged with outrage of public decency and unlawful dispensing of drugs.

In 1964, a disgruntled Long Island, New York woman gave out packages of inedible objects to children who she believed were too old to be trick-or-treating. The packages contained items such as steel wool, dog biscuits, and ant buttons (which were clearly labeled with the word &quot;poison&quot;). Though nobody was injured, she was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to endangering children. The same year saw media reports of lye-filled bubble gum being handed out in Detroit and rat poison being given in Philadelphia, although these reports were never substantiated to be actual events.

Another notable milestone in the spread of the candy tampering myths was an article published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1970. This article claimed that &quot;Those Halloween goodies that children collect this weekend on their rounds of &#x27;trick or treating&#x27; may bring them more horror than happiness&quot; and provided specific examples of potential tampering.

Reports and copycat incidents peaked shortly after the Chicago Tylenol murders, which were first reported one month before Halloween and continued into October 1982, further contributing to the myth of candy tampering. The Chicago Tylenol murders involved an unidentified murderer who tampered with and added poison to a few bottles of over-the-counter medication after the medication had been delivered to stores, resulting in the deaths of several people who then ingested the medication.
=== Debunking the myths ===
Joel Best, a sociologist at the University of Delaware, specializes in the scholarly study of candy-tampering legends. He collected newspaper reports from 1958 to 1983 in search of evidence of candy tampering. Fewer than 90 instances might have qualified as actual candy tampering. In none of the cases does he attribute the events to &quot;random attempts to harm children&quot; during the Halloween holiday. Instead, most cases were attempts by adults to gain financial compensation or, far more commonly, by children to get attention. Best found five child deaths that were initially thought by local authorities to be caused by homicidal strangers, but none of those were sustained by investigation.

Fabrications by children are particularly common. Children sometimes copy or act out the stories about tampered candy that they overhear, by adding pins to or pouring household cleaners on their candy and then reporting the now-unsafe candy to their parents. In these incidents, the children have not been harmed; they know that the dangerous item is present and that it would be unsafe to eat the candy.

Far more prevalent during the same period were reports of vandalism, racist incidents, or children being injured in pedestrian–vehicle collisions on Halloween.

=== Misattributed deaths ===
The deaths of five children were initially blamed on stranger poisoning. A key quality of the poisoned candy myths is that the poisoner is a stranger who is indiscriminately murdering children, rather than dying from an unrelated medical condition or being poisoned by a family member. All of these claims were proven false upon investigation; none of them were poisonings by strangers.
* Accidental death: In 1970, Kevin Toston, a five-year-old boy from the Detroit area, died after finding and eating his uncle&#x27;s heroin. The family attempted to protect the uncle by claiming the drug had been sprinkled in the child&#x27;s Halloween candy.
* Murdered by father: In a 1974 case, an 8-year-old boy in Deer Park, Texas, died after eating a cyanide-laced package of Pixy Stix that his father had planted in his trick-or-treat pile. The father, Ronald Clark O&#x27;Bryan, also gave out poisoned candy to other children in an attempt to cover up the murder, though no other children consumed the poisoned treats. The murderer, who had wanted to claim life insurance money, was executed in 1984. Because the poisoned candy myth describes random or indiscriminate murders by strangers, rather than murder of a son by his own father, this is not technically an example of a poisoned candy myth.
* Natural death unrelated to candy: In 1978, Patrick Wiederhold, a two-year-old boy from Flint, Michigan, died after eating Halloween candy. However, toxicology tests found no evidence of poison, and his death was determined to be due to natural causes.
* Natural death due to pre-existing medical condition: In 1990, Ariel Katz, a seven-year-old girl in Santa Monica, California, died while trick-or-treating. Early press reports blamed poisoned candy, despite her parents telling the police that she had previously been diagnosed with a serious medical condition, an enlarged heart, which was the actual cause of death.
* Natural death due to infection: In 2001, a four-year-old girl in Vancouver, British Columbia, died after eating some Halloween candy. However, there was no evidence of poisoned candy, and she died of a streptococcus infection.

=== Media and the myth ===
Despite these claims of poisoned candy being eventually proved false, the news media promoted the story continuously throughout the 1980s, with local news stations featuring frequent coverage. During this time cases of poisoning were repeatedly reported based on unsubstantiated claims or before a full investigation could be completed and often never followed up on. This one-sided coverage contributed to the overall panic and caused rival media outlets to issue reports of candy tampering as well. However, Joel Best says that the spread of the myth cannot be blamed solely on the media and that it must have been transmitted via word of mouth as well.

By 1985, the media had driven the hysteria about candy poisonings to such a point that an ABC News/&quot;Washington Post&quot; poll that found 60% of parents feared that their children would be injured or killed because of Halloween candy sabotage.

Advice columnists entered the fray during the 1980s and 1990s with both &quot;Ask Ann Landers&quot; and &quot;Dear Abby&quot; warning parents of the horrors of candy tampering:

== Candy tampering by friends and family ==
Almost all tampering cases—at a rate of one or two per year—involve a friend or family member, usually as a prank. Almost all of those involved sharp objects, rather than poisoning. Three-quarters of them resulted in no injuries, and the rest resulted in only minor injuries. No child has ever been killed by eating a Halloween candy from a stranger.
== Confirmed case of non-fatal candy tampering ==
In 2000, in Minneapolis, a mentally ill man put needles in candy bars and gave them to trick-or-treaters. One teenager received a minor injury.

<text>A cricket pitch is the rectangular central strip of a cricket field between the two wickets, where most of the action takes place. It is long (1 chain) and wide. The surface is flat and is normally covered with extremely short grass, but can be completely dry or dusty soil with barely any grass or, in some circumstances (that are rarely seen in high level cricket), made from an artificial material. Over the course of a cricket match, the pitch is not repaired or altered other than in special circumstances - meaning that it will change condition. Any grass on the pitch at the start of the game, for example, may disappear due to wear.

As almost all deliveries bowled will bounce off the pitch towards the batter, the state and type of a cricket pitch can significantly affect the outcome of a match. For example, a dusty, very dry, pitch will favour spin bowling because the ball will grip more on a dusty pitch - giving the team with the superior spin bowlers a significant advantage in the match. The state of the pitch is so important to the outcome of a cricket match that home teams can be fined or docked points if they produce a poor pitch that is deemed unfit for normal play, or seen to be a danger to batters by the ball behaving erratically when pitching on it. Players can face disciplinary action if they are seen to be deliberately damaging or altering the pitch in ways that are not allowed by the Laws of Cricket. Because of this, coaches, players, commentators and pundits will make much of how the pitch is &quot;behaving&quot; during a cricket match, especially during a first class or a Test match that takes place over several days, wherein the condition of the pitch can change significantly over that period. These conditions will impact on the decision at the coin toss at the beginning of the game, as to whether batting first or bowling first is more advantageous. For example, a captain will prefer to bat first if the pitch is &quot;flat&quot; and presumably easier to bat on, but may be tempted to bowl first on a greener, more moist pitch that favours movement of the ball early.

In amateur matches in some parts of the world, artificial pitches are sometimes used. These can be a slab of concrete overlaid with a coir mat or artificial turf. Sometimes dirt is put over the coir mat to provide an authentic feeling pitch. Artificial pitches are rare in professional cricket, being used only when exhibition matches are played in regions where cricket is not a common sport.

The pitch has specific markings delineating the creases, as specified by the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;.

The word &quot;wicket&quot; often occurs in reference to the pitch. Although technically incorrect according to the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; (Law 6 covers the pitch and Law 8 the wickets, distinguishing between them), cricket players, followers, and commentators persist in the usage, with context eliminating any possible ambiguity. &quot;Track&quot; or &quot;deck&quot; are other synonyms for pitch.

The rectangular central area of the cricket field – the space used for pitches – is known as the &quot;square&quot;. Cricket pitches are usually oriented as close to the north–south direction as practical, because the low afternoon sun would be dangerous for a batter facing due west.

== Uses of the pitch ==
The pitch has one popping crease at each of its ends, with these dividing the field into the two batter&#x27;s grounds, and the area in between (including the creases) in which the ball must be bowled and the batsmen run. 
* Bowling: Bowlers can bowl the ball by throwing it and making it bounce on the ground of the pitch. The return creases, which follow almost directly from the edges of the pitch down the field, restrict the angle the bowler may bowl from. 
* Batting: Batters may occasionally move around the pitch (particularly their crease in an effort to make contact with the ball). They may also make small marks on the pitch to indicate where they will stand, and while batting, they sometimes swing the bat in such a way that it hits some of the dirt in the pitch in the air.
* Running: The two batters may run along the sides of the pitch, between the batter&#x27;s grounds, to score runs.
* Fielding: Occasionally fielders (often the bowler) may run on the pitch to run out a batter.
* Practice Session: Before a live cricket match, players have practice sessions with their official coach. They cannot use the main pitch, but are allowed to check the surface of the original pitch where the match will be played.
At any given moment, one end of the pitch will be the striker&#x27;s end, while the other end is the non-striker&#x27;s end. After each over, the ends swap. During the game, the bowler bowls from the nonstriker&#x27;s end to the striker at the other end.

==Protected area==

The protected area or danger area is the central portion of the pitch – a rectangle running down the middle of the pitch, two feet wide, and beginning five feet from each popping crease. Under the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;, a bowler must avoid running on this area during their follow-through after delivering the ball.

The pitch is protected to preserve fairness in the game; the ball normally bounces on the pitch within this region, and if it is scuffed or damaged by the bowler&#x27;s footmarks it can give an unfair advantage to the bowling side. These areas can be exploited by the bowlers to change the outcome of the match. If a bowler runs on the protected area, an umpire will issue a warning to the bowler and to their team captain. The umpire issues a second and final warning if the bowler transgresses again. On the third offence, the umpire will eject the bowler from the attack and the bowler may not bowl again for the remainder of the innings. The rule does not prevent the bowler or any other fielder from running on the protected area in an effort to field the ball; it applies only to the uninterrupted follow-through.

==State of the pitch==
A natural pitch with grass longer or more moist than usual is described as a &quot;green pitch&quot;, &quot;green top&quot;, or &quot;green seamer&quot;. This favours the bowler over the batter as the ball can be made to behave erratically on longer or wet grass. Most club and social cricket is played on pitches that professional cricketers would call green.

A sticky wicket – a pitch that has become wet and is subsequently drying out, often rapidly in hot sun – causes the ball to behave erratically, particularly for the slower or spin bowlers. However, modern pitches are generally protected from rain and dew before and during games so a sticky pitch is rarely seen in first-class cricket. The phrase, however, has retained currency and extended beyond cricket to mean any difficult situation.

As a match progresses, the pitch dries out. The &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; bar watering the pitch during a match. As it dries out, initially batting becomes easier as any moisture disappears. Over the course of a four or five-day match, however, the pitch begins to crack, then crumble and become dusty. This kind of pitch is colloquially known as a &#x27;dust bowl&#x27; or &#x27;minefield&#x27;. This again favours bowlers, particularly spin bowlers who can obtain large amounts of traction on the surface and make the ball spin a long way. The relative deterioration and spin-friendliness of a pitch are often referred to by mentioning the number of days it has (or appears to have been) played on. A pitch which produces prodigious turn is referred to as a &quot;Turner.&quot; When it produces a great deal of spin, it can be called a &quot;square&quot;, &quot;raging&quot;, or &quot;rank&quot; turner.

This change in the relative difficulties of batting and bowling as the state of the pitch changes during a match is one of the primary strategic considerations that the captain of the team that wins the coin toss will take into account when deciding which team will bat first and can accordingly finalise his decisions.

===Pitch condition===
Pitches in different parts of the world have different characteristics. The nature of the pitch plays an important role in the actual game: it may have a significant influence on team selection and other aspects. Pitches in hot and dry climates or seasons tend to have less grass on them, making batting easier. Batters or bowlers can have different levels of success based on the region they are in, and this is partially due to variation in pitches. As the pitch deteriorates throughout a match, this can also have considerable influence on the success or failure of a team&#x27;s bowling or batting efforts.

===Pitch safety===
Certain conditions, as set out by the ICC, must be met to ensure that a pitch is fit and safe to play on. If the pitch is found to excessively favour one side, or if other conditions cause it to be dangerous, the match may, after agreement between the captains and the umpires, be abandoned and possibly rescheduled.

==Preparation and maintenance of the playing area==

Law 9 of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; sets out rules covering the preparation and maintenance of the playing area.

===Uncovered pitches===
Cricket was initially played on uncovered pitches. Uncovered pitches began to be phased out in the 1960s.

====Covering the pitch====
The pitch is said to be covered when the groundskeepers have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The use or non-use of covers significantly affects the way the ball comes off the pitch, making the matter potentially controversial. Law 11 of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot; provides that during the match the pitch shall not be completely covered unless provided otherwise by regulations or by agreement before the toss. When possible, the bowlers&#x27; run ups are covered in inclement weather to keep them dry. If the pitch is covered overnight, the covers are removed in the morning at the earliest possible moment on each day that play is expected to take place. If covers are used during the day as protection from inclement weather or if inclement weather delays the removal of overnight covers, they are removed as soon as conditions allow. Excess water can be removed from a pitch or the outfield using a machine called a water hog.

===Rolling the pitch===
During the match, the captain of the batting side may request the rolling of the pitch for a period of not more than 7 minutes before the start of each innings (other than the first innings of the match) and before the start of each subsequent day&#x27;s play. In addition, if, after the toss and before the first innings of the match, the start is delayed, the captain of the batting side may request to have the pitch rolled for not more than 7 minutes, unless the umpires together agree that the delay has had no significant effect on the state of the pitch. Once the game has begun, rolling may not take place other than in these circumstances.

If there is more than one roller available, the captain of the batting side shall have the choice. Detailed rules exist to make sure that, where possible, rolling takes place without delaying the game but the game is delayed if necessary to allow the batting captain to have up to 7 minutes rolling if they so wish. Rolling the pitch can take a long time but will be very effective once done. Rolling of the pitch is crucial to whether it is better for a batter or a bowler.

For the 2010 County Championship season, the heavy roller was banned from use during a County Championship match. The belief was that the heavy roller was helping to make pitches flat, and therefore producing too many drawn games.

===Sweeping===
Before a pitch is rolled it is first swept to avoid any possible damage caused by rolling in debris. The pitch is also cleared of any debris at all intervals for meals, between innings and at the beginning of each day. The only exception to this is that the umpires do not allow sweeping to take place where they consider it may be detrimental to the surface of the pitch.

===Mowing===
Groundskeepers mow the pitch on each day of a match on which play is expected to take place. Once a game has begun, mowings take place under the supervision of the umpires.

===Footholes and footholds===
The umpires are required to make sure that bowlers&#x27; and batter&#x27;s footholes are cleaned out and dried whenever necessary to facilitate play. In matches of more than one day&#x27;s duration, if necessary, the footholes made by the bowler in his delivery stride may be returfed or covered with quick-setting fillings to make them safe and secure. Players may also secure their footholes using sawdust provided that the pitch is not damaged or they do not do so in a way that is unfair to the other team.

===Research===
England is the hub for considerable research in the preparation of cricket pitches, with Cranfield University working with the ECB and The Institute of Groundsmanship (IOG).

==Practising on the field==
The rules do not allow players to practise bowling or batting on the pitch, or on the area parallel and immediately adjacent to the pitch, at any time on any day of the match. Practice on a day of a match on any other part of the cricket square may take place only before the start of play or after the close of play on that day and must cease 30 minutes before the scheduled start of play or if detrimental to the surface of the square.

Typically players do practise on the field of play, but not on the cricket square, during the game. Also bowlers sometimes practise run ups during the game. However, no practice or trial run-up is permitted on the field of play during play if it could result in a waste of time. The rules concerning practice on the field are covered principally by Law 26 of the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;.

==Typical pitches==
Pitches in different parts of the world have different characteristics. The nature of the pitch plays an important role in the actual game: it may have a significant influence on team selection and other aspects. A spin bowler may be preferred in the Indian subcontinent where the dry pitches assist spinners (especially towards the end of a five-day test match) whereas an all pace attack may be used in places like Australia where the pitches are bouncy.

The nature of a pitch is determined more by the climatic and geographic conditions of that country. A few alterations could be done on the pitch such as weeding,watering and surfacing. However, it cannot completely change the characteristics of a pitch. And the nature of typical pitches prepared in a country seems to have an impact on the role played by the majority of the quality players it produces.

===Pitches in England and Wales===
Green, swing promoting and humid conditions sums up the construction of English pitches with a lot depending on the weather. Early in the season, most batsmen have to be on their guard as English pitches prove to be most fickle, like the country&#x27;s weather. Later in the summer, the pitches tend to get harder and lose their green which makes the task easier for batsmen. Spinners prove less effective in the first half of the season and tend to play their part only in the second half. The dry and hot conditions and little dust makes the grounds ideal place to practise reverse swing with a 50-over old ball. England has mostly produced a lot of quality seam bowlers like Bob Willis, Ian Botham, James Anderson and many more who love to bowl in the good length areas of the pitch, since the pitches at their home ground supports a lot of lateral movement though it does not provide adequate bounce.

===Pitches in Australia===
Pitches in Australia have traditionally been known to be good for fast bowlers because of the amount of bounce that can be generated on these surfaces. The bounce is mainly generated because of the hardness of the pitches caused by the hot Australian summers and adequate moisture to reduce the cracks. In particular, the pitch at the WACA Ground in Perth is regarded as being possibly the quickest pitch in the world. The Gabba in Brisbane is also known to assist fast bowlers with its bounce. However, these kinds of bouncy pitches also open up more areas for run-scoring, as they promote the playing of a lot of pull, hook and cut shots. Batsmen who play these shots will have a lot of success on these pitches.

Other stadiums like Adelaide Oval and Sydney Cricket Ground have been known to assist spinners more as these pitches have more dust cover. This makes the stadiums an attractive ground for batsmen; teams on an average have scores of 300 or above in their first innings. The Melbourne Cricket Ground can assist seam bowlers initially, but it has a tennis-ball bounce which can negate the potency of bowlers once a match progresses.

Swing bowling can be a weapon in Australia, but unlike England, it depends upon the overhead conditions, similar to the Indian subcontinent. Australia has mostly produced a lot of legendary pace bowlers like Brett Lee, Mitchell Johnson, Glenn McGrath who love to bang the ball in short and have mastered the art of swing bowling, which is understood given the nature of their pitch.

===Pitches in India ===
Pitches in India have historically supported spin bowling rather than seam or swing. A ball bowled at pace may not carry well to the keeper taking slip catches out of the equation. Such pitches had virtually no grass, afforded little assistance for pace, bounce, or lateral air movement, but created good turn due to the widened cracks. The main reason for such pitches is the hot and dry weather, which tends to remove the moisture from the pitches. In decades past, legendary spin bowlers – most notably the Indian spin quartet of the 1960s and 1970s, consisting of left-armer Bedi, offspinners Prasanna and Venkataraghavan, and legspinner Chandrasekhar – routinely toyed with visiting teams to plot dramatic victories for India in home test matches, particularly on turning pitches in hot, humid conditions at Eden Gardens in Kolkata (then known as Calcutta) and Chepauk in Chennai (then known as Madras).

They outwitted opposing batsmen not only through line, length, and trajectory variations but also by physically and psychologically exploiting rough spots resulting from wear and tear on the playing top and cracks from increasing surface dryness as a game progressed. The Indian batsmen, being accustomed to these pitch styles, generally relished home conditions. While the Brabourne and Wankhede stadiums in Mumbai and Ferozshah Kotla in Delhi never offered nearly as much turn to spinners.

Indian pitches and attitudes have changed considerably in the past few years though. The induction of several newer &#x27;green top&#x27; venues (such as the ones at Mohali and at Dharamshala which have a cooler climate) provide English-like conditions, which has led to the emergence of Indian fast bowlers like Zaheer Khan, Javagal Srinath, Ashish Nehra, RP Singh and many more in the recent past who have mastered swing bowling and usually bowl at English-like length, which is the good length areas . The development of domestic league cricket with international participants in the form of IPL, Ranji Trophy, ICL, have resulted in a greater variety of pitches. Some contemporary pitches provide good support for pace, bounce, and swing. Surfaces are often tailor made to be flat tops or excessively batsmen-friendly by surfacing the pitch really well, for the sake of maximising entertainment value, at the expense of all types of bowlers. But at time the reverse is true especially in the IPL wherein pace heavy teams often come-up with green pace friendly pitches to maximise chances of victory.

===Pitches in South Africa===
Pitches resemble those in Australia with added swing (lateral) movement and comparatively lesser bounce. However, genuine fast bowlers who can hit the deck hard and hope for some seam as well do the most damage. Spinners gain little assistance, as in New Zealand, and have to toil hard. The reason for these kind of pitches is again the same as that in Australia, that is hot summers with adequate moisture. South Africa is known to produce quality fast bowlers like Dale Steyn, Shaun Pollock, Kagiso Rabada and many more.

===Pitches in New Zealand===
Pitches in New Zealand, like the ones at Eden Park, Auckland and Basin Reserve, Wellington can have a green tinge similar to their counterparts in England. The ball swings a lot due to the proximity of most grounds to the sea, relative humidity and moisture under the surface. New Zealand pitches are often bouncy and quick in nature due to the usual grass cover left on them. The grass cover offers seam movement early on, but also maintains the integrity of the pitch which can often dampen the effect of spin bowling but allows pitches to flatten out over the course of a match. Batting can be trying early on and batsman often take time to adjust to the conditions. New Zealand is known to produce quality fast bowlers like Danny Morrison, Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Sir Richard Hadlee and many more.

===Pitches in the West Indies===
The West Indies tends to produce balanced pitches. Neither is the bounce too disconcerting nor is the movement extravagant. It also does not assist spin like subcontinent pitches and hence for quality batsman they could be batting paradises. However, bowlers who are willing to bend their backs find some assistance from these pitches. Pitches here have earned a reputation of helping the quicks somewhat mainly because of the era gone by when West Indies used to have some of the fastest bowlers in cricket and hence the pitches appeared to be faster than they are. Tall bowlers like Malcolm Marshall, Joel Garner, Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Ian Bishop, Colin Croft, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh produced bounce and speed even on the most docile pitches. However, some of the best batsmen have arisen from the Caribbean too, like Viv Richards, Gary Sobers, Desmond Haynes, George Headley, Clive Lloyd, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Rohan Kanhai, Chris Gayle and Brian Lara. Spinners also have something in the pitches as they tend to deteriorate by day four, offering a little dust and cracks for them to exploit. But due to insufficient support to spin in the Caribbean pitches, West Indies has not produced many all-time great spinners with the exception of Lance Gibbs.

===Pitches in Pakistan===
Pitches in Pakistan have historically supported spin bowling rather than seam or swing. However, the conditions in most grounds of Pakistan, like Rawalpindi, Lahore and Peshawar have also seen support for the reverse swing capabilities of bowlers in past times. The dry and windy conditions usually lend good support to the faster bowlers as well. Such pitches had virtually no grass, afforded little assistance for pace, bounce, or lateral air movement, but created good turn. In decades past spinners toyed with visiting teams to plot dramatic victories for Pakistan in home test matches, particularly on turning pitches in hot, humid conditions at Arbab Niaz Stadium and Gaddafi Stadium. Pitches in Pakistan are flat and considered favourable for batsmen in winter; they suit spinners in summers. Pakistan has produced quality spin bowlers like Shaqlain Mushtaq, Saeed Ajmal, Mushtaq Ahmed as well as pace bowlers who have mastered the art of late swing and reverse swing including the likes of Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram and many more.

===Pitches in Bangladesh===
The Bangladeshi wickets receive a lot of rain fall in little time which reflects the soggy nature. The conditions vary from grounds like Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium. The basic idea of producing wickets in Bangladesh is to avoid using grassroots when they are building up the layers of soil. The roots hold the water and retain moisture for an extended period. It helps bind the wicket better, making it a harder surface eventually. It also slows the process of wearing down.

===Pitches in Sri Lanka===
Pitches are generally dusty and shorn off grass; the rain here also makes for a &quot;sticky wicket&quot;. Wickets are generally flat and don&#x27;t offer much bounce – however, the pitch at Asgiriya Stadium, Kandy offers generous bounce and favours fast bowling. Bowlers get help under the lights. Spin is the key in these conditions, and spinners have fine records on the pitches in Sri Lanka. The heat requires an extreme level of fitness, while sweaty clothing makes it difficult to shine the ball. Apart from off-spin and leg-spin, reverse swing is also an effective tools in such conditions. This could be a good explanation Sri Lanka has produced a lot of quality spin bowlers like Muttiah Muralidharan, Rangana Herath and their likes as well as quality pace bowlers like Chaminda Vaas, Lasith Malinga and many more.

===Pitches in Zimbabwe===
Pitches in Zimbabwe closely resemble those in South Africa with the main difference being in the nature of the bounce. The pitches in South Africa provide fast bounce while the pitches in Zimbabwe tend to have a spongy, tennis ball type of bounce, which makes hitting on the up a risky proposition. Most pitches have slower bounce, hence batting is more favourable in Zimbabwe.

Conditions at the Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo tend to aid batsmen, with spin coming into the game in a big way in the latter stages. The pitch has some grass, though not green enough to leave batsmen anxious. With the temperature touching 28 degrees, the strip is expected to dry out quickly and flatten into a batting beauty. The seamers&#x27; best chance will be with the new ball, and both teams feel keen to make first use of the pitch.

===Pitches in UAE===
The UAE features spin-friendly pitches, which is understood given its hot dry weather. New ball helps the bowlers and bowlers eye reverse swing and spin with the older ball. UAE conditions differ significantly from those of Pakistan due to the Gulf&#x27;s sandy soils. Grounds are not that hard. Dubai Cricket Stadium offers some grass and bounce though dry conditions tend to result in the fourth and fifth days of a Test match being spin friendly. Sheikh Zayed Stadium is batting-friendly, and the cracks come very late into play.

==Drop-in pitches==
A drop-in pitch is a pitch that is prepared away from the ground or venue in which it is used, and &quot;dropped&quot; into place for a match to take place. This allows multi-purpose venues to host other sports and events with more versatility than a dedicated cricket ground would allow. Much like an integral pitch, a quality drop-in pitch takes several years to cultivate, grounds would maintain and utilise each drop-in pitch over multiple seasons, and pitches can deteriorate over many years to the point that they need to be retired.

They were first developed by WACA curator John Maley for use in the World Series Cricket matches, set up in the 1970s by Australian businessman Kerry Packer. Drop-in pitches became necessary for the World Series as they had to play in dual purpose venues operating outside of the cricket establishment. Along with other revolutions during the series including the white ball, floodlights, helmets, and coloured clothing, drop-in pitches were designed to also make games more interesting. They would start off bowler friendly seaming and spinning with uneven bounce for the first two days of a game. After that they became extremely easy for batting meaning high targets were chaseable on the fourth and fifth days, although there would still be something in the pitch for the bowlers.

In 2005, the Brisbane Cricket Ground (the &quot;Gabba&quot;) rejected the use of a drop-in pitch, despite requests from the ground&#x27;s other users, the Brisbane Lions AFL team. Although drop-in pitches are regularly used in the Melbourne Cricket Ground and in New Zealand, Queensland Cricket stated that Brisbane&#x27;s weather and the difference in performance meant they preferred to prepare the ground in the traditional way.

Plans to use drop-in pitches in baseball parks in the United States have met with problems due to strict rules about transporting soil over American state lines. It has been found that the best soil types for drop-in pitches are not located in the same states which have been targeted by cricketing authorities – New York, California and Florida.

==Related usages==
The word &quot;pitch&quot; also refers to the bouncing of the ball, usually on the pitch. In this context, the ball is said to pitch before it reaches the batter. Where the ball pitches can be qualified as &quot;pitched short&quot; (bouncing nearer the bowler), &quot;pitched up&quot; (nearer the batter), or &quot;pitched on a length&quot; (somewhere in between).

Unlike in baseball, the word &quot;pitch&quot; does not refer to the act of propelling the ball towards the batter in cricket. In cricket this is referred to as bowling. This action is also referred to as a&quot; delivery&quot;.

===Other sports===
In baseball, some baseball fields used to have a dirt path between the pitcher&#x27;s mound and the batter&#x27;s box, similar to the pitch.

<text>A tracheid is a long and tapered lignified cell in the xylem of vascular plants. It is a type of conductive cell called a tracheary element. Angiosperms also use another type of conductive cell, called vessel elements, to transport water through the xylem. The main functions of tracheid cells are to transport water and inorganic salts, and to provide structural support for trees. There are often pits on the cell walls of tracheids, which allows for water flow between cells. Tracheids are dead at functional maturity and do not have a protoplast. The wood (softwood) of gymnosperms such as pines and other conifers is mainly composed of tracheids. Tracheids are also the main conductive cells in the primary xylem of ferns.

The tracheid was first named by the German botanist Carl Gustav Sanio in 1863, from the German &quot;Tracheide&quot;.

== Evolution ==
Tracheids were the main conductive cells found in early vascular plants.

In the first 140–150 million years of vascular plant evolution, tracheids were the only type of conductive cells found in fossils of plant xylem tissues. Ancestral tracheids did not contribute significantly to structural support, as can be seen in extant ferns.

The fossil record shows three different types of tracheid cells found in early plants, which were classified as S-type, G-type and P-type. The first two of them were lignified and had pores to facilitate the transportation of water between cells. The P-type tracheid cells had pits similar to extant plant tracheids. Later, more complex pits appeared, such as bordered pits on many tracheids, which allowed plants to transport water between cells while reducing the risk of cavitation and embolisms in the xylem.

As tracheids evolved along with secondary xylem tissues, specialized inter-tracheid pits appeared. Tracheid length and diameter also increased, with tracheid diameter increasing to an average length of 80 μm by the end of the Devonian period.

Tracheids then evolved into the vessel elements and structural fibers that make up angiosperm wood.

<text>&quot;Three Colors&quot; was the national anthem of the Socialist Republic of Romania from 1977 to 1990. On 24 January 1990, after the Romanian Revolution, it was officially replaced by the current anthem . Before 1977, the country&#x27;s national anthem was , whose melody is the same as that of the Albanian national anthem.

The song &quot;Three Colors&quot; is based on a Romanian patriotic song written and composed by Ciprian Porumbescu. The original lyrics twice underwent non-credited revisions in order to reflect the country&#x27;s Communist doctrine, and parallels between past and present glories. This was unlike one of the previous anthems, , a text mentioning Romania&#x27;s brotherhood with the Soviet Union, and praises of the Leninist ideology were consciously not included, emphasising a more national communist character of the state.

The title refers to the national flag of Romania, which is a blue-yellow-red tricolor. It has not undergone major changes. Only the distribution of the colors (in point of proportion and position) was changed to a certain extent, being made equal after the abortive Romanian revolution of 1848. The Romanian principalities were among the many European states during that time that were inspired by the French Revolutionary spirit to make a dimensionally standardized tricolour banner as their national flag.

The song continued to be used as Romania&#x27;s national anthem for around a month after the overthrow of the Socialist Republic, but with Porumbescu&#x27;s original patriotic lyrics.

<text>Jacques Cassini (18 February 1677 – 16 April 1756) was a French astronomer, son of the famous Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini. He was known as Cassini II.

==Biography==
Cassini was born at the Paris Observatory. He was first admitted to Collège Mazarin after brief studies at his home observatory under his father. Later, he was admitted at the age of seventeen to membership of the French Academy of Sciences, he was elected in 1696 a fellow of the Royal Society of London, and became &quot;maître des comptes&quot; in 1706. While in England, he was acquainted with other famous astronomers such as Newton and Halley. Having succeeded to his father&#x27;s position at the observatory in 1712, in 1713 he extended the Paris meridian, measuring the arc of the meridian from Dunkirk to Perpignan, and published the results in a volume entitled &quot;Traité de la grandeur et de la figure de la terre&quot; (1720). His two separate calculations for a degree of meridian arc were 57,097 &quot;toises de Paris&quot; (111.282 km) and 57,061 toises (111.211 km), giving results for Earth&#x27;s radius of 3,271,420 toises (6,375.998 km) and 3,269,297 toises (6,371.860 km), respectively. This work represented Cassini&#x27;s delve into the Earth figure debate. There were two main schools of thought, the Cartesians believed in a prolate spheroid, and the Newtonians in an oblate spheroid. Cassini sided with the Cartesians over the Newtonians, advocating for a prolate spheroid shaped earth. The Cartesians had support, but the Newtonians made separate observations seeming to disagree with the Cartesian idea. Cassini II likely realized that the Newtonian observations were more accurate, and stepped out of the scientific field. He only returned publicly after an attack from Anders Celsius.

For his last few years he took up cartography, working with his son, Cassini de Thury or Cassini III, to create a new French map. This map was known as the Carte de Cassini, and was to be a very accurate map of France.

Jacques Cassini&#x27;s work on the ballistic pendulum has been a topic of controversy among historians of science. While some credit him with developing original work on the topic, others argue that he built upon the ideas of earlier scientists. It is difficult to determine the extent of Cassini&#x27;s original contributions, as the available historical records are vague and incomplete. However, subsequent work on ballistic pendulums by Benjamin Robins (1707–1751), a British mathematician and engineer, suggests that he independently repeated many of the same results. Regardless of the extent of Cassini&#x27;s original contributions, his work on the ballistic pendulum was significant in its time and helped to advance the field of ballistics. The device allowed for the measurement of the velocity of projectiles, which was important for the development of more accurate firearms and artillery.

He also wrote &quot;Eléments d&#x27;astronomie&quot; on proper motion (1740), and published the first tables of the satellites of Saturn in 1716. He died at Thury, near Clermont, France.

The asteroid 24102 Jacquescassini is named after him.

Jacques Cassini married Suzanne Françoise Charpentier de Charmois. Their second son was astronomer César-François Cassini de Thury, who was also known as Cassini III.

<text>Collage novel is used by different writers and readers to describe three different kinds of novel: 1) a form of artist&#x27;s book approaching closely (but preceding) the graphic novel; 2) a literary novel that approaches &quot;collage&quot; metaphorically, juxtaposing different modes of original writing; and 3) a novel that approaches collage literally, incorporating found language and possibly combining other modes of original writing.

In the first category, images are selected from other publications and collaged together following a theme or narrative (not necessarily linear). In the second, different modes of writing written by a single author are blended together into a highly fragmentary narrative; no found language is used. In the third, language is often selected from multiple sources; the text might be composed entirely of found language, with no words of the author&#x27;s own.

==Surrealist collage novels==
While it is unclear who coined the term, the Dadaist and Surrealist Max Ernst is generally credited with inventing the collage novel, employing nineteenth-century engravings cut and pasted together to create new images. His works include &quot;Les Malheurs des immortels&quot; (1922), &quot;La Femme 100 Têtes&quot; (1929), &quot;Rêve d&#x27;une petite fille...&quot; (1930) and &quot;Une Semaine de Bonté&quot; (1933–1934). The text for &quot;Les Malheurs des immortels&quot; was written by Paul Éluard.

Georges Hugnet was the author of the collage novel &quot;Le septième face du dé&quot; (1936).

==Two types of literary collage novel==
The leading theorists of literary collage novels in the 21st century are Jonathan Lethem and David Shields. Two of their essays, Lethem&#x27;s &quot;The Ecstasy of Influence&quot; (2007) and Shields&#x27;s &quot;Reality Hunger&quot; (2010), brought discussions on copyright, originality, and inspiration into the fiction and nonfiction worlds. They also popularized collage as a literary form, but employ the term &quot;collage novel&quot; in drastically different ways. In &quot;The Ecstasy of Influence,&quot; Lethem uses &quot;collage novel&quot; to describe Eduardo Paolozzi&#x27;s &quot;Kex,&quot; a text made entirely out of found language: &quot;cobbled from crime novels and newspaper clippings.&quot; In his chapter in &quot;Reality Hunger&quot; on collage novels, Shields uses the term to describe Renata Adler&#x27;s &quot;Speedboat,&quot; a fragmentary narrative that combines different modes of original writing. In Shields&#x27;s words, &quot;Speedboat&quot; “captivates by its jagged and frenetic changes of pitch and tone and voice.” Adler “confides, reflects, tells a story, aphorizes, undercuts the aphorism, then undercuts that . . . She changes subjects like a brilliant schizophrenic, making irrational sense.” In this way, Shields uses &quot;collage novel&quot; to mean a text that is fragmentary, but does not contain any found language. In other essays, Shields uses &quot;collage&quot; to talk about texts that blend original and found language.

<doc id="463683" wikidata="Q2432265" url="?curid=463683" title="Stump (cricket)">
<text>In cricket, the stumps are the three vertical posts that support the bails and form the wicket. &quot;Stumping&quot; or &quot;being stumped&quot; is a method of dismissing a batsman.

The umpire &quot;calling stumps&quot; means the play is over for the day.

==Part of the wicket==

The stumps are three vertical posts which support two bails. The stumps and bails are usually made of wood, most commonly ash, and together form a wicket at each end of the pitch.

The overall width of each wicket is 9 inches (22.9 cm). Each stump is 28 inches (71.1 cm) tall with maximum and minimum diameters of 1 inches (3.81 cm) and 1 inches (3.49 cm). They have a spike at one end for inserting into the ground, and the other end has a U-shaped &#x27;through groove&#x27; to provide a resting place for the bails. In junior cricket the items have lesser dimensions.

Each stump is referred to by a specific name:
* Off stump is the stump on the off side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman&#x27;s bat).
* Middle stump is the centre stump, the middle of the three stumps.
* Leg stump is the stump on the on side of the wicket (the same side as the batsman&#x27;s legs).

These names are relative to the batsman, so a right-handed batsman&#x27;s leg stump becomes the off stump when a left-handed player is batting.

===Modern innovations===
In modern professional play, the stumps are often branded with a sponsor&#x27;s logo. Although they are too far away from spectators to be seen, such logos are visible on television coverage.

====Stump cam====
For professional matches, often one or more of the stumps is hollow and contains a small television camera. This is aligned vertically, but can view through a small window on the side of the stump via a mirror. The so-called &quot;stump-cam&quot; gives a unique view of play for action replays, particularly when a batsman is bowled.

====LED Bails (light-up stumps)====

A recent innovation are stumps and bails embedded with red LEDs, which flash when they are completely dislodged. Invented by an Australian engineer and trademarked as &quot;LED Bails&quot;, they were designed to aid umpires with both run-out and stumping decisions as well as provide distinctive images to television coverage during day-night matches. LED stumps were first used at the 2014 ICC World T20, and have since become commonplace in major white-ball matches like ODIs or franchise T20 leagues. They have also been used in day/night Test matches.

==Manner of dismissing a batsman==
Stumps are very important in the game of cricket as they determine when the wicket is &quot;put down&quot;. The instant the bails are dislodged from the top of the stumps, the wicket is put down (there are other ways in which a wicket can be put down if the bails have already been removed).

* If the wicket is put down with the ball after it has gone past the batsman during a fair delivery (regardless of whether the ball made contact with the batsman&#x27;s body or bat), they are bowled.
* If a batsman is out of their ground (that is, no part of their body or bat is behind the popping crease, the line in front of the stumps) whilst attempting to take a run, they are run out. 
* If a batsman is out of their ground and the wicket is put down by the wicket-keeper before attempting to take a run, they are stumped. 
* If the wicket is put down by the batsman&#x27;s body, bat (including debris if it has broken) or any part of their clothing before attempting a run, they are hit wicket.

==End of the day&#x27;s play==
Stumps is also used as a term to mean the end of a day&#x27;s play, e.g. &quot;The umpires called stumps&quot; means that the umpires have declared that play is over for the day. At the end of a session, i.e. before lunch or tea, the umpires will remove the bails; at the end of the day&#x27;s play, the umpires will also remove the stumps.

<doc id="463684" wikidata="Q609782" url="?curid=463684" title="Mindless Self Indulgence">
<text>Mindless Self Indulgence (often referred to as MSI) is an American electropunk band formed in New York City in 1997. Their music has a mixed style which includes punk rock, alternative rock, electronica, techno, industrial, hip hop, and breakbeat hardcore.

== History ==
Between 1987 and 1996, Jimmy Urine recorded about 35 songs which varied in musical style, usually settling in an industrial/electronic punk style. These songs were recorded with himself and his brother, Markus Euringer in New York City using rudimentary equipment. Urine and his brother released an album titled &quot;Mindless Self-Indulgence&quot;, featuring Steve, Righ? on &#x27;Bed of Roses&#x27;, which featured songs performed in an industrial style akin to Nine Inch Nails.

In 1997, Urine recorded a cover of Method Man&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Pain&quot; that was made by merging six different styles of the same cover into one song. This became the basis for the Mindless Self Indulgence sound. The band formed soon after when Urine was joined by Steve, Righ? on guitar, Urine&#x27;s brother Markus Euringer on second guitar (replaced by bassist Vanessa Y.T., who was subsequently replaced by bassist Lyn-Z), and Kitty on drums. They have released five albums, four EPs, eight remix albums, one live album, two compilation albums, and one live DVD. Rather than signing traditional record contracts, the band has licensed most of their albums to record labels, retaining ownership of the music.

In summer of 2007, the band toured as part of the Revolution Stage of Projekt Revolution, a music festival hosted by Linkin Park. In January 2009, the band headlined the Kerrang! Relentless Energy Drink tour.

In December 2010, they released a comic titled &quot;Adventures Into Mindless Self Indulgence&quot; about various tour stories and significant moments of the band&#x27;s career. The band released a remastered CD/DVD version of their first full-length album, &quot;Tight&quot;, in 2011, titled &quot;Tighter&quot;. It included bonus tracks and recordings from their early days. On October 25, 2012, the band announced their fifth album via a Kickstarter campaign. &quot;How I Learned to Stop Giving a Shit and Love Mindless Self Indulgence&quot; was released in May 2013, following with the release of singles &quot;It Gets Worse&quot; in December and &quot;Fuck Machine&quot; in January 2014. Later in January 2014, the band announced that they would be taking a hiatus.

On September 18, 2015, Mindless Self Indulgence released &quot;Pink&quot;, a collection of 19 songs recorded between 1990 and 1997 by Urine. The album includes cut-down and remastered versions of songs from the self-titled album, an audio diary recorded by Urine from July 1992, and covers of Depeche Mode&#x27;s &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Girls on Film&quot;.

On August 9, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against James Euringer (Jimmy Urine) in New York Supreme Court with the charge of sexual battery of a minor, who claims that she had a sexual relationship with Euringer for over two years — from January 1997 to June 1999 — starting when she was 15 years old and Euringer was 27. On March 26, 2024, all charges against Euringer were dismissed with prejudice after all parties involved in the suit agreed to a stipulation of dismissal.

On June 20, 2024, the band released &quot;MSI B-Sides Vol. 1&quot; without any prior notice. The album contained songs that had not been previously available on streaming platforms.

<doc id="463687" wikidata="Q819241" url="?curid=463687" title="Wrigley Company">
<text>The Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, known as the Wrigley Company, is an American multinational candy and chewing gum company, based in the Global Innovation Center (GIC) in Goose Island, Chicago, Illinois. 

Wrigley&#x27;s is a subsidiary of Mars Inc., and, along with Mars chocolate bars and other candy products, makes up Mars Wrigley Confectionery. It is the largest manufacturer and marketer of chewing gum in the world.

The company currently sells its products in over 180 countries and districts, operates in over 50 countries, and has 21 production facilities in 14 countries.

== History ==

The company was founded on April 1, 1891, in Chicago, Illinois by William Wrigley Jr. Wrigley&#x27;s gum was traditionally made out of chicle, sourced largely from Central America. In 1952, in response to Decree 900, land reforms attempting to end feudal working conditions for peasant farmers in Guatemala, Wrigley&#x27;s discontinued purchasing chicle from that country.

Wrigley&#x27;s announced the closure of its Santa Cruz, California manufacturing plant in April 1996. The plant had been built in 1955. The 385,000-square-foot manufacturing facility was put on the market in October 1996 for US$11.3 million, or about $30 a square foot.

In 2005, Wrigley purchased Life Savers and Altoids from Kraft Foods for US$1.5 billion. On January 23, 2007, Wrigley signed a purchase agreement to acquire an 80% initial interest in Russian chocolatier A. Korkunov for $300 million with the remaining 20% to be acquired over time. On April 28, 2008, Mars, Incorporated announced that it would acquire Wrigley for approximately $23 billion. Financing for the transaction was provided by Berkshire Hathaway, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan; Berkshire Hathaway held a minority equity investment in Wrigley until October 2016, when Mars took full control over the company.

The Wrigley Building on Michigan Avenue, a landmark on Chicago&#x27;s Magnificent Mile, was the company&#x27;s global headquarters until 2011, when it was sold to an investor group that included Zeller Realty Group as well as Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell. The company has been headquartered in the GIC since 2012.

In 2016, Mars announced that Wrigley would be merged with its chocolate segment to form a new subsidiary, Mars Wrigley Confectionery. The new company would maintain global offices in Chicago, while moving its U.S. offices to Hackettstown and Newark, New Jersey.

==Corporate leadership==
===1891–1932: William Wrigley Jr.===

In 1891, 29-year-old William Wrigley Jr. (1861–1932) came to Chicago from Philadelphia with $32 and the idea to start a business selling Wrigley&#x27;s Scouring Soap. Wrigley offered premiums as an incentive to buy his soap, such as baking powder. Later in his career, he switched to the baking powder business, in which he began offering two packages of chewing gum for each purchase of a can of baking powder. The popular premium, chewing gum, began to seem more promising, prompting another switch in product focus. Wrigley also became the majority owner of the Chicago Cubs in 1921.

===1932–1961: Philip K. Wrigley===
After William Wrigley Jr. died, his son Philip K. Wrigley (1894–1977) assumed his father&#x27;s position as CEO of the Wrigley Company. Wrigley is most well known for his unusual move to support US troops and protect the reputation of the Wrigley brand during World War II, in which he dedicated the entire output of Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint, Doublemint, and Juicy Fruit to the US Armed Forces. Wrigley launched the &quot;Remember this Wrapper&quot; ad campaign to keep the Wrigley brands on the minds of the customers during times of wartime rationing. Wrigley&#x27;s P.K. brand was named after P.K. Wrigley.

===1961–1999: William Wrigley III===
In 1961, Philip K. Wrigley handed control to his son, William Wrigley III (1933–1999). Wrigley led a strategic global expansion by establishing Wrigley facilities in nine new countries. On June 26, 1974, a Marsh Supermarket in Troy, Ohio installed the first bar code scanning equipment. The first product to be scanned using a Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code was a 10-pack of Wrigley&#x27;s Juicy Fruit gum. (This pack of gum is now on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Museum of American History.) In 1984, Wrigley introduced a new gum, Extra, which followed the new trend of sugar-free gums in the US. Wrigley also assumed control of the Chicago Cubs after his father&#x27;s death in 1977, and sold the team to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1981.

===1999–2006: William Wrigley IV===
William &quot;Beau&quot; Wrigley IV (1963–), following the death of Wrigley III (his father), led the sugar-free gum campaign across Europe, Australia, Spain, India, and China. In 2005, Kraft Foods sold the Life Savers and Altoids businesses to Wrigley in exchange for $1.5 billion as part of a reorganization plan. Wrigley helped establish the Wrigley Science Institute (WSI) in 2006 to study the oral health benefits of gum chewing. The WSI investigates the effects of gum chewing on weight management, stress relief, concentration, and oral health.

===2006–2008: William Perez===
On October 23, 2006, William D. Perez (1948–) succeeded Bill Wrigley as CEO, becoming the first person outside the Wrigley family to head the company. In 2007, the company debuted 5 Gum in the United States. The 5 Gum brand was marketed using cinematic TV commercials portraying &quot;How it feels to chew 5 Gum.&quot; Perez led the efforts of improving slimmer packaging (Slim Pack) with flavor improvements across both Extra and Wrigley brands.

===2008–2011: Dushan &quot;Duke&quot; Petrovich===
Dushan Petrovich (1954–) succeeded Perez almost immediately after Mars, Incorporated&#x27;s 2008 purchase of Wrigley. In 2009, Wrigley&#x27;s Global Innovation Center received the LEED Gold Certification through Wrigley&#x27;s commitment to global sustainability. In the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wrigley was the Official Confectionery Supplier of the games, in which the company sported Olympic-themed packs and products.

===2011–2017: Martin Radvan===
Martin Radvan became the president of the Wrigley Company after Petrovich. He is responsible for the company&#x27;s worldwide strategy, operations, and business performance.

<doc id="463691" wikidata="Q711092" url="?curid=463691" title="Priscilla Chan (singer)">
<text>Priscilla Chan Wai Han (; born 28 July 1965) is a Hong Kong singer. She is renowned for her contralto singing voice and her maturely clear, technically skilled, and emotion-rich vocals.

Debuted in 1983 at age 18 from a trio album project named &quot;Girls&#x27; Magazine&quot; (少女雜誌), which was formed by Fiori Productions Ltd. (法安利製作有限公司), with the hit &quot;Forgotten Promise&quot; (逝去的諾言), Chan began her solo singing career in 1984 and has since remained popular for more than three decades. Chan signed to PolyGram Records, Hong Kong (寶麗金) in 1986 and reached her career peak between the late-1980s and mid-1990s, and scored several hits particularly in the 1980s, most remarkably including &quot;Silly Girl&quot; (傻女) from her 1988 album &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s Love&quot; (嫻情), as well as her signature song, &quot;Thousands of Songs&quot; (千千闋歌), one of the all-time Cantopop classics, from her 1989 best-selling farewell album &quot;Forever Your Friend&quot; (永遠是你的朋友), which also elevated Chan to the top tier of Hong Kong singers.

Chan continued to release albums during her study, and resumed her full-time singing career in 1995 after graduation, achieving a huge success for her comeback album titled &quot;Welcome Back&quot;. Chan&#x27;s work remained relatively popular throughout the 1990s, eventually falling out of favour in the early 2000s when she was overtaken by a new generation of Cantopop singers. Chan made a few brief comebacks in the 2000s, including the one in 2003 when she signed to Universal Music Hong Kong, performed a concert with two shows, and released an album entitled &quot;Love Knot&quot; (情意結). Feeling frustrated upon poor record sales, Chan stepped back from the Hong Kong musical industry and embarked on her live performances at private functions and concerts overseas and in mainland China, where her popularity was further boosted.

After a decade of hiatus, Chan officially returned to the Hong Kong Cantopop scene in 2013, when she signed to Universal Music Hong Kong again with the relaunch of the PolyGram label in Hong Kong. Chan then successively released two cover albums, namely &quot;By Heart&quot; (2014) and &quot;Evolve&quot; (2015), and the compilation album &quot;Back to Priscilla&quot; (Back to Priscilla 嫻情三十) (2014) commemorating the 30th anniversary since her debut. Chan also performed in two major concert series, namely the &quot;Back to Priscilla: 30th Anniversary Concert 2014 Live&quot; (2014) and the &quot;Priscilla-ism Live 2016&quot; (2016) at the Hong Kong Coliseum, with world tours, live performances, and private functions mainly held in mainland Chinese cities, and sporadically in North America and Russia.

==Early life==
Born in Hong Kong on 28 July 1965, Chan grew up as the eldest of three children (one younger sister and one younger brother). Her parents were senior governmental officials, and her father, Chan Ching-bo (陳澄波), was a former assistant director of Immigration at the Immigration Department of the Government of British Hong Kong, who was interested in music and indirectly developed her interest in singing. Chan attended Marymount Primary School (瑪利曼小學) and Marymount Secondary School (瑪利曼中學) in Happy Valley, Hong Kong, and had once been a secondary school fifth-form classmate with Sandy Lam (林憶蓮), later also a Cantopop and Mandopop singer.

As a teenager, Chan would often take part in extracurricular activities. When Chan was still a primary six student, she already participated in the annual garden party, in celebration of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s birthday, at the Government House held by the Government of British Hong Kong on behalf of the Marymount Primary School, and even shook hands with Sir Murray MacLehose (麥理浩), the then Governor of Hong Kong. Chan entered and received awards in speech contests during the Hong Kong Schools Speech Festival, as well as singing contests and events held internally in her secondary school and externally as joint-school functions, and was eventually got discovered by Angus Mak (麥偉珍, better known as 安格斯), who was an executive for the Fiori Productions Ltd. In 1983, Chan, in her fifth-form at age 18, was invited to audition by Mak and was soon arranged to release a compilation album named &quot;Girls&#x27; Magazine&quot; with Monica Chan Lok-man (陳樂敏) and Luisa Maria Leitão (黎芷珊). At the same time, Chan continued her secondary education and was admitted to the Hong Kong Baptist College in 1985, majoring English studies.

==Career==
===1983–1986: Years in the Fiori Productions Ltd.===
Founders of the Fiori Productions Ltd., including Angus Mak, Jim Lee (李振權), and Tony Chiu (趙潤勤) who later also became Chan&#x27;s manager, worked out the &quot;Girls&#x27; Magazine&quot; album which featured a youthful vibe that suited the young-girl and girl next-door image of the three members. Released in 1984, the debut album was a great success, and particularly the song &quot;Forgotten Promise&quot;, composed as a Cantonese &quot;short tune&quot; (xiaodiao 小調) and sung by Chan, quickly became a hit, earning not only a platinum certification (over 50,000 unit sales) for the album, but also a speedy rise in Chan&#x27;s popularity as a singer. On 30 June and 1 July 1984, the &quot;Girls&#x27; Magazine&quot; group participated in their first public concert entitled &quot;Dragon and Tiger Talents in Concert&quot; (龍虎群英演唱會), at the Hong Kong Coliseum with stars like Anita Mui (梅艷芳), Leslie Cheung (張國榮), Deanie Ip (葉德嫻), Elisa Chan (陳潔靈), and the Tiger Team (小虎隊; William Hu (胡渭康), Suen Ming-kwong (孫明光), and Lam Lei (林利)). Following up the success in record sales and increased popularity, Fiori then arranged Chan&#x27;s debut as a solo artist in August 1984, and released her first solo album titled &quot;&quot;Feelings of a Story&quot; (故事的感覺), also certified platinum, and the song &quot;The Glass Window of Love&quot;&quot; (玻璃窗的愛) was another chart-topping hit. The success of these two albums and two hits finally earned Chan a &quot;Most Promising Newcomer Award&quot; (最有前途新人獎), which was awarded in the 1984 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards (十大中文金曲頒獎音樂會). On 15 to 16 September 1984, Chan co-starred in a youth musical titled &quot;First-love Quintet&quot; (初戀五重奏) with four other female teen idols, namely Sandy Lam, Sandy Lamb (林姍姍), Sara Lee (李麗蕊), and Michelle Pau (鮑翠薇), at the Academic Community Hall (大專會堂) located in the Hong Kong Baptist College. In January 1985, Chan also made her Japanese debut with the release of the extended play &quot;Thousand-Year Lover&quot; (千年戀人; Japanese: ) and another Japanese-Cantonese album of the same title in the name of &quot;Girl&#x27;s Magazine&quot;; Chan even made appearance on Japanese music shows as promotion.

Back in Hong Kong, Chan took part in her first public concert as a solo artist, titled &quot;Teen Idols in Concert&quot; (青年偶像演唱會), at the Hong Kong Coliseum with Jacky Cheung (張學友), David Lui (呂方), Sandy Lam, and Sandy Lamb, on 13 to 14 August 1985. On 6 September 1985, Chan released her self-titled album &quot;&quot;Priscilla&quot; (陳慧嫻). Certified platinum, the album includes the chart-topping hit &quot;Flower Shop&quot; (花店), which its new version was released and included in Chan&#x27;s cover album &quot;By Heart&quot;&quot; in 2014.

===1986–1990: Golden Age in the PolyGram Records Ltd., Hong Kong===
In 1986, as the Fiori Productions Ltd. reorganised, Chan was signed as a full-time contract singer of the PolyGram Records Ltd., Hong Kong, the major music label which was also responsible for the release of Chan&#x27;s aforementioned albums. At the same time, Chan quitted her Bachelor&#x27;s studies at the Hong Kong Baptist College in order to be fully committed to her singing career. On 30 May, the album &quot;&quot;Revolt&quot; (反叛) appeared, which pushed her to new heights by adopting a Japanese-style teens image together with several popular tracks, including the leading track and disco hit &quot;Dancing Street&quot; (跳舞街), a cover version of Angie Gold&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Eat You Up&quot; but based production wise, on Yōko Oginome&#x27;s () version, titled &quot;Dancing Hero (Eat You Up)&quot; (); &quot;Loving and/as Accident&quot; (痴情意外); &quot;Revolt&quot; (反叛); &quot;Hugging with Tears&quot; (與淚抱擁); and &quot;Love Me Once Again&quot;. &quot;Dancing Street&quot;&quot;, in particular, was a huge success that not only topped the charts and was awarded the &quot;Most Popular Disco Song&quot; (Disco 最受歡迎歌曲) at the 1986 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation held by TVB Jade, it is also regarded as one of the pinnacles of Chan&#x27;s career. The album itself was certified double platinum (over 100,000 unit sales), and Chan also officially announced that she would complete her studies abroad after her recording contract signed with PolyGram Records was expired in 1990, a move that bewildered her fans and the industry.

Chan&#x27;s fourth Cantonese studio album, &quot;&quot;Change, Change, Change&quot; (變、變、變) was released on 19 February 1987. Although her attempt to literally change her image into an elegant Audrey Hepburn-like style was failed, such that her hairstyle and outfit were once mocked as resembling to that of Chan Lap-ban (陳立品), the famous Hong Kong supporting actress of the 1950s to 1980s, the image itself remains a classic and the album sales still exceeded triple platinum in record sales with hits like &quot;Greed, Greed, Greed&quot;&quot; (貪、貪、貪) (a cover of Yōko Oginome&#x27;s &quot;Roppongi Junjōha&quot;), &quot;Change, Change, Change Change Change&quot; (變、變、變變變) (a cover of Yū Hayami&#x27;s () &quot;Monday Shutdown&quot;), and &quot;&quot;Go!&quot; (去吧！). On 24 July, Chan&#x27;s first solo compilation album titled &quot;Remix + Best Of&quot; (Remix + 精選) was released.

Chan rebounded nicely in 1988 with the double platinum-certified album &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s Love&quot; (嫻情), released on 15 January 1988, in which the chart-topping hit &quot;Silly Girl&quot; (傻女), a Cantonese rework version of the Spanish song &quot;La Loca&quot; by María Conchita Alonso, confirmed Chan&#x27;s status as a serious contender in the golden age of Cantopop, as the song was awarded both the 1988 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards and 1988 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. The song, selected as one of the 40 greatest Cantopop songs of all time by the Hong Kong edition of Time Out magazine in 2016, is also Chan&#x27;s personal favourite among her own works and the song which Chan thinks best describes herself. Starting from &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s Love&quot; till &quot;Forever Your Friend&quot; (1989), Chan&#x27;s retro-styled stage presence, accompanied by varied, vintage outfits and hatwears also became one of her most iconic images throughout her singing career. Following up the success of &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s Love&quot;, Chan then released a Mandarin-language album &quot;Silly Girl&quot; (傻女) which features &quot;Silly Girl&#x27;s Love&quot; (傻女的愛), the Mandarin version of the song &quot;Silly Girl&quot;.

Another Cantonese album &quot;Autumn Colours&quot; (秋色) appeared on 21 October 1988 and included a number of chart-toppers, such as &quot;Joe le Taxi&quot;, a cover version of the French singer Vanessa Paradis&#x27;s 1987 hit of the same name; &quot;When Will I See You Again?!&quot; (幾時再見?!), a cover version of the American soul group The Three Degrees&#x27;s 1974 song &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;; and &quot;It&#x27;s A Small World&quot;&quot; (人生何處不相逢), a three-week number-one song on the &quot;Ultimate Song Chart&quot; (叱咤樂壇流行榜) of channel Ultimate 903, Commercial Radio Hong Kong (CRHK) that also earned Chan the &quot;Ultimate Female Singer: Silver Award&quot; (叱咤樂壇女歌手銀獎) at the 1988 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation held by CRHK. Together with songs like &quot;&quot;Old Film at Midnight&quot; (凌晨舊戲), and &quot;The Earth Tracking&quot; (地球大追蹤), a cover version of the Guinean singer Mory Kanté&#x27;s &quot;Yé ké yé ké&quot; (1987), &quot;Autumn Colours&quot; was certified 4× platinum in record sales. Noteworthily, &quot;It&#x27;s A Small World&quot; and &quot;When Will I See You Again?!&quot;&quot; are written on the theme of parting, constituting the series of farewell songs for Chan&#x27;s hiatus as she would study abroad at Syracuse University.

1989, the year before Chan moved to New York State to pursue a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Psychology at Syracuse University, was generally recognised as the pinnacle of her career. On 25 July, Chan released her farewell album &quot;&quot;Forever Your Friend&quot; (永遠是你的朋友), with the lead single &quot;Thousands of Songs&quot; (千千闋歌), a melancholic song about a parting couple. Also the Cantonese version of Masahiko Kondō&#x27;s () hit &quot;Song of Sunset&quot; (), &quot;Thousands of Songs&quot;&quot; was a song tailor-made for Chan who was about to suspend her musical career, with Cantonese lyrics written by Richard Lam (林振強). The song became very popular as soon as it was released, not only topping the musical charts of Hong Kong, especially the CRHK&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Song Chart&quot;, on which the song occupied the number-one position for 3 weeks, it was also awarded the 1989 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards, the 1989 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, as well as the &quot;My Favourite Ultimate Song Award&quot; (叱咤樂壇我最喜愛的歌曲大獎) of the year at the 1989 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation, winning with 2,715 votes from the live audience. Together with a series of farewell songs, including &quot;&quot;Night Flight&quot; (夜機), Chan&#x27;s another great hit, the Cantonese version of the German singer Nicole Seibert&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;So Viele Lieder Sind In Mir&quot;, which was also awarded the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards of the same year; and the upbeat dance hit &quot;Dancing Boy&quot;, a Cantonese rework from another Masahiko Kondō&#x27;s song &quot;Dancin&#x27; Babe&quot; (1988), &quot;Forever Your Friend&quot;&quot; garnered enormous success as the album had sold over 350,000 copies (7× platinum) already only in the year 1989, finally becoming the best-selling record of Chan herself and that of the year 1989 in Hong Kong. Besides Chan&#x27;s own popularity and the news of her suspension of career, some critics believe that the wave of mass migrations from Hong Kong in the late 1980s, prompted by events like the signing of the &quot;Sino-British Joint Declaration&quot; in 1984 and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, also contributed the emergence and accelerated popularity of Chan&#x27;s songs like &quot;&quot;It&#x27;s A Small World&quot; and &quot;Thousands of Songs&quot;.

It is worth mentioning that, even though &quot;Thousands of Songs&quot; was more popular, at least in terms of record sales, than &quot;Song of Sunset&quot; (夕陽之歌), the theme song for the 1989 Hong Kong film &quot;A Better Tomorrow III: Love &amp; Death in Saigon&quot; (英雄本色III夕陽之歌) and another Cantopop classic released by Anita Mui in September 1989 in her album &quot;In Brasil&quot; with Cantonese lyrics written by Keith Chan (陳少琪) (lyricist of Chan&#x27;s &quot;Night Flight&quot;), &quot;Thousands of Songs&quot;&quot;, the highly anticipated winner of the year&#x27;s &quot;Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards: Gold Award&quot; (勁歌金曲頒獎典禮金曲金獎) presented by TVB, was lost to its counterpart &quot;Song of Sunset&quot; for the award, due to the closer commercial relations between TVB and Capital Artists (華星唱片), the label to which Mui was signed. Nonetheless, Chan&#x27;s popularity was further promoted because of the album and elevated her to heights alongside peers including Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui; Chan was also awarded the &quot;Ultimate Female Singer: Bronze Award&quot; (叱咤樂壇女歌手銅獎) at the 1989 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation. &quot;&quot;Thousands of Songs&quot;&quot; soon became Chan&#x27;s most important and influential signature song and affirmed her status as a &quot;Cantopop diva&quot;. Additionally, Chan held her first solo concert residency at the Hong Kong Coliseum from 28 August to 2 September 1989, entitled &quot;Priscilla Chan in Concert&quot; (陳慧嫻幾時再見演唱會; lit. Priscilla Chan&#x27;s &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; Concert), one of her most classic performances that also featured the farewell theme, with six shows rapidly sold out.

===1990–1994: Hiatus and years in the US===
On 9 February 1990, Chan left Hong Kong for her study in the US; Michael Au (歐丁玉), her boyfriend and music director at PolyGram at that time, Jacky Cheung, one of her best singer friend since she was signed to PolyGram, her father and her fans saw her off at the Kai Tak Airport, where a large number of media reporters were also present. Chan was officially enrolled as an undergraduate student in August 1990. Although Chan originally planned to stop her musical career after graduation, in fact her singer contract with PolyGram still remained and was not completely over; after being persuaded by PolyGram staff and with Au&#x27;s help, Chan continued recording new tracks in the US and had even made a few low-key returns to Hong Kong to record new Cantonese albums during winter and summer vacations in 1991–1994. On 26 March 1992, Chan released the album &quot;&quot;Come Back&quot; (歸來吧), in which tracks like &quot;Drifting Snow&quot; (飄雪), a chart-topper adapted from Yuko Hara&#x27;s () 1991 hit &quot;The Journey of the Flowers&quot; (); &quot;Red Tea House&quot; (紅茶館), a cover version of &#x27;s () &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1972) and was awarded the 1992 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards; &quot;Moon&quot; (月亮), adapted from Taiwanese singer Mai Meng&#x27;s (孟庭葦) 1991 hit &quot;Look at the Face of the Moon&quot; (你看你看月亮的臉); and &quot;Come Back&quot; (歸來吧), adapted from Taiwanese singer-songwriter Salsa Chen&#x27;s (陳小霞) 1991 Taiwanese Hokkien song &quot;Marionette&quot; (傀儡尪仔), still became hits and even classics. The album achieved a surprisingly good result of triple platinum certification despite the fact that Chan spent most of the time in the US with minimum publicity and promotion activities in Hong Kong.

On 15 October 1993, Chan released the album &quot;Always By Your Side&quot; (你身邊永是我), with the chart-topping hit &quot;Jealousy&quot;, a cover version of Miyuki Nakajima&#x27;s () &quot;Jealousy, Jealousy&quot; () (1993). The album, certified double platinum, was also a success, and Chan filmed a special music programme titled &quot;Priscilla&#x27;s Love in New York&quot; (紐約嫻情) for TVB as promotion.

Decided to resume her musical career in 1994, Chan released the greatest hits album &quot;Who Is My Love Today&quot; (今天的愛人是誰) on 4 October in the same year, with two new tracks including the title song and chart-topping hit &quot;Who Is My Love Today&quot;, adapted from Mariko Takahashi&#x27;s () &quot;Softly...Lovin&#x27; You&quot; () (1994).

Chan graduated from Syracuse University in the end of 1994 with First Class Honours (GPA 3.66/4.00). Besides her parents, Michael Au, who had already broken up with Chan around 1991, Au&#x27;s wife, and Jacky Cheung attended Chan&#x27;s graduation ceremony held in the Syracuse University&#x27;s campus.

===1995–1997: Later years in the PolyGram Records Ltd., Hong Kong===
By 1995, Chan has returned to the music industry in full force. However, as Chan recalled, she also started to feel disappointed and discouraged to the personnel changes of the PolyGram Records she returned to after her graduation in the US. Her initial return brought her back to the top of the charts with two albums: &quot;Welcome Back&quot; and &quot;I Am Not Lonely&quot; (我不寂寞), which were released on 23 February and 3 November 1995 respectively. Chan also starred in a CRHK radio drama titled &quot;My Heart Never Dies&quot; (我心不死) with Andy Lau (劉德華). &quot;Welcome Back&quot; was a huge success which topped the record sales chart for a record of six weeks in 1995. Songs like &quot;Missing Love and Dust&quot; (戀戀風塵), &quot;It&#x27;s Always Raining Tonight&quot; (今天夜裡總下雨), &quot;Missing You&quot; (留戀) from the album &quot;Welcome Back&quot;; as well as &quot;I&#x27;m Lonely&quot; (我寂寞), which was awarded the 1995 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, and &quot;Drift&quot;&quot; (飄), selected as the 10th song among the &quot;1995 Ultimate Top 10 Songs&quot; at the 1995 Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation, from the album &quot;&quot;I Am Not Lonely&quot;&quot;, all became instant hits. The success of the two albums also earned Chan the &quot;Top 10 Outstanding Artists Award&quot; (十大優秀流行歌手大獎) in 1995 and 1996 at the RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards.

Chan&#x27;s 10-night concert residency, &quot;Priscilla Chan in Concert &#x27;96&quot; (雪映美白&#x27;96陳慧嫻演唱會) held in 1996 during the Lunar New Year period at the Hong Kong Coliseum reaffirmed her popularity with the public. Chan also released a well-received greatest hits album with new releases including the theme song for the concert, &quot;&quot;Contented&quot; (心滿意足). In the second half of 1996, Chan released another album &quot;Problematic Woman&quot; (問題女人) with the title track &quot;Problematic Woman&quot;, seeking a change in image and musical style, but with generally negative responses. Chan also filmed a special music programme series titled &quot;Wonderful Encounters in England&quot; (英倫奇緣) in the UK for TVB as promotion. Nevertheless, tracks like &quot;Wonderful Journey&quot; (奇妙旅程) and &quot;End of Fate&quot; (緣了，就是完) still achieved considerable results and the former was awarded the 1996 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards.

From 1997 onwards, Chan chose to keep a low profile in her career. She only released one Mandarin album &quot;My Heart Is About To Fly Away&quot;&quot; (心就要飛了) in March. Another two-night concert entitled &quot;Musical Encounters with Priscilla and the Philharmonic&quot; (慧嫻·港樂奇妙旅程&#x27;97演唱會) held in mid-March 1997 at the Hong Kong Coliseum with the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra (HKPhil) made her the second pop artist ever to work with the HKPhil, after Jacky Cheung. A new track &quot;&quot;Time For Two&quot; (二人時間) was released as the concert&#x27;s theme song.

===1998–2000: Years in the Cinepoly Records===
With the signing of a new recording company, Cinepoly Records, Chan&#x27;s fame started to fall. The death of her beloved cat, Remington, which she had been raising since she was studying in the US, in 1998 marked the start of the period when she found life difficult as the new recording company was also not working well for her. Her first album after signing to Cinepoly, &quot;In Love For 2000 Hours&quot; (愛戀二千小時) is a rare concept album in the Hong Kong Cantopop scene at that time and was also Chan&#x27;s new attempt made in musical style, with hits like &quot;Distance&quot; (距離) and &quot;Relish&quot; (玩味). On 18 May 1999, Chan released &quot;This Is Love&quot; (正視愛) with the title track &quot;This Is Love&quot; (正是愛). Another version, with two Mandarin songs added, was released in August the same year for entering the mainland Chinese market. Although Chan personally was not satisfied with the record sales result, the album still achieved sales of more than 15,000 units when it was first released in Hong Kong in 1999, a good sales performance at that time.

On 29 August 2000, Chan released &quot;Good For You&quot; (為你好), a retro-styled album directed by Michael Au, her long-time musical director starting from 1986, with the title track of the same name. However, the album was under-promoted and Chan, feeling discouraged, began to step back from the Hong Kong Cantopop scene.

===2001–2006: &quot;Love Knot&quot; and hiatus===
After the early termination of her contract with Cinepoly in 2001, Chan was diagnosed anxiety disorder around 2002, also because of the breaking up with her second boyfriend, Michael Cheung (張卓文), in addition to her cat&#x27;s accidental death.

In 2003, signing temporarily to Universal Music Hong Kong, Chan made a comeback with an album named &quot;Love Knot&quot; (情意結) and a two-night concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum. The album features the title track &quot;Love Knot&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Is Another Day&quot; (明日有明天), a duet track named &quot;Philandering&quot; (拈花惹草) with Jade Kwan (關心妍), as well as a remake version of Chan&#x27;s classic &quot;Silly Girl&quot; entitled &quot;The Silly Girl&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; (傻女的新衣), directed by Chan Fai-young (陳輝陽), who cooperated with Chan for the first time. However, as the album sales of only 8,000 units was way below her expectation, mostly because of the market downturn after the 2003 outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), illegal online downloading and piracy, Chan decided to retreat once again; she also criticised the general preference of Cantopop audience at that time, who she believed were only interested in admiring the artists&#x27; images but not in truly appreciating their music. However, she reiterated her desire to continue singing as many loyal fans still remained around the world.

===2007–2012: Short comeback in Hong Kong, developing in the mainland Chinese music scene===
In 2007, Chan signed temporarily with EC Music under International Entertainment Corporation (國際娛樂有限公司) until its closure in 2008, and released a new live album recorded at one performance of a two-night benefit concert held at the Kowloonbay International Trade &amp; Exhibition Centre in Hong Kong in 2008. A new track named &quot;Ring Finger&quot; (無名指) was released as the concert&#x27;s theme song.

From 2008 to 2012, Chan held concert tours in various mainland Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Nanning. During her tours in mainland China, Chan released a few Mandarin singles, such as &quot;Asia&quot; (亞細亞) (2010), one of the theme songs of the 2010 Asian Games held in Guangzhou, and &quot;Let Love Blooms&quot;&quot; (讓愛綻放) (2012), a commemorative track for the fourth-year anniversary of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

===2013–2022: Returning to the relaunched PolyGram Records in Hong Kong===

On 16 April 2013, Chan signed with Universal Music Hong Kong again, with the relaunch of the PolyGram label. On 28 August 2013, Chan participated in the &quot;PolyGram Forever Live Concert&quot; held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre with former PolyGram pop stars like Alan Tam (譚詠麟), Hacken Lee (李克勤), and Shirley Kwan (關淑怡).

Chan then released &quot;&quot;By Heart&quot;, a cover album and her first album after returning to the relaunched PolyGram Records, on 7 April 2014. The album features Chan&#x27;s cover of 10 songs produced in the former PolyGram Records. The compilation album that commemorates the 30th anniversary since her debut, &quot;Back to Priscilla&quot;&quot; (Back to Priscilla 嫻情三十), appeared on 17 June, before she held her 30th-anniversary commemorative concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum from 19 to 21 June, with Jacky Cheung and Joey Yung (容祖兒) as live guests. Kandy Wong (黃山怡), a Hong Kong singer who is regarded as a lookalike of Chan, also watched Chan&#x27;s concert and the two took a photo together. Chan then performed at the &quot;PolyGram Forever Live Concert in Singapore&quot; organised in Singapore Indoor Stadium on 19 July.

The popularity of Chan and her classic &quot;Silly Girl&quot; increased after a Hong Kong singer Don Li (李逸朗) covered the song in an exaggeratedly emotional and &quot;tearful&quot; way and became viral in early 2015. Chan announced her extension of singer contract to PolyGram records and signed her management contract to Universal Music Hong Kong on 9 April 2015. She then made her one night concert performing her greatest hits at the Resorts World Genting, Malaysia in July 2015. On 19 November, Chan released another cover album titled &quot;Evolve&quot;, which included remakes of 10 of her own classics. The album was certified gold (7,500 unit sales for cover albums) in only two days.

Chan held her fifth solo concert residency, &quot;Priscilla-ism Live 2016&quot;, at the Hong Kong Coliseum from 4 to 7 March 2016. Live guests include Hacken Lee, Kenny Bee (鍾鎮濤), Alan Tam, Andy Hui (許志安), and Grasshopper (草蜢). Soon after the concert, Chan began her &quot;Priscilla-ism&quot; tour in mainland Chinese cities, until 2020.

In 2018, the year that marks the 60th-anniversary of the deceased Cantopop superstar Danny Chan (陳百強), Priscilla Chan, as a Universal Music Hong Kong artist, covered Danny Chan&#x27;s 1983 hit &quot;&quot;Just Loving You&quot; (偏偏喜歡你), which was included in the commemorative cover album &quot;The World Sings Danny Chan&quot; (環球高歌陳百強), along with 9 other Danny Chan&#x27;s classics covered by 9 different Universal Music Hong Kong artists. On 9 September, Chan also performed &quot;Just Loving You&quot; in the concert commemorating Danny Chan&#x27;s birthday on 7 September 1958.

In May 2022, Priscilla Chan&#x27;s contract with Universal Music Hong Kong was terminated.

===2022–present: Emperor Entertainment Group===
On 28 July 2022, her 57th birthday, Priscilla Chan officially announced that she has joined the Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG). , the manager of EEG, and EEG artists such as Simon Yam, Kara Wai, Hacken Lee, Joey Yung, Leo Ku, Nicholas Tse, and Twins filmed a short video to express their congratulation and welcoming messages. In September 2022, Chan announced her participation in the mainland Chinese pop music reality show, , produced by Dragon Television. On 26 October 2022, Universal Music Hong Kong released a 3CD greatest hits album entitled &quot;Isshōkenmei&quot; (一生懸命), which includes two brand new Cantonese singles, &quot;Early Flight&quot; (早機) and &quot;Return Home&quot;&quot; (回家).

On 12 August 2023, Chan announced her participation as one of the judges for the Hong Kong singing talent show , produced by TVB. The show was aired on TVB Jade starting from 10 September 2023 and ended on 24 March 2024. On 19 November 2023, Chan attended TVB&#x27;s &quot; 2023&quot; and served as a guest performer.

On 12 November 2024, Chan announced that she would held her sixth solo concert residency, &quot;The Fabulous 40 Priscilla Live in Hong Kong&quot;, at the Hong Kong Coliseum on 21, 22, 24, and 25 January 2025. For this occasion, Chan released two brand new Cantonese singles, &quot;&quot;To My Dear Dearest&quot; (給親愛的親愛) and &quot;Accompany&quot;&quot; (陪伴). On 23 December 2024, it was announced that her Hong Kong Coliseum solo concert residency would be adding an extra night of performance on 26 January, and an online live concert &quot;Priscilla Chan The Intimate Live&quot; was held on 23 December 2024 to promote the Hong Kong Coliseum concert. On 6 January 2025, it was announced that Chan&#x27;s solo concert residency would be adding another extra night of performance on 30 January.

==Personal life==
Chan has had three publicly admitted loving relationships over the course of her adult life. The first one was with her music producer Michael Au from 1984 until some time around 1991, after Chan went for college in the US. Au has since married and has two children. Chan admitted that Au was still the one who loved her the most and her most beloved lover among her three ex-boyfriends, and their relationship had already been transformed into that between family relatives since their break-up.

After Au, in 1994, Chan dated an artist designer Michael Cheung who also worked for Chan&#x27;s image during her musical career at that time, and the relationship ended in 2002.

Chan&#x27;s latest boyfriend was Dr. Tony Tse (謝國麟), a medical doctor who was her fan and they knew each other when Chan sought medical treatment for her anxiety disorder and related health issues in the second half of 2002. Chan once publicly expressed her love to Tse in her Hong Kong concert series held in 2003. However, both agreed to end the 5-year relationship in July 2007. The cause of the break-up, according to Chan, was personality differences.

Chan is a cat-lover. She once raised 9 cats at the same time. Chan&#x27;s favourite singers include The Carpenters and Danny Chan.

Many believed that Chan made a wrong decision to leave the music industry at the peak of her career for college in 1989. Yet, Chan disagreed. She considered singing was an important part of her, but she valued education more. Furthermore, she reiterated the reason for getting a college degree was to fulfill her promise to her parents. The years studying in the US was also one of her happiest times in life.

Since 2017, Chan lives in the Beverly Hills (比華利山別墅) in the Tai Po District (大埔區).

<text>El Oso (Spanish for &quot;The Bear&quot;) is the third and final studio album by the New York City band Soul Coughing, released on September 29, 1998, by Slash Records and Warner Bros. Records. The album received generally positive critical reception upon release.

&quot;El Oso&quot; made it to #1 on KTUH&#x27;s charts on the week of January 25, 1999.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s style takes heavy inspiration from the electronic music style drum and bass, which followed after the band toured with supporting DJs Krust and Die prior to the album&#x27;s conceptualization; drum and bass DJ and producer Optical was enlisted to co-produce the album. Artist Jim Woodring (&quot;Frank&quot;) drew the cartoon &quot;monkey-bear&quot; on the disc&#x27;s cover. The chorus of the song &quot;$300&quot; is a sample of a Chris Rock joke; singer Mike Doughty heard the joke which is backmasked on Rock&#x27;s live standup album &quot;Roll with the New&quot;. Curious, Doughty recorded it into his ASR-10 sampler with the intention of simply reversing it and seeing what the joke was, and wrote the song around what he found there.

==In popular culture==
The album contains their biggest hit single, &quot;Circles&quot;. Cartoon Network aired a music video in which a &quot;Flintstones&quot; cartoon was synched to the song as part of their Groovies interstitial. The music video features Fred, Barney and other Hanna-Barbera characters walking in front of the same repeating background, with subtitles showing existential dialogue. The video for the song &quot;Rolling&quot; was also produced, which was synced with a scene from a &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoon. The song was used in the 2004 remake of &quot;Walking Tall&quot;. &quot;$300&quot; was used in the &quot;House&quot; episode &quot;The Softer Side&quot; in 2009.
