<text>He-Man and the Masters of the Universe (often referred to simply as He-Man) is an American animated television series produced by Filmation based on Mattel&#x27;s toy line &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;. The show was one of the most popular animated shows of the 1980s.
It made its television debut in September 1983 and ran until 1985, consisting of two seasons of 65 episodes each. Towards the end of the show&#x27;s original run, it spawned one feature length theatrical movie &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot;, which served as the introduction for the show&#x27;s spinoff literal sister series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;. There was also a primetime Christmas special, &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: A Christmas Special&quot;, which served as an extension of both the He-Man show and the She-ra show, and which featured cast and major locales from both shows. Both the He-Man/She-ra movie and the Christmas special were Filmation productions, set in the same continuity as the original He-Man cartoon, and with the same production cast and crew. Reruns continued to air in syndication until 1988, at which point USA Network bought the rights to the series. USA aired &quot;He-Man&quot; until September 1990. The success of the toy based show in syndication greatly influenced other animation houses to produce half hour &quot;cartoon commercials&quot;, and considerably changed the syndicated cartoon market.

The franchise has been adapted many times in comic book and comic strip form, and a live-action film was produced in 1987. A rebooted series, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, renamed &quot;Masters of the Universe vs. The Snake Men&quot; during season 2, released on Toonami on August 16, 2002. Two series were released in 2021 for Netflix: one is &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;, a continuation for an adult audience and another is a family-oriented animated CGI reboot, also titled &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The series takes place on Eternia, a planet of magic, myth and fantasy. Its lead character is Prince Adam, the young son of Eternia&#x27;s rulers King Randor and Queen Marlena. Prince Adam is also the twin brother of Princess Adora. Whenever Prince Adam holds the Sword of Power aloft and proclaims &quot;By the Power of Grayskull! I have the power!” he is endowed with &quot;fabulous secret powers&quot; and transformed into He-Man, the most powerful man in the universe. Together with his close allies, Battle Cat (who undergoes a similar transformation from being Adam&#x27;s cowardly pet tiger Cringer), The Sorceress, Teela, Man-At-Arms and Orko, He-Man uses his powers to defend Eternia from the evil forces of Skeletor.

Skeletor&#x27;s main goal is to conquer the mysterious fortress of Castle Grayskull, from which He-Man draws his powers. If successful, Skeletor would have enough power to rule all of Eternia and possibly the entire universe.

==Production history==
The Mattel company released the first wave of the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; toyline in 1982. After the Federal Communications Commission relaxed its ban on toy-based children&#x27;s programming, Mattel decided to commission a cartoon to promote their toyline. Based on their animated commercial work for Mattel, including a spot for the toyline, Filmation was chosen to produce the series. Mattel hired screenwriter Michael Halperin, experienced in live-action TV, to write a pitch bible (submitted on December 1, 1982) to flesh out the backstory both for merchandising and for the cartoon. The bible introduced He-Man&#x27;s alter-ego, as well as the planet Eternia, Queen Marlena&#x27;s origin, among others. Unfortunately, it was not considered viable, so the bible was reworked by Filmation staff writer Tom Ruegger, having already developed &quot;Blackstar&quot; along similar lines. Most of the character designs were handled by Herb Hazelton.

Some time after, both firms pitched the idea to the ABC network, who turned it down. Then, on Lou Scheimer&#x27;s suggestion, the show was re-pitched and sold at the 1983 NATPE conference to independent stations. By March 28, the show had cleared 60% of the country; by August 29 half of the 65 episodes were completed. The resulting series, &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot;, debuted through barter syndication in September 1983, and became the first syndicated show to be based on a toy. By 1984, it was seen on 120 U.S. stations and in more than 30 countries. By mid-1985, it was airing on 152 stations across the U.S., and was the most popular syndicated program with children 2–11 with a 10.9 rating in that demographic.

Despite the limited animation techniques that were used to produce the series, &quot;He-Man&quot; was notable for breaking the boundaries of censorship that had severely restricted the narrative scope of children&#x27;s TV programming in the 1970s. For the first time since Ruby-Spears&#x27;s &quot;Thundarr the Barbarian&quot;, a cartoon series could feature a muscular superhero who was actually allowed to hit people (although he more typically used wrestling-style moves rather than actually punching enemies), though he still could not use his sword often; more often than not He-Man opted to pick up his opponents and toss them away rather than hit them. The cartoon was controversial in that it was produced in connection with marketing a line of toys; advertising to children was itself controversial during this period. In the United Kingdom, advertising regulations forbade commercials for He-Man toys to accompany the program itself. In similar fashion to other shows at the time, notably &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, an attempt to mitigate the negative publicity generated by this controversy was made by including a &quot;life lesson&quot; or &quot;moral of the story&quot; at the end of each episode. This moral was usually directly tied to the action or central theme of that episode.
The show was so successful that it spawned a spin-off series, &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, following the adventures of He-Man&#x27;s sister, Princess Adora. Mattel&#x27;s subsequent attempts to relaunch the He-Man toy line also led to the short-lived sequel series &quot;The New Adventures of He-Man&quot; in 1990, and a reboot of the franchise for a contemporary audience in 2002.

It is also noted for featuring early script-writing work from J. Michael Straczynski, later the creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;; Paul Dini and Brynne Stephens, both of whom who would go on to write acclaimed episodes of &quot;&quot;; &quot;Beast Wars&quot; story editor Larry DiTillio; and David Wise, later the head-writer of the TV version of &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. In 2016, a new episode of &quot;He-Man&quot; was released.

==Music==
The series&#x27; music was composed by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban. The opening theme, snippets of which are used whenever Prince Adam transforms into He-Man and during interludes, is in C Mixolydian.

In 1984, a soundtrack album was released in France and Argentina by CBS Records and reissued on compact disc by XIII Bis in 2012, featuring music from the series and an adaptation of &quot;A Friend in Need&quot; (French release)/&quot;Diamond Ray of Disappearance&quot; (Argentine release); La-La Land Records released a two-disc, limited-edition soundtrack album in 2015, containing the musical content of the 1983 LP and much previously unreleased material.

The Latin American Spanish-language version of the show features an actual theme song complete with lyrics unique to this version, with vocals by Chilean singer Memo Aguirre (a.k.a. &quot;Captain Memo&quot;) based on Levy and Saban&#x27;s original musical score.

In 1986, Brazilian children’s music group Trem da Alegria recorded a song about He-Man.

==Reception==
&quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; is considered the most successful animated series ever made by Filmation. The show, as it was created to promote hyper-consumerism in children, left itself vulnerable to criticism. In 2009, IGN ranked the series as the 58th greatest animated show of all time in their Top 100 list.

==Home media==
In 1983–1986 RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video released the series in VHS and Beta. BCI Eclipse LLC (under its &quot;Ink &amp; Paint&quot; classic animation entertainment label) (under license from Entertainment Rights) released all 130 episodes of the original 1983 series of &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2005/2006, in 4 volume sets. Each episode on BCI Ink &amp; Paint&#x27;s &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; DVD releases were uncut, unedited, fully restored and digitally remastered for optimum audio and video quality and presented in its original broadcast presentation and story continuity order. Each volume contains an extensive array of special features including documentaries, character profiles, commentaries, DVD-ROM features, trivia, photo galleries and more. As of 2009, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print as BCI Eclipse ceased operations.

On December 10, 2010, Mill Creek Entertainment announced that they had acquired the rights from Classic Media to re-release the series on DVD in America. They have subsequently re-released the complete first season in one eight-disc set as well as two smaller 20-episode volume releases. The complete second season was released on September 13, 2011. The 2002 series, composed of four discs; 960min, was also released in 2010 by Mill Creek Entertainment, and is titled &quot;Masters of the Universe: The Complete Series&quot; (ASIN B002DQL34G). Commemorating the 30th anniversary &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; brand, Mill Creek Entertainment finally released the &quot;30th Anniversary Commemorative Collection of the Masters of the Universe&quot; DVD. The 22-disc set features all 130 episodes of the 1983 series, 20 fan-favorite episodes of the 1990 series, as well as all 39 episodes of the 2002 series.

Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released all 130 episodes of the original 1983 He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series on DVD in Region 1 on October 1, 2019, as &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete Original Series&quot;. This release includes &quot;He-Man &amp; She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot; and &quot;He-Man &amp; She-Ra: A Christmas Special&quot;.

In Region 4, Madman Entertainment released the entire series on DVD in Australia in 4 volume sets (similar to BCI Eclipse releases). These releases have been discontinued and are now out of print. A complete series box set was released by Madman on June 24, 2009; this is still available.

The pilot episode, &quot;Diamond Ray of Disappearance&quot;, has a minute or so of footage missing due to the master tapes being damaged. In the original version, after teleporting the King and Queen and Man-At-Arms away to another dimension, Skeletor turns the ray onto Orko, who gets stuck inside a vase which deflects the beam. Orko escapes to warn He-Man. This footage has not been lost; it is still existent on other media in circulation. However, complications over the rights to it prevented it from being inserted back into the DVD release.

==Sequel==

An adult Netflix Original series &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;, was released in 2021. Although initially announced as a direct sequel to the 1983 TV series, director Kevin Smith later admitted the series is not set in the same continuity as the original, but described it as a &#x27;spiritual sequel&#x27; to the Filmation series. &quot;Revelation&quot; was directed by Kevin Smith and animated by Powerhouse Animation Studios. The series aired for 10 episodes, split between two &quot;parts&quot;.

<text>Los Baños (IPA: ), officially the Municipality of Los Baños (), colloquialy &#x27;elbi&#x27; or simply LB, is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 115,353 people.

It has a total land area of and is bordered on the south and south-west by Mount Makiling and Santo Tomas in Batangas, on the north by Laguna de Bay, on the north-west by Calamba and on the east by the town of Bay. The town is located southeast of Manila and is easily accessible via the South Luzon Expressway along with Manila South Road and Calamba–Pagsanjan Road.

The municipality lies on the northern slopes of the long dormant volcano Mount Makiling and is known among tourists for its hot spring resorts. Los Baños also hosts two constituent universities of the University of the Philippines System: the University of the Philippines Los Baños and University of the Philippines Open University, along with other foreign and local and international research centers, such as the International Rice Research Institute, the ASEAN Center for Biodiversity, the Philippine Rice Research Institute, Philippine Carabao Center, and the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education Organization-Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture(SEAMEO-SEARCA) at UPLB making the town a temporary home for tens of thousands of both local and foreign undergraduate and graduate students, researchers and support staff.

Los Baños was declared as the &quot;Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines&quot; through Presidential Proclamation No. 349. The proclamation, however, does not convert the municipality to a city or give it corporate powers that are accorded to other cities.

Aside from its importance in academics, science and research, Los Baños is a well-known tourist destination. Because of the town&#x27;s proximity to Metro Manila, Los Baños&#x27;s hot spring resorts (along with those in the preceding city of Calamba starting at Barangay Pansol) are frequent weekend or summer getaways for residents of the vast metropolis and tourists from primarily the National Capital Region (Metro Manila area) and other places in the Philippines, and abroad. Tourists who visit Los Baños also come to the several native delicacies stores in the town to buy the town&#x27;s famous &quot;buko pie&quot; (coconut meat pie) as well as a home-grown brand of chocolate cake. Currently, it is Laguna&#x27;s richest municipality in terms of assets amounting to as of 2017.

==Etymology==
Los Baños is derived from Spanish for &quot;the baths&quot;, also referring to the hot springs. It was named as such in 1589 when Fr. Pedro Bautista built public baths in the present-day town.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Los Baños started as a settlement, a barrio of Bay called &quot;Mainit&quot;, the Tagalog term for &quot;hot&quot;, alluding to the thermal springs at the foot of Mount Makiling. By 1589, through a Franciscan friar, it became popularly called by its present name, &quot;Los Baños&quot;.

In 1595, a temporary building made of bamboo and cogon was built to serve as shelter for the patients who journeyed to Mainit to seek cures for their ailments. It was on September 17, 1615, when the friars administered Los Baños as a separate town from Bay.

In 1671, more permanent structures like churches and hospitals were built only to be destroyed by a fire in 1727. The structures were re-erected at a slow rate. The church which now stands in the municipal center of Los Baños dates back to 1851. The Spanish Governor&#x27;s palace was built in 1879 but was only completed in 1892.

===American invasion era===


In 1909, the University of the Philippines College of Agriculture (UPCA) was established.

The UPCA became a Japanese prisoner of war camp for nationals of the Allied countries, a target of Kempetai punitive measures, and the headquarters of a secret organization of guerrillas. On February 23, 1945, US forces of the First Battalion, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the Eleventh Airborne Division led a combined amphibious and airborne raid against the prison camp, rescuing over 2,000 Allied nationals. They killed the 250-man Japanese garrison. In order to force the prisoners to leave behind their belongings and speed up the evacuation before the Japanese could send reinforcements, US forces and Filipino guerrillas burned the camp. Only Baker Hall, the university gymnasium until 2010, remained intact. General Yamashita, the most famous World War 2 General of the Japanese, was tried and executed for war crimes in Los Baños, Laguna.

===Philippine independence===
In 1959, the 10th World Scout Jamboree was held in Los Baños, with the theme &quot;Building Tomorrow Today&quot; with an attendance of 12,203 Scouts.

The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) was established in 1960 during the administration of President Carlos P. Garcia, and soon after President Diosdado Macapagal had started his term, IRRI had begun work on the development of the new “Miracle Rice” (IR8) variety, which would later increase Philippine rice production significantly.

====Martial law era (1965-1986)====
The social unrest which arose when Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; debt-driven campaign spending led to the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis  spread beyond the capital and also triggered protests by students in UP Los Baños, most prominently in the form of a 13-day strike which saw barricades established at the UPLB Gate and Los Baños Highway Junction areas. This unrest coincided with another issue, which was the call for the UP College of Agriculture to become independent from the University of the Philippines in Diliman.

When martial law was declared in September 1972, Marcos cracked down on any form of criticism or activism, leading to the arrest of many of Los Baños residents. Among those who experienced arrest and torture during martial law were the UPLB Institute of Chemistry&#x27;s Dr. Aloysious Baes, while among those who became desaparecidos were Tish Ladlad, Cristina Catalla, Gerardo &quot;Gerry&quot; Faustino, Rizalina Ilagan, UPLB Professor Jessica Sales, and PCARRD artist-illustrator Manny Ontong. Among those confirmed to have been martyred for their beliefs was Manuel Bautista, the student leader who had spearheaded the establishment of UPLB&#x27;s Textbook Exchange and Rental Center (TERC).

In 1979, the evolution and development of academic excellence in Los Baños moved the people of Los Baños to request president Marcos to declare the municipality as &quot;A Special University Zone&quot;, granted on June 15, 1982, by virtue of letter of instruction No. 883.

Los Baños was further declared as an &quot;Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences Community&quot; on March 17, 1982, by virtue of Executive Order No. 784 (Section 23).

====Post-EDSA revolution era====

On August 7, 2000, Los Baños was declared a &quot;Special Science and Nature City of the Philippines&quot; by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 349. It was signed by then-President Joseph Estrada. The Proclamation is in recognition of the town&#x27;s important contribution in country. The municipality has remained as the country&#x27;s hub of science and nature with the presence of national and international research institutions collaborating towards the advancement of science research.

===21st century===
The 6th Flora Malesiana, a triennial gathering of people with botanical expertise regarding &quot;Malesia&quot;, was held from September 20 to 24, 2004. It provided a forum for Flora Malesiana members and encouraged publications on Malesian plants.

During the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, Los Baños played host to the aquatics events, with the newly built Trace Aquatic Center at Trace College serving as the venue.

The headquarters of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Center for Biodiversity was opened on August 8, 2006. It leased office spaces until late 2010s from the DENR-Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau (ERDB), located at the College of Forestry, University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) until it moved to its newly built own buildings at a parcel of land near the University Health Service (UHS/&#x27;Infirmary&#x27;) towards the late 2010&#x27;s/early 2020&#x27;s, which coincided with a foundation anniversary celebrations of the organization. The Philippines assumed the Chairmanship of ASEAN in 2006 and played host to the 12th ASEAN and East Asia Summits (held in Metro Cebu, January 2007).

In January 2007, the 5th ASEAN Inter-Club Age-Group Swimming Championships was held in the Trace Aqua Sports Center.

Los Baños also plays host to the UAAP, as the Trace Aquatics Center has served as the venue for the league&#x27;s swimming competitions since UAAP Season 70 until UAAP Season 76.

Currently, Los Baños is probably the densest habitat of academicians in South East Asia. Although it is a small town, it has contributed widely through scientific achievements and contributions locally and worldwide particularly on agriculture.

On December 3, 2020, firing from outside the perimeter walls, its incumbent mayor Caesar P. Perez was assassinated inside the municipal office premises by an armed assailant, with a former opposition councilor suspected to be the mastermind.

==Geography==

Los Baños is nestled between two of Southern Luzon&#x27;s most dominant geographical features – Mount Makiling to the south and south-west and Laguna de Bay to the north. In fact, Laguna de Bay&#x27;s southernmost tip is at Barangay Bambang, and Barangay Bagong Silang is already halfway up Mount Makiling. Both the mountain and the lake are volcanic features – Makiling being a potentially active volcano whose geothermal activities gave birth to the hot springs after which the town was named, and Laguna de Bay being the filled-in caldera of a massive prehistoric volcano.

Another notable geological feature is Tadlac Lake, a maar lake whose almost perfectly round shape and uncharted waters have led some locals to call it &quot;the enchanted lake&quot;. Others call it &quot;alligator lake&quot;, a reminder that it served as the last bastion of Laguna de Bay&#x27;s once-plentiful cayman population, which has since been wiped out and is now just another legendary part of Philippine history.

===Rivers===
The town of Los Baños is crossed by five rivers or creeks:
* The Dampalit river, which is named after an edible herb, &quot;dampalit&quot; (&quot;Sesuvium portulacastrum&quot;), which often grows near river shores, originates on the north face of Mt. Makiling east of the Philippine High School for the Arts, and feeds into Laguna lake at the boundary of Barangays Lalakay and Bambang.
* The Saran creek, whose headwaters begin somewhere near the municipal dumpsite, flows through Barangay Anos near the municipal cemetery, and feeds into the lake at Barangay Malinta.
* The Pele creek, named after the pili tree (&quot;Canarium ovatum&quot;), flows through the west side of Barangay Batong Malake and has its mouth at the boundary of Barangays Malinta and Mayondon.
* The Molawin River, most familiar to UPLB students because it flows through the UPLB campus and the Makiling Botanic Gardens, is named after the Molave tree (&quot;Vitex parviflora&quot;).
* The Maitim river, whose name means &quot;black&quot;, flows through the easternmost portions of Los Baños, marking the town&#x27;s boundary with its neighboring town of Bay. The Molawin and Maitim rivers merge just a few meters before feeding into Laguna de Bay at the shore of Barangay Maahas.

===Climate===
Los Baños has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Am&quot;).

<doc id="458227" wikidata="Q2791318" url="?curid=458227" title="First Battle of Gaza">
<text>The First Battle of Gaza was fought on 26 March 1917 during the first attempt by the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), which was a British Empire military formation, formed on 10 March 1916 under the command of General Archibald Murray from the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force and the Force in Egypt (1914–15), at the beginning of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. Fighting took place in and around the town of Gaza on the Mediterranean coast when infantry and mounted infantry from the Desert Column, a component of the Eastern Force, attacked the town. Late in the afternoon, on the verge of capturing Gaza, the Desert Column was withdrawn due to concerns about the approaching darkness and large Ottoman reinforcements. This British defeat was followed a few weeks later by the even more emphatic defeat of the Eastern Force at the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917.

In August 1916, the EEF victory at Romani ended the possibility of land-based attacks on the Suez Canal, first threatened in February 1915 by the Ottoman Raid on the Suez Canal. In December 1916, the newly created Desert Column&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Magdhaba secured the Mediterranean port of El Arish and the supply route, water pipeline and railway stretching eastwards across the Sinai Peninsula. In January 1917, the victory of the Desert Column at the Battle of Rafa completed the capture of the Sinai Peninsula and brought the EEF within striking distance of Gaza.

Two months later, in March 1917, Gaza was attacked by Eastern Force infantry from the 52nd (Lowland) Division reinforced by an infantry brigade. This attack was protected from the threat of Ottoman reinforcements by the Anzac Mounted Division and a screen from the Imperial Mounted Division. The infantry attack from the south and southeast on the Ottoman garrison in and around Gaza was strongly resisted. While the Imperial Mounted Division continued to hold off threatening Ottoman reinforcements, the Anzac Mounted Division attacked Gaza from the north. They succeeded in entering the town from the north, while a joint infantry and mounted infantry attack on Ali Muntar captured the position. However, the lateness of the hour, the determination of the Ottoman defenders, and the threat from the large Ottoman reinforcements approaching from the north and north east resulted in the decision by the Eastern Force to retreat. It has been suggested that this move snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.

==Background==

As the Allied operations in the Middle East were secondary to the Western Front campaign, reinforcements requested by General Sir Archibald Murray, commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), were denied. Further, on 11 January 1917, the War Cabinet informed Murray that large scale operations in Palestine were to be deferred until September, and he was informed by Field Marshal William Robertson, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, that he should be ready to send possibly two infantry divisions to France. One week later, Murray received a request for the first infantry division and dispatched the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. He was assured that none of his mounted units would be transferred from the EEF, and was told &quot;that there was no intention of curtailing such activities as he considered justified by his resources.&quot; Murray repeated his estimate that five infantry divisions, in addition to the mounted units, were needed for offensive operations.

After 26 February 1917, when an Anglo-French Congress at Calais decided on a spring offensive, Murray received strong encouragement. The decision by the Supreme War Council was given increased impetus for &quot;Allied activity&quot; on 8 March when the Russian Revolution began. By 11 March Baghdad in Mesopotamia had been occupied by British Empire forces, and an offensive in Macedonia had been launched. In April the Battle of Arras was launched by the British, and the French launched the Nivelle offensive. Britain&#x27;s three major war objectives now were to maintain maritime supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, while preserving the balance of power in Europe and the security of Egypt, India, and the Persian Gulf. The latter could be secured by an advance into Palestine and the capture of Jerusalem. A further advance would ultimately cut off the Ottoman forces in Mesopotamia from those on the Arabian Peninsula and secure the region.

By 5 February the water pipeline from the Egyptian Sweet Water Canal, which carried water from the Nile, had reached El Arish, while the railway line was being laid well to the east of that place. The creation of this infrastructure enabled a strong defensive position and a forward base to be established at El Arish. There were now two possible directions for an advance towards Jerusalem by Eastern Force to take: through Rafa on the coast, or inland through Hafir El Auja, on the Ottoman railway. Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, commanding Eastern Force, thought that an advance along the coast could force the Ottoman Army to withdraw their inland forces, as they became outflanked and subject to attack by the EEF from the rear. He proposed keeping two divisions at El Arish, moving his headquarters there, while his mounted division would advance to reoccupy Rafa (captured by the Desert Column on 9 January during the Battle of Rafa).

With the 11 January War Cabinet decision reversed by the 26 February Congress, the EEF was now required to capture the stronghold of Gaza as a first step towards the capture of Jerusalem. The town was one of the most ancient cities in the world, being one of five cities of the Palestine Alliance, which had been fought over many times during its 4,000-year history. By 1917 Gaza had an important depot for cereals with a German steam mill. In the area barley, wheat, olives, vineyards, orange groves, and wood for fuel were grown, as well as the grazing of many goats. Barley was exported to England for brewing into beer. Maize, millet, beans, and watermelon were cultivated in most of the surrounding localities, and harvested in early autumn.

===Mounted units reorganised===
A pause in the EEF&#x27;s advance was necessary to enable the lines of communication to be lengthened and strengthened. While this work was being carried out, the mounted brigades were reorganised into two mounted divisions. This was prompted by the arrival of the 6th Mounted Brigade and 22nd Mounted Brigade from the Salonika campaign. Instead of grouping the two new mounted brigades with the 5th Mounted Brigade to form a new Imperial Mounted Division, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was transferred from the Anzac Mounted Division to the new division, and replaced by the 22nd Mounted Brigade. The Imperial Mounted Division, established 12 February 1917 at Ferry Post on the Suez Canal under the command of Major General Henry West Hodgson, was established with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and 4th Light Horse Brigade (which was in the process of formation at Ferry Post and was scheduled to leave for the front on 18 March) along with the 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades. Within Dobell&#x27;s Eastern Force, General Philip Chetwode commanded the Desert Column, which included the Anzac Mounted Division, the partly formed Imperial Mounted Division, and the 53rd (Welsh) Division of infantry. After the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division left for the Western Front, Dobell&#x27;s Eastern Force consisted of four infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) Division, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, which had recently been formed by converting yeomanry regiments into infantry battalions.

===EEF raid on Khan Yunis===

Dobell thought the victory at Rafa should be quickly exploited by attacking Gaza; &quot;an early surprise attack was essential ... otherwise it was widely believed the enemy would withdraw without a fight.&quot; He ordered Rafa to be occupied by mounted troops while two infantry divisions of Eastern Force remained at El Arish to defend his headquarters.

On 23 February, the Anzac Mounted Division and the 53rd (Welsh) Division, commanded by Major General S.F. Mott, were camped on the beach at Sheikh Zowaiid. Here they were joined by the 22nd Mounted Brigade, replacing the 5th Mounted Brigade which returned to El Burj. That day, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the 2nd Light Horse Brigades commanded by Edward Chaytor made a reconnaissance in force to Khan Yunis past Rafa. Khan Yunis was held in strength, and the Chaytor&#x27;s Column withdrew after &quot;a brush&quot; with the defenders. The town was found to be part of a line of strong posts held by the Ottoman Army protecting southern Palestine. Known as the Hans Yonus–El Hafir line, these posts consisted of well-dug trenches. They were located at Shellal, which was a particularly strongly fortified position, at Weli Sheikh Nuran, at Beersheba, and at Khan Yunis.

As a consequence of the reconnaissance to Khan Yunis, and the growing strength of EEF units in the area, the Ottoman Army garrisons realised the line was nevertheless too weak to be successfully defended. In February, Enver Pasha, Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, and Cemal Pasha withdrew from the line, retiring northwards. Here they established much more formidable defences in front of Gaza, to stop any Allied advance up the coast. This withdrawal was completed by mid–March when the Ottoman Fourth Army was in position. Their new defensive line stretched north and north east, from Gaza on the north side of the Wadi Ghuzzee to Tel esh Sheria, where the Palestine railway crossed the Wadi esh Sheria.

On 28 February, Chetwode&#x27;s Desert Column occupied Khan Yunis unopposed and the headquarters of the Column was established at Sheikh Zowaiid, while Eastern Force headquarters remained at El Arish. The ancient town of Khan Yunis on the main road to Gaza was said to be the birthplace of Delilah. With bazaars, narrow streets and a castle, it was one of several villages in this fertile area of southern Palestine, north of Rafa and the Egyptian–Ottoman frontier. Here was found the largest and deepest well in the area, and after engineers had installed a pumping machine, it gave an unlimited supply of water for both men and horses. The village quickly became an important forward site for supply depots and bivouacs. Around Khan Yunis gardens, orange orchards, fig plantations and grazing were carried on by the local population, while in the Rafa and Sheikh Zowaiid areas barley and wheat were grown.

===EEF aerial bombing===
A series of bombing raids on the railway from Junction Station to Tel el Sheria aimed to disrupt the Ottoman lines of communication during the build-up to the battle. No. 1 Squadron Australian Flying Corps and No. 14 Squadron bombed Beersheba in mid February, destroying 3 German planes, and on 25 February assisted a French battleship&#x27;s shelling of Jaffa, by directing the ship&#x27;s fire. On the same day, the German aerodrome at Ramleh was bombed. Then on 5 March six aircraft of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) conducted bombing attacks intended to interfere with the Ottoman withdrawal from the Khan Yunis line. They bombed Beersheba and the Palestine railway at Tel esh Sheria to the northwest. Although the damage was not great, the railway at Tel esh Sheria continued to be bombed in moonlight on 7 March, by relays of aircraft. Junction Station and supply depot, an important junction of southern Palestine railways with the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway many miles to the north, was also bombed on 9, 13, and 19 March.

==Prelude==

===Defending force===

British estimates of the defenders facing the EEF in the region at the beginning of 1917 were no more than 12,000, with the possibility of receiving at most one division as reinforcements.

In early March, Gaza was garrisoned by two battalions, supported by two batteries of Ottoman field artillery. The &quot;Group Tiller&quot; garrison from the Ottoman Fourth Army was later increased to seven battalions. The Group consisted of the Ottoman 79th and 125th Infantry Regiments, the 2nd Battalion of the 81st Infantry Regiment, one squadron of cavalry and one company of camelry.

Further reinforcements of between 10,000 and 12,000 soldiers were ordered by Kress von Kressenstein as a result of the 300th Flight Detachment&#x27;s reports of the EEF&#x27;s advances towards Gaza. Arriving before Eastern Force made its attack, these reinforcements consisted of the 3rd Infantry Division (31st and 32nd Infantry Regiments) from Jemmame, and the 16th Infantry Division (47th and 48th Infantry Regiments) from Tel esh Sheria. They were supported by 12 heavy mountain howitzers in two Austrian batteries, two 10-cm long guns in a German battery (from Pasha I) and two Ottoman field artillery batteries.

Further, the Ottoman 53rd Infantry Division, which had been garrisoned at Jaffa, was ordered to march south to Gaza, but was not expected before the morning of 27 March. Kress von Kressenstein, the commander of the Ottoman defences, moved his headquarters from Beersheba to Tel esh Sheria where it remained until June.

However, by 20 March the British considered the Ottoman Army defending Gaza and dominating the coastal route from Egypt to Jaffa, to be &quot;steadily deteriorating.&quot; Indeed it had been reported that Kress von Kressenstein complained of &quot;heavy losses&quot; caused by deserters, and between the EEF victory at Rafa in early January and the end of February, 70 deserters had arrived in the EEF lines. These were thought to be a &quot;very small proportion&quot; of the majority of Arabs and Syrians in particular, who disappeared from the Ottoman army, &quot;into the towns and villages of Palestine and Trans-Jordan.&quot; The EEF were unaware of the recent Ottoman reinforcements and thought the garrison at Gaza was 2,000 strong. However, by the eve of battle there were probably almost 4,000 rifles defending the town, with up to 50 guns in the surrounding area, while a force of 2,000 rifles garrisoned Beersheba.

====Ottoman Army defences====

Between Rafa and Gaza, to the east of the coastal sand dunes, a gently rolling plateau of light, firm soil rose slowly inland, crossed by several dry wadis, which became torrential flows in the rainy season. In the spring, after the winter rains, the area was covered by young crops or fresh grass. For millennia, Gaza had been the gateway for invading armies travelling the coastal route, to and from Egypt and the Levant. The town and the fertile surrounding areas strongly favoured defence; Gaza being located on a plateau high which is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by about of sand hills to the west. To the north, west, and south, orchards surrounded by impenetrable prickly pear hedges extended out for some from the town. With the exception of the ridge extending southwards, which culminated in the dominating high Ali Muntar, the area of orchards stretched from the high plateau down into a hollow.

In addition to these natural defences, the Ottoman Army constructed trenches and redoubts that extended from the south west of the town virtually all the way round the town, except for a gap to the north east. In the process they incorporated Ali Muntar into the town entrenchments by building additional defences on the ridge to the south of the town. Although the trenches were only lightly strengthened with barbed wire, those to the south of Gaza commanded bare slopes which were completely devoid of any cover whatsoever.

====Plan of defence====

As a result of the EEF advance to Rafa and their lengthening of their lines of communication along the coast, flank attacks became a threat. This was because the Ottoman lines of communication further inland overlapped the EEF advance on the coast, and it became important to garrison the region strongly. The EEF right flank would not be in prepared defences, and was potentially vulnerable to an envelopment assault.

Kress von Kressenstein, therefore, deployed most of his defending army away from Gaza to attack the EEF&#x27;s supply lines. British intelligence thought the defenders would not fight hard for Gaza, because Kress von Kressenstein&#x27;s plan was to use the 3rd and the 16th Infantry Divisions and the 3rd Cavalry Division to encircle the attacking force and cut the Sinai railway and water pipeline, in the rear of the EEF. A total of 12,000 of the available 16,000 Ottoman soldiers were moving west, to be in position to launch an attack by nightfall on the day of battle.

The main Ottoman force of between two and a half and three divisions, estimated between 6,000 and 16,000 rifles, were deployed at Tel el Negile and Huj with detachments at Tel esh Sheria, Jemmameh, Hareira, Beersheba, and Gaza, to prevent the EEF from out-flanking Gaza. The rear of the EEF was to be attacked by the Ottoman 16th Division, at a point where the road from Khan Yunis to Gaza crossed the Wadi Ghuzze, and by the Beersheba Group which was to advance via Shellal, to attack Khan Yunis.

===Attacking force===

The 22,000-strong attack force consisted of 12,000 infantry and 11,000 mounted troops, supported by between 36 and 96 field guns and 16 howitzers. The mounted units were to stop the Ottoman reinforcements from Tel el Sheria, Jemmameh, Hareira, Negile, Huj, and Beersheba, from reinforcing the Gaza garrison while the infantry captured the town.

The chain of command during the first Battle of Gaza was:
#Murray&#x27;s Advanced GHQ EEF at El Arish, without reserves; its role was to advise only,
#Dobell&#x27;s Eastern Force headquarters near In Seirat commanded three infantry divisions, two mounted divisions and a brigade of camels. This force was equivalent to an army of two corps, but only had a staff which was smaller than an army corps serving on the western front,
#Chetwode&#x27;s Desert Column headquarters also near In Seirat, commanded the equivalent of a corps, with a staff the size of an infantry division.

====Lines of communication====

The Ottoman withdrawal back from Khan Yunis and Shellal, put enough distance between the two forces to require a pause in the advance, while the railway was laid to Rafa. By the end of February 1917, of railway had been laid (at a rate of 1 kilometre a day), of metalled road, of wire and brushwood roads, and of water pipeline had been constructed. And the Royal Navy undertook to land stores on the beach at Deir el Belah as soon as required and until the railway approached the Wadi Ghazzee.

By 1 March the railhead had reached Sheikh Zowaiid from Gaza, and by the middle of March the railway had reached Rafa, from Deir el Belah. Although the Rafa railway station opened on 21 March, it &quot;was not ready for unloading supplies&quot; until after the battle. The railhead was to eventually reached Khan Yunis. However, with the arrival of the railway at Rafa, Gaza came within range of an EEF attack by mounted troops and infantry.

====Transport====
With firmer ground the pedrails came off the guns and their teams of eight and ten horses were reduced to six. It also became possible to use wheeled vehicles, and in January the War Office agreed to the infantry divisions being re-equipped with wheeled transport trains. These were to replace camel transport, on the condition that drivers would be found locally, as no transfers from other campaigns were possible. Although camel trains remained important throughout the war, together with pack mules and donkeys, where roads were bad and in hilly trackless terrain, where the horse-drawn and mule-drawn wagons, motor lorries and tractors could not go, they began to be replaced. General service and limber wagons drawn by horses or mules were grouped in supply columns, with the transport wagons of the regiments, the machine–gun squadrons, and the field ambulances, to travel on easier but less direct routes. However, all these animals required vast quantities of food and water, which greatly increased pressure on the lines of communication. During the advance across the Sinai, although it was established that horses did better with two drinks a day instead of three, the volume remained the same.

Supplying the infantry and mounted divisions was a vast undertaking, as one brigade (and there were six involved in the attack on Gaza) of light horse, mounted rifles, and yeomanry at war establishment consisted of approximately 2,000 soldiers as well as the division of infantry; all requiring food and drink, clothing, ammunition and tools, etc.

Transport was organised, combining the horse-drawn and mule-drawn supply columns with the camel trains, to support Eastern Force operating beyond railhead for about 24 hours. &quot;The wagons [of the Anzac Mounted Division] with their teams of mules, two in the pole and three in the lead, [were] driven by one man from the box.&quot; These wagons and mules were so successful that the five-mule team was &quot;laid down for the Egyptian Expeditionary Force ... ultimately almost supersed[ing] the British four or six horse ride-and-drive team.&quot;

====Plan of attack====

Although Murray delegated the responsibility for the battle to Dobell, he set three objectives. These were to capture a line along the Wadi Ghuzzee in order to cover the laying of the railway line, to prevent the defenders withdrawing before they were attacked, and to &quot;capture Gaza and its garrison by a &quot;coup de main.&quot;&quot; The plan of attack produced by Dobell and his staff, was similar to those successfully implemented at Magdhaba by Chauvel and at Rafa by Chetwode, except that the EEF infantry were to have a prominent role. On a larger scale than the previous battles, the garrison at Gaza, established in fortified entrenchments and redoubts, was to be surrounded and captured, before Ottoman reinforcements could arrive.

The main attack on the town and Ali Muntar hill would come from the south, by the Desert Column&#x27;s 53rd (Welsh) Division commanded by Dallas, supported by one infantry brigade of Eastern Force&#x27;s 54th (East Anglian) Division, commanded by Hare. The Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions, commanded by Chauvel and Hodgson respectively, were to establish a screen or cordon around Gaza to the north and east to isolate the garrison, cutting the main roads and preventing an incursion by Ottoman reinforcements reaching the town from their garrisons at Hareira, Beersheba, and Huj. If necessary, the mounted divisions were to be ready to reinforce the infantry attack, while the remaining infantry brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division extended the mounted screen to the southeast, just across the Wadi Ghuzzee.

On 5 March, Murray agreed to Dobell&#x27;s plan for the attack, which was to be launched at the end of March. On 20 March Dobell moved his headquarters from El Arish to Rafa. The next day, the Rafa Race Meeting took place, complete with trophies ordered from Cairo, and a printed programme. These races, complete with an enclosed paddock, totalizator, jumps, and a marked course, were contested by Yeomanry, Australian and New Zealand horses and riders. On 22 March, all roads and tracks were reconnoitred as far as Deir el Belah and allotted to the different formations, and preliminary moves towards Gaza were begun.

Dallas&#x27; orders were handed to the Anzac, Imperial Mounted, and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions&#x27; commanders at 17:00 on 25 March. The 53rd (Welsh) Division&#x27;s 158th (North Wales) and 160th Brigades were to begin crossing the Wadi Ghuzzeh at 03:30 and advance up the Burjabye and Es Sire ridges, while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade which followed the 158th (North Wales) across the wadi, was to remain close to the wadi until further orders were received. Money&#x27;s Detachment was to cross the wadi mouth and hold a position in the sand dunes between the Rafa-Gaza road and the sea to divert the Ottoman defenders&#x27; attention, and cover a section of the 15th Heavy Battery. A section of 91st Heavy Battery was to move into the wadi, while a section the 10th Heavy Battery of 60-pdrs was attached to the 160th Brigade Group. However, artillery ammunition was limited and was to mainly target the Labyrinth group of Ottoman defences. The mounted divisions were to isolate Gaza by stopping the Gaza garrison retiring, or any reinforcements from Huj and Hareira areas, attempting to reinforce Gaza. They were to pursue any hostile force that showed signs of retiring, and if necessary, support the main assault on Gaza, which was to be carried out by the 53rd (Welsh) Division. This division was to be reinforced if necessary by the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division. At 18:00 Murray, the commander in chief of the EEF, established his headquarters in the carriage of a railway train at El Arish.

====Preliminary moves====
On 25 March, the Anzac Mounted Division moved out of their bivouacs in two columns. The first column, consisting of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and the 22nd Mounted Yeomanry Brigades, marched up the beach from Bir Abu Shunnar at 02:30, to establish a line just south of the Wadi Ghuzzeh. This advance was to cover reconnaissances of the Wadi Ghuzzeh, which would search for the best places to cross this deep, dry, and formidable obstacle, for both infantry and mounted troops as they advanced towards Gaza. The second column, consisting of Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s divisional headquarters, Signal Squadron, Field Artillery, and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade (forming divisional reserve), arrived southwest of Deir el Belah. Here the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the artillery were ordered to water and bivouac at Deir el Belah. By 10:00, Chauvel&#x27;s Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s headquarters and Chetwode&#x27;s Desert Column headquarters had been established on Hill 310.

While the Ottoman army positions at Gaza had been reconnoitred and photographed from the air, it was still necessary for the staff of the Anzac and Imperial Mounted Divisions, along with the Commander of the Royal Artillery (CRA), to carry out personal reconnaissances of the Wadi Ghuzzeh. By the afternoon all likely crossings had been carefully reconnoitred, and the chosen crossing near the Wadi Sharta, which was to be used the next day, marked.

At 15:30 the Imperial Mounted Division, led by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, marched out of camp at Marakeb, heading for Deir el Belah about six hours or away. The division&#x27;s three brigades and their machine gun squadrons were accompanied by their mobile veterinary sections and the 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance. The troopers carried their day&#x27;s rations, while rations for 26 and 27 March were to be transported forward during the night of 25/26 March, by the first line transport of camels and wagons. As it had been expected the division would be away five days, additional rations were carried on improvised packs, which accompanied the division as far as Deir el Belah.

====Approach marches 26 March====
On the day of battle, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, moved out from Deir el Belah at 01:00 in four columns towards El Breij, followed by the artillery. At 02:30 the Anzac Mounted Division left Deir el Belah with the Imperial Mounted Division following at 03:00, heading for the Um Jerrar crossing of the Wadi Ghazze east of Deir el Belah. Dallas commanding the infantry established his battle headquarters near El Breij at 03:45, while Chetwode arrived at Desert Column headquarters at In Seirat at 06:37, although he intended to continue moving on to Sheikh Abbas. Dobell commanding Eastern Force arrived from Rafa, at his battle headquarters just north of In Seirat at 06:45.

Fog had begun to develop and from about 03:50 became very thick. It remained for about four hours, then began to lift. Just before dawn at 05:00, it was so dense that objects could not be seen away, but by this time most of the infantry had crossed the wadi. However, the fog made it impossible for Dallas to reconnoitre the proposed battleground, and he waited at El Breij for it to lift while his two leading brigades moved slowly forward. Visibility was improving about 07:30, and by 07:55 the fog had lifted sufficiently for heliographs to be used. However, all aircraft in No. 1 Squadron had to return to their new landing ground at Rafa, as nothing of the ground could be seen from the air. Dallas&#x27; 53rd (Welsh) Division was moving forward, despite the fog to make a direct assault on Gaza. At 05:20, the division&#x27;s 158th (North Wales) and the 160th infantry brigades were crossing the Wadi Ghuzze while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade was in reserve. By 06:50 the 160th Brigade had moved towards Shaluf and the 158th (North Wales) Brigade was moving towards Mansura, but they were ordered to slow down because artillery support may not be available, if the fog were to suddenly lift. By 07:50, the leading battalions were approaching Sheikh Seehan without having encountered any Ottoman defenders. Between 08:15 and 08:55 hostile planes flew over the advancing infantry, firing their machine guns into the columns. At 08:30 the 160th (Welsh) Brigade was about from Gaza, with their leading battalion southwest of the commanding heights of their main objective, Ali Muntar. The 158th (North Wales) Brigade had reached Mansura, and by 09:30 they were three quarters of a mile (1.2 km) north of the 53rd (Welsh) Division&#x27;s headquarters at Mansura.

Meanwhile, the 54th (East Anglian) Division (less 161st Essex Brigade in Eastern Force reserve) was ordered to cross the Wadi Ghuzzeh immediately after the mounted troops, and take up a position at Sheikh Abbas to cover the rear of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, and keep the corridor open along which it was to attack. The division took up position on Sheikh Abbas Ridge and began digging trenches facing east. The 161st (Essex) Brigade moved to El Burjabye, where it would be able to support either the 53rd (Welsh) Division, or the 54th (East Anglian) Division covering the right rear of the attack, at Sheikh Abbas.

Money&#x27;s Detachment moved towards the wadi in preparation for crossing at dawn, while the 91st Heavy Battery was covered by the Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Own Yeomanry and the divisional cavalry squadron, moved to a position on the Rafa-Gaza road.

====Encirclement====

While the fog made navigation difficult, it also shielded the movement of large bodies of troopers, so the two mounted divisions with the Imperial Camel Brigade attached, rapidly cut the roads leading to Gaza from the north and east, isolating the Ottoman garrison, in a long cavalry screen.

The leading division, the Anzac Mounted Division, first encountered hostile forces at 08:00. At that time the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was attacked near Sheikh Abbas. Shortly afterwards, hostile aircraft fired machine guns on these leading Desert Column mounted troops. As the mounted screen crossed the Gaza to Beersheba road, they cut the telegraph lines, and a patrol captured ten wagons, while other units captured 30 German pioneers and their pack-horses. At this time, the German commander at Tel esh Sheria, Kress von Kressenstein, received an aerial report describing the advance of two enemy infantry divisions towards Gaza, and about three enemy cavalry divisions and armoured cars, had advanced north between Gaza and Tel esh Sheria. Major Tiller, commanding the Gaza garrison, reported later being attacked from the south, east, and northeast &quot;in great strength.&quot; He was ordered to hold Gaza &quot;to the last man.&quot;

Soon after 09:00 the 2nd Light Horse Brigade reached Beit Durdis, closely followed by the remainder of their Anzac Mounted Division. At 09:30 four &quot;Officers Patrols&quot; were sent forward towards Huj, Najd north northeast of Huj, Hareira, Tel el Sheria and towards the Ottoman railway line. The headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division was established at Beit Durdis, and by 10:10 communications by cable with Desert Column, the Imperial Mounted Division, and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were established. Heliograph stations were also set up and wireless communications established, but the wireless was blocked by a more powerful Ottoman transmitter at Gaza. By 10:30, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had taken up a position (known as Australia Hill) overlooking Gaza from the northeast, and had occupied the village of Jebaliye northeast of Gaza. Half an hour later, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was pushing westwards and by 11:30 had reached the Mediterranean coast, to complete the encirclement of Gaza. In the process, this regiment captured the commander of the Ottoman 53rd Division (not to be confused with the 53rd Welsh Division) and his staff, who had been on their way to strengthen the Gaza garrison. At this time, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was concentrated near Beit Durdis, while the 22nd Mounted Brigade formed up south of them. Two squadrons of the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade) moved towards Deir Sneid northeast of Gaza, to watch and wait for the expected approach of reinforcements moving to strengthen Gaza.

The Imperial Mounted Division sent patrols towards Hareira, Tel esh Sheria, Kh. Zuheilika and Huj, during their advance to Kh er Reseim where they arrived at 10:00, to connect with the Anzac Mounted Division. Meanwhile, at 09:45, a squadron from the Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars (5th Mounted Brigade) had encountered hostile units northwest of Kh. el Baha which they charged, capturing 60 prisoners. A further two squadrons of the 5th Mounted Brigade pushed forward towards Kh. el Baha south east of Kh er Reseim, north of the Gaza to Beersheba road, where they remained in support.

The two mounted divisions were now in position, watching for the expected Ottoman reinforcements. By between 11:00 and 11:35, more or less all mounted troops were under fire. This fire came from shells launched from Gaza, or from German or Ottoman planes flying over Beit Durdis, as well as a long range gun, while another gun also fired on the mounted units. The battery of the 5th Mounted Brigade fired on some small groups of Ottoman infantry, but the hostile long range gun accurately returned fire, causing this battery to change position. Very little fighting had yet taken place, so far as the mounted units were concerned, and the infantry attack had not made much progress. However, news was beginning to come in from the overwatching Desert Column patrols, reporting movements from the direction of Huj and the Beersheba railway line, and columns of dust in the direction of Tel esh Sharia, all indicating large scale Ottoman Army movements in progress. However, by 12:00 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, had not yet received any reports of Ottoman reinforcements moving towards Gaza, and he sent a message to Chauvel commanding the Anzac Mounted Division and Hodgson commanding the Imperial Mounted Division, to prepare to send a brigade each to assist the infantry attack on Gaza.

The Imperial Camel Brigade crossed the Wadi Ghuzzeh at Tel el Jemmi south of the crossings at Um Jerrar, to reach El Mendur on the bank of the Wadi esh Sheria. Here they established an outpost line between the right of the 5th Mounted Brigade and the Wadi Ghuzzeh. The mobile sections of the field ambulances, followed by their immobile sections and ambulance camel transport, moved towards their outpost positions northeast and east of Gaza. With the wadi crossed and strongly defended by the EEF, divisional engineers quickly began to pump water from below the dry bed of the Wadi Ghuzzeh, which was eventually sufficient for all troops engaged. Water was pumped into long rows of temporary canvas troughs for the horses.

==Battle==

===Infantry attack===

Gaza was now completely surrounded and, following Desert Column&#x27;s orders, the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which had not seen action since the Gallipoli campaign, made a direct attack from the south and east towards Ali Muntar. Their 160th Brigade advanced towards Esh Sheluf to get into position by 08:30, with the 158th (North Wales) Brigade advancing towards Mansura, while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, which had crossed the wadi by 08:25, had to wait an hour before Dallas ordered them to Mansura to support the 158th Brigade. This delay meant that the 159th could not get into position to take part in the attack until noon. Dallas &quot;had not yet decided&quot; what to do with the 159th. While he met with his brigadiers at the 158th Brigade&#x27;s headquarters at 10:15, to discuss detailed arrangements of the attack, he was out of communication with Chetwode. This lasted for two hours while his headquarters was moved forward. Dallas contacted Chetwode at 10:50, blaming the delay on the difficulty of bringing the artillery forward, but confirmed he would be ready to launch the attack at 12:00. Due to communication breakdown, Dallas was unaware of the position of the artillery. He had phoned Desert Corps at &quot;10.4&quot; [sic] to be told that the 161st (Essex) Brigade and the 271st RFA were at Sheikh Nebhan. However, they had moved to an exposed position at El Burjabye before finding a covered position in the valley between the Burjabye and Es Sire Ridges. The artillery was in fact already in position and had begun firing at 10:10, although communications had not been established with headquarters. Fog has also been blamed for the delayed infantry attack. The artillery bombardment began at 12:00, although there was no artillery program, and the Ottoman defences had not been identified.

Dallas received his orders at 11:00, and half an hour later Dobell and Chetwode ordered him to launch his attack forthwith. By 11:30, Desert Column staff considered that the 53rd (Welsh) Division was practically stationary, and the following message was sent to Dallas: &quot;I am directed to observe that (1) you have been out of touch with Desert Column and your own headquarters for over two hours; (2) no gun registration appears to have been carried out; (3) that time is passing, and that you are still far from your objective; (4) that the Army and Column Commanders are exercised at the loss of time, which is vital; (5) you must keep a general staff officer at your headquarters who can communicate with you immediately; (6) you must launch your attack forthwith.&quot; A similar message was sent again at 12:00.

Dallas ordered the attack to begin at 11:45 on Ali Muntar by the 160th Brigade which advanced to attack their objective along the Es Sire Ridge, while the 158th (North Wales) which advanced from Mansura, also attacked Ali Muntar. These two infantry brigades had been in position awaiting orders for between three and four hours, while the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade rapidly deployed. They were about from their objectives with patrols going forward, with the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade (less one battalion), covering their right, advancing to attack the hummock known as Clay Hill. This objective was located to the north of Ali Muntar, on the far side of the Gaza to Beersheba road. The attacking brigades were supported by two field artillery brigades, while a divisional reserve was formed by one battalion of the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, until the arrival of the 161st (Essex) Brigade (Eastern Force&#x27;s 54th Division). The attacking infantry brigades met with stubborn opposition from determined defenders, firing from strong entrenchments with a clear view of the infantry line of advance, over completely open ground. In these conditions, the attacking infantry&#x27;s artillery support proved inadequate and a very high number of casualties was suffered.

In support, the 54th (East Anglian) Division (less one brigade in Eastern Force reserve) was ordered to cross the Wadi Ghuzzeh immediately after the mounted troops and take up a position at Sheikh Abbas, to cover the rear of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, and keep open the corridor along which the attack was launched. At 11:45 the 161st (Essex) Brigade (54th Division, Eastern Force) was ordered to advance to Mansura in support of the attacking brigades, but the message was apparently never received. At 13:10 an order which had originated from Eastern Force at 12:45 was finally received by hand from a staff officer.

===Combined attack===

By noon, Chetwode was concerned that the strength of the opposition to the infantry attack, could make it impossible to capture Gaza before dark. As a consequence, he ordered Chauvel and Hodgson to reconnoitre towards Gaza, warning them to be prepared to supply one brigade each to reinforce the infantry attack. At 13:00 Chetwode put Chauvel in command of both mounted divisions, and by 14:00 Chauvel was ordering the whole of the Anzac Mounted Division to attack Gaza from the north, while the Imperial Mounted Division and Imperial Camel Brigade, supported by Nos 11 and 12 Light Armoured Motor Batteries and No. 7 Light Car Patrol, were to hold the outpost line and all observation posts. As the Anzac Mounted Division moved north, it was replaced in the mounted screen by the Imperial Mounted Division, which in turn was replaced by the Imperial Camel Brigade.
It took time for the divisions to get into position, and to move Chauvel&#x27;s headquarters to a knoll between Beit Durdis and Gaza, so he could oversee operations. It was not until during a meeting there at 15:15 that orders were issued for the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s attack. They deployed with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on a front extending from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gaza to Jebalieh road, the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade deployed from the Gaza-Jebalieh road to the top of the ridge running northeast, while the Lincolnshire Yeomanry and Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry regiments, of the 22nd Mounted Brigade, held from the right of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade to the track leading to Beit Durdis.

During this time, the infantry attack on Gaza by the 53rd (Welsh) Division had been progressing. By 13:30, the 160th Brigade on the left had advanced rapidly to capture the Labyrinth, a maze of entrenched gardens due south of Gaza. Their 2/10th Middlesex Regiment established themselves on a grassy hill, while their 1/4th Royal Sussex Regiment advanced up the centre of the Es Sire ridge under intense hostile fire, suffering heavy casualties including their commanding officer. Having reached the crest, they were forced to fall back in some disorder by the Ottoman defenders. However, after being reinforced at 16:00 they recommenced their advance. On the right the 158th (North Wales) Brigade&#x27;s 1/5th Royal Welsh Fusiliers battalion reached the cactus hedges south of Ali Muntar, where they paused to wait for supporting battalions to come up on their right. Along with the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade, these two brigades slowly fought their way forward towards Clay Hill. Meanwhile, Dallas ordered the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division to capture Green Hill and fill the gap between the 158th (North Wales) and 160th Brigades (53rd Division). By 15:30 the 161st (Essex) Brigade had reached Mansura and they were in a position to launch their attack at 16:00 with the arrival of the 271st Brigade RFA. The fire from this artillery brigade dampened the hostile machine gun fire from Clay Hill, and at 15:50, 45 minutes after the 161st (Essex) Brigade joined the battle, the infantry succeeded in entering the defenders&#x27; trenches. They entered at two places to the east of the Ali Muntar mosque, capturing 20 German and Austrian soldiers and another 20 Ottoman soldiers. The 53rd (Welsh) Division reported the successful capture of Clay Hill, located within of Ali Muntar, at 16:45.

Meanwhile the attack by the Anzac Mounted Division, began twenty minutes ahead of schedule at 15:40, before all the patrols had been relieved by the Imperial Mounted Division. The Anzac Mounted Division was supported by the Leicester and Ayrshire artillery batteries, which came into action at ranges of between from their targets, respectively. Shortly after the attack began, Chetwode sent messages emphasising the importance of this attack, warning that the trench line northwest of Gaza between El Meshaheran and El Mineh on the sea, was strongly held and offering another brigade from the Imperial Mounted Division, which Chauvel accepted. Hodgson sent the 3rd Light Horse Brigade.

At 16:15, five minutes after the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade captured the Clay Hill redoubt near Ali Muntar, the attack on Gaza from the north by the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s 2nd Light Horse Brigade, supported by the Somerset artillery battery, had not been seriously engaged until they reached the cactus hedges. Here they were strongly resisted in close, intense fighting. The cactus hedges had forced the light horsemen to dismount, however, the assault soon developed and progress was rapid. The 2nd Light Horse Brigade was supported by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, which moved forward with the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment in advance, and the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment in support. However, only three troops of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment were in position, the remainder being delayed in the mounted screen, by strong hostile columns of reinforcements advancing from Huj and Nejed.

At 16:23, the high ridge east of Gaza was captured by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, while the 22nd Mounted Brigade on their left captured the knoll running west from the ridge. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade&#x27;s headquarters subsequently took up a position on the ridge, in an area later called &quot;Chaytor&#x27;s Hill&quot;. The Wellington and Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiments pressed on towards Gaza, supported by four machine guns attached to each regiment, the remaining four machine guns being held in reserve. Between 16:30 and 17:00, Ali Muntar was captured by the infantry and the dismounted New Zealanders. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment had pushed along &#x27;The Ridge&#x27; from the rear to assist in the attack, one squadron swinging south against Ali Muntar to enter the defenders&#x27; trenches just after the infantry.
By dusk the light horsemen had reached the northern and western outskirts of the town. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade&#x27;s dismounted fighters advanced from Jebaliye against the east and northeast of Gaza to assist in the capture of Ali Muntar, before pushing on through a very enclosed region. This area was intersected with cactus hedges, buildings, and rifle pits occupied by defending riflemen, who strongly resisted the attackers. Despite considerable opposition the New Zealanders continued to slowly advance through the orchards and cactus hedges to the outskirts of the town. During this advance, the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment captured two 77-mm Krupp guns with limbers and ammunition. Shortly afterwards, their progress was stopped by snipers in several houses on the eastern outskirts of the town. The Krupp guns were pushed forward to fire at point blank, blowing up several houses and causing the surrender of 20 hostile soldiers. Meanwhile, the 22nd Mounted Brigade, advancing at the gallop along the track from Beit Durdis to Gaza, had also reached the outskirts of the town by dusk.

By nightfall, the Anzac Mounted Division had fought their way into the streets of Gaza, suffering very few casualties during this advance. While the attack in the centre by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was progressing, the 22nd Mounted Brigade had come up on the New Zealanders&#x27; left, and it was this attacking force that entered the town. Meanwhile, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had met stiff resistance from defenders holding entrenchments in the sand hills to the northwest of the town. Closest to the Mediterranean coast, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) met considerable opposition, but was eventually able to advance close up to the town.
By 18:00, the position of the attacking force was most satisfactory, and by 18:30 the whole position had been captured, while the defenders were retreating into the town centre. The Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade were well into the northern outskirts of the town. Units of the 158th (North Wales) Brigade (53rd Division) and the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment held Ali Muntar, the 159th (Cheshire) Brigade&#x27;s right was holding trenches on Clay Hill, while its left was south of the town holding the Gaza to Beersheba road. The 161st (Essex) Brigade (54th Division) held Green Hill and the 160th Brigade (53rd Division) was holding a position to the north of the Labyrinth. By nightfall this combined force was consolidating its captured positions. Only on the western side of Gaza in the sand hills had the attack not been completely successful.

===Mounted screen attacked===

At 14:20 Hodgson ordered his Imperial Mounted Division to move north and take over the Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s outpost positions. The 6th Mounted Brigade was to move to the east of Beit Durdis, while the 5th Mounted Brigade, currently astride the Gaza to Beersheba road, was to &quot;fill the gap between it and the Camel Brigade,&quot; which had orders to move to Kh er Reseim. Owing to a delay in the Camel Brigade receiving its orders, this relief was not completed until two hours later, after 18:30 when the 5th Mounted Brigade moved north.

Meanwhile, the Ottoman Fourth Army&#x27;s 3rd and 16th Infantry Divisions prepared to launch a counterattack by 1,000 men advancing towards Gaza. The two divisions were expected to be in action before dark, but the EEF cavalry and armoured cars were able to stop their advance before they were halfway from Tel esh Sheria to Gaza. Kress von Kressenstein did not persist with the attack but ordered a renewal of their attacks at dawn. About 300 of these reinforcements had been seen at 15:50 (ten minutes after the combined attack on Gaza began) marching towards the town from the north. A little later three more columns were reported moving in the same direction, while another 300 soldiers had moved into the sand hills west of Deir Sineid, to the north of Gaza. A squadron from the 22nd Mounted Yeomanry Brigade was sent to oppose these forces.

From the east, units of the Ottoman Army had first been reported at 14:20, advancing from the direction of Jemmameh (east of Huj). When they were about from Beit Durdis, they attacked the Desert Column outposts holding Hill 405. Two squadrons and one troop of Berkshire Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) defended the front. They reported being attacked by infantry, mounted troops, and some machine gun crews. Hodgson ordered the remainder of brigade, supported by the Berkshire Battery RHA, to reinforce this outpost front line. However, the remainder of the 6th Mounted Brigade was in the process of watering and could not start at once. The delay allowed the Ottoman force to capture the crest of Hill 405 at 17:15.

At 17:00, Hodgson commanding the mounted screen, asked Chauvel commanding the mounted attack on Gaza, for reinforcements. Chauvel sent back the 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade), commanded by Brigadier General J. R. Royston. They moved back quickly under Royston&#x27;s command to capture a high hill northwest of Hill 405, which enabled the units of the Berkshire Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) to hold their position. The 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) with the 1/1st Queen&#x27;s Own Dorset Yeomanry (6th Mounted Brigade) held the line, while the 1/1st Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery and the Berkshire Battery enfiladed the advancing hostile formations. Six hostile guns in their firing line, returned fire. When three additional hostile batteries were brought forward, they enfiladed the Berkshire Battery, forcing it to withdraw at about 18:30, just before dusk.

After his divisional headquarters moved north, during his take over of the mounted screen, Hodgson discovered that he had lost contact with the 5th Mounted Brigade. It was nearly dark when, at 17:30, a gap occurred in the line between the 6th Mounted Brigade and Imperial Camel Brigade at Kh er Reseim. Fortunately, hostile soldiers did not attempt to investigate the area before Chauvel sent back his last divisional reserve, the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), to fill the gap. In the growing darkness the light horse regiment succeeded in reaching its position.

The No. 7 Light Car Patrol was sent to reinforce units holding off Ottoman reinforcements advancing from Deir Sineid at 17:15. They strengthened the original two squadrons of the 6th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) which held the main road to the north of Gaza. They had been joined by a squadron of the 22nd Mounted Brigade and two more squadrons of the 6th Light Horse Regiment. The Nos. 11 and 12 Light Armoured Motor Batteries (LAMB) also reinforced the mounted screen holding off, about 4,000 Ottoman soldiers advancing from the direction of Huj and Jemmameh. These Ottoman Army units were reported to be 3,000 infantry and two squadrons of cavalry. The LAMBs reported to Royston and engaged the Ottoman Army until dark.

===Withdrawal of mounted divisions===

During the battle the serious pressure from Ottoman forces advancing to relieve Gaza from the east had been expected and had begun to make an impact since 16:00. However, in view of the late start to the battle and the threat from these reinforcements, Dobell, the commander of Eastern Force, after talking with Chetwode, the commander of Desert Column, decided that unless Gaza was captured by nightfall, the fighting must stop and the mounted force withdrawn. By dusk, some of the strong Ottoman Army trenches and redoubts defending Gaza, remained in their control. The British had fired some 304 shells and 150,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, while their infantry casualties were substantial. On the day of battle, 26 March 1917, the sun set at 18:00 (Cairo time). This occurred before Desert Column knew of the capture of Ali Muntar. Therefore, with the approval of Dobell, at 18:10 Chetwode commanding Desert Column, ordered Chauvel to withdraw the mounted force and retire across the Wadi Ghuzzeh. As these orders were being dispatched, a report came in from Dallas that Ali Muntar had been captured, but this information did not change Chetwode&#x27;s mind. It was not until some time later that he was informed of the capture of the entire ridge. Chetwode&#x27;s orders were to break off the action after dark and withdraw.

According to Christopher Pugsley, the Anzac Mounted Division &quot;saw victory snatched away from them by the order to withdraw.&quot; This decision to withdraw was puzzling to many of those fighting in and near the town, as the infantry held Ali Muntar and 462 German and Ottoman army prisoners, including a general who was a divisional commander. They had also captured an Austrian battery of two Krupp 77 mm field guns, along with a complete convoy. However, the whole attacking force was withdrawn to Deir el Belah and Khan Yunus on 27 and 28 March. The first units to withdraw were the slow moving wheels and camels, which received their orders at 17:00 from Desert Column. They move back to Hill 310 via Sheikh Abbas. With the Imperial Mounted Division, remaining in position to cover the retirement of the Anzac Mounted Division, the withdrawal of the fighting mounted units was slow and difficult, not because of hostile pressure (there was none until dawn), but because the units were intermixed and the dismounted troops were far from their horses. One unit, the 7th Light Horse Regiment (2nd Light Horse Brigade) was nearly from their horses and all their wounded had not yet been collected. The No. 7 Light Car Patrol reported to the headquarters of the Anzac Mounted Division at 18:40 and was ordered to return to base, while the cars of the Nos. 11 and 12 LAMB, camped in the vicinity of Kh er Reseim. At 19:05 Anzac Mounted Division&#x27;s artillery began its retirement from divisional headquarters under escort, and the 43 wounded from the Anzac Mounted Division and 37 wounded from Imperial Mounted Division were collected and brought to the ambulances, while prisoners were sent back under escort. By 19:30 the 22nd Mounted Brigade was moving toward Divisional Headquarters and the 6th Mounted Brigade withdrew while Ottoman soldiers dug in on Hill 405.

At about midnight the Anzac Mounted Division was clear of the battlefield, while the Imperial Mounted Division, with the assistance of the Imperial Camel Brigade and armoured motor cars, held off the Ottoman reinforcements. At 02:00 when the guns of Anzac Mounted Division had reached Dier el Belah and the division was just passed Beit Dundis, Hodgson gave orders for the concentration of the Imperial Mounted Division&#x27;s 3rd Light Horse, 5th, and 6th Mounted Brigades, while the Imperial Camel Brigade took up a line from the Wadi Guzzeh to the left of the 54th (East Anglian) Division&#x27;s headquarters.

At 04:30, the cars in the Nos. 11 and 12 LAMB broke camp near Kh er Reseim, and as they moved southwards encountered opposition from Ottoman Army units. After two hours of stiff fighting they managed to retire, while at 04:50 the No. 7 Light Car Patrol was moving along the Gaza to Beersheba road. It was not until 05:30 that an Ottoman attack in strength fell on the rear of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade (Imperial Mounted Division) just as the brigade was crossing the Gaza-Beersheba road near Kh Sihan. The No. 7 Light Car Patrol gave very effective support to the brigade, and together with the light horsemen, became heavily engaged, fighting the Ottoman Army advancing from Huj. The advancing reinforcements were stopped, and the light cars covered the 3rd Light Horse Brigade&#x27;s retirement back to the Imperial Camel Brigade&#x27;s position, at 07:00 on the morning of 27 March 1917.

===Withdrawal of infantry===
At 17:38 Dobell commanding Eastern Force, ordered the 54th (East Anglian) Division to move to the west to Burjabye Ridge, and informed Desert Column. An hour later, at 18:35 (25 minutes after Chetwode ordered Chauvel to withdraw), Dobell informed Desert Column and the 54th (East Anglian) Division &quot;that he contemplated withdrawing the whole force across the Wadi Ghazze if Gaza did not shortly fall.&quot;

There have been claims that the infantry were the first to retire and that, due to a communications breakdown, the 53rd (Welsh) Division made a complete and premature retirement. However, that infantry division had not been told of the movement of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and was still in position. It was not until just before 19:00 that Chetwode phoned Dallas, commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, to inform him of the withdrawal of the mounted troops, and the need for him to move his right to reestablish contact with the 54th (East Anglian) Division. Dallas was under the impression that he was to move back to Sheikh Abbas, from his right on Clay Hill, while Chetwode meant that the two divisions would reconnect north of Mansura and not much over from the 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, at Green Hill. Dallas protested, instead asking for reinforcements to close the gap between the two divisions. This request was denied and when he prevaricated, asking for time to consider the order, Chetwode gave him the verbal order, believing the 53rd (Welsh) Division was moving its right back to gain touch with the 54th (East Anglian) Division near Mansura. Falls notes that according to Dallas &quot;he had explained on the telephone the full extent of his withdrawal to General Chetwode; the latter states that he did not understand his subordinate to mean that he was abandoning anything like so much ground. In any case the responsibility rests upon Desert Column Headquarters, since General Dallas had telegraphed to it the line he was taking up.&quot;

As late as 21:12, the 53rd (Welsh) Division still held Ali Muntar, at which time they advised Desert Column they would have to evacuate towards Sheikh Abbas, to conform with a withdrawal occurring on their right. At 22:30 Dallas, commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, issued orders for the whole of his force to withdraw to a line which stretched from the caves at Tell el Ujul, near the Wadi Ghuzzeh on the left through a point north of Esh Sheluf, and on to Mansura and Sheikh Abbas involving a retirement of on the Es Sire Ridge and between Clay Hill and Mansura. He informed Desert Column of this move. By 23:00, Dobell commanding Eastern Force, had become aware of the extent of the 53rd (Welsh) Division&#x27;s successes. He also received intercepted wireless messages, which had been unduly delayed, between Kress von Kressenstein at Tel esh Sheria and Major Tiller, the German officer commanding the Gaza garrison, indicating the desperate situation of the garrison. Dobell immediately ordered Chetwode and Dallas to dig in on their present line, connecting his right with the 54th (East Anglian) Division.

====Reoccupations and retreats====
It was nearly midnight when Dallas commanding 53rd (Welsh) Division, discovered the 54th (East Anglian) Division was moving towards the north of Mansura – had he known of this move at the time, he would not have abandoned all of the captured positions. At 05:00 on 27 March, when Chetwode learned that the 53rd (Welsh) Division had abandoned its entire position, and he ordered them back to Ali Muntar. Dallas ordered the 160th Brigade (53rd Division) and 161st (Essex) Brigades (54th Division) to push forward with strong patrols to the positions they had held on the previous evening. Both Green Hill and Ali Muntar were found to be unoccupied and one company of the 1/7th Battalion Essex Regiment, (161st Brigade) reoccupied Ali Muntar, while two companies of the same battalion reoccupied Green Hill. After the 2nd Battalion of the 10th Middlesex Regiment (160th Brigade) had pushed forward patrols beyond Sheluf, the 2nd Battalion of the 4th Royal West Surrey or 4th Royal West Kent Regiment (160th Brigade) was ordered to advance and &quot;gain touch&quot; with the 161st Brigade. However, as the battalion advanced in artillery formation, they could see the 161st Brigade to the northeast &quot;falling back.&quot; Meanwhile the 1/1st Battalion, Herefordshire Regiment (158th Brigade, 53rd Division) had also been ordered to reoccupy their brigade&#x27;s position and was advancing, when they too saw the 161st Brigade withdrawing.

After dawn on 27 March the first Ottoman counterattacks recaptured Ali Muntar and a portion of Green Hill, but the 1/7th Battalion of the Essex Regiment, (161st Brigade, 54th Division), retook the positions before consolidating and re-establishing their posts. Meanwhile, the Ottoman force, which had attacked the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, appeared on Sheikh Abbas and shelled the rear of Dallas&#x27; position, &quot;including his reserves, medical units and transport camels,&quot; but made no serious attack on the 54th (East Anglian) Division holding Burjabye Ridge. The hostile artillery batteries at Sheikh Abbas targeted all the tracks across the Wadi Ghuzzeh, employed by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, who were at the time attempting to supply food, water and ammunition, to the forward units. At 08:00 the 53rd (Welsh) Division came under orders of Eastern Force, and Dobell received an appreciation from Dallas at 09:15. This stated that if the present positions of the 53rd (Welsh) and 54th (East Anglian) Divisions were to be maintained, the German and Ottoman occupation of Sheikh Abbas must be ended. This was confirmed by G. P. Dawnay, Brigadier General General Staff (BGGS), Eastern Force. Dallas suggested Sheikh Abbas might best be recaptured by Desert Column, as the 52nd (Lowland) Division was too far away.

However, by 08:10 the Imperial Mounted Division had arrived back at Deir el Belah and the Anzac Mounted Division was marching via Abu Thirig past Hill 310 where Chauvel met Chetwode. Chetwode ordered the horses of both divisions to water and return to a position near El Dameita to support an attempt by the infantry to retake Ali Muntar. At 08:30 when the Anzac Mounted Division also arrived back at Deir el Belah, Chetwode took over command of the two mounted divisions from Chauvel. The Anzac Mounted Division returned to take up a position near El Dameita which it held until 16:00, while the 54th (East Anglian) Division remained near Sheikh Abbas engaging the advancing Ottoman units from Beersheba.

Ali Muntar, which had been held by two battalions of the Essex Regiment (54th Division), was strongly attacked, and at 09:30 the British infantry were forced to withdraw, having suffered severe losses. They fell back to Green Hill where they were almost surrounded, but managed to withdraw to a line south of Ali Muntar halfway between that hill and Sheluf. After first advising Murray, at 16:30 Dobell issued orders for the withdrawal to the left bank of the Wadi Ghuzzeh of the 53rd (Welsh) and the 54th (East Anglian) Divisions under the command of Dallas. This retirement, which began at 19:00, was completed without interference from the Ottoman Army. An aerial reconnaissance on the morning of 28 March reported that no Ottoman units were within range of the British guns. No large scale attacks were launched by either side, but very active aircraft bombings and artillery duels continued for a time.

===Casualties===

British casualties amounted to 4,000; 523 killed, 2932 wounded and over 512 missing, including five officers and 241 other ranks known to be prisoners. These were mainly from the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 161st (Essex) Brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division. The Ottoman Army forces suffered a total of 2,447 casualties. Of these, 16 Germans and Austrians were killed or wounded, 41 being reported missing, and 1,370 Ottoman soldiers were killed or wounded with 1,020 missing. According to Cemal Pasha, Ottoman losses amounted to fewer than 300 men killed, 750 wounded, and 600 missing. The Anzac Mounted Division suffered six killed, 43 or 46 wounded, and two missing, while the Imperial Mounted Division suffered 37 casualties.

==Aftermath==
Both Murray and Dobell portrayed the battle as a success, Murray sending the following message to the War Office on 28 March: &quot;We have advanced our troops a distance of fifteen miles from Rafa to the Wadi Ghuzzee, five miles west of Gaza, to cover the construction of the railway. On the 26th and 27th we were heavily engaged east of Gaza with a force of about 20,000 of the enemy. We inflicted very heavy losses upon him ... All troops behaved splendidly.&quot; And Dobell wrote, 

The British press reported the battle as a success, but an Ottoman plane dropped a message that said, &quot;You beat us at communiqués, but we beat you at Gaza.&quot; Dallas, the commander of the 53rd (Welsh) Division, resigned after the battle, owing to a &quot;breakdown in health.&quot; Judged by Western Front standards, the defeat was small and not very costly. Murray&#x27;s offensive power had not been greatly affected and preparations for a renewal of the offensive were quickly begun. The Second Battle of Gaza began on 17 April 1917.

A report in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said on 26 March that British troops were severely delayed until early afternoon by a dense morning fog, during which delay they drank much of their water rations, leaving the men short of water; and that the main aim was to seize the Wadi Ghuzzeh to cover the advance of a supply railway which the British were building.

<text>Earl of Meath is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1627 and is held by the head of the Brabazon family.

==History==
The Brabazon family descends from Sir Edward Brabazon, who represented County Wicklow in the Irish House of Commons and served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1606. He was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Ardee in 1616. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He was created Earl of Meath in the Peerage of Ireland in 1627, with remainder to his younger brother, the Hon. Sir Anthony Brabazon. Lord Meath was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. His grandson, the fourth Earl, served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin and of Kildare. His wife Dorothy Stopford, daughter of James Stopford and Mary Forth, was a close friend of Jonathan Swift. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was also Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin. He married the Hon. Juliana Chaworth, daughter of Patrick Chaworth, 3rd and last Viscount Chaworth.

Upon the death of the fifth Earl, the titles passed to his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin and County Kildare. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. His grandson, the ninth Earl, was killed in a duel in 1797. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of Dublin from 1831 to 1851. The Chaworth title held by his ancestors was revived in 1831 when he was created Baron Chaworth, of Eaton Hall in the County of Hereford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His son, the eleventh Earl, sat as MP for County Dublin from 1830 to 1832, and from 1837 to 1841, and was also Lord-Lieutenant of County Wicklow from 1869 to 1887. He was succeeded by his son, the twelfth Earl. He was a politician and philanthropist. His son, the thirteenth Earl, was a Brigadier-General in the Grenadier Guards and the Irish Guards. , the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifteenth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1998.

The Hon. William Brabazon, of Tara House in County Meath, younger son of the seventh Earl, was the father of Barbara, who married John Moore. Their grandson John Arthur Henry Moore assumed the additional surname of Brabazon and was the father of the aviation pioneer and Conservative politician John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara. (See Baron Brabazon of Tara for more information on this branch of the family.)

The family seat is Kilruddery House, near Bray in County Wicklow.

<text>The Des Moines River () is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the upper Midwestern United States that is approximately long from its farther headwaters. The largest river flowing across the state of Iowa, it rises in southern Minnesota and flows across Iowa from northwest to southeast, passing from the glaciated plains into the unglaciated hills, transitioning near the capital city of Des Moines in the center of the state. The river continues to flow in a southeastern direction away from Des Moines, flowing directly into the Mississippi River. The Des Moines River forms a short portion of Iowa&#x27;s border with Missouri between Lee County, Iowa and Clark County, Missouri.

The city of Des Moines, Iowa, was named for the river.

==Hydrography==
In Minnesota, the upper forks of the Des Moines River drain the plateau and moraines between the Coteau des Prairies to the west, which is drained by the Big Sioux River, and the lower lands to the east which drain northward into the Blue Earth and Minnesota Rivers.

The Des Moines River rises in two forks. The West Fork (the main branch) rises out of the wetlands surrounding Lake Yankton and Long Lake in Lyon County in southwestern Minnesota. The small stream flows southwest into Lake Shetek, then through Windom and Jackson, Minnesota, and near Estherville, Iowa. The East Fork rises out in rural Martin County, Minnesota, just north of Interstate 90. It then flows through Okamanpeedan Lake on the Iowa-Minnesota border, then south, through Algona. The two forks join in southern Humboldt County, approximately 5 miles (8 km) south of Humboldt at Frank Gotch State Park.

The combined stream flows roughly southward through Fort Dodge. South of Boone it passes through the Ledges State Park. It flows through downtown Des Moines, then turns generally southeastward, flowing through Ottumwa. It forms approximately 20 miles (32 km) of the border between Iowa and Missouri before joining the Mississippi from the northwest at Keokuk.

It receives the Boone River from the northeast approximately 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Fort Dodge. It receives the Raccoon River from the west in the city of Des Moines. Above the city of Des Moines, it is impounded to create the Saylorville Lake reservoir. About midway below Saylorville and above Ottumwa, near Pella, the river is impounded to create the Lake Red Rock reservoir.

==History==
 One of the earliest French maps that depicts the Des Moines (1703) refers to it as &quot;R. des Otentas,&quot; which translates to &quot;River of the Otoe&quot;; the Otoe Tribe lived in the interior of Iowa in the 18th century. The Meskwaki and Sauk people referred to the river as &quot;&quot;Ke-o-shaw-qua&quot; (Hermit&#x27;s River), from which Keosauqua, Iowa, derives its name. The Dakota Indians, who lived near its headwaters in present-day Minnesota, referred to it as &quot;Inyan Shasha&quot; in their Siouan language. Another Siouan name was &quot;Eah-sha-wa-pa-ta,&quot;&quot; or &quot;Red Stone&quot; river, possibly referring to the bluffs at Red Rock or the reddish Sioux Quartzite bedrock near its headwaters.

The origin of the name &quot;Des Moines&quot; is obscure. Early French explorers named it &quot;La Rivière des Moines&quot;, literally meaning &quot;River of the Monks.&quot; The name may have referred to early Trappist monks who built huts near the mouth of the river at the Mississippi.

William Bright writes that &quot;Moines&quot; was an abbreviation used by the French for &quot;Moingouena&quot; or &quot;Moingona&quot;, an Algonquian subgroup of the Illinois people. The Native American term was &quot;/mooyiinkweena/&quot;, a derogatory name applied to the Moingouena by the Peoria people, a closely related subgroup. The meaning of the native word, according to an early French writer, is &quot;visage plein d&#x27;ordure&quot;, or in plain English, &quot;shit-face&quot;, from &quot;mooy-&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;-iinkwee&quot;, &quot;face&quot;, and &quot;-na&quot;, &quot;indefinite actor&quot;.

The 1718 Guillaume Delisle map (pictured) labels it as &quot;le Moingona R.&quot;

During the mid-19th century, the river supported the main commercial transportation by water across Iowa. River traffic began to be superseded by the railroads constructed from the 1860s.

==Flooding==

Catastrophic flooding occurred along the Des Moines River during the Great Flood of 1851, nearly destroying the new town of Des Moines. Residents had never previously experienced a major flood, and river towns lacked levees and substantial bridges that could withstand flooding. In 1851, 74.5 in (191.5 cm) of rain fell in Iowa, a record that holds to this day. The worst flooding occurred May to June in the Des Moines River Basin. Major flooding in 1851 occurred in Bentonsport, Croton, Bonaparte, Des Moines, Eddyville, Farmington, Iowaville, Keosauqua, Muscatine, Oskaloosa, Ottumwa and Rochester.

The river has a history of seasonal flooding. For example, in May 1944 the Riverview Park had just opened for the season on May 19, 1944. At around dawn on May 23, the levee began to collapse. The river was too much to hold back. Quickly the breach in the levee grew to nearly wide, and the river water quickly enveloped all of the park and the surrounding area.

The Great Flood of 1993 on the river and its tributary the Raccoon, in the summer of 1993, forced the evacuation of much of the city of Des Moines and nearby communities.

<text>The Skunk River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the state of Iowa in the United States.

==Geography==
The Skunk River rises in two branches, the South Skunk ( long) and the North Skunk ( long). The headwaters of the South Skunk are in Hamilton County in north central Iowa. It flows roughly due southward, to the west of Interstate 35, and passes through the city of Ames, before turning southeasterly. In Keokuk County, it is joined by the North Skunk, which has its headwaters in Marshall County. It then proceeds southeastward and flows into the Mississippi about five miles south of the city of Burlington.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources has designated 33 miles of the Skunk River as a State Water Trail since 2020. 

==Etymology==
The Sauk and Meskwaki referred to the Skunk River as &quot;Shecaqua&quot;. This name was probably mistranslated; one early settler wrote, &quot;I was informed by Frank Labisner, United States interpreter for the Sac and Fox Indians, that the name of Skunk River was a wrong interpretation. The Indian name was Checaqua. Which, in their language is anything of a strong or obnoxious smell, such as onions. I think, that from the fact that the head waters of the stream abounded with wild onions, the interpretation should be &#x27;Onion.&#x27;&quot; This origin makes the river&#x27;s native name a cognate of the name &quot;Chicago&quot;, the Miami-Illinois name for the wild onion.

==Habitat==
Species of fish found in the Skunk River include smallmouth bass, gar, walleye, catfish, carp, bluegill, sheephead, bullhead, and largemouth bass, crappie, sunfish.

The river features an abundance of birds, deer, beaver, wood ducks, and raccoons. The Skunk River is lined with silver maples, sycamores, cottonwoods, and oaks along the shoreline. 

The &quot;Skunk River Navy&quot; was founded and led by Iowa State University biology professor &#x27;Admiral&#x27; Jim Colbert and biology advisor &#x27;Admiral&#x27; Jim Holtz. The SRN operated from August 1998 to September 2017. The SRN focused on monitoring the biological diversity of the South Skunk River, and some of its tributaries, near Ames, Iowa as well as removal of trash from these streams. Participation in the SRN was primarily focused on students entering Iowa State in the biology major, though students in other majors, other ISU personnel, as well as other individuals participated. During the years of operation of the SRN approximately 2,400 volunteers participated and over 80 tons of trash were removed from the South Skunk River and some of its tributaries. The SRN also found, and reported, diesel fuel and sewage leaks into the South Skunk River, and its tributary Ioway Creek, respectively. These leaks were repaired by the City of Ames. Beginning in 2018 local paddling groups may use the name &quot;Skunk River Navy&quot;, but the SRN is no longer under the auspices of the ISU Biology Program.

<text>J&#x27;ouvert ( ) (also Jour ouvert, Jouvay, or Jouvé) is a traditional Carnival celebration in many countries throughout the Caribbean. The parade is believed to have its foundation in Trinidad &amp; Tobago, with roots steeped in French Afro-Creole traditions such as Canboulay. J&#x27;ouvert typically begins in the early morning, before dawn, and peaks by mid-morning. The celebration involves calypso or soca bands, DJs, and their followers dancing through the streets. In many countries, revelers cover their bodies in paint, mud, or pitch oil. Today J&#x27;ouvert is also a part of Carnival celebrations outside of the Caribbean, with the biggest celebrations happening in cities with large Caribbean ex-pat communities.

== Etymology ==
&quot;J&#x27;ouvert&quot; is a gallicization of &quot;jou ouvè&quot; (; &quot;jour ouvert&quot; in standard French), the French Creole term meaning &quot;dawn&quot; or &quot;daybreak&quot;, as this is the time at which the celebration is typically held.

==History==
The origins of J&#x27;ouvert can be traced back to Trinidad. French traditions from the island&#x27;s original Carnival, African and Afro-Trinidadian traditions from Canboulay, and various social and political influences maybe have all played a role in shaping J&#x27;ouvert.

=== Trinidad&#x27;s Carnival ===
J&#x27;ouvert&#x27;s is rooted in the history of Carnival in Trinidad. The French brought Carnival to Trinidad in the 1780s, a time of slavery. Their pre-lenten Carnival included hunting parties, dinners, balls, and masquerading. Enslaved Africans, who were banned from participating in Carnival, are said to have staged their own mini-carnivals, but using their own rituals and folklore and imitating or mocking their masters&#x27; masquerade balls. These imitation carnivals and mocking of the ruling class likely gave rise to J&#x27;ouvert traditions, as parodying of the upper class is an important aspect of J&#x27;ouvert tradition. Alternatively, J&#x27;ouvert masquerading traditions may come from directly a French Carnival tradition that took the form of &quot;after-dinner raids on private homes&quot;. Friendly raiders would disguise themselves in humorous costumes that were often topical, parodying political or social events, and would remain disguised until their identities were guessed correctly. Costumes with political and social commentary are still seen in J&#x27;ouvert today.

=== Canboulay ===
Before Emancipation, enslaved Africans in Trinidad had celebrated Canboulay, a night-time harvest festival characterized by drums, singing, calinda dancing, chanting, and stick-fighting. The term &quot;Canboulay&quot; comes from the French &quot;cannes broullee&quot;, meaning &quot;burnt cane&quot;. It may refer to the putting out of cane fires, the pre-harvest cane burning for pest control, or the burning of cane as an act of sabotage during the time of slavery. Slavery was abolished in Trinidad and other British territories in 1833, with Emancipation taking effect 1 August 1834. After Emancipation, Canboulay developed into a festival for freed slaves and former indentured laborers to celebrate freedom. It was celebrated annually on Emancipation Day.

In 1881, the British colonial government on Trinidad attempted to ban Canboulay. This resulted in disturbances known as the Camboulay Riots, which took place in Port of Spain, San Fernando, and Princes Town. It is said that people smeared themselves with oil or paint to avoid being recognized, or may have been covered in black soot from burning cane. Today, covering bodies in oil, paint, or other substances is a distinctive tradition of J&#x27;ouvert. This tradition was likely carried forward in remembrance of the Canboulay Riots.

=== Peace Preservation Act ===
In 1884, the colonial government passed the Peace Preservation Act, which prohibited public carrying of torches, drumming, blowing horns, and stick-fighting (or the assembly of ten or more people with sticks). Many J&#x27;ouvert traditions may come from reactions to the prohibitions of the Peace Preservation Act. For instance, tamboo bamboo was introduced in the late 1880s as substitute for the drums and sticks. Tamboo bamboo bands developed and became the primary percussion instrument of Carnival. Additional instruments were developed to replace the banned drums, and percussion was achieve through use of metal and other items as well. The history of J&#x27;ouvert&#x27;s improvised instruments is celebrated today with the use of whistles, cowbells, bottles, and home-made instruments.

The Peace Preservation Act also established the official start of Carnival as 6:00 A.M. This likely explains the early-morning start time of J&#x27;ouvert. Canboulay had traditionally been a nighttime celebration, but after the Peace Preservation Act effectively banned Canboulay, Afro-Trinidadians began celebrating a reinterpretation of Canboulay beginning at 6:00 A.M. on Carnival Monday. Some historians claim that revelers took advantage of the pre-dawn darkness and began festivities before 6:00 A.M.—and that this secret and rebellious celebration is the origin of J&#x27;ouvert. Today, J&#x27;ouvert in the Caribbean typically begins before dawn.

=== Other origins ===
The pre-dawn tradition of J&#x27;ouvert may have roots in Caribbean folklore. For instance, there is a local Trinidadian legend about a soucouyant, who sheds her skin at night and consumes the blood of her victims. She must reenter her skin before dawn, but is unable to do so if someone sprinkles salt on her skin. According to legend, she will cry out &quot;&quot;Jouvay, jou paka ouvay&quot;?&quot; (&quot;Daybreak, are you coming?) as dawn approaches.

=== J&#x27;ouvert in the Caribbean ===
J&#x27;ouvert traditionally begins between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. and continues until mid-morning. In The Bahamas, however, J&#x27;ouvert Bahamas begins at night and goes until the early hours of the morning. In some West Indian countries, J&#x27;ouvert is celebrated on Emancipation Day (the first day of August). In Trinidad, J&#x27;ouvert takes place on Carnival Monday, which in Trinidad is the Monday morning before Ash Wednesday. Other islands celebrate J&#x27;ouvert on Carnival Monday as well, the date of which depends on their island&#x27;s Carnival dates.

Participants follow and dance behind trucks or tractor-trailers, which play music from speakers or have live music. In Trinidad, Grenada, and Antigua, a part of the tradition involves covering the body in oil, mud, or chocolate. On other island, colored paints and power are more popular for covering the clothes or body. Throughout the Caribbean, many J&#x27;ouvert revelers wear traditional, satirical, or popular costumes. In Trinidad and Grenada, &quot;Jab Jabs&quot; (from the French &quot;diable,&quot; meaning &quot;devil&quot;) dress as devils of different colors, and &quot;Jab Molassi&quot; (molasses devil) cover their bodies in oil from head to toe. By contrast, in Aruba J&#x27;ouvert is referred to as the &quot;pajama party parade,&quot; as people can join wearing comfortable, regular clothes rather than dressing up in costume.

In many West Indian countries, J&#x27;ouvert is observed before the daytime Carnival Mas or &quot;Pretty Mas&quot;. Pretty Mas is the Carnival parade featuring colorful costumes which are often made of feathers, beads, gem stones, brightly coloured fabrics, glitter and other elaborate body adornments and is more popular while commercially publicized. J&#x27;ouvert uses the rebellious nature of powder, mud and oil, while Pretty Mas celebrates the abstract allure of glitter, colour and light. J&#x27;ouvert is often contrasted with Pretty Mas, in that J&#x27;ouvert is said to be for &quot;the people&quot; while Pretty Mas is intended for the establishment.

=== J&#x27;ouvert in Brooklyn ===
Brooklyn is home to the largest West Indian population outside the Caribbean, and began its own Carnival celebration in the late 1960s. Organized by the West Indian American Day Carnival Association (WIADCA), the West Indian Day Parade is held annually on Labor Day Monday. The event attracts millions of participants who parade down central Brooklyn&#x27;s Eastern Parkway. An early morning J&#x27;ouvert component was added to the celebration in the 1990s when steel pan player Earl King and community organizer Yvette Rennie formed J&#x27;ouvert City International. Featuring traditional steelbands (DJs and sound systems prohibited) and ole mas costumes, the Brooklyn J&#x27;ouvert attracts tens of thousands Carnival enthusiasts.

=== J&#x27;ouvert in London ===
J&#x27;ouvert marks the start of London&#x27;s Notting Hill Carnival, one of the biggest street festivals in the world. The J&#x27;ouvert event typically starts at 6:00 a.m. and takes place in the streets of Notting Hill. Revelers cover themselves in colored powder, oil, or paint, and others dress in elaborate costumes. The celebration involves multiple hours of music and dancing.

=== J&#x27;ouvert in Toronto ===

The Toronto Caribbean Carnival is held each summer in Toronto, Ontario, and features a pre-dawn J&#x27;ouvert celebration. Unlike J&#x27;ouvert of the Caribbean, Toronto&#x27;s J&#x27;ouvert often takes place at an outdoor venue rather than in the streets as a parade. The celebration usually features steelpan bands, other live music, DJs, as well as revelers using improvised musical instruments, whistles, and other music makers. Participants will occasionally cover themselves with mud, flour, baby powder, or paint. Some participants dress to resemble evil spirits, such as devils of different colors, including the &quot;Jab Jab&quot;.

<text>Secret sharing (also called secret splitting) refers to methods for distributing a secret among a group, in such a way that no individual holds any intelligible information about the secret, but when a sufficient number of individuals combine their &#x27;shares&#x27;, the secret may be reconstructed. Whereas &quot;insecure&quot; secret sharing allows an attacker to gain more information with each share, &quot;secure&quot; secret sharing is &#x27;all or nothing&#x27; (where &#x27;all&#x27; means the necessary number of shares).

In one type of secret sharing scheme there is one &quot;dealer&quot; and &quot;n&quot; &quot;players&quot;. The dealer gives a share of the secret to the players, but only when specific conditions are fulfilled will the players be able to reconstruct the secret from their shares. The dealer accomplishes this by giving each player a share in such a way that any group of &quot;t&quot; (for &quot;threshold&quot;) or more players can together reconstruct the secret but no group of fewer than &quot;t&quot; players can. Such a system is called a -threshold scheme (sometimes it is written as an -threshold scheme).

Secret sharing was invented independently by Adi Shamir and George Blakley in 1979.
==Importance==

Secret sharing schemes are ideal for storing information that is highly sensitive and highly important. Examples include: encryption keys, missile launch codes, and numbered bank accounts. Each of these pieces of information must be kept highly confidential, as their exposure could be disastrous; however, it is also critical that they should not be lost. Traditional methods for encryption are ill-suited for simultaneously achieving high levels of confidentiality and reliability. This is because when storing the encryption key, one must choose between keeping a single copy of the key in one location for maximum secrecy, or keeping multiple copies of the key in different locations for greater reliability. Increasing reliability of the key by storing multiple copies lowers confidentiality by creating additional attack vectors; there are more opportunities for a copy to fall into the wrong hands. Secret sharing schemes address this problem, and allow arbitrarily high levels of confidentiality and reliability to be achieved.

Secret sharing also allows the distributor of the secret to trust a group &#x27;in aggregate&#x27;. Traditionally, giving a secret to a group for safekeeping would require that the distributor completely trust all members of the group. Secret sharing schemes allow the distributor to securely store the secret with the group even if not all members can be trusted all the time. So long as the number of traitors is never more than the critical number needed to reconstruct the secret, the secret is safe.

Secret sharing schemes are important in cloud computing environments. Thus a key can be distributed over many servers by a threshold secret sharing mechanism. The key is then reconstructed when needed.

Secret sharing has also been suggested for sensor networks where the links are liable to be tapped, by sending the data in shares which makes the task of the eavesdropper harder. The security in such environments can be made greater by continuous changing of the way the shares are constructed.

== &quot;Secure&quot; versus &quot;insecure&quot; secret sharing ==
A secure secret sharing scheme distributes shares so that anyone with fewer than &quot;t&quot; shares has no more information about the secret than someone with 0 shares.

Consider for example the secret sharing scheme in which the secret phrase &quot;password&quot; is divided into the shares &quot;pa––––––&quot;, &quot;––ss––––&quot;, &quot;––––wo––&quot;, and &quot;––––––rd&quot;. A person with 0 shares knows only that the password consists of eight letters, and thus would have to guess the password from 268 = 208 billion possible combinations. A person with one share, however, would have to guess only the six letters, from 266 = 308 million combinations, and so on as more persons collude. Consequently, this system is not a &quot;secure&quot; secret sharing scheme, because a player with fewer than &quot;t&quot; secret shares is able to reduce the problem of obtaining the inner secret without first needing to obtain all of the necessary shares.

In contrast, consider the secret sharing scheme where &quot;X&quot; is the secret to be shared, &quot;Pi&quot; are public asymmetric encryption keys and &quot;Qi&quot; their corresponding private keys. Each player &quot;J&quot; is provided with In this scheme, any player with private key 1 can remove the outer layer of encryption, a player with keys 1 and 2 can remove the first and second layer, and so on. A player with fewer than &quot;N&quot; keys can never fully reach the secret &quot;X&quot; without first needing to decrypt a public-key-encrypted blob for which he does not have the corresponding private key – a problem that is currently believed to be computationally infeasible. Additionally we can see that any user with all &quot;N&quot; private keys is able to decrypt all of the outer layers to obtain &quot;X&quot;, the secret, and consequently this system is a secure secret distribution system.

==Limitations==
Several secret-sharing schemes are said to be information-theoretically secure and can be proven to be so, while others give up this &quot;unconditional security&quot; for improved efficiency while maintaining enough security to be considered as secure as other common cryptographic primitives. For example, they might allow secrets to be protected by shares with entropy of 128 bits each, since each share would be considered enough to stymie any conceivable present-day adversary, requiring a brute force attack of average size 2127.

Common to all unconditionally secure secret sharing schemes, there are limitations:
* Each share of the secret must be at least as large as the secret itself. This result is based in information theory, but can be understood intuitively. Given shares, no information whatsoever can be determined about the secret. Thus, the final share must contain as much information as the secret itself. There is sometimes a workaround for this limitation by first compressing the secret before sharing it, but this is often not possible because many secrets (keys for example) look like high-quality random data and thus are hard to compress.
* All secret-sharing schemes use random bits for constructing the shares. To distribute a one-bit secret shares with a threshold of &quot;t&quot; shares, random bits are needed. To distribute a secret of &quot;b&quot; bits, entropy of bits is necessary.

==Trivial secret sharing==
Note: &quot;n&quot; is the total number of &#x27;players&#x27;, among whom the shares are distributed, and &quot;t&quot; is the minimum number of players required to reveal the secret.

=== &quot;t&quot; = 1 ===
&quot;t&quot; = 1 secret sharing is trivial. The secret can simply be distributed to all &quot;n&quot; participants.

=== &quot;t&quot; = &quot;n&quot; ===
There are several secret-sharing schemes for , when all shares are necessary to recover the secret:

# Encode the secret as a binary number &quot;s&quot; of any length. For each player &quot;i&quot;, where &quot;i&quot; is one fewer than the total number of players, give a random binary number &quot;pi&quot; of the same length as &quot;s&quot;. To the player without a share, give the share calculated as , where ⊕ denotes bitwise exclusive or. The secret is the bitwise exclusive-or of all the players&#x27; numbers (&quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;).
# Instead, (1) can be performed using the binary operation in any group. For example, take the cyclic group of integers with addition modulo 232, which corresponds to 32-bit integers with addition defined with the binary overflow being discarded. The secret &quot;s&quot; can be partitioned into a vector of &quot;M&quot; 32-bit integers, which we call &quot;v&quot;secret. Then of the players are each given a vector of &quot;M&quot; 32-bit integers that is drawn independently from a uniform probability distribution, with player &quot;i&quot; receiving &quot;vi&quot;. The remaining player is given &quot;vn&quot; = &quot;v&quot;secret − &quot;v&quot;1 − &quot;v&quot;2 − ... − &quot;v&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1. The secret vector can then be recovered by summing across all the players&#x27; vectors.

=== 1 &lt; &quot;t&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; ===
The difficulty lies in creating schemes that are still secure, but do not require all &quot;n&quot; shares.

When space efficiency is not a concern, trivial schemes can be used to reveal a secret to any desired subsets of the players simply by applying the scheme for each subset. For example, to reveal a secret &quot;s&quot; to any two of the three players Alice, Bob and Carol, create three (formula_1) different secret shares for &quot;s&quot;, giving the three sets of two shares to Alice and Bob, Alice and Carol, and Bob and Carol.

=== &quot;t&quot; belonging to any desired subset of {1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;} ===
For example, imagine that the board of directors of a company would like to protect their secret formula. The president of the company should be able to access the formula when needed, but in an emergency any 3 of the 12 board members would be able to unlock the secret formula together. One of the ways this can be accomplished is by a secret-sharing scheme with and , where 3 shares are given to the president, and one share is given to each board member.

== Efficient secret sharing ==
The trivial approach quickly becomes impractical as the number of subsets increases, for example when revealing a secret to any 50 of 100 players, which would require formula_2 schemes to be created and each player to maintain formula_3 distinct sets of shares for each scheme. In the worst case, the increase is exponential. This has led to the search for schemes that allow secrets to be shared efficiently with a threshold of players.

===Shamir&#x27;s scheme===
In this scheme, any &quot;t&quot; out of &quot;n&quot; shares may be used to recover the secret. The system relies on the idea that one can construct a unique polynomial of degree , such that each of the &quot;t&quot; points lies on the polynomial. It takes two points to define a straight line, three points to fully define a quadratic, four points to define a cubic curve, and so on. That is, it takes &quot;t&quot; points to define a polynomial of degree . The method is to create a polynomial of degree with the secret as the first coefficient and the remaining coefficients picked at random. Next find &quot;n&quot; points on the curve and give one to each of the players. When at least &quot;t&quot; out of the &quot;n&quot; players reveal their points, there is sufficient information to fit a th degree polynomial to them, the first coefficient being the secret.

===Blakley&#x27;s scheme===
Two nonparallel lines in the same plane intersect at exactly one point. Three nonparallel planes in space intersect at exactly one point. More generally, any &quot;n&quot; nonparallel -dimensional hyperplanes intersect at a specific point. The secret may be encoded as any single coordinate of the point of intersection. If the secret is encoded using all the coordinates, even if they are random, then an insider (someone in possession of one or more of the -dimensional hyperplanes) gains information about the secret since he knows it must lie on his plane. If an insider can gain any more knowledge about the secret than an outsider can, then the system no longer has information theoretic security. If only one of the &quot;n&quot; coordinates is used, then the insider knows no more than an outsider (i.e., that the secret must lie on the &quot;x&quot;-axis for a 2-dimensional system). Each player is given enough information to define a hyperplane; the secret is recovered by calculating the planes&#x27; point of intersection and then taking a specified coordinate of that intersection.

Blakley&#x27;s scheme is less space-efficient than Shamir&#x27;s; while Shamir&#x27;s shares are each only as large as the original secret, Blakley&#x27;s shares are &quot;t&quot; times larger, where &quot;t&quot; is the threshold number of players. Blakley&#x27;s scheme can be tightened by adding restrictions on which planes are usable as shares. The resulting scheme is equivalent to Shamir&#x27;s polynomial system.

=== Using the Chinese remainder theorem ===
The Chinese remainder theorem can also be used in secret sharing, for it provides us with a method to uniquely determine a number &quot;S&quot; modulo &quot;k&quot; many pairwise coprime integers formula_4, given that formula_5. There are two secret sharing schemes that make use of the Chinese remainder theorem, Mignotte&#x27;s and Asmuth-Bloom&#x27;s Schemes. They are threshold secret sharing schemes, in which the shares are generated by reduction modulo the integers formula_6, and the secret is recovered by essentially solving the system of congruences using the Chinese remainder theorem.

==Proactive secret sharing==

If the players store their shares on insecure computer servers, an attacker could crack in and steal the shares. If it is not practical to change the secret, the uncompromised (Shamir-style) shares can be renewed. The dealer generates a new random polynomial with constant term zero and calculates for each remaining player a new ordered pair, where the x-coordinates of the old and new pairs are the same. Each player then adds the old and new y-coordinates to each other and keeps the result as the new y-coordinate of the secret.

All of the non-updated shares the attacker accumulated become useless. An attacker can only recover the secret if he can find enough other non-updated shares to reach the threshold. This situation should not happen because the players deleted their old shares. Additionally, an attacker cannot recover any information about the original secret from the update files because they contain only random information.

The dealer can change the threshold number while distributing updates, but must always remain vigilant of players keeping expired shares.

==Verifiable secret sharing==
A player might lie about his own share to gain access to other shares. A &quot;verifiable secret sharing&quot; (VSS) scheme allows players to be certain that no other players are lying about the contents of their shares, up to a reasonable probability of error. Such schemes cannot be computed conventionally; the players must collectively add and multiply numbers without any individual&#x27;s knowing what exactly is being added and multiplied. Tal Rabin and Michael Ben-Or devised a &quot;multiparty computing (MPC)&quot; system that allows players to detect dishonesty on the part of the dealer or on part of up to one third of the threshold number of players, even if those players are coordinated by an &quot;adaptive&quot; attacker who can change strategies in realtime depending on what information has been revealed.

==Computationally secure secret sharing==

The disadvantage of unconditionally secure secret sharing schemes is that the storage and transmission of the shares requires an amount of storage and bandwidth resources equivalent to the size of the secret times the number of shares. If the size of the secret were significant, say 1 GB, and the number of shares were 10, then 10 GB of data must be stored by the shareholders. Alternate techniques have been proposed for greatly increasing the efficiency of secret sharing schemes, by giving up the requirement of unconditional security.

One of these techniques, known as &quot;secret sharing made short&quot;, combines Rabin&#x27;s information dispersal algorithm (IDA) with Shamir&#x27;s secret sharing. Data is first encrypted with a randomly generated key, using a symmetric encryption algorithm. Next this data is split into N pieces using Rabin&#x27;s IDA. This IDA is configured with a threshold, in a manner similar to secret sharing schemes, but unlike secret sharing schemes the size of the resulting data grows by a factor of (number of fragments / threshold). For example, if the threshold were 10, and the number of IDA-produced fragments were 15, the total size of all the fragments would be (15/10) or 1.5 times the size of the original input. In this case, this scheme is 10 times more efficient than if Shamir&#x27;s scheme had been applied directly on the data. The final step in secret sharing made short is to use Shamir secret sharing to produce shares of the randomly generated symmetric key (which is typically on the order of 16–32 bytes) and then give one share and one fragment to each shareholder.

A related approach, known as AONT-RS, applies an All-or-nothing transform to the data as a pre-processing step to an IDA. The All-or-nothing transform guarantees that any number of shares less than the threshold is insufficient to decrypt the data.

==Multi-secret and space efficient (batched) secret sharing==
An information-theoretically secure &quot;k&quot;-of-&quot;n&quot; secret-sharing scheme generates &quot;n&quot; shares, each of size at least that of the secret itself, leading to the total required storage being at least &quot;n&quot;-fold larger than the secret. In multi-secret sharing designed by Matthew K. Franklin and Moti Yung, multiple points of the polynomial host secrets; the method was found useful in numerous applications from coding to multi-party computations. In space efficient secret sharing, devised by Abhishek Parakh and Subhash Kak, each share is roughly the size of the secret divided by .

This scheme makes use of repeated polynomial interpolation and has potential applications in secure information dispersal on the Web and in
sensor networks. This method is based on data partitioning involving the roots of a polynomial in finite field. Some vulnerabilities of related &quot;space efficient&quot; secret sharing schemes were pointed out later. They show that a scheme based on interpolation method cannot be used to implement a scheme when the &quot;k&quot; secrets to be distributed are inherently generated from a polynomial of degree less than , and the scheme does not work if all of the secrets to be shared are the same, etc.

==Other uses and applications==
A secret-sharing scheme can secure a secret over multiple servers and remain recoverable despite multiple server failures. The dealer may act as several distinct participants, distributing the shares among the participants. Each share may be stored on a different server, but the dealer can recover the secret even if several servers break down as long as they can recover at least &quot;t&quot; shares; however, crackers that break into one server would still not know the secret as long as fewer than &quot;t&quot; shares are stored on each server.

This is one of the major concepts behind the Vanish computer project at the University of Washington, where a random key is used to encrypt data, and the key is distributed as a secret across several nodes in a P2P network. In order to decrypt the message, at least &quot;t&quot; nodes on the network must be accessible; the principle for this particular project being that the number of secret-sharing nodes on the network will decrease naturally over time, therefore causing the secret to eventually &quot;vanish&quot;. However, the network is vulnerable to a Sybil attack, thus making Vanish insecure.

Any shareholder who ever has enough information to decrypt the content at any point is able to take and store a copy of X. Consequently, although tools and techniques such as Vanish can make data irrecoverable within their own system after a time, it is not possible to force the deletion of data once a malicious user has seen it. This is one of the leading conundrums of digital rights management.

A dealer could send &quot;t&quot; shares, all of which are necessary to recover the original secret, to a single recipient. An attacker would have to intercept all &quot;t&quot; shares to recover the secret, a task which is more difficult than intercepting a single file, especially if the shares are sent using different media (e.g. some over the Internet, some mailed on CDs).

For large secrets, it may be more efficient to encrypt the secret and then distribute the key using secret sharing.

Secret sharing is an important primitive in several protocols for secure multiparty computation.
Secret sharing can also be used for user authentication in a system.

<text>The [[National coat of arms|coat of arms]] of Brazil () was created on 19 November 1889, four days after Brazil became a republic. It consists of the central emblem surrounded by coffee (&quot;Coffea arabica&quot;, at the left) and tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot;, at the right) branches, which were important crops in Brazil at that time. In the round shield in the center, the Southern Cross (&quot;Cruzeiro do Sul&quot;) can be seen. The ring of 27 stars around it represents Brazil&#x27;s 26 states and the Federal District.

The blue ribbon contains the official name of Brazil, República Federativa do Brasil — Federative Republic of Brazil, in its first line. Prior to 1964, this line contained the previous official name, Estados Unidos do Brasil — United States of Brazil. In the second line, the date of the proclamation of the Republic (15 November 1889) is written.

==National arms==
The National Arms of the Republic were instituted by Decree No. 4, with alteration made by Law No. 5443 of 28 May 1968 (Annex No. 8) The making of the National Arms should conform to the proportions of 15 units of height by 14 of width and take into account the following provisions:
*I - The round shield will be composed of a sky-blue [azul-celeste] field containing five silver [prata] stars arranged in the form of the Southern Cross, with the bordure [bordura] of the field outlined in gold and charged with silver stars equal to the stars existing in the National Flag (Modification made by Law No. 8421 of 11 May 1972).
*II - The shield will be placed on a star parted gyronny of ten pieces, green [sinopla] and gold, bordered by two strips, the inner red [goles] and the outer gold.
*III - All placed on a sword in pale, pommelled gold, hilted blue [blau], except for the center part, which is red [goles] and contains a silver star, all upon a crown formed by a branch of coffee fruited on the dexter side and another of flowering tobacco on the sinister side, both in proper colors, tied blue [blau], the whole assembled on a splendor of gold, the contours of which form a star of 20 points.

==Arms of the Empire of Brazil==
The Arms of the Empire of Brazil were used by both Emperors Pedro I and Pedro II until the downfall of the monarchy in 1889. These arms (with modifications) are used by the present imperial house.

On 18 September 1822, eleven days after proclaiming Brazil&#x27;s independence Royal Prince Dom Pedro signed a decree instituting these arms stating &quot;... henceforth the arms of this Empire of Brazil will be, on a green field, a gold armillary sphere superimposed on a Portuguese cross, the sphere encircled by 19 silver stars on a blue circle; and an imperial crown with diamonds set atop the shield, the sides of which will be embraced by two plants of coffee and tobacco, as emblems of its [the Empire&#x27;s] riches, in their proper colors and tied at the bottom with the national bow-knot.&quot;

On 12 October 1822 when the newly independent country was declared an Empire and Prince Pedro became the country&#x27;s first emperor, the coat of arms became known as the Imperial Coat of Arms.

The number of stars in the coat of arms reflected the number of provinces in the Brazilian Empire.

The design of the Crown in the coat of arms changed twice. From 18 September to 12 October 1822, the day when Emperor Dom Pedro I was crowned, the design of the Royal Crown of Portugal was used; from that day until 18 July 1841, the design of the Imperial Crown made for the first Brazilian Emperor was used.

On the latter date, when Brazil&#x27;s second emperor, Pedro II was crowned, using a new richer crown that was manufactured for him, the design of such Crown replaced the image of the older diadem in the coat of arms, and remained in use until the downfall of the Empire. That is the best-known version of the imperial coat of arms of Brazil.

== Arms of the Republic ==

The Republican coat of arms was adopted on 1889 after the Proclamation of the Republic. It was designed by German-Brazilian engineer Artur Zauer and lithographer Luís Gruder, both working under the Laemert printing house, which presented the symbol to Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca — the first President of Brazil — who immediately approved it and made it official as the national coat of arms.

The coat of arms went through its first change on 1968, adopting a brighter color gradient. And then had two smaller changes on 1971 and 1992, both adding more stars to represent newly created Brazilian states.

<text>The Iowa River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the state of Iowa in the United States. It is about long and is open to small river craft to Iowa City, about from its mouth. Its major tributary is the Cedar River.

==Course==
It rises in two branches, the West Branch and East Branch, both of which have their headwaters in Hancock County, each about long and which join in Belmond.

The Iowa then proceeds roughly in a southeast direction, passing through the city of Iowa Falls, through a scenic valley to Steamboat Rock, then through the cities of Eldora, Marshalltown, Tama, and Marengo, and through the Amana Colonies in Iowa County. In Johnson County, it becomes impounded by the Coralville Dam in the Coralville Reservoir, which turns southward to the spillway. The river runs generally south and passes through Iowa City and the University of Iowa campus. A lowhead dam at Burlington Street in Iowa City is the last dam before the river&#x27;s confluence with the Mississippi. South of Iowa City, it is joined in Washington County by the English River, and then in Louisa County it is joined by the Cedar River to flow into the Mississippi.

==Uses==
The Iowa River is noted for recreational and commercial fishing. Game fish include largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, northern pike, channel and flathead catfish, crappie and other panfish. The Coralville Reservoir is commercially fished for carp and buffalo fish.

Pine Lake State Park is located on the Iowa River at Eldora.

==Floods==
The Iowa can flood, notably in the June 2008 Midwest floods, and the Great Flood of 1993. The Cedar and its tributaries, including the Shell Rock River, can contribute to flooding events.
It tore down the historical swinging bridge in Charles City, Iowa.

==August 2022 jawbone discovery==
On the afternoon of August 8, 2022, Marshall County Conservation staff discovered a jawbone from a prehistoric Native American of middle age or older in the Iowa River in Marshall County.

<doc id="458257" wikidata="Q11125856" url="?curid=458257" title="Linguiça">
<text>Linguiça () is a Portuguese sausage made from pork and seasoned with onion, garlic, paprika and other spices. It can be used fresh in cooked preparations or undergo a curing and preservation process through smoking.

==Uses in Portuguese cuisine==
&quot;Linguiça&quot;, like many other sausages, is generally served as part of a meal, typically accompanied by rice, beans, and other pork products. &quot;Feijoada&quot;, for example, is a traditional Portuguese dish (considered Brazil&#x27;s national dish), also common in Angola, that incorporates &quot;linguiça&quot; with beans, ham hocks, and other foods.

In a place, one variant is especially popular: the &quot;linguiça calabresa&quot; or simply &quot;calabresa&quot;, prepared originally with Calabrese chili pepper by Italian immigrants, and particularly used in pizzas as a spicy sausage. Its popularity compares with pepperoni in the United States. It is common to differentiate the &quot;linguiça calabresa&quot; from its counterpart &quot;linguiça portuguesa&quot;, prepared from the original Portuguese recipe, and also served in pizzas as mild sausage, generally with egg slices.

&quot;Linguiça&quot; is also used in &quot;francesinha&quot;, a traditional Portuguese dish, from Porto. The &quot;linguiça&quot; is incorporated in its sauce, giving it a distinct flavour.

==Popularity and uses outside Portugal and Brazil ==
Outside of Portugal, &quot;linguiça&quot; is also popular in Goa, Macau, and other former Portuguese colonial possessions. In these regions, it is typically sliced before being grilled or braised, often with a light-bodied beer. It is also popular in California, Rhode Island, and southern Massachusetts.

In Hawaii, &quot;linguiça&quot; is known as &quot;Portuguese sausage&quot;, and is commonly eaten for breakfast. The sausage is usually smoked using banana leaves. Even the Hawaiian McDonald&#x27;s breakfast menu features Portuguese sausage, along with other Hawaiian foods such as rice and saimin.

<doc id="458260" wikidata="Q20713314" url="?curid=458260" title="Sellotape">
<text>Sellotape () is a British brand of transparent, cellulose-based, pressure-sensitive tape, and is the leading brand in the United Kingdom. Sellotape is generally used for joining, sealing, attaching and mending.

In much the same way that Scotch Tape came to be used in Canada and the United States when referring to any brand of clear adhesive tape, Sellotape has become a genericised trademark in Britain and a number of other countries where it is sold.

==History==
Sellotape was originally manufactured in 1937 by Colin Kinninmonth and George Grey, in Acton, west London. The name was derived from Cellophane, at that time a trademarked name, with the &quot;C&quot; changed to &quot;S&quot; so the new name could be trademarked.

Sellotape was made at a factory in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, from 1930 to about 1950 when it moved to Welwyn Garden City or thereabouts. 

The range of tapes available in the 1950s and 1960s was immense compared with what is available now on the retail market, including RBT (reinforced banding tape), metallic tapes and a tape used for repairing PCBs; E.S. &amp; A. Robinson were originally a packaging and paper products manufacturing company.

From the 1960s to 1980s, the Sellotape company was part of Dickinson Robinson Group, a British packaging and paper conglomerate.

Sellotape Industrial was bought by Scapa Group plc in 1997, and their products continue to be manufactured at its factory in Dunstable.

The Sellotape company was bought by Henkel Consumer Adhesives in 2002.

==Products==
The Sellotape brand now covers a variety of tape products, and the word is frequently used to refer to other adhesive tapes in many countries due to its market exposure. As an example of a genericized trademark, it gained an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1980.

==Use==
The tape can be used to repair tears in paper, or to attach pieces of paper or cardboard together for modelling. On fragile paper surfaces the tape can only be used once, as removing it will either tear the paper or remove the top layer of rough cardboard; on smooth painted surfaces it can generally be removed without leaving any trace, though sometimes the adhesive can remain on the surface after prolonged periods of time. It does not affix items to such surfaces permanently.

<doc id="458262" wikidata="Q1540491" url="?curid=458262" title="Gowanus Canal">
<text>The Gowanus Canal (originally known as Gowanus Creek) is a canal in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, on the westernmost portion of Long Island. Once a vital cargo transportation hub, the canal has seen decreasing use since the mid-20th century as domestic shipping declined. It continues to be used for occasional movement of goods and daily navigation of small boats, tugs, and barges. It is among the most polluted bodies of water in the United States. 

Connected to Gowanus Bay in Upper New York Bay, the Gowanus Canal borders the neighborhoods of Red Hook, Carroll Gardens, and Gowanus, all within South Brooklyn, to the west; Park Slope to the east; Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill to the north; and Sunset Park to the south. Seven bridges or viaducts cross the canal, carrying, from north to south, Union Street, Carroll Street, Third Street, the New York City Subway&#x27;s Culver Viaduct, Ninth Street, Hamilton Avenue, and the Gowanus Expressway.

The canal was created in the mid-19th century from local tidal wetlands and freshwater streams. For roughly a century, heavy industrial use poured pollutants into the canal. Various attempts to remove the pollution or dilute the canal&#x27;s water have failed. High ratios of fecal coliforms, deadly proportions of pathogens, and a low concentration of oxygen have left it generally incompatible with macroscopic marine life, although a variety of extremophiles have been observed in the canal.

Despite the canal&#x27;s heavy pollution, its proximity to Manhattan and upper-class Brooklyn neighborhoods is attracting concerted waterfront redevelopment. This has restarted calls for environmental cleanup, and prompted concerns that adjacent waterfront economic development would be incompatible with environmental restoration and environmental risks. It was designated a Superfund site in 2009, and work to clean up the canal began in 2013.

==Course==

The Gowanus Canal begins at Butler Street in the neighborhood of Boerum Hill, in the northwestern part of Brooklyn. The wastewater pumping station at 201-234 Butler Street, a terracotta structure dating to 1911, is located north of the canal&#x27;s head. The canal then runs in a south-southwest alignment parallel to the local street grid. Its course is located mid-block between Bond Street to the west and Nevins Street to the east. Along the way it passes bridges at Union Street, Carroll Street, and Third Street from south to north. While the Union Street and Third Street Bridges are movable bascule bridges, the Carroll Street Bridge is a retractable bridge that can be rolled diagonally to let ships through.

The western bank of the Gowanus Canal hosts a boat launch at Second Street. The Second Street boat launch is located adjacent to a &quot;Sponge Park&quot;, which absorbs pollutants from the western bank before they can go into the canal. At Fourth Street, the Fourth Street Basin splits off to the east, while the Gowanus Canal proper turns west. A walkway with seating, built as part of the construction of a Whole Foods Market, is located on the north bank of the 4th Street Basin.

At Hoyt Street, two blocks west of Bond Street, the canal turns south with two extra tributaries at the east: one tributary at Seventh Street, and another near Sixth Street. Shortly afterward, it crosses under the Ninth Street Bridge, a vertical-lift bridge opened in 1999. The New York City Subway&#x27;s Culver Viaduct, a fixed-span viaduct, crosses above the Ninth Street Bridge. The viaduct contains the Smith–Ninth Streets station, which is partially located above the canal and is served by the . There is a short tributary to the east, about long, connecting to the parking lot of a Lowe&#x27;s home-improvement store to the east, and Hamilton Plaza: a shopping center located at 1-37 12th Street which formerly housed a Pathmark supermarket and a Dunkin&#x27; Donuts directly to the south. At this point, a walkway leads from Lowe&#x27;s north to Ninth Street along the northern bank of the tributary and the eastern bank of the canal. Owing to its hidden location, the waterfront promenade has seen little use.

At approximately 14th Street along the eastern bank, Hamilton Avenue and the Gowanus Expressway cross the canal at a diagonal from southeast to northwest, connecting to Lorraine Street on the western bank. Separate movable bascule bridges built in 1942 carry both directions of Hamilton Avenue&#x27;s traffic, while the Gowanus Expressway rises on a viaduct far above the canal.

The Gowanus Canal&#x27;s mouth is at the Gowanus Bay, a portion of Upper New York Bay bordering western Brooklyn. The mouth is located near 19th Street on the eastern bank, or Bryant Street on the western bank. The canal takes a north-northeasterly course from this point, running east of Smith Street. An asphalt plant and marine transfer station are located on the canal&#x27;s eastern bank, as well as a Home Depot and a FedEx Shipping Center.

==History==
===Early history===
====Mill Creek====
The Gowanus neighborhood originally surrounded Gowanus Creek. It consisted of a tidal inlet of navigable creeks in original saltwater marshland and meadows that contained wildlife. The Dutch government issued the first land patents within Breukelen (modern-day Brooklyn), including the land of the Gowanus, from 1630 to 1664. In 1636, the leaders of New Netherland bought the area around the Gowanus Bay. In 1639, the inhabitants swapped land claims with each other to build a tobacco plantation. The area&#x27;s early settlers named the waterway &quot;Gowanes Creek&quot; after &quot;Gouwane&quot;, sachem (chief) of the local Lenape tribe called the Canarsee, who farmed on the shores.

Adam Brouwer, who had been a soldier in the service of the Dutch West India Company, built and operated the first tide-water gristmill patented in New York at Gowanus. The mill was located on land that was deeded on July 8, 1645, to Jan Evertse Bout. It was the first gristmill in the town of Breukelen and the first mill to operate in New Netherland. The mill was located north of Union Street, west of Nevins Street, and next to Bond Street. A second mill—Denton&#x27;s Mill, also called Yellow Mill—was built on Denton&#x27;s Mill Pond, after permission was granted to dredge from the creek to the mill pond once located between Fifth Avenue and the present-day canal at Carroll and Third Streets. On May 26, 1664, several Breuckelen residents, headed by Brouwer, petitioned Director General Peter Stuyvesant and his Council for permission to dredge a canal at their own expense through the land of Frederick Lubbertsen to supply water to run the mill. The petition was presented to the council on May 29, 1664, and the motion was granted. Another mill, Cole&#x27;s Mill, was located just about at present day 9th Street, between Smith Street and the canal. Cole&#x27;s Mill Pond, located north of 9th Street, occupied the present location of Public Place.

====Farms and oyster fishing====
In 1699, a settler named Nicholas Vechte built a farmhouse of brick and stone now known as the Old Stone House. In 1776, during the Battle of Long Island, American troops engaged British Army troops at the house, enabling General George Washington to relocate his troops behind American lines. This house sat at the southeastern edge of the Denton&#x27;s Mill pond. Brower&#x27;s Mill, also known as Freeks Mill or Brouwer&#x27;s Mill, was located at the present-day intersection of Union and Nevins Streets. It can be seen in drawings depicting the Battle of Brooklyn.

Throughout this period, a few Dutch farmers settled along the marshland and engaged in clamming of large oysters that became a notable first export to Europe. The Gowanus Bay&#x27;s tides pushed brackish water further into the creek, creating an environment where large bivalves thrived. In succeeding generations, negative artificial selection slowly reduced the size of the bivalves, since smaller bivalves were better adapted to the creek&#x27;s water. Larger bivalves were less likely to survive, and thus, less likely to reproduce. In 1774 the Government of New York enacted a law to widen the creek into a canal, to keep the watercourse in good condition, and to levy taxes on people who used land near it.

===Industrial use===
====Transformation to city====
By the mid-19th century, the City of Brooklyn was quickly growing and was the United States&#x27; third-largest city. The creek and surrounding agricultural land was now part of an urban agglomeration, consisting of villages along the creek&#x27;s shores. That same shoreline of river and swamp functioned as both a transportation system and an informal sewage system for the growing city. The valley&#x27;s watershed is approximately and includes drainage from what are now the adjacent neighborhoods of Carroll Gardens and Park Slope. Wealthier residents tended to live inland and uphill to avoid the smells and &quot;discomforts&quot; of lower areas. Industries, which needed water for processing, transport, and disposal of wastes, gravitated toward sites along the shoreline.

The mills on the Gowanus were home to public landing sites, connecting the water route to the old Gowanus Road. As the local population grew, and the 19th-century industrial revolution reached Brooklyn, the need for larger navigational and docking facilities grew. Colonel Daniel Richards, a successful local merchant, advocated building a canal to benefit existing inland industries, and draining the surrounding marshes for land reclamation that would raise property values.

In 1849, under a decree by the New York Legislature, the Gowanus Creek was deepened so it could be used as a commercial waterway connected to Upper New York Bay. The creek&#x27;s dredging was completed in 1860. Another act of the Legislature in 1867 allowed the canal to be deepened further. In the same decade, a developer named Edwin Litchfield undertook a project to straighten the creek into a canal.

At the time the , canal was built, several designs were proposed for it. Some included lock systems that would have allowed daily flushing of the whole waterway. However, these designs were considered too expensive. After exploring numerous alternative (and some more environmentally sound) designs, the final plan was chosen for its low cost. United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Major David Bates Douglass was hired to design the canal, which was essentially complete by 1869. The cost of the construction came from assessments on the local residents of Brooklyn and State money.

====Industrial heyday and massive pollution====
Despite its relatively short length, the Gowanus Canal was a hub for Brooklyn&#x27;s maritime and commercial shipping activity. At its busiest, as many as 100 ships a day transported cargo through it. In addition, the industrial sector around the canal grew substantially over time to include stone and coal yards; flour mills; cement works, and manufactured gas plants; tanneries, factories for paint, ink, and soap; machine shops; chemical plants; and sulfur producers. All of these industries emitted substantial water and airborne pollutants. Chemical fertilizers were manufactured along the canal soon after the Civil War.

Coal processing had been a dominant industry since 1869. By the late 19th century, there were 22 coal plants with frontage on the canal. Coal plants along the upper canal used large amounts of water in the conversion of coal to coke, liquids and gases. Coal gas was soon used for heating, light, and factory power. Coke was used to make steel. Wastewater and coal tar (now known to be a source of carcinogens) were dumped back into the canal. Brooklyn&#x27;s slaughterhouses dumped blood and other wastes into the canals.

There was no through-flow of water and the canal was open at only one end, but the hope was that tides would be enough to flush the waterway. With the canal&#x27;s wooden and concrete embankments, the strong tides of fresh diurnal doses of oxygenated water from New York Harbor were barred from flowing into the channel. With the high level of development in the Gowanus watershed area, excessive nitrates and pathogens are constantly flowing into the canal, further depleting the oxygen and creating breeding grounds for the pathogens responsible for the canal&#x27;s odor. Water quality measures of the concentration of oxygen in the canal were just 1.5 ppm, well below the minimum 4 ppm needed to sustain life. The canal water took on a reddish-purple color, and a colloidal mixture described as &quot;black mayonnaise&quot; accumulated on its bottom.

In 1887, the New York State Legislature closed the Bond Street outflow point. By 1889, pollution in the Gowanus Canal had become so bad that the Legislature appointed a commission to study ways to ameliorate the canal&#x27;s condition. It concluded that the canal would be best off if it were closed to commercial traffic and then covered-over. The commission also called the canal &quot;a disgrace to Brooklyn&quot; because of the foul smells arising from the waterway.

==== Attempts to lessen pollution====
The first step to ameliorate the canal&#x27;s pollution was the 1890s construction of the Bond Street sewer pipeline that carried sewage out into the harbor. This proved inadequate. In the first attempt to improve flow at the northern, closed end of the canal, the &quot;Big Sewer&quot; was constructed from Marcy Avenue in Prospect Heights to Green and 4th Avenues in Gowanus. It then entered the canal at an inflow point near Butler Street. &quot;Scientific American&quot; featured this sewer design for its innovative construction method and size. The area the sewer ran through was known as the &quot;Flooded District&quot;. It was believed that this new sewer would serve two purposes: to drain the flooded district, and to use the flow of that excessive water to move the water of the upper Gowanus Canal. The tunnel was completed by 1893, but Brooklyn residents complained their sewage outputs were not connected to the Big Sewer. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; initially hailed the sewer&#x27;s size and extent. However, the newspaper declared it an &quot;engineering blunder&quot; in 1898, saying the Big Sewer caused sewage to go back into the Gowanus Canal, rather than its intended purpose of draining sewage from it.

During the first decade of the 20th century, up to 700 structures were built in South Brooklyn every year. Thriving industry brought many new people to the area, but important questions about wastewater sanitation had not been properly addressed to handle such growth. All sewage from the new buildings drained downhill and into the Gowanus. Since there was less open ground than before, rainwater now went onto the roofs of the buildings and down into the canal. The building of new sewer connections only compounded the problem by discharging raw sewage from farther away neighborhoods into the canal. Pollutants, storm runoff, and discharge from the sewage system combined to make the canal&#x27;s malodor so disgusting it was nicknamed &quot;Lavender Lake&quot;. Compounding the problem, area property owners sued the city for damages related to the flooding issues that plagued the canal.

By 1910, complaints were being made about the canal&#x27;s water being almost solid waste, which provoked the installation of a flushing tunnel that was across. The Butler Street Pumping Station, a Beaux-Arts structure at the canal&#x27;s inland end, opened on June 21, 1911. The new flushing tunnel connected to the Pumping Station. At first, the brick-lined tunnel supplied clean water from the Buttermilk Channel between Brooklyn and Governors Island, carried it eastward underneath Butler Street, and discharged the clean water at the mouth of the Gowanus Canal. The flushing tunnel also failed, and aside from numerous operational glitches, a long series of errors and mistakes occurred throughout the 1960s. This culminated in an incident when a city worker dropped a manhole cover, severely damaging the pump system, which was already suffering from the effects of the corrosive salt water. The Clean Water Act of 1972 had not yet been passed, and the city, stretched for funds at the time, did nothing to address the issue. As a result of the unrepaired damage to the flushing tunnel, and the long stretch of economic recession, the waters of the canal lay stagnant and under-used for years.

====Reputation as dumping ground====
There is an urban legend that the Gowanus Canal served as a dumping ground for the Mafia. Some cases are on record: news reports state that the bodies of a Brooklyn racketeer in the 1930s and a president of the Grain Handlers Union in the 1940s were found in the canal. In &quot;Lavender Lake&quot;, a 1998 documentary about the canal, two New York City police officers discussed how two fishermen had recently pulled from the canal a suitcase containing human body parts. 

Several people have died after driving into the canal; examples include one man on January 2, 1919; Police Officer Daniel J. Grennan on December 9, 1920; two people on July 25, 1921; and two men on January 30, 1928.

There have been reports of vessels lost in the canal. For instance, on January 2, 1889, the tugboat &quot;Hugh Bond&quot; sank in the canal during a gale, though the crew escaped. On May 10, 1892, the canal boat &quot;Alpha&quot; sank with a cargo of coal. On December 31, 1903, a dredge was found sunk in the canal, and an unnamed engineer/nightwatchman was reported missing and believed to be drowned. On August 13, 1918, a policeman found 28 sections of a submarine boxed in sections on the banks of the canal.

===Economic decline===
With six million tons of cargo hauled annually though the waterway after World War I, the Gowanus Canal became the nation&#x27;s busiest commercial canal, and arguably the most polluted. The heavy sewage flow into the canal required regular dredging to keep the waters navigable. By the 1950s, Brooklyn&#x27;s fuel trade was already converting from coal and artificial gas to petroleum, which was served by the wider and deeper Newtown Creek, and natural gas, which arrived by pipeline. In 1951, with the opening of the elevated Gowanus Expressway over the waterway, easy access for trucks and cars catalyzed industry slightly. The expressway carried 150,000 daily vehicles, which unloaded tons of toxic emissions into the air and water beneath. Around this time, sewage going to the Gowanus Canal was redirected into sewage treatment plants near the Buttermilk Channel.

With the early 1960s growth of containerization, the number of industrial waterfront jobs in the state declined. With much fanfare, the USACE completed its last dredging of the canal in 1955, and soon afterward abandoned its regular dredging schedule, deeming it to no longer be cost-effective. The intake fan that brought Buttermilk Channel water into the flushing tunnel broke in 1963, leading to its closure. A year later, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened, eliminating the need for industrial boats to use the canal at all, since trucks could use the bridge and Interstate 278 to ship goods from around the country to the Gowanus area.

With the failure of the city sewage and pump station infrastructure, the Gowanus Canal was used as a derelict dumping place. It remained in that condition for almost three decades. By 1993, a single company was actively using the Gowanus Canal as a shipping channel, and three of the drawbridges along the canal would only retract to let that company&#x27;s boats pass. The few remaining barges mostly carried fuel oil, sand, gravel and scrap metal for export. The canal still serves as a port moving goods in and out of Brooklyn.

==Environmental cleanup==

===Early attempts at cleanup===

Repeated calls have been made to revitalize the economy and the environment of the Gowanus area. The first major U.S. law that would allow this, a law to address water pollution, was the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948. It was followed by the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 and the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972.

Beginning in the 1960s, locals formed the Carroll Gardens Association (CGA) to lobby for civic improvements, including cleanup of the Gowanus Canal. Long-time restaurateur Nick Monte called it a &quot;stinking, cancerous sore&quot; and a &quot;stinking cesspool&quot;. CGA founder Salvatore &quot;Buddy&quot; Scotto Jr. referred to the canal as &quot;the most polluted waterway in the world&quot;, and &quot;the spine of our deterioration&quot;, relating it directly to the economic problems of the area. In 1971, the City of New York held hearings on a Gowanus Industrial Urban Renewal Project, but did not support it with funding.

In 1974, Scotto brought microbiologists from the New York City Community College (now New York City College of Technology, or City Tech) to test the Gowanus Canal&#x27;s water for bacteria. The organisms they found included several that caused typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and tuberculosis. The next year, funding was obtained for a preliminary assessment of the canal. Initial findings revealed an almost total absence of oxygen, much raw sewage, grease, oil, and sludge. In 1978, construction began on the Red Hook Sewage Treatment plant in Vinegar Hill that had been planned since the 1950s.

A full study of the canal was published in 1981. It indicated that on an average day, more than of raw sewage emptied into it. The report also documented the decreasing use of the canal by industry and shipping. The number of industrial firms using the canal fell from nearly fifty in 1942 to six in 1981. The amount of freight brought through the canal was more than 55% lower, and the number of times the drawbridges on the canal was opened declined by almost 70%. The report put forward a number of recommendations, one of which was fixing the flushing tunnel to increase the oxygen content of the water.

In 1987, the Red Hook Treatment Plant was opened, diverting more sewage input from the canal. This $375 million plant collected waste from the existing Bond Street sewer and brought the total of combined sewer overflow (CSO) points in the city to 14. With the opening of the new plant, the last dry-weather discharge into a New York City waterway ended, and the CSO points now only function during rain storms. The next year a sewage pipe was installed within the flushing tunnel, but according to a New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) engineer, the pipe was so poorly installed that it failed &quot;almost immediately&quot;. The city unsuccessfully attempted to fix the flushing tunnel&#x27;s sewage pipe in 1998. It was fixed in 1999 after engineers reversed the direction of the tunnel&#x27;s fan. Previously, water from the canal had gone westward into the Buttermilk Channel, but now water from the channel went into the Gowanus Canal.

===Superfund cleanup===

====Planning====
In 2002, the US Army Corps of Engineers entered into a cost-sharing agreement with the DEP to collaborate on a $5 million Ecosystem Restoration Feasibility Study of the Gowanus Canal area. It was to examine possible alternatives for ecosystem restoration such as dredging, and wetland and habitat restoration and be completed in 2005. Discussions turned to breaking down the hard edges of the canal to restore some of the natural processes to improve the overall environment of the Gowanus wetlands area. The DEP also initiated the Gowanus Canal Use and Standards Attainment project to meet the city&#x27;s obligations under the Clean Water Act.

In early 2006, the problem of wastewater management arose during a controversy over a planned arena for the Brooklyn Nets in nearby downtown Brooklyn. The project, at that point called Pacific Park, was to include a basketball arena and 17 skyscrapers. The resulting sewage would flow into antiquated combined sewers that can overflow when it rains. The Gowanus Canal has 14 combined sewer overflow points. The fear was the additional wastewater from the arena would lead to more frequent overflows in the canal.

In March 2009, the EPA proposed that the canal be listed as a Superfund cleanup site. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) supported this action. It had requested help from the EPA to address the canal&#x27;s environmental problems. In May 2009, the city stepped forward to oppose the Superfund listing. For the first time it offered to produce a Gowanus cleanup plan that would match the work of a Superfund cleanup, but with a promise to accomplish it faster. The city said it could now achieve a faster cleanup than the EPA. It would fund the cleanup through taxpayer dollars from the state and city levels, while the EPA would seek its funding from the polluters. The nonprofit Gowanus Canal Conservancy was also founded in 2009, creating partnerships with the EPA, the NYCDEP, groups such as Riverkeeper, and universities such as Cornell and Rutgers. On March 4, 2010, the EPA announced that it had placed the Gowanus Canal on its Superfund National Priorities List. Following this, the Corps of Engineers halted its study immediately, giving all its research to the EPA.

Initially, local residents resisted the EPA&#x27;s proposed cleanup methods, as they feared that the toxic waste retrieved from the canal would instead be displaced onto nearby public areas. By 2013, the NYCDEP was planning to reduce the sewage content of the canal by repairing the freshwater tunnel that flushed the Gowanus. The repair was designed to mitigate, but not eliminate, the sewage problem. On September 27, 2013, the EPA approved a cleanup plan for the Gowanus Canal. The plan, which would cost $506 million was intended to be completed by 2022, and divided the canal into three segments split by 3rd Street and the Hamilton Avenue Bridge. The plan entailed three steps: dredging contaminated sediment from the bottom of the canal; capping the dredged areas; and implementing controls on combined sewer overflows to prevent future contamination. It also involved excavating and restoring approximately of the former 1st Street Basin and of the former 5th Street Basin. The restoration was expected to be paid for by the host of entities deemed &quot;responsible parties&quot; for the pollution by the EPA, including Brooklyn Gas and Electric, now part of National Grid and the City of New York.

The EPA suggested seven plans for the cleanup. In 2014, the EPA presented a proposal for containing toxic sludge in the Gowanus Canal. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; reported two scenarios as most viable. These were estimated to take ten years to complete and would cost around $350–$450 million. The first step in the plans was dredging, which was scheduled to begin in 2016. The second step was to lay down one of two different proposed &quot;caps&quot;. The first &quot;cap&quot; proposal was for a concrete device, while the second was for a multi-layered device with pollutant-absorbent clay, a sand buffer, and an anchor composed of rocks. Ultimately, the multi-layered cap was selected for installation in the canal. However, there were concerns that the cleanup could pose a health risk.

====Beginning of cleanup====
In early 2017, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who had proposed many of the EPA budget changes and program eliminations, approved of the funding, saying that Superfund cleanups should be prioritized.

Work on the cleanup process began in October 2017, and at the time, the cleanup was expected to cost $506 million. The first phase of a pilot study at the canal&#x27;s Fourth Street Turning Basin began in December 2016, but was delayed while bulkheads were being installed along the canal&#x27;s banks. The pilot dredging uncovered several artifacts such as a crash boat from World War II; industrial wooden bobbins for textiles; and 19th-century wagon wheels. These artifacts had to be cleaned of contaminants before archaeologists could study them. In July 2018, during the pilot study, the promenade near Whole Foods was damaged due to contractor error. The cleanup itself was expected to start in 2020 and be completed two years later. The EPA issued a formal order on Tuesday, January 28, 2020, which initiated the first phase of the $506 million cleanup on the 1.8 mile long canal. This $125 million first phase would begin in September 2020 and last 30 months, though it wound up lasting 46 months ending in July 2024.

On June 27, 2024, the EPA amended the 2020 order with a $369 million contract, beginning the second phase of cleanup, with no end date in sight.

===Components===
====EPA treatment====

The canal&#x27;s toxic sediment layer averages thick, and at some spots reaches . As part of the Superfund cleanup, the EPA would remove approximately of highly contaminated sediment from the upper and middle segments and of contaminated sediment from the lower segment. The sediment would be treated at an off-site facility.

Then, at the locations where contamination had permeated the underlying sediment, the EPA would cap the dredges with multiple layers of clean material. The multi-layer caps consist of an &quot;active&quot; layer made of a specific type of clay that would remove contamination that could well up from below. Atop the clay layer is an &quot;isolation&quot; layer of sand and gravel that will ensure that the contaminants are not exposed. Next, an &quot;armor&quot; layer of heavier gravel and stone prevents boat traffic and canal currents from eroding the underlying layers. The topmost layer comprises sufficient clean sand atop the &quot;armor&quot; layer, filling the gaps in the layer of stones and establishing sufficient depth to restore the canal bottom as a habitat. In the middle and upper segments of the canal, where liquid coal tar has seeped into the natural sediment, the EPA would stabilize that sediment by mixing it with concrete or similar materials. The stabilized areas would then be covered with the multiple-layer caps.

As the Superfund model required the EPA to seek restitution from the Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs), the estimated cost of the cleanup plan would be divided and distributed among more than 30 companies responsible for polluting the canal, as well as government entities like the New York City government and the United States Navy. Some of these companies, such as Brooklyn Union Gas, either no longer existed, had relocated, or had been renamed. If these defunct companies have been incorporated into another company, the property owners and the parent companies were expected to take responsibility, as are the companies that created or moved the pollutants around. The EPA Superfund Gowanus report identified two major PRPs: National Grid (which later acquired Brooklyn Union Gas&#x27; successor KeySpan) and the New York City government.

====Reactivation of the flushing tunnel====

According to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, plans to reactivate the flushing tunnel pump were proposed in 1982. Various events caused the project to be delayed until 1994. The tunnel was finally reactivated in 1999. The new design employed a 600 horsepower (450 kW) motor, that pumped an average rate of a day of aerated water from the Buttermilk Channel in the Upper New York Bay into the head end of the canal. Although water was circulating through the tunnel, tidal forces meant it could only be pumped 11 hours a day. The water quality of samples taken while the flushing pump was operating was reported to have improved.

In 2010, New York City began a four-year project to upgrade and reactivate the flushing tunnel. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the proposed plans included steps to &quot;reconstruct the motor pit and replace the propeller with three modern vertical turbines; clean, patch and smooth the interior of the tunnel; replace the broken sewer pipe and encase it in concrete to improve water flow; and reduce the amount of sewer overflow into the canal by increasing capacity at a nearby pumping plant&quot;. Increasing oxygen content was a major goal of the project. The original plans were modified in 2012, after Hurricane Sandy, to protect critical equipment from flooding. In 2014, following completion of much of the work, the tunnel was reactivated at a cost of $177 million.

====Stormwater management====
Throughout its history, the Gowanus Canal&#x27;s sewage problems have been exacerbated by the effects of stormwater. For years, heavy rains have flooded streets and caused sewage lines to overflow, contributing to the canal&#x27;s contamination. Much of the Gowanus Canal area is at sea level, in a Zone A risk area for flooding. To help prevent flooding, the city is investing in various methods of stormwater management. One related improvement has been the creation of specialized curbside gardens, or bioswales, along sidewalks to absorb stormwater and reduce sewer overflows into the canal. A community-based non-profit organization, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, is involved in stewardship of the bioswales. In 2015, the city built Sponge Park, along the canal&#x27;s western bank at Second Street. The park doubles as a stormwater catchment area, absorbing pollutants before they can go into the canal.

Beginning in 2017, the city&#x27;s Department of Environmental Protection built several miles of high-level storm sewers (HLSS) to prevent stormwater from flooding the city&#x27;s sewage system. The new storm sewers carry stormwater collected in new and existing catchment areas, preventing it from entering the sewage system. The first phase, comprising sewer installations south of Douglass Street, was supposed to be completed by summer 2018; a second phase north of Douglass Street would proceed from 2018 to 2020. The HLSS, built on a area east of the northern end of the canal, are planned to capture half of the stormwater within the Gowanus Canal&#x27;s watershed.

Also in 2017, the New York City government published plans to construct two combined sewer overflow treatment facilities along the canal to help with stormwater management. The first facility, the &quot;Head End Site&quot;, is to be at the very north end of the canal on the eastern bank. The facility, located adjacent to an existing manufactured gas plant site, would handle sewage from the Red Hook Watershed, which comprises the land around the canal&#x27;s western bank and north of the canal&#x27;s head. The second facility, the &quot;Owls Head Site&quot;, is to be at Second Avenue and Fifth Street, where the Fourth Street Basin splits off the rest of the canal. It would clean the water from the Owls Head watershed, which constitutes the land from the eastern bank to Prospect Park. These new facilities are required as part of an agreement between the city and the EPA.

By February 2019, the EPA and the city disagreed on whether untreated sewage should be stored in tanks or flushed out through a tunnel. The EPA wanted to divert the sewage to two newly built tanks along the canal, which would be less costly and be complete by 2027. However, the city has proposed diverting untreated sewage into a new tunnel, which would be more expensive and be finished in 2030. The EPA and the city agreed to the two-tank option, and the city began construction on the larger tank by September 2023 and the smaller tank by March 2024, with completion for both expected by 2029.

==Redevelopment==

===Redevelopment plans===

As early as 1980, the Gowanus area&#x27;s low rents and proximity to more expensive cultural centers in New York had attracted artists and musicians. The sparsely occupied industrial area offered spaces for studios, music venues, bars, gyms and other businesses that benefited from low space-to-cost ratios. Nonetheless, the area&#x27;s population declined to a historic low of 24,000 residents in 1990. The Carroll Street Bridge, an important Gowanus Canal crossing, closed for renovations in 1985. This caused major inconveniences for the surrounding communities, who had to walk several blocks to get to the other side of the canal. Businesses and schools closed as a result. The bridge reopened in 1989, its 100th anniversary.

In 1999, Assemblywoman Joan Millman allocated $100,000 to the Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation (GCCDC) to produce and distribute a bulkhead study and public access document. The following year, GCCDC received $270,000 from the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation&#x27;s Green Street program to construct three street-end public open spaces along the Gowanus Canal. Governor George E. Pataki funded an additional $270,000 to create a revitalization plan in 2001. $100,000 in capital funds were allocated in 2002 to implement a pilot project on the shoreline. In 2003, Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez allocated an additional $225,000 to create a comprehensive community development plan. The organization relies on community volunteers to maintain and clean these Green Street Projects.

The New York City government, local citizens&#x27; groups, developers, the EPA, and the USACE had a wide variety of concerns and differing visions for redevelopment in the area. The New York City government feared that designating the Gowanus Canal as a Superfund site would result in many potentially costly lawsuits against polluters. Meanwhile, the area directly to the east of the Gowanus neighborhood was rezoned for high density residential use with a strong commercial component in 2003. In 2009, plans to rezone Gowanus were also created. Many residents and community groups have expressed concern over the sewage overflow that the rezoning could possibly create.

===Redevelopment sites===
The United States Postal Service closed a USPS maintenance garage on the east side of the Ninth Street Bridge in the early 1990s. The site became available for commercial development. In 1998, the site was proposed for the construction of Brooklyn Commons, a $63 million entertainment and retail complex featuring a 22-screen multiplex cinema, a bowling alley, shops, restaurants and a 1,500-space parking lot. The Swedish furniture store IKEA planned to open a store on the site, but withdrew its proposal in 2001 after opposition from the community. IKEA was later given permission to build a store in adjacent Red Hook. The 9th Street site remained empty until 2004 when a large Lowe&#x27;s store was built and opened, along with an adjacent public promenade overlooking the canal.

By 1998, the neighborhoods around the canal (Carroll Gardens and Park Slope) were experiencing a resurgence of interest in the residential market. Perceptions of environmental risk related to pollution and possible flooding vied with the appeal of a diverse community accessible to more expensive areas of New York City. The area was given a new zoning designation, the &quot;Gowanus Manufacturing Zone&quot;, as various groups try to determine the future of this complex urban space.

===Effects of the cleanup on redevelopment===

In February 2009, the City of New York granted a zoning change to the developer, Toll Brothers Inc. This allowed for a 480-unit, twelve-story super-block residential project, the first one permitted along the waterway. The city also set aside some land for a medium-sized development with 3,200 apartments. Twenty-five city blocks were allocated for 60 sites that were planned to produce a combined $500 million in tax revenues per year. Toll Brothers abandoned their project in 2010 after the Gowanus Canal was declared a Superfund cleanup site.

However, the cleanup itself led to a larger redevelopment movement in Gowanus. The first large-scale luxury development in the Gowanus area, 365 Bond, opened in June 2016 and was completely occupied by the following year. There were more than 56,000 applications for the 86 affordable apartments included in the development. In August 2016, the city restarted the rezoning process for the surrounding neighborhood. In June 2017, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy began the process of designing a redevelopment plan for the area. Officials planned to reveal a more comprehensive plan in 2018, including rezoning a 43-block area and requiring developers to reserve 25% of the new units for affordable housing.

By late 2017, new development was concentrated around a rezoning area in the northern half of the canal. Although this area had gentrified rapidly, some residents opposed the new developments. The zoning plan for the area was projected to undergo changes through 2019, at which point the Superfund cleanup would be at its peak. Several developers bought, or were planning on buying, abandoned or little-used waterfront sites along the canal. An artist&#x27;s community at Ninth Street was being turned into a mixed-use office building complex. In addition, the lyric-annotation website Genius.com had moved into a building along the northern portion of the canal.

==Current usage==
Organizations dedicated to providing waterfront access and canal education include the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club (founded in 1999), and The Urban Divers Estuary Conservancy (founded in 1998). During the 2003 season, more than 1,000 people participated in Dredger Canoe Club programs, logging more than 2,000 trips along the canal. During the 2024 season, the club logged 1,144 trips on the Canal as access is restricted due to the ongoing Superfund cleanup.

The city government took a site at Smith and 4th Streets in 1975 and designated it a public place for use as &quot;public recreation space&quot;. Despite the legal standing as a Public Place, developers have continually proposed developing the site for other uses. National Grid is accountable for cleanup of the pollution left on the site after years of coal gas manufacture. Upon completion of this cleanup, the site was to be turned over to the New York City Parks Department.

===Activism===
In November 2006, HABITATS, a festival dedicated to &quot;local action as global wisdom&quot;, celebrated the Gowanus Canal with environmental conferences, collaborative art, educational programs and interactive walks around the area. The canal has also been the home to various arts organizations. Issue Project Room once organized art events in a converted silo along the bank of the canal. The Yard, an outdoor concert space, opened in the summer of 2007 near the Carroll Street Bridge, but shut down at the end of summer 2010.

On Earth Day in 2015, environmental activist Christopher Swain swam through the Gowanus Canal to promote awareness of the environmental restorative work. He wore protective swimwear however some of his skin was exposed to the biological and industrial waste. He applied preventative countermeasures such as antibacterial lotion and a hydrogen peroxide mouthwash. Swain, who had swum through heavily polluted waterways, described the Gowanus as being the dirtiest body of water that he had swum through, composing of &quot;mud, poo, detergent, oil and gasoline&quot; and &quot;swimming through a dirty diaper&quot;.

==Water quality==
Different parts of the Gowanus Canal are effectively microclimates, which may have very different conditions and types of contamination. Overall, the water is considered unsafe to drink or swim in, and contact with the canal&#x27;s water is discouraged. The Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club encourages people to canoe on the canal, in part as an incentive to revitalize the area. The Urban Divers Estuary Conservancy allows careful diving using full-encapsulation suits, followed by rigorous decontamination procedures. Fish caught in the canal are generally toxic and unsafe to eat in large quantities. birds have begun returning to the canal, which some hope suggests the water quality is improving enough to support wildlife.

===Anecdotal descriptions===
Anecdotal reports of the canal&#x27;s water quality include descriptions of a reddish-purplish color due to coal and slaughterhouse wastes in the 19th century, and a lighter purplish color, leading to its nickname &quot;Lavender Lake&quot; in the 20th century. Twentieth-century author H. P. Lovecraft described &quot;the lapping oily waves at its grimy piers&quot;. In 1999, the water&#x27;s usual color was described as &quot;green with a white undertone, akin to the look of cream-infused coffee&quot;. A 2013 account describes the canal&#x27;s &quot;modern&quot; color as being gray-green. In 2017, two long-time residents recalled the canal&#x27;s black color in the 1950s: &quot;All you could see was a big cesspool, and bubbles coming up.&quot;

The surface of the Gowanus Canal&#x27;s water has frequently been reported to have an iridescent sheen suggestive of oil, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), coal tar, and other industrial wastes. As recently as December 2009 a Gowanus Canal Investigation Executive Summary Report noted the presence of &quot;spotty, iridescent, and platy sheens of varying intensity,&quot; fecal matter, emulsified oil, and blebs of non-aqueous phase liquid in various areas of the canal. Photographers have also captured artistic images of the canal.

The opaqueness of the canal&#x27;s water obstructs sunlight to one-third of the depth needed for the bottom-level growth of aquatic plants. Rising gas bubbles betray the decomposition of sewage sludge that on a warm, sultry day produces the Gowanus Canal&#x27;s notable ripe stench. One reporter in 1999 described the smell as &quot;like sticking your head into a rubber boot filled with used motor oil and rotten eggs,&quot; while another in 1998 said that it was &quot;less a scent than an assault that reaches in to choke the throat. Sometimes it has the biting odor of petroleum, with more than a hint of dead fish.&quot; There are reports that the smell has lessened in recent years as oxygen levels in the water have increased.

The murky depths of the canal conceal the legacy of its industrial past: cement, oil, mercury, lead, multiple volatile organic compounds, PCBs, coal tar, and other contaminants. A sludgy bottom-layer of &quot;black mayonnaise&quot; was described beginning in the 19th century and is still present—in some places up to deep.

===Scientific measurements===
Beginning in the 1970s, a variety of governmental, academic, and citizens&#x27; groups have taken intermittent measurements of the canal&#x27;s water quality. There has been no coherent, long-term program for tracking water quality because no funds exist for such a program.

The canal hosts high levels of pathogens, many of which are harmful to humans. The 1974 report by New York City Community College microbiologists found that the water contained typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and tuberculosis. Additionally, a 2003 report of the New York Harbor showed that the Gowanus Canal had the highest level of pathogens of any location in the entire harbor. Microbiologist Nasreen Haque and her classes from the City University of New York have also tested water from the Gowanus. In 2007–2008, Haque&#x27;s classes reported finding &quot;every kind of imaginable pathogen&quot;, including those that cause gonorrhea. However, in 2010, students from City Tech found lower levels of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; than they had expected.

Fecal matter is also prevalent in the canal. In 2009, a local environmental &quot;neighborhood watch&quot; called Riverkeeper tested canal water immediately following heavy rains and sewage flooding. It reported &quot;Enterococcus&quot; at levels of 17,329 cells per 100 milliliters, with anything above 104 cells per 100 milliliters being considered unsafe; &quot;Enterococcus&quot; is considered an indicator of other possible pathogens. As of 2013, fecal matter was still present in Gowanus&#x27; water at levels of parts per hundred. A more usual measurement for a waterway would be parts per million.

Low levels of dissolved oxygen in the canal&#x27;s waters predate World War I. The minimum level of oxygen required to support healthy marine life is estimated at 4 parts per million. As early as 1909, it was reported that the canal had no oxygen at all. In 1975 a severe lack of oxygen was still observed, indicating the water was incapable of sustaining plant life or fish. In 1999, just before the flushing tunnel was reactivated, &quot;The Environmental Magazine&quot; reported that oxygen levels in the Gowanus Canal measured about 1.5 parts per million; this number continued to be quoted fourteen years later. However, by 2008, nine years after the flushing tunnel was reopened to provide oxygenation of the water, biologist Kathleen Nolan and students from St. Francis College sampled the water and reported that levels of dissolved oxygen had substantially increased. In 2014, a NYSDEC representative stated that dissolved oxygen levels were reported to be in the range of , or approximately 9–12 parts per million.

With respect to the underlying layers of residue in the canal, the EPA and other organizations have performed detailed analyses of the composition and distribution of black mayonnaise throughout it. The 2012 Superfund Proposed Plan also includes detailed assessments of risk related to the types of pollutants in the layers of sediment, the water, and the surrounding area.

The Gowanus Canal&#x27;s pollution has also spread to Gowanus Creek, at the mouth of the canal. In 1982, USACE released the results of a report on navigation in the creek. It found that there were nonexistent levels of oxygen; high concentrations of fecal coliforms; and significant clusters of oil and grease.

===Wildlife===
Originally, the marshland and freshwater springs that drained into the Atlantic Ocean in Upper New York Bay were capable of supporting massive oyster beds. As late as 1911, people reported fishing in the Gowanus Canal and treading for clams. By 1927, the last of New York&#x27;s oyster beds had closed as a result of habitat destruction, over-harvesting, and pollution.

Attempts have been made to reintroduce oysters and other shellfish to the canal, because they can filter out toxins and help clean the water. One oyster can process as much as of water a day. The NY/NJ Baykeeper environmental group gives oysters to volunteers who then monitor their health and growth in local waterways. They have helped Katie Mosher-Smith and The Gowanus Community Oyster Garden&#x27;s Stewards to partner with teachers, students and the Gowanus Dredgers Canoe Club to install and monitor oyster cages in the canal. In 2012, landscape architect Kate Orff proposed a design for a park with a living reef containing oysters, mussels, and eelgrass. As part of a pilot program, ropes were hung off of a pier to attract ribbed mussels.

Restoration of the flushing tunnel, and the resulting increase in oxygen levels in the canal, have supported the return of some aquatic life. Within months of the reopening of the flushing tunnel in 1999, John C. Muir of the Brooklyn Center for the Urban Environment observed pink jellyfish, blue crabs, and a variety of fish. By 2009, white perch, herring, striped bass, and anchovies were living in the waterway. In 2014, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy reported that herons, egrets, bats, and Canada geese were living nearby. However, individuals and populations of wild animals living in the Gowanus Canal may be at risk for reproductive problems. Creatures living in the canal generally have a below-average life expectancy compared to members of the same species living elsewhere in New York Harbor.

Approximately 15 edible species of fish and shellfish can be found in the canal, but they are toxic. The shellfish contain toxins and are unsafe to eat, according to a 2012 report. However, signs posted in 2018 note that men over age 15 and women over age 50 can safely eat up to six blue crabs from the Gowanus Canal each week, although women under 50 and children under 15 should not eat the canal&#x27;s blue crabs at all.

Aquatic mammals have been observed in the canal only rarely and in cases of severe distress. A harp seal was observed in the canal in 2003, its flippers bloodied, but it survived and was relocated to the Long Island Sound. In 2007, a young minke whale ended up in the canal as a result of heavy storms. The whale, soon nicknamed &quot;Sludgy&quot;, was unable to get out and soon died. A necropsy of Sludgy, performed by animal anatomist Joy Reidenberg, indicated that the whale had already been sick. On January 26, 2013, a dolphin entered the canal at low tide, was unable to get out, and died. A necropsy showed that it was middle-aged and sickly before becoming trapped. It had kidney stones, gastric ulcers, and parasites.

===New forms of life===

Although the Gowanus Canal is poisonous to humans, it may be breeding previously unidentified types of organisms. In 2008, Nasreen and Nilofaur Haque reported the presence of white clouds of &quot;biofilm&quot; floating above the sludge on the bottom of the canal. Examinations suggested that the colloquially named &quot;white stuff&quot; is a co-operative mix of bacteria, protozoa, chemicals, and other substances. The parts of the mixture acted together to find food, and the biological components exchanged genes and excreted material that acts as an antibiotic to protect it from toxins in the water. The Haques started studying methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; from the canal to learn more about what makes bacteria resistant, so that the research might help to develop new antibiotic drugs.

In 2014, volunteers and scientists donned Hazmat suits to sample the black mayonnaise from the canal, extracting DNA which was sequenced at the Weill-Cornell Medical College. Ellen Jorgensen, executive director of the startup Genspace, reported that the group failed to identify half of the DNA. They found &quot;42 kinds of bacteria, two viruses, and five life forms from the domain Archaea,&quot; many uniquely adapted to the extreme environment of the Gowanus Canal. Methylococcaceae, a family of microbes found in the Fourth Street Basin, consume methane. Desulfobacterales take in sulfate and release hydrogen sulfide, contributing to the Gowanus&#x27; characteristic rotten egg smell.

Bioengineers and others involved in the 2014 study were also interested in studying the Gowanus Canal&#x27;s unique microbial communities. These naturally-evolving bioremediating bacteria consume the Gowanus&#x27; pollutants. Understanding how they co-exist with and degrade toxic compounds might suggest new methods for bioremediation.

==In popular culture==
Thomas Wolfe described the &quot;huge symphonic stink&quot; of the canal which was &quot;cunningly compacted of unnumbered separate putrefactions&quot; in his 1940 novel &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again&quot;. The 1985 film &quot;Heaven Help Us&quot; used Carroll Street Bridge as a filming location. In Jonathan Lethem&#x27;s &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (1999), a character refers to the canal as &quot;the only body of water in the world that is 90 percent guns&quot;. In Joseph O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s novel &quot;Netherland&quot; (2008), the remains of one of the protagonists are found in the Gowanus Canal. In an episode of the TV show &quot;Bored to Death&quot;, called &quot;The Gowanus Canal Has Gonorrhea!&quot;, two antagonists threaten the show&#x27;s hero with a swim in the canal.

In 2014, So What? Press published an issue of its comic series &quot;Tales of the Night Watchman&quot;, entitled &quot;It Came from the Gowanus Canal&quot;, about a toxic sludge monster who lives in the canal and takes revenge on a gangster who once dumped bodies there. It was written by Dave Kelly and illustrated by Molly Ostertag. The publisher also produced a fake movie poster in conjunction with the Gowanus Souvenir Shop based on the issue in 2015. In 2017, a sequel to the comic was produced with the title &quot;It Came from the Gowanus Canal...Again!&quot; It was written by Dave Kelly, drawn by Brett Hobson, colored by Clare DeZutti, with a cover by Tim Hamilton. In the sequel, the monster returns and takes revenge on criminals who are responsible for the death of a young boy, but the Night Watchman must protect one of the killers to stop the monster.

In November 2015, &quot;Gothamist&quot; posted a video that featured a fisherman saying that he had just caught a three-eyed catfish in the canal. Although the story was later posted by a number of news outlets, experts expressed skepticism about the fish story. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article indicated that the three-eyed catfish was a hoax perpetrated by the performance artist Zardulu.

<text>The Big Sioux River is a tributary of the Missouri River in eastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa in the United States. It flows generally southwardly for , and its watershed is . The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on &quot;Big Sioux River&quot; as the stream&#x27;s name in 1931. The river was named after the Lakota people which was known by them as Tehankasandata, or Thick Wooded River.

The Big Sioux River rises in Roberts County, South Dakota, on a low plateau known as the Coteau des Prairies and flows generally southwardly through Grant, Codington, Hamlin, Brookings, Moody, and Minnehaha counties, past the communities of Watertown, Castlewood, Bruce, Flandreau, Egan, Trent, Dell Rapids, and Baltic to Sioux Falls, where it passes over a waterfall in Falls Park, which gives that city its name. Downstream of Sioux Falls and the community of Brandon, the Big Sioux defines the boundary between South Dakota and Iowa, flowing along the eastern borders of Lincoln and Union counties in South Dakota, and the western borders of Lyon, Sioux and Plymouth counties in Iowa, past the communities of Canton, Fairview, Hudson, Hawarden, North Sioux City, and Dakota Dunes in South Dakota and Beloit, Hawarden and Akron in Iowa. It joins the Missouri River from the north at Sioux City, Iowa.
The Big Sioux River, at the USGS station in Sioux City, Iowa, has a mean annual discharge of approximately 3,793 cubic feet per second.

==Tributaries==
The Big Sioux River collects the Rock River from the northeast in Sioux County, Iowa. A minor headwaters tributary of the Big Sioux in Grant County, South Dakota, is known as the Indian River. Broken Kettle Creek has its confluence with the Big Sioux in Plymouth County, Iowa.

Other creek tributaries include Peg Munky Run, North Deer, Sixmile, Skunk, Split Rock, Beaver, Brule, and Pipestone.

==Pollution==
The Big Sioux is South Dakota&#x27;s most populated river basin. Agriculture is the primary use of land along most of the river&#x27;s course. To comply with the Clean Water Act, the state monitors water quality of its rivers. Most of the Big Sioux north of Sioux Falls was scored well in 2012. Portions near Lake Kampeska and between Willow and Stray Horse Creeks (Codington and Hamlin counties) exceeded federally allowable levels of &quot;E. coli&quot; and fecal coliform bacteria. However, the Big Sioux south of Sioux Falls is much more polluted with &quot;E. coli&quot;, fecal coliform, and suspended solids. Several portions heavily restrict fishing or human contact, and swimming is banned.

==Flood control==
Between 1955 and 1961, an extensive flood control system was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers along the Big Sioux and some of its tributaries in Sioux Falls to protect the city from a 100-year flood event. Features of the system include of levees, a floodwall in downtown, and a diversion channel with a dam at one end and a spillway at the other. The diversion channel connects two ends of the Big Sioux&#x27;s natural loop around central Sioux Falls in an effort to channel floodwater away from the city. The levees then act to contain any floodwater either remaining in the natural channel or originating from Skunk Creek (whose mouth is downriver of the diversion dam). Additionally, a greenway covers much of the river&#x27;s floodplain in southern and eastern Sioux Falls, further mitigating any property damage from high water.

=== Flooding ===
The Big Sioux River experienced record-breaking flooding during the 2019 Midwestern U.S. floods.

The Big Sioux River Flood Information System was used to model flooding during the March 2019 bomb cyclone event.

The river overflowed its banks between September 12–15, 2019, flooding three blocks of Dell Rapids, South Dakota, and damaging up to a dozen homes. Interstate 90 was shut down between Mitchell and Sioux Falls.

The river once again flooded in 2024, resulting in at least one death and multiple destroyed homes, roads, and businesses. Most notably in the McCook Lake area.

<text>Earl of Swinton is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1955 for the prominent Conservative politician Philip Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Viscount Swinton. He had already been created Viscount Swinton, of Masham in the County of York, in 1935, and was made Baron Masham, of Ellington in the County of York, at the same time he was given the earldom. Born Philip Lloyd-Greame, he was the husband of Mary Constance &quot;Molly&quot; Boynton, granddaughter of Samuel Cunliffe-Lister, 1st Baron Masham. When his wife inherited the large Masham estates in 1924, they assumed the surname of Cunliffe-Lister in lieu of Lloyd-Greame.

The earl was succeeded by his grandson, who became the second earl. He was the eldest son of Major the Hon. John Yarburgh Cunliffe-Lister, who was killed in the Second World War. Lord Swinton notably served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard (deputy chief government whip in the House of Lords) from 1982 to 1986 in the Conservative administration of Margaret Thatcher. His wife was Susan Cunliffe-Lister, Baroness Masham of Ilton. the titles are held by Lord Swinton&#x27;s nephew, the fourth earl, who succeeded his father in that year.

The title is named after Swinton Park near Masham, North Yorkshire. The family seat is now Dykes Hill House, also near Masham.

<doc id="458275" wikidata="Q1277104" url="?curid=458275" title="Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor">
<text>Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor is a title in the peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1945 for Liberal parliamentarian David Lloyd George who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1908 to 1915 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1916 to 1922. He was created Viscount Gwynedd, of Dwyfor in the County of Caernarvon, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, at the same time.

Lloyd George&#x27;s family name is not hyphenated, although it was required to appear as such in his title, as in other cases such as Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baron Lloyd-Webber.

Both the territorial designations Dwyfor and Gwynedd are ancient Welsh placenames. They were subsequently revived, in 1974, for a local government district and county respectively.

The family titles are currently held by his great-grandson, the 4th Earl, who succeeded his father in 2010.

Two of David Lloyd George&#x27;s children also earned distinction in public life. His second son, the Hon. Gwilym Lloyd George, was Home Secretary from 1954 to 1957 before being created Viscount Tenby in 1957; and his daughter Megan Lloyd George represented Anglesey and Carmarthen in the House of Commons.

The family seat during the 3rd Earl&#x27;s lifetime was Ffynone House, near Boncath, Pembrokeshire.

<doc id="458277" wikidata="Q1349446" url="?curid=458277" title="Red Jacket">
<text>Red Jacket (known as Otetiani [Always Ready] in his youth and Sagoyewatha [Keeper Awake] &quot;Sa-go-ye-wa-tha&quot; as an adult because of his oratorical skills) (c. 1750 – January 20, 1830) was a Seneca orator and chief of the Wolf clan, based in Western New York. On behalf of his nation, he negotiated with the new United States after the American Revolutionary War, when the Seneca as British allies were forced to cede much land following the defeat of the British; he signed the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794). He helped secure some Seneca territory in New York state, although most of his people had migrated to Canada for resettlement after the Paris Treaty. Red Jacket&#x27;s speech on &quot;Religion for the White Man and the Red&quot; (1805) has been preserved as an example of his great oratorical style.

==Life==
Red Jacket&#x27;s birthplace has long been a matter of debate. Some historians claim he was born about 1750 at &quot;Kanadaseaga&quot;, also known as the Old Seneca Castle. Present-day Geneva, New York, developed near here, at the top of Seneca Lake. Others believe he was born near Cayuga Lake and present-day Canoga. Others say he was born south of present-day Branchport, at Keuka Lake near the mouth of Basswood Creek. It is known that he grew up with his family at Basswood Creek, and his mother was buried there after her death. The Iroquois had a matrilineal kinship system, with inheritance and descent figured through the maternal line. Red Jacket was considered to be born into his mother&#x27;s Wolf Clan, and his social status was based on her family and clan. He was taught by his mother at a young age that truth was a powerful weapon. 

Red Jacket lived much of his adult life in Seneca territory in the Genesee River Valley in western New York. In the later years of his life, Red Jacket moved to Canada for a short period of time. He and the Mohawk chief Joseph Brant became bitter enemies and rivals before the American Revolutionary War, although they often met together at the Iroquois Confederacy&#x27;s Longhouse. During the war, when most of both the Seneca and Mohawk were allies of the British, Brant contemptuously referred to Red Jacket as &quot;cow killer&quot;. He alleged that at the Battle of Newtown in 1779, Red Jacket killed a cow and used the blood as evidence to claim he had killed an American rebel.
===Relationship with Joseph Brant===
There was a mutual dislike between Red Jacket and Joseph Brant (Thayendanegea). Each was the leading man among their own people, and rival politicians. Since the Senecas and the Mohawks were the principal nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, each sought the first place in the confederacy. Both were artful and eloquent men; while Brant had the advantage of education and travel, Red Jacket was superior in devotion to his people.

Joseph Brant was a bold and sagacious warrior. Red Jacket, on the other hand, disliked war and bloodshed. Red Jacket considered that the Senecas could only be free so long as they remained true to their culture. He believed that every art and custom of &#x27;civilization&#x27; which they adopted increased their dependency on the Euro-American society.

While Brant maintained a friendly relationship with the English throughout his life, favouring the introduction of agriculture to the Mohawks and converting to the Christian faith in early life, Red Jacket opposed the missionaries, the Christian religion, and everything that originated from the oppressors of his people. Following some alleged land speculations against Brant in 1803, Red Jacket was successful in removing him from the chieftainship of the Confederacy. However, at a subsequent council, Brant was able to reverse this decision. 
===Silver medal from George Washington===
Red Jacket became famous as an orator, speaking for the rights of his people. His language was beautiful and figurative, and delivered with the greatest ease and fluency. After the war, he played a prominent role in negotiations with the new United States federal government. In 1792 he led a delegation of 50 Native American leaders to Philadelphia. The US president George Washington presented him with a special &quot;peace medal&quot;, a large oval of silverplate engraved with an image of Washington on the right-hand side shaking Red Jacket&#x27;s hand; below was inscribed &quot;George Washington&quot;, &quot;Red Jacket&quot;, and &quot;1792&quot;.

Red Jacket wore this medal on his chest in every portrait painted of him. The medal was held from 1895 to 2021 in the collection of the Buffalo History Museum. In May 2021, it was repatriated to the Seneca Nation and is currently held in the collection of the Onöhsagwë:De&#x27; Cultural Center, also known as the Seneca-Iroquois National Museum. A formal repatriation ceremony was held on May 17, 2021 at the Seneca Nation&#x27;s Cultural Centre in Salamanca, since the Native Americans Graves Protection and Repatriation Act recognized Red Jacket&#x27;s medal as culturally important to the Seneca nation. The Senecas made a formal request for its return in October 2020, almost 125 years after the Buffalo Historical Society came in the possession of the medal in 1898, when the last living relative of the estate of Red Jacket sold it to the museum.

He was also presented with a silver inlaid half-stock long rifle, bearing his initials and Wolf clan emblem in the stock and his later name &quot;Sagoyewatha&quot; inlaid on the barrel. This rifle has been in private hands since his death.

===Diplomacy===

In 1794, Red Jacket was a signatory, along with Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, and fifty other Iroquois leaders, of the Treaty of Canandaigua, by which they were forced to cede much of their land to the United States due to the defeat of their British ally during the war. Britain had ceded all its claims to land in the colonies without consulting the Iroquois or other Native American allies. The treaty confirmed peace with the United States, as well as the boundaries of the postwar the Phelps and Gorham Purchase (1788) of most of the Seneca land east of the Genesee River in western New York.

In 1790 the Public Universal Friend and the Philadelphia Society of Friends were the first settlers in the formerly Seneca region. Despite the pillaging of the Native River-Settlement in Ah-Wa-Ga Owego, New York, by generals Clinton and Sullivan during the Revolutionary War, the Society made peace with the wary Seneca tribe. The Seneca Tribe made peace with settlers in the Finger Lakes region, but they suffered hardship in the Genesee Region and other parts of Western New York.

In 1797, by the Treaty of Big Tree, Robert Morris paid $100,000 to the Seneca for rights to some of their lands west of the Genesee River. (This area developed as present-day Geneseo in Livingston County). Red Jacket had tried to prevent the sale but, unable to persuade the other chiefs, he gave up his opposition. As often occurred, Morris used gifts of liquor to the Seneca men and trinkets to the women to &quot;grease&quot; the sale. Morris had previously purchased the land from Massachusetts, subject to the Indian title, then sold it to the Holland Land Company for speculative development. He retained only the Morris Reserve, an estate near the present-day city of Rochester. During the negotiations, Brant was reported to have told an insulting story about Red Jacket. Cornplanter intervened and prevented the Seneca leader from attacking and killing Brant.

==War of 1812==
Red Jacket took his name, one of several he used as an adult, from a highly favored embroidered coat given to him by the British for his wartime services. The Seneca allied with the British Crown during the American Revolution, both because of their long trading relationships and in the hope that the British could limit American encroachment on their territory. After the British were defeated, the Seneca were forced to cede much of their territory to the United States. Many of their people resettled in Canada at what is now the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. In the War of 1812, Red Jacket supported the American side. At a council of the New York indigenous nations called on July 6, 1812 by the Indian agent Erastus Granger, Red Jacket acted as a spokesman of the Senecas. When asked by Granger if the Senecas were to join the war on the British side, Red Jacket replied that his people cared more for peace than for war, and that he did not wish their Canadian brothers’ blood be spilled when there was so little occasion for it.
===Ambush at South of Chippawa===
Peter B. Porter was able to successfully negotiate an alliance with Red Jacket to assist the American armed forces in the Battle of Chippawa. Red Jacket conceived of a plan to maneuver his force of 300 Seneca warriors close enough to ambush the enemy force which consisted of British regulars, Canadian militia, and Mohawks. Peter B. Porter accompanied Red Jacket&#x27;s force with a force of his own numbering 250-300 men. Porter&#x27;s 250-300 man force consisted mostly of American militia and some U.S. regulars. Porter and Red Jacket headed with their combined force of 600 Senecas, militia, and regulars to ambush the British-allied force. Porter&#x27;s 600 man force moved stealthily into the woods, creeping off to the south. The Americans entered the natural cover of the massive forest to stay out of sight of the enemy. The Americans came close undetected to the enemy&#x27;s position. The Americans formed a formation of 3 arcs. Red Jacket&#x27;s Senecas were in the 2 front arcs while Porter&#x27;s men were in the third arc in the rear. Red Jacket&#x27;s Senecas all wore white-hankie hats so that Porter&#x27;s men could tell the difference between a British mohawk indian and a pro-American Seneca indian in the heat of battle. Once the Americans were in position enveloping the unsuspecting enemy. Each American aimed and leveled his gun at an enemy. The Americans sprang their ambush and opened heavy fire. The British-allied force was taken completely by surprise and many of them dropped dead. The Americans then charged in and engaged the enemy in close hand-to-hand combat. The Americans brutally killed many British, Canadian, and Mohawk as they were still so shocked and confused from the American ambush. The British and their allies retreated into the wilderness. Peter and his force pursued the enemy. However, the Americans ran into a fresh reserve of British regulars waiting in linear formation who fired a volley. Porter and his force retreated to safety as the British pursued them a short distance. After the battle of Chippawa ended between the main British army and the main American army, all British forces including the British main army withdrew temporarily. Porter and his men came back to their ambush site to police the scene to assess casualties of their force and of the enemy. There were at least 90 dead bodies of British, Canadian, and Mohawks. There were only a dozen dead Americans on the field. The Senecas scalped all of the dead British, Canadian, and Mohawks. After that, Porter, Red Jacket, and their forces withdrew from the field.

==Later life==
His later adult name, &quot;Sagoyewatha&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;he keeps them awake&quot;, was given by the Seneca about 1780 in recognition of his oratory skill. When in 1805 Jacob Cram, a New England missionary, asked to do mission work among the Seneca, Red Jacket responded by saying that the Seneca had suffered much at the hands of Europeans. His speech, &quot;Religion for the White Man and the Red&quot;, expressed his profound belief that Native American religion was fitting and sufficient for Seneca and Native American culture. It has been documented and preserved as one of the best examples of North American oratory.

Red Jacket developed a problem with alcohol and deeply regretted having taken his first drink (see following quote). When asked if he had children, the chief, who had lost most of his offspring to illness, said:

Red Jacket was once a great man, and in favor with the Great Spirit. He was a lofty pine among the smaller trees of the forest. But, after years of glory, he degraded himself by drinking the firewater of the white man. The Great Spirit has looked upon him in anger, and his lightning has stripped the pine of its branches.

In his later years, &quot;Sagoyewatha&quot; lived in Buffalo, New York. In his last public speech titled ‘I am an aged tree and can stand no longer’ from 1829, Red Jacket foresaw his death. He stated that he was like an old tree whose leaves had fallen, branches withered, and that he had been shaken by every breeze. Although he was about to be joined with the spirits of his ancestors, it made him uneasy to think about the Senecas, who, as he rightfully predicted, were soon to be scattered and forgotten. On his death, his remains were buried in an Indian cemetery (now within Seneca Indian Park in South Buffalo, New York). In 1876, the politician William C. Bryant presented a plan to the Council of the Seneca Nation to reinter Red Jacket&#x27;s remains in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo. This was carried out on October 9, 1884. The proceedings, with papers documenting speeches given by Horatio Hale, General Ely S. Parker (Red Jacket&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s grandson, known as a &quot;clan grandson,&quot; who inherited the famous medal), and others, were published (Buffalo, 1884). A memorial to Red Jacket, sculpted by James G. C. Hamilton, still stands within Seneca Indian Park.

According to &quot;Appletons&#x27; Cyclopædia of American Biography&quot;, &quot;Several portraits were made of him. George Catlin painted him twice, Henry Inman once, and Robert W. Weir did his portrait in 1828, when Red Jacket was on a visit to New York City. Fitz-Greene Halleck has celebrated him in song.&quot;

==Speech to Rev. Cram==
This famous speech, also known as his talk on &quot;Religion for the White Man and the Red&quot;, is an example of his great skill as an orator. He spoke in 1805 as a response to a request by Jacob Cram, a New England missionary, to evangelize among the Seneca. On this day, the two men met in Buffalo Creek, New York, to discuss their religious beliefs. After meeting with the leaders of the Seneca delegation, Red Jacket provided a thought-out response representing his people as a whole. After expressing his gratitude to the Great Spirit for the opportunity to meet, Red Jacket stated that the Senecas listened with excitement to Cram’s proposal. He responded to Cram&#x27;s words: &quot;There is but one religion, and but one way to serve God, and if you do not embrace the right way, you cannot be happy hereafter&quot;. He argued peacefully that the European Americans and Native American peoples should each have the right to worship the religion that suits them best.

At the time, the Iroquois of present-day New York State were having difficulty dealing with the constant increase of European immigrants and encroachment on their remaining lands. As the numbers of European Americans grew in the Iroquois territories, the two peoples&#x27; opposing cultures became more and more apparent.

Red Jacket made it clear that he and his people would not change their religious beliefs based on the white man&#x27;s word. He began, &quot;It was the will of the Great Spirit that we should meet together this day. He orders all things, and has given us a fine day for our Council.&quot; He proceeded to count all the blessings on the day, attributing them to the Great Spirit. &quot;For all these favors we thank the Great Spirit, and Him only.&quot;

Red Jacket said that his peoples&#x27; beliefs were very like those of the missionary, differing only in the names of their omnipresent and almighty creator. Their creation stories were the same. &quot;There was a time when our forefathers owned this great island. Their seats extended from the rising to the setting sun. The Great Spirit had made it for the use of Indians. He had created the buffalo, the deer, and other animals for food . ... He had caused the earth to produce corn for bread. All this He had done for his red children, because He loved them.&quot; But that changed when Cram’s forefathers crossed the ocean and landed in the Americas to freely enjoy their religion. Red Jacket pointed out that they were greeted by the indigenous peoples who gave them corn and meat. But what they got in return was poison and liquor. The difference between the faiths involved not whether an almighty creator existed, but which faith was the truth and deserved to be followed.

Red Jacket questioned the legitimacy of the white man&#x27;s beliefs. &quot;You say that you are sent to instruct us how to worship the Great Spirit agreeably to his mind, and, if we do not take hold of the religion which you white people teach, we shall be unhappy hereafter. You say that you are right and we are lost.&quot; Iroquois &quot;separatist&quot; belief held that there is not necessarily one true religion for all people. Red Jacket acknowledged that the European Americans&#x27; religious beliefs were based on a sacred text, but said, &quot;If it was intended for us as well as you, why has not the Great Spirit given to us, and not only to us, but why did he not give to our forefathers, the knowledge of that book, with the means of understanding it rightly?&quot;

In conclusion he urged his audience to accept different forms of belief. &quot;The Great Spirit has made us all, but He has made a great difference between his white and red children ... to you He has given the arts. To these He has not opened our eyes. We know these things to be true. Since He has made so great a difference between us in other things, why may we not conclude that he has given us a different religion according to our understanding? The Great Spirit does right. He knows what is best for his children; we are satisfied.&quot; &quot;We do not wish to destroy your religion, or take it from you. We only want to enjoy our own.&quot;

On another occasion, Red Jacket delivered a speech known as ‘We like our religion and do not want another’ to Reverend Alexander from New York City during a Seneca council at Buffalo Creek in May 1811. Noticing that ‘the black coats’ come with sweet voices and smiling faces, offering to teach the religion of the white people, Red Jacket proposed that, if they wished well to the Senecas, to keep away and not disturb them. The reason being that the Senecas loved their own religion and did not want another. 

===Civility===
In his &quot;Speech to the U.S. Senate&quot;, Red Jacket was respectful and open-minded regarding his visitors&#x27; beliefs, hoping that his audience would respond similarly. &quot;We have listened with attention to what you have said. You requested us to speak our minds freely. This gives us great joy; for we now consider that we stand upright before you, and can speak what we think.&quot; He reassured his audience that he understood they were far from home, and would waste no time in giving them his answer.
On the relations between his people and the first white settlers to come to their land, he said, &quot;They found friends and not enemies ... they asked for a small seat. We took pity on them, granted their request; and they sat amongst us. We gave them corn and meat; they gave us poison.&quot; He argued that it was wrong to portray his people as savages, when they had shown kindness but received in return only &quot;poison&quot; (hard liquor). Further,

Yet we did not fear them. We took them to be friends. They called us brothers. We believed them and gave them a larger seat ... they wanted more land; they wanted our country. Our eyes were opened, and our minds became uneasy. You have got our country, but are not satisfied; you want to force your religion upon us.

The white settlers&#x27; actions did not encourage belief in their religion. &quot;How shall we know when to believe, being so often deceived by the white people?&quot;

Red Jacket also acknowledged that the white settlers&#x27; religion was beset with divisive controversies, unlike his peoples&#x27; own faith.

We also have a religion, which was given to our forefathers, and has been handed down to us their children. We worship in that way. It teaches us to be thankful for all the favors we receive; to love each other, and to be united. We never quarrel about religion.

He wished his visitors well. &quot;You have now heard our answer to your talk, and this is all we have to say at present. As we are going to part, we will come and take you by the hand, and hope the Great Spirit will protect you on your journey, and return you safe to your friends.&quot;

===Rhetoric===
Red Jacket&#x27;s &quot;Speech to the U.S. Senate&quot; expresses his ability to use a distinct form of rhetoric that distinguishes the difference in religious tolerance between the Indians and United States citizens. His emotional appeal to members of the US Senate, whom he feels are neglecting the Indians&#x27; right of religious freedom, is an example of his attempt to persuade his audience to recognize their fallacies. He repeatedly refers to the Great Spirit, who he believes oversees both the red and white man.

At the beginning, he says, But we will first look back a little, and tell you what our fathers have told us, and what we have heard from the white people&quot;. Red Jacket is referring to the history of how the white man has treated the red man on the latter&#x27;s native soil. The white man commonly tried to persuade the Indians, whom he considered less fortunate, to adopt the ways of Western society. Red Jacket noted the European Americans had tried to force their religion on the Indian peoples. Red Jacket recognized religion as a cultural right, but he explained that the Indians had inherited their belief system within their culture just as the European Americans had been given the Bible and Christianity. He said that both people came from a similar Great Spirit, yet it is up to the beholder as to how he accepts religion. The attempts of European Americans to force Christianity on the Indians violated the liberties of both people. Red Jacket said, &quot;You have now become a great people, and we have scarcely a place left to spread our blankets. You have got our country, but are not satisfied; you want to force your religion upon us.

Red Jacket continues to identify the religious continuities that exist between both people with his elaboration on the Great Spirit. He states, &quot;You say there is but one way to worship and serve the Great Spirit. If there is but one religion, why do you white people differ so much about it? Why not all agreed, as you can all read the book?&quot;. Red Jacket distinguishes the fallacies that exist between the Americans&#x27; speech and their actions. If the Indians are being secularized for their religious beliefs, yet they believe in one ultimate Creator, just like the European Americans, how can they be viewed as a lesser body? Red Jacket says they do not understand the European Americans&#x27; mission to eradicate the Indians based on religion, but Red Jacket sees the European Americans as divided in their beliefs. However, he goes on to say that the Great Spirit is not one that can tear the two people apart but ultimately unite them in their ability to peacefully coexist.

Red Jacket&#x27;s ability to distinguish this form of religious discussion was very favorable to his legacy in history. He argues the injustices of the cultural system in the time period but does not back away from recognizing their common cultural and religious beliefs.

<text>The Upper Iowa River is a tributary of the Mississippi River in the upper Midwest of the United States.

Its headwaters rise in southeastern Minnesota, in Mower County (Le Roy and Lodi townships) near the border with Iowa. It then flows through the Iowa counties of Howard, Winneshiek, and Allamakee, and finally into the Upper Mississippi River near New Albin, Iowa. Along its course, it passes through the Iowa cities of Chester, Lime Springs, Florenceville, Kendallville, Bluffton, and Decorah. Its watershed comprises nearly .

The Upper Iowa and its tributaries are part of the Driftless Area of Iowa, a region that was ice-free during the last ice age. Unlike areas to the south and west, the area was not planed down by glaciation or covered in glacial drift, resulting in present-day topography featuring steep-walled canyons and high-relief bluffs.

Because of its intrinsic qualities and minimal development, the Upper Iowa River was the only river in Iowa previously considered for designation as a National Wild and Scenic River. A 1971 study conducted by the National Park Service recommended the state of Iowa designate the river as a state scenic river, and that the state then apply to the United States Department of the Interior for inclusion as a unit of the National Park Service. It has not yet attained this status, partly due to disagreements in funding between federal and state agencies and because much of the land and the riverbottom itself are privately owned (13,500 acres of desired 14,300 acres as cited in the 1971 study).

The river is a destination for canoeing, taking paddlers through the scenic bluff country. Many put their canoes in at Kendallville or nearby down river, but some paddlers prefer to start at Lime Springs by the Lidtke Mill or at Florenceville.

A number of wildlife refuges and preserves dot the river&#x27;s basin. Bird sightings on the river usually include bald eagles, great blue herons, turkey vultures, and barn swallows.

In April 2007, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation announced the purchase of of additional land; currently off limits to the public, stabilization and restoration work will be done to the riverbank, with removal of non-native vegetation and replanting with more appropriate species.

The Upper Iowa was sometimes historically called the &quot;Iowa River&quot;, creating confusion with the larger Iowa River to the south. The Upper Iowa was also called the &quot;Oneota River&quot;, and the large number of Late Prehistoric sites along its bluffs caused the early archaeologist Charles R. Keyes to name the Oneota Culture for the river.

<text>Earl of Gowrie is a title that has been created twice, once in the Peerage of Scotland and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, both times for members of the Ruthven family. It takes its name from Gowrie, a historical region and ancient province of Scotland. On 23 August 1581, William Ruthven, 4th Lord Ruthven, was created Earl of Gowrie by James VI, King of the Scots. He was executed for high treason, attainted and his peerages forfeited on 28 May 1584. Two years later in 1586, the attainder was reversed and his son, the second Earl, was restored as Earl of Gowrie and Lord Ruthven, but both peerages were forfeited after the alleged plot and subsequent death of the second Earl&#x27;s younger brother, the third Earl, in 1600.

The Ruthven family descended from Sir William Ruthven, who was created Lord Ruthven in the Peerage of Scotland in 1488. Lord Ruthven&#x27;s son and heir, William Ruthven, Master of Ruthven, was one of the many Scottish nobles killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Lord Ruthven died in 1528 and was succeeded by his grandson, William, the second Lord, the son of the Master of Ruthven. The second Lord was an Extraordinary Lord of Session and Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, Patrick, the third Lord. Patrick was the leader of the band which murdered David Rizzio. After the murder he fled to England where he died in 1566. He was succeeded by his son, William, the aforementioned fourth Lord, who was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581 (see above).

Thomas Ruthven, grandson of Alexander Ruthven of Freeland, younger son of the second Lord Ruthven, was created Lord Ruthven of Freeland in 1651. His descendant Walter Hore-Ruthven, 9th Lord Ruthven of Freeland, was created Baron Ruthven of Gowrie, of Gowrie in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1919. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Walter, the tenth Lord and former major general in the British Army. On the latter&#x27;s death in 1956 the Scottish lordship of Parliament devolved on his daughter, Bridget Helen Monckton, 11th Lady Ruthven, while the barony of Ruthven of Gowrie created in 1919 (which could only descend through male lines) devolved on his great-nephew, Grey Ruthven, 2nd Earl of Gowrie, who became the third Baron. Lord Gowrie was the grandson of the Honourable Alexander Hore-Ruthven, Governor-General of Australia between 1936 and 1945 and the second son of the ninth Lord Ruthven of Freeland. Alexander Hore-Ruthven had been elevated to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Gowrie, of Canberra in the Commonwealth of Australia and of Dirleton in the County of East Lothian, in December 1935. In January 1945 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Ruthven of Canberra, of Dirleton in the County of East Lothian, and Earl of Gowrie in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, a revival of the earldom created for his kinsman in the 16th century. The latter&#x27;s grandson, the second Earl, elder son of the Honourable Patrick Hore-Ruthven, only surviving son of the first Earl, succeeded in May 1955. He notably served in the Conservative administrations under Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. As of 2021, the titles are held by his son, the 3rd Earl, who succeeded in that year. Lord Gowrie is also Chief of the Name and Arms of Ruthven. The Earl is in remainder to the lordship of Ruthven of Freeland (now held by the Earl of Carlisle).

Several other members of the Ruthven family may also be mentioned. Alexander Ruthven, third son of the first Earl of the first creation, took part in the Gowrie conspiracy of 1600, was condemned for treason and hanged, drawn and quartered. Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford, was the grandson of William Ruthven, younger son of the first Lord Ruthven. Sir John Ruthven, nephew of the Earl of Brentford, was a Major-General in the Swedish Army. His son, Francis Ruthven, was created a Baronet in 1666 (see Ruthven Baronets). The Honourable Malise Ruthven, younger brother of the second Earl of Gowrie of the second creation, is a writer and historian.

<text>Lonely Planet is a travel guide book publisher. Founded in Australia in 1973, the company has printed over 150 million books.

== History ==

===20th century===
Lonely Planet was founded by married couple Maureen and Tony Wheeler. In 1972, they embarked on an overland trip through Europe and Asia to Australia, following the route of the Oxford and Cambridge Far Eastern Expedition.

The company name originates from the misheard &quot;lovely planet&quot; in a song written by Matthew Moore. Lonely Planet&#x27;s first book, &quot;Across Asia on the Cheap&quot;, had 94 pages; it was written by the couple in their home. The original 1973 print run consisted of stapled booklets with pale blue cardboard covers.

Wheeler returned to Asia to write &quot;Across Asia on the Cheap: A Complete Guide to Making the Overland Trip&quot;, published in 1975.

The Lonely Planet guide book series initially expanded to cover other countries in Asia, with the India guide book in 1981, and expanded to rest of the world later on. Geoff Crowther was renowned for frequently inserting his opinions into the text of the guides he wrote. His writing was instrumental to the rise of Lonely Planet. The journalist used the term &quot;Geoffness&quot;, in tribute to Crowther, to describe a quality that has been lost in travel guides.

By 1999, Lonely Planet had sold 30 million copies of its travel guides. The company&#x27;s authors consequently benefited from profit-sharing and expensive events were held at the Melbourne office, at which Lonely Planet authors would arrive in limousines.

===21st century===

In 2007, the Wheelers and John Singleton sold a 75% stake in the company to BBC Worldwide, worth an estimated £63 million at the time. The company was publishing 500 titles and ventured into television production. BBC Worldwide struggled following the acquisition, registering a £3.2 million loss in the year to the end of March 2009. By the end of March 2010, profits of £1.9 million had been generated, as digital revenues had risen 37% year-on-year over the preceding 12 months, a &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; magazine had grown and non-print revenues increased from 9% in 2007 to 22%.

Lonely Planet&#x27;s digital presence included 140 apps and 8.5 million unique users for lonelyplanet.com, which hosted the Thorn Tree travel forum. In 2011, BBC Worldwide acquired the remaining 25% of the company for £42.1 million (A$67.2 million) from the Wheelers.

====BBC&#x27;s sale to NC2====

By 2012, BBC wanted to divest itself of the company and in March 2013 confirmed the sale of Lonely Planet to Brad Kelley&#x27;s NC2 Media for US$77.8 million (£51.5 million), at nearly an £80 million (US$118.89 million) loss. 

====Red Ventures====
In December 2020, NC2 Media sold Lonely Planet to Red Ventures for an undisclosed amount. Lonely Planet offices continue to operate in Dublin, Nashville and New Delhi. Phillippe von Borries, a former co-founder and CEO of Refinery29, was named head of the company.

In 2022, Lonely Planet bought Elsewhere, a website that links travellers directly with experts who assist in designing trips.

In 2024, Lonely Planet announced that it withdrew from the market in China and ceased publishing travel guides in simplified Chinese.

Lonely Planet&#x27;s online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree (&quot;Acacia xanthophloea&quot;) that has been used as a message board for the city of Nairobi, Kenya since 1902. The tree still exists in the Stanley Hotel, Nairobi. In April 2020, the forum was locked and left in read-only mode as part of Lonely Planet temporarily halting business in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2021, the Thorn Tree was shut down.

In 2009, Lonely Planet began publishing a monthly travel magazine called &quot;Lonely Planet Traveller&quot;. It is available in digital versions for a number of countries.

Lonely Planet also had its own television production company, which has produced series, such as &quot;Globe Trekker&quot;, &quot;Lonely Planet Six Degrees&quot;, and &quot;Lonely Planet: Roads Less Travelled&quot;. Toby Amies and Asha Gill (both British TV presenters) took part in Lonely Planet Six Degrees.

==Controversies==
In 1996, in response to a &quot;Visit Myanmar&quot; campaign by the Burmese military government, the Burmese opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) and its leader Aung San Suu Kyi called for a tourism boycott. As the publication of Lonely Planet&#x27;s guidebook to Myanmar (Burma) is seen by some as an encouragement to visit that country, this led to calls for a boycott of Lonely Planet. Lonely Planet&#x27;s view is that it highlights the issues surrounding a visit to the country, and that it wants to make sure that readers make an informed decision. In 2009, the NLD formally dropped its previous stance and now welcomes visitors &quot;who are keen to promote the welfare of the common people&quot;.

Lonely Planet popularity in the 21st century means a mention in a Lonely Planet guidebook is likely to inspire large numbers of travellers to that location. In 2010, for instance, Lonely Planet was blamed for the rise of what is sometimes referred to as &#x27;the Banana Pancake Trail&#x27; in Southeast Asia.

In March 2019, Lonely Planet posted a video on Facebook falsely claiming that the Banaue Rice Terraces in the Philippines were created by the Chinese, leading to criticism. The magazine later posted on Twitter in April 2019 that their Facebook video was indeed &quot;misleading&quot;, and that they would update the next Philippines book edition, but will not scrap current editions that already wrongfully state that the terraces were made by the Chinese.

==In popular culture ==
In April 2008, American writer Thomas Kohnstamm published the memoir &quot;Do Travel Writers Go to Hell?&quot; in which he described research shortcuts he employed while writing guidebooks for Lonely Planet. In a follow-up interview, he first claimed that in one case he had not even visited the country he wrote about, but subsequent to the ensuing publicity boost for his new book, Kohnstamm clarified that, in this particular edition, he was only contracted to update the five-page history section. After a review of Kohnstamm&#x27;s guidebooks, Lonely Planet&#x27;s then-publisher Piers Pickard stated that he had &quot;failed to find any inaccuracies&quot; in them.

In 2009, Australian author and former Lonely Planet guidebook writer Mic Looby published a fictional account of the guidebook writing business, titled &quot;Paradise Updated&quot;, in which the travel guide business was satirised.

<doc id="458296" wikidata="Q1277292" url="?curid=458296" title="Earl of Halifax">
<text>Earl of Halifax is a title that has been created four times in British history—once in the Peerage of England, twice in the Peerage of Great Britain, and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The name of the peerage refers to Halifax, West Yorkshire.

The first and fourth creations were elevations for the holders of the first and second creations of the title Viscount Halifax. The holder of the first creation was later granted the title Marquess of Halifax. The second and third creations were for closely related male members of the Montagu family, landed gentry since the Norman Conquest, and spanned most of the years 1689–1771.

The fourth creation was in 1944 for Lord Halifax, the former viceroy of India (who was the 3rd Viscount Halifax before his elevation to the earldom). He was a prominent 1930s minister, who declined the possibility of becoming Prime Minister on the resignation of Chamberlain, in favour of Churchill.

==History of the title==

===1679 creation===
The first creation, in the Peerage of England in 1679, was for George Savile, 1st Viscount Halifax. He had already been made Baron Savile of Elland and Viscount Halifax in 1668, and was later made Marquess of Halifax (this creation of the earldom became extinct in 1700; see Marquess of Halifax for more information).

===1714 and 1715 creations===
The title was recreated in 1714 for Charles Montagu, 1st Baron Halifax, First Lord of the Treasury to George I, along with the courtesy title of Viscount Sunbury. Both titles were created with remainder to heirs male. A member of the prominent Montagu family, he was the son of George Montagu, younger son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester (see the Duke of Manchester article). Montagu had already been created Baron Halifax, of Halifax in the County of York, in 1700, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his nephew George, son and heir of his brother Edward Montagu.

On Lord Halifax&#x27;s death in 1715 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his nephew George Montagu. Less than a month after his uncle&#x27;s death, both titles were revived in his favour, making him Earl of Halifax and Viscount Sunbury. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who was a prominent statesman. However, on his death in 1771 all the titles became extinct.

===1944 creation===
The title was created for a fourth time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1944 for Edward Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax, the former Foreign Secretary and former Viceroy of India. The Wood family descends from Francis Wood, of Barnsley. His second son, Francis Wood, was created a baronet, of Barnsley in the County of York, in 1784, with remainder to his elder brother, the Reverend Henry Wood, and failing him to the sons of his younger brother, Charles Wood (who had died two years earlier). He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet (the son of Charles Wood).

His son, the third Baronet, was a prominent Liberal politician and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1846 to 1852, during which he became notorious for the policies he followed during the Great Famine in Ireland. In 1866 he was created Viscount Halifax, of Monk Bretton in the West Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His aforementioned grandson, the third Viscount, was also a noted politician. In 1925, nine years before he succeeded his father, he was himself raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Irwin, of Kirby Underdale in the County of York. In 1944 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Halifax. the titles are held by his grandson, the third Earl, who succeeded his father in 1980.

Another member of the Wood family was the Conservative politician Richard Wood, Baron Holderness. He was the second son of the first Earl of Halifax.

The dynastic motto is &quot;I like my choice&quot;, originally &quot;Perseverando&quot; (Latin for &quot;Persevering&quot;), changed after the 1st Earl&#x27;s decision to abandon his office in the household of the Prince of Wales.

The family seat is Garrowby Hall, near Garrowby in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

<text>Earl Baldwin of Bewdley is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1937 for the Conservative politician Stanley Baldwin, who had served as MP for Bewdley from 1908 to 1937 and was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times (from 1923 to 1924, from 1924 to 1929 and from 1935 to 1937). He was made Viscount Corvedale, of Corvedale in the County of Salop, at the same time he was given the earldom.

The first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley was succeeded by his eldest son, Oliver. A somewhat controversial figure, the second Earl was a Labour Party Member of Parliament and for a time sat opposite his father in the House of Commons. Oliver had no children, so on his death the title passed to his younger brother, Arthur, the third Earl.

The peerage was held by Arthur&#x27;s son, Edward, the fourth Earl, who succeeded in 1976. He became one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sat as a cross-bencher until retiring under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 in May 2018.

Alfred Baldwin, father of the first Earl, was also a politician.

The family seat was &quot;Astley Hall&quot; near Astley, Worcestershire, and is now &quot;Manor Farm House&quot; near Wolvercote, Oxfordshire.

<text>Penelope Rosemont (born 1942 in Chicago, Illinois) is a visual artist, writer, publisher, and social activist who attended Lake Forest College. She has been a participant in the Surrealist Movement since 1965. With Franklin Rosemont, Bernard Marszalek, Robert Green and Tor
Faegre, she established the Chicago Surrealist Group in 1966. She was in 1964-1966 a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), commonly known as the Wobblies, and was part of the national staff of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in 1967-68. Her influences include Andre Breton and Guy Debord of the Situationist International, Emma Goldman and Lucy Parsons.

==Visual art==

In 1986, Penelope Rosemont&#x27;s painting the &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; was included in the Venice Biennale, selected by Arturo Schwartz to be in the Art and Alchemy section. A painter, photographer, and collagist, Rosemont is credited with having invented a number of surrealist collage methods including the &quot;landscapade&quot; and &quot;insect music&quot; [in which cut-out shapes are placed on the background of a musical score]. Rosemont is a writer and graphic designer for Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion and other publications. Her painting &quot;The Night Time is the Right Time&quot; &quot;was selected by the Chicago Jazz Institute for the 2000 Chicago Jazz Festival T-shirt&quot;. A number of Rosemont&#x27;s drawings and artwork appear in her books and are particularly abundant in &quot;Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights&quot;.

==Surrealism in and outside of Chicago==
The Rosemonts write with enthusiasm about their meeting with Andre Breton and Surrealist group members during a stay in Paris, France, in December 1965–May 1966. Penelope writes about this important period in her life in the books &quot;Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights&quot; and in her autobiographical work &quot;Dreams and Everyday Life: Andre Breton, Surrealism, Rebel Worker, SDS, &amp; the Seven Cities of Cibola, A 1960s Notebook&quot;, while Franklin discusses it in his book, &quot;An Open Entrance into the Shut Palace of Wrong Numbers&quot;. In the &quot; Surrealist Experiences&quot;, Penelope Rosemont writes about a nascent group of Surrealists that had already formed in Chicago, the Rebel Worker group, before they met Breton and, in fact, this was the impetus to go to Paris, to meet the Surrealists they had been corresponding with. She writes that the initial plan was to go to London, England, first and then to Paris; however, as she says, &quot;thanks to a mean-spirited British immigration bureaucrat&quot;, they were deported to Paris. That event was fortuitous because the surrealist exhibition &quot;L&#x27;Ecart absolu&quot; was taking place at the time; she attended a New Years Eve party organized by surrealists;and she was able to talk with Breton before he &quot;became seriously ill a few months later&quot;.

The Rosemonts are referenced in Helena Lewis&#x27;s 1988 book on Surrealism and Politics, &quot;Dada Turns Red.&quot;. There, Lewis wrote:

&quot;There was also a group of young people in Chicago in the late 1960s who made a connection between Surrealism and the old IWW, &quot;The Rebel Worker&quot; in which translations of Surrealist writing appeared . . . and they also published an art anthology of Surrealist political texts, in which the editor, Franklin Rosemont, explained how Surrealism was relevant to his movement.&quot;

In his book &quot;Freedom Dreams&quot;, published in Boston, 2002, Robin D. G. Kelley writes: “my search for an even more elaborate, complete dream of freedom...thanks to the many wonderful chance encounters with Franklin Rosemont, Penelope Rosemont, Ted Joans, Laura Corsiglia and Jayne Cortez, I discovered surrealism...right under my nose, so to speak, buried in the rich black soil of Afrodiasporic culture.” p. 4.

The Chicago Surrealist group, under their imprint Black Swan Press, published the journal &quot;Arsenal/Surrealist Subversion&quot;&#x27; sporadically from 1970 to 1989&#x27; which featured the work of Richard Huelsenbeck, Andre Breton, Georges Bataille, Ted Joans Jayne Cortez and many other Surrealists, well-known and lesser known. Franklin and Penelope Rosemont were on the editorial board, along with (for issue 4), co-editors Paul Garon, Joseph Jablonski and Philip Lamantia.

==Books: poetry, memoirs, and history==

Penelope Rosemont is the editor and wrote extensive introductions for her book &quot;Surrealist Women: An International Anthology&quot; (University of Texas, 1998), a book of over 500 pages of writing and art by women in the Surrealist movement, both past and present, dating back to the beginnings of Surrealism in the 1920s. It features Meret Oppenheim, Mary Low, Leonora Carrington, Nancy Cunard, Frida Kahlo, Dorothea Tanning, Elisa Breton, Kay Sage, Jayne Cortez, Rikki Ducornet and over one hundred more.

She is the author of &quot;Surrealist Experiences: 1001 Dawns, 221 Midnights&quot; (Black Swan Press, 2000), and books of poetry, including &quot;Beware of the Ice&quot;, and &quot;Athanor&quot; (1971).

In 1997, Black Swan Press released the book &quot;The Forecast is Hot!, and Other Collective Declarations of the Surrealist Movement in the United States&quot;, which Penelope co-authored with Franklin Rosemont and fellow Chicago Surrealist Paul Garon.

She also edited &quot;The Story of Mary MacLane &amp; Other Writings&quot; by Mary MacLane, which was re-released by Charles H. Kerr in 1998, having originally been published in 1902. MacLane has been &quot;hailed as the first &#x27;New Woman&#x27; in literature, the first flapper and a precursor of surrealism.&quot;

In 2008, her memoir came out, &quot;Dreams &amp; Everyday Life, André Breton, Surrealism, Rebel Worker, SDS &amp; the Seven Cities of Cibola&quot;, about her life in the 1960s from moving to Chicago to meeting Andre Breton in Paris, to London and back again to Chicago in 1968.

A collection of true Chicago stories, &quot;Armitage Avenue Transcendentalists&quot;, edited by Rosemont and Janina Ciezadlo, came out in 2009. Rosemont also wrote a foreword to &quot;Crime &amp; Criminals: Address to the Prisoners in the Cook County Jail &amp; Other Writings on Crime&quot; by Clarence Darrow.

In 2018, &quot;Make Love, Not War: Surrealism 1968!&quot;, co-authored with Don LaCoss and Michael Lowy, was published by Charles H. Kerr Publishing, Chicago.

&quot;Surrealism: Inside the Magnetic Fields&quot;, which recounts her experiences and historical perspective on the field of surrealism, was published by City Lights in 2019.

==Women and surrealism==

In addition to editing the anthology &quot;Surrealist Women&quot;, Rosemont has written extensively about women, including Toyen, specifically, as well as many Surrealist women, who are often omitted from the history of Surrealism, in her book &quot;Surrealist Experiences&quot;

She has also been outspoken in public discussions and articles in the promotion and defense of the women of Surrealism. By her presence in the American Surrealist movement, her activism, and her publishing, she has been one of the people who have raised the profile of women in the movement.

==Charles H. Kerr Publishing==

In 1983, she and Franklin Rosemont became directors of Charles H. Kerr &amp; Company, a publisher of books on history and Chicago history 

The Alternatives in Publication Task Force of the Social Responsibilities Round Table of the American Library Association awards the Jackie Eubanks Memorial Award, which &quot;recognizes outstanding achievement in promoting the acquisition and use of alternative materials in libraries.&quot;. In 2001, the Rosemonts and Carlos Cortez received the award for their work &quot;rescuing and re-charging&quot; Charles H. Kerr Publishing.&quot;

==Social activism==

Penelope Rosemont was a member of the IWW (Wobblies) and SDS in the 1960s. With Franklin Rosemont she compiled a collection of pamphlets, wall posters, and periodicals focusing on the IWW acquired by the Newberry Library in 2008 Her book &quot;Armitage Avenue Transcendentalists&quot; details stories in the lives of a number of activists, including famous Chicagoan Studs Terkel.

In 1977, continuing the Surrealist tradition of protesting bourgeois art, Penelope Rosemont and other surrealists were arrested for handing out leaflets as part of a Surrealist action protesting the &quot;giant billy club&quot; called the &quot;bat column&quot; on which Chicago spent $100,000 to erect the Claes Oldenburg Batcolumn.

<doc id="458308" wikidata="Q1277137" url="?curid=458308" title="Earl Peel">
<text>Earl Peel is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Peel family descends from Robert Peel, eldest son of a wealthy cotton merchant. The family lands, known as Drayton Manor, in the County of Stafford would become more commonly known in modern-day as an amusement park. The family seat is Elmire House, near Ripon, North Yorkshire.

==History==
The earldom was created in 1929 for the Conservative Party politician William Peel, 2nd Viscount Peel, who was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster 1921–1922, Secretary of State for India 1921–1922 and 1928–1929, and First Commissioner of Works 1924–1928. At the same time, he was created Viscount Clanfield, of Clanfield in the County of Southampton, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He was the son of Arthur Peel, 1st Viscount Peel, who served as Speaker of the House of Commons between 1884 and 1895, and who was created Viscount Peel, of Sandy in the County of Bedford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1895.

The first Viscount Peel was the fifth son of Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, of Drayton Manor (see below for earlier history of the family). The first Earl was succeeded by his son, Arthur Peel, 2nd Earl Peel. In 1942, he succeeded his second cousin once removed as seventh Baronet, of Drayton Manor. The second Earl later served as Lord-Lieutenant of Lancashire from 1948 to 2 January 1951. the titles are held by his son, William Peel, 3rd Earl Peel, who succeeded in 1969.

He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher. The third Earl was Lord Warden of the Stannaries from 1994 to 2006 and was Lord Chamberlain of the Household from 2006 to 2021.

The Peel family descends from Robert Peel, who established a calico-printing firm in Blackburn in 1764. His eldest son, Robert Peel, was a wealthy cotton merchant and also sat as Member of Parliament for Tamworth from 1790 to 1818. In 1800 he was created a Baronet, of Drayton Manor in the County of Stafford and of Bury in the County Palatine of Lancaster, in the Baronetage of Great Britain.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, the noted statesman. He was Home Secretary 1822–1827 and 1828–1830, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1834–1835 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1834–1835 and 1841–1846, and is best remembered for creating the modern concept of the police force while Home Secretary. The police, first known as Peelers, are still commonly referred to as Bobbies, in his name. He is also known for overseeing the formation of the Conservative Party out of the shattered Tory Party, and for the repeal of the Corn Laws. Peel died after a fall from his horse on Constitution Hill in London.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Baronet. He was also a politician and served as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1852 to 1857 and as Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1861 to 1865. His grandson, the fifth Baronet, married the actress and comedian Beatrice Lillie.

Their only son, the sixth Baronet, was an ordinary seaman in the Royal Navy and was killed in action in April 1942, aged only twenty-one. On his death the line of the eldest son of the second Baronet failed and the title was inherited by his second cousin once removed, the second Earl Peel, who became the seventh Baronet. See above for further history of the title.

<text>Airy-0 is a crater inside the larger Airy Crater on Mars, whose location historically defined the Martian prime meridian. It is about 0.5 km (0.3 mile) across and lies within the dark region Sinus Meridiani, one of the early albedo features to be identified on Mars. In 2018, the IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended setting the longitude of the Viking 1 lander (47.95137° west) as the reference line. This definition maintains the position of the center of Airy-0 at 0° longitude, within the tolerance of current cartographic uncertainties.

Merton Davies tied this crater into an extensive geodetic control network of the planet Mars based on Mariner 9 and earlier photographs. The Mariner 9 Geodesy/Cartography Group proposed that the prime meridian of Mars be defined by the center of Airy-0, which was selected by Harold Masursky, Gerard de Vaucouleurs, and Merton Davies at a Group meeting on 14 August 1972.

It was named in honor of the British Astronomer Royal Sir George Biddell Airy (1801–1892), who in 1850 built the transit circle telescope at Greenwich. The location of that telescope was subsequently chosen to define the location of Earth&#x27;s prime meridian.

<text>Frank Teschemacher (March 13, 1906 – March 1, 1932) was an American jazz clarinetist and alto-saxophonist, associated with the &quot;Austin High&quot; gang (along with Jimmy McPartland, Bud Freeman and others).

==Early life and education==
He was born in Kansas City, Missouri, but spent most of his career based in Chicago, Illinois, although gigs sometimes took him to New York City, the U.S. Midwest, and Florida.

Teschemacher was a member of the Austin High School Gang, a group of young, white musicians from the West Side of Chicago, who all attended Austin High School during the early- 1920s. They rose to prominence as pioneers of the Chicago Style in the 1920s, which was modeled on a faster version of New Orleans jazz.

==Career==

Strongly influenced by cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, Teschemacher was mainly self-taught on his instruments; early on he also doubled on violin and banjo. He started playing the clarinet professionally in 1925. He began recording under his own name in 1928 and made what are believed to be his final recordings two years later, although there is now reason to believe (via sine wave recording research, aka Smith/Westbrook Method) that he appeared on unidentified recordings as late as 1932.

His first recording was with Red McKenzie and Eddie Condon&#x27;s Chicagoans on December 9, 1927, for Okeh (&quot;Sugar&quot; and &quot;China Boy&quot;). A second session took place one week later (&quot;Nobody’s Sweetheart&quot; and &quot;Liza&quot;). The sessions included members of the Austin High School Gang: Jimmy McPartland, Bud Freeman, and Jim Lanigan, as well as Chicagoans Eddie Condon, Gene Krupa and Joe Sullivan. Red McKenzie was the session leader.

In the spring of 1928, he recorded with two other Red McKenzie and Eddie Condon groups, the Chicago Rhythm Kings and the Jungle Kings. On April 28, 1928, he made his first recordings under his own name for Brunswick Records (“Jazz Me Blues” and “Singing the Blues”). The group recorded under the name Frank Teschmacher&#x27;s Chicagoans. A test pressing of “Jazz Me Blues” was made which was released in 1939 on the United Hot Clubs of America (UHCA) label and later reissued by Decca Records.
Teschemacher&#x27;s solo work laid the groundwork for a rich sound and creative approach that is credited with influencing a young Benny Goodman and a style of which Pee Wee Russell. He also made recordings on the saxophone. Late in his career, he returned to playing violin with Jan Garber&#x27;s sweet dance orchestra during the Great Depression. 

Teschemacher was featured in episode two, &quot;The Gift&quot;, in the 2001 documentary &quot;Jazz&quot; by Ken Burns on PBS on the topic of the Austin High School Gang.

== Personal life ==
Teschemacher was killed in an automobile accident on the morning of March 1, 1932, a passenger in a car driven by his performing associate cornetist &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Davison. He was twelve days shy of what would have been his 26th birthday.

<doc id="458312" wikidata="Q77017" url="?curid=458312" title="Jakob Böhme">
<text>Jakob Böhme (; ; 24 April 1575 – 17 November 1624) was a German philosopher, Christian mystic, and Lutheran Protestant theologian. He was considered an original thinker by many of his contemporaries within the Lutheran tradition, and his first book, commonly known as &quot;Aurora&quot;, caused a great scandal. In contemporary English, his name may be spelled Jacob Boehme (retaining the older German spelling); in seventeenth-century England it was also spelled Behmen, approximating the contemporary English pronunciation of the German &quot;Böhme&quot;.

Böhme had a profound influence on later philosophical movements such as German idealism and German Romanticism. Hegel described Böhme as &quot;the first German philosopher&quot;.

==Biography==
Böhme was born on 24 April 1575 at Alt Seidenberg (now Stary Zawidów, Poland), a village near Görlitz in Upper Lusatia, a territory of the Kingdom of Bohemia. His father, George Wissen, was Lutheran, reasonably wealthy, but a peasant nonetheless. Böhme was the fourth of five children. Böhme&#x27;s first job was that of a herd boy. He was deemed to be not strong enough for husbandry. When he was 14 years old, he was sent to Seidenberg, as an apprentice to become a shoemaker. His apprenticeship for shoemaking was hard; he lived with a family who were not Christians, which exposed him to the controversies of the time. He regularly prayed and read the Bible as well as works by visionaries such as Paracelsus, Weigel and Schwenckfeld, although he received no formal education. After three years as an apprentice, Böhme left to travel. Although it is unknown just how far he went, he went at least as far as Görlitz. In 1592 Böhme returned from his journeyman years. By 1599, Böhme was master of his craft with his own premises in Görlitz. That same year he married Katharina, daughter of Hans Kuntzschmann, a butcher in Görlitz, and together he and Katharina had four sons and two daughters.

Böhme&#x27;s mentor was Abraham Behem who corresponded with Valentin Weigel. Böhme joined the &quot;Conventicle of God&#x27;s Real Servants&quot; - a parochial study group organized by Martin Moller. Böhme had a number of mystical experiences throughout his youth, culminating in a vision in 1600 as one day he focused his attention onto the exquisite beauty of a beam of sunlight reflected in a pewter dish. He believed this vision revealed to him the spiritual structure of the world, as well as the relationship between God and man, and good and evil. At the time he chose not to speak of this experience openly, preferring instead to continue his work and raise a family.

In 1610 Böhme experienced another inner vision in which he further understood the unity of the cosmos and that he had received a special vocation from God.

The shop in Görlitz, which was sold in 1613, had allowed Böhme to buy a house in 1610 and to finish paying for it in 1618. Having given up shoemaking in 1613, Böhme sold woollen gloves for a while, which caused him to regularly visit Prague to sell his wares.

==&quot;Aurora&quot; and writings==
Twelve years after the vision in 1600, Böhme began to write his first book, &quot;Morgenröte im Aufgang&quot; (&quot;Dawn of the Day in the East&quot;). The book was given the name &quot;Aurora&quot; (sometimes translated into English as &quot;The Day-spring&quot;) by a friend. Böhme originally wrote the book for himself and it was never completed. A manuscript copy of the unfinished work was lent to Karl von Ender, a nobleman, who had copies made and began to circulate them. A copy fell into the hands of , the chief pastor of Görlitz, who attacked it as being heretical, speaking against it from the pulpit, and threatened Böhme with exile if he continued working on it. Richter also wrote a pamphlet denouncing Böhme and his work.

As a result, Böhme did not write anything for several years; however, at the insistence of friends who had read &quot;Aurora&quot;, he started writing again in 1618. In 1619 Böhme wrote &quot;De Tribus Principiis&quot; or &quot;The Three Principles of the Divine Essence&quot;. It took him two years to finish his second book, which was followed by many other treatises, all of which were copied by hand and circulated only among friends. In 1620 Böhme wrote &quot;The Threefold Life of Man, Answers to Forty Questions on the Soul, The Incarnation of Jesus Christ, The Six Theosophical Points, The Six Mystical Points&quot;, the &quot;Mysterium Pansophicum&quot; and &quot;Informatorium novissimorum&quot; (&quot;Of the Last Times&quot;). In 1621 Böhme wrote &quot;De Signatura Rerum&quot; (relying in part on the doctrine of signatures). In 1623 Böhme wrote &quot;On Election to Grace, On Christ&#x27;s Testaments, Mysterium Magnum, Clavis&quot; (&quot;Key&quot;). The year 1622 saw Böhme write some short works all of which were subsequently included in his first published book on New Year&#x27;s Day 1624, under the title &quot;Weg zu Christo&quot; (&quot;The Way to Christ&quot;).

The publication caused another scandal and following complaints by the clergy, Böhme was summoned to the Town Council on 26 March 1624. The report of the meeting was that:

Böhme left for Dresden on 8 or 9 May 1624, where he stayed with the court physician for two months. In Dresden he was accepted by the nobility and high clergy. His intellect was also recognized by the professors of Dresden, who in a hearing in May 1624, encouraged Böhme to go home to his family in Görlitz. During Böhme&#x27;s absence his family had suffered due to the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

Once home, Böhme accepted an invitation to stay with Herr von Schweinitz, who had a country-seat. While there Böhme began to write his last book, the &quot;177 Theosophic Questions&quot;. Böhme fell terminally ill with a bowel complaint forcing him to travel home on 7 November. Gregorius Richter, Böhme&#x27;s adversary from Görlitz, had died in August 1624, while Böhme was away. The new clergy, still wary of Böhme, forced him to answer a long list of questions when he wanted to receive the sacrament. He died on 17 November 1624.

In this short period, Böhme produced an enormous amount of writing, including his major works &quot;De Signatura Rerum&quot; (&quot;The Signature of All Things&quot;) and &quot;Mysterium Magnum&quot;. He also developed a following throughout Europe, where his followers were known as Behmenists.

The son of Böhme&#x27;s chief antagonist, the pastor primarius of Görlitz Gregorius Richter, edited a collection of extracts from his writings, which were afterwards published complete at Amsterdam with the help of Coenraad van Beuningen in the year 1682. Böhme&#x27;s full works were first printed in 1730.

==Theology==

The chief concern of Böhme&#x27;s writing was the nature of sin, evil and redemption. Consistent with Lutheran theology, Böhme preached that humanity had fallen from a state of divine grace to a state of sin and suffering, that the forces of evil included fallen angels who had rebelled against God, and that God&#x27;s goal was to restore the world to a state of grace.

There are some serious departures from accepted Lutheran theology, such as his rejection of justification by faith alone, as in this passage from &quot;The Way to Christ&quot;:

For he that will say, &quot;I have a Will, and would willingly do Good, but the earthly Flesh which I carry about me, keepeth me back, so that I cannot; yet I shall be saved by Grace, for the Merits of Christ. I comfort myself with his Merit and Sufferings; who will receive me of mere Grace, without any Merits of my own, and forgive me my Sins&quot;. Such a one, I say, is like a Man that knoweth what Food is good for his Health, yet will not eat of it, but eateth Poison instead thereof, from whence Sickness and Death, will certainly follow.

Another place where Böhme may depart from accepted theology (though this was open to question due to his somewhat obscure, oracular style) was in his description of the Fall as a necessary stage in the evolution of the Universe. A difficulty with his theology is the fact that he had a mystical vision, which he reinterpreted and reformulated. According to F. von Ingen, to Böhme, in order to reach God, man has to go through hell first. God exists without time or space, he regenerates himself through eternity. Böhme restates the trinity as truly existing but with a novel interpretation. God, the Father is fire, who gives birth to his son, whom Böhme calls light. The Holy Spirit is the living principle, or the divine life.

It is clear that Böhme never claimed that God sees evil as desirable, necessary or as part of divine will to bring forth good. In his &quot;Threefold Life&quot;, Böhme states: &quot;[I]n the order of nature, an evil thing cannot produce a good thing out of itself, but one evil thing generates another.&quot; Böhme did not believe that there is any &quot;divine mandate or metaphysically inherent necessity for evil and its effects in the scheme of things.&quot; Dr. John Pordage, a commentator on Böhme, wrote that Böhme &quot;whensoever he attributes evil to eternal nature considers it in its fallen state, as it became infected by the fall of Lucifer... .&quot; Evil is seen as &quot;the disorder, rebellion, perversion of making spirit nature&#x27;s servant&quot;, which is to say a perversion of initial Divine order.

Böhme&#x27;s correspondences in &quot;Aurora&quot; of the seven qualities, planets and humoral-elemental associations:

# Dry - Saturn - melancholy, power of death;
# Sweet - Jupiter - sanguine, gentle source of life;
# Bitter - Mars - choleric, destructive source of life;
# Fire - Sun/Moon - night/day; evil/good; sin/virtue; Moon, later = phlegmatic, watery;
# Love - Venus - love of life, spiritual rebirth;
# Sound - Mercury - keen spirit, illumination, expression;
# Corpus - Earth - totality of forces awaiting rebirth.

In &quot;De Tribus Principiis&quot; or &quot;On the Three Principles of Divine Being&quot; Böhme subsumed the seven principles into the Trinity:

# The &quot;dark world&quot; of the Father (Qualities 1-2-3);
# The &quot;light world&quot; of the Holy Spirit (Qualities 5-6-7);
# &quot;This world&quot; of Satan and Christ (Quality 4).

===Cosmology===
In one interpretation of Böhme&#x27;s cosmology, it was necessary for humanity to return to God, and for all original unities to undergo differentiation, desire and conflict—as in the rebellion of Satan, the separation of Eve from Adam and their acquisition of the knowledge of good and evil—in order for creation to evolve to a new state of redeemed harmony that would be more perfect than the original state of innocence, allowing God to achieve a new self-awareness by interacting with a creation that was both part of, and distinct from, Himself. Free will becomes the most important gift God gives to humanity, allowing us to seek divine grace as a deliberate choice while still allowing us to remain individuals.

===Marian views===
Böhme believed that the Son of God became human through the Virgin Mary. Before the birth of Christ, God recognized himself as a virgin. This virgin is therefore a mirror of God&#x27;s wisdom and knowledge. Böhme follows Luther in that he views Mary within the context of Christ. Unlike Luther, he does not address himself to dogmatic issues very much, but to the human side of Mary. Like all other women, she was human and therefore subject to sin. Only after God elected her with his grace to become the mother of his son, did she inherit the status of sinlessness. &quot;Mary did not move the Word, the Word moved Mary&quot;, so Böhme, explaining that all her grace came from Christ. Mary is &quot;blessed among women&quot; but not because of her qualifications, but because of her humility. Mary is an instrument of God; an example of what God can do: It shall not be forgotten in all eternity, that God became human in her.

Böhme, unlike Luther, did not believe that Mary was the &quot;Ever Virgin&quot;. Her virginity after the birth of Jesus is unrealistic to Böhme. The true salvation is Christ, not Mary. The importance of Mary, a human like every one of us, is that she gave birth to Jesus Christ as a human being. If Mary had not been human, according to Böhme, Christ would be a stranger and not our brother. Christ must grow in us as he did in Mary. She became blessed by accepting Christ. In a reborn Christian, as in Mary, all that is temporal disappears and only the heavenly part remains for all eternity. Böhme&#x27;s peculiar theological language, involving fire, light and spirit, which permeates his theology and Marian views, does not distract much from the fact that his basic positions are Lutheran.

===Influences===

Böhme&#x27;s writing shows the influence of Neoplatonist and alchemical writers such as Paracelsus, while remaining firmly within a Christian tradition. He has in turn greatly influenced many anti-authoritarian and mystical movements, such as Radical Pietism (including the Ephrata Cloister and Society of the Woman in the Wilderness), the Religious Society of Friends, the Philadelphians, the Gichtelians, the Harmony Society, the Zoarite Separatists, Rosicrucianism, Martinism and Christian theosophy. Böhme&#x27;s disciple and mentor, the Liegnitz physician Balthasar Walther, who had travelled to the Holy Land in search of magical, kabbalistic and alchemical wisdom, also introduced kabbalistic ideas into Böhme&#x27;s thought. Böhme was also an important source of German Romantic philosophy, influencing Schelling in particular.

In Richard Bucke&#x27;s 1901 treatise &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot;, special attention was given to the profundity of Böhme&#x27;s spiritual enlightenment, which seemed to reveal to Böhme an ultimate nondifference, or nonduality, between human beings and God. Jakob Böhme&#x27;s writings also had some influence on the modern theosophical movement of the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge wrote about Jakob Böhme&#x27;s philosophy. Böhme was also an important influence on the ideas of Franz Hartmann, the founder in 1886 of the German branch of the Theosophical Society. Hartmann described the writings of Böhme as “the most valuable and useful treasure in spiritual literature.”

== Behmenism ==

Behmenism, also Behemenism or Boehmenism, is the English-language designation for a 17th-century European Christian movement based on the teachings of German mystic and theosopher Jakob Böhme (1575-1624). The term was not usually applied by followers of Böhme&#x27;s theosophy to themselves, but rather was used by some opponents of Böhme&#x27;s thought as a polemical term. The origins of the term date back to the German literature of the 1620s, when opponents of Böhme&#x27;s thought, such as the Thuringian antinomian Esajas Stiefel, the Lutheran theologian Peter Widmann and others denounced the writings of Böhme and the &quot;Böhmisten&quot;. When his writings began to appear in England in the 1640s, Böhme&#x27;s surname was irretrievably corrupted to the form &quot;Behmen&quot; or &quot;Behemen&quot;, whence the term &quot;Behmenism&quot; developed. A follower of Böhme&#x27;s theosophy is a &quot;Behmenist&quot;.

Behmenism does not describe the beliefs of any single formal religious sect, but instead designates a more general description of Böhme&#x27;s interpretation of Christianity, when used as a source of devotional inspiration by a variety of groups. Böhme&#x27;s views greatly influenced many anti-authoritarian and Christian mystical movements, such as the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), the Philadelphians, the Gichtelians, the Society of the Woman in the Wilderness (led by Johannes Kelpius), the Ephrata Cloister, the Harmony Society, Martinism, and Christian theosophy. Böhme was also an important source of German Romantic philosophy, influencing Schelling and Franz von Baader in particular. In Richard Bucke&#x27;s 1901 treatise &quot;Cosmic Consciousness&quot;, special attention was given to the profundity of Böhme&#x27;s spiritual enlightenment, which seemed to reveal to Böhme an ultimate nondifference, or nonduality, between human beings and God. Böhme is also an important influence on the ideas of the English Romantic poet, artist and mystic William Blake. After having seen the William Law edition of the works of Jakob Böhme, published between 1764 and 1781, in which some illustrations had been included by the German early Böhme exegetist Dionysius Andreas Freher (1649–1728), William Blake said during a dinner party in 1825 &quot;Michel Angelo could not have surpassed them&quot;.

Despite being based on a corrupted form of Böhme&#x27;s surname, the term Behmenism has retained a certain utility in modern English-language historiography, where it is still occasionally employed, although often to designate specifically English followers of Böhme&#x27;s theosophy. Given the transnational nature of Böhme&#x27;s influence, the term at least implies manifold international connections between Behmenists. In any case, the term is preferred to clumsier variants such as &quot;Böhmeianism&quot; or &quot;Böhmism&quot;, although these may also be encountered.

==Reaction==
In addition to the scientific revolution, the 17th century was a time of mystical revolution in Catholicism, Protestantism and Judaism. The Protestant revolution developed from Böhme and some medieval mystics. Böhme became important in intellectual circles in Protestant Europe, following from the publication of his books in England, Holland and Germany in the 1640s and 1650s. Böhme was especially important for the Millenarians and was taken seriously by the Cambridge Platonists and Dutch Collegiants. Henry More was critical of Böhme and claimed he was not a real prophet, and had no exceptional insight into metaphysical questions. Overall, although his writings did not influence political or religious debates in England, his influence can be seen in more esoteric forms such as on alchemical experimentation, metaphysical speculation and spiritual contemplation, as well as utopian literature and the development of neologisms. More, for example, dismissed &quot;Opera Posthuma&quot; by Spinoza as a return to Behmenism.

While Böhme was famous across Western Europe and North America during the 17th century, he became less influential during the 18th century. A revival occurred late in that century with interest from German Romantics, who considered Böhme a forerunner to the movement. Poets such as John Milton, Ludwig Tieck, Novalis, William Blake and W. B. Yeats found inspiration in Böhme&#x27;s writings. Coleridge, in his &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;, speaks of Böhme with admiration. Böhme was highly thought of by the German philosophers Baader, Schelling and Schopenhauer. Hegel went as far as to say that Böhme was &quot;the first German philosopher&quot;. Danish Bishop Hans Lassen Martensen published a book about Böhme.

Several authors have found Boehme&#x27;s description of the three original Principles and the seven Spirits to be similar to the Law of Three and the Law of Seven described in the works of Boris Mouravieff and George Gurdjieff.

There is no sorrowing. For sorrow is a thing that is swallowed up in death, and death and dying are the very life of the darkness.&quot;

<text>Nicholas John Currie (born 11 February 1960), more popularly known under the artist name Momus (after the Greek god of mockery), is a Scottish musician and writer.

For over forty years he has been releasing albums on labels in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan. In his lyrics and his other writing he makes use of continental philosophy, and has built up a personal world he says is &quot;dominated by values like diversity, orientalism, and a respect for otherness&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Musical ===
Nicholas Currie&#x27;s musical career began in 1981, with his band The Happy Family, featuring ex-members of Josef K, who made a single and a concept album &quot;The Man on Your Street: Songs of the Dictator Hall&quot; on hip UK indie label 4AD.

In 1986 Momus recorded an E.P. of his translations of Jacques Brel songs, &quot;Nicky&quot;, and wrote a lengthy article on Brel for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. On 22 October 2009 he performed at the Barbican alongside fellow Brel enthusiasts Marc Almond and Camille O&#x27;Sullivan at a celebration of Brel&#x27;s career &quot;Carousel: The Songs of Jacques Brel&quot;.

His album &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Night&quot; included the single, &quot;The Hairstyle of the Devil&quot;, which peaked at No. 94 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1989, and was also a local hit at San Francisco&#x27;s KITS Live 105 radio station.

Momus&#x27; 1980s albums were a great influence on Jarvis Cocker, who wrote to Currie asking him to produce future Pulp albums. Those same albums were a huge influence on Brett Anderson, Currie&#x27;s championing of Suede following his friendship with Anderson and particularly bass player Justine Frischmann got them early attention, before she left to form Elastica. Momus also features in &quot;Bad Vibes&quot; the memoir of Luke Haines&#x27;s whom Currie dubbed &#x27;The Hitler of Britpop&#x27;.

In the early 1990s, Momus struck up a working relationship with a number of J-Pop stars. A cult audience for Momus and the indie labels he had released his early records on - particularly el records - led to the formation community of musicians in Shibuya, Tokyo, and the founding of Cru-el records, and the emergence of Shibuya-kei artists such as Cornelius and The Poison Girlfriend - who performed Momus songs. Currie began writing specifically for nOrikO (aka the Poison Girlfriend) and Kahimi Karie. In 1995 Kahimi Karie&#x27;s Momus-penned song &quot;Good Morning World&quot; went to number one and was featured in a heavily syndicated advert, giving Currie his first real hit and financial stability for the first time.

Momus has continued to release music regularly. His 2020 album, &quot;Vivid&quot;, which documented the COVID-19 pandemic and Momus&#x27; own suspected case of the virus, earned some coverage in the mainstream media.

He has been the subject of a number of documentaries including Hannu Puttonen&#x27;s &quot;Man of Letters&quot;.

===As author===
Momus has published a book of lyrics, and has written texts or introductions for several books on art and culture.

Momus has published six novels. &quot;The Book of Jokes&quot; and &quot;The Book of Scotlands&quot; received positive reviews in the &quot;LA Times&quot; and the &quot;Guardian.&quot; &quot;The Book of Scotlands&quot; (Sternberg Press) was shortlisted for the Scottish Arts Council&#x27;s First Book prize. He published &quot;The Book of Japans&quot; in 2011, also on Sternberg Press, and &quot;UnAmerica&quot; in 2014, as well as several ebooks.

2020 saw the publication of &quot;Niche: a memoir in pastiche&quot; in which Momus tells the story of his creative life through fictional eyewitness statements from famous historic figures.

Momus said in 1991 that &quot;In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen people&quot;, which has evolved into a meme, &quot;On the web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people&quot;. The quip parodies Andy Warhol&#x27;s famous prediction that, &quot;In the future, everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes&quot;.

From 15 January 2004 to 10 February 2010, Momus wrote a blog on the LiveJournal platform called &quot;Click Opera.&quot; Initially a collection of links, &quot;Click Opera&quot; evolved to become a substantial daily cultural essay. After announcing it unexpectedly in an interview with magazine called &quot;Chronic&#x27;art&quot;, Momus ended the blog on his fiftieth birthday because it had become too time-consuming and because Livejournal was being wound down. It is cited a high point of the blogging era and led to Momus becoming a columnist with the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;.

Since 2016, Momus has been releasing a series of improvised lectures and travel vlogs called &quot;Open University.&quot;

== Lawsuits ==
In 1991 following the release of the album &quot;Hippopotamomus&quot; Momus was threatened with legal action by the Michelin tyre company for his song &quot;Michelin Man&quot; which imagined the company&#x27;s Bibendum mascot as a metaphor for hypersexual rubber fetishism. Remaining copies of the album were destroyed, the track was withdrawn from subsequent pressings of the album, and the album&#x27;s cover was amended to remove a hippo-headed pastiche of the Michelin Man character. The lyrics to the track were included in the lyric book &quot;Lusts of a Moron&quot; under the amended title &quot;Made of Rubber&quot;. The 2018 box set &quot;Recreate&quot; restored both the track and title, with the accompanying booklet by Anthony Reynolds &quot;Sons of Pioneers&quot;, detailing the legal wrangle but not explaining the track&#x27;s reinstatement.

In 1998, Momus was sued by the composer/musician Wendy Carlos for $22 million for his song &quot;Walter Carlos&quot; (from the album &quot;The Little Red Songbook&quot;, released that year), which postulated that the post–sexual reassignment surgery Wendy could travel back in time to marry her pre-surgery self. The case was settled out of court, with Momus agreeing to remove the song from subsequent editions of the CD and owing $30,000 in legal fees. Momus&#x27; following album &quot;Stars Forever&quot; consisted of commissioned biographical sketches in the style of the Wendy Carlos song, conceived as a crowdfunding exercise to pay Currie&#x27;s legal fees.

== Personal life ==
Currie attended boarding school at the Edinburgh Academy while his father taught English for the British Council in Athens.

Since 1984 Momus has lived in London, Paris, Tokyo, New York, Berlin and Osaka. He currently splits his time between Berlin and Paris. He is an atheist.

In 1994, at the age of 34, he married his 17-year-old girlfriend. She was 14 when they first corresponded by fan mail but 16 when they became romantically involved. They separated in 1997 and divorced amicably in 1999.

In December 1997, he contracted acanthamoeba keratitis in his right eye due to a contact lens mishap sustained while on holiday in Greece, causing loss of vision on that side. Although his sight subsequently improved following surgery, he has suffered lingering effects from the infection since, causing him to often be photographed in an eyepatch, wearing dark glasses, or squinting.

His cousin is musician Justin Currie, the lead singer and songwriter of Del Amitri.

<text>Giocangga (Manchu: ; ; 1526–1583) was the son of Fuman and the paternal grandfather of Nurhaci, the man who unified the Jurchen peoples and founded the Later Jin dynasty of China. Both he and his son Taksi attacked Atai&#x27;s fort, which was being besieged by a rival Jurchen chieftain Nikan Wailan (; 尼堪外蘭 &quot;Níkān Wàilán&quot;), who promised the governance of the city to whoever would kill Atai. One of Atai&#x27;s underlings rebelled and murdered him. Both Giocangga and Taksi were killed by Nikan Wailan under unclear circumstances. Giocangga, Taksi and Nikan were all under command of Li Chengliang. 

Giocangga was accorded the temple name Jǐngzǔ (景祖) and the posthumous name Emperor Yi (翼皇帝) by the Qing dynasty.

In 2005, a study led by a researcher at the British Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute suggested that Giocangga might be a direct male-line ancestor of over 1.5 million men, mostly in northeastern China. This was attributed to Giocangga&#x27;s and his descendants&#x27; many wives and concubines. Giocangga&#x27;s descendants in the patrilineal line are concentrated among several ethnic minorities who were part of the Manchu Eight Banners system, and are not found in the Han population.

<text>Jesse Harding Pomeroy (; November 29, 1859 – September 29, 1932) was a convicted American murderer and possible serial killer and the youngest person in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to be convicted of murder in the first degree. He was found guilty by a jury trial held in the Supreme Judicial Court of Suffolk County in December 1874.

==Background==
Jesse Harding Pomeroy was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, to Thomas Jesse Pomeroy and Ruth Ann Snowman. He was the second of two sons.

== Early attacks ==
On February 21, 1872, a seven-year-old named Tracy Hayden of Chelsea was beaten and left on Powder Horn Hill. On May 20, an eight-year-old boy, Robert Maier, was also beaten and left in an abandoned outhouse in Chelsea. On July 22, Johnny Balch was discovered tied up and beaten in an abandoned outhouse on Powder Horn Hill.

Soon after the third attack, the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that &quot;the public are considerably excited&quot; about what they described as a &quot;Fiendish Boy&quot; who was violently attacking younger children.

Around August 2, 1872, Ruth Ann Pomeroy and her children moved from their home in Chelsea to Broadway Street in the South Boston area. By this point, Thomas Pomeroy had abandoned his family.

A fourth attack against a young child occurred August 17, 1872. Seven-year-old George Pratt was found beaten by local fishermen in South Boston. Barely a month later, on September 11, another seven-year-old boy, Joseph Kennedy, was assaulted. He was supposedly lured to a vacant boathouse near the South Boston salt marshes; once there, he was beaten and cut with a pocketknife.

Six days later, on September 17, railway workers walking along the Hartford and Erie Line in South Boston stumbled upon Robert Gould, a five-year-old boy, who had been tied to a telegraph post near the tracks, beaten, and slashed by a knife.

A while after the last attack, Pomeroy was walking past South Boston&#x27;s Police Station Six and decided to look in the window. Joseph Kennedy, the child who had been assaulted on September 11, was inside. He spotted Pomeroy looking through the window and pointed him out to the officers as his assailant.

Pomeroy was immediately arrested and readily admitted to being the &quot;boy torturer&quot;. Eventually, the rest of the children who had been assaulted throughout the year all identified Pomeroy as their attacker.

On September 21, 1872, Jesse Pomeroy was arraigned and heard in front of Juvenile Court Judge William G. Forsaith. The 13-year-old Pomeroy confessed to the attacks, was found guilty, and sentenced to six years at the State Reform School for Boys in Westborough, Massachusetts.

== Crimes ==

In February 1874, at the age of 14, Pomeroy was paroled back to his mother and brother in South Boston. His mother ran her own dressmaking shop, and his brother Charles sold newspapers.

In March 1874, a 10-year-old girl from South Boston named Katie Curran went missing. On April 22, 1874, the mutilated body of a 4-year-old boy named Horace Millen was found on the marsh of Dorchester Bay. Immediately, the police detectives sought out Pomeroy, despite lacking evidence implicating him in the crime. The body of Katie Curran was found later, in the basement of Pomeroy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s dress shop. Her remains were hastily and carelessly concealed in an ash heap.

== Trial ==
Pomeroy was taken to view Millen&#x27;s body and asked if he committed the murder. At the coroner&#x27;s inquest, Pomeroy was denied the right to counsel. 

The case of &quot;Commonwealth v. Pomeroy&quot; was heard in the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (Suffolk County, Boston) on December 9th and 10th, 1874. At the trial, the Attorney General argued for a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. In his closing arguments, he urged an alternative charge of murder with extreme atrocity, which, according to Massachusetts law, is first-degree murder, but differs from the original charge in the requirement of premeditation. 

Pomeroy was pronounced guilty on December 10, 1874, with the jury&#x27;s recommendation of mercy on account of the prisoner&#x27;s youth. 

Pomeroy&#x27;s attorney, Charles Robinson, filed two exceptions which were overruled in February 1875, at which point Pomeroy was sentenced to death by hanging. 

== After the trial ==

It remained for the Governor to sign the death warrant and assign a date for Pomeroy&#x27;s execution. However, Governor William Gaston refused to comply with this executive responsibility. The only legal means of sparing Pomeroy&#x27;s life was through the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, and only if a simple majority of the nine-member Council voted to commute the death penalty. Over the next year and a half, the Council voted three times: the first two votes upheld Pomeroy&#x27;s execution, and both times Governor Gaston refused to sign the death warrant.

In August 1876, the Council took a third vote, anonymously, and Pomeroy&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life in prison in solitary confinement. On the evening of September 7, 1876, Pomeroy was transferred from the Suffolk County Jail to the State Prison at Charlestown, and began his life in solitary. He was 16 years and 9 months old. Pomeroy remained incarcerated at the Charlestown State Prison.

In prison, Pomeroy claimed that he taught himself to read several foreign languages, including Hebrew; and one visiting psychiatrist found that he had learned German with &quot;considerable accuracy&quot;. He wrote poetry and argued with prison officials over his right to have it published, and he studied law books and spent decades composing legal challenges to his conviction and requests for a pardon. A psychiatric report on Pomeroy made in 1914, and quoted extensively in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; after his death, noted that Pomeroy had made 10 or 12 &quot;determined attempts&quot; to escape and that handmade tools were frequently found in his possession.

A prison warden reported finding rope, steel pens, and a drill that Pomeroy had concealed in his cell or on his person. According to &quot;The Globe&quot;, Pomeroy lost an eye after attempting to destroy the side of his cell by redirecting a gas pipe. The 1914 psychiatric report claimed that Pomeroy had shown the &quot;greatest ingenuity and a persistence which is unprecedented in the history of the prison.&quot;

In 1917, with the support of District Attorney Joseph Pelletier, Pomeroy&#x27;s sentence was commuted to the extent of allowing him the privileges afforded to other life prisoners. At first, he resisted, wanting nothing less than a pardon. He eventually adjusted to his changed circumstances and appeared in a minstrel show at the prison. In 1929, by this time an elderly man in frail health, he was transferred to Bridgewater Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where he died on September 29, 1932.
