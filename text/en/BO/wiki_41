<text>SABC 2 is a South African free-to-air television channel owned by the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC).

As of March 2024, SABC 2 broadcasts programming only in English, Venda, Tsonga, Sotho, Sepedi &amp; Setswana.

As of August 2018, the channel started broadcasting in high definition.

==History==
South Africa was already served by some closed-circuit systems in hotels before SABC-TV started. SABC began airing test cards in early 1975 on its transmitters and started trialling its first television service on 5 May 1975 in South Africa&#x27;s largest cities, and officially launched its first television channel on 6 January 1976 under the name SABC Television/SAUK-Televisie. The launch of SABC-TV caused South Africa to become the last country in the industrialised world to introduce television and had a viewership base of one million. Around 222,000 television sets were tuned in to the inauguration. As with other countries, the launch of television had negative effects in other sectors of the country&#x27;s entertainment industry, especially cinemas. Within the corporation, SABC&#x27;s regional radio stations would suffer from loss of listeners to the new television network, but Radio 5&#x27;s playlists remained unchanged.

The service opened at 6pm with a bilingual opening speech presented by Heinrich Maritz (Afrikaans) and Dorianne Berry (English), the culmination of a five-year project. The first programme seen was a special presentation from the Children&#x27;s and Youth division, in Afrikaans, which presented Haas Kas and other characters produced by the unit. The English-language The Everywhere Express, which had been shown in the test service the previous year, was also introductory in nature.

The official opening of the service was at 8pm with a speech from Prime Minister John Vorster.

As of 1977, the SABC-TV service was delivered over eighteen transmitters:
*Alverstone-Durban-Pinetown: channel 4
*Bloemfontein: channel 9
*Cape Town: channel 8
*Davel-Bethal-Ermelo: channel 22 (UHF)
*East London: channel 9
*George Mosselbay: channel 5
*Glencoe-Dundee: channel 27 (UHF)
*Hartbeesfontein-Klerksdorp: channel 45 (UHF)
*Johannesburg: channel 13
*Kimberley: channel 4
*Kroonstad: channel 57 (UHF)
*Middelburg-Witbank: channel 41 (UHF)
*Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage: channel 7
*Port Shepstone-Margate: channel 8
*Pretoria: channel 5
*Theunissen: channel 5
*Villiersdorp: channel 7
*Welverdiend-Potchefstroom: channel 7

Two years after launch, a South African Sunday newspaper called the service &quot;prissy and pricey&quot;: &quot;prissy&quot; due to the strict moral standards of the SABC and &quot;pricey&quot; due to the high costs of both buying a television set and paying the licence fee. The introduction of television advertising would at the time threaten advertisers in newspapers. The schedule lasted for five hours (6pm to 11pm, earlier closing on Sunday nights) with a few hours of sports on Saturdays. On a technical level, the SABC claimed to have the highest standards, but not at programming level. The service was also touted as a propaganda vehicle for the then-ruling National Party.

By 1979, the broadcasts were picked up by 80% of the white population and 42% of the black population.

On 1 January 1982, two television channels were introduced: TV2 broadcasting in Zulu and Xhosa and TV3 broadcasting in Sotho and Tswana, both targeted at a Black urban audience and broadcasting on the same television frequency. The main network, now called TV1, divided its broadcasting languages evenly between English and Afrikaans, as before. In 1986, a new service called TV4 was introduced, carrying sports and entertainment programming, also timesharing with TV2 and TV3 on the same frequency, which stopped broadcasting at 9:30pm.

In 1991, TV2, TV3 and TV4 were merged into a new full-fledged network, CCV (Contemporary Community Values). A separate network was introduced, TopSport Surplus (TSS), with TopSport being the brand name for the SABC&#x27;s sport coverage. However, it was replaced by NNTV (National Network TV), an educational non-commercial channel in 1994. 

An agreement was signed with Sky News on 21 September 1993, enabling TV1 to air the channel during off-air hours from 15 October that year, akin to sister channel CCV which already had a contract with CNN International. In 1994, with post-Apartheid democratisation, it was suggested that TV1 should broadcast entirely in English. At this time, the channel&#x27;s slogan was &quot;This one&#x27;s for you!&quot; ( in Afrikaans). Ethnic mixing was now possible; its morning show &quot;Good Morning South Africa&quot; now had a whiteman and a black woman side by side, impossible in Apartheid days.

In 1996, the SABC reorganised its three TV networks with the aim of making them more representative of the various language groups. These were renamed to SABC 3 (formerly TV1), SABC 1 (formerly CCV) and SABC 2 (formerly NNTV). The amount of time allocated to Afrikaans-language programming on the new channel (SABC 2) fell from 50% to 15% - a move that alienated Afrikaans speakers. A spokesman for the SABC said that such a reduction was &quot;inevitable in the post apartheid era&quot;, and that the SABC had not abided to the IBA&#x27;s recommendations.

Under the new format, 40% of SABC 2&#x27;s schedule was in English, with the remaining 60% given to the other languages. The new service catered at Afrikaans and Sotho speakers during prime time, all-day language breakdown was as of the time of the change: 41% English, 15% Afrikaans, 8% Sepedi, 6% Sesotho, 8% Setswana and 1% each for Xitsonga and Tshivenda. 21% of its programming was multilingual.

With the commercialisation of the SABC in July 1997, the channel decided to drop its loss-making breakfast show &quot;Good Morning South Africa&quot; that it had inherited from the Apartheid-era TV1. In late 1997, the SABC announced that the channel would house more public service programming. On 1 December that year, SABC 2 adopted a new look.

For 2002, the channel was committed to be &quot;the voice, the heart and the mind of South Africans&quot;, owing to its broadcast footprint - the largest out of any SABC terrestrial network. Aiming at increasing its audiences in the Black and Afrikaans sectors, the channel sought to increase its local offering, reflecting individual South African cultures and communities. Three new projects were being developed, The Res, Dark City and Zero Tolerance. 7de Laan increased its number of weekly episodes to four, while Muvhango was planned to enter its third season in April that year.

== Programming ==
After the SABC restructured its television channels, SABC 2 took the place of the old TV1 channel. The reduced prominence of Afrikaans angered many speakers of the language, although the channel still features a significant amount of Afrikaans programming, including a news broadcast every week night at 19:00 and weekends at 18:00.

M-Net seeing the market need, launched the Afrikaans subscription channel KykNet in 1999 and followed in 2005 with the music channel MK (originally known as MK89.) In 2009, M-Net launched Koowee, a kids channel broadcasting in Afrikaans.

=== Soapies, dramas and telenovelas ===
The channel is popular for its two longest-running soapies &quot;7de Laan&quot; and &quot;Muvhango&quot;, dramas such as &quot;Erfsondes&quot;, &quot;Geraamtes in die Kas&quot;, &quot;Roer Jou Voete&quot; and &quot;90 Plein Street&quot;, and Telenovelas such as &quot;Keeping Score&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Die Sentrum&quot;.

=== Series ===
SABC 2 has in the past, broadcast international series such as &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. However, the channel is currently focused on local reality and actuality series such as &quot;Speak Out&quot;, &quot;Relate&quot;, and &quot;Saving Our Marriage&quot;, comedies such as &quot;Ga Re Dumele&quot; and &quot;Ke Ba Bolleletse&quot;, and a few international series such as &quot;American Ninja Warrior&quot;.

=== Sports ===
SABC 2 rarely broadcasts live sports due to funding issues, and instead focuses on sporting highlights. It is mostly focused on boxing, rugby, swimming and athletics.

=== News and current affairs ===
The channel provides two primetime bulletins for the TshiVenda/xiTsonga, and Sotho/Setswana/Sepedi languages. In addition, it has current affairs programmes including &quot;Ngula Ya Vutivi&quot;, &quot;Zwa Maramani&quot; and &quot;Leihlo La Sechaba&quot;. It also airs the longest-running breakfast show &quot;Morning Live&quot;. It is known for national events such as presidential inaugurations, State of the Nation Address, Budget Speeches, and parliamentary events. On 4 March 2024, the Afrikaans bulletin has been moved to SABC 3 on Mondays to Fridays @ 20:30 and Weekends @ 18:15.

=== Movies ===
The channel is known for family-friendly and dramatic movies, autobiographies and animated movies.

=== Youth and education ===

SABC 2 has a roster of shows from its SABC Education slate, most notably &quot;Takalani Sesame&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s For Life&quot;, &quot;The Epic Hangout&quot;, among others, and also brings educational shows on how to manage money and a focus on senior citizens, as well as other children&#x27;s shows from Disney Junior, either in their original English soundtrack or dubbed in South African languages, such as &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; in isiZulu, &quot;Ben 10&quot; in Afrikaans and &quot;Doc McStuffins&quot; in Sotho.

<doc id="453996" wikidata="Q7896177" url="?curid=453996" title="University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez">
<text>The University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez Campus (UPRM) or Recinto Universitario de Mayag√ºez (RUM) in Spanish (also referred to as Colegio and CAAM in allusion to its former name), is a public land-grant university in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico. The UPRM is the second-largest university campus of the University of Puerto Rico system, a member of the sea-grant, and the space-grant research consortia. 

In 2009, the campus population was composed of 12,108 students, 1,924 regular staff members, and 1,037 members of the education staff. In 2013, the student population remained relatively steady at 11,838, but the instructional faculty dropped to 684. In the second semester of 2019 around 12,166 students were enrolled. By the end of the academic year 2022-2023 there were 10,071 students enrolled. UPRM has been accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) since 1946.

==History==
The University of Puerto Rico was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly on March 12, 1903, emerging as an outgrowth of the Normal School, which had been established three years earlier to train teachers for the Puerto Rican school system. In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson Act declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the university. Evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at R√≠o Piedras in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at Mayag√ºez in 1911 as a land-grant university.

The founding of the institution is credited to D.W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), Jos√© de Diego and Carmelo Alemar. In 1912 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or &quot;Colegio de Agricultura y Artes Mec√°nicas&quot; (CAAM).

In 1918, an earthquake and a fire caused significant damage to the institution. The ruins of the entrance of one of the buildings, Degetau Hall ‚Äî which not only withstood the earthquake, but proved to be almost indestructible after the rebuilt hall was torn down in the late 1950s ‚Äî would later become the emblem of the institution. In 1988, the archway (the portico) was rebuilt, landscaped and turned into a monument.

The campus rectory was located at the Jos√© de Diego building, the oldest standing edification within the campus, built in 1911. The building was inscribed in the National Historic Building Registry as an architectural patrimony. In 1940, a clock tower was built into the main building. In 1993, the building underwent a restoration.

In 1929, the Liga Atl√©tica Interuniversitaria was created at the Mayag√ºez campus. The LAI is an athletic organization, similar to the NCAA, created with the purpose of promoting and regulating sports activities. It originally consisted of a three event competition: basketball, baseball and track and field. Currently the competition consists of more than 25 sports.

In 1942 as a result of university reform, the campus was organized with a considerable degree of autonomy into the Colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, and Science under the direction of a vice-chancellor. In the 1950s the institution saw more programs added when the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Nuclear Center were established.

The Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly reorganized the University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s system in 1966. This reorganization of the system led to the controversial change of its name to University of Puerto Rico ‚Äì Mayag√ºez Campus, which is used to the present day as the official name of the institution.

In 2007, 35.4% of all Engineering degrees were granted to women at UPRM, one of the largest percentages in US universities. The University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez is the second largest Hispanic-serving institution in the United States.

In 2010 the campus went on strike as part of the 2010‚Äì2011 University of Puerto Rico strikes. In 2017 in response to budget cuts to the university system by the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico the campus students voted to join the University of Puerto Rico strikes, 2017.

==Organization==
UPRM consists of the Colleges of Agricultural Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Engineering, and the Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies. The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the Agricultural Experiment Station.

===Administrative board===
The Administrative board of the Mayag√ºez Campus consists of the chancellor as presiding officer, the deans, two academic senators elected among those faculty members of the senate who are not &quot;ex officio&quot;, senators, and an elected student representative. The president of the university serves as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member. The board acts as an advisory body to the chancellor, prepares the development plan of the campus, approves the proposed budget prepared by the chancellor, and grants tenure, promotions and leaves of absence.


¬ß Interim chancellor later made permanent

===Academic Senate===
The Academic Senate at UPRM is composed of the members of the administrative board, the director of the library, the director of the counseling office, representatives elected from the faculties whose total must not be less than twice the number of the elected &quot;ex officio&quot; members, an elected member of the Library and Counseling Office, and ten student representatives. The academic senate is the official forum of the academic community. Its main task is to participate in the formulation of academic processes within the university&#x27;s legal structure.
==Campus==
The UPR-Mayag√ºez campus encompasses approximately 315¬†acres (1.27¬†km2). The campus has a sports complex that includes a gym, a weight room, rooms for dance/aerobic classes, courts for basketball, a tennis and volleyball complex, a natatorium, an outdoor sports field and the Rafael A.

==Academics==
The University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez consists of four major colleges:
* College of Agricultural Sciences
* College of Arts and Sciences
* College of Business Administration
* College of Engineering

UPRM offers 55 bachelor&#x27;s programs, 44 master&#x27;s programs, and 9 doctoral programs. The 5 most popular undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s in the university are Mechanical Engineering, Biology, Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering.

UPRM offers undergraduate and graduate education in all of their four colleges, while doctoral programs are only offered in the College of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Engineering.

The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the Agricultural Experiment Station and the Agricultural Extension Service.

UPRM College of Engineering graduation rates are higher than the University of Wisconsin, Texas A&amp;M University, University of Washington and the University of Minnesota. It has increased the percentage of its faculty with doctorates from 66.5% in the 1999‚Äì2000 academic year to 79.4% in 2007. As of spring 2023, the campus had 634 instructional faculty (585 full-time and 49 part-time), which includes those who are tenured, on tenure-track, and not on tenure-track. In terms of student enrollment, a total of 10,071 students were enrolled (9,251 undergraduates and 820 graduates).

The Mayag√ºez campus is one of two land-grant universities in the tropics and the only one where Spanish is the native language (although English is also used extensively). The academic calendar has two semesters: fall (early August to mid-December) and spring (early January to mid-May). While textbooks and research materials used at the University of Puerto Rico are often in English, Spanish is the language of instruction in most courses at UPRM, and students are required to have a working knowledge of the English language. The individual professor decides the language used in class lectures and in student evaluation activities.

===Research===
UPRM is one of the important centers in the Atlantic region for the study of tropical marine science due to its location, facilities, and researchers. The research facilities includes the Puerto Rico Water Resources and Environmental Research Institute, the Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI), the Research and Development Center, the Agricultural Research Station and the Caribbean Atmospheric Research Center (ATMOSCarib).

The College of Engineering offers computerized laboratories for teaching, measuring fatigue and fractures in different materials, designing manufactured products and the processes to build them, and computer design. There is a Center for Civil Infrastructure used to design structures resistant to natural disasters and transportation systems. Other research areas include development of solar powered vehicles and boats, use of satellite photography to study earth phenomena, and study of the environmental impact of industrial toxins.

The Departments of English, Humanities, and Hispanic Studies also produce first-rate scholarship. Some of the most important fields include digital humanities, Caribbean cultural studies, and transnational topics.

In addition to the numerous research laboratories under direct faculty supervision, the Mayag√ºez campus has several research and development institutes that provide valuable support for research activities. Arts and Sciences is the college with the largest portfolio of funded research at the university and the highest number of patents, mostly from the Physics Department. Most of the science education funded efforts are in the following areas: science and mathematics education, detection of explosives, environmental sciences, biotechnology, ecosystems and conservation, oceanic processes, nanotechnology and advanced materials, human behavior and energy.

Its researchers, faculty, graduate and undergraduate students are at the forefront of areas such as tsunamis, nanotechnology, protein, oceanic processes, bio‚Äêmarkers, coral reefs, applied economics, disasters, monitoring of seismic activity, biodiversity and physical oceanography.

The research facilities includes a campus-wide wireless network available to the whole university community (over 80 access points), Internet 2 Institution with an OC3 access line, video conference facilities, online course development platform, 42 academic computer labs for students (1,032 computers estimated), about 5,000 computers estimated including administrative, faculty and research facilities and a campus network backbone infrastructure interconnecting over 40 buildings fiber optics.

The Puerto Rico Seismic Network, in charge of monitoring seismic activity for the Caribbean region, is on the campus.

====College of Engineering====
The college is accredited by ABET. It is among the top 10 U.S. universities in the field of engineering in number of students enrolled.

The University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez produces around 600 engineers every year. A National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering, Inc. (NACME) report for the 1996‚Äì1997 academic year indicates the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez graduated by far the largest number of Hispanic engineers.

<doc id="453999" wikidata="Q568104" url="?curid=453999" title="Another Side of Bob Dylan">
<text>Another Side of Bob Dylan is the fourth studio album by the American singer and songwriter Bob Dylan, released on August 8, 1964, by Columbia Records.

The album deviates from the more socially conscious style which Dylan had developed with his previous LP, &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;&quot; (1964). The change prompted criticism from some influential figures in the folk community¬†‚Äì &quot;Sing Out!&quot; editor Irwin Silber complained that Dylan had &quot;somehow lost touch with people&quot; and was caught up in &quot;the paraphernalia of fame&quot;.

Despite the album&#x27;s thematic shift, Dylan performed the entirety of &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; as he had previous records¬†‚Äì solo. In addition to his usual acoustic guitar and harmonica, Dylan provides piano on one track, &quot;Black Crow Blues&quot;. &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; reached No. 43 in the United States (although it eventually went gold), and peaked at No. 8 on the UK charts in 1965.

A high-definition 5.1 surround sound edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.

== Writing ==
Throughout 1963, Dylan worked on a novel and a play. A number of publishers were interested in signing Dylan to a contract, and at one point, City Lights (a small but prestigious company specializing in poetry) was strongly considered. However, as Dylan worked on his book at a casual pace, his manager, Albert Grossman, decided to make a deal with a major publisher.

Macmillan&#x27;s senior editor, Bob Markel, said, &quot;We gave [Dylan] an advance for an untitled book of writings... The publisher was taking a risk on a young, untested potential phenomenon.&quot; When Markel met with Dylan for the first time, &quot;there was no book at the time... The material at that point was hazy, sketchy. The poetry editor called it &#x27;inaccessible.&#x27; The symbolism was not easily understood, but on the other hand it was earthy, filled with obscure but marvelous imagery... I felt it had a lot of value and was very different from Dylan&#x27;s output till then. [But] it was not a book.&quot;

It would be years before Dylan finished his book, but the free form poetry experiments that came from it eventually influenced his songwriting. The most notable example came in a six-line coda to a poem responding to President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination (which took place on November 22, 1963):

the colors of Friday were dull / as cathedral bells were gently burnin / strikin for the gentle / strikin for the kind / strikin for the crippled ones / an strikin for the blind

This refrain would soon appear in a very important composition, &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, and, as biographer Clinton Heylin writes, &quot;with this sad refrain, Dylan would pass from topical troubadour to poet of the road.&quot;

In February 1964, Dylan embarked on a 20-day trip across the United States. Riding in a station wagon with a few friends (Paul Clayton, Victor Maymudes, and Pete Karman), Dylan began the trip in New York, taking numerous detours through many states before ending the trip in California. (At one point, Dylan reportedly paid a visit to poet Carl Sandburg.) &quot;We talked to people in bars, miners,&quot; Dylan would later say. &quot;Talking to people¬†‚Äì that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at, man.&quot;

According to Heylin, &quot;the primary motivation for this trip was to find enough inspiration to step beyond the folk-song form, if not in the bars, or from the miners, then by peering deep into himself.&quot; Dylan spent much time in the back of the station wagon, working on songs and possibly poetry on a typewriter. It was during this trip that Dylan composed &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, finishing it in time to premiere at a Denver concert on the 15th. &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was also composed during this trip.

It was also during this trip that the Beatles arrived in America. Their first visit to the United States remains a touchstone in American culture. Maymudes recalled how Dylan &quot;nearly jumped out the car&quot; when &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; came on the radio and his comments: &quot;Did you hear that?..that was fuckin&#x27; great! Oh man..&quot; and how Dylan seemed lost in thought replaying the record over in his head. Dylan, however, had already been following the Beatles since 1963. There have been different accounts regarding Dylan&#x27;s attitude towards the Beatles at this time, but it&#x27;s known that Suze Rotolo and Al Aronowitz immediately took to them and championed their music to Dylan. Aronowitz later claimed that Dylan dismissed them as &quot;bubblegum&quot;, but in an interview in 1971, Dylan recalls being impressed by their music. &quot;We were driving through Colorado, we had the radio on, and eight of the Top 10 songs were Beatles songs... &#x27;I Wanna Hold Your Hand,&#x27; all those early ones. They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid... I knew they were pointing the direction of where music had to go.&quot;

In January1964, while the Beatles were in France, George Harrison bought the French release of &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; (1963), titled &quot;En Roue Libre&quot;, which they played repeatedly, impressed by the lyrics and &quot;just the attitude!&quot; As the Beatles began to influence Dylan and vice versa, Dylan&#x27;s personal life was undergoing a number of significant changes. When Dylan returned to New York in March, he rented an electric guitar. He continued his romance with folksinger Joan Baez, though their stage appearances together began to dwindle. Dylan&#x27;s girlfriend Suze Rotolo apparently had had enough of the affair. Soon after Dylan returned to New York, the two had an argument. At the time, Suze was staying with her sister Carla, and when Carla intervened, Dylan began screaming at Carla. Carla ordered Dylan to leave, but he refused to go. Carla Rotolo pushed Dylan, and he pushed her back. The two of them were soon practically fighting. Friends were called and Dylan had to be forcibly removed, effectively ending his relationship with Suze Rotolo. In a 1966 interview, Dylan admitted that after their relationship ended, &quot;I got very, very strung out for a while. I mean, really, very strung out.&quot;

One account of Dylan&#x27;s first experience with psychedelics places it in April 1964; producer Paul Rothchild told Bob Spitz that he was present when Dylan took his first hit of LSD. By February 1964, Dylan was already telling his friends that &quot;Rimbaud&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at. That&#x27;s the kind of stuff means something. That&#x27;s the kind of writing I&#x27;m gonna do.&quot; A nineteenth-century French poet, Rimbaud once wrote to his mentor Georges Izambard in May 1871 that &quot;the poet makes himself a seer by a long, prodigious and rational disordering of the senses ... He reaches [for] the unknown and even if, crazed, he ends up by losing the understanding of his visions, at least he has seen them.&quot; 

Dylan later left for Europe, completing a few performances in England before traveling to Paris where he was introduced to a German model, Christa Paffgen, who went by the name of Nico. After treating Dylan to a meal at her flat, Nico accompanied Dylan across Europe, a trip that passed through Germany before ending in Vouliagmeni, a small village outside of Athens, Greece. Dylan stayed at Vouliagmeni for more than a week, finishing many of the songs that would appear on his fourth and upcoming album. Nine songs of these would be recorded upon his return to New York: &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;, &quot;Spanish Harlem Incident&quot;, &quot;To Ramona&quot;, &quot;I Shall Be Free No. 10&quot;, &quot;Ballad in Plain D&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot;, &quot;Mama, You Been on My Mind&quot;, &quot;Denise Denise&quot;, and &quot;Black Crow Blues&quot;. Dylan also completed another song called &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It With Mine&quot;, which, according to Nico, was &quot;about me and my little baby&quot;. Dylan gave the song to Nico, who would eventually record it for her own album, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, released in 1967.

== Recording ==
With Dylan&#x27;s commercial profile on the rise, Columbia was now urging Dylan to release a steady stream of recordings. Upon Dylan&#x27;s return to New York, studio time was quickly scheduled, with Tom Wilson back as producer.

The first (and only) recording session was held June 9 at Columbia&#x27;s Studio A, located at 799 Seventh Avenue in New York City. According to Heylin, &quot;while polishing off a couple of bottles of Beaujolais,&quot; Dylan recorded 14 original compositions, in a single three-hour session between 7pm and 10pm that night, 11 of which were chosen for the final album. The three that were ultimately rejected were &quot;Denise Denise,&quot; &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man,&quot; and &quot;Mama, You Been on My Mind.&quot;

Nat Hentoff&#x27;s article on Dylan for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, published in late October 1964, includes remarkable descriptions of the June 9 session. Hentoff describes in considerable detail the atmosphere in the CBS recording studio and Dylan&#x27;s own asides and banter with his friends in the studio, with the session&#x27;s producers, and Hentoff himself.

Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott was present during part of this session, and Dylan asked him to perform on &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man.&quot; &quot;He invited me to sing on it with him,&quot; recalls Elliott, &quot;but I didn&#x27;t know the words &#x27;cept for the chorus, so I just harmonized with him on the chorus.&quot; Only one complete take was recorded, with Dylan stumbling on some of the lyrics. Though the recording was ultimately rejected, Dylan would return to the song for his next album.

By the time Dylan recorded what was ultimately the master take of &quot;My Back Pages&quot;, it was 1:30 in the morning. Master takes were selected, and after some minor editing, a final album was soon sequenced.

== Songs and themes ==
As Dylan told Nat Hentoff in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;there aren&#x27;t any finger-pointin&#x27; songs&quot; on &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;, which was a significant step in a new direction. Music critic Tim Riley writes, &quot;As a set, the songs constitute a decisive act of noncommitment to issue-bound protest, to tradition-bound folk music and the possessive bonds of its audience [...] The love songs open up into indeterminate statements about the emotional orbits lovers take, and the topical themes pass over artificial moral boundaries and leap into wide-ranging social observation.&quot;

&quot;The compassion that laces all the complaints in &#x27;All I Really Want to Do&#x27; and &#x27;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&#x27; is round with idealism and humor,&quot; writes Riley. &quot;That [both songs] work off a pure Jimmie Rodgers yodel only makes their ties to wide-open American optimism that much more enticing (even though they are both essentially reluctant good-byes).&quot;

&quot;Black Crow Blues&quot; is a traditional twelve-bar blues arrangement with original lyrics.

&quot;&#x27;Spanish Harlem Incident&#x27; is a new romance that pretends to be short and sweet,&quot; writes Riley, &quot;but it&#x27;s an example of how Dylan begins using uncommon word couplings to evoke the mysteries of intimacy [...] her &#x27;rattling drums&#x27; play off his &#x27;restless palms&#x27;; her &#x27;pearly eyes&#x27; and &#x27;flashing diamond teeth&#x27; off his &#x27;pale face.&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; can be traced to &quot;Lay Down Your Weary Tune&quot;, an outtake from &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;&quot; (1964). &quot;Its sense of the power of nature [...] closely mirrors &#x27;Lay Down Your Weary Tune,&#x27;&quot; writes Clinton Heylin. &quot;Unashamedly apocalyptic [...] the composition of &#x27;Chimes of Freedom&#x27; represented a leap in form that permitted even more intensely poetic songs to burst forth.&quot;

Along with the later track &quot;Motorpsycho Nitemare&quot;, the lyrics on &quot;I Shall Be Free No. 10&quot; have been referred to as &quot;surrealistic talking blues&quot;.

Described by Heylin as &quot;the most realized song on &quot;Another Side&quot;&quot;, &quot;To Ramona&quot; is one of the most celebrated songs on the album. A soft, tender waltz, Riley writes that the song &quot;extends the romance from ideals of emotional honesty out into issues of conditioned conformity (&#x27;From fixtures and forces and friends / That you gotta be just like them&#x27;) [...] in &#x27;Spanish Harlem Incident,&#x27; [Dylan&#x27;s] using flattery as a front for the singer&#x27;s own weak self-image; in &#x27;To Ramona,&#x27; he&#x27;s trying to save his lover from herself if only because he knows he may soon need the same comfort he&#x27;s giving her.&quot;

&quot;Motorpsycho Nitemare&quot;, based in part on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s film &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), satirizes both the rise of the American &#x27;60s counter-culture as well as the mainstream&#x27;s paranoid reactions to it.

Riley describes &quot;My Back Pages&quot; as &quot;a thorough X-ray of Dylan&#x27;s former social proselytizing [...] Dylan renounces his former over-serious messianic perch, and disowns false insights. [...] &#x27;I was so much older then / I&#x27;m younger than that now.&quot;

Described by Riley as &quot;the unalloyed sting of a romantic perfidy&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)&quot; would be dramatically rearranged for a full-electric rock band during Dylan&#x27;s famous 1966 tour with The Hawks.

According to Heylin, &quot;Ballad in Plain D&quot; takes its melody and refrain (&quot;my friends say unto me...&quot;) from the Scottish folk song, &quot;I Once Loved a Lass (The False Bride)&quot;. &quot;The song graphically details the night of his breakup with Suze,&quot; writes Heylin. &quot;Dylan&#x27;s portrayal of Carla as the &#x27;parasite sister&#x27; remains a cruel and inaccurate portrait of a woman who had started out as one of [Dylan&#x27;s] biggest fans, and changed only as she came to see the degrees of emotional blackmail he subjected her younger sister to.&quot; Asked in 1985 if there were any songs he regretted writing, Dylan singled out &quot;Ballad in Plain D&quot;, saying &quot;I look back at that particular one and say... maybe I could have left that alone.&quot;

&quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot; also reworks the same &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; arrangement that was written into Dylan&#x27;s earlier compositions, &quot;Girl from the North Country&quot; and &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot;. Johnny Cash would record his own hit version of this song soon after &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; was released, while The Turtles&#x27; version would chart even higher.

Four songs from &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; were eventually recorded by The Byrds: &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, &quot;My Back Pages&quot;, &quot;Spanish Harlem Incident&quot;, and &quot;All I Really Want to Do&quot;. In addition, they were introduced to their breakthrough hit single &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; through a copy of Dylan&#x27;s unreleased recording from the June 9, 1964 album session. All received their share of critical acclaim.

== Reception ==
As &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; was prepared for release, Dylan premiered his new songs at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1964. The festival also marked Dylan&#x27;s first meeting with Johnny Cash; Dylan was already an admirer of Cash&#x27;s music, and vice versa. The two spent a night jamming together in Joan Baez&#x27;s room at the Viking Motor Inn. According to Cash, &quot;we were so happy to [finally] meet each other that we were jumping on the beds like kids.&quot; The next day, Cash performed Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot; as part of his set, telling the audience that &quot;we&#x27;ve been doing it on our shows all over the country, trying to tell the folks about Bob, that we think he&#x27;s the best songwriter of the age since Pete Seeger... Sure do.&quot;

Though the audience at Newport seemed to enjoy Dylan&#x27;s new material, the folk press did not. Irwin Silber of &quot;Sing Out!&quot; and David Horowitz criticized Dylan&#x27;s direction and accused Dylan of succumbing to the pressures/temptations of fame. In an open letter to Dylan published in the November issue of &quot;Sing Out!&quot;, Silber wrote &quot;your new songs seem to be all inner-directed now, inner-probing, self-conscious&quot; and, based on what he saw at Newport, &quot;that some of the paraphernalia of fame [was] getting in your way.&quot; Horowitz called the songs an &quot;unqualified failure of taste and self-critical awareness.&quot;

The album was a step back commercially, failing to make the Top 40, indicating that record consumers may have had a problem as well.

Dylan soon defended his work, writing to columnist Ralph J. Gleason that &quot;the songs are insanely honest, not meanin t twist any heads an written only for the reason that i myself me alone wanted and needed t write them.&quot;

== Legacy ==

Years later, mixed reactions over &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; remained but not for the same reasons. Critics later viewed it as a &#x27;transitional&#x27; album. Clinton Heylin claimed that &quot;Dylan was simply too close to the experiences he was drawing upon to translate them into art. He was also still experimenting with the imagery found on &#x27;Chimes of Freedom&#x27; and &#x27;Mr. Tambourine Man.&#x27; &#x27;My Back Pages,&#x27; the least successful example of the new style, was replete with bizarre compound images (&#x27;corpse evangelists,&#x27; &#x27;confusion boats,&#x27; etc.).&quot; &quot;Salon.com&quot; critic Bill Wyman dismissed it as &quot;a lesser, &#x27;relationship&#x27; album&quot;, but conceded that &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot; was a &quot;lovely hymn to the &#x27;countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an&#x27; worse&#x27;.&quot;

However, Tim Riley called it &quot;a bridge between folkie rhetoric (albeit superior) and his troika of electric rants... a rock album without electric guitars, a folk archetype that punches through the hardy, plainspoken mold. Built on repeated riffs and coaxed by the controlled anxiety of Dylan&#x27;s voice, the songs work off one another with intellectually charged √©lan. It&#x27;s a transition album with a mind of its own.&quot; It was voted number 133 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000).

== Outtakes ==
A complete take of &quot;Mama, You Been on My Mind&quot; was recorded for the album, but for reasons unknown, it was rejected. Described by Tim Riley as &quot;the echo of a left-behind affair that rebounds off a couple of self-aware curves (&#x27;I am not askin&#x27; you to say words like &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no,&#x27; /... I&#x27;m just breathin&#x27; to myself, pretendin&#x27; not that I don&#x27;t know),&quot; the song was soon covered by Joan Baez, as well as Judy Collins, who had a considerable amount of commercial success with it. Dylan&#x27;s version would not see release until &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1‚Äì3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961‚Äì1991&quot; in 1991. However, Dylan would periodically perform the song in concert, occasionally with Baez as his duet partner. Rod Stewart would later cover the song for his critically acclaimed album, &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; (1972), and a version by Jeff Buckley appears as an out-take on the 2004 reissue of &quot;Grace&quot; (1994). Johnny Cash covered the song on his album &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; (1965). It was covered by Linda Ronstadt on her 1969 album &quot;Hand Sown ... Home Grown&quot; with altered lyrics as &quot;Baby, You&#x27;ve Been on My Mind&quot;.

Though &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; would be re-recorded for Dylan&#x27;s next album, Sony released the complete take recorded for &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot; in 2005. Unlike the familiar version recorded for &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; (1965), this early version has a harmonica intro as well as Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott singing harmony vocals on the chorus. It was an acetate copy of this version of the song that found its way to the newly formed Byrds in late 1964, leading to their breakthrough electrified recording of the song.

Dylan also recorded two additional songs that did not make the album. The first is &quot;Denise Denise&quot;, a song which uses the same music as &quot;Black Crow Blues&quot; but with different lyrics. The second is &quot;California&quot;, which again uses &quot;Black Crow Blues music as the basic structure of the song. A small section of the &quot;California&quot; lyrics were reused in &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot;, a song that appeared on Dylan&#x27;s next album, &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;. Both outtakes are circulating.

<doc id="454007" wikidata="Q1025099" url="?curid=454007" title="Shell game">
<text>The shell game (also known as thimblerig, three shells and a pea, the old army game) is a public gambling game that challenges players to follow the movement of a marker hidden under one of several covers (shells). In practice, the game is almost always run as a confidence trick that uses sleight of hand to transfer the marker between covers. In confidence trick slang, this swindle is referred to as a &quot;short-con&quot; because it is quick and easy to pull off. The shell game is related to the cups and balls conjuring trick, which is performed purely for entertainment purposes without any purported gambling element.

==Play==

In the shell game, three or more identical containers (which may be cups, shells, bottle caps, or anything else) are placed face-down on a surface. A small ball is placed beneath one of these containers so that it cannot be seen, and they are then shuffled by the operator in plain view. One or more players are invited to bet on which container holds the ball ‚Äì typically, the operator offers to double the player&#x27;s stake if they guess right. Where the game is played honestly, the operator can win if he shuffles the containers in a way which the player cannot follow.

In practice, however, the shell game is notorious for its use by confidence tricksters who will typically rig the game using sleight of hand to move or hide the ball during play and replace it as required. Fraudulent shell games are also known for the use of psychological tricks to convince potential players of the legitimacy of the game ‚Äì for example, by using shills or by allowing a player to win a few times before beginning the scam.

==History==

The shell game dates back at least to Ancient Greece. It can be seen in several paintings of the European Middle Ages. Later, walnut shells were used, and today the use of bottle caps or matchboxes is common. The game has also been called &quot;thimblerig&quot; as it could be played using sewing thimbles. The first recorded use of the term &quot;thimblerig&quot; is in 1826.

The swindle became very popular throughout the nineteenth century, and games were often set up in or around traveling fairs. A thimblerig team (comprising operator and confederates) was depicted in William Powell Frith&#x27;s 1858 painting, &quot;The Derby Day&quot;. In Frith&#x27;s 1888 &quot;My Autobiography and Reminiscences&quot;, the painter-turned-memoirist leaves an account of his encounter with a thimble-rig team (operator and accomplices):

Fear of jail and the need to find new &quot;flats&quot; (victims) kept these &quot;sharps&quot; (shell men or &quot;operators&quot;) traveling from one town to the next, never staying in one place very long. One of the most infamous confidence men of the nineteenth century, Jefferson Randolph Smith, known as Soapy Smith, led organized gangs of shell men throughout the mid-western United States, and later in Alaska.

Today, the game is still being played for money in many major cities around the world, usually at locations with a high tourist concentration (for example: La Rambla in Barcelona, Gran Via in Madrid, Westminster Bridge in London, Kurf√ºrstendamm in Berlin, Bahnhofsviertel in Frankfurt am Main and public spaces in Paris, Buenos Aires, Benidorm, New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles). The swindle is classified as a confidence trick game, and illegal to play for money in most countries.

The game also inspired a pricing game on the game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, in which contestants attempt to win a larger prize by pricing smaller prizes to earn attempts at finding a ball hidden under one of four shells designed to resemble walnut shells. While the ball is not shown during the game, and the host shuffles the shells before the start of the game, contestants can win by either winning all four attempts or winning enough attempts (via big &quot;chips&quot; to mark the shells), and picking the one that has the ball. The shuffling is only allowed before the pricing part of the game begins, and once the first small prize is announced, no further shuffling is permitted. Federal game show regulations are designed to ensure the game is legally a game that can be won.

<text>William M. Ireland (died December 24, 1891) was one of the eight founders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, a fraternal organization in the United States.

==Biography==
Ireland was born in Pennsylvania but lived most of his life in Washington, D.C., as chief clerk in the offices of the U.S. Post Office Department. When the National Order of the Grange of Patrons of Husbandry was founded in 1866, Ireland served as the first treasurer until 1870. He was an avid Freemason, Ireland added valuable knowledge to organizational systems and methods in the formative period of the Grange movement. His ability to be a critic and adviser in setting up the work of the Grange created a balance of knowledge and inspiration. His accounting abilities also aided in the system of financial policy within the Grange. He died on December 24, 1891, and was buried in Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia.

The other founders of the Grange were Oliver Hudson Kelley, William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, John R. Thompson and Caroline A. Hall.

The first subordinate grange was founded in Washington, D.C., on January 8, 1868, and Ireland served as the schoolmaster.

Ireland was responsible for the publication of The Journals of Proceedings for the organization and compiled ten annual sessions from 1875 to 1883.

At the twelfth session of the Grange, Ireland was elected to fill the remaining term as secretary and was re-elected three times afterward.

<doc id="454013" wikidata="Q3725090" url="?curid=454013" title="End Is Forever">
<text>End Is Forever is the third studio album by American rock band The Ataris, released on Kung-Fu Records in 2001. The album features a mix of punk and pop punk similar to the band&#x27;s previous works along with catchy pop rhythms. It contains lyrics that span nostalgia, growing up, love, relationships, and singer Kris Roe&#x27;s childhood. End is Forever is notable for its many pop culture references and numerous lyrics that Roe describes as having &quot;hidden meanings&quot; encoded within.

==Background and production==
In April 1999, the Ataris released their second studio album &quot;Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits&quot;. They promoted the album with tours alongside Blink-182, Home Grown, and MxPx. In April 2000, the band released a split album with Useless ID. Between June 15 and July 20, 2000, the band recorded &quot;End Is Forever&quot; at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with producers Joey Cape and Jason Livermore. Additional recording was held at Orange Whip and The Crank Lab, both in Santa Barbara, California with additional production from Angus Cooke.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;End Is Forever&quot; has been described as pop punk, with themes revolving around Roe&#x27;s relationships, and being lonely while on tour. Roe considered it &quot;a little bit more dynamic&quot; than their previous album, with &quot;a little bit more intricate&quot; song structures, incorporating the use of cello and piano. The opening track &quot;Giving Up on Love&quot; channels the style of the Foo Fighters. &quot;Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start&quot; talks about staying young; its title is a reference to a cheat code from the video game &quot;Contra&quot; (1987). &quot;Song for a Mix Tape&quot; incorporates country blues guitar licks within its pop-punk chord progression. &quot;How I Spent My Summer Vacation&quot; was originally included on the split with Useless ID; it was re-recorded for inclusion on &quot;End Is Forever&quot;. &quot;Teenage Riot&quot; features references to &quot;Longview&quot; (1994) by Green Day, and &quot;West End Riot&quot; (1999) by the Living End. &quot;Song #13&quot; is about turning the other cheek when someone says disparaging comments about another person. The album closes with the acoustic song &quot;Hello and Goodbye&quot;.

==Release==
The Ataris appeared on the second leg of the Fat Wreck tour, and performed on the east coast dates of the Warped Tour. In October 2000, the band supported the Vandals on their tour of the UK. On October 8, &quot;Song #13&quot; was made available for free download through the band&#x27;s MP3.com profile. After initially being planned for released in October 2000, &quot;End Is Forever&quot; was eventually released on February 20, 2001, through Kung Fu Records. The Ataris held a release show for it at the band&#x27;s own store Down on Haley; the music video for &quot;Teenage Riot&quot; was filmed at the show. The band toured Australia and then went to the UK. After returning to the US, they went on a tour with Lagwagon, and the Vandals. In April, the band played in Japan, before going to New Zealand, Australia and the UK; One Dollar Short appeared on the Australian dates.

After returning to the US in May, the band supported Blink-182 for a few shows. On June 18, the music video for &quot;Summer Wind Was Always Our Song&quot; was filmed at Down on Haley. At the end of the month, guitarist Marco Pe√±a left the band amid to creative and personal differences; he was replaced by guitar tech John Collura, formerly of the band Beefcake. Following this, the band performed on the Warped Tour until August. Later in the month, the band played three shows in the UK as part of the Extreme 2001 festival. On August 27, the &quot;Summer Wind Was Always Our Song&quot; music video was posted on Kung Fu Records&#x27; website. Following the stint, the band played a few European festivals, before embarking on another US tour. In November and December, the band went on a west coast tour with All, before taking a break until early 2002.

==Reception==

The staff of &quot;Chart Attack&quot; wrote that &quot;End Is Forever&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t stray far from previous Ataris releases ... wrap[ing] melodies in chunky guitar riffs, working solid song arrangements with tight stop-start coordination.&quot; &quot;Modern Fix&quot; writer Michael Moriatis said the record was &quot;more mature and definitely more produced, almost to a fault, than previous Ataris‚Äô albums.&quot; Randy Flame of &quot;Ox-Fanzine&quot; found the album &quot;[p]erfect both in the songwriting and in the production&quot;. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; Rob Ferraz said the band &quot;serve up a tasty buffet of melancholy pop punk&quot; with &quot;End Is Forever&quot;. He added, &quot;[i]f you enjoy songs about heartbreak, falling in love and making mixed tapes for that special someone, then this is the record for you.&quot; Brian Kruger for &quot;Ink19&quot; said the &quot;playing, singing, and production are perfect. Too perfect, in fact. That‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt like about The Ataris ‚Äî they‚Äôre too bright and shiny&quot;.

AllMusic reviewer Vincent Jeffries wrote that the band &quot;offered up the dynamic, dangerously non-punk End Is Forever.&quot; He noted that listeners that knew the band&#x27;s earlier works wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;surprised by End Is Forever as Roe&#x27;s quickly developing, gifted writing had always been the outfit&#x27;s defining factor&quot;. Hocking of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; noted the lyrical themes of &quot;girls, love, broken hearts, teen frustrations and er, girls&quot;, before asking, &quot;[w]hich isn&#x27;t really anything new is it?&quot; He said that &quot;[c]ompared to previous albums this is pretty average and a lot tamer&quot;. In a retrospective review, Sputnikmusic staff member Atari said the record was &quot;their most consistent album to date.&quot; He added, &quot;[i]t&#x27;s an underappreciated and often overlooked album&quot;. &quot;Punk Planet&quot; reviewer Kyle Ryan said track three alone was &quot;enough for me to give the Ataris a gold star of cleverness&quot;. Though, apart from this, the band managed to &quot;pull [the pop punk sound] off occasionally, but they don&#x27;t make it work the whole time&quot;.

It reached No. 14 on the Billboard Independent Albums chart and No. 24 on the Top Heatseekers chart.

<text>Caroline Arabella Hall (1838 ‚Äì December 11, 1918) was one of the eight founders of the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, an American agricultural fraternal organization better known as The Grange or Grange Hall.

==Biography==
Hall was born in Boston in 1838 to Hepzibah and Nathanial Hall.

She played a key role in assuring that women would be on an equal footing with men from the first inception of the Grange movement, feeling that because the family farm included women, then so should the organization that the family would join. Aware through her rural teaching that farm women were usually isolated on the farm, she saw that the Grange would offer an important opportunity for women to expand their talents. She became Oliver Hudson Kelley&#x27;s assistant (she was also his niece). It was through her attention to detail and correspondence that Kelley&#x27;s dream became a reality in organizing the Grange. The National Grange later dignified her vital contributions to the formation of the Order by recognizing her as co-equal with the other seven founders, stating:

The city of Carrabelle, Florida, which was founded by her uncle in the late 1870s, was named after her. Hall also served as the town&#x27;s first postmaster.

Hall lived with her brother, Albert R. Hall for many years on a farm near Knapp, Wisconsin, and inherited it on his death in 1905. Failing health caused her to move to an apartment in Minneapolis. On October 11, 1918, she was involved in an automobile accident near French Lick, Indiana, from which she never recovered, and she died at the age of 80 on December 11, 1918.

Hall was interred at Lake Wood Cemetery in Minneapolis. A friend said of her, &quot;She just lived being sweet and lovely to everyone.&quot;

The eight founders of the Grange were Oliver Hudson Kelley, William Saunders, Francis M. McDowell, John Trimble, Aaron B. Grosh, John R. Thompson, William M. Ireland, and‚Äîrecognized later than the other seven‚ÄîHall.

<doc id="454015" wikidata="Q1458559" url="?curid=454015" title="Linguistic homeland">
<text>In historical linguistics, the homeland or  ( , from German &#x27;original&#x27; and &#x27;home&#x27;) of a proto-language is the region in which it was spoken before splitting into different daughter languages. A proto-language is the reconstructed or historically-attested parent language of a group of languages that are genetically related.

Depending on the age of the language family under consideration, its homeland may be known with near-certainty (in the case of historical or near-historical migrations) or it may be very uncertain (in the case of deep prehistory). Next to internal linguistic evidence, the reconstruction of a prehistoric homeland makes use of a variety of disciplines, including archaeology and archaeogenetics.

==Methods==
There are several methods to determine the homeland of a given language family. One method is based on the vocabulary that can be reconstructed for the proto-language. This vocabulary ‚Äì especially terms for flora and fauna ‚Äì can provide clues for the geographical and ecological environment in which the proto-language was spoken. An estimate for the time-depth of the proto-language is necessary in order to account for prehistorical changes in climate and the distribution of flora and fauna.

Another method is based on the &quot;linguistic migration theory&quot; (first proposed by Edward Sapir), which states that the most likely candidate for the last homeland of a language family can be located in the area of its highest linguistic diversity. This presupposes an established view about the internal subgrouping of the language family. Different assumptions about high-order subgrouping can thus lead to very divergent proposals for a linguistic homeland (e.g. Isidore Dyen&#x27;s proposal for New Guinea as the center of dispersal of the Austronesian languages). The linguistic migration theory has its limits because it only works when linguistic diversity evolves continuously without major disruptions. Its results can be distorted e.g. when this diversity is wiped out by more recent migrations.

== Limitations of the concept ==

The concept of a (single, identifiable) &quot;homeland&quot; of a given language family implies a purely genealogical view of the development of languages. This assumption is often reasonable and useful, but it is by no means a logical necessity, as languages are well known to be susceptible to areal change such as substrate or superstrate influence.

=== Time depth ===

Over a sufficient period of time, in the absence of evidence of intermediary steps in the process, it may be impossible to observe linkages between languages that have a shared Urheimat: given enough time, natural language change will obliterate any meaningful linguistic evidence of a common genetic source.
This general concern is a manifestation of the larger issue of &quot;time depth&quot; in historical linguistics.

For example, the languages of the New World are believed to be descended from a relatively &quot;rapid&quot; peopling of the Americas (relative to the duration of the Upper Paleolithic) within a few millennia (roughly between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago), but their genetic relationship has become completely obscured over the more than ten millennia which have passed between their separation and their first written record in the early modern period. Similarly, the Australian Aboriginal languages are divided into some 28 families and isolates for which no genetic relationship can be shown.

The &quot;Urheimaten&quot; reconstructed using the methods of comparative linguistics typically estimate separation times dating to the Neolithic or later. It is undisputed that fully developed languages were present throughout the Upper Paleolithic, and possibly into the deep Middle Paleolithic (see origin of language, behavioral modernity). These languages would have spread with the early human migrations of the first &quot;peopling of the world&quot;, but they are no longer amenable to linguistic reconstruction. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) has imposed linguistic separation lasting several millennia on many Upper Paleolithic populations in Eurasia, as they were forced to retreat into &quot;refugia&quot; before the advancing ice sheets. After the end of the LGM, Mesolithic populations of the Holocene again became more mobile, and most of the prehistoric spread of the world&#x27;s major linguistic families seem to reflect the expansion of population cores during the Mesolithic followed by the Neolithic Revolution.

The Nostratic theory is the best-known attempt to expand the deep prehistory of the main language families of Eurasia (excepting Sino-Tibetan and the languages of Southeast Asia) to the beginning of the Holocene. First proposed in the early 20th century, the Nostratic theory still receives serious consideration, but it is by no means generally accepted. The more recent and more speculative &quot;Borean&quot; hypothesis attempts to unite Nostratic with Den√©‚ÄìCaucasian and Austric, in a &quot;mega-phylum&quot; that would unite most languages of Eurasia, with a time depth going back to the Last Glacial Maximum.

=== Language contact and creolization ===
The concept of an &quot;Urheimat&quot; only applies to populations speaking a proto-language defined by the tree model. This is not always the case.

For example, in places where language families meet, the relationship between a group that speaks a language and the Urheimat for that language is complicated by &quot;processes of migration, language shift and group absorption are documented by linguists and ethnographers&quot; in groups that are themselves &quot;transient and plastic.&quot; Thus, in the contact area in western Ethiopia between languages belonging to the Nilo-Saharan and Afroasiatic families, the Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nyangatom and the Afroasiatic-speaking Daasanach have been observed to be closely related to each other but genetically distinct from neighboring Afroasiatic-speaking populations. This is a reflection of the fact that the Daasanach, like the Nyangatom, originally spoke a Nilo-Saharan language, with the ancestral Daasanach later adopting an Afroasiatic language around the 19th century.

Creole languages are hybrids of languages that are sometimes unrelated. Similarities arise from the creole formation process, rather than from genetic descent. For example, a creole language may lack significant inflectional morphology, lack tone on monosyllabic words, or lack semantically opaque word formation, even if these features are found in all of the parent languages of the languages from which the creole was formed.

=== Isolates ===
Some languages are language isolates. That is to say, they have no well accepted language family connection, no nodes in a family tree, and therefore no known &quot;Urheimat&quot;. An example is the Basque language of Northern Spain and southwest France. Nevertheless, it is a scientific fact that all languages evolve. An unknown &quot;Urheimat&quot; may still be hypothesized, such as that for a Proto-Basque, and may be supported by archaeological and historical evidence.

Sometimes relatives are found for a language originally believed to be an isolate. An example is the Etruscan language, which, even though only partially understood, is believed to be related to the Rhaetic language and to the Lemnian language. A single family may be an isolate. In the case of the non-Austronesian indigenous languages of Papua New Guinea and the indigenous languages of Australia, there is no published linguistic hypothesis supported by any evidence that these languages have links to any other families. Nevertheless, an unknown Urheimat is implied. The entire Indo-European family itself is a language isolate: no further connections are known. This lack of information does not prevent some professional linguists from formulating additional hypothetical nodes (Nostratic) and additional homelands for the speakers.

==Homelands of major language families==
===Western and central Eurasia===

;Indo-European
:The identification of the Proto-Indo-European homeland has been debated for centuries, but the steppe hypothesis is now widely accepted, placing it in the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe in the late 5th millennium BCE. The leading alternative is the Anatolian hypothesis, proposing a homeland in Anatolia in the early 7th millennium BCE.
;Caucasian
:The unrelated Kartvelian, Northwest Caucasian (Abkhaz-Adygean) and Northeast Caucasian (Nakh-Daghestanian) language families are presumed to be indigenous to the Caucasus. There is extensive evidence for contact between the Caucasian languages, especially Proto-Kartvelian, and Proto-Indo-European, indicating that they were spoken in close proximity at least three to four thousand years ago.
:Although Dravidian languages are now concentrated in southern India, isolated pockets further north, placenames and substrate influences on Indo-Aryan languages indicate that they were once spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinent. Reconstructed Proto-Dravidian terms for flora and fauna support the idea that Dravidian is indigenous to India. Proponents of a migration from the northwest cite the location of Brahui, a hypothesized connection to the undeciphered Indus script, and claims of a link to Elamite.
;Turkic
:Turkic languages are today spoken across an area stretching from northwest China to the edge of Europe, but Proto-Turkic lexical items about the climate, topography, flora, fauna and subsistence point to a homeland in the taiga-steppe zone of southern Siberia and Mongolia around the Altai-Sayan region. Early contact with Mongolic languages also points to this area. Genetic studies suggest that most of the expansion of the language family was due to language replacement rather than migration, but have identified shared elements originating from the South Siberia-Mongolia area.
;Uralic
:Inherited tree names seem to indicate a Uralic homeland to the east of the Ural Mountains. The internal branching of the family suggests an area between the Ob River and Yenisey River. Uralic speakers are not genetically distinguished from their neighbours, but do share a genetic component that is of Siberian origin.

=== Eastern Eurasia ===
;Japonic
:Most scholars believe that Japonic was brought to northern Kyushu from the Korean Peninsula around 700 to 300 BCE by wet-rice farmers of the Yayoi culture, spreading from there throughout the Japanese Archipelago and somewhat later to the Ryukyu Islands. There is fragmentary placename evidence that now-extinct Japonic languages were still spoken in central and southern parts of the Korean peninsula several centuries later.
;Koreanic
:All modern Koreanic varieties are descended from the language of Unified Silla, which ruled the southern two-thirds of the Korean peninsula between the 7th and 10th centuries. Evidence for the earlier linguistic history of the peninsula is extremely sparse. The orthodox view among Korean social historians is that the Korean people migrated to the peninsula from the north, but no archaeological evidence of such a migration has been found.
;Sino-Tibetan
:The reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than for other major families, so its higher-level structure and time depth remain unclear. Proposed homelands and periods include: the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River about 4‚Äì8 kya, associated with the hypothesis of a top-level branching between Chinese and the rest (most likely); southwestern Sichuan around 9 kya, associated with the hypothesis that Chinese and Tibetan form a subbranch; Northeast India (the area of maximal diversity) 9‚Äì10 kya.
;Hmong‚ÄìMien
:The most likely homeland of the Hmong‚ÄìMien languages is in Southern China between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers, but speakers of these languages may have migrated from Central China as a result of the expansion of the Han Chinese.
;Kra‚ÄìDai
:Most scholars locate the homeland of the Kra‚ÄìDai languages in Southern China, possibly coastal Fujian or Guangdong.
;Austroasiatic
:Austroasiatic is widely held to be the oldest family in mainland Southeast Asia, with its current discontinuous distribution resulting from the later arrival of other families. The various branches share a great deal of vocabulary concerning rice cultivation, but few related to metals. Identification of the homeland of the family has been hampered by the lack of progress on its branching. The main proposals are Northern India (favoured by those who assume an early branching of Munda), Southeast Asia (the area of maximal diversity; most likely) and southern China (based on claimed loanwords in Chinese).
;Austronesian
:The homeland of the Austronesian languages is widely accepted by linguists to be Taiwan, since nine of its ten branches are found there, with all Austronesian languages found outside Taiwan belonging to the remaining Malayo-Polynesian branch.

===North America===
;Eskimo‚ÄìAleut
:The Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages originated in the region of the Bering Strait or Southwest Alaska.
;Na-Den√© and Yeniseian
:The Den√©‚ÄìYeniseian hypothesis proposes that the Na-Den√© languages of North America and the Yeniseian languages of Central Siberia share a common ancestor. Suggested homelands for this family include Central or West Asia, Siberia, or Beringia, but there is currently not enough evidence to resolve the question.
;Algic
:The Algic languages are distributed from the Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast of North America. It is suggested that Proto-Algic was spoken on the Columbia Plateau. From there, pre-Wiyot and pre-Yurok speakers moved southwest to the North Coast of California, while the pre-Proto-Algonquian speakers moved to the Great Plains, which was the center of dispersal of the Algonquian languages.
;Uto-Aztecan
:Some authorities on the history of the Uto-Aztecan language family place the Proto-Uto-Aztecan homeland in the border region between the USA and Mexico, namely the upland regions of Arizona and New Mexico and the adjacent areas of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, roughly corresponding to the Sonoran Desert. The proto-language would have been spoken by foragers, about 5,000 years ago. Hill (2001) proposes instead a homeland further south, making the assumed speakers of Proto-Uto-Aztecan maize cultivators in Mesoamerica, who were gradually pushed north, bringing maize cultivation with them, during the period of roughly 4,500 to 3,000 years ago, the geographic diffusion of speakers corresponding to the breakup of linguistic unity.

===South America===
;Tupian
:Proto-Tupian, the reconstructed common ancestor of the Tupian languages of South America, was probably spoken in the region between the Guapor√© and Aripuan√£ rivers, around 5,000 years ago.

===Africa and Middle East===
;Afroasiatic
:As Semitic is the only branch of Afroasiatic found outside Africa, northeast Africa is considered the most likely location of the Afroasiatic homeland. An alternative theory, based on lexical comparisons with Indo-European, proposes a Neolithic expansion from the Middle East. Proto-Afroasiatic is estimated to have begun to break up in the 8th millennium BCE. Proto-Semitic is thought to have been spoken in the Near East between 4400 and 7400 BCE, with Akkadian representing its earliest known branch.
;Niger‚ÄìCongo
:Although the membership and subgrouping of the Niger‚ÄìCongo remains unsettled, the widely-accepted core of the group includes over 1000 languages spoken from West Africa through most of Southern Africa. The homeland is thought to have been somewhere in the savanna belt of West Africa, with the Bantu expansion through the equatorial rainforests of Central Africa beginning around 3000 BCE.
;Mande
:Valentin Vydrin concluded that &quot;the Mande homeland at the second half of the 4th millennium BC was located in Southern Sahara, somewhere to the North of 16¬∞ or even 18¬∞ of Northern latitude and between 3¬∞ and 12¬∞ of Western longitude.&quot; That is now Mauritania and/or southern Western Sahara.
;Nilo-Saharan
:The validity of the Nilo-Saharan family remains controversial. Proponents of the family view the border area between Chad, Sudan, and the Central African Republic as a likely candidate for its homeland from around the start of the Holocene.
;Central-Sudanic
:The original homeland of Central Sudanic speakers is likely somewhere in the Bahr el Ghazal region.
;Khoe-Kwadi
:The homeland of Khoe-Kwadi was likely the middle Zambezi Valley over 2,000 years ago.

===Australia===
;Pama-Nyungan
The Gulf Plains, located in the Northern Territory and Queensland, are the likely origin of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages.

<text>In mathematics, the integral test for convergence is a method used to test infinite series of monotonic terms for convergence. It was developed by Colin Maclaurin and Augustin-Louis Cauchy and is sometimes known as the Maclaurin‚ÄìCauchy test.

==Statement of the test==
Consider an integer and a function defined on the unbounded interval , on which it is monotone decreasing. Then the infinite series

:formula_1

converges to a real number if and only if the improper integral

:formula_2

is finite. In particular, if the integral diverges, then the series diverges as well.

===Remark===
If the improper integral is finite, then the proof also gives the lower and upper bounds

for the infinite series.

Note that if the function formula_3 is increasing, then the function formula_4 is decreasing and the above theorem applies.

Many textbooks require the function formula_5 to be positive, but this condition is not really necessary, since when formula_5 is negative and decreasing both formula_1 and formula_2 diverge.

==Proof==
The proof uses the comparison test, comparing the term formula_9 with the integral of formula_5 over the intervals formula_11 and formula_12 respectively.

The monotonic function formula_5 is continuous almost everywhere. To show this, let 
:formula_14
For every formula_15, there exists by the density of formula_16, a formula_17 so that formula_18. 

Note that this set contains an open non-empty interval precisely if formula_5 is discontinuous at formula_20. We can uniquely identify formula_21 as the rational number that has the least index in an enumeration formula_22 and satisfies the above property. Since formula_5 is monotone, this defines an injective mapping formula_24 and thus formula_25 is countable. It follows that formula_5 is continuous almost everywhere. This is sufficient for Riemann integrability.

Since is a monotone decreasing function, we know that

:formula_27

and

:formula_28

Hence, for every integer ,

and, for every integer ,

By summation over all from to some larger integer , we get from ()

:formula_29

and from ()

:formula_30

Combining these two estimates yields

:formula_31

Letting tend to infinity, the bounds in () and the result follow.

==Applications==
The harmonic series
:formula_32
diverges because, using the natural logarithm, its antiderivative, and the fundamental theorem of calculus, we get
:formula_33
On the other hand, the series
:formula_34
(cf. Riemann zeta function)
converges for every , because by the power rule
:formula_35
From () we get the upper estimate
:formula_36
which can be compared with some of the particular values of Riemann zeta function.

==Borderline between divergence and convergence==
The above examples involving the harmonic series raise the question of whether there are monotone sequences such that decreases to 0 faster than but slower than in the sense that
:formula_37
for every , and whether the corresponding series of the still diverges. Once such a sequence is found, a similar question can be asked with taking the role of , and so on. In this way it is possible to investigate the borderline between divergence and convergence of infinite series.

Using the integral test for convergence, one can show (see below) that, for every natural number , the series

still diverges (cf. proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges for ) but

&lt;/math&gt;|}}
converges for every . Here denotes the -fold composition of the natural logarithm defined recursively by
:formula_38
Furthermore, denotes the smallest natural number such that the -fold composition is well-defined and , i.e.
:formula_39
using tetration or Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation.

To see the divergence of the series () using the integral test, note that by repeated application of the chain rule
:formula_40
hence
:formula_41
To see the convergence of the series (), note that by the power rule, the chain rule and the above result
:formula_42
hence
:formula_43
and () gives bounds for the infinite series in ().

<text>Bradford Claude Dourif (; born March 18, 1950) is an American actor. He is known for voicing Chucky in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; franchise (1988‚Äìpresent), portraying Gr√≠ma Wormtongue in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film series and his Oscar-nominated role as Billy Bibbit in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975).

Brad Dourif&#x27;s other film roles include &quot;Wise Blood&quot; (1979), &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988), &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990), &quot;Critters 4&quot; (1992), &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), and the 2007 remake of &quot;Halloween&quot; and its sequel. He also appeared in many television series, notably &quot;Deadwood&quot; (2004‚Äì2006, ), for which he received Primetime Emmy and Satellite Award nominations for his portrayal of Amos &quot;Doc&quot; Cochran.

== Early life ==
Bradford Claude Dourif was born in Huntington, West Virginia, on March 18, 1950, to Joan Mavis Felton (n√©e Bradford), an actress, and Jean Henri Dourif, an art collector who owned and operated a dye factory.

His paternal grandparents emigrated from France, and his paternal grandfather co-founded the Standard Ultramarine and Color Company in Huntington. After Dourif&#x27;s father died in 1953, his mother married champion golfer William C. Campbell, who helped raise Dourif and his five siblings (four sisters and one brother). From 1963 to 1965, Dourif attended the private Aiken Preparatory School in Aiken, South Carolina. There, he pursued his interests in art and acting. Although he briefly considered becoming a flower arranger, he was eventually inspired to become an actor by his mother&#x27;s participation as an actress in a community theater called Give Me Shelter.

After Aiken, he attended Fountain Valley School in Colorado Springs, Colorado, graduating in 1968. Dourif appeared as an amateur at the Fountain Valley Film Festival in 1969, taking second place in the 8¬†mm film category with his 10-minute entry &quot;Blind Date.&quot; Dourif attended Marshall University for a time, before quitting college and moving to New York City to study acting on the advice of actress Conchata Ferrell.

== Career ==
=== Stage ===
Starting in school productions, Dourif progressed to community theater, joining up with the Huntington Community Players while attending Marshall University. In New York City, he studied with Sanford Meisner, and worked with Marshall Mason and Lanford Wilson at the Circle Repertory Company. During the early 1970s, Dourif appeared in a number of plays, off-Broadway and at Woodstock, New York, including &quot;The Ghost Sonata&quot;, &quot;The Doctor in Spite of Himself&quot;, and &quot;When You Comin&#x27; Back, Red Ryder?&quot;, in which he was spotted by director Milo≈° Forman who cast him in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975).

In 2013, after a three-decade absence from the stage, Dourif chose to star alongside Amanda Plummer in the Off-Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Two-Character Play&quot; that played to critical acclaim at the New World Stages. He explained, in a filmed interview released by the producers, why he broke his 29-year hiatus from acting in live theater: &quot;I hated the stage, did not want to do it. And then somebody said, &#x27;Will you do a play? It&#x27;s with Amanda Plummer&#x27;, and I said, &#x27;Oh shit! No. Oh God, I&#x27;m gonna have to do this...&#x27;&quot;. It opened on June 19, 2013, and closed on September 29, 2013. The play was subject to a number of performance cancellations, one relating to Dourif&#x27;s absence due to a death in the family. Plummer refused to perform without Dourif, notwithstanding the presence of an understudy.

=== Film ===

Dourif had a small role in the film &quot;W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings&quot; (1975), but was omitted from the final cut of the film. His portrayal of the vulnerable Billy Bibbit in &quot;Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; ended up being his big break, earning him a Golden Globe Award (Best Actor Debut) and a British Academy Award (Supporting Actor) as well as a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In 1981, Vincent Canby listed Dourif as one of twelve actors to watch, calling Dourif &quot;one of the most intense, most interesting young film actors of his generation.&quot; Dourif returned to New York, where he continued in theater and taught acting and directing classes at Columbia University until 1988 (Don Mancini was among his students).

He continued with &quot;Eyes of Laura Mars&quot; (1978), John Huston&#x27;s &quot;Wise Blood&quot; (1979), Forman&#x27;s &quot;Ragtime&quot; (1981), Marc Didden&#x27;s &quot;Istanbul&quot; (1985) and David Lynch&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; (1984) and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986).

Dourif has appeared in a number of horror films, most notably as the voice of Chucky in the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; franchise. He portrayed the Gemini Killer in &quot;The Exorcist III&quot; (1990) and appeared in &quot;Death Machine&quot; (1994), &quot;Sworn to Justice&quot; with Cynthia Rothrock and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997). He later appeared as Sheriff Lee Brackett in Rob Zombie&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot; (2007) and &quot;Halloween II&quot; (2009). In 2013, Dourif reprised his role as Chucky in the sixth installment of the &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot; franchise, &quot;Curse of Chucky&quot;, and then again in the 2017 sequel, &quot;Cult of Chucky&quot;. His daughter, Fiona Dourif, also starred with him in both films.

Other notable film roles include Gr√≠ma Wormtongue in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and supporting roles in &quot;Fatal Beauty&quot; (1987), &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; (1988), &quot;Hidden Agenda&quot; (1990), &quot;London Kills Me&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sinner&quot; (2007).

Dourif has worked with director Werner Herzog on many occasions, appearing in &quot;Scream of Stone&quot; (1991), &quot;The Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (2005), &quot;Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans&quot; (2009), and &quot;My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?&quot; (2009).

=== Television ===
In 1984, Dourif played a suspected serial killer in the episode &quot;Number Eight&quot; of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;. In 1994, he appeared in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; as the psychic serial killer Luther Lee Boggs. He also portrayed Lon Suder in a three episode story arc on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and guest starred as a troubled monk haunted by visions in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Dourif later won acclaim as Doc Cochran in &quot;Deadwood&quot;, receiving a 2004 Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series.

In 2011, he guest-starred in the third-season finale of &quot;Fringe&quot; and, in 2014, appeared in the &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; episode &quot;End of the Beginning&quot;.

In 2021, Dourif reprised his role as Chucky in the television series adaptation of the Child&#x27;s Play franchise titled &quot;Chucky&quot;.

=== Music ===
In 2012, Dourif contributed spoken word vocals to three songs on the album &quot;Misery Together&quot; by the Norwegian duo Thinguma*jigSaw. Dourif also appears in the music videos for &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; (1984) by Toto and &quot;Drinking from the Bottle&quot; (2012) by Calvin Harris.

=== Semi-retirement ===
On April 18, 2024, Dourif announced that he would be retiring from acting, with the exception of any Chucky-related projects involving the character. The reason behind this was because of his daughter Fiona (who plays Nica Pierce in the franchise), plus he considered &quot;Chucky&quot; creator Don Mancini to be &quot;family&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Dourif has been married twice; first to Janet Stephanie, with whom he had daughter Kristina/Christina Dourif (b. 1976), and then to Jonina Dourif, with whom he had another daughter, actress Fiona Dourif (b. 1981).

<doc id="454022" wikidata="Q771553" url="?curid=454022" title="Day of Defeat">
<text>Day of Defeat is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter video game set in the European theatre of World War II on the Western front. Originally a modification of the 1998 game &quot;Half-Life&quot;, the rights of the modification were purchased by Valve and released as a full retail title in 2003.

Set in the midst of World War II, &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; includes no single-player campaign, with focus left only on the game&#x27;s multiplayer aspects. The game favors teamwork and features objective-based gameplay in combination with its system of classes. Maps are primarily made up of narrow paths, all of which typically lead to a few key locations. An official remake of the game, &quot;Day of Defeat: Source&quot;, was released by Valve in 2005.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Day of Defeat&quot; is a multiplayer first-person shooter that simulates squad-level infantry combat between the adversaries of World War II&#x27;s European Theatre; the Allies and the Axis powers. Players can choose to join either the Allied or Axis armies, with the Allies including the United States or Great Britain and the Axis including Germany.

A round begins with two opposing teams starting simultaneously in their respective spawn area of a map, both acting towards the goal of achieving their respective objectives whilst preventing the enemy team from accomplishing theirs. A round ends when one team accomplishes all of its objectives, with that team claiming victory. Eventually, the game ends with the expiration of a set time limit, and the team with the most objectives achieved is the winning team regardless of kills or casualties, except in the case of both teams having not achieved any objectives or having achieved the same number of objectives.

Weaponry in the game attempts to realistically portray those that would be found in World War II, and the gameplay reflects this aesthetic choice. Recoil can be heavy and the game does not allow the player to fire while running or jumping. The game also features a stamina bar, preventing the player from sprinting for long periods of time and forcing them to actively conserve energy.

== Setting ==

&quot;Day of Defeat&#x27;s&quot; initial retail offering included fifteen maps, each depicting different scenarios with variation in size and thematic locations. These often drew inspiration from historical World War II battles, such as the battle at Omaha Beach and street-fighting in the Italian city of Salerno during Operation Avalanche. The game also features a Glider mission wherein the American 101st Airborne lands in a WACO Glider and destroys such objectives as a radio antenna and Flak 88 mm gun anti-aircraft gun.

Weapons in the game are also of historical significance, with much of the weaponry being accurate representations of those used in World War II. The weapon selection is also realistic in its usage, with recoil and accuracy representative of the gun&#x27;s real-life counterparts.

==Development==
&quot;Day of Defeat&quot; began as a third-party &quot;Half-Life&quot; modification in 2000. In the initial release of the modification, each class&#x27; movement was unique. This differential, however, was removed with the release of Beta 2.0 in October 2001. Beta 2.0 also introduced new weapons and reduced player accuracy while moving, which caused significant changes to the gameplay. In July 2002, Beta 3.0 was released with a new class, the Allied Sergeant, and a new game mode in which players would only respawn upon the beginning of a new round.

While the first versions of &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; were distributed over the internet at no cost, the rights to the game were later purchased by Valve and the modding team hired. Valve then produced a stand-alone retail version of the game, published by Activision and released in May 2003. The retail version included a number of changes from the modification, including improved graphics and fifteen maps, ten of which were completely new. Friendly-fire, which was previously enabled by default, was disabled in the retail version, bleeding - losing small amounts of health over time caused by injuries which &quot;bled&quot; - was removed, and a mini-map was added to more easily facilitate navigation and cooperation between fellow team members. UI improvements, including identifiers for differentiating team members from enemies and help messages that acted as a tutorial for new players, were also introduced in the retail release.

At the end of July 2004, Valve shut down the World Opponent Network (WON) in favor of their digital distribution service Steam. All servers using the former were shut down and migrated to Steam, forcing players to use the new storefront to access &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;. In 2013, Valve released an update for &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;, alongside other GoldSrc games developed by Valve, which included versions of the game for Mac OS X and Linux.
A major update of Half-Life was released on November 17, 2023. This update carried over to Day of Defeat, providing improved graphics and game options. A number of patch updates have occurred since then and are ongoing as of early 2024.

== Reception ==
&quot;Day of Defeat&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the game for its use of narrow spaces to stimulate the game&#x27;s &quot;relentless pacing&quot;, and GameSpy spoke highly of its attention to detail. Reviewers also praised &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; for its promotion of teamwork through purposefully tight corridors that force players to cooperate, lest they be killed by an enemy outside their field of vision.

Both GameSpy and GameSpot levied criticism against the game for its sub-par visuals and &quot;downright ugly&quot; color palette, blaming the aging GoldSrc engine for the aesthetic issues. Many reviewers drew parallels between &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; and &quot;Battlefield 1942&quot;, the latter of which had been released only six months prior to the former. Both games were set in World War II and featured gameplay that was heavily reliant on their respective class-based systems, which lead reviewers to make direct comparisons between the two in their reviews of &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;. The game was also faulted for its lack of usable vehicles, contrasting &quot;Battlefield&quot;&#x27;s usage of operable vehicles as a key gameplay component.

&quot;PC Gamer US&quot; awarded &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; its 2001 &quot;Mod of the Year&quot; prize. The editors wrote, &quot;Made by amateur developers not yet of American drinking age, &quot;Day of Defeat&quot; absorbed entire weeks of office LAN play.&quot;

=== Legacy ===

&quot;Day of Defeat&quot; was followed by &quot;Day of Defeat: Source&quot;, a remake of the game that runs on Valve&#x27;s Source engine. The Source remake included significant changes to &quot;Day of Defeat&quot;&#x27;s gameplay, new maps, updated graphics, and improved physics.

Released on September 26, 2005 to favorable reviews, the game was praised for its gameplay, audio, and graphics. Post-release, the game was supported by Valve with a number of subsequent updates, including versions of the game for OS X and Linux released in 2010 and 2013 respectively.

<doc id="454024" wikidata="Q7134022" url="?curid=454024" title="Paracosm">
<text>A paracosm is a detailed imaginary world thought generally to originate in childhood. The creator of a paracosm has a complex and deeply felt relationship with this subjective universe, which may incorporate real-world or imaginary characters and conventions. Commonly having its own geography, history, and language, it is an experience that is often developed during childhood and continues over a long period of time, months or even years, as a sophisticated reality that can last into adulthood.

== Origin and usage ==
The concept was first described by Robert Silvey, with later research by British psychiatrist Stephen A. MacKeith and British psychologist David Cohen. The term &quot;paracosm&quot; was coined by Ben Vincent, a participant in Silvey&#x27;s 1976 study and a self-professed paracosmist.

Psychiatrists Delmont Morrison and Shirley Morrison mention paracosms and &quot;paracosmic fantasy&quot; in their book &quot;Memories of Loss and Dreams of Perfection&quot;, in the context of people who have suffered the death of a loved one or some other tragedy in childhood. For such people, paracosms function as a way of processing and understanding their early loss. They cite J. M. Barrie, Isak Dinesen and Emily Bront√´ as examples of people who created paracosms after the deaths of family members.

Marjorie Taylor is another child development psychologist who explores paracosms as part of a study on imaginary friends. In Adam Gopnik&#x27;s essay &quot;Bumping Into Mr. Ravioli&quot;, he consults his sister, a child psychologist, about his three-year-old daughter&#x27;s imaginary friend. He is introduced to Taylor&#x27;s ideas and told that children invent paracosms as a way of orienting themselves in reality. Similarly, creativity scholar Michele Root-Bernstein discusses her daughter&#x27;s invention of an imaginary world, one that lasted for over a decade, in the 2014 book, &quot;Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity&quot;.

Paracosms are also mentioned in articles about types of childhood creativity and problem-solving. Some scholars believe paracosm play indicates high intelligence. A Michigan State University study undertaken by Root-Bernstein revealed that many MacArthur Fellows Program recipients had paracosms as children, thus engaging in what she calls worldplay. Sampled MacArthur Fellows were twice as likely to have engaged in childhood worldplay than MSU undergraduates. They were also significantly more likely than MSU students to recognize aspects of worldplay in their adult professional work. Paracosm play is recognized as one of the indicators of a high level of creativity, which educators now realize is as important as intelligence. 

In an article in the &quot;International Handbook on Giftedness&quot;, Root-Bernstein writes about paracosm play in childhood as an indicator of considerable creative potential, which may &quot;supplement objective measures of intellectual giftedness ... as well as subjective measures of superior technical talent.&quot; There is a chapter on paracosm play in the 2013 textbook &quot;Children, Childhood and Cultural Heritage&quot;, written by Christine Alexander. She sees it, along with independent writing, as attempts by children to create agency for themselves.

Paracosms are one of the subjects of interest to the emerging field of literary juvenilia, studying the childhood writings of well-known and lesser-known authors. Joetta Harty in her essay &quot;Imagining the Nation, Imagining an Empire: A Tour of Nineteenth-Century British Paracosms&quot; contextualizes the paracosms of 19th-century British children, including the Bront√´ family, Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s Gombroon and Hartley Coleridge&#x27;s Ejuxria, with then-current events. Nike Sulway in A Date with Barbara&#x27;: Paracosms of the Self in Biographies of Barbara Newhall Follett&quot; explores adult reaction to children perceived as prodigies or geniuses, focusing on how their biographies often focus on their imaginations and paracosmic creations rather than on their daily lives, citing as an example adult reactions to child author Barbara Newhall Follett. In &quot;Virtual Play and the Victorian Novel&quot;, Timothy Gao focuses on &quot;paracosmic play or worldplay&quot; on the part of De Quincey, Coleridge, Charlotte Bront√´, Anna Jameson, Thomas Malkin and Anthony Trollope.

== Examples ==

Examples of paracosms include:

* The world of Pandora in the science fiction epic Avatar was first dreamed of by James Cameron in his early teens and added to over the course of his life. Not until the technology was possible in the late 2000s did he finally start production on it.
* Gondal, Angria, and Gaaldine, the fantasy kingdoms created and written about in childhood by Emily, Anne, and Charlotte Bront√´, and their brother Branwell, and maintained well into adulthood. These kingdoms are specifically referred to as paracosms in several academic works.
* Pamela Russell, Head of Education and Andrew W. Mellon Curator of Academic Programs for the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College, specifically uses the word &quot;paracosm&quot; in describing the imaginary world created by Goshen, New Hampshire teens Walter, Arthur and Elmer Nelson in the 1890s and chronicled in a collection of miniature books.
* K.C. Remington has written over twenty books in the &quot;Webbster and Button Children&#x27;s Stories&quot; series, set in a paracosm called the Big Green Woods.
* Hartley Coleridge created and maintained the land of Ejuxria all his life.
*Austin Tappan Wright&#x27;s &quot;Islandia&quot; began as a childhood paracosm.
*M. A. R. Barker began developing T√©kumel at age ten.
*Ed Greenwood (born 1959) began writing stories about the Forgotten Realms as a child, starting around 1967; they were his &quot;dream space for swords and sorcery stories&quot;.
* Borovnia, the fantasy kingdom created by Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker in their mid-teens, as portrayed in the film &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot;.
* The modern fantasy author Steph Swainston&#x27;s world of &quot;the Fourlands&quot; originated as an early childhood paracosm.
* Henry Darger began writing about the Realms of the Unreal in his late teens and continued to write and illustrate it for decades.
* Joanne Greenberg created a paracosm called Iria as a young girl, and described it to Frieda Fromm-Reichmann while hospitalized at Chestnut Lodge. Fromm-Reichmann wrote about it in an article for the &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot;; Greenberg wrote about it as the Kingdom of Yr in her novel &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot;.
* As children, novelist C. S. Lewis and his brother Warren together created a paracosm called Boxen which was, in turn, a combination of their respective private paracosms Animal-Land and India. Lewis later drew upon Animal-Land to create the fantasy land of Narnia, the setting of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;.
* The documentary film &quot;Marwencol&quot; centres on an imaginary town created by artist Mark Hogancamp as a kind of therapy for trauma and brain injury brought about by a violent assault.
* Artist Renaldo Kuhler invented a fictional country called Rocaterrania as a teenager, and continued creating and illustrating it for the rest of his life.
* Additional paracosmists are listed in Michele Root-Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Inventing Imaginary Worlds: From Childhood Play to Adult Creativity Across the Arts and Sciences&quot; in 2014, and on the related website, &quot;Inventing Imaginary Worlds&quot;.

<text>A boy soprano (British and especially North American English) or boy treble (only British English) is a young male singer with a voice in the soprano range, a range that is often still called the treble voice range (in North America too) no matter how old.

== Origins ==
In the Anglican and English Catholic liturgical traditions (in which girls and women did not sing in church choirs), young male choristers were normally referred to as &quot;trebles&quot; rather than as boy sopranos, but today the term &quot;boy trebles&quot; is increasingly common (girls with high voices are trebles too). The term &quot;treble&quot; derives from the Latin &#x27;, used in 13th and 14th century motets to indicate the third and highest range, which was sung above the tenor part (which carried the tune) and the alto part. Another term for that range is &#x27;. The term &quot;treble&quot; itself was first used in the 15th century. Trebles have an average range of A3 to F5 (220‚Äì700¬†Hz).

The term &quot;boy soprano&quot; originated with Dr Henry Stephen Cutler (1825‚Äì1902), choirmaster of the Cecilian Choir, New York, who used the term for both the choir members and soloists, who were church choristers, when giving concerts in public halls. The earliest use found can be traced to a choral festival at Irving Hall, New York, in May 1866.

== Short-lived range ==

Most trebles have a comfortable range from the A below &quot;middle C&quot; (A3, 220¬†Hz) to the F one and a half octaves above &quot;middle C&quot; (F5, 698¬†Hz), roughly corresponding to an adult male baritone range, up one octave. Some writing demands higher notes; the Anglican church repertory, which many trained trebles to sing, frequently demands G5 (784¬†Hz) and A5 (880¬†Hz). Some trebles, however, can extend their voices higher in the modal register to &quot;high C&quot; (C6, 1046¬†Hz). The high C is considered the defining note of the soprano voice type. For high notes see, for example, the treble solo at the beginning of Stanford&#x27;s &quot; in G&quot;, David Willcocks&#x27; descant to Mendelssohn&#x27;s tune for the carol &quot;Hark, the Herald Angels Sing&quot;, the even higher treble solo from Gregorio Allegri&#x27;s &#x27;, and the treble part in the &#x27; from Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Evening Canticles&quot; written for St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Many trebles are also able to reach higher notes by use of the whistle register but this practice is rarely called for and writing above high C is very rare in choral music of any kind.

As a boy approaches and begins to undergo puberty, the quality of his voice increasingly distinguishes itself from that typical of girls. The voice takes on a resonant masculine quality before its pitch drops, resulting in a liminal stage wherein the boy may sing in a high register with a unique timbre. This brief period of high vocal range and unique color forms much of the ground for the use of the boy soprano in both liturgical and secular music in the Western world and elsewhere. Occasionally boys whose voices have changed can continue to sing in the soprano range for a period of time. This stage ends as the boy&#x27;s larynx continues to grow and, with the breaking of his voice, he becomes unable to sing the highest notes required by the pieces of music involved.

It has been observed that boy sopranos in earlier times were, on average, somewhat older than in modern times. For example, Franz Joseph Haydn was considered to be an excellent boy soprano well into his teens and Ernest Lough was 15 when he first recorded his famous &quot;Hear My Prayer&quot; (on 5 April 1927), with his voice not getting deeper until sometime in 1929, when he was either 17 or 18 years old. However, for a male to sing soprano with an unchanged voice in his mid-to-late teens is currently fairly uncommon. In the developed world, puberty tends to begin at younger ages (most likely due to differences in diet, including greater availability of proteins and vitamins). It is also becoming more widely known that the style of singing and voice training within cathedrals has changed significantly in the past century, making it more difficult for boys to continue singing soprano much beyond the age of 13 or 14, with the raising of concert pitch being one factor.

Early breaking of boys&#x27; voices due to puberty becoming earlier in recent times is causing a serious problem for choirmasters.

On the other hand, some musicologists dispute that earlier onset of puberty occurs. They contend that there is no reliable evidence of any significant change in the age of boys&#x27; maturity over the past 500 years or even beyond that. A counterargument to this viewpoint is the paucity of bearded fourteen-year-olds from the historical record, the increased incidence of precocious puberty diagnoses, and availability of testosterone replacement therapy that many parents of boys experiencing delayed adolescence or intersex conditions opt to undergo.

== Notable boy sopranos ==
* Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day frontman) recorded a song titled &quot;Look For Love&quot; at the age of five. He is now a tenor.

<text>Itzcoatl ( , &quot;Obsidian Serpent&quot;, ) (c. 1380‚Äì1440) was the fourth king of Tenochtitlan, and the founder of the Aztec Empire, ruling from 1427 to 1440. Under Itzcoatl the Mexica of Tenochtitlan threw off the domination of the Tepanecs and established the Triple Alliance (Aztec Empire) together with the other city-states Tetzcoco and Tlacopan.

== Biography ==
Itzcoatl was the natural son of &quot;tl√†toƒÅni&quot; Acamapichtli and an unknown Tepanec woman from Azcapotzalco. He was elected as the king when his predecessor, his nephew Chimalpopoca, was killed by Maxtla of the nearby Tepanec &quot;ƒÅltepƒìtl&quot; (city-state) of Azcapotzalco. Allying with Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco, Itzcoatl went on to defeat Maxtla and end the Tepanec domination of central Mexico.

After this victory, Itzcoatl, Nezahualcoyotl, and Totoquilhuaztli, king of Tlacopan, forged what would become known as the Aztec Triple Alliance, forming the basis of the eventual Aztec Empire.

Itzcoatl next turned his attention to the &quot;chinampas&quot; districts on the south shores of Lakes Xochimilco and Chalco. Fresh water springs lining these shores had allowed the development of extensive raised gardens, or &quot;chinampas&quot;, set on the shallow lake floors. Successful campaigns against Xochimilco (1430), Mixquic (1432), Cuitlahuac (1433), and Tezompa would secure agricultural resources for Tenochtitlan and, along with the conquest of Culhuacan and Coyoac√°n, would cement the Triple Alliance&#x27;s control over the southern half of the Valley of Mexico.

With this string of victories, Itzcoatl took the title &quot;Culhua teuctli&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Culhua&quot;, while Totoquilhuaztli, king of Tlacopan, took the title &quot;Tepaneca teuctli&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Tepanecs&quot;.

In 1439, Itzcoatl undertook a campaign outside the Valley of Mexico against Cuauhnahuac (Cuernavaca).

According to the Florentine Codex, Itzcoatl ordered the burning of all historical codices because it was &quot;not wise that all the people should know the paintings&quot;. Among other purposes, this allowed the Aztec state to develop a state-sanctioned official history and mythos that venerated Huitzilopochtli.

Itzcoatl also continued the building of Tenochtitlan: during his reign temples, roads, and a causeway were built. Itzcoatl established the religious and governmental hierarchy that was assumed by his nephew Moctezuma I upon his death in 1440.

== Family ==
Itzcoatl was a son of Acamapichtli and half-brother of Huitzilihuitl. He was an uncle of Chimalpopoca and Moctezuma I.

He married princess Huacaltzintli and had a son Tezozomoc

<doc id="454033" wikidata="Q765874" url="?curid=454033" title="Maya Mountains">
<text>The Maya Mountains are a mountain range located in Belize and eastern Guatemala, in Central America.

== Etymology ==
The Maya Mountains were known as the &quot;Cockscomb&quot; or &quot;Coxcomb Mountains&quot; to Baymen and later Belizeans at least until the mid-20th century. Their current appellation is thought to be in honour of the Mayan civilisation.
== Geography ==

=== Physical ===
==== Peaks ====
The range&#x27;s highest peaks are Doyle&#x27;s Delight at and Victoria Peak at .

==== Rivers ====
Nine streams with a Strahler order greater than 1 flow from the Mountains into the Caribbean Sea, namely, five tributaries of the Belize River, two tributaries of the Monkey River, and the Sittee River and Boom Creek.

==== Karst ====
Prominent karstic features within the Mountains include the Chiquibul Spring and Cave System, the Vaca Plateau, the Southern and Northern Boundary Faults, and possibly an aquifer contiguous with that of the Yucat√°n Peninsula.

==== Plutons ====
The Mountains &#x27;are the only source of igneous and metamorphic materials&#x27; in Belize. These are exposed in three plutons, i.e. Mountain Pine Ridge, Hummingbird Ridge, and the Cockscomb Basin. It has been recently suggested that the former was mined by stonemasons at Pacbitun for the manufacture and trade of stonetools, e.g. &quot;manos&quot; and &quot;metates&quot;.

==== Climate ====
Precipitation decreases from per annum in the northwestern extreme of the Mountains to per annum in its southeastern extreme.

=== Human ===
==== Parks ====
Much of the Mountains is in protected areas spanning seventeen parks, reserves, sanctuaries, or monuments in southern Belize and northern Guatemala.

====Important Bird Area====
The site, comprising several large forest, nature and archaeological reserves in the mountains, has been designated a 645,000¬†ha Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of numerous resident and passage bird species.

==== Threats ====
Unauthorised farming and resource extraction by Guatemalans have been identified as a significant threats to Belize&#x27;s protected areas bordering Peten. For instance, in 2008 an estimated 1,0001,500 &quot;xateros&quot; i.e. fishtail palm foragers were operating in the region, and by 2011 some 13,50020,000 acres had been cleared for various agricultural activities, thereby severing the ecologically important contiguity of Belizean forests to the Guatemalan &quot;Selva Maya&quot;. Furthermore, unlicensed interlopers often hunt for sustenance during their extended incursions, leading to worrying declines in wildlife populations, such as that of the white-lipped peccary, which has been extirpated from &#x27;was once the species&#x27; primary stronghold in Belize [i.e. Chiquibul].&#x27; Threats indigenous to Belize have also been identified, however, with demographic pressures deemed the most significant. The recent construction of the hydroelectric Chalillo Dam in the Mountains, for instance, &#x27;sparked international controversy for its widespread ecological effects,&#x27; including the inundation of 2,400 acres of forested and riparian ecosystems, and exposure of downstream villages to significant pollutants in 2009 and 2011.
== Geology ==
The Mountains and their abutting foothills and plains, considered as a north-easterly trending structural uplift of Palaeozoic bedrock, constitute a geologic or physiographic province in the Maya Block of the North American Plate. The province is bounded by the seismically inactive Northern and Southern Boundary Faults.

=== History ===
The Mountains&#x27; orogen mainly consists of metamorphosed late Carboniferous to middle Permian volcanic-sedimentary rocks overlying late Silurian granites.

=== Stratigraphy ===

==== Basement ====
The Mountains&#x27; basement is sub-aerially exposed in four extremes of the mountain range. The exposed portions in the northwestern, northeastern, and southeastern points of the range are predominantly composed of intermediate-to-silicic Palaeozoic plutons, with exposed portions in the southern point of the range predominated by Palaeozoic volcanic rocks.

The geologic evolution of the exposed portions of the Mountains&#x27; basement has been deemed &#x27;one of the most disputed aspects of Central American geology,&#x27; though it has subsequently been suggested that these formed during the late-Neogene to late-Pliocene.

==== Cover ====
The Mountains&#x27; sedimentary cover blankets all of the province&#x27;s foothills and plains, and all but a few portions of its mountain range. The cover in the foothills and plains is predominantly composed of Cretacaeous marine strata to the south, west, and north, but this transitions into Quaternary alluvium to the east. In contrast, the cover in the mountain range is predominated by Palaeozoic strata.

The Mountains&#x27; cover in the mountain range has been recently characterised as an elevated relict landscape, i.e. an area where basement uplift has not been counterbalanced by fluvial erosion.

==== Formation ====
Geologic mapping and dating of rocks in the Maya Mountains have &#x27;led to a variety of interpretations and eventually to puzzling discrepancies between reported field relations, age of fossils, and geochronologic data.&#x27; An early 1955 study divided the Mountains&#x27; sedimentary rocks into &quot;Macal&quot; and &quot;Maya&quot; series or formations, but these were subsequently rejected in favour of the single &quot;Santa Rosa Group&quot; of sedimentary rocks (discovered in Guatemala in 1966). However, this consensus was upended upon the 1996 discovery of deeper granitoids which crystallisation ages &#x27;considerably older&#x27; than known post-Devonian ages of &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; fossils. The presence of pre-Devonian sediments was &#x27;a matter of debate&#x27; until &#x27;conclusively demonstrate[d]&#x27; in the affirmative in 2009.

=== Morphology ===
==== Basins ====
The Mountains are wedged between the easterly to northeasterly trending Corozal and Belize Basins, themselves sub-basins of the PetenCorozal Basin, which fully encompasses the Mountains.
== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian ===
The Mountains are thought to have remained sparsely populated, and culturally and economically isolated, until 600830 CE, during the Late Classic, when the region experienced major demographic growth, possibly peaking in the 8th century. In CE, during the Classic Maya Collapse, most of the Mountains&#x27; settlements experienced demographic decline, leading to sparse settlement during the Postclassic.

=== Columbian ===
The mountains are mainly made of Paleozoic era granite and sediments.
The Maya Mountains and associated foothills contain a number of important Mayan ruins including the sites of Lubaantun, Nim Li Punit, Cahal Pech and Chaa Creek.

==== Conservation ====
===== In Belize =====
The earliest public conservation-like efforts in Belize are thought to have been geared towards regulating mahogany logging, via a 28 October 1817 proclamation vesting unclaimed lands in the Crown. The measure quickly proved futile however, as by 17 April 1835 Belize&#x27;s Superintendent would note that &#x27;no regulation or restriction has prevailed respecting the cutting of Wood or the occupation of Land and thus the mahogany on the extensive Tracts to the Southward of the Sibun and between the Rivers Belize &amp; Hondo above Black Creek has been subjected to great waste and devastation.&#x27; The next step is thought to have been in 1894, with the passage of the first legislative protections for antiquities in colonial Belize, subsequently strengthened in 1897, 1924, and 1927. Archaeological conservation in Belize progressed quickly with the 1952 appointment of Alexander Hamilton Anderson as First Assistant Secretary to the Governor &quot;with&quot; responsibility for archaeological activities in the country, and the subsequent 1954 establishment of the Department of Archaeology, with Anderson as its inaugural &quot;commissioner&quot; or permanent secretary. Natural conservation likewise advanced with the 1887 Hooper and 1921 Hummel Reports, the 1922 establishment of a Department of Forestry, with Cornelius Hummel as inaugural &quot;conservator&quot; or permanent secretary, and the 1924, 1926, 1927, 1935, 1944, and 1945 passages of legislative protections for flora and fauna. Significantly, Silk Grass and Mountain Pine Ridge were gazetted as &quot;forest reserves&quot; in 1920, making these Belize&#x27;s earliest non-archaeological protected areas.

===== In Guatemala =====
The earliest conservation efforts in Guatemala are thought to have been the 1921 and 1945 &quot;Leyes Forestales&quot;, leading to the 1955 establishment of the country&#x27;s first protected areas, the Atitl√°n and Rio Dulce National Parks.
== Study ==
=== Exploration ===
The earliest known exploratory expedition into the Mountains was led by captains Samuel Harrison and Valent√≠n Delgado in . The captains had been commissioned by the superintendent of colonial Belize, Edward Marcus Despard, and the visiting Spanish commissary, Enrique de Grimarest, to discover the source of the Sibun River, so as to ascertain the limits of the British settlement under the 1786 Convention of London.

Subsequent pioneering explorations were led by Henry Fowler in 1879, C. H. Wilson in 1886, Karl Sapper in 18861935, J. Bellamy in 1888, L. H. Ower in 19221926, C. G. Dixon in 19501955, and J. H. Bateson and I. H. S. Hall in 19691970. Sapper&#x27;s trips have been deemed &#x27;the first geologic expeditions&#x27; into the Mountains, while Ower&#x27;s survey produced what has been called &#x27;the first geological map of the Colony [of British Honduras, including the Mountains].&#x27;

<text>Laveranues Leon Coles (; born December 29, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), primarily with the New York Jets. He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles. He was selected by the New York Jets in the third round of the 2000 NFL draft. A Pro Bowl selection in 2003, Coles also played for the Washington Redskins and Cincinnati Bengals.

==Early life==
Coles was born in Jacksonville, Florida. While attending Ribault High School in Jacksonville, Coles played football, basketball, and ran track. In football, he rushed for nearly 5,000 yards in his career, was named to the Blue Chip Dream Team, and was a first team Class 4A All-State selection. In basketball, he was a member of a state championship team as a senior. In track, he recorded a time of 10.6 seconds in the 100 meter and 21.8 seconds in the 200 meter on the Ribault track team. Due to a scandal at Florida State which resulted in Coles&#x27;s dismissal from the team, he often referred to his high school when introducing himself on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

==College career==
On September 29, 1999, during his senior season at Florida State, Coles and teammate Peter Warrick went to a Tallahassee, Florida Dillard&#x27;s department store and, with the aid of a cashier with whom they were friendly, purchased $412.38 worth of clothing and were charged only $21.40‚Äîa discount so large that it is considered shoplifting under Florida law. An off-duty officer saw the event through a surveillance camera, according to police. Coles, Warrick, and the clerk, were arrested for grand theft. On October 22, Coles pleaded guilty to misdemeanor petty theft and was dismissed from the Florida State Seminoles football team. At that year&#x27;s rivalry game at the University of Florida, Florida Gators fans brought Dillard&#x27;s bags to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium to mock the team. Florida State won the game, and Seminole fans returned the mocking by requesting the bags as souvenirs.

Coles&#x27;s childhood nickname was &quot;Trouble&quot;. Coles was arrested in 1998 for simple battery, suspended for the Seminoles&#x27; 1999 season opener versus Louisiana Tech for academic reasons, and was discovered to have accepted a plane ticket from a sports agent&#x27;s representative in 1999.

==Professional career==
===New York Jets (first stint)===
Coles was selected by the New York Jets in the third round (78th overall) of the 2000 NFL draft. Coles&#x27; first career touchdown catch came in the Jets&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Miracle&quot; victory against the Miami Dolphins on October 23, 2000. As a rookie, he finished with 23 receptions for 370 yards and one touchdown in 13 games and three starts.

===Washington Redskins===
After a spectacular 2002 season, Coles signed with the Washington Redskins in the 2002 offseason. He said he left the Jets because the Redskins offered him more money. He made the Pro Bowl for the Redskins in 2003, after catching 82 passes for 1,204 yards, while playing the majority of the season with a fractured toe. It was the most receptions by a Washington player in a single season since Art Monk had 86 in 1989.

===New York Jets (second stint)===
He was traded back to the Jets in 2005 for Santana Moss. During the first year of his second stint with the Jets, Coles revealed that he had been sexually abused between ages 10 to 13 by a man whom his mother, Sirretta married. Coles refused to divulge the man&#x27;s name. After the abuse was revealed, Sirretta Coles divorced the man, who was later sentenced to nine years in prison. He served about a third of his sentence and was released. He was convicted of another crime and has been imprisoned since 2001.

After a disappointing season in 2005, Coles enjoyed a rebirth in 2006, partly due to the good health of quarterback, Chad Pennington. On December 26, 2006, he caught the last touchdown on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;&#x27;s last game on ABC. On September 28, 2008, now with Brett Favre at quarterback, Coles caught 8 passes for 105 yards and 3 touchdowns in a 56‚Äì35 win over the Arizona Cardinals. That season, Coles tied his career high season touchdown mark that he set in 2001, with 7 touchdowns.

Coles was released by the Jets on February 25, 2009.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
Coles was signed by the Cincinnati Bengals on March 4, 2009. He would agree in principle to a four-year, $28 million contract. On January 9, 2010, Coles caught 6 passes for 48 yards and a touchdown in a 24‚Äì14 loss to his former team, the Jets, in the first round of the playoffs.

He was released by the Bengals on March 4, 2010, exactly one year after signing with the organization.

===New York Jets (third stint)===
The Jets announced Coles had been signed to a one-year contract on July 30, 2010. However, his stay would be brief as the team waived Coles after nearly a month on August 29, 2010.

On September 21, 2010, Coles was talked about in the media as an option to fill in for Braylon Edwards, who was charged with a DWI the previous night. Coles contemplated retirement.

On December 4, 2010, the Jets filled their open roster spot by signing Coles to yet another contract reuniting him with the Jets. The roster spot had been vacated when Jim Leonhard was placed on injured reserve with a fractured tibia. Coles was able to rejoin the team in time for their Monday night game against the New England Patriots for Week 13 of the NFL&#x27;s 2010 season.

<text>Laurence Michael Yep (; born June 14, 1948) is an American writer. He is known for his children&#x27;s books, having won the Newbery Honor twice for his &quot;Golden Mountain&quot; series. In 2005, he received the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award for his career contribution to American children&#x27;s literature.

== Life, education, and career ==

Yep was born in San Francisco, California, in Chinatown to Thomas (Gim Lew) Yep and Franche Lee Yep. His father was a first-generation American born in China who had moved to San Francisco as a boy. His mother was a second-generation Chinese American, was born in Ohio and raised in West Virginia where her family ran a Chinese laundry. After struggling through the Great Depression, Yep&#x27;s family moved to a multicultural but predominantly African American neighborhood. Yep grew up working in the family grocery store, where he recalls learning early on &quot;how to observe and listen to people, how to relate to others. It was good training for a writer.&quot;

Yep was named by his older brother Thomas, who had just been studying the biography of Saint Lawrence for school. He spent his early childhood commuting from his neighborhood to a Catholic school in Chinatown for Chinese children, where he was often made fun of by the mostly bilingual students for only knowing how to speak English.

Not until high school when Yep attended a less segregated Catholic school did he confront white American culture in person, having grown up among Black and Chinese kids. Although he had always been interested in science, at St. Ignatius College Preparatory, he also became interested in literature and creative writing. Yep published his first story in a science fiction magazine at the age of 18 while still in high school. His English teacher, a Jesuit priest, motivated him to submit his story to magazines until it got published if he wanted to get an A grade. This experience inspired Yep to first consider what a career in writing might be like, even though he had always been fascinated with machines and wanted to become a chemist.

Yep graduated from St. Ignatius College Preparatory in 1966.

His decision to become a writer did not come until he entered college at Marquette University. There he became friends with a literary magazine editor, Joanne Ryder, whom he eventually married. She introduced him to children&#x27;s literature and later encouraged him to write a book for children while she was working at Harper &amp; Row. The result was his first science fiction novel for teens entitled &quot;Sweetwater&quot;, published by Harper &amp; Row in 1973. After two years at Marquette, Yep transferred to UC Santa Cruz where he earned a BA in 1970. He later earned a PhD in English at the State University of New York at Buffalo.

== Writing career ==

Growing up, Yep often felt torn between mainstream American culture and his Chinese roots, a theme he has often written about. A great deal of his work involves characters feeling alienated or not fitting into their environment, something Yep has said he struggled with since childhood: &quot;I was too American to fit into Chinatown, and too Chinese to fit in anywhere else.&quot;

During his writing career, Yep also taught creative writing and Asian-American studies at the University of California, Berkeley and UC Santa Barbara.

Yep&#x27;s most notable collection of works is the &quot;Golden Mountain Chronicles&quot;, documenting the fictional Young family from 1849 in China to 1995 in America. Two of the series are Newbery Honor Books, or runners-up for the annual Newbery Medal: &quot;Dragonwings&quot; (Harper &amp; Row, 1975) and &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot; (HarperCollins, 1993). &quot;Dragonwings&quot; won the Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association in 1995, recognizing the best children&#x27;s book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award. It won the Carter G. Woodson Book Award in 1976, and has been adapted as a play under its original title. Another of the Chronicles, &quot;Child of the Owl&quot; won the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award for children&#x27;s fiction in 1977. (&quot;The Rainbow People&quot;, Yep&#x27;s collection of short stories based on Chinese folktales and legends, was a Horn Book runner-up in 1989.)

Yep wrote two other notable series, &quot;Chinatown Mysteries&quot; and &quot;Dragon&quot; (1982 to 1992). The latter is an adaptation of Chinese mythology as four fantasy novels.

In 2005 the professional children&#x27;s librarians awarded Yep the Children&#x27;s Literature Legacy Award, which recognizes an author or illustrator whose books, published in the United States, have made &quot;a substantial and lasting contribution to literature for children&quot;. The committee noted that &quot;Yep explores the dilemma of the cultural outsider&quot; with &quot;attention to the complexity and conflict within and across cultures&quot; and it cited four works in particular: &quot;Dragonwings&quot;, &quot;The Rainbow People&quot;, &quot;The Khan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and the autobiographical &quot;The Lost Garden&quot;.

A live-action/CGI TV movie of &quot;The Tiger&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, adapted by David Magee, was being developed by Cartoon Network until it was cancelled after Cartoon Network stopped developing live-action projects. In March 2019, Paramount Pictures announced an animated film adaptation of the book with a script by Magee and a release date of February 2, 2024.

== Personal life ==
Yep married the writer Joanne Ryder in 1984. They live in Pacific Grove, California.

<doc id="454066" wikidata="Q6926702" url="?curid=454066" title="Movement for a New Society">
<text>The Movement for a New Society (MNS) was a U.S.-based network of social activist collectives, committed to the principles of nonviolence, who played a key role in social movements of the 1970s and 1980s.

According to a description from the MNS publication, &quot;Building Social Change Communities&quot; (1979),

:Movement for a New Society (MNS) is a nationwide network of groups working for fundamental social change through nonviolent action. Together we are developing an analysis of present-day society; a vision of a decentralized, democratic and caring social order; a nonviolent revolutionary strategy; and a program based on changed values and changed lives.

==History==
The precursor to the MNS was A Quaker Action Group (AQAG), founded by Lawrence Scott (Quaker) in 1966. Dissatisfied with the response of the mainstream Quaker church to the United States involvement in the Vietnam War, Scott founded AQAG with the intention of sparking a renewed commitment to the Quaker Peace Testimony.

Frustrated by their failure to achieve this end, AQAG members including Scott and Quaker George Willoughby, refashioned the group as the Movement for A New Society in 1971. Other founding members included Bill Moyer, Berit and George Lakey, Phyllis and Richard Taylor, Lynne Shivers, and Lillian Willoughby.

The members of MNS consciously sought to develop tools and strategies that could be employed to bring about revolutionary change through nonviolent means. The three-part focus of MNS included training for activists, nonviolent direct action and community. The main location for MNS activity was in West Philadelphia. Other locations included Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis, Ohio, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto, Tucson, Western Massachusetts and more.

During the 1970s and early 1980s Philadelphia was the base for weekend, two-week and nine-month programs that trained US and international activists in direct action organizing, group process, consensus decision-making, liberation/oppression issues and more. Activist training also happened in other locations and through traveling trainers programs.

MNS did not focus its energies exclusively on one issue or injustice. Its members were involved in working for social change on many fronts, most notably in the movement to end US involvement in the Vietnam War, and during the citizen-led opposition to the expansion of the US nuclear power industry in the mid to late 1970s. MNS members were also active in the anti-nuclear weapons movement, the Pledge of Resistance (anti-US intervention in Central America), feminism, LGBTQ, civil rights, community organizing, and food and worker cooperatives.

MNS was unusual in combining feminist group process, broad analysis of interrelated people&#x27;s struggles including class and culture, and personal empowerment techniques ranging from music and street theater as political organizing tools to Re-evaluation Counseling. With their group process skills, MNS members often played roles of facilitating meetings and training peacekeepers for large protests. Many MNS-developed techniques, including small-to-large-group consensus decision making, an action structure based on affinity groups, and the idea that proper training was key to successful actions, were widely adopted and adapted by numerous social change campaigns and movements. Prominent among these was the Clamshell Alliance occupation of the Seabrook nuclear power plant construction site May 1, 1977, continuing through the network of affinity-group-based alliances that took direct action for safe energy nationwide and worldwide. MNS also heavily influenced later movements such as the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle and the Occupy movement of 2011-2012. In turn, MNS was greatly influenced by its association with academics and authors, notably Gene Sharp, nonviolent action theoretician, founder of the Albert Einstein Institution (Cambridge, Mass.), and a major global influence on the nonviolent liberation of South Africa, the Arab Spring and other social justice movements.

The sense of community and the quality of interpersonal relationships was important to MNS members and many lived in cooperative households, practiced Re-evaluation Counseling, and addressed issues of race, class, gender and sexual orientation in their activist training and lives. In West Philadelphia MNS members established a land trust incorporated as a nonprofit &quot;Life Center Association&quot;, initially comprising several land trusted buildings to provide training spaces and an organizational office, then expanding to include about 20 cooperative houses at its height. It survives to this day, though far smaller.

Through the cooperatively owned and managed New Society Publishers, MNS members published numerous pamphlets and guidebooks, as well as republishing important works on nonviolence (e.g. &quot;We Are All Part of One Another a Barbara Deming Reader&quot; in 1984). NSP&#x27;s cooperatively authored &quot;Resource Manual for a Living Revolution&quot; (known affectionately as the ‚Äúmonster manual‚Äù) and similar publications inspired and guided activists on every continent, even the Tasmanian Wilderness Society‚Äôs campaign to prevent the damming of the Franklin River in southern Australia. NSP also published Marshall Rosenberg&#x27;s &quot;Handbook on Nonviolent Communication&quot; which became the basis for Rosenberg&#x27;s work with the Center for Nonviolent Communication.

After several years of decline, MNS membership decided to disband in 1988, due to internal differences regarding priorities, lack of success in becoming multicultural, and the decline of its training programs in Philadelphia. However, its most skilled trainers and organizers redirected their efforts, joining or founding a range of organizations and campaigns across the U.S. Many believed MNS had achieved its primary goal of furthering the understanding and use of Gandhian style nonviolent action to effect significant change. MNS records are archived at the Swarthmore College Peace Collection.

==Legacy==
New Society Publishers, now based in British Columbia, continues to publish social-change related titles, with an increased emphasis on the practical aspects of environmental sustainability. Douglas &amp; McIntyre bought New Society Publishers in 2008. It was repurchased by the original Canadian New Society publishing group in 2013.

Until his death in October, 2002, Bill Moyer continued to teach his influential Movement Action Plan, eight-stage model for social change movements, to activists around the US and around the world. George Lakey, as founder of the Philadelphia-based Training for Change organization, continued to promote nonviolence as a powerful technique for resisting injustice, along with other MNS members Betsy Raasch-Gilman and Erika Thorne. MNS alum Steve Chase started an activist training program at Antioch University New England and is now Assistant Director of Solidarity 2020 and Beyond. Shel Horowitz and Dina Friedman promote environmentally and socially responsible business. Other former MNS members (Felice Yeskel, Chuck Collins, Betsy Leondar-Wright, Jerry Koch-Gonzalez, Anne Slepian Ellinger, Christopher Mogil Ellinger) were key in founding and sustaining organizations focused on class issues, such as United for a Fair Economy, Class Action, Bolder Giving, and the Program on Inequality and the Common Good of Institute for Policy Studies. Many continue collaborative leadership in a range of causes and one hundred MNS alumni took part in its 50th Anniversary Reunion November 2022.

<doc id="454067" wikidata="Q263681" url="?curid=454067" title="Gene Sharp">
<text>Gene Sharp (January 21, 1928 ‚Äì January 28, 2018) was an American political scientist. He was the founder of the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the study of nonviolent action, and professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. He was known for his extensive writings on nonviolent struggle, which have influenced numerous anti-government resistance movements around the world.

Sharp received the 2008 Int‚Äôl Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award for his lifelong commitment to the defense of freedom, democracy, and the reduction of political violence through scholarly analysis of the power of nonviolent action. Unofficial sources have claimed that Sharp was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015, and had previously been nominated three times, in 2009, 2012 and 2013. Sharp was widely considered the favorite for the 2012 award. In 2011, he was awarded the El-Hibri Peace Education Prize. In 2012, he was a recipient of the Right Livelihood Award for &quot;developing and articulating the core principles and strategies of nonviolent resistance and supporting their practical implementation in conflict areas around the world&quot;.

==Biography==

Sharp was born in North Baltimore, Ohio, the son of an itinerant Protestant minister. He received a Bachelor of Arts in Social Sciences in 1949 from Ohio State University, where he also received his Master of Arts in Sociology in 1951. In 1953‚Äì54, Sharp was jailed for nine months after protesting the conscription of soldiers for the Korean War. He discussed his decision to go to prison for his beliefs in letters to Albert Einstein, who wrote a foreword to his first book on Gandhi. He worked as factory laborer, guide to a blind social worker, and secretary to A. J. Muste, America&#x27;s leading pacifist. Between 1955 and 1958, he was Assistant Editor of &quot;Peace News&quot; (London), the weekly pacifist newspaper from where he helped organize the 1958 Aldermaston March. The next two years he studied and researched in Oslo with Professor Arne N√¶ss, who together with Johan Galtung drew extensively from Mohandas Gandhi&#x27;s writings in developing the &quot;Satyagraha Norms&quot;. In 1968, he received a Doctor of Philosophy in political theory from Oxford University. Funding for Sharp&#x27;s research at this time came from the DARPA project of the US Department of Defense.

Sharp was appointed a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth in 1972. He held research appointments at Harvard University&#x27;s Center for International Affairs from 1965. 
In 1983 he founded Harvard&#x27;s Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense (PNS), which &quot;continued in the spirit of its founder&quot; and in 1995 was merged with another Harvard organization.
In 1983 Sharp also founded the Albert Einstein Institution, a non-profit organization devoted to studies and promotion of the use of nonviolent action in conflicts worldwide. In 2004, the Albert Einstein Institution lost much of its funding (with income dropping from more than $1m a year to as little as $160,000), and from then on was run out of Sharp&#x27;s home in East Boston, near Logan Airport.

In 2012, he received the Zambrano Foundation Distinguished Lifetime Democracy Award.

Sharp died on January 28, 2018, at home in Boston, having just turned 90.

==Theory of nonviolent resistance==

Gene Sharp described the sources of his ideas as in-depth studies of Mohandas K. Gandhi, A. J. Muste, Henry David Thoreau to a minor degree, and other sources footnoted in his 1973 book &quot;The Politics of Nonviolent Action&quot;, which was based on his 1968 PhD thesis. In the book, he provides a pragmatic political analysis of nonviolent action as a method for applying power in a conflict.

Sharp&#x27;s key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state ‚Äì regardless of its particular structural organization ‚Äì ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects&#x27; obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, rulers have no power.

In Sharp&#x27;s view, all effective power structures have systems by which they encourage or extract obedience from their subjects. States have particularly complex systems for keeping subjects obedient. These systems include specific institutions (police, courts, regulatory bodies, etc.), but may also involve cultural dimensions that inspire obedience by implying that power &quot;is&quot; monolithic (the god cult of the Egyptian pharaohs, the dignity of the office of the president, moral or ethical norms and taboos, etc.). Through these systems, subjects are presented with a system of sanctions (imprisonment, fines, ostracism) and rewards (titles, wealth, fame) which influence the extent of their obedience.

Sharp identifies this hidden structure as providing a window of opportunity for a population to cause significant change in a state. Sharp cites the insight of √âtienne de La Bo√©tie (1530‚Äì1563) that if the subjects of a particular state recognize that they are the source of the state&#x27;s power, they can refuse their obedience and their leader(s) will be left without power.

Sharp published &quot;Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential&quot; in 2005. It builds on his earlier written works and documents case studies where nonviolent action has been applied, presents the lessons learned from those applications, and contains information on planning nonviolent struggle to make it more effective.

&quot;How to Start a Revolution&quot;, a feature documentary by the Scottish director Ruaridh Arrow about the global influence of Gene Sharp&#x27;s work, was released in September 2011. The film won &quot;Best Documentary&quot; and the &quot;Mass Impact Award&quot; at the Boston Film Festival in September 2011. The European premiere was held at London&#x27;s Raindance Film Festival on October 2, 2011, where it also won Best Documentary. A biography of Gene Sharp by Ruaridh Arrow based on the documentary was released in 2020.

==Influence on struggles worldwide==
Sharp has been called both the &quot;Machiavelli of nonviolence&quot; and the &quot;Clausewitz of nonviolent warfare.&quot; It is claimed by some that Sharp&#x27;s scholarship has influenced resistance organizations around the world. His works remain the ideological underpinning of the work for the Serbian-based nonviolent conflict training group the Centre for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies which helped to train the key activists in the protest movement that toppled President Mubarak of Egypt, and many other earlier youth movements in the Eastern European color revolutions.

Sharp&#x27;s 1993 handbook &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy&quot; was first published in Burma, fourth edition in 2010. It has since been translated into at least 31 other languages. It has served as a basis for the campaigns of Serbia&#x27;s Otpor! (who were also directly trained by the Albert Einstein Institution), Georgia&#x27;s Kmara, Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s KelKel and Belarus&#x27; Zubr. PORA&#x27;s Oleh Kyriyenko said in a 2004 interview with Radio Netherlands,

:&quot;The bible of Pora has been the book of Gene Sharp, also used by Otpor!, it&#x27;s called: From Dictatorship to Democracy. Pora activists have translated it by themselves. We have written to Mr Sharp and to the Albert Einstein Institute in the United States, and he became very sympathetic towards our initiative, and the Institution provided funding to print over 12,000 copies of this book for free.&quot;

Sharp&#x27;s writings on &quot;Civilian-based defense&quot; were used by the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian governments during their separation from the Soviet Union in 1991. Lithuanian Defence Minister Audrius Butkevicius declared at the time, &quot;I would rather have this book than the nuclear bomb&quot;.

The Iranian government charged protesters against alleged fraud in the 2009 elections with following Gene Sharp&#x27;s tactics. The Tehran Times reported: &quot;According to the indictment, a number of the accused confessed that the post-election unrest was preplanned and the plan was following the timetable of the velvet revolution to the extent that over 100 stages of the 198 steps of Gene Sharp were implemented in the foiled velvet revolution.&quot;

Former members of the IRA are reported to be studying his work.

Sharp and his work have been profiled in numerous media; however, some have claimed Sharp&#x27;s influence has been exaggerated by Westerners looking for a Lawrence of Arabia figure.

===Influence in Egypt===
Coverage of Gene Sharp&#x27;s influence in the Egyptian revolution produced a backlash from some Egyptian bloggers. One, journalist Hossam el-Hamalawy, stated that &quot;Not only was Mubarak&#x27;s foreign policy hated and despised by the Egyptian people, but parallels were always drawn between the situation of the Egyptian people and their Palestinian brothers and sisters. The latter have been the major source of inspiration, not Gene Sharp, whose name I first heard in my life only in February after we toppled Mubarak already and whom the clueless &quot;NYT&quot; moronically gives credit for our uprising.&quot; Another Egyptian writer and activist, Karim Alrawi, argued that Gene Sharp&#x27;s writings are more about regime change than revolution. He defines the latter as having an ethical as well as a material dimension that Sharp deliberately avoids engaging with, and credits local circumstances and the spark provided by the Tunisian revolution for the Egyptian success.

However, evidence and testimony from four different activist groups working in Egypt at the time of the revolution contradict these claims. Dalia Ziada, an Egyptian blogger and activist, said that activists translated excerpts of Sharp&#x27;s work into Arabic, and that his message of &quot;attacking weaknesses of dictators&quot; stuck with them. Ahmed Maher, a leader of the April 6 democracy group, also stated in the How to Start a Revolution documentary, &quot;Gene Sharp&#x27;s books had a huge impact&quot; among other influences. The Associated Press reported as early as September 2010 more than four months before the revolution that Gene Sharp&#x27;s work was being used by activists in Egypt close to political leader Mohamed ElBaradei. Finally &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Sharp&#x27;s book &quot;From Dictatorship to Democracy&quot; had been posted by the Muslim Brotherhood on its website during the 2011 Egyptian revolution.

==Criticism==
According to Stuart Bramhall in &quot;Daily Censored&quot;, in 2005 Gene Sharp was accused by Thierry Meyssan in VoltaireNet of having strong links with a variety of US institutions including the Central Intelligence Agency, The Pentagon, International Republican Institute, RAND Corporation, and the National Endowment for Democracy.

There has been debate around Sharp&#x27;s works influencing the Arab Spring, and a leaked US embassy cable mentioned Syrian dissidents using his work to train non-violent protestors, but As&#x27;ad AbuKhalil rejected such claims.

Sharp consistently denied these claims and, after a period of sustained attacks in June 2008, notable left wing writers Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn, among others, defended Sharp in a letter which was circulated by US and internationally based scholars and activists, including the statement,

More recently Sharp has been criticised by George Ciccariello-Maher and Michael A. Lebowitz, the latter describing his activities in Venezuela as &quot;marketing regime change&quot; to willing consumers. Anarchist Peter Gelderloos accuses Sharp of overstating his theory&#x27;s relevance to the 2011 Egyptian revolution for personal aggrandizement. In an interview in &quot;Jacobin&quot;, law graduate and adjunct lecturer Marcie Smith has stated that Sharp&#x27;s theories are &quot;ideologically incoherent&quot; and put &quot;protest movements in a position where they can be easily co-opted&quot; by neoliberal capitalism.

==Works==

<text>Giselle ( , ), originally titled Giselle, ou les Wilis (; &quot;Giselle, or The Wilis&quot;), is a romantic ballet () in two acts with music by Adolphe Adam. Considered a masterwork in the classical ballet performance canon, it was first performed by the Ballet du Th√©√¢tre de l&#x27;Acad√©mie Royale de Musique at the Salle Le Peletier in Paris on 28 June 1841, with Italian ballerina Carlotta Grisi as Giselle. It was an unqualified triumph. It became hugely popular and was staged at once across Europe, Russia, and the United States.

The ghost-filled ballet tells the tragic, romantic story of a beautiful young peasant girl named Giselle and a disguised nobleman named Albrecht, who fall in love, but when his true identity is revealed by his rival, Hilarion, Giselle goes mad and dies of heartbreak. After her death, she is summoned from her grave into the vengeful, deadly sisterhood of the Wilis, the ghosts of unmarried women who died after being betrayed by their lovers and take revenge in the night by dancing men to death by exhaustion (a popular theme in Romantic-era ballets). Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they target Albrecht when he comes to mourn at Giselle&#x27;s grave, but her great love frees him from their grasp. They gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions, creating an ethereal atmosphere that builds as they gradually close in on Albrecht. By saving him from the Wilis, Giselle also saves herself from becoming one of them.

Librettists Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Th√©ophile Gautier took their inspiration for the plot from a prose passage about the Wilis in &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot;, by Heinrich Heine, and from a poem called &quot;Fant√¥mes&quot; in &quot;Les Orientales&quot; by Victor Hugo.

Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot created the original choreography. The role of Giselle was created for Carlotta Grisi as her debut piece for the Paris public, and she was the only ballerina to dance it at the Paris Opera for many years. The traditional choreography that has been passed down to the present day derives primarily from the revivals staged by Marius Petipa during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the Imperial Ballet in Saint Petersburg. One of the world&#x27;s most-often performed classical ballets, it is also one of the most challenging to dance.

== Synopsis ==
=== Act I ===
The ballet opens on a sunny autumnal morning in the Rhineland during the Middle Ages. The grape harvest is in progress. Duke Albrecht of Silesia, a young nobleman, has fallen in love with a shy, beautiful peasant girl named Giselle, despite being engaged to Bathilde, the Duke of Courland&#x27;s daughter. He disguises himself as a humble villager called &quot;Loys&quot; to court the enchanting and innocent Giselle, who knows nothing of his true identity. With the help of his squire, he hides his fine attire, hunting horn, and sword before coaxing her out of her house to romance her as the harvest festivities begin.

Hilarion, a local gamekeeper, is also in love with Giselle and is highly suspicious of the newcomer who has won her affections. He tries to convince her that her beau can not be trusted, but she ignores his warnings. Her mother, Berthe, is very protective of her, as she has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, thinking Hilarion would be a better match, and disapproves of her fondness for dancing, due to the strain on her heart.

A party of noblemen seeking refreshment following the rigors of the hunt arrive in the village with Bathilde among them. Albrecht hurries away, knowing he would be recognized and greeted by her, exposing him as a nobleman. The villagers welcome the party, offer them drinks, and perform several dances. Bathilde is charmed with Giselle&#x27;s sweet and demure nature, not knowing of her relationship with Albrecht. Giselle is honored when Bathilde offers her a necklace as a gift before the group of nobles depart.

The villagers continue the harvest festivities, and Albrecht emerges again to dance with Giselle, who is named the Harvest Queen. Hilarion interrupts the festivities. He has discovered Albrecht&#x27;s finely made sword and presents it as proof that he is really a nobleman who is engaged to another woman. Using Albrecht&#x27;s hunting horn, Hilarion calls back the party of noblemen. Albrecht has no time to hide and has no choice but to greet Bathilde as his fianc√©e. All are shocked by the revelation, but none more than Giselle, who becomes inconsolable when faced with his deception. Knowing that they can never be together, she flies into a mad fit of grief in which all the tender moments she shared with Loys flash before her eyes. She begins to dance wildly and erratically, ultimately causing her weak heart to give out. She collapses and dies in Albrecht&#x27;s arms. Hilarion and Albrecht turn on each other in rage before Albrecht flees the scene in misery. The curtain closes as Berthe weeps over her Giselle&#x27;s body.

In the original version, taken up again recently by a production of the ROB, Giselle stabs herself with Albrecht&#x27;s sword, which explains why her body is laid to rest in the forest, in unhallowed ground, where the Wilis have the power to summon her. Most modern versions are sanitized and have edited out the suicide.

=== Act II ===
Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle&#x27;s forest grave, but is frightened away by the arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. Many were abandoned on their wedding days, and all died of broken hearts. They, led by their merciless queen, Myrtha, dance and haunt the forest at night to exact their revenge on any man they encounter, regardless of who he may be, forcing their victims to dance until they die of exhaustion.

Myrtha and the Wilis rouse Giselle&#x27;s spirit from her grave and induct her into their clan before disappearing into the forest. Albrecht arrives to lay flowers on Giselle&#x27;s grave and he weeps with guilt over her death. Her spirit appears and he begs her forgiveness. She, her love undiminished unlike her vengeful sisters, gently forgives him. She disappears to join the rest of the Wilis and Albrecht desperately follows her.

Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered a terrified Hilarion. They use their magic to force him to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they spy Albrecht, and turn on him, sentencing him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle&#x27;s pleas are also dismissed and he is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle&#x27;s love counters the Wilis&#x27; magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers and will haunt the forest no more. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, she returns to her grave to rest in peace.
== Background ==
The French Revolution (1789‚Äì1799) brought sweeping changes to theatre in France. Banished were the ballets the aristocracy preferred about the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus. Instead, ballets about everyday people, real places, real time, the historical past, and the supernatural took prominence. These sorts of ballets were preferred by the burgeoning middle class.

Two ballets caused great excitement in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer&#x27;s opera &quot;Robert le diable&quot; had its first performance. It featured a short ballet called &quot;Ballet of the Nuns&quot;. In this little ballet, nuns rise from their graves to dance in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural ballet.

In March 1832, the ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot; debuted in Paris. This ballet is about a beautiful sylph who loves James, a young Scotsman. Tragedy occurs. After dallying in the woods, the sylph dies when her earthly lover uses a bewitched scarf to trap her. This ballet brought Marie Taglioni before the French public. She was the first to dance &quot;en pointe&quot; for artistic reasons rather than spectacle and was also the first to wear the white, bell-shaped, calf-length ballet skirt now considered an essential feature of the romantic ballet. Poet and critic Th√©ophile Gautier attended the first performance of &quot;La Sylphide&quot;. His ideas for &quot;Giselle&quot; would show touches of &quot;La Sylphide&quot; ten years later. It would be set in a real place and in the past, for example, and would be about everyday people and supernatural women.

== Development ==
In an 1841 news article announcing the first performance of &quot;Giselle&quot;, Th√©ophile Gautier recorded his part in the creation of the ballet. He had read Heinrich Heine&#x27;s description of the Wilis in &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; and thought these evil spirits would make a &quot;pretty ballet&quot;. He planned their story for act 2 and settled upon a verse by Victor Hugo called &quot;Fant√¥mes&quot; to provide the inspiration for act 1. This verse is about a beautiful 15-year-old Spanish girl who loves to dance. She becomes too warm at a ball and dies of a chill in the cool morning.

Heine&#x27;s prose passage in &quot;De l&#x27;Allemagne&quot; tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves in the middle of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.

Gautier thought Heine&#x27;s Wilis and Hugo&#x27;s fifteen-year-old Spanish girl would make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom glittering with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle&#x27;s heart and the girl would drop dead.

Gautier was not satisfied with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, a man who had written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier&#x27;s basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to L√©on Pillet, the director of the Paris Op√©ra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in &quot;Giselle&quot;. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so &quot;Giselle&quot; was put into production at once.

== First performance ==
The balletomanes of Paris became very excited as the opening night of &quot;Giselle&quot; approached. News reports kept their interest alive. Some reports said that Grisi had had an accident whilst other reports indicated that the conductor was ill with a tumor. Still others said that the stage hands feared for their safety.

Hopes that the ballet would be ready in May were dashed and the opening night was postponed several times. Grisi was absent for a few days and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi&#x27;s role to spare the dancer&#x27;s health. Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of the ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the act 2 finale.

At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 the curtain rose on &quot;Giselle&quot; at the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the gamekeeper Hilarion, and Ad√®le Dumil√¢tre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical practices of the time, &quot;Giselle&quot; was preceded by an excerpt from another production‚Äîin this case, the third act of Rossini&#x27;s opera, &quot;Mos√® in Egitto&quot;. In 1844 Marie Guy-St√©phan made her first appearance in the title role for the first production of &quot;Giselle&quot; in Spain. She performed in numerous works by Pepita.

In spite of the chief machinist shouting orders to his crew that could be heard by the audience, &quot;Giselle&quot; was a great success. Grisi was a sensation. Ballet-goers regarded her as another Marie Taglioni, the greatest ballerina of the period.

== Contemporary reviews and comments ==
&quot;Giselle&quot; was a great artistic and commercial success. &quot;Le Constitutionnel&quot; praised act 2 for its &quot;poetic effects&quot;. &quot;Moniteur des th√©√¢tres&quot; wrote that Grisi &quot;runs [and] flies across the stage like a gazelle in love&quot;. One critic made a detailed analysis of the music in &quot;La France Musicale&quot;. He thought the act 1 waltz &quot;ravishing&quot; and noted that the scene of Berthe&#x27;s was filled with &quot;quite new&quot; harmonic modulations. He praised other moments in Act I (especially the mad scene), and was in raptures with the music of act 2, singling out the entrance of the Wilis and the viola solo played through Giselle&#x27;s last moments. He thought the flute and harp music accompanying Giselle as she disappeared into her grave at ballet&#x27;s end &quot;full of tragic beauty&quot;.

Coralli was praised for the act 1 peasant &quot;pas de deux&quot; and for the &quot;elegance&quot; of act 2. Coralli followed a suggestion made by Gautier and picked the most beautiful girls in the company to play the peasants and the Wilis. One observer thought the selection process cruel: the almost-beautiful girls were turned away without a second thought.

Grisi and Petipa were great successes as the tragic lovers. Gautier praised their performance in act 2, writing that the two dancers made the act &quot;a real poem, a choreographic elegy full of charm and tenderness ... More than one eye that thought it was seeing only [dance] was surprised to find its vision obscured by a tearsomething that does not often happen in a ballet ... Grisi danced with a perfection ... that places her in the ranks between Elssler and Taglioni ... Her miming surpassed every expectation ... She is nature and artlessness personified.&quot;

Adam thought Petipa &quot;charming&quot; as both dancer and actor, and that he had &quot;rehabilitated&quot; male dancing with his performance. Of Dumil√¢tre he wrote, &quot;... in spite of her coldness, [Dumil√¢tre] deserved the success she achieved by the correctness and the &#x27;mythological&#x27; quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, but I can think of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [Dumil√¢tre] seems to bear a strong resemblance to that goddess.&quot;

&quot;Giselle&quot; made 6 500 French francs (equivalent to 37 529 ‚Ç¨ in 2015) between June and September 1841. This was twice the amount for the same time period in 1839. Grisi&#x27;s salary was increased to make her the top earner among the dancers at the Op√©ra. Souvenirs were sold, pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music arrangements were made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her act 2 costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called &quot;fa√ßonn√© Giselle&quot;, and Madame Lainn√©, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called &#x27;Giselle&#x27;. The ballet was parodied at the Th√©√¢tre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.

== Music ==
Adolphe Adam was a popular writer of ballet and opera music in early 19th-century France. He wrote with great speed and completed &quot;Giselle&quot; in about two months. The music was written in the smooth, song-like style of the day called &quot;cantilena&quot;. This style is well known to music lovers from Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;Norma&quot; and Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;.

Adam used several &quot;leitmotifs&quot; in the ballet. This is a short musical phrase that is associated with a certain character, event, or idea. Adam&#x27;s leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion&#x27;s motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony.

Another leitmotif is associated with the &quot;he loves me, he loves me not&quot; flower test in act 1, which is heard again in the mad scene, and in act 2 when Giselle offers flowers to Albrecht. The Wilis have their own motif. It is heard in the overture, in act 1 when Berthe tells the story of the Wilis, and in the mad scene. It is heard again in act 2 when the Wilis make their first entrance. The hunting horn motif marks sudden surprises. This motif is heard when Albrecht is exposed as a nobleman.

The music was completely original. A critic noted, however, that Adam had borrowed eight bars from a romance by a Miss Puget and three bars from the huntsman&#x27;s chorus in Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s opera &quot;Euryanthe&quot;.

One dance historian wrote:

=== Additions to the score ===
Adam&#x27;s score for &quot;Giselle&quot; acquired several additional numbers over the course of its history, with some of these pieces becoming an integral part of the ballet&#x27;s performance tradition.

Immediately following the first &quot;r√©p√©tition g√©n√©rale&quot; of &quot;Giselle&quot; on the stage of the Paris Op√©ra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have a &quot;pas&quot; inserted for herself into the ballet. Coralli quickly arranged the &quot;Pas de deux des jeunes paysans&quot; (&quot;Pas de deux of young peasants&quot;) for Fitz-James and the danseur Auguste Mabille, with music arranged from pieces by the composer Friedrich Burgm√ºller including his &quot;Souvenirs de Ratisbonne&quot; for the &quot;coda&quot;.

For Carlotta Grisi&#x27;s performances as Giselle with the Imperial Ballet in Saint Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni to score a new &quot;pas de cinq&quot; for the ballerina that was added to the first tableau. This &quot;pas&quot; was only retained for Grisi&#x27;s performances and never performed again after her departure from Saint Petersburg.

Marius Petipa commissioned an additional &quot;pas de deux&quot; from the composer Ludwig Minkus for the choreographer&#x27;s 1884 revival of &quot;Giselle&quot; for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova. Minkus based the music for this &quot;pas&quot; on airs taken from Adolphe Adam&#x27;s score for the ballet &quot;Orfa&quot;. 

Three solo variations were added to the ballet by Petipa during the latter half of the 19th century. The first was arranged in 1867 for the &quot;Grand pas de deux&quot; of the second tableau for the ballerina Ad√®le Grantzow. The music was composed by Cesare Pugni and was based on Adolphe Adam&#x27;s &quot;he loves me, he loves me not&quot; leitmotif. This variation has been retained in the ballet ever since.

The second variation was added by Petipa to the first act of the ballet for the ballerina Emma Bessone&#x27;s d√©but as Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre in September of 1887, and for this occasion the composer Riccardo Drigo wrote the music. The music was never used again after Bessone&#x27;s departure from Russia until Agrippina Vaganova added it to the &quot;Peasant pas de deux&quot; for the Kirov Ballet&#x27;s production of &quot;Giselle&quot; in 1932. The inclusion of this variation in the &quot;Peasant pas de deux&quot; remains part of the Mariinsky Theatre&#x27;s performance tradition of &quot;Giselle&quot; to the present day.

The third variation added by Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived as one of the most beloved passages of &quot;Giselle&quot;. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the &quot;Pas seul&quot;, was arranged 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba&#x27;s performance in a revival of Saint-L√©on&#x27;s &quot;Fiametta&quot;. Cornalba then included it for her d√©but in &quot;Giselle&quot; in December of that year, where it has remained ever since. The variation was also danced by many of Cornalba&#x27;s successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba&#x27;s variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Op√©ra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, a misconception which still persists.

== Choreography ==
Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the original version of &quot;Giselle&quot;. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi&#x27;s dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in act 2 for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage hand was brought in to test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.

Cyril Beaumont writes that &quot;Giselle&quot; is made up of two elements: dance and mime. Act 1 features short mimed scenes, he points out, and episodes of dancing which are fused with mime. In act 2, mime has become fused entirely with dance. He indicates that the choreographic vocabulary is composed of a small number of simple steps:

* Movements: &quot;d√©velopp√©, grand rond de jambe&quot;
* Poses: &quot;arabesque, attitude&quot;
* Gliding steps: &quot;chasse, glissade, pas de basque, pas de bourr√©e&quot;
* Hopping steps: &quot;ballon√©, temps lev√©&quot;
* Turning steps: &quot;pirouette, petit tour, tour en l&#x27;air&quot;
* Leaping steps: &quot;(vertical) ballotte, entrechat, sisonne, rond de jambe en l&#x27;air saut√©, (horizontal) cabriole, jet√©, grande jet√©, soubresaut&quot;

Beaumont speculates that the simple steps were deliberately planned to allow the &quot;utmost expressiveness&quot;.

Parts of &quot;Giselle&quot; have been cut or changed since the ballet&#x27;s first night. Giselle&#x27;s act 1 pantomime scene in which she tells Albrecht of her strange dream is cut and the peasant &quot;pas de deux&quot; is also slightly cut back. The Duke of Courland and his daughter Bathilde used to make their entrance on horseback, but today they walk on. In the original production they were present at Giselle&#x27;s death, but now they leave the scene before she dies. The machines used to make Giselle fly and to make her disappear are no longer employed. A trapdoor is sometimes utilized to make Giselle rise from her grave and then sink into it at the end of act 2. At the end of act 2 Bathilde formerly entered with the courtiers to search for Albrecht. He took a few unsteady steps toward them and then collapsed into their arms. This moment was an artistic parallel to the act 1 finale when the peasants gathered about the dead Giselle. Now, Bathilde and the courtiers are cut and Albrecht slowly leaves the stage alone.

== Ethnic elements ==
Ethnic music, dance, and costume were a large part of romantic ballet. At the time &quot;Giselle&quot; was written, people thought of Germany when they heard a waltz because the waltz is of German origin. Giselle makes her first entrance to the music of a waltz, and the audience would have known at once that the ballet was set in Germany. Adam wrote three waltzes for &quot;Giselle&quot;: two for Giselle and one for the Wilis. He said that the &quot;Giselle Waltz&quot; in act 1 has &quot;all the German color indicated by the locality&quot; and people agreed. One critic wrote: &quot;A lovely waltz ... in the Germanic spirit of the subject&quot;.

At first, Gautier thought that some of the dancers in the waltz for the Wilis should dress in ethnic costume and dance ethnic steps. Adam put bits of French, Spanish, German, and Indian-sounding music in the waltz for this purpose. Gautier&#x27;s &quot;ethnic&quot; idea was dropped as the ballet developed and it has not been picked up by modern producers. Today, act 2 is a &quot;ballet blanc&quot; (a &quot;white&quot; ballet in which all the ballerinas and the &quot;corps de ballet&quot; are dressed in full, white, bell-shaped skirts and the dances have a geometric design).

== Sets and costumes ==
The historical period for &quot;Giselle&quot; is not indicated in the story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Op√©ra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It is also possible that Pillet had the ballet&#x27;s budget in mind and decided to use the many Renaissance-style costumes in the Op√©ra&#x27;s wardrobe for &quot;Giselle&quot;. These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; (1829) and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot; (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Op√©ra until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853.

&quot;Giselle&quot; was revived in 1863 with new costumes by Lormier&#x27;s assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert&#x27;s costumes are closer to those of modern productions than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would charge him with a lack of imaginative creativity.

=== Sets ===
Pierre Luc Charles Ciceri was the chief set designer at the Paris Op√©ra from 1815 to 1847. He designed the sets for the first production of &quot;Giselle&quot;. Gautier was not specific about the ballet&#x27;s locale, but placed it in &quot;some mysterious corner of Germany ... on the other side of the Rhine&quot;.

&quot;Giselle&quot; was two months in rehearsal, which was a very long rehearsal time for the period. Even so, Ciceri did not have enough time to design sets for both acts and focused on the second act. The sets for the first act were actually those designed for the 1838 ballet, &quot;La Fille du Danube&quot; by Adam. An illustration from &quot;Les Beaut√©s de l&#x27;Opera&quot; of 1845 shows Giselle&#x27;s cottage with a roof of straw on the left and Albrecht&#x27;s cottage on the right. The two cottages are framed by the branches of two large trees on either sides of the stage. Between the two cottages, in the distance, appears a castle and slopes covered with vineyards. Although this scene was not designed for &quot;Giselle&quot;, it has remained the model for most modern productions. Ciceri&#x27;s set was in use until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853. At that time, Gautier noticed that the sets were falling apart: &quot;Giselle&#x27;s cottage has barely three or four straws on its roof.&quot;

The act 2 illustration from &quot;Les Beaut√©s&quot; shows a dark wood with a pool of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with &#x27;Giselle&#x27; carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.

A circular hole was cut into the backdrop and covered with a transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.

Adam thought Ciceri&#x27;s backdrop for act 1 was &quot;not so good ... it is all weak and pale&quot; but he liked the set for act 2: &quot;[Ciceri&#x27;s] second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect.&quot; The sunrise also delighted the critics.

== Early productions ==
&quot;Giselle&quot; was performed in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849, with Grisi always dancing the title role. In 1849, it was dropped from the repertoire. The ballet was revived in 1852 and 1853, without Grisi, then dropped from the repertoire after 1853. It was revived in 1863 for a Russian ballerina, then dropped again in 1868. It was revived almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva. This production was revived in 1932 and 1938.

&quot;Giselle&quot; was mounted by other ballet companies in Europe and America almost immediately after its first night. The British had their first taste of &quot;Giselle&quot; with a drama based on the ballet called &quot;Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers&quot; by William Moncrieff, who had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler&#x27;s Wells. The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. This production was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi in the role of Albrecht. This production, preceded by an operetta called &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, met with little enthusiasm.

&quot;Giselle&quot; was first performed in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, Saint Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his ballet master Antoine Titus to Paris to find a new ballet for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose &quot;Giselle&quot;. The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in Saint Petersburg. Perrot produced &quot;Giselle&quot; in Saint Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.

&quot;Giselle&quot; was first staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam&#x27;s but that of Niccol√≤ Bajetti. The dances were not the original either but those of Antonio Cortesi. It is possible that the ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres. This, however, is not known with certainty.

In 1844, American ballerina Mary Ann Lee arrived in Paris to study with Coralli for a year. She returned to the United States in 1841 with the directions for &quot;Giselle&quot; and other ballets. Lee was the first to present &quot;Giselle&quot; in the United States. She did this on 1 January 1846 in Boston at the Howard Athen√¶um. George Washington Smith played Albrecht. Lee danced &quot;Giselle&quot; (again with Smith) on 13 April 1846 at the Park Theatre in New York City.

In January 1911 Nijinsky danced in &quot;Giselle&quot; at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg for the Imperial Ballet, with the Tsarina Maria Feodorovna in attendance. His costume, which had been designed by Alexandre Benois and used in Paris before, caused a scandal, as he danced in tights without the then-common trousers. He refused to apologize and was dismissed from the Imperial Ballet.

The ballet was staged by Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes later in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, with Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht. Anna Pavlova danced Giselle with her own company in 1913. Alicia Markova danced the role with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1934, and Margot Fonteyn took the role in 1937 when Markova left the company. The English loved &quot;Giselle&quot;. In 1942, for example, three different companies were dancing the ballet in London.

In a departure from the traditional &quot;Giselle&quot;, Frederic Franklin restaged the ballet in 1984 as &quot;Creole Giselle&quot; for the Dance Theatre of Harlem. This adaptation set the ballet among the Creoles and African Americans in 1840s Louisiana.

A 2012 novel by author Guy Mankowski entitled &quot;Letters from Yelena&quot; follows the journey of a principal dancer as she performs the role of Giselle in Saint Petersburg.

The 2019 South Korean TV series Angel&#x27;s Last Mission: Love features a blind ballerina who is to play the title role of Giselle in a production staged by the Fantasia Ballet Company.

<text>This article lists various tornado records. The most &quot;extreme&quot; tornado in recorded history was the Tri-State tornado, which spread through parts of Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana on March 18, 1925. It is considered an F5 on the Fujita Scale, holds records for longest path length at and longest duration at about hours. The 1974 Guin tornado had the highest forward speed ever recorded in a violent tornado, at . The deadliest tornado in world history was the Daulatpur‚ÄìSaturia tornado in Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, which killed approximately 1,300 people. In the history of Bangladesh, at least 24 tornadoes killed more than 100 people each, almost half of the total for the world. The most extensive tornado outbreak on record was the 2011 Super Outbreak, which resulted in 367 tornadoes and 324 tornadic fatalities, whereas the 1974 Super Outbreak was the most intense tornado outbreak on tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis&#x27;s outbreak intensity score with 578, as opposed to the 2011 outbreak&#x27;s 378.

== Tornado outbreaks ==

=== Most tornadoes in a single 24-hour period ===
The 2011 Super Outbreak was the largest tornado outbreak spawned by a single weather system in recorded history; it produced 367 tornadoes from April 25‚Äì28, with 223 of those in a single 24-hour period on April 27 from midnight to midnight CDT, fifteen of which were violent EF4‚ÄìEF5 tornadoes. 348 deaths occurred in that outbreak, of which 324 were tornado related. The outbreak largely contributed to the record for most tornadoes in the month of April with 780 tornadoes, almost triple the prior record (267 in April 1974). The overall record for a single month was 542 in May 2003, which was also broken.

The infamous 1974 Super Outbreak of April 3‚Äì4, 1974, which spawned 148 confirmed tornadoes across eastern North America, held the record for the most prolific tornado outbreak in terms of overall tornadoes for many years, and still holds the record for most violent, long-track tornadoes (7 F5 and 23 F4 tornadoes). More significant tornadoes occurred within 24¬†hours than any other day on record. Due to a secular trend in tornado reporting, the 2011 and 1974 tornado counts are not directly comparable.

=== Most violent tornadoes (F4/EF4 and F5/EF5) in an outbreak ===
=== Longest continuous outbreak and largest autumnal outbreak ===
Most tornado outbreaks in North America occur in the spring, but there is a secondary peak of tornado activity in the fall. It is historically less consistent from year to year but can include exceptionally large or intense outbreaks. In 1992, an estimated 95 tornadoes broke out in a record 41¬†hours of continuous tornado activity from November 21 to 23. This is also among the largest-known outbreaks in areal expanse. Many other very large outbreaks have occurred in autumn, especially in October and November, such as the 2002 Veterans Day weekend outbreak, in which 83 tornadoes occurred from November 9 to 11, and November 17, 2013, when 73 tornadoes were produced in 11 hours.

=== Greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane ===
The greatest number of tornadoes spawned from a hurricane is 120 from Hurricane Ivan in September 2004, followed by Hurricane Beulah with 115 in September 1967, and 103 from Hurricane Frances in September 2004 (a couple weeks before Ivan). Hurricanes prior to the 1990s, when tornado records were more sparse, perhaps produced more tornadoes than were officially documented.

== Tornadoes annually and monthly ==

=== Most tornadoes for each calendar month ===


=== Most tornadoes in a single year ===
On average, 1,200 tornadoes happen in a year in the United States. The most confirmed tornadoes in a single year was in 2004, which had 1817 confirmed tornadoes. This was mostly boosted by a large tornado outbreak sequence in May 2004, where 509 tornadoes occurred. It also had help from a very active fall and winter tornado season.

== Tornado casualties and damage ==

=== Deadliest single tornado in world history ===
Officially, the deadliest single tornado occurred on April 26, 1989 in Bangladesh, where a large tornado took at least 1,300 lives. In 2022, this tornado&#x27;s death toll was challenged in a database of Bangladeshi tornadoes maintained by Dr. Fahim Sufi with the Australian Government, claiming that the April 14, 1969, Dhaka tornado, which killed 922 people, was the deadliest in Bangladesh, with the Jamalpur tornado killing only 570.

=== Deadliest single tornado in US history ===
The Tri-State tornado of March 18, 1925, killed 695¬†people in Missouri (11), Illinois (613), and Indiana (71). The outbreak it occurred with was also the deadliest known tornado outbreak, with a combined death toll of 747 across the Mississippi River Valley.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOAA/NWS 1925 Tri-State Tornado Statistics&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Most intense tornado damage ===
The original Fujita scale, developed by Ted Fujita, has never been used to assign a final rating over F5 intensity; however, two tornadoes, the 1970 Lubbock tornado and 1974 Xenia tornado, were initially given F6 ratings by Fujita himself, but both were eventually downgraded to F5 ratings. The 1976 Jordan tornado was described by Fujita as the most intense tornado damage he had surveyed up to that point.

A more recent example of extreme damage was at the Double Creek Estates of Jarrell, Texas; the 1997 Jarrell tornado stalled over the area at peak F5 intensity, destroying every home in the subdivision, and killing 27. Extreme ground scouring and high-end F5 damage was surveyed. The 2008 Parkersburg tornado was reported by mayor Bob Haylock to have been so intense that a majority of the fatalities out of Parkersburg were from people taking shelter in basements underground. The 2011 Philadelphia, Mississippi tornado caused extreme ground scouring across its path; up to of soil was removed from the environment, presumably from intense subvortices.

=== Most damaging tornado ===
The 1896 St. Louis‚ÄìEast St. Louis tornado on May 27, incurred the most damages adjusted for inflation, with an estimated $5.36 billion (2022 USD). In raw numbers, the Joplin tornado of May 22, 2011, is considered the costliest tornado in recent history, with damage totals at $3.71 billion (2022 USD). Until April 2011, the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado of May 3, 1999, was the most costly, which was later surpassed by the 2011 Tuscaloosa‚ÄìBirmingham tornado, with a damage total of $3.18 billion (2022 USD).

During the F5 1999 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado on May 3, 1999, in the southern Oklahoma City metro area, a Doppler on Wheels situated near the tornado measured winds of momentarily in a small area inside the funnel approximately above ground level. The measured winds in this tornado have been updated to 

On May 31, 2013, a tornado hit rural areas near El Reno, Oklahoma. The tornado was originally rated as an EF3 based on damage; however, after mobile radar data analysis was conducted, it was concluded to have been an EF5 due to a measured wind speed of greater than , second only to the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado. Revised RaXPol analysis found winds of well above ground level and ‚â• below with some subvortices moving at . These winds may possibly be as high or higher than the winds recorded on May¬†3, 1999. Despite the recorded windspeed, the El Reno tornado was later downgraded back to EF3 due to the fact that no EF5 damage was found, likely due to the lack of sufficient damage indicators in the largely-rural area west of Oklahoma City.

During the Greenfield, Iowa EF4 on May 21, 2024, Doppler on Wheels recorded wind speeds of in a very small swath inside the funnel approximately above radar level as the tornado went through town. After doing some mathematical and physics-based calculations, the researchers determined those measured winds were equivalent to . The calculated minimum wind threshold as stated beats both the 1999 Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado and the 2013 El Reno, Oklahoma tornado for minimum possible maximum windspeed; however, the highest confirmed peak windspeeds are lower than the 1999 tornado.

Winds were measured at using portable Doppler weather radar in the Red Rock, Oklahoma, tornado during the April 26, 1991, tornado outbreak in north-central Oklahoma. Though these winds are possibly indicative of F5 intensity, this particular tornado&#x27;s path never encountered any significant structures and caused minimal damage, so it was rated F4.

While never observed, these tornadoes are believed to have had winds of or above, which would make them among the strongest tornadoes in history. There is a questionable analysis of the 1917 Mattoon/Charleston tornado published in the &quot;Geographical Review&quot; in 1917 that stated the tornado had strong &quot;inflowing wind, which probably exceeded &quot;. A 1968 Weather Bureau review of the 1968 Hansell-Charles City tornado found intense ground scouring, and initial estimates for wind speeds reached ; these figures were revised down to .

=== Longest damage path and duration ===
 The longest-known track for a single tornado is the Tri-State tornado, occurring on March 18, 1925, with a path length of . For years there was debate whether the originally-recognized path length of over 3.5 hours was from one tornado or a series. Some very long track (VLT) tornadoes were later determined to be successive tornadoes spawned by the same supercell thunderstorm, which are known as a tornado family. The Tri-State tornado, however, appeared to have no gaps in the damage. A six-year reanalysis study by a team of severe convective storm meteorologists found insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions but does conclude that it is likely that the beginning and ending of the path was resultant of separate tornadoes comprising a tornado family. It also found that the tornado began to the west and ended farther east than previously known, bringing the total path to . The segment from central Madison County, Missouri, to Pike County, Indiana, is likely one continuous tornado, and the segment from central Bollinger County, Missouri, to western Pike County, Indiana, is very likely a single continuous tornado. Another significant tornado was found about east-northeast of the end of aforementioned segment(s) of the Tri-State tornado family and is likely another member of the family. Its path length of over about 20 minutes makes the known tornado family path length total to over about hours. Grazulis in 2001 wrote that the first of the (originally recognized) track is probably the result of two or more tornadoes and that a path length of was seemingly continuous.

The 2021 Western Kentucky tornado on December 10, 2021 is the longest confirmed track of a tornado. This violent tornado tracked through the states of Tennessee and Kentucky during a very intense late-season outbreak. The tornado was spawned by a very long-tracked supercell that previously dropped another violent tornado in Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee, and initial media reports referred to the entire event as the &quot;Quad-state Tornado&quot;, which would have had a path of .

On March 22, 1953, a tornado touched down near Leesville, Louisiana at 21:00 UTC; the tornado continued into far-northwest Mississippi, before dissipating north of Leland, killing two and injuring 22. The tornado was rated F2 on the Fujita scale. It traveled for , making it possibly the longest tracked tornado in history, though it is likely that the path consisted of multiple different tornadoes as part of a tornado family.

=== Longest path and duration tornado family ===
What at one time was thought to be the record holder for the longest tornado path is now thought to be the longest tornado family, with a track of at least on May 26, 1917, from the Missouri border across Illinois into Indiana. It caused severe damage and mass casualties in Charleston and Mattoon, Illinois.

What was probably the longest track supercell thunderstorm tracked across 6 states in 17.5¬†hours on March 12, 2006, as part of the March 2006 tornado outbreak sequence. It began in Noble County, Oklahoma, and ended in Jackson County, Michigan, producing many tornadoes in Missouri and Illinois.

=== Largest path width ===

Officially, the widest tornado on record is the El Reno, Oklahoma tornado of May 31, 2013, with a width of at its peak. This is the width found by the National Weather Service based on preliminary data from University of Oklahoma RaXPol mobile radar that also sampled winds of , which was used to upgrade the tornado to EF5. However, it was revealed that these winds did not impact any structures, and as a result the tornado was downgraded to EF3 based on damage.

The F4 Hallam, Nebraska, tornado during the outbreak of May 22, 2004, was the previous official record holder for the widest tornado, surveyed at wide. A similar size tornado struck Edmonson, Texas on May 31, 1968, when a damage path width between was recorded from an F3 tornado. Another tornado with a similar width struck Maxton and Red Springs during the March 28, 1984, Carolina Tornado Outbreak; this tornado had a width of 2.5 miles wide at one point. Rated as F4, the tornado resulted in 3 fatalities and 280 injuries. The EF4 Jiangsu tornado on June 23, 2016, also had a peak width of 4.1¬†km wide (2.5 miles).

On May 3, 1999, a Doppler On Wheels (DOW) mobile radar observed an F4 tornado as it crossed Mulhall during the 1999 Oklahoma Tornado Outbreak, which also produced the Bridge Creek‚ÄìMoore tornado. The DOW documented the largest-ever-observed core flow circulation with a distance of between peak velocities on either side of the tornado, and a roughly width of peak wind gusts exceeding , making the Mulhall tornado the largest tornado ever measured quantitatively.

On April 21, 1946, a tornado struck the area in and around Timber Lake, South Dakota. The U.S. Weather Bureau published a paper in 1946 stating the width of this tornado was , which would make this the widest tornado ever documented in history. However, this is outside the period of reliable documentation accepted by the National Weather Service, which is 1950‚Äìpresent.

On May 19, 2024, a large multiple-vortex tornado tracked over rural areas near Custer City, Oklahoma. While the tornado is believed to only have been about 1 mile wide, the maximum width of its tornadic windfield and accompanying damage was nearly , making it one of the largest recorded damage paths of any tornado.

=== Smallest and shortest-lived damaging tornado ===
The smallest and shortest-lived tornado on record to produce surveyable damage was an EF1 tornado on the western side of Broken Bow, Nebraska on July 16, 2024. Spawned from an outflow-driven supercell, a very brief tornado, seen by a chaser and a surveillance camera, was recorded on the ground for only two seconds, having a listed maximum width of only and a listed path length of . Despite this, it was powerful enough to lift and throw a trailer into a nearby parked car.

=== Highest forward speed ===

The highest accepted forward speed of an intense tornado on record was from the 1974 Guin tornado that tore across northwestern Alabama. Other weak tornadoes have approached or exceeded this speed, but this is the fastest forward movement observed in a major tornado. The 1977 Birmingham tornado had an average forward speed of , as did the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado.

Weaker tornadoes and tornadovortices have been recorded exceeding these speeds. Subvortices of the 2013 El Reno tornado were recorded to travel at speeds of as they orbited the main vortex; the fastest speed a separate tornado-producing mesocyclone has been recorded to travel at was determined via photogrammetry to be the junior EF4 of the 2014 Pilger, Nebraska, tornado family, travelling at for five seconds near the very end of its lifespan. These figures have not been acknowledged by the National Weather Service.

Calculations of highest speeds from the National Centers for Environmental Information Storm Events Database gives a high average forward speed of a significant tornado just west of Galt, Iowa, on December 15, 2021, of between and . This tornado occurred during the December 2021 Midwest derecho and tornado outbreak, and was accompanied by straight-line winds approaching . A faster range can be calculated on an EF1 tornado south of Taylorville, Illinois on March 31, 2023, which traveled between 18:13 and 18:14, giving a range of forward speeds between and . Due to significant variability caused by the unspecific nature of the timestamps provided, these speed figures are unofficial.

=== Greatest pressure drop ===
A pressure deficit of was observed when a violent tornado near Manchester, South Dakota on June 24, 2003, passed directly over an in-situ probe deployed by storm chasing researcher Tim Samaras. In less than a minute, the pressure dropped to , which are the greatest pressure decline and the lowest pressure ever recorded at the Earth&#x27;s surface when adjusted to sea level.

On April 21, 2007, a pressure deficit was reported when a tornado struck a storm chasing vehicle in Tulia, Texas. The tornado caused EF2 damage as it passed through Tulia. The reported pressure drop far exceeds that which would be expected based on theoretical calculations.

There is a questionable and unofficial citizen&#x27;s barometer measurement of a drop around Minneapolis in 1904.

== Early tornadoes ==

=== Earliest-known tornado in Europe ===
* The earliest recorded tornado in Europe struck Freising (Germany) in 788.
* The earliest-known Irish tornado appeared on April 30, 1054, in Rostella, near Kilbeggan. The earliest-known British tornado hit central London on October 23, 1091, and was especially destructive.

=== Earliest-known tornado in the Americas ===
* An apparent tornado is recorded to have struck Tlatelolco (present day Mexico City), on August 21, 1521, two days before the Aztec capital&#x27;s fall to Cort√©s. Many other tornadoes are documented historically within the Basin of Mexico.

==== First confirmed tornado and first tornado fatality in present-day United States ====
* August 1671 ‚Äì Rehoboth, Massachusetts
* July 8, 1680 ‚Äì Cambridge, Massachusetts ‚Äì 1 death

=== Earliest-known tornado in Asia ===
* An apparent tornado caused severe damage in Heian-ky≈ç in modern-day Kyoto on 1 June 1180, which was recorded by Japanese author Kamo no Ch≈çmei, who personally experienced the tornado.
* The earliest recorded tornado in continental Asia struck near the city of Calcutta in present-day West Bengal, India, in 1838. It was described as moving remarkably slow across its path southeast over the span of 2 to 3 hours. It was recorded to cause significant damage to the area, including hail being observed at the Dum Dum weather observatory.

=== First published scientific studies of a tornado ===
A few scientists in Europe, the US, and elsewhere documented the occurrence of tornadoes in the late 18th and early-mid 19th centuries to try to discern patterns of distribution and sometimes with inferences about formative processes and dynamics.

For intensive studies of tornadoes, these are the earliest known publications:

* 1765: German scientist Gottlob Burchard Genzmer published a detailed survey of the damage path of an extremely violent tornado which occurred near Woldegk, Germany, on 29 June 1764. It covers the entire 33¬†km (18.6¬†mi) long track and also includes eyewitness reports as well as an analysis of the debris and hail fallout areas. Genzmer calls the event an &quot;Orcan&quot; and only compares it to waterspouts or dust devils. Based on the damage survey, modern day meteorologists from the ESSL gave an roughly estimated rating of F5.
* 1839‚Äì41: A detailed survey of the damage path of the significant tornado that struck New Brunswick, New Jersey, on 19 June 1835, was published. This tornado is also considered the deadliest tornado in New Jersey history. The path was surveyed by many scientists on account of its location between New York City and Philadelphia, including early tornado theorists James Pollard Espy and William Charles Redfield. Scientists disagreed whether there was whirling, convergent, or rotational motion. A conclusion that remains accurate today is that the most intense damage tends to be on the right side of a tornado (with respect to direction of forward movement), which was found to be generally easterly.
* 1840: The earliest known intensive study of a tornadic event published in Europe, by French scientist Athanase Peltier.
* 1865: The first in India and earliest known scientific survey of a tornado that analyzed structure and dynamics was published in 1865 by Indian scientist Chunder Sikur Chatterjee. The path damage survey of a tornado that occurred at Pundooah (now Pandua), Hugli district, West Bengal, India, was documented on maps and revealed multiple vortices, the tornadocyclone, and direction of rotation, predating work by John Park Finley, Alfred Wegener, Johannes Letzmann, and Ted Fujita.
== Exceptional tornado droughts ==
=== Longest span without a tornado rated F5/EF5 in the United States ===
Before the Greensburg EF5 tornado on May 4, 2007, it had been eight years and one day since the United States had a confirmed F5/EF5 tornado. Prior to Greensburg, the last confirmed F5/EF5 had hit the southern Oklahoma City metro area and surrounding communities on May 3, 1999. This stretch was later surpassed by an ongoing drought which began on May 20, 2013; it is now the longest interval without an F5/EF5 tornado since official records began in 1950.

=== Years without tornado rated violent (F4/EF4+) in United States ===
2018 was the only year since official records began in 1950 that no tornado in the United States was rated in the violent class (F4/EF4+).

== Exceptional survivors ==

=== Longest distance carried by a tornado ===
Matt Suter of Fordland, Missouri holds the record for the longest-known distance traveled by anyone picked up by a tornado who survived the ordeal. On March 12, 2006, he was carried , shy of , according to National Weather Service measurements.

While not officially reported as the longest distance, both the National Weather Service and tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis document that the 1976 Brownwood, Texas, F5 tornado picked up and threw two teenagers , with both surviving.

==Exceptional coincidences==
===Arabi, Louisiana===
On March 22, 2022, an EF3 tornado struck Arabi, Louisiana, a census-designated place in the New Orleans metropolitan area. On December 14 of that year, another tornado, rated EF2, affected many of the same areas, with the two tornado tracks overlapping in parts of Terrytown and Arabi.

===Barnsley, Kentucky===
The unincorporated community of Barnsley, Kentucky was hit twice by intense tornadoes less than three years apart from each other.

The violent 2021 Western Kentucky tornado hit the community, destroying numerous homes, and in 2024, the city was struck again by an EF3 tornado that impacted many of the same areas. Certain areas in Barnsley were affected by both tornadoes.

===Chaffee, Kelso and Illmo, Missouri===
On April 30, 1940, two separate tornadoes, less than two hours apart, struck the communities of Chaffee, Kelso and Illmo, Missouri. Thomas P. Grazulis rated both tornadoes F2 on the Fujita scale and both tornadoes killed one person near Kelso.

===Chicago, Illinois===
Chicago is the largest city in the state of Illinois and the third most populated in the United States, and had only seen six tornadoes between 1954 and 2023. However, on July 14 and 15, 2024, back-to-back outbreaks of weak (EF0 and EF1) tornadoes produced six within the city limits in a span of under 48 hours. The July 15 event, prompted by a derecho, spawned 32 tornadoes in the National Weather Service Chicago, Illinois area of responsibility, tying the one-year record of 32 in a single day. The forecast area typically only sees 15 tornadoes per year.

===Codell, Kansas===
The small town of Codell, Kansas, was hit by a tornado on the same date (May 20) three consecutive years: 1916, 1917, and 1918. The United States has about 100,000 thunderstorms per year; less than 1% produce a tornado. The odds of this coincidence occurring again are extremely small.

===Dolores, Uruguay===
The small town of Dolores, Uruguay, has been hit multiple times by intense tornadoes.

On November 25, 1985, the city was hit by an intense tornado rated as an F3. On December 8, 2012, 27 years later, another intense tornado occurred in the outskirts of the city. On April 15, 2016, an EF3 tornado destroyed large portions of the city.

===La Plata, Maryland===
La Plata is a town in Charles County, Maryland, located well outside the climatologically favored area for tornadoes, let alone violent ones. Despite that, it has been struck several times.

On November 9, 1926, it was struck by a high-end F3 to F4 tornado that killed 13 school children, 4 townspeople, and injured some 65 others.

67 years later on July 27, 1994, it was struck again by two nonfatal twisters that came only 11 minutes apart. The first of them was rated F2, which is already uncommon for that greater area.

On April 28, 2002, La Plata was struck by another violent and extremely fast-moving F4 tornado that initially received a preliminary rating of F5, making it, for a brief period, the easternmost F5 tornado in the United States. Not only that, but shortly before the F4 passed through downtown La Plata, eyewitness accounts indicated that a second F2 tornado formed a quarter of a mile south of the primary one. Between 7:02 and 7:07¬†p.m., both tornadoes crossed through the heart of La Plata, devastating the town.

The most recent tornado to have struck the town was an EF1 on February 25th, 2017.

===Moore, Oklahoma===
The southern Oklahoma City suburb of Moore, Oklahoma, was hit by violent tornadoes (which have ratings of at least F/EF4) in 1999, 2003, 2010, and 2013. The 1999 and 2013 events were rated F5 and EF5, respectively.

In total, about 23 tornadoes have struck within the immediate vicinity of Moore since 1890, the most recent of which was an EF2 tornado on March 25, 2015.

===Shreveport, Louisiana===
A lesser-known hotspot for tornadic activity is Shreveport and its neighbouring town, Bossier City, Louisiana.

Downtown Shreveport has been hit multiple times by powerful tornadoes, including once in February 1912 (rated F3), April 1964 (rated F3), April 1978 (rated F2), December 1978 (rated F4), April 2000 (rated F1), April 2009 (rated EF2), October 2009 (rated EF2), and April 2018 (rated EF1).

===Tanner/Harvest, Alabama===
Tanner, a small town in northern Alabama, was hit by an F5 tornado on April 3, 1974 and was struck again 45 minutes later by a second F5 (however, the rating is disputed and it may have been high-end F4), demolishing what remained of the town.

Thirty-seven years later, on April 27, 2011 (the largest and deadliest outbreak since 1974), Tanner was hit yet again by the EF5 2011 Hackleburg‚ÄìPhil Campbell tornado, which produced high-end EF4 damage in the southern portion of town.

The suburban community of Harvest, Alabama, just to the northeast, also sustained major impacts from all three Tanner tornadoes, and was also hit by destructive tornadoes in 1995 and 2012.

=== Tinker Air Force Base, OK ===

On March 20, 1948, an unpredicted line of storms hit the area, producing an F-3 tornado that hit areas of south Oklahoma City, hitting Tinker Air Force Base at the end of its life, damaging many aircraft. This caused a 3-day investigation at the base on why it was so poorly forecasted.

On March 25, meteorologists noted that conditions were very similar to March 20 and issued a forecast for thunderstorms. As the day wore on and conditions became more favorable (with a developing squall line detected on radar), meteorologists Ernest J. Fawbush and Robert C. Miller issued the first ever official tornado forecast. That night, another F-3 tornado struck the base, though was less damaging thanks to the advance warning. This was the first successful tornado forecast in history, even though much of it was due to chance.

<text>The Solomons Baptist Association is a Baptist Christian denomination affiliated with and cooperating in the American Baptist Association.

==History==
Neil Morley, a missionary sent by Antioch Missionary Baptist Church of Lynwood, California, entered the Solomon Islands in 1969. At that time the country was a protectorate of Great Britain, but gained its independence in 1978. This area consists of 10 larger islands and 4 groups of smaller islands. The native peoples of the Solomons are Melanesian.

From its beginning in 1969 until 2002, the work of the &quot;American Baptist Association&quot; in the Solomons had grown to 56 churches, consisting of one congregation on Bellona, eight congregations on Guadalcanal, 42 congregations on Malaita, three congregations on Rennell, one congregation on Russell, and one congregation in Western Province. &quot;Solomons Baptist Association&quot; represents about 95% of the Baptist work existing on the &quot;Solomon Islands&quot;, which in turn makes up about 10% of the mostly Christian religions in the country. The work is largely self-supporting, with the churches being pastored by native Solomon Islanders.

The faith and practice of the churches of the &quot;Solomons Baptist Association&quot; is the same as other churches of the &quot;American Baptist Association&quot;, which can be described as conservative, evangelical, and landmark.

<doc id="454085" wikidata="Q1478776" url="?curid=454085" title="Truthmaker theory">
<text>Truthmaker theory is &quot;the branch of metaphysics that explores the relationships between what is true and what exists&quot;. The basic intuition behind truthmaker theory is that truth depends on being. For example, a perceptual experience of a green tree may be said to be true because there actually is a green tree. But if there were no tree there, it would be false. So the experience by itself does not ensure its truth or falsehood, it depends on something else. Expressed more generally, truthmaker theory is the thesis that &quot;the truth of truthbearers depends on the existence of truthmakers&quot;. A perceptual experience is the &quot;truthbearer&quot; in the example above. Various representational entities, like beliefs, thoughts or assertions can act as truthbearers. Truthmaker theorists are divided about what type of entity plays the role of &quot;truthmaker&quot;; popular candidates include states of affairs and tropes.

&quot;Truthmaker maximalism&quot; is the thesis that every truth has a truthmaker. An alternative view is &quot;truthmaker atomism&quot;, the thesis that only atomic sentences have truthmakers. Truthmaker atomism remains true to the basic intuition that truth depends on being by holding that the truth of molecular sentences depends on the truth of atomic sentences, whose truth in turn depends on being.

All non-maximalist positions accept that there are &quot;truthmaker gaps&quot;: truths without truthmakers. Opponents have tried to disprove truthmaker theory by showing that there are so-called &quot;deep truthmaker gaps&quot;: truthbearers that not only lack a truthmaker but whose truths do not even depend on being. Various principles governing the truthmaking relation have been proposed in order to make the intuitions about the role and nature of truthmaking explicit. Truthmaker theory is closely related to the &quot;correspondence theory of truth&quot;, but not identical to it. Truthmaker theory has been applied to various fields in metaphysics, often with the goal of exposing &quot;ontological cheaters&quot;: theorists who are committed to certain beliefs but do not or cannot account for the existence of a truthmaker for these beliefs.

==Overview==

In &quot;Truth-Makers&quot; (1984), Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons and Barry Smith introduced the truth-maker idea as a contribution to the correspondence theory of truth. Logically atomic empirical sentences such as &quot;John kissed Mary&quot; have truthmakers, typically events or tropes corresponding to the main verbs of the sentences in question. Mulligan et al. explore extensions of this idea to sentences of other sorts, but they do not embrace any position of truthmaker maximalism, according to which every truthbearer has a truthmaker.

This maximalist position leads to philosophical difficulties, such as the question of what the truthmaker for an ethical, modal or mathematical truthbearer could be. Someone who is deeply enough committed to truthmakers and who simultaneously doubts that a truthmaker could be found for a certain kind of truthbearer will simply deny that that truthbearer could be true. Those who find the Parmenidean insight sufficiently compelling often take it to be a particularly enlightening metaphysical pursuit to search for truthmakers of these kinds of propositions.

Another difficulty for the claim that every truthbearer has a truthmaker is with negations of existential propositions (or, equivalently, universal propositions). In the example of asking if unicorns exist, proposals include the &quot;totality&quot; of all things, or some worldly state of affairs such as x1&#x27;s not being a unicorn, x2&#x27;s not being a unicorn, ..., and everything&#x27;s being x1, or x2, or ... (the latter suggestion is due to Richard M. Gale).

David Lewis has proposed a more moderate version of the truthmaker theory on which truthmakers are only required for positive propositions (e.g., there must be a truthmaker for the proposition that there are horses, but not for the equally true proposition that there are no unicorns). What makes a negative proposition &quot;p&quot; true is the &quot;lack&quot; of a falsemaker for it, i.e., the lack of a truthmaker for the negation of &quot;p&quot;. Thus what makes it true that there are no unicorns is the lack of a truthmaker for the proposition that there &quot;are&quot; unicorns, i.e., the lack of unicorns.

Truthmaker theorists differ as to what entities are the truthmakers of various truthbearers. Some say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting (assuming he is) is &quot;Socrates&#x27; being seated&quot; (whatever exactly that might turn out to be on the correct ontology) and in general the truthmaker of the truthbearer expressed by a sentence &quot;s&quot; can be denoted by the participial nominalization of &quot;s&quot;. Others will say that the truthmaker of the proposition that Socrates is sitting is just &quot;Socrates&quot; himself. In any case, the truthmaker is supposed to be something &quot;concrete&quot;, and on the first view is that whose existence is reported by the truthbearer and on the second view is that which the truthbearer is &quot;about&quot;.

While the existence of truthmakers may seem an abstruse question, concrete instances are at the heart of a number of philosophical issues. Thus, J. L. Mackie has argued that the truthmakers of moral claims would be &quot;queer entities&quot;, too strange to exist, and hence all moral claims are false. Alternatively, a divine command metaethicist may insist that the only possible candidate for a truthmaker of a moral claim is a command from a perfect God, and hence if moral claims are true and a truthmaker theory holds, then God exists. Thus the disagreement between various metaethical schools is in part a disagreement over what kinds of truthmakers moral claims would have if these claims were true and over whether such truthmakers exist.

==Truthmaker gaps==
A truthmaker gap is a truth that lacks a truthmaker. Truthmaker maximalists hold that there are no truthmaker gaps: every truth has a truthmaker. Truthmaker non-maximalists, on the other hand, allow that some truths lack a truthmaker. Truthmaker non-maximalists still count as truthmaker theorists in the sense that they hold onto the core intuition of truthmaker theory that truth depends on being.

Atomic truthmaker theories, which have their root in logical atomism, are examples of such a position. According to them, only atomic sentences have truthmakers. A sentence is atomic or simple if it does not have other sentences as proper parts. For example, &quot;The sun is shining&quot; is an atomic sentence while &quot;The sun is shining and the wind is blowing&quot; is a non-atomic or molecular sentence since it is made up of two sentences linked by the conjunction &quot;and&quot;. In propositional calculus molecular sentences are composed through truth-functional logical connectives. Molecular sentences lack truthmakers according to atomic truthmaker theories and therefore constitute truthmaker gaps. But the fact that the truth values of molecular sentences depends on the truth values of its constituents (if only truth-functional connectives are allowed) ensures that truth still depends on being.

This type of truthmaker gap has been called a &quot;shallow&quot; truthmaker gap. Shallow truthmaker gaps are contrasted with &quot;deep&quot; truthmaker gaps. Deep truthmaker gaps are truths that do not depend on being. They therefore pose a challenge to any type of truthmaker theory. In terms of possible worlds, a deep truthmaker gap is a proposition that is true in one possible world and false in another where there is no difference between these two worlds beside the truth value of this proposition. Critics of truthmaker theory have tried to find deep truthmaker gaps in order to refute truthmaker theory in general.

==Truthmaking principles==
Various principles governing the truthmaking relation have been proposed. They aim to make our intuitions about the role and nature of truthmaking explicit.

The &quot;entailment principle&quot; states that if entity &quot;e&quot; is a truthmaker for proposition &quot;p&quot; and &quot;p&quot; entails proposition &quot;q&quot; then &quot;e&quot; is also a truthmaker for &quot;q&quot;.

The &quot;conjunction principle&quot; states that if entity &quot;e&quot; is a truthmaker for the conjunction of proposition &quot;p&quot; and proposition &quot;q&quot; then &quot;e&quot; is also a truthmaker for &quot;p&quot;.

The &quot;disjunction principle&quot; states that if entity &quot;e&quot; is a truthmaker for the disjunction of proposition &quot;p&quot; and proposition &quot;q&quot; then &quot;e&quot; is either a truthmaker of &quot;p&quot; or a truthmaker of &quot;q&quot;.

These principles seem intuitively to be true but it has been shown that they lead to implausible conclusions when combined with other plausible principles.

== Relation to the correspondence theory of truth ==
The correspondence theory of truth states that &quot;truth&quot; consists in &quot;correspondence&quot; with &quot;reality&quot;. Or in the words of Thomas Aquinas: &quot;A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality&quot;. Truthmaker theory is closely related to correspondence theory; some authors see it as a modern version of correspondence theory. The similarity between the two can be seen in the following example definitions:

*&quot;Correspondence theory&quot;: David&#x27;s belief that the sky is blue is true if and only if this belief stands in a correspondence-relation to the fact that the sky is blue.
*&quot;Truthmaker theory&quot;: David&#x27;s belief that the sky is blue is true if and only if this belief stands in a truthmaking-relation to the fact that the sky is blue.

But despite the obvious similarities there are a few important differences between truthmaker theory and correspondence theory. For one, correspondence theory aims to give a &quot;substantive account&quot; or a &quot;definition&quot; of what truth is. Truthmaker theory, on the other hand, has the goal of &quot;determining&quot; how truth depends on being. So it presupposes the notion of truth instead of defining it. While it seems natural to combine truthmaker theory with a correspondence-conception of truth, this is not necessary. Another difference between the two theories is that correspondence is a symmetric relation while the truthmaking relation is &quot;asymmetric&quot;.

==Applications==
Arguments based on truthmaker theory have been used in various fields to criticize so-called &quot;ontological cheaters&quot;. An &quot;ontological cheater&quot; is someone who is committed to a certain belief but does not or cannot account for the existence of a truthmaker for this belief. If such a belief was true then its truth would be brute or free-floating: it would be disconnected from any underlying reality. This is opposed to the basic intuition behind truthmaker theory that truth depends on being.

Defense strategies open to theorists accused of ontological cheating include denying that the proposition in question is true, denying the legitimacy of truthmaker theory as a whole or finding a so-called &quot;proxy&quot; or &quot;trace&quot; within their preferred ontology. A proxy or trace, in this context, is an entity that can act as a truthmaker for the proposition in question even though it is not obvious that this proposition is about this entity. An example of such a strategy in actualism is to use actual but abstract objects as proxies for propositions about possible objects, whose existence is denied by actualism.

===Presentism===
One such criticism has been leveled against presentism. Presentism is the view that only the present exists, i.e. that past entities or events lack existence. Eternalism is the opposite of presentism. It holds that past, present and future existents are equally real. Beliefs about the past and the future are very common, for example the belief that dinosaurs existed. Providing a truthmaker for this belief is quite straightforward for eternalists: they may claim that the dinosaurs themselves or facts about dinosaurs act as truthmakers. This is unproblematic since, for eternalists, past entities have regular existence. This strategy is not available to the presentists since they deny that past entities have existence. But there seem to be no obvious truthmaker candidates for this belief among the present entities. The presentist would have to be labeled an &quot;ontological cheater&quot; unless he can find a truthmaker within his ontology.

===Phenomenalism===
Phenomenalism has been subjected to a similar criticism. Phenomenalism is the view that only phenomena exist. It is opposed to the common sense intuition that the material objects we perceive exist independently of our perceptual experiences of them and that they even exist when not perceived. This includes for example the belief that valuables locked inside a safe do not cease to exist despite the fact that no one observes them in there, which would, of course, defeat the purpose of locking them inside in the first place. The phenomenalist faces the problem of how to account for the truth of this belief. A well-known solution to this problem comes from John Stuart Mill. He claimed that we can account for unperceived objects in terms of counterfactual conditionals: It is true that the valuables are in the safe because if someone looked inside then this person would have a corresponding sensory impression. But this solution does not satisfy the truthmaker theorist since it still leaves open what the truthmaker for this counterfactual conditional is. It is not clear how such a truthmaker could be found within the phenomenalist ontology.

===Actualism===
Actualism is the view that everything there is, is actual, i.e. that only actual things have existence. &quot;Actualism&quot; contrasts with &quot;possibilism&quot;, the view that there are some entities that are merely possible. Actualists face the problem of how to account for the truthmakers of modal truths, like &quot;it was possible for the Cuban Missile Crisis to escalate into a full-scale nuclear war&quot;, &quot;there could have been purple cows&quot; or &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot;. Actualists have proposed various solutions, but there is no consensus as to which one is the best solution.

A well-known account relies on the notion of possible worlds, conceived as actual abstract objects, for example as maximal consistent sets of propositions or of states of affairs. A set of propositions is maximal if, for any statement &quot;p&quot;, either &quot;p&quot; or &quot;not-p&quot; is a member. Possible worlds act as truthmakers for modal truths. For example, there is a possible world which is inhabited by purple cows. This world is a truthmaker for &quot;there could have been purple cows&quot;. Cows are animals in all possible worlds that are inhabited by cows. So all worlds are the truthmaker of &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot;. This account relies heavily on a logical notion of modality, since possibility and necessity are defined in terms of consistency. This dependency has prompted some philosophers to assert that no truthmakers at all are needed for modal truths, that modal truths are true &quot;by default&quot;. This position involves abandoning truthmaker maximalism.

An alternative solution to the problem of truthmakers for modal truths is based on the notion of &quot;essence&quot;. Objects have their properties either essentially or accidentally. The essence of an object involves all the properties it has essentially. The essence of a thing defines its nature: what it fundamentally is. On this type of account, the truthmaker for &quot;it is necessary that all cows are animals&quot; is that it belongs to the essence of cows to be animals. The truthmaker for &quot;there could have been purple cows&quot; is that color is not essential to cows. Some essentialist theories focus on object essences, i.e. that certain properties are essential to a specific object. Other essentialist theories focus on kind essences, i.e. that certain properties are essential to the kind or species of the object in question.

<doc id="454088" wikidata="Q7746320" url="?curid=454088" title="The Late Show (1992 TV series)">
<text>The Late Show is a popular Australian comedy sketch and satire show, which ran for two seasons on the ABC. It aired weekly on Saturday nights from 18 July 1992 to 30 October 1993.
==Cast==
&quot;The Late Show&quot; has its roots in the 1980s comedy group, &quot;The D-Generation&quot;. Consisting mostly of Melbourne University students, &quot;The D-Generation&quot; managed to gain a cult following with their radio and TV appearances.

After the breakup of the original &quot;The D-Generation&quot;, some of the members went on to perform on the commercial TV programme &quot;Fast Forward&quot;. The remaining members filmed several pilots for what was to be called &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; (no relation to the American show) at Channel Nine. These were rejected, and so the group accepted the ABC&#x27;s offer of a one-hour timeslot on Saturday night. The cast members were:

* Santo Cilauro
* Tom Gleisner
* Jane Kennedy
* Judith Lucy (season two only)
* Tony Martin
* Mick Molloy
* Rob Sitch
* Jason Stephens

==Segments==

&quot;The Late Show&quot; featured a number of popular, recurring segments.

===Introduction: Stand-up===
The show opened with a stand-up routine, usually by Martin and/or Molloy, but was sometimes opened by another of the hosts instead. The stand-up was often topical, usually focusing on the week&#x27;s news, or it was about a topic of the host&#x27;s choosing; for example, in one show Santo talked about his family&#x27;s highly ethnically styled home ‚Äî which was eccentric even by their community&#x27;s standards ‚Äî with the sequence in question complete with video clips of the house&#x27;s odd exterior and interior.

===The Late Show News Headlines===
&quot;The Late Show News Headlines&quot;, presented by Gleisner, would blend the week&#x27;s real news headlines with fake information and footage. For example, when covering the replacement of Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, footage from an Asian bodybuilding competition was shown. The News Headlines would also feature interviews with newsmakers, most often played by Sitch in costume and prosthetics, and sometimes in blackface or brownface. Some of the better-known impersonations included H. Ross Perot, Jeff Kennett, John Hewson, Paul Keating, Imran Khan, Yasser Arafat, Gareth Evans and Desmond Tutu (Sitch also appeared in other segments as Elton John among others).

===Mick&#x27;s Serve===

This would accompany the News Headlines, Molloy joining Gleisner at the News Desk as Gleisner would get Molloy to comment on a topical issue. This slowly escalated from discussing the issue with an ever calm Gleisner, to an irritated Molloy showing signs of annoyance with the issue, eventually Molloy would rant over the issue while becoming increasingly enraged. The skit would always end with Gleisner calling in Men in White Coats to douse Molloy and the News Desk with fire extinguishers.

===Street Talk===
In &quot;Street Talk&quot;, Martin and Molloy would take to the streets of Melbourne and interview passers-by on issues of the day. These vox-pop interviews often proved more of an opportunity for the pair to ridicule their interviewees, especially their dress sense.

=== The Oz Brothers ===
This segment saw Cilauro and Sitch as two siblings obsessed with the Australian cricketer David Boon. The segment featured catchphrases such as &#x27;I&#x27;ve had a gut full&#x27;, &#x27;This country&#x27;s stuffed&#x27;, and &#x27;I can&#x27;t burrleevet&#x27; (believe it). Their worship of all things Boon included praying to a small golden statue of Boon, playing Scrabble (only the word &#x27;Boon&#x27; was used by both brothers), posters of Boon adorning the walls of their home, and playing a Boon video-game in which the player could select the size of Boon&#x27;s moustache and gut. David Boon himself appeared in one episode in which he read the brothers a bedtime story.

===Celebrity interviews===

Martin went through hours to apply prosthetic make-up to be interviewed in-character as Paul Keating, Prince Charles, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Jackson.

* In the interview with &quot;Schwarzenegger&quot; hosted by Molloy, the two discuss &quot;Arnie&quot;&#x27;s films. &quot;Schwarzenegger&quot; talks happily about his latest project, and despite Molloy&#x27;s warnings to the crowd before &quot;Arnold&quot; came out on stage to not mention &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (a film which at the time was a bomb and a sore spot for the real Arnold), a crowd member mentions he didn&#x27;t like it, and &quot;Schwarzenegger&quot; shoots him dead on the spot, quipping &quot;Opinion noted.&quot;. &quot;Arnie&quot; proceeds to show off his latest movie trailer, a remake of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, updated and &quot;&quot;improved on&quot;, directed by &quot;Twins&quot; director Ivan Reitman, whom he comically and continually refers to as a &quot;genius&quot;&quot;.
* The interview with Prince Charles was a to-camera interview as he tours his home, talking about the features interspersed with jabs about how much he loathes things like sex with his wife Diana.
* The interview with Paul Keating was a satire of both journalism and politics during the era of Prime Minister Paul Keating going head to head with Opposition Leader Dr. John Hewson (seen in another episode as played by Sitch in prosthetic makeup).

===The Toilet Break===
&quot;The Toilet Break&quot;, as the name suggests, was designed to allow viewers time to use the toilet during the commercial-free show (the ABC, being a public broadcaster, has no adverts during shows and minimal amounts of commercials between them, usually only for the ABC Shop).

The 2-minute-long segment was played in the middle of every show, featuring old music clips, with a countdown displayed on the top left-hand corner of the screen. During the first season, the toilet break consisted mostly of clips from The Natural 7 from &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;. The second season exclusively used clips from &quot;Pot Luck&quot;, which were judged by Bernard King.

===Shitscared===
&quot;Shitscared&quot; starred Rob Sitch as a stuntman combining Evel Knievel and Ed Wood (in that he was similarly unable to grasp his own sheer incompetence and lack of aptitude in his chosen field) compounded by the &#x27;spanner in the works&#x27;, Mick Molloy as his half-witted assistant and Tom Gleisner as the interviewer. Sitch played the arrogant expert, who loved to pontificate about &quot;the stunt game&quot;. He would fashion detailed plans for each stunt, with an emphasis on &quot;safety&quot;. He would boast about his own significance, mumbling and glossing over any questions relating to poorly funded, rundown buildings and stunt apparatus variously referred to as &#x27;Stunt HQ&#x27;. Mick would always manage to ruin Rob&#x27;s planning, inevitably resulting in physical injury for Rob, which would get him a slap on the back of his head from Rob (although Mick was always wearing a crash helmet). The first two &quot;Shitscared&quot; sketches were shot at Channel Nine for the unaired pilots of &quot;The Late, Late Show&quot;.

===Pissweak World===
Several-minute advertisements for mediocre theme parks with the &#x27;Pissweak&#x27; brand name.
These included :
* Pissweak World
* Ye Olde Pissweeke Worlde (a parody of Renaissance Fairs)
* Pissweak Movie World (a parody of &quot;WB Movie World&quot;)
* Pissweak Aero World
* Pissweak Marine World
* Pissweak World Fun Park

Each would feature a guided tour with examples of the many low-quality attractions. Featuring The Pissweak Kids and Tom Gleisner as the Park Guide, with narration by Tony Martin.

Park highlight narration examples (from Pissweak Town):
* &quot;Ride a bucking bronco!&quot; ‚Äì clip showing a child sitting on a golden retriever (a.k.a. Charlie The Wonderdog).
* &quot;See a bush printing press!&quot; ‚Äì clip of a man holding a child&#x27;s head on top of a photocopier printing out a copy.
* &quot;Ride a stage coach!&quot; ‚Äì clip shows dejected children inside a trailer being driven down a road.

===Graham and the Colonel===
Similar to Roy and HG, &quot;Graham and the Colonel&quot; were two satirical sports commentators, played respectively by Sitch and Cilauro dressed in green ABC sports jackets. Whilst the characters often forgot lines and used many corny and humourless jokes, the segment was much loved. This segment aired just before the end of each episode.

The intro music for the segment was &quot;Light and Tuneful&quot; by Keith Mansfield, the same music used by the BBC to introduce its Wimbledon coverage.

===The Olden Days===
&quot;The Olden Days&quot; was a segment where the cast overdubbed &quot;Rush&quot;, a black-and-white historical drama series produced by the ABC in the 1970s. It was aired during the first series of the show.

Martin did the voice of the star of the show, Governor Frontbottom (as well as Judge Muttonchops). Molloy supplied the voice for the John Waters&#x27; character Sergeant Olden. Other characters were used intermittently.

&quot;The Olden Days&quot; was released by the ABC as a VHS video containing all the segments in order, although it has been out of publication for a number of years. On 15 August 2007, it was released on DVD in &quot;The Late Show Presents Bargearse and The Olden Days&quot; collection.

Actors Brendon Lunney and John Waters appeared as surprise guests on &quot;The Late Show&quot; after the last episode of &quot;The Olden Days&quot;.

===Bargearse===

Replacing &quot;The Olden Days&quot; in the second series of the show, &quot;Bargearse&quot; was an overdubbed version of &quot;Bluey&quot;, a 70s police drama set in Melbourne, Australia. The segment was originally to be an overdubbing of an Australian soap opera, &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, titled &quot;Medical Hospital&quot;, but the rights to the footage were pulled at the last minute. The ABC series &quot;Truckies&quot; was considered for overdubbing in a segment intended to be titled &quot;Truck Wits&quot;, before the writers settled on &quot;Bluey&quot;. This change left the writers with very little time, and as a result the planned 20 short episodes was cut down to 10, which aired in the second half of series two.

Bargearse was named after its protagonist, Detective Sergeant Bargearse, an overweight, moustache-sporting &quot;rough-and-tumble&quot; cop. The sketches exploited Bluey&#x27;s weight with plentiful fat jokes, as well as many fart noises.

Bargearse was voiced by Martin, while his sidekicks, Ann Bourke and Detective Glen Twenty (&quot;Glen 20&quot; is a household disinfectant spray in Australia), were voiced by Lucy and Sitch respectively. Other minor characters were revoiced by Cilauro, Molloy and Kennedy.

Lucky Grills, who played Bluey, appeared on &quot;The Late Show&quot; two times: as a guest in the mock press conference for the Biodome participants, and in the musical appearance as noted above.

On 15 August 2007 a &quot;Bargearse&quot; and &quot;The Olden Days&quot; double-feature DVD was released. The ten episodes are also available on the last two discs of the complete series of &quot;Bluey&quot; on DVD. 

The music used for the &quot;Bargearse&quot; theme music is the 1970 Jazz track &quot;Brass in Action&quot; by Keith Mansfield.

===Shirty: The Slightly Aggressive Bear===

&quot;Shirty: The Slightly Aggressive Bear&quot; was a parody of children&#x27;s TV shows. The twist was that the main character, Shirty, would react harshly to even the smallest insult. Many episodes ended with a destroyed set, a firearm being shot, or injury to the other characters. In the last episode of the first series, a sketch revealed that Shirty was played by the &quot;Hando&quot; character from &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; as played by Russell Crowe (though in a &quot;best-of&quot; episode two weeks prior, it had suggested that Shirty was routinely played by Molloy). It was stated on &quot;The Best Bits of The Late Show&quot; DVD commentary by Jane (who played the segment&#x27;s other recurring character, Miss Tammy) that Rob Sitch was in the suit. The Shirty costume was actually that of Percy Panda, a character played by Jack Manuel in the ABC children&#x27;s show &quot;Adventure Island&quot;.

===Charlie the Wonderdog===
&quot;Charlie the Wonderdog&quot; was a series of (7) short episodes which first aired during &quot;The Late Show&#x27;s&quot; second series. The segment was created after last-minute changes led to &quot;Bargearse&quot;‚Ä≥s planned twenty episodes being cut down to ten. Starring Charles &#x27;Bud&#x27; Tingwell and the &quot;Pissweak Kids&quot; (a group of children who also starred in the Pissweak World sketches), &quot;Charlie&quot; was a parody of fictional animal shows, such as &quot;Lassie&quot; and &quot;Skippy the Bush Kangaroo&quot; in which the animal regularly ends up saving the day. Charlie was a Golden Retriever owned in real-life by Gleisner.

The sketch featured purposely bad overacting from the children and usually involved an unimposing villain or disaster (such as a &quot;smuggler&quot; stealing &quot;native fauna&quot;‚Äîsticks and twigs‚Äîfrom the bush) that had to be prevented. The actors would constantly praise Charlie as a highly intelligent &quot;wonder dog&quot;, in contradiction of the behaviour of Charlie himself, who regularly had to be dragged around by a visible rope to perform stunts. When the dog was required to bark to alert the others of danger, obvious overdubbing was used over footage of Charlie with his mouth closed or looking distracted.

As the series went on, the problems and situations that Charlie faced became more and more over the top. Charlie was eventually assassinated in one of the sketches, only to come back in the &quot;Charlie the Wonderdog&quot; Christmas Episode.

===Geoff and Terry===
Geoff and Terry (Sitch and Cilauro, respectively) were two conman entrepreneurs, who would appear regularly with a &quot;new exciting product&quot; or scheme. Sitch and Cilauro primarily used the segment to make Kennedy, who played the interviewer, laugh and forget her lines. Kennedy also admitted in the &quot;Best of the Late Show&quot; DVD commentary that she was in fact drunk during one of the live sketches.

After a particularly bad performance Sitch and Cilauro vowed never to do &quot;Geoff and Terry&quot; again and the pair were reborn as &quot;The Oz Brothers&quot;.

===Music video parodies===

Parodies of real songs, complete with highly accurate recreations of music video sets, costumes and wigs.

The parodies included:

* Frente! ‚Äî &quot;Accidently Kelly Street&quot; (redone as &quot;Accidentally Was Released&quot;)
* The Sharp ‚Äî &quot;Scratch My Back&quot; (redone as &quot;Skivvies Are Back&quot;)
* Things of Stone and Wood ‚Äî &quot;Happy Birthday Helen&quot; (redone as &quot;(Got No More) Melbourne Cliches&quot;)
* Cameron Daddo - &quot;Fifteen Minutes of Fame&quot; (redone as &quot;Four and a Half Minutes of Shit&quot;)

===Other segments===
* Muckraking, a kind of celebrity gossip segment hosted by Molloy and Stephens, which often degenerated into irrelevant ranting.
* Commercial Crimestoppers, where amateurish commercials from regional Australia were mocked.
* Countdown Classics, a segment where footage from the Australian TV series &quot;Countdown&quot; was presented by Gleisner and Kennedy, who were dressed in &#x27;70s-era clothing, sitting on beanbags (one episode included a live performance of &quot;My Little Angel&quot; by William Shakespeare).
* Masterpieces of Modern Cinema, where Martin would criticise substandard cinema, for example &quot;&quot;, &quot;Armour of God&quot; and &quot;Houseboat Horror&quot;.
* Sink the Slipper, a segment where Martin and Molloy would identify and criticise a noted personality who had done or said something outrageous during the preceding week, and would then proceed, with each complaint they vocalised, to kick a fake pair of buttocks poking through part of the set which represented the personality.
* Original comedic musical numbers were also on the show, which included:
** A completely original number, Martin and Molloy performing &quot;What&#x27;s All That About?&quot;, the title reused in Molloy&#x27;s future work.
** Another included a stand up piece asking the audience what the baffling lyrics to &quot;Stand&quot; by R.E.M. meant before Martin performed his own live version of the song, showing that you could substitute any collection of bizarre statements for the actual lyrics.

&quot;The Late Show&quot; was also able to get many well loved Australian TV personalities on as guests. Charles &quot;Bud&quot; Tingwell played the grandfather in &quot;Charlie the Wonder Dog&quot;, and popular TV and radio voice-over man Pete Smith was also a regular. Many guests had cameos of only a few seconds, brought in for throwaway gags. One memorable joke had John Farnham offering wine, producing a bottle of water and smiling to himself.

===Musical finale===
All episodes in the second series ended with a musical performance. Martin would announce that Molloy had organised for a major celebrity to perform, only for Molloy to sheepishly admit he had accidentally booked another star with a similar name - most of whom were not famous for their musical ability. The humour in Molloy&#x27;s recurring &quot;errors&quot; in booking the performers may have run dry if not for the hilarity of having well-known Australian non-musical celebrities and politicians performing.

The performances included:
* Pete Smith performing Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;
* Norman Yemm singing R.E.M.&#x27;s &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;
* Mike Whitney as Whitney Houston performing &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;
* Australian Test cricketer Max Walker performing Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot;
* Australian swimmer Hayley Lewis with &quot;Hip to Be Square&quot; by Huey Lewis
* French-Australian chef Gabriel Gat√© performing &quot;Kelly Street&quot; by Frente!
* Ron Barassi as Shirley Bassey singing the theme from the James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot; (actually a Tom Jones song)
* Game show host &quot;Baby&quot; John Burgess performing &quot;One Word&quot; by Baby Animals
* Children&#x27;s television host Simon Townsend performing &quot;Who Are You&quot; by The Who (instead of The Who&#x27;s lead guitarist Pete Townshend)
* TV fisherman and football commentator Rex Hunt in a spangly costume covering T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;Get It On&quot;
* Actor Syd Heylen covering the Van Halen tune &quot;Jump&quot;
* Actor Donnie Sutherland as Dame Joan Sutherland
* TV weatherman Brian Bury singing Ian Dury&#x27;s &quot;Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick&quot;
* Television vet Dr. Harry Cooper as Alice Cooper performing &quot;Department of Youth&quot;
* Grassby, Grills, Nudge &amp; Plumb as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. The &quot;group&quot; was composed of Al Grassby (former Australian Immigration Minister); Lucky Grills (from &#x27;70s cop show &quot;Bluey&quot;); Christopher Truswell (who played the character of &quot;Nudge&quot; in the Australian sitcom &quot;Hey Dad&quot;); and veteran Australian actress Gwen Plumb
* Australian cricketer David Boon performing &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; as Talking Heads frontman David Byrne
* Premier of Victoria Joan Kirner covering Joan Jett&#x27;s &quot;I Love Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, accompanied on guitar by her former Health Minister David White who actually did play the guitar for the segment
* Australian variety show host, singer and entertainer Jimmy Hannan standing in for Jimmy Barnes, singing &quot;Working Class Man&quot;
* Boxing champion Lester Ellis as Vangelis playing the theme from &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; on piano (not included on the DVD)

&quot;The Late Show&quot; finale in 1993 had a &#x27;real&#x27; guest on to sing at the finale: Don Lane, who was notably appearing on a competing network during the show&#x27;s Saturday night timeslot.

Famous non-guests were Robert Gottliebsen (&quot;Addicted to Love&quot; by Robert Palmer) and Tony Bonner (&quot;This Used to Be My Playground&quot; by Madonna).

==After &quot;The Late Show&quot;==

Citing the effort involved in producing each week&#x27;s show, and the desire to explore other formats, the cast decided that the second season of &quot;The Late Show&quot; would be their last. Most of the performers remained in the Australian comedy scene.

Kennedy, Gleisner, Cilauro and Sitch formed Working Dog Productions, and made the TV programmes &quot;Frontline&quot; (1994‚Äì1997), &quot;Funky Squad&quot; (1995), &quot;A River Somewhere&quot; (1997‚Äì1998), &quot;The Panel&quot; (1998‚Äì2004), &quot;All Aussie Adventures&quot; (2001‚Äì2004) and &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; (2006‚Äì2009, 2023‚Äì), and the movies &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997), &quot;The Dish&quot; (2000) and &quot;Any Questions for Ben?&quot; (2012).

Martin and Molloy had a popular radio show &quot;Martin/Molloy&quot; (1995‚Äì1998) with co-star Pete Smith joining them often, before moving into film with &quot;Tackle Happy&quot; (2000), &quot;Crackerjack&quot; (2002), &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; (2003) and &quot;BoyTown&quot; (2006). Martin hosted a radio show on the national Triple M network called &quot;Get This&quot; (2006‚Äì2007), has written two books of humour‚Äî&quot;Lolly Scramble&quot; (2005) and &quot;A Nest of Occasionals&quot; (2009), has directed episodes of the ABC-TV comedy series &quot;The Librarians&quot; and in September 2011, began co-hosting &quot;The Joy of Sets&quot; on the Nine Network. Molloy hosted &quot;Tough Love&quot; from 2004 to 2006.

Lucy appeared in both &quot;Crackerjack&quot; and &quot;Bad Eggs&quot;, and continued to tour with a series of one-woman shows and in 2011, appeared in the ABC-TV series &quot;Judith Lucy&#x27;s Spiritual Journey&quot;.

Stephens became Director of Development for Fremantlemedia Australia, an Australian independent television production company.
He was the creator behind &quot;The Choir of Hard Knocks&quot;. He also produced and co-executive produced the 2007 film &quot;The King&quot;, the telemovie based on the life of Graham Kennedy.
Stephens also developed the comedy &quot;Newstopia&quot; (2007) starring Shaun Micallef. Molloy and Kennedy hosted the Triple M drive radio show &quot;Kennedy/Molloy&quot;.

=== 20th Anniversary ===
&quot;The Late Show&quot; celebrated its 20th anniversary on 18 July 2012. Martin tweeted: &quot;Thanks to all for Late Show anniv wishes. 20 years ago tonight I was preparing to tell the nation I&#x27;d just removed a hatstand from my arse.&quot;

<text>Sosthenes Behn (January 30, 1884 ‚Äì June 6, 1957) was an American businessman, and the founder of ITT. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Sosthenes Behn was born in the island of St. Thomas, then part of the Danish West Indies. His ancestry was Danish on his paternal side, and part French on his maternal side. His maternal grandfather was Sephardic Jewish.

Behn served in the United States Army and was commissioned a captain, Signal Corps, on June 19, 1917. He later achieved the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, having served with distinction during World War I. Behn served with the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) in France until February 1919. He was given command of the 232nd Field Signal Battalion, Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Saint-Mihiel, Argonne. In recognition of his meritorious service during the war he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM).

===Puerto Rico Telephone Company and ITT===
After his return from military service, Colonel Behn co-founded the Puerto Rico Telephone Company, which eventually spawned ITT. Under his direction ITT was granted the monopoly of telephone service in Spain (Compa√±√≠a Telef√≥nica Nacional de Espa√±a) in 1924, and purchased the international division of Western Electric, including a factory in Antwerp (the International Bell Telephone Company) which manufactured the Rotary telephone system.

According to Anthony Sampson&#x27;s book &quot;The Sovereign State of ITT&quot;, one of the first American businessmen Hitler received after taking power in 1933 was Sosthenes Behn, then the CEO of ITT, and his German representative, Henry Mann. Antony C. Sutton, in his book &quot;Wall Street and the Rise of Hitler&quot;, makes the claim that ITT subsidiaries made cash payments to SS leader Heinrich Himmler.

ITT, through its subsidiary C. Lorenz AG of Berlin, owned 25% of Focke-Wulf, the German aircraft manufacturer, builder of some of the most successful Luftwaffe fighter aircraft. In addition, Sutton&#x27;s book uncovers that ITT owned Dr. Erich F. Huth GmbH (Signalbau Huth, Berlin), which made radio and radar parts that were used in equipment going to the Wehrmacht.

Behn, along with his brother, Hernan, built the &quot;Two Brothers Bridge&quot; ‚Äî&quot;Puente Dos Hermanos&quot; in Spanish‚Äî in San Juan. The bridge links the districts of Condado and Old San Juan.

Colonel Behn and Ludwig Roselius, founder of the company Caf√© HAG, owned 74% of German aircraft manufacturer Focke-Wulf after the company reconstitution in 1936. Barbara Goette referred to Colonel Behn as a huge global player but never trusted him as he was involved with Hitler. Sosthenes Behn met with Hitler on August 3, 1933, and in 1936 there was a high-level meeting in Berlin, where it was proposed that Behn through ITT gain 50% of Focke-Wulf and oust Caf√© HAG completely; however, after Barbara Goette intervened with Hitler, Ludwig Roselius&#x27;s life was spared, he became the largest shareholder in Focke-Wulf with 46%, and a massive capital injection occurred.

During the war, all of ITT&#x27;s German holdings were put under Nazi control. These included a minority share in airplane manufacturer Focke-Wulf, which ITT had acquired through its contacts with German financier Kurt Baron von Schr√∂der. After the end of the war, the U.S. authorities returned these assets to their rightful U.S. owner.

Behn appointed Gerhard Westrick to the board of Focke-Wulf after the reconstitution in 1936. He was ITT&#x27;s corporation chairman in Germany. After Pearl Harbor, at meetings with Baron Kurt von Schr√∂der and Behn in Switzerland, Westrick nervously admitted he had run into a problem. Wilhelm Ohnesorge, the elderly minister in charge of post offices, who was one of the first fifty Nazi Party members, was strongly opposed to ITT&#x27;s German companies continuing to function under New York management in time of war. Behn told Westrick to use Schr√∂der and the protection of the Gestapo against Ohnesorge. In return, Behn guaranteed that ITT would substantially increase its payments to the Gestapo through the Circle of Friends. A special board of trustees was set up by the Nazis to cooperate with Behn and his staff of 30,000 in Occupied Europe. Ohnesorge savagely fought these arrangements and tried to obtain the support of Himmler. However, Schr√∂der had Himmler&#x27;s ear, and so, of course did his close friend and associate Walter Schellenberg. Ohnesorge appealed directly to Hitler and condemned Westrick as an American sympathiser. However, Hitler realized the importance of ITT to the German economy and proved supportive of Behn.

In 1943, ITT became the largest shareholder of Focke-Wulf Flugzeugbau GmbH with 29% due to Ludwig Roselius&#x27;s Kaffee HAG share falling to 27% after he died on May 15.

===Contributions to heritage, preservation and infrastructures===
Behn, along with his brother, Hernan, built the &quot;Two Brothers Bridge&quot; ‚Äî&quot;Puente Dos Hermanos&quot; in Spanish‚Äî in San Juan. The bridge links the districts of Condado and Old San Juan.

In 1928, following the advice of Paul Janet, a physicist and member of the French Academy of Sciences, he, together with his brother Hernand, acquired the former property of Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re in Poleymieux-au-Mont-d&#x27;Or near Lyon, which had just been put up for sale. The Behn brothers donated this property to the French Society of Electricians to ensure the scientist‚Äôs memory could be preserved through the establishment of a museum, the Amp√®re Museum, which is managed by the Society of Friends of Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re. Sosthene and Hernand Behn were honorary members of SAAMA until their passing.

===Death===
Behn died on June 6, 1957. He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<doc id="454093" wikidata="Q3273281" url="?curid=454093" title="Spark printing">
<text>Spark printing is an obsolete form of computer printing and before that fax and chart recorder printing which uses a special paper coated with a conductive layer over a contrasting backing, originally black carbon over white paper but later aluminium over black paper. Printing on this paper uses pulses of electric current to burn away spots of the conductive layer. Typically, one or more electrodes are swept across the page perpendicular to the direction of paper motion to form a raster of potential burnt spots.

Western Union developed the paper for this printing technology in the late 1940s, under the trademark &quot;Teledeltos&quot;. The Western Union &quot;Deskfax&quot; fax machine, announced in 1948, was one of the first printers to use this technology.

Spark printing was a simple and inexpensive technology. The print quality was relatively poor, but at a time when conventional printers cost hundreds of pounds, spark printers&#x27; sub-¬£100 price was a major selling point. The other major downside is that they can only print onto special metallised paper and such an electrosensitive paper is no longer widely available, but is still sold as of 2020.

== Models ==

By 1979, the Comprint 912 was widely advertised as being faster, quieter, and less expensive than competitive matrix printers, with its &quot;special aluminized &#x27;silver paper&#x27;&quot; being superior to ordinary paper, and &quot;on those rare occasions when you really do need a plain bond paper copy, just run your Comprint 912 printout through your plain bond copy machine and you&#x27;ve got it.&quot;

The Sinclair ZX Printer, introduced in November 1981 for the low-end ZX81 (and later for the ZX Spectrum) home computers used the spark printing method, and retailed for .

In the early 1980s, Casio released a &quot;Mini Electro Printer&quot;, the FP-10 for some of their scientific calculators. It used Casio CMP-36x5 paper.

The Hewlett Packard 9120A, which attached to the top of the HP-9100A/B calculator, also used the sparking technique.

Tandy / Radio Shack TRS-80 Screen Printer, Quick Printer, and Quick Printer II all used this same method and special paper.

The Sharp Corporation ELSIMATE EL-8151 portable calculator had a built in spark printer which used silver-colored paper. It is known to be compatible with the Casio CMP-36x5 paper used by the FP-10, despite the Casio paper having a slightly larger core diameter.

== Variants ==

A different spark printer implementation propelled dry toner from a tiny hole in the end of a glass rod, using a high-voltage spark between the platen and print head. The glass toner rod held a solid mass of toner, pushed toward the ejection tip by a spring. This had the advantage of printing onto plain paper, but the disadvantage of the toner not being cured to the paper, and thus easily smudged. Similar to the Sinclair printer, this printer had only one stylus (the toner rod), since the entire plate behind the paper served as the other spark electrode. The printer could only print one line of pixels at a time.

<doc id="454096" wikidata="Q2140297" url="?curid=454096" title="Rock n' Roll Racing">
<text>Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing is a vehicular combat-based racing video game developed by Silicon &amp; Synapse and published by Interplay Productions for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993 and the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994. The game prominently features a number of popular heavy metal and rock songs in its soundtrack, hence the game&#x27;s title. After Silicon &amp; Synapse rebranded into Blizzard Entertainment, a port to the Game Boy Advance was released in 2003. In celebration of the company&#x27;s 30th anniversary, a new version titled Definitive Edition alongside emulated re-releases of the original game were re-released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as part of the &quot;Blizzard Arcade Collection&quot; in February 2021.

&quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; was initially developed as &quot;RPMII&quot;, a sequel to the company&#x27;s previous game &quot;RPM Racing&quot;. At the end of the project, Interplay marketing added licensed music and changed the name to &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;. It is also similar in gameplay to &quot;Racing Destruction Set&quot; where it got its logic/AI engine and Rare&#x27;s 1988 NES game &quot;R.C. Pro-Am.&quot;

==Gameplay==
The game pits four racers against each other, with up to two of them being player-controlled from a colourful collection of comic-book-inspired humans and aliens, and the rest being AI opponents; &quot;Rip&quot; and &quot;Shred&quot;, who appear in all races, plus a third character unique to each planet/level in one-player mode. Each race consists of four laps around tracks viewed from an isometric perspective, which enables players to discern the presence of frequent sloping sections spread throughout the game&#x27;s various tracks. In addition to navigating the turns, racers must also maneuver hills and dips without falling or jumping over the guard rail at the track&#x27;s edge.

While it is a racing game, there is heavy emphasis on attacking competitor&#x27;s vehicles; since the cars always reappear with full health just a few seconds after blowing up, the only &quot;harm&quot; done is falling behind in the race. Players are rewarded with a monetary &quot;attack bonus&quot; each time they provide the finishing blow against another car using their forward or rear weapons (and a similar &quot;lapping bonus&quot; when they gain a full one-lap lead on an opponent during the race). In accordance with the continual destruction and restoration of the racing vehicles, the tracks are littered with mines and health power-ups, as well as money power-ups. Other hazards include oil slicks, snow drifts, and lava, depending on the planet hosting the race.

Players are updated on the race by commentator &quot;Loudmouth Larry&quot; (Larry &quot;Supermouth&quot; Huffman), who makes enthusiastic comments like &quot;The stage is set, the green flag drops!&quot; (or &quot;Let the carnage &quot;begin!&quot;&quot;), and &quot;[player name] is about to blow!&quot; at appropriate moments during the race.

Between races, players can spend the money they have earned on more advanced equipment for their vehicle (engines, tires, shocks, and shielding) or on increasing their capacity for the frontal weapon (energy blasts or missiles), rear weapon (slip sauce or mines), and turbo boost (jump jets or nitro boosts), each of which can max out at seven. Despite their limited capacity, every vehicle will have its weapon and boost charges replenished at the completion of each lap in a race. Racers can also buy more advanced vehicle models; however, all equipment and weapons upgrades are lost when a new vehicle is purchased.

The first three drivers to complete a race are awarded both money and points according to the final standings. Points are required for advancement to the next racing division or the next planet, with two divisions on each planet. A player who has not obtained enough points during a division&#x27;s racing season must repeat the division, again starting with zero points, but all changes to the player&#x27;s money and car remain in effect. In two-player mode, when only one player has sufficient points, the character in charge of advancement asks &quot;Leave your loser friend behind?&quot;, allowing the leading player to continue alone by removing the other player from the game. The dropped player can continue from that point later by using their most recent password, once the game is reset.

=== Music ===
&quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; is widely known for its soundtrack. Originally, Silicon &amp; Synapse wanted to use songs by ZZ Top but the fee was too high. They instead enlisted a company that provided low-cost licensed music in public settings.

The songs were uncredited but included:
* Bad to the Bone by George Thorogood and the Destroyers
* Highway Star by Deep Purple
* Paranoid by Black Sabbath
* Peter Gunn by Henry Mancini
* Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf
* Radar Love by Golden Earring (Sega Genesis and Definitive Edition only)
* Breaking the Law by Judas Priest (Definitive Edition only)
* Red Barchetta by Rush (Definitive Edition only)
* Power of the Horde by Elite Tauren Chieftain (Definitive Edition only)

=== Passwords ===
Passwords are given out at the beginning of each new &quot;racing season&quot; (each planet has its own definition of how many races make up a season, but early advancement will automatically start a new season), and they are located at the bottom of the F/X screen (accessible from the menu between races). These passwords are a complex code, consisting of three 4-digit sections, and they dictate everything about the players&#x27; progress: the character used, the vehicle type and color, weapons and parts upgrades, racing planet and division, difficulty setting, and money. The Game Boy Advance version of the game uses an EEPROM chip to save the player&#x27;s progress instead of the password system.

The password codes only allow the player to save a maximum of $999,990 (six digits); if there are more than six figures in the bank account, the password truncates the leftmost digits over six (e.g. if there&#x27;s $1,002,000 when the player quits, there will be only $2,000 when using the password to continue later). Due to the two-player password function, it&#x27;s possible to &quot;cheat&quot; by entering the same password for both players or by entering passwords for players who were at entirely different points in the game. The password with the lowest difficulty setting and on the earliest planet and racing division will be used as the basis for play from then on, which allows a Warrior-skill character with a maxed-out vehicle to race against Rookie-class AIs in the Rookie skill mode.

Though a password-generator QBASIC program exists, the passwords it creates often result in a glitch, causing the player to race on glitchy planets‚Äîthat exist only as a bug and can crash the game‚Äîafter racing on Inferno. In the Rookie skill mode, however, they work perfectly, as long as one doesn&#x27;t try to take the character beyond the third planet using the password.

A second password generator has been written in JavaScript and limits the available planets to reflect the chosen skill mode while retaining the ability to customize any other aspect of the data stored in the password.

==Release==
A 3DO Interactive Multiplayer version of &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; was announced to be in development and slated to be published by Interplay during E3 1995, but this version was never released for unknown reasons.

In 2003, Blizzard released an Adobe Shockwave-based demo version of the Game Boy Advance port featuring one track on its website.

In 2014, a demo version of the game featuring three tracks was added to Battle.net, emulated through ZSNES. This version has all rock music tracks changed to simple MIDI music, because the music license expired.

===&quot;Blizzard Arcade Collection&quot;===
In celebration of the company&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Blizzard Entertainment and Digital Eclipse released a compilation called &quot;Blizzard Arcade Collection&quot; in February 2021, for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch. The collection includes three Blizzard&#x27;s classic video games: &quot;The Lost Vikings&quot;, &quot;Blackthorne&quot; and &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;, with two additional games: &quot;The Lost Vikings 2&quot; and &quot;RPM Racing&quot;. Some of the modern features for the Definitive Edition include 16:9 resolution, 4-player split-screen, rewinding and saving of game progress, watching replays, and adding graphic filters to change the look of player&#x27;s game in the SNES and Genesis versions, as well as a togglable option between the SNES soundtrack and the master recordings of the soundtrack in CD quality. Larry &quot;Supermouth&quot; Huffman re-recorded lines from the original game, as well as recording brand new lines, for this release in the Definitive Edition.

==Reception==

&quot;GamePro&quot; gave the Genesis version a mixed review. They praised the Vs. mode and &quot;rockin&#x27;&quot; soundtrack with driving-appropriate tunes, but criticized the weak sound effects and remarked that the graphics and digitized voice are noticeably worse than in the Super NES version.

Super Gamer reviewed the SNES version and gave an overall score of 90% writing: &quot;Awesome rock soundtracks, plus plenty of vehicles, firepower, tracks and planets. A bit repetitive in one-player though.&quot;

===Accolades===

&quot;Rock N&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; was awarded Best Driving Game of 1993 by Electronic Gaming Monthly.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; the best Game Boy Advance game of July 2003.

IGN placed &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; 72nd on their Top 100 SNES Games of All Time. In 2018, Complex placed &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; 84th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 1996, GamesMaster rated the SNES version #96 in its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;.

== Sequels ==
=== &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Racing 2: Red Asphalt&quot; ===

A sequel to the original &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot; was made for the 32-bit PlayStation console by Interplay in 1997. The game was sold in Europe as &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Racing 2: Red Asphalt&quot; and in the United States as just &quot;Red Asphalt&quot;. It features a comic book art style in the character&#x27;s profiles and ending videos, and a system to upgrade each character&#x27;s driving/combat skills like RPGs.

=== &quot;Motor Rock&quot; ===
In December 2013, a game titled &quot;Motor Rock&quot; (development title &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing 3D&quot;) was released on Steam by Yard Team. It&#x27;s an unauthorized 3D remake of &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;. It was in development since 2009. A week after release, the game was removed from Steam.

<doc id="454104" wikidata="Q116861" url="?curid=454104" title="Fran Walsh">
<text>Dame Frances Rosemary Walsh (born 10 January 1959) is a New Zealand screenwriter and film producer.

The partner of filmmaker Peter Jackson, Walsh has contributed to all of their films since 1989: as co-writer since &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot;, and as producer since &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trilogy&quot;. She has won three Academy Awards for the final film of the trilogy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

== Early life ==
Walsh was born into a family of Irish descent in Wellington, New Zealand. She attended Wellington Girls&#x27; College intent on becoming a fashion designer, but eventually became interested in music instead. Occasionally taking time off to perform in a punk band named The Wallsockets, she attended Victoria University of Wellington majoring in English literature and graduating in 1981.

== Career ==
Walsh got her screen break writing material for New Zealand producer Grahame McLean on 1983 television film &quot;A Woman of Good Character (It&#x27;s Lizzie to those Close)&quot;. Later she wrote scripts for his TV show &quot;Worzel Gummidge Down Under&quot;.

Walsh met Peter Jackson in the mid-1980s during the final stages of production on his low-budget movie &quot;Bad Taste&quot;, in which aliens serve humans as fast food. Walsh has collaborated with Jackson on the scripts of all his subsequent films, after joining the writing quartet on his next film, the dark comedy &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; (1989). The couple then reteamed with writer Stephen Sinclair on the horror-comedy film that they had begun writing before Feebles, the zombie movie &quot;Braindead&quot; (retitled &quot;Dead Alive&quot; in the United States, 1992).

Walsh and Jackson have not married (2015). They explored new ground with the drama &quot;Heavenly Creatures&quot; (1994). The film was Walsh&#x27;s idea and was based on the friendship of the Parker-Hulme teenagers, who infamously later killed one of their mothers. The film earned the duo an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Walsh gave birth to Billy in 1995 and Katie in 1996. Walsh and Jackson returned to a more familiar genre with Universal Studios horror-comedy &quot;The Frighteners&quot; (1996), their first film funded by an American studio. They were in talks with Universal to remake &quot;King Kong&quot; until 1998&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; were first announced, and Universal decided against the film. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies. Wanting to try his hand at fantasy, Jackson turned to Miramax to make a film based on the works of writer J.R.R. Tolkien. In 1998, New Line Cinema provided the necessary financial backing to make a three-part adaptation of Tolkien&#x27;s classic &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Walsh, with Jackson and Philippa Boyens, is credited for writing the screenplays for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy (2001‚Äì2003) (Stephen Sinclair has a writing credit on the second film: &quot;The Two Towers&quot;). They shared many awards, including an Oscar for their adapted screenplay for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. She also was one of the film&#x27;s producers and co-composer of two songs for &quot;Return of the King&quot;, namely &quot;Into the West&quot; and &quot;A Shadow Lies Between Us&quot;, the former song earning her one more Oscar that night.

Walsh, Jackson, and Boyens continued their screenplay work together for the 2005 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;, which was given the green light by Universal after the Rings trilogy&#x27;s success. The couple collaborated on the adaptation of the novel &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; and on the three-film adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Walsh prefers to remain more private than Jackson or Boyens; she did not contribute an interview to the bonus features on &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; movie DVDs; however, she did feature on the director/writers&#x27; commentary (where she and Jackson discussed that they felt one of them should remain a private figure for the good of their family). Her vocals were used as a significant part of the screech of the Nazg√ªl in the films.

== Honours and awards ==
She won three Academy Awards in 2004, for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Song, all for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. She has received seven Oscar nominations.

In the 2002 New Year Honours, Walsh was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film. In the 2019 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, she was promoted to Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, also for services to film.

<text>The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, often shortened to the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), is a South African pan-Africanist national liberation movement that is now a political party. It was founded by an Africanist group, led by Robert Sobukwe, that broke away from the African National Congress (ANC) in 1959, as the PAC objected to the ANC&#x27;s theory that &quot;the land belongs to all who live in it both white and black&quot; and also rejected a multiracialist worldview, instead advocating a South Africa based on African nationalism.

==History==
The PAC was formally launched on 6 April 1959 at Orlando Communal Hall in Soweto. A number of African National Congress (ANC) members broke away because they objected to the substitution of the 1949 &quot;Programme of Action&quot; with the Freedom Charter adopted in 1955, which used multiracialist language as opposed to Africanist affirmations. The PAC at the time considered South Africa to be an African state by right an &quot;inalienable right of the indigenous African people&quot; and refused to support equal rights of the oppressed and oppressor, exploiter and exploited, the land dispossessor and landless Africans - &quot;the dispossessed&quot;. They insisted that the Historic Mission of the PAC of The People of Azania is &quot;The complete freedom, liberation and independence of Afrika.&quot; This entails political, social, economic and military independence. Robert Sobukwe was elected as the first president, and Potlako Leballo as the Secretary General.

On 21 March 1960, the PAC organised a campaign against pass laws. People gathered in the townships of Sharpeville and Langa where Sobukwe and other top leaders were arrested and later convicted for incitement. Sobukwe was sentenced to three years and Potlako Leballo to two years in prison. Sobukwe died in Kimberley, Cape Province, 1978 of lung cancer. Immediately after the Sharpeville massacre the National Party Government banned both the ANC and PAC on 8 April 1960. The PAC responded by founding its armed wing, the Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Army.
==Ideology==
The PAC followed the idea that the South African Government should be constituted by the African people owing their allegiance only to Africa, as stated by Sobukwe in the inaugural speech of the PAC:

&quot;We aim, politically, at government of the Africans by the Africans, for the Africans, with everybody who owes his only loyalty to Africa and who is prepared to accept the democratic rule of an African majority being regarded as an African.&quot;

It is Pan Africanism with three principles of African nationalism, socialism, and continental . Its body of ideas drew largely from the teachings of Anton Lembede, George Padmore, Marcus Garvey, Martin Delany, Kwame Nkrumah, and W. E. B. Du Bois.

The PAC initially advocated for a form of &quot;Africanist Socialist Democracy&quot;, based on African and Black Identity, with the aim of creating a South Africa (which they would rename Azania) for Black South Africans, to the exclusion of other nationalities or ethnicities. Unlike the African National Congress&#x27;s view on socialism, the PAC was stated to have rejected the concept of class oppression, instead focusing exclusively on national liberation. Nevertheless, their initial manifesto lists the &quot;black working class&quot; as the &quot;driving force in the struggle&quot; against white capitalists and &quot;reactionary&quot; middle-class groups. These socialist elements were strongly toned down by the 1990s, instead adopting a more &quot;conservative&quot; stance that sought not to restrict market forces and a commitment not to implement socialism &quot;for the sake of it&quot;. The Pan Africanist Youth Congress of Azania described the new program as the &quot;work of an element which is on the CIA payroll&quot;. However, by April 1992, the PAC&#x27;s party leadership in the Annual Congress no longer showed opposition to taking part in the multiracial negotiations to end the apartheid.

The PAC historically rejected Marxism, opposed communism (though it itself had borrowed from some Maoist tenets) and the inclusion of ethnic minorities within the liberation struggle, instead advocating black liberation exclusively within a Black nationalist concept.

==Leadership struggles==
The PAC has been beset by infighting and has had numerous changes of leadership since its transition to a political party. In 1996, Clarence Makwetu, who led the party in the 1994 elections, was removed on the basis of &quot;bringing the party into disrepute&quot;.

In August 2013, the PAC elected Alton Mphethi as president, after previous leader Letlapa Mphahlele was expelled in May amidst allegations of attempting to cause division in the party, financial impropriety and poor quality leadership.

A faction of the PAC continued to regard Mphahlele as leader. The matter was resolved in the courts, with Mpheti eventually being confirmed as party leader for the 2014 election.

Mpheti has since been charged with murder for the death of a Swazi national, Mthunzi Mavundla, and sentenced for R3 million school transport fraud.

Luthando Mbinda was elected president at the 2014 congress in Botshabelo, while Letlapa Mphahlele was elected in July 2015 in Manguang. Mbinda claimed that Mphahlele&#x27;s election was not valid, as he was not a valid member, while Mphahlele challenged his expulsion in court.

The Independent Electoral Commission suspended the party&#x27;s statutory fund‚Äôs allocations until there was clarity about who led the party, and in October 2015 the high court confirmed that Mbinda was the recognised leader.

Conflict then arose between Mbinda and Chief Executive Officer Narius Moloto. Mbinda was subsequently charged by the PAC and later expelled for bringing the organisation into disrepute. Narius Moloto was elected party leader in December 2017.

Infighting continued after the 2019 elections, with leader Narius Moloto unilaterally dissolving the party&#x27;s structures, a decision which was later set aside by the courts.

In August 2019, in Limpopo, one faction elected Moloto as leader, while a week later in Bloemfontein, another faction elected Mzwanele Nyhontso as leader. In October 2019, the Independent Electoral Commission recognised Nyhontso as the legitimate party leader.

In November 2020, speaker of the National Assembly Thandi Modise received notice that the PAC had expelled Nyhontso, and notified him that he had therefore lost his seat in parliament as the PAC&#x27;s sole representative. The opposing faction got a court order in December 2020 to reinstate Nyhontso, pending a court order challenging his removal from the party.

In August 2021, the court confirmed that Moloto&#x27;s election was invalid, confirming Nyhontso as president, and in September 2021 Nyhontso was again sworn in as the party&#x27;s sole MP.

In 2024, Nyhontso was again the sole PAC elected MP. He joined the Government of National Unity as Minister of Land Reform and Rural Development after the ANC lost its majority in parliament.

<text>Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha (born 10 April 1973), often known as Roberto Carlos and sometimes RC3, is a Brazilian former professional footballer. He has been described as the &quot;most offensive-minded left-back in the history of the game&quot;, and one of the greatest full-backs in history. In 1997, he was runner-up in the FIFA World Player of the Year. He is primarily known for his long career at Real Madrid and ever-presence in the Brazilian national team.

He started his career in Brazil as a forward but spent most of his career as a left-back. At club level, Roberto Carlos joined Real Madrid from Inter Milan in 1996 to spend 11 highly successful seasons, playing 584 matches in all competitions and scoring 71 goals. At Real, he won four La Liga titles and the UEFA Champions League three times. In April 2013, &quot;Marca&quot; named him in their &quot;Best Foreign Eleven in Real Madrid&#x27;s History&quot;. He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances at club and international level.

Roberto Carlos made his debut for the Brazil national team in 1992. He played in three World Cups, helping the team reach the final in 1998 in France, and win the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan. He was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team in 1998 and 2002. With Brazil he is especially known for a bending 40-yard free kick against France in the inaugural match of Tournoi de France 1997. With 125 caps he has made the fourth-most appearances for his national team. He was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in a 2002 FIFA poll.

He took up management and was named as the manager of Sivasspor in the Turkish S√ºper Lig in June 2013. He resigned as head coach in December 2014. From January to June 2015, he was manager of Akhisarspor. He announced his retirement from playing at the age of 39 in 2012. He briefly came out of retirement in 2015 when he was appointed player/manager of Indian Super League club Delhi Dynamos.

==Club career==
===Early years===

Roberto Carlos began his professional career playing for Uni√£o S√£o Jo√£o, a football club based in Araras in the state of S√£o Paulo. In 1992, despite playing at what was seen as a lesser club and only being 19 years old, he was called up for the Brazil national team. In August 1992, aged 19, he joined Atl√©tico Mineiro on loan and went on the club&#x27;s tour of Europe. The tour consisted of the B team, as the club was prioritising the first Copa CONMEBOL in South America at the same time. The tour served as a test for many players, and those who stood out could be integrated definitively to the main group. Roberto Carlos did not participate in the first two games in Italy but played the full match against Lleida in Spain on 27 August in a match for the Ciutat de Lleida Trophy. He remained in the team for the next two games, held in Logro√±o, against Logro√±√©s and Athletic Bilbao. Before retiring from football in 2014, Roberto Carlos thanked Atl√©tico Mineiro for the opportunity.

In 1993, Roberto Carlos joined Palmeiras, where he played for two seasons, winning two consecutive Brazilian league titles. After almost signing for Aston Villa in 1995, Roberto Carlos chose a move to Inter Milan, in the Serie A, playing one season for the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot;. He scored a 30-yard free-kick on his debut in a 1‚Äì0 win over Vicenza but his season at Inter was unsuccessful, with the club finishing seventh in Serie A.

In an interview with &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; in a May 2005 issue, Roberto Carlos said that the then-coach of Inter, Roy Hodgson, wanted him to play as a winger, but Roberto Carlos wanted to play as a left back. Roberto Carlos spoke to Inter owner Massimo Moratti &quot;to see if he could sort things out and it soon became clear that the only solution was to leave&quot;.

===Real Madrid===
Roberto Carlos joined Real Madrid in the year 1996 close season. When newly appointed manager Fabio Capello learned that Roberto Carlos had become transferable he barely could believe it, and he asked chairman Lorenzo Sanz to travel to Milan immediately. An agreement had been reached 24 hours later. Roberto Carlos was given the number 3 shirt and held the position as the team&#x27;s first choice left-back from the 1996‚Äì97 season until the 2006‚Äì07 season. During his 11 seasons with Madrid, he appeared in 584 matches in all competitions, scoring 71 goals. In January 2006, he became Real Madrid&#x27;s most capped foreign-born player in La Liga with 370 appearances, breaking the previous record of 329 held by Alfredo Di St√©fano. During his Real Madrid career, Roberto Carlos was, alongside Milan and Italy legend Paolo Maldini, considered the greatest left-back in the world. As a high-profile player and one of the most influential members of the team, Roberto Carlos was considered one of Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Gal√°cticos&quot; (which included Zinedine Zidane, Lu√≠s Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham) during Florentino P√©rez&#x27;s first tenure as club president.
He won four La Liga titles with Madrid, and played in the 1998, 2000 and 2002 UEFA Champions League finals, assisting Zinedine Zidane&#x27;s winning goal in 2002, considered one of the greatest goals in Champions League history. Roberto Carlos was named as Club Defender of the Year and included in the UEFA Team of the Year in 2002 and 2003. In the later part of his Real Madrid career, Roberto Carlos was named as one of the club&#x27;s &quot;three captains&quot; alongside Ra√∫l and Guti. Renowned for getting forward from his left-back position and scoring spectacular goals, in February 1998, he scored arguably his most memorable goal for Real Madrid with a bending volley struck with the outside of his left foot from near the sideline in a Copa del Rey match against Tenerife in what was described as an &quot;impossible goal&quot;.

On the final day of the 2002‚Äì03 season, with Madrid needing to beat Athletic Bilbao to overtake Real Sociedad and win their 29th La Liga title, Roberto Carlos scored from a free-kick in the second minute of first half stoppage time to put &quot;los Blancos&quot; 2‚Äì1 ahead. The team eventually ran out 3‚Äì1 winners to wrap up the title. On 6 December 2003, Roberto Carlos scored the opening goal for Madrid as they beat Barcelona in &quot;El Cl√°sico&quot; at Camp Nou for the first time in a La Liga match in 20 years.

In March 2007, in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 against Bayern Munich, Roberto Carlos failed to control the backpass when Madrid kicked off, allowing Bayern&#x27;s Hasan Salihamid≈æiƒá to steal the ball and feed to Roy Makaay, who scored the quickest goal in Champions League history at 10.12 seconds. Roberto Carlos bore the brunt of criticism for that mistake which led to the team&#x27;s elimination from the Champions League, and, on 9 March 2007, he announced he would leave Real Madrid upon the expiration of his contract at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. His final goal for Real Madrid was a stoppage time winner against Recreativo de Huelva with three games remaining in the 2006‚Äì07 La Liga season. The goal proved to be crucial to Real Madrid winning its 30th league title as they eventually finished level on points with Barcelona, becoming champions via the head-to-head rule. Madrid clinched La Liga in Roberto Carlos&#x27;s final match, a 3‚Äì1 win over Mallorca at the Santiago Bernab√©u Stadium.

===Fenerbah√ße===
On 19 June 2007, Roberto Carlos signed a two-year contract (with one year optional) with the Turkish S√ºper Lig champions Fenerbah√ße; he was presented at the club&#x27;s home ground, the ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium, in front of thousands of fans. In the first official match he played with the team, Fenerbah√ße won the Turkish Super Cup against Be≈üikta≈ü by a score of 2‚Äì1. During a league match against Sivasspor, he scored his first goal for Fenerbah√ße on 25 August 2007 from a diving header, which was only the third headed goal of his career. He was injured during the final period of the same season and missed the title race between Fenerbah√ße and rivals Galatasaray. His team eventually lost the title to their rivals, while guaranteeing a place for themselves in Champions League knockouts for the next season. He announced that he was unhappy about the final result and would do his best to carry the domestic trophy back to the ≈û√ºkr√º Saracoƒülu Stadium.

On 7 October 2009, Roberto Carlos announced that he would leave Fenerbah√ße when his contract expired in December 2009. He offered to return to Real Madrid and play for free, though he also said return to the Brazilian domestic leagues was a possibility, and announced his departure on 25 November. He made his last appearance for Fenerbah√ße on 17 December, as a late substitute against Sheriff Tiraspol in the UEFA Europa League.

===Corinthians===

After 15 years away from Brazil, Roberto Carlos returned to his country in 2010 to play for Corinthians, joining his friend and former Real Madrid teammate Ronaldo.
On 4 June 2010, Roberto Carlos scored a goal against Internacional and helped Corinthians to move to the top of the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A table. The &quot;Tim√£o&quot; won the game 2‚Äì0.
On 16 January 2011, Roberto Carlos scored an impressive goal directly from a corner kick against Portuguesa. Concerned with his safety after being threatened by fans after the Copa Libertadores da Am√©rica defeat to Colombian club Tolima, Roberto Carlos requested his release by the club, which was promptly facilitated by Corinthians.

===Anzhi Makhachkala===

On 12 February 2011, after being heavily linked with a move to Notts County, Roberto Carlos signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Russian Premier League club Anzhi Makhachkala, worth approximately ‚Ç¨10¬†million. Playing in a defensive midfield position, Roberto Carlos was named captain of Anzhi on 8 March. On 25 April, he scored his first goal for Anzhi in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Dynamo Moscow, converting a 58th minute penalty. On 30 April, he scored his second goal, converting a penalty in a 1‚Äì0 win over Rostov, and on 10 June, he then scored his third goal on a 20th minute in a 2‚Äì0 win over Spartak Nalchik.

On 11 September 2011, Roberto Carlos scored his fourth goal in a 2‚Äì1 win over Volga Nizhny Novgorod. As of his first season for Anzhi, Roberto Carlos made 28 appearances and scored five goals. On 30 September, he became the caretaker coach of Anzhi following the sacking of Gadzhi Gadzhiyev, before Andrei Gordeyev assumed the role also in a caretaker capacity. Roberto Carlos announced his plans to retire at the end of 2012, but continued to work behind the scenes at Anzhi. In August 2012, Anzhi coach Guus Hiddink confirmed his retirement at a news conference in Moscow, also stating, &quot;Roberto was a world class football player. Every master&#x27;s career ends at some point.&quot;

====Cases in Russia====
In March 2011, during a game away at Zenit Saint Petersburg, a banana was held near Carlos by one of the fans as the footballer was taking part in a flag-raising ceremony. In June, in a match away at Krylia Sovetov Samara, Roberto Carlos received a pass from the goalkeeper and was about to pass it when a banana was thrown onto the pitch, landing nearby. Carlos picked it up and threw it by the sidelines, walking off the field before the final whistle and raising two fingers at the stands, indicating this was the second such incident since March.

===Delhi Dynamos===
He ended his professional playing career with a spell as player-manager of Delhi Dynamos of the Indian Super League.

==International career==

Roberto Carlos amassed 125 caps, scoring 11 goals for the Brazilian national team. He represented Brazil at three FIFA World Cups, four Copa Am√©rica tournaments, the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 1996 Olympic Games.
He is especially famous for a bending 40-yard free kick against France in the inaugural match of Tournoi de France 1997 on 3 June 1997. The ball curled so much that the ball boy ten yards to the right ducked instinctively, thinking that the ball would hit him. Instead, it curled back on target, much to the surprise of goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who just stood in place. This particular attempt has been considered to be the greatest free kick of all time. In 2010, a team of French scientists produced a paper explaining the trajectory of the ball.

At the 1998 World Cup, he played seven matches, including the final loss to France. After a qualifying game for the 2002 World Cup which was held in South Korea/Japan, Paraguay goalkeeper Jos√© Luis Chilavert spat on Roberto Carlos, an action which caused FIFA to give Chilavert a three-match suspension and forced him to watch the first game of the World Cup from the stands. Roberto Carlos played six matches in the finals, scoring a goal from a free kick against China, and was a starter in the final against Germany, with Brazil winning 2‚Äì0. After the tournament, he was also included in the World Cup All-Star Team. Roberto Carlos later referred to the 2002 World Cup winning team as a ‚Äúband of brothers together‚Äù, and mentioned that the squad had a WhatsApp group and still talked regularly.

Roberto Carlos&#x27;s next international tournament was the 2006 World Cup. In July 2006, after Brazil&#x27;s 1‚Äì0 defeat to France in the quarter-finals, he announced his retirement from the national team, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve stopped with the national team. It was my last game.&quot; He said he no longer wanted to play for Brazil because of the criticism he faced from fans and Brazilian media for his failure to mark goalscorer Thierry Henry on France&#x27;s winning goal.

Upon signing with Corinthians in January 2010, Roberto Carlos told TV Globo that he hoped to play at the 2010 World Cup and believed his return to Brazilian football may help him return to the national team, as manager Dunga had yet to settle on a left back. However, he was left off the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010, along with Ronaldinho and Ronaldo. Despite his deep desire to do so, Roberto Carlos was ultimately not named in Dunga&#x27;s final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad for the World Cup. Instead, Brazil newcomer Michel Bastos earned a spot for the left back position.

==Style of play==
Tactically, Roberto Carlos started out playing football in Brazil as a forward ‚Äì usually as a centre-forward or outside forward ‚Äì but spent most of his career as defender, usually as a left-sided full-back or wing-back. In 2006, he was described as the &quot;most offensive-minded left-back in the history of the game&quot;, by John Carlin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;; indeed, he was known for his forward surging runs throughout his career. Roberto Carlos is also widely considered by several pundits as one of the best left backs in the history of the sport. During his time at Inter, he was also used out of position as a winger in a 4‚Äì4‚Äì2 formation on occasion by manager Roy Hodgson, which had a negative impact on his performances, and often saw him caught out defensively; in his later career with Anzhi Makhachkala, he was instead deployed as a defensive midfielder in a three-man midfield, in order to compensate for his loss of pace and physical decline due to his advancing age.

Roberto Carlos was nicknamed &quot;El Hombre Bala&quot; (&quot;The Bullet Man&quot;) throughout his career, due to his powerful bending shots and free kicks, which have been measured at over , and for which he became renowned. A set-piece specialist, he is regarded as one of the foremost free kick takers of his generation, and was known for being capable of striking the ball powerfully ‚Äì in particular from long range ‚Äì and of producing curling shots with the outside of his left boot in dead ball situations. A talented and consistent player, with good dribbling skills at speed, as well as precise passing and crossing ability, he also possessed significant strength and excellent physical qualities, which along with his pace, work-rate, and energy, allowed him to cover the left flank effectively and assist at both ends of the pitch. While he earned a reputation as a hard-tackler, he was also known for being a clean player throughout his career. In addition to his stamina, running speed, technical skills, and crossing ability, he was also known for his long throw ins, as well as his strong thighs, despite his small stature, which allowed him to accelerate quickly and strike the ball powerfully.

==Media==

Roberto Carlos has appeared in commercials for the sportswear company Nike. In 1998, he starred in a Nike commercial set in an airport in the buildup to the 1998 World Cup alongside a number of stars from the Brazil national team, including Ronaldo and Rom√°rio. In a Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Roberto Carlos starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scopion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside other star footballers, including Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Francesco Totti, Ronaldinho, Lu√≠s Figo and the Japanese Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament&#x27;s &quot;referee&quot;.

The score of the second match ended 4-3 for Ronaldinho&#x27;s team.

On 24 June 2005, Roberto Carlos was robbed by two gunmen while doing a live radio interview. He was not hurt but they took his watch and the interviewer&#x27;s cellular phone.

On 2 August 2005, he was naturalised as a Spanish citizen. This proved important for Real Madrid, as it meant that he now counted as a European Union player, opening up one of the club&#x27;s allowed three slots for non-EU players and enabling Real Madrid to sign fellow Brazilian Robinho.

For his 38th birthday, it was reported that Anzhi Makhachkala owner Suleyman Kerimov bought him a Bugatti Veyron.

Roberto Carlos has 11 children with 7 women. In October 2017, he became a grandfather when his daughter Giovanna gave birth to a son.

<text>MASSIVE (Multiple Agent Simulation System in Virtual Environment) is a high-end computer animation and artificial intelligence software package used for generating crowd-related visual effects for film and television.

==Overview==
&quot;Massive&quot; is a software package developed by Stephen Regelous for use in the visual effects industry. Its primary feature is its ability to rapidly create large groups of agents that can act as individuals, each with their own unique behaviors and actions.

Through the use of fuzzy logic, the software enables every agent to respond individually to its surroundings, including other agents. These reactions affect the agent&#x27;s behavior, changing how they act by controlling pre-recorded animation clips. Blending between such clips creates characters that move, act, and react realistically. These pre-recorded animations can come from motion-capture sessions or they can be hand-animated in other 3D animation software packages.

In addition to the artificial intelligence abilities of &quot;Massive&quot;, there are numerous other features, including cloth simulation, rigid body dynamics and graphics processing unit (GPU) based hardware rendering. Massive Software has also created several pre-built agents ready to perform certain tasks, such as stadium crowd agents, rioting mayhem agents and simple agents who walk around and talk to each other.

==History==
&quot;Massive&quot; was originally developed in Wellington, New Zealand. Peter Jackson, the director of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films (2001‚Äì2003), required software that allowed armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers to fight, a problem that had not been solved in film-making before. Stephen Regelous created &quot;Massive&quot; to allow WƒìtƒÅ FX to generate many of the award-winning visual effects, particularly the battle sequences, for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films. Since then, it has developed into a complete product and has been licensed by a number of other visual effects houses.

== Examples ==
&quot;Massive&quot; has been used in many productions, both commercials and feature-length films, small-scale and large.

Some significant examples include:
*&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;
*&quot;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&quot;
*&quot;Avatar&quot;
*&quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;

<doc id="454136" wikidata="Q300374" url="?curid=454136" title="A Collection of Great Dance Songs">
<text>A Collection of Great Dance Songs is a compilation album by the English rock band Pink Floyd. It was released on 23 November 1981 in the United Kingdom by Harvest Records and in the United States by Columbia Records.

==Content==
The album contains alternative mixes of &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; (comprised parts 1, 2, 4 and 7) and &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot;.

&quot;Money&quot; was entirely re-recorded, as Capitol Records refused to license the track to Columbia/CBS Records. David Gilmour re-recorded the track himself, playing most of the instruments, and co-produced the song with James Guthrie. Dick Parry reprised his saxophone parts on the track.

==Title and packaging==

The ironic title was a reference to the disco rhythms of &quot;Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)&quot;, as well as Nick Mason&#x27;s joke that the band&#x27;s U.S. label &quot;probably thought they were a dance band&quot;. The album art featured a photograph of ballroom dancers anchored to the ground so they cannot move. The inner sleeve had pictures of dancers on either a white (UK) or black (US) background.

==Release and reception==

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on 29 January 1982 and Platinum on 6 July 1989 and Double Platinum in August 2001. The album reached number 37 on the United Kingdom charts and number 31 in the United States. Columbia issued the remastered CD in 1997 in the US and most of the world save Europe. Then a 1997 remastered CD was re-released in 2000 on Capitol Records in the US and EMI for the rest of the world including Europe. The album was released once again in 2016 under the band&#x27;s Pink Floyd Records imprint, distributed by Sony Music internationally and by Warner Music in Europe, and was released on LP as well as CD.

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), Robert Christgau said of the album: &quot;With the rerecorded &#x27;Money&#x27; sporting a livelier bottom to protect them from truth-in-titling and felonious injury charges, this gathers up their tuneful moments, which have always been far between ‚Äì so far between, in fact, that even the unconverted may miss the ersatz symphonic structures in which they&#x27;re properly embedded.&quot; Rob Sheffield was less enthusiastic in &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), writing that both this compilation and the next, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Works&quot;, are &quot;pointless &#x27;hits&#x27; collections from a band that disdained hits&quot;.

<doc id="454139" wikidata="Q608489" url="?curid=454139" title="Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda">
<text>The Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (, FLEC) is a guerrilla and political movement fighting for the independence of the Angolan province of Cabinda. Formerly under Portuguese administration, with the independence of Angola from Portugal in 1975, the territory became an exclave province of the newly independent Angola. The FLEC fights the Cabinda War in the region occupied by the former kingdoms of Kakongo, Loango, and N&#x27;Goyo.

==History==

On February 1, 1885, the Treaty of Simulambuco was signed, establishing Cabinda as a Portuguese protectorate.

In 1963, three organizations ‚Äî the Movement for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (MLEC), Action Committee of the Cabinda National Union (CAUNC), and the Mayombe National Alliance (ALLIAMA) ‚Äî merged to form the FLEC.

During the Portuguese Colonial War (1961‚Äì1974), the nationalist movements of Cabinda fought against the Portuguese Armed Forces. After the Estado Novo regime which ruled Portugal and its overseas territories fell in the &quot;Carnation Revolution&quot; military coup of 25 April 1974 in Lisbon, independence was offered to all the territories abroad, including to Angola. In 1975 FLEC constituted a provisional government spearheaded by Henriques Tiago that proclaimed Cabindan independence from Portugal on August 1, 1975. Lu√≠s Ranque Franque was the president. 

FLEC broke into three factions; FLEC-Ranque Franque, FLEC-N&#x27;Zita, led by Henrique N&#x27;zita Tiago, and FLEC-Lubota, led by Francisco Xavier Lubota. In November 1977 another faction, the Military Command for the Liberation of Cabinda, was created. In June 1979 the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Cabinda created another movement, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Cabinda (MPLC, Movimento Popular de Liberta√ß√£o de Cabinda). In the 1980s FLEC received help from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which opposed the MPLA-controlled government of Angola, and from South Africa. In 1988, the Communist Committee of Cabinda (CCC, Comit√© Comunista de Cabinda) left the FLEC, led by Kaya Mohamed Yay. In the 1990s another faction, the National Union for the Liberation of Cabinda (Uni√£o Nacional de Liberta√ß√£o de Cabinda), led by Lumingu Lu√≠s Gimby, was created.

Another group was created by Cabindese expatriates in the Netherlands in 1996, the &quot;Frente de Liberta√ß√£o do Estado de Cabinda&quot; (FLEC (Lopes), Liberation Front of the State of Cabinda).

In December 2002, Angolan Armed Forces announced the capture of FLEC-Renovada.

FLEC-FAC has continued its struggle for independence both inside and outside Cabinda. In October 2006 FLEC-FAC asked for intervention by the African Union&#x27;s Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights. 

===Togo football team bus attack===
On 8 January 2010, while being escorted by Angolan forces through the disputed territory of Cabinda, the team bus of the Togo national football team was attacked by gunmen as it travelled to 2010 Africa Cup of Nations tournament. The ensuing gunfight resulted in the deaths of the assistant coach, team spokesman and bus driver, as well as injuring several others. 

An offshoot of the FLEC claimed responsibility. Rodrigues Mingas, secretary general of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda-Military Position (Flec-PM), said his fighters had meant to attack security guards as the convoy passed through Cabinda. &quot;This attack was not aimed at the Togolese players but at the Angolan forces at the head of the convoy,&quot; Mingas told France 24 television. &quot;So it was pure chance that the gunfire hit the players. We don&#x27;t have anything to do with the Togolese and we present our condolences to the African families and the Togo government. We are fighting for the total liberation of Cabinda.&quot;

==Kidnappings==
Members of the group have taken several foreign citizens hostage in Cabinda. In May 2000, FLEC-FAC kidnapped three foreign and one local employee of a Portuguese contractor who were released in two months.

==External support==

France has had a large interest in Angola. The French oil giant TotalEnergies which made a new offshore oil discovery in October 2009, has been expanding its presence in Angola. The country is the second largest contributor for production of TotalEnergies after Nigeria. According to Angolan media, France and Portugal will allow extradition of leaders of the separatist movement in the wake of the 2010 attacks on Togo&#x27;s football team for which FLEC claimed the responsibility.

<text>&quot;[[Don (honorific)|Don]]&quot; Diego de Castro Titu Kusi Yupanki (; Quechua: &quot;Titu Kusi Yupanki&quot; ) (15291571) was an Inca ruler of Vilcabamba and the penultimate leader of the Neo-Inca State. He was a son of Manco Inca Yupanqui, He was crowned in 1563, after the death of his half brother, Sayri Tupac. He ruled until his death in 1571, probably of pneumonia.

== Rule ==
During his rule at Vilcabamba, the provisional governor-general Lope Garcia de Castro wanted to negotiate with him. The negotiations were about Cusi leaving the Vilcabamba and accepting a Crown pension. After negotiations escalated, around 1568, Titu Cusi was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, as Diego de Castro.

Titu Cusi made T√∫pac Amaru a priest and custodian of Manco Inca&#x27;s body in Vilcabamba.

T√∫pac Amaru became the Inca ruler after Titu Cusi&#x27;s death in 1571. Titu Cusi&#x27;s close companion Mart√≠n de Pando, who had worked as a scribe for the Inca for over ten years and Augustinian Friar Diego Ortiz were blamed for killing Titu Cusi by poisoning him. Both were killed.

Cusi is the &quot;narrator&quot; and source of &quot;An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru&quot;, a firsthand account of the Spanish invasion, narrated by him in 1570 to Spanish missionary Fray Marcos Garc√≠a and transcribed by Mart√≠n de Pando, his mestizo assistant.

The resulting hybrid document offers a unique Inca perspective on the conquest. The confusion and misunderstandings of first contact are described in the account, including beliefs that the Spaniards were gods. The section that describes the moment when Manco Inca, the father of the author and the brother of Atahualpa, receives the first news of the Spaniards&#x27; arrival from coastal tribesman is of particular note.

<doc id="454151" wikidata="Q536814" url="?curid=454151" title="Negative liberty">
<text>Negative liberty is freedom from interference by other people. Negative liberty is primarily concerned with freedom from external restraint and contrasts with positive liberty (the possession of the power and resources to fulfill one&#x27;s own potential). The distinction originated with Bentham, was popularized by T. H. Green and Guido De Ruggiero, and is now best known through Isaiah Berlin&#x27;s 1958 lecture &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot;.

== Overview ==
&quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; describes negative liberty:
&quot;The negative concept of freedom ... is most commonly assumed in liberal defences of the constitutional liberties typical of liberal-democratic societies, such as freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech, and in arguments against paternalist or moralist state intervention. It is also often invoked in defences of the right to private property, although some have contested the claim that private property necessarily enhances negative liberty.&quot;

== History ==
According to Thomas Hobbes, &quot;a free man is he that in those things which by his strength and wit he is able to do is not hindered to do what he hath the will to do&quot; (&quot;Leviathan&quot;, Part 2, Ch. XXI; thus alluding to liberty in its negative sense).

Claude Adrien Helv√©tius expressed the following point clearly: &quot;The free man is the man who is not in irons, nor imprisoned in a gaol, nor terrorized like a slave by the fear of punishment ... it is not lack of freedom, not to fly like an eagle or swim like a whale.&quot; Moreover, John Jay, in &quot;The Federalist&quot; paper No. 2, stated that: &quot;Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity of Government, and it is equally undeniable, that whenever and however it is instituted, the people must cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it with requisite powers.&quot; Jay&#x27;s meaning would be better expressed by substituting &quot;negative liberty&quot; in place of &quot;natural rights&quot;, for the argument here is that the power or authority of a legitimate government derives in part from our accepting restrictions on negative liberty.

An idea that anticipates the distinction between negative and positive liberty was G. F. W. Hegel&#x27;s &quot;sphere of abstract right&quot; (furthered in his &quot;Elements of the Philosophy of Right&quot;), which constitutes what now is called negative freedom and his subsequent distinction between &quot;abstract&quot; and &quot;positive liberty.&quot;

In the Anglophone analytic tradition, the distinction between negative and positive liberty was introduced by Isaiah Berlin in his 1958 lecture &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot;. According to Berlin, the distinction is deeply embedded in the political tradition. In Berlin&#x27;s words, &quot;Liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: &#x27;What is the area within which the subject‚Äîa person or group of persons‚Äîis or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons&#x27;.&quot; Restrictions on negative liberty are imposed by a person, not by natural causes or incapacity.

Frankfurt School psychoanalyst and humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in his 1941 work, &quot;The Fear of Freedom&quot;, that predates Berlin&#x27;s essay by more than a decade. Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity&#x27;s evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, &quot;is here used not in its positive sense of &#x27;freedom to&#x27; but in its negative sense of &#x27;freedom from&#x27;; namely freedom from the instinctual determination of his actions.&quot; For Fromm, then, negative freedom marks the beginning of humanity as a species conscious of its own existence free from base instinct.

The distinction between positive and negative liberty is considered specious by some socialist and Marxist political philosophers, who argue that positive and negative liberty are indistinguishable in practice, or that one cannot exist without the other. Although he is not a socialist nor a Marxist, Berlin argues:
It follows that a frontier must be drawn between the area of private life and that of public authority. Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man&#x27;s activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. &#x27;Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows&#x27;; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others.

Objectivist thinker Tibor Machan defends negative liberty as &quot;required for moral choice and, thus, for human flourishing,&quot; claiming that it &quot;is secured when the rights of individual members of a human community to life, to voluntary action (or to liberty of conduct), and to property are universally respected, observed, and defended.&quot;

According to Charles Taylor, freedom means being able to do what you want, without any external obstacles. This concept has been criticized for being too simplistic and not taking into account the importance of individual self-realization. He thus suggests that negative liberty is little more than a philosophical term and that real liberty is achieved when significant social and economic inequalities are also considered. He proposed dialectical positive liberty as a means to gaining both negative and positive liberty, by overcoming the inequalities that divide us. According to Taylor, positive liberty is the ability to fulfill one&#x27;s purposes, while negative liberty is the freedom from interference by others.

==Monarchy example==
Thomas Hobbes&#x27; &quot;Leviathan&quot; outlines a commonwealth based upon a monarchy to whom citizens have ceded their rights. The basic reasoning for his assertion that this system was most ideal relates more to his value of order and simplicity in government. The monarchy provides for its subjects, and its subjects go about their day-to-day lives without interaction with the government:
The commonwealth is instituted when all agree in the following manner: &quot;I authorise and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorise all his actions in like manner.&quot;

The sovereign has twelve principal rights:
# because a successive covenant cannot override a prior one, the subjects cannot (lawfully) change the form of government.
# because the covenant forming the commonwealth is the subjects giving to the sovereign the right to act for them, the sovereign cannot possibly breach the covenant; and therefore the subjects can never argue to be freed from the covenant because of the actions of the sovereign.
# the selection of sovereign is (in theory) by majority vote; the minority have agreed to abide by this.
# every subject is author of the acts of the sovereign: hence the sovereign cannot injure any of his subjects, and cannot be accused of injustice.
# following this, the sovereign cannot justly be put to death by the subjects.
# because the purpose of the commonwealth is peace, and the sovereign has the right to do whatever he thinks necessary for the preserving of peace and security and prevention of discord, therefore the sovereign may judge what opinions and doctrines are averse; who shall be allowed to speak to multitudes; and who shall examine the doctrines of all books before they are published.
# to prescribe the rules of civil law and property.
# to be judge in all cases.
# to make war and peace as he sees fit; and to command the army.
# to choose counsellors, ministers, magistrates and officers.
# to reward with riches and honour; or to punish with corporal or pecuniary punishment or ignominy.
# to establish laws of honour and a scale of worth.

Hobbes explicitly rejects the idea of &quot;Separation of Powers&quot;, in particular the form that would later become the separation of powers under the United States Constitution. Part 6 is a perhaps underemphasised feature of his argument, explicitly in favour of censorship of the press and restrictions on the rights of free speech, should they be considered desirable by the sovereign in order to promote order.

Upon closer inspection of &quot;Leviathan&quot;, it is clear he believed a person in society must give up liberty to a sovereign. Whether that sovereign is an absolute monarch or other form was left open to debate. He viewed the absolute monarch as the best of all options, writing:

For as amongst masterless men, there is perpetual war, of every man against his neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the son, nor to expect from the father; no propriety of goods, or lands; no security; but a full and absolute liberty in every particular man: so in states, and commonwealths not dependent on one another, every commonwealth, not every man, has an absolute liberty, to do what it shall judge, that is to say, what that man, or assembly that representeth it, shall judge most conducing to their benefit.

<doc id="454154" wikidata="Q1186251" url="?curid=454154" title="Wisconsin Territory">
<text>The Territory of Wisconsin was an organized and incorporated territory of the United States that existed from July 3, 1836, until May 29, 1848, when an eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Wisconsin. Belmont was initially chosen as the capital of the territory. In 1837, the territorial legislature met in Burlington, just north of the Skunk River on the Mississippi, which became part of the Iowa Territory in 1838. In that year, 1838, the territorial capital of Wisconsin was moved to Madison.

==Territorial area==
The Wisconsin Territory initially included all of the present-day states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa, as well as part of the Dakotas east of the Missouri River. Much of the territory had originally been part of the Northwest Territory, which was ceded by Britain in 1783. The portion in what is now Iowa and the Dakotas was originally part of the Louisiana Purchase, though a small fraction was part of a parcel ceded by Great Britain in 1818, and was split off from the Missouri Territory in 1821 and attached to the Michigan Territory in 1834.

The portion that was formerly part of the Northwest Territory and which later became the state of Wisconsin was part of the Indiana Territory when this was formed in 1800. In 1809, it became part of the Illinois Territory; then, when Illinois was about to become a state in 1818, this area was joined to the Michigan Territory. Then the Wisconsin Territory was split off from Michigan Territory in 1836 as the state of Michigan prepared for statehood. In 1838, the section of the territory to the west of the Mississippi became the Iowa Territory.

In 1838, the Iowa Territory was formed, reducing the Wisconsin Territory to the boundaries for the next ten years; upon granting statehood to Wisconsin, its boundaries were once again reduced, to their present location.

In 1850, 10 years after the end of the Second Great Awakening (1790‚Äì1840), of the 341 churches with regular services in the Wisconsin, 110 were Methodist, 64 were Catholic, 49 were Baptist, 40 were Presbyterian, 37 were Congregationalist, 20 were Lutheran, 19 were Episcopal, and
2 were Dutch Reformed.
In the 1840 United States census, 22 counties in the Wisconsin Territory reported the following population counts:
==History==

There are irregularities in the historical timeline at the outset of the Territory. After Congress refused Michigan&#x27;s petition for statehood, despite meeting the requirements specified in the Northwest Ordinance, the people of Michigan authorized its constitution in October 1835 and began self-governance at that time. Yet, Michigan did not enter the Union until January 26, 1837, and Congress did not organize the Wisconsin Territory separately from Michigan until July 3, 1836.

Hoping to provide for some continuity in governance during that interim, acting Governor of the Michigan Territory, Stevens T. Mason, issued a proclamation on August 25, 1835, that called for the election of a &quot;western&quot; legislative council (the Seventh Michigan Territorial Council), which became known as the &quot;Rump Council&quot;. This council was to meet in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on January 1, 1836. However, because of the controversy between Michigan and Ohio over the Toledo Strip, known as the Toledo War, President Jackson removed Mason from office on August 15, 1835, and replaced him with John S. Horner. Horner issued his own proclamation on November 9, 1835, calling for the council to meet on December 1, 1835 ‚Äî giving delegates less than a month to learn of the change and travel to the meeting. This caused considerable annoyance among the delegates, who ignored it. Even Horner himself neglected to attend. The Council convened on January 1 as previously scheduled, but Horner, while reportedly intending to attend, was delayed by illness and in the Governor&#x27;s absence the council could do little more than perform some administrative and ceremonial duties. For its concession to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the Upper Peninsula.

President Andrew Jackson appointed Henry Dodge Governor and Horner Secretary. The first legislative assembly of the new territory was convened by Governor Dodge at Belmont, in the present Lafayette County, on October 25, 1836. In 1837, Burlington, Iowa, became the second territorial capital of the Wisconsin Territory. The next year, the Iowa Territory was created and the capital was moved to Madison.

=== Wisconsin Enabling Act ===
In 1846, Congress approved the Wisconsin Enabling Act, which was the first step on the road to statehood for Wisconsin. Wisconsin would become the fifth state created out of the old Northwest Territory. Representing the expressed intent of the Wisconsin territorial legislature, Morgan Lewis Martin, Wisconsin&#x27;s territorial delegate to Congress, initially argued that the proposed state should incorporate all remaining land in the original Northwest Territory as defined by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

Most members of Congress believed that such a state would be too large. They eventually accepted the argument of Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, chairman of the House Committee on Territories, that Congress was not bound by the Northwest Ordinance, and passed legislation allowing a sixth state to be formed from the remnant of the Northwest Territory excluded from the new state of Wisconsin. However, subsequent bills in 1847 and 1848 to organize a new &quot;Territory of Minasota&quot; were rejected on the grounds that &quot;Minasota&quot; did not have anywhere near the 5,000 free adult males required for legal territorial status.

===Wisconsin Territory after Wisconsin became a state===
When Wisconsin became a state on May 29, 1848, no provision was made for the section of land between the St. Croix River and the Mississippi River which had previously been organized as part of Wisconsin Territory. Additionally when Iowa became a state on December 28, 1846, no provision was made for official organization of the remainder of what had been Iowa Territory. 

In the summer of 1848, residents in the area organized themselves and called a series of meetings. As these meetings commenced, the most recent territorial delegate to congress John H. Tweedy officially tendered his resignation, thus vacating the seat. Secretary of State John Catlin went to Stillwater, Minnesota, and in the capacity of acting governor of the territory issued writs for a special election to fill the seat, which was won by Henry H. Sibley on October 30.

When Sibley went to Washington to take his seat in Congress, he was not immediately recognized. Only after a long political battle was he allowed to take his seat on January 15, 1849. For a period of time, there were simultaneously representatives in Congress from both the State of Wisconsin and the Territory of Wisconsin, an unprecedented situation. Sibley made it his first order of business to push through the statute necessary to establish the Territory of Minnesota, which occurred on March 3, 1849.

==Legislature==
The Legislative Assembly of the Wisconsin Territory consisted of a council (equivalent to a senate) and representatives. The first session of the First Legislative Assembly convened at Belmont, Iowa County (now in Lafayette County), on October 25, and adjourned December 9, 1836. The Council at that time had 14 seats, and was presided over by Henry Baird of Brown County. There were 26 representatives; the Speaker of the House was Peter H. Engle of Dubuque County (&quot;Dubuque County&quot; at this time embraced all of the territory west of the Mississippi River and north of the latitude of the south end of Rock Island).

The last session of the assembly was the second session of the Fifth Legislative Assembly, which convened February 7, and adjourned March 13, 1848.

<doc id="454155" wikidata="Q1120700" url="?curid=454155" title="Orson Bean">
<text>Orson Bean (born Dallas Frederick Burrows; July 22, 1928¬†‚Äì February 7, 2020) was an American film, television, and stage actor and comedian. He was a game show and talk show host and a &quot;mainstay of Los Angeles‚Äô small theater scene.&quot; He appeared frequently on several televised game shows from the 1960s through the 1980s and was a longtime panelist on the television game show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. &quot;A storyteller &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;, he was a favorite of Johnny Carson, appearing on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; more than 200 times.

In the 1960s, Bean remarked in an interview that he became known as a &quot;neocelebrity who&#x27;s famous for being famous&quot; for his appearances as a panellist on television prime-time gameshows.

==Early life==
Bean was born in Burlington, Vermont, in 1928, while his first cousin twice removed, Calvin Coolidge, was President of the United States. Bean was the son of Marian Ainsworth (&quot;n√©e&quot; Pollard) and George Frederick Burrows. His father was a founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a fund-raiser for the Scottsboro Boys&#x27; defense, and a 20-year member of the campus police of Harvard College. Bean said his house was &quot;full of causes&quot;. He left home at 16 after his mother died by suicide.

Bean graduated from Rindge Technical High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1946. He then joined the United States Army and was stationed in Japan for a year. Following his military service, Bean began working in small venues as a stage magician before moving in the early 1950s to stand-up comedy. He studied theatre at HB Studio.

==Stage name==
In an interview on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in 1974 Bean recounted the source of his stage name. He credited its origin to a piano player named Val at &quot;Hurley&#x27;s Log Cabin&quot;, a restaurant and nightclub in Boston where he had once performed. According to Bean, every evening before he went on stage at the nightclub Val would suggest to him a silly name to use when introducing himself to the audience. One night, for example, the piano player suggested &quot;Roger Duck,&quot; but the young comedian got very few laughs after using that name in his performance. On another night, the musician suggested &quot;Orson Bean&quot; and the comedian received a great response from the audience, a reaction so favorable that it resulted in a job offer that same evening from a local theatrical booking agent. Given his success on that occasion, Bean decided to keep using the odd-sounding but memorable name. (Bean again told the story nearly verbatim on the Carson show September 23, 1976, but Carson appeared to not remember having heard it before.)

Bean claimed that his name was a blend of the pompous and the amusing. He recalled that Orson Welles once called him over to a table and said, &quot;You stole my name,&quot; and then dismissed him with a wave.

==Rising comedian==
In 1952, Bean received his first national exposure when NBC Radio revived its hot-jazz series &quot;The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street&quot;. This burlesque of stuffy symphonic and operatic broadcasts featured dixieland jam sessions, with the host (always introduced as a doctor of music) reciting dignified commentary in jazz-musician slang. NBC had broadcast the series off and on since 1940, and it was revived for a 13-week run with &quot;Dr. Orson Bean&quot; as host. Bean&#x27;s august, bemused delivery belied the fact that this eminent professor was only 23 years old. Bean also hosted a &quot;Lower Basin Street&quot; half-hour TV special, which aired on Sunday, June 15, 1952 at 5:30 p.m.

For 10 years, he was the house comic at New York&#x27;s Blue Angel comedy club. In 1954, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted in a review of The Blue Angel, Bean&#x27;s delivery was always well played, even if a joke fell flat. In the summer of 1954, he hosted a television show, &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, on CBS in which he served as emcee, introducing various acts at the simulated nightclub. &quot;Time Magazine&quot;, reviewing the show, called Bean &quot;a quiet, wry, young comedian ... who has a happy way with a joke&quot;. He &quot;maintained a steady career since the 1950s and cut his teeth on and off Broadway before becoming a live-television staple.&quot;

==Temporary eclipse==
Bean was placed on the Hollywood blacklist for attending Communist Party meetings while dating a member, but continued to work through the 1950s and 1960s. &quot;Basically I was blacklisted because I had a cute communist girlfriend,&quot; he said in a 2001 interview. He only stopped working in television for a year. An appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was cancelled due to his being on the blacklist and he was rendered &quot;persona non grata&quot; there for years because of it. Sullivan eventually relented and re-booked him, declaring that he was the master of his own show, not &quot;Campbell&#x27;s Soup.&quot;(Per the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sullivan &quot;noting that &#x27;it was Campbell Soup that did the blacklisting, not CBS.&#x27;&quot;)

==Theatre==
On Broadway Bean starred in the original cast of &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; with Walter Matthau and Jayne Mansfield. Then, in 1961, he was featured in &quot;Subways Are for Sleeping&quot; with Sydney Chaplin, for which he received a Tony Award nomination as Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Bean performed in &quot;Never Too Late&quot; the following year. In 1964, he produced the Off-Off-Broadway musical &quot;Home Movies&quot; ‚Äî which won an Obie Award. And the same year, he appeared in the Broadway production &quot;I Was Dancing&quot;. Bean starred in the musical revue &quot;John Murray Anderson‚Äôs Almanac&quot;. He also voiced and sang the role of Charlie Brown on MGM&#x27;s original 1966 concept album of the musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot;, and starred in &quot;Illya Darling&quot;, the 1967 musical adaptation of the film &quot;Never on Sunday&quot;.

He was a chief creator and &quot;mainstay&quot; of The Pacific Resident Theatre in Venice, California.

== Television ==
Bean played the title character in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Mr. Bevis&quot; (1960) that was an unsuccessful television pilot. For the CBS anthology series &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, he starred as John Monroe in &quot;The Country Mouse&quot; (1961), based on the works of the American humorist James Thurber, an episode which was later developed into the series &quot;My World and Welcome to It&quot; on NBC, starring William Windom in the Monroe role.

Among dozens of appearances, Bean starred in &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, and &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; while tallying guest appearance credits on programs such as &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, and &quot;The Closer&quot;. Bean was a regular in both &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Fernwood 2Nite&quot;. He also portrayed the shrewd businessman and storekeeper Loren Bray on the television series &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; throughout its six-year run on CBS in the 1990s. He voiced the main characters Bilbo and Frodo Baggins in the 1977 and 1980 Rankin/Bass animated adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. In 2000, he appeared in the &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; episode &quot;There But For the Grace of Grace&quot; as Will Truman and Grace Adler&#x27;s old college professor. He also appeared in the short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;Normal, Ohio&quot; as the homophobic father of a gay man (played by John Goodman).

Bean appeared as a patient in the final two episodes of &quot;7th Heaven&quot;‚Ä≥s seventh season in 2003. In 2005, Bean appeared in the sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot; in an episode titled &quot;Does This Smell Funny to You?&quot;, playing a former playboy whose conquests included actresses Tuesday Weld and Anne Francis. He appeared in the 2007 &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; episode &quot;Slapsgiving&quot; as Robin Scherbatsky&#x27;s 41-year-old boyfriend, Bob. In 2009 he was cast in the recurring role of Roy Bender, a steak salesman, who is Karen McCluskey&#x27;s love interest on the ABC series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. At the age of 87, Bean in 2016 appeared in &quot;Playdates&quot;, an episode of the American TV sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot;. He appeared in a 2017 episode of &quot;Teachers&quot; (TV Land, season 2, episode 11, &quot;Dosey Don&#x27;t&quot;). He appeared at the age of 89 as a doctor in the &quot;Superstore&quot; episode &quot;Delivery Day&quot; in 2019. In 2020, Bean appeared in the Netflix series &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, as the rascally character Bruno, a potential green card spouse for Joan-Margaret, in the episode &quot;The Scent&quot; (S6E10). It was Bean&#x27;s final television performance.

=== Game shows ===
Doing stand-up comedy and magic tricks, and passing on wit and wisdom, he became a regular on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. He appeared on game shows originating from New York. He was a regular panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in versions from the late 1950s through 1991. He appeared on &quot;Super Password&quot; and &quot;Match Game&quot;, among other game shows. He hosted a pilot for a revamped version of &quot;Concentration&quot; in 1985; it was not picked up, but elements carried over to &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; with Alex Trebek, primarily the theme, graphics and announcer Gene Wood.

=== Talk and variety shows ===
A skilled raconteur, Bean was a popular guest on various television talk and variety shows, e.g., &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; (with both Jack Paar and Johnny Carson), where he made frequent appearances.

== Film ==
Bean played the eccentric, foul-mouthed Dr. Lester in Spike Jonze&#x27;s 1999 film, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;. He also appeared as a Holocaust survivor in the 2018 film &quot;The Equalizer 2&quot; and as Meg Ryan&#x27;s editor in Joe Dante&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Innerspace&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bean was married three times. His first marriage was in 1956 to actress Jacqueline de Sibour, whose stage name was Rain Winslow. Sibour was the daughter of French nobleman and pilot Vicomte Jacques de Sibour and his wife Violette B. Selfridge (daughter of American-born British department-store magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge). Before their divorce in 1962, Bean and Jacqueline had one child, Michele.

In 1965, he married actress and fashion designer Carolyn Maxwell, with whom he had three children: Max, Susannah, and Ezekiel. The couple divorced in 1981. Their daughter Susannah was married to journalist Andrew Breitbart from 1997 until his death in 2012. In the early 1970s Bean took his family on a sabbatical break from New York to live briefly (for about three months) on a farm commune in Victoria, Australia.

Bean&#x27;s third wife was &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; co-star Alley Mills. They married in 1993 and lived in Los Angeles until his death in 2020. When Mills was baptized as an adult, Bean walked with her down to the beach so &quot;Pastor Ken&quot; from First Lutheran Church of Venice could baptize her in the waters of the Pacific Ocean. For many years, Bean and Mills played roles in First Lutheran&#x27;s annual production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;; Bean played Ebenezer Scrooge.

An admirer of Laurel and Hardy, Bean, in 1965, was a founding member of The Sons of the Desert. This international organization is devoted to sharing information about the lives of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy and preserving and enjoying their films.

In 1966, he helped found the 15th Street School in New York City, a primary school using the radical, democratic, free school Summerhill as a model. Bean wrote an autobiographical account about his life-changing experience with the orgone therapy developed by Austrian-born psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich. Published in 1971, the account is titled &quot;Me and the Orgone: The True Story of One Man&#x27;s Sexual Awakening&quot;.

He was a distant cousin of President Calvin Coolidge. In later life, &quot;his politics turned more conservative&quot; and he authored intermittent columns for &quot;Breitbart News&quot;. He ventured the thought that being a conservative in 21st-century Hollywood was much like being a suspected Communist back in the 1950s.

For much of his career and until his death, he was represented by the Artists &amp; Representatives agency. In its brief statement after his death, they noted he was an &quot;assiduous nurturer of rising talent&quot;.

==Death==
On February 7, 2020, while crossing Venice Boulevard in the Venice section of Los Angeles, Bean died from complications of a traffic accident. He was struck by the drivers of two vehicles, with the second driver striking him fatally. The driver of the first vehicle &quot;did not see him and clipped him and he went down&quot;, said Los Angeles Police Department Captain Brian Wendling. &quot;A second vehicle&#x27;s driver was distracted by people trying to slow him down; when the driver looked ahead, a second traffic collision occurred and it caused the death of Bean.&quot;

<doc id="454164" wikidata="Q1155605" url="?curid=454164" title="Upper class">
<text>Upper class in modern societies is the social class composed of people who hold the highest social status. Usually, these are the wealthiest members of class society, and wield the greatest political power. According to this view, the upper class is generally distinguished by immense wealth which is passed on from generation to generation. Prior to the 20th century, the emphasis was on &quot;aristocracy&quot;, which emphasized generations of inherited noble status, not just recent wealth.

Because the upper classes of a society may no longer rule the society in which they are living, they are often referred to as the old upper classes, and they are often culturally distinct from the newly rich middle classes that tend to dominate public life in modern social democracies. According to the latter view held by the traditional upper classes, no amount of individual wealth or fame would make a person from an undistinguished background into a member of the upper class as one must be born into a family of that class and raised in a particular manner to understand and share upper class values, traditions, and cultural norms. The term is often used in conjunction with terms like upper-middle class, middle class, and working class as part of a model of social stratification.

==Historical meaning==

Historically in some cultures, members of an upper class often did not have to work for a living, as they were supported by earned or inherited investments (often real estate), although members of the upper class may have had less actual money than merchants. Upper-class status commonly derived from the social position of one&#x27;s family and not from one&#x27;s own achievements or wealth. Much of the population that composed the upper class consisted of aristocrats, ruling families, titled people, and religious hierarchs. These people were usually born into their status and historically there was not much movement across class boundaries.
In many countries, the term &quot;upper class&quot; was intimately associated with hereditary land ownership. Political power was often in the hands of the landowners in many pre-industrial societies despite there being no legal barriers to land ownership for other social classes. Upper-class landowners in Europe were often also members of the titled nobility, though not necessarily: the prevalence of titles of nobility varied widely from country to country. Some upper classes were almost entirely untitled, for example, the Szlachta of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
In Great Britain and Ireland, the &quot;upper class&quot; traditionally comprised the landed gentry and the aristocracy of noble families with hereditary titles. The vast majority of post-medieval aristocratic families originated in the merchant class and were ennobled between the 14th and 19th centuries while intermarrying with the old nobility and gentry. Since the Second World War, the term has come to encompass rich and powerful members of the managerial and professional classes as well. In the years since Irish independence in 1922 the upper class has all but vanished in the Republic of Ireland. Aristocratic titles within the Peerage of Ireland granted by the British monarch have no recognition in the Irish Constitution. Contemporary Ireland is generally perceived to have a two-tier social class system composed of working class and middle class (with the exception of a small number of wealthy billionaires).

==United States==
The American upper class is a social group within the United States consisting of people who have the highest social rank primarily due to economic wealth. The American upper class is estimated to constitute less than 1% of the population. By self-identification, according to this 2001‚Äì2012 Gallup Poll data, 98% of Americans identify with the five other class terms used, 48‚Äì50% identifying as &quot;middle class&quot;.

The main distinguishing feature of the upper class is its ability to derive enormous incomes from wealth through techniques such as money management and investing, rather than engaging in wage-labor salaried employment, although most upper-class individuals today will still hold some sort of employment, which differs from historical norms. Successful entrepreneurs, CEOs, investment bankers, venture capitalists, heir to fortunes, celebrities, and a few number of professionals, are considered members of this class by contemporary sociologists, such as James Henslin or Dennis Gilbert. There may be prestige differences between different upper-class households. An A-list actor, for example, might not be accorded as much prestige as a former U.S. President, yet all members of this class are so influential and wealthy as to be considered members of the upper class. At the pinnacle of U.S. wealth, 2004 saw a dramatic increase in the numbers of billionaires. According to &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot;, there are now 374 U.S. billionaires. The growth in billionaires took a dramatic leap since the early 1980s, when the average net worth of the individuals on the Forbes 400 list was $400 million. Today, the average net worth is $2.8 billion.
Since the 1970s, income inequality in the United States has been increasing, with the top 1% (largely because of the top 0.1%) experiencing significantly larger gains in income than the rest of society. Alan Greenspan, former chair of the Federal Reserve, sees it as a problem for society, calling it a &quot;very disturbing trend&quot;.

According to the book &quot;Who Rules America?&quot; by William Domhoff, the distribution of wealth in America is the primary highlight of the influence of the upper class. The top 1% of Americans own around 34% of the wealth in the U.S. while the bottom 80% own only approximately 16% of the wealth. This large disparity displays the unequal distribution of wealth in America in absolute terms.

In 1998, Bob Herbert of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to modern American plutocrats as &quot;The Donor Class&quot; (list of top donors) and defined the class, for the first time, as &quot;a tiny group ‚Äì just one-quarter of 1 percent of the population ‚Äì and it is not representative of the rest of the nation. But its money buys plenty of access.&quot;

Jacky Cheung Hok-yau (born 10 July 1961) is a Hong Kong singer and actor. Cheung is widely regarded as a Heavenly King of Cantopop music and an icon of Hong Kong popular culture. He is often dubbed as the &quot;God of Songs&quot; for his vocal delivery and live performances.

Cheung&#x27;s accolades include the World Music Award (1996) for the World&#x27;s Best-Selling Asian Artist, the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award (1994) for Most Popular Asian Singer, and a &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the largest combined audience for a live act in 12 months (2,048,553 audience members). In 1999, Cheung was honored by Junior Chamber International as one of the Ten Outstanding Young People in the World.

Cheung is the best-selling music artist of all time in Taiwan and Hong Kong, with album sales exceeding 25 to 60 million records worldwide. His A Classic Tour (2016‚Äì2019) ranks among the most-attended concert tours of all time, drawing more than 4.5 million people. In addition, two of the singer&#x27;s other concert tours have each attracted over 2 million people.

== Early life ==
Cheung was born and grew up in Quarry Bay in the eastern part of Hong Kong Island. His father is from Tianjin and his mother is from Shanghai. As a child, he lived with his parents and two siblings in a 100 square feet apartment which they simultaneously shared with at least fifteen other relatives. He attended North Point Government Primary School from 1967 to 1973, and graduated from Literary College in 1978.

In 2007, Cheung revealed that the paternal side of his family are mostly seamen, including his father, paternal cousin, and older brother. His first language is Cantonese, but he also speaks Mandarin and English. He sings Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and modern English pop songs. Cheung is known for his rich baritone voice, but also his dramatic vibrato by rapidly moving his pronounced Adam&#x27;s Apple.

== Musical career ==
Cheung originally started working as a reservation officer for the airline Cathay Pacific. His music career started when he won the Amateur 18-Hong Kong district singing contest in 1984 with the song &quot;Fatherland&quot; () by Michael Kwan. He outcompeted more than 10,000 other contestants. After winning the contest, he was signed by the then Polygram Records, now Universal Music Group. Although encouraged by a bright start, he did not achieve immediate supremacy in Cantopop, then dominated by Leslie Cheung, Alan Tam, Anita Mui and Danny Chan. In 1985, he won his first two major awards together with the 1985 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards and the 1985 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards. From 1985 to 1998, he won the Top 10 Songs award from Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards every year, except in 1988.

In 1991, he released the song &quot;Loving You More Every Day&quot; (), a translated version of the Japanese Southern All Stars hit &quot;Midsummer&#x27;s Fruit&quot; (). The album &quot;True Love Expression&quot; () in 1992, as well as the subsequent release, &quot;Love Sparks&quot; () in 1992, achieved sales of over 400,000 copies in Hong Kong alone.

His subsequent albums included 1993 &quot;Me and You&quot; () and 1994 &quot;Born to be Wild&quot; (). In 1994, Billboard Music Awards named him the most popular singer in Asia. He received numerous music awards both in Hong Kong and elsewhere, including the best-selling Asian artist in the World Music Awards for two consecutive years in 1995 and 1996 held at Monaco.

Amongst his hit songs, some of his most famous were &quot;Amour&quot;, &quot;Just want to spend my life with you&quot; () and &quot;Goodbye Kiss&quot; (). The 1993 album &quot;The Goodbye Kiss&quot; () is one of the best-selling Chinese music albums of all time, achieving more sales in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia than ever attained before, with more than 5 million copies sold in 1993, making him one of PolyGram&#x27;s top 10 artists worldwide that year. It made him the first singer with non-Taiwanese citizenship to win Taiwan&#x27;s Golden Melody Awards. The album was also instrumental in helping Cheung break into the mandopop market. Due to these great songs and albums, Cheung is generally considered to be the pre-eminent member of the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantopop. He is regarded by some sources as the best singer of the four.

In 1995, Cheung staged his record-breaking 100-show world tour titled &quot;Yau Hok Yau&quot; (), literally a pun of &quot;friendship Jacky Cheung&quot; reusing the same Chinese characters found in his name. The tour started with 34 shows from 8 April to 9 June at the Hong Kong Coliseum. Then the tour continued in Perth and Brisbane, Australia and returned to Taipei and mainland China. It then expanded to Madison Square Garden in the US, different parts of Europe, Singapore, India, Malaysia and Japan. In 1997, Cheung was named best-selling Chinese singer in the world by &quot;Time&quot;, which reported record sales of more than 25 million worldwide.

In 1999, he was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World by JCI (Junior Chamber International), a worldwide federation of young professionals and entrepreneurs. In 2000 he was awarded the Golden Needle Award by RTHK. This award, the equivalent of a lifetime achievement award, recognised outstanding contributions to the music industry. He expressed his astonishment upon receiving the award, as he was the least experienced living recipient at only 16 years, and this award was awarded to singers, producers and lyricists that are late in their careers or are semi-retired, in which he was not, but to quash any negative publicity, he clarified that according to his research, there was no stipulation of this sort.

In 2004, Cheung released &quot;Life Is Like A Dream&quot;, an album in which Jacky co-produced with long-time collaborative partner Michael Au, and Jacky composed the melody for all songs, and penned the lyrics for 3 of the songs.

Cheung won the Best Selling Cantonese Album Award at the Hong Kong IFPI Awards in 2005 with his live album, &quot;Jacky Live Performance&quot;, which he accepted in person for the first time in years. This is despite poor ticket sales for the reason that the concert was meant to be a one-night-only charity concert in nature, and Jacky attempted to sing a song by other artists for the first time. In the fast-changing scene of canto-pop, Cheung has maintained his popularity and sales power for more than 20 years after his debut, an incredible feat in Hong Kong pop music.

In 2007, Cheung staged his Year of Jacky Cheung World Tour 2007. The tour started on 18 February 2007 at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. When the tour ended in Hong Kong on 3 February 2008 after touring 58 cities around the world, a total of 105 shows had been given, attracting more than 2¬†million fans. 105 became the highest number of shows in a tour by a Chinese artist, breaking the previous record of 100, which was also set by Cheung previously. In that same year, he also released a Mandopop album, &quot;By Your Side&quot;, in which he was the sole executive producer of the album for the first time after Michael Au suddenly left to further his career in Beijing.
In 2009, Cheung recorded &quot;Private Corner&quot;, his first jazz album for which he coined the phrase &quot;Canto-jazz&quot;. The album was produced by Andrew Tuason. &quot;Everyday Is Christmas&quot;, &quot;Which Way, Robert Frost?&quot;, &quot;Let It Go&quot;, &quot;Lucky in Love&quot; and &quot;Double Trouble&quot; were co-written by Roxanne Seeman in collaboration with Tuason, tailor-made for Cheung. &quot;Lucky in Love&quot; is the end-credit song of &quot;Crossing Hennessy&quot;, Hong Kong movie starring Jacky Cheung and Tang Wei, produced by Bill Kong. Nokia&#x27;s music download service website (Ovi.com) announced that &quot;Everyday Is Christmas&quot; was the 10th most downloaded Christmas song in the world in 2010, joining classic hits such as Wham&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot; and Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;All I Want for Christmas is You&quot;. Cheung is the only Chinese language singer to make it into the Top Ten.

In 2010, Cheung started his Jacky Cheung 1/2 Century World Tour. This tour started on 30 December 2010 at Shanghai, and ended in Hong Kong on 30 May 2012. For 1 year and 5 months, his tour included 5 countries 77 cities, overall 146 shows, more than 2,800,000 audiences. 146 became the highest number of shows in a one tour by Chinese artist. Previous record of 105 was also made by Jacky Cheung on his 2007‚Äì2008 World Tour. Both 2007 and 2010 World tour was led by Andrew Tuason as Cheung&#x27;s Musical Director. At the beginning of that year, he also attempted new musical styles. His new album, &quot;Private Corner&quot;, became his first ever Jazz album in Cantopop history, it also featured other non-mainstream Cantopop styles such as strings quartet, Waltz and Hymn. The special edition also featured a special glass-CD, also a first in Chinese pop history. &quot;Double Trouble&quot; from &quot;Private Corner&quot; was a featured produced number in the Jacky Cheung 1/2 Century World Tour.
For the Jacky Cheung 1/2 Century World Tour, he set a Guinness World record for the largest combined audience for a live act in 12 months, with 2,048,553 audience members. During the first 12 months of the tour, which ran from 30 December 2010 to 29 December 2011, there were 105 live concerts in 61 cities across China, USA, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. Cheung won the 35th Anniversary Golden Song Award at the 2012 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards, as he has the greatest number of RTHK Golden Songs since the award has been started.

In 2018, he earned a new nickname of &quot;Fugitive Bait&quot; or &quot;Fugitives&#x27; Krytonite&quot; in China as his concerts attracted wanted criminals in China to purchase tickets to watch his concerts in China. He helped to bring 4 wanted criminals to be captured between April and June 2018 during Cheung&#x27;s Chinese leg of the world tour. In June, two ticket scalpers were also captured. This was also part of his 233-show, &quot;Jacky Cheung A Classic Tour&quot; world tour, which eclipses the previous tour record. The entire tour, which lasted for 27 months with performances in 97 cities, ended on 29 January 2019 after a series of 15 concerts in Hong Kong.

<text>The Dandy was a Scottish children&#x27;s comic magazine published by the Dundee based publisher DC Thomson. The first issue was printed in December 1937, making it the world&#x27;s third-longest running comic, after &quot;Il Giornalino&quot; (cover dated 1 October 1924) and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (cover dated March 1937). From August 2007 until October 2010, it was rebranded as &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot;.

One of the best selling comics in the UK, along with &quot;The Beano&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot; reached sales of two million a week in the 1950s. The final printed edition was issued on 4 December 2012, the comic&#x27;s 75th anniversary, after sales slumped to 8,000 a week. On the same day, &quot;The Dandy&quot; relaunched as an online comic, The Digital Dandy, appearing on the Dandy website and in the Dandy App. The digital relaunch was not successful and the comic ended just six months later. The Dandy title continues as a yearly Summer Special and the unbroken run of Dandy Annuals, up to and including the 2026 annual.

==History==
The first issue, under the name &quot;The Dandy Comic&quot;, was published on 4 December 1937. The most notable difference between this and other comics of the day was the use of speech balloons instead of captions under the . It was published weekly until 6 September 1941, when wartime paper shortages forced it to change to fortnightly, alternating with &quot;The Beano&quot;. It returned to weekly publication on 30 July 1949. From 17 July 1950 the magazine changed its name to &quot;The Dandy.&quot; One of those involved in the comic in its early days was George Thomson, who served as deputy editor, and briefly - when aged 18 - as editor. Thomson would later serve as a cabinet minister under Harold Wilson and as European Commissioner.

In 1938, less than a year after the comic&#x27;s debut, the first &quot;Dandy Annual&quot; was released. Originally called The Dandy Monster comic, this was an annual bumper edition of the comic and has been released annually since then. In 1954 the first &quot;Desperate Dan Book&quot; was released, mostly consisting of reprints. Another was released in 1978, and it was released yearly between 1990 and 1992. Bananaman and Black Bob also had their own annuals.

Although later issues were all comic strips, early issues had many text strips, with some illustrations. In 1940, this meant 12 pages of comic strips and 8 pages of text stories. Text stories at two pages each were &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Pocket Grandpa&quot;, &quot;British Boys and Girls Go West&quot;, &quot;There&#x27;s a Curse on the King&quot; and &quot;Swallowed by a Whale!&quot;

In 1963 the first &quot;Dandy&quot; summer special was published, a joint &quot;Dandy-The Beano summer special&quot;; the first exclusively &quot;Dandy Summer Special&quot; was released the following year.

In 1982 the Dandy comic libraries were released, which later became known as the &quot;Fun Size Dandy&quot;. These were small-format comics usually featuring one or two long stories starring characters from &quot;The Dandy&quot; and occasionally other DC Thomson comics.

In September 1985, the ailing &quot;Nutty&quot; was merged with &quot;The Dandy&quot;, bringing with it the Bananaman strip. Just over a year later, the short-lived &quot;Hoot&quot; was also merged with &quot;The Dandy&quot;, most notably incorporating the character Cuddles into the pre-existing comic strip Dimples to form Cuddles and Dimples, another of &quot;The Dandy&quot;&#x27;s longest running comic strips.

After issue 3282 (dated 16 October 2004) &quot;The Dandy&quot; underwent a radical format overhaul. The comic changed format and content, reflecting a more television-oriented style, now printed on glossy magazine paper instead of gravure. The price was raised from 70p to ¬£1.20 (99p for the first two weeks), a new comic strip called &quot;Office Hours&quot; (a comic strip about the adventures of the writers of &quot;The Dandy&quot;) appeared, and two supposedly new ones also started, though they were actually revivals from a few years earlier (&quot;Jak&quot; and &quot;Dreadlock Holmes&quot;).

In August 2007 (issue 3426), &quot;The Dandy&quot; had another update, becoming the fortnightly comic-magazine hybrid &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot;, priced at ¬£2.50. Unlike previous incarnations, &quot;Dandy&quot; characters did not necessarily grace the cover every issue; instead, celebrities and other cartoon characters were featured; the first &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot; had Bart Simpson on the cover. The &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot; had a theme for each issue, usually a film or TV show.
From 27 October 2010 (issue 3508) &quot;The Dandy&quot; returned as a weekly comic and dropped &quot;Xtreme&quot; from its title. The contents received a major overhaul, and all the comic strips from the &quot;Xtreme&quot; era except for Desperate Dan, Bananaman and The Bogies were dropped. Bananaman was also taken over by a new artist, Wayne Thompson, and Korky the Cat, who appeared in the comic&#x27;s first issue in 1937, made a return drawn by Phil Corbett. Korky&#x27;s strip was changed from 1‚Äì2 pages to 3 panels, to make way for new comics. Many new celebrity spoofs such as Cheryl&#x27;s Mole became a feature, but other new strips included Pre-Skool Prime Minister and George vs Dragon, drawn by Jamie Smart and Andy Fanton. The 76-page Christmas special featured a pantomime, a 12-page Harry Hill strip, free gifts, and the return of some characters. More recent new strips are &quot;Punslinger&quot;, &quot;Dad&#x27;s Turn To Cook&quot;, &quot;My Freaky Family&quot;, &quot;Animals Eat The Funniest Things&quot;, &quot;Star T.Rex&quot; and &quot;Brian Damage&quot;. Song parodies and fake recipes also appeared in &quot;The Dandy&quot;.

On 19 March 2012 the Royal Mail launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain&#x27;s rich comic book history, which included &quot;The Dandy&quot; among many others.

A follow-up to Waverly Book&#x27;s &quot;The History of The Beano: The Story So Far&quot;, called &quot;The Art and History of The Dandy&quot;, was released in August 2012, the Dandy&#x27;s 75th anniversary year. A Waverly book about &quot;The Dandy&quot; was originally to be released in 2007 for the comic&#x27;s 70th birthday, but was cancelled with no explanation. The last print edition of the Dandy, a 100-page edition featuring a countdown of the comic&#x27;s &quot;Top 75 Characters&quot;, was published on 4 December 2012.

However, The Dandy continued online and in the Dandy App, with long-running characters like &quot;Desperate Dan&quot;, &quot;Bananaman&quot;, &quot;Blinky&quot;, &quot;Sneaker&quot; and &quot;Hyde &amp; Shriek&quot; making the transition to digital alongside a re-imagined version of &quot;Keyhole Kate&quot; ‚Äì transformed from nosey parker into a schoolgirl sleuth ‚Äì a new take on former &quot;Beezer&quot; characters &quot;The Numskulls&quot;, and a superhero team consisting of revamped versions of former D.C. Thomson action stars ‚Äì including The Dandy&#x27;s (and the U.K.&#x27;s) first ever superhero, &quot;The Amazing Mr X&quot; ‚Äì in adventure serial &quot;Retro-Active&quot;.

This was quite controversial among most Dandy fans as comparisons were made that the print edition was better and the digital one could be quite unreliable. DC Thomson decided to axe the comic as it didn&#x27;t ultimately attract the publicity and customers that the company initially wanted. It ended on 26 June 2013, although annuals and occasional summer specials continue to be published.

==Editors==
The original editor was Albert Barnes, who according to &quot;The Legend of Desperate Dan&quot; (1997) was the model for Dan&#x27;s famous chin. Barnes remained in the role until 1982, when he was succeeded by Dave Torrie. His replacement, Morris Heggie, left the editorship in 2006 to become the DC Thomson archivist. The final editor of the print edition was Craig Graham. The editor of the digital version launched in 2012 was Craig Ferguson.

==Dandy comic strips==
Over its 75-year run hundreds of different comic strips have appeared in &quot;The Dandy&quot;, many of them for a very long time. The longest-running strips are Desperate Dan and Korky the Cat, who both appeared in the first issue. Following mergers with &quot;Nutty&quot; and &quot;Hoot&quot;, the Dandy inherited a number of their strips, most notably Bananaman from Nutty and Cuddles from Hoot, who teamed up with a &quot;Dandy&quot; character to form a new strip entitled Cuddles and Dimples. Both have been quite long-running, having been in the &quot;Dandy&quot; since the 1980s and each having appeared on the front cover of both &quot;The Dandy&quot; and the comics from which they originated. After the closure of &quot;The Beezer&quot; and &quot;The Topper&quot;, &quot;The Dandy&quot; inherited some of its strips as well, including Beryl the Peril, Puss &#x27;n&#x27; Boots (who had been in &quot;Sparky&quot; before being moved to &quot;The Topper&quot;) and Owen Goal (who appeared in &quot;Nutty&quot; under a different title).

The comic has had a number of different cover stars (comic strips appearing on the front cover), firstly Korky the Cat, who was on the cover from 1937 to 1984. Desperate Dan, long since the comic&#x27;s most popular character, then took over the cover, a position he retained until 1999 when he was replaced as cover star by Cuddles and Dimples. However, they were not on the cover for very long and Desperate Dan had been restored to the cover by the end of 2000. The comic revealed that Cuddles and Dimples were thrown off the cover for &quot;being too naughty&quot;, though in reality the comic&#x27;s readers wanted Dan to return as the cover strip. In 2004, following a major revamp, Desperate Dan was replaced on the front cover by Jak, a character created for the cover, slightly based on an older strip with the same name, although other characters, including Dan, also made occasional cover appearances. The front cover also had a subtitle, for example, &quot;Better than the Beano&quot;. During the &quot;Dandy Xtreme&quot; era the comic had no cover star, and covers were often given over to celebrities or current trends, but after the comic returned to its weekly, all-comic format in October 2010, the popular British comedian Harry Hill took over the cover spot, accompanied by Desperate Dan and Bananaman in some issues (although other characters made one-off appearances too).

There were frequent fictional crossovers between &quot;Dandy&quot; characters, as most of the characters lived in the fictional Dandytown, just as the characters in &quot;The Beano&quot; were portrayed as living in Beanotown. Many of the comic strips in &quot;The Beano&quot; are drawn by the same artists, and crossovers between the two comics occur occasionally. Quite often, one comic would make a tongue-in-cheek jibe at the other (e.g. a character meeting an elderly lady and stating that she&#x27;s &quot;older than the jokes in &quot;The Beano&quot;&quot;). In the strips, it was expressed that Dandytown and Beanotown are rivals, &quot;The Dandy&quot; did a drastic format change when Dandytown had an embassy in Beanotown, which many of the town&#x27;s citizens unsuccessfully attempted to overrun¬†‚Äì the embassy was never referred to in &quot;The Beano&quot;. This rivalry inspired the spin-off computer game &quot;Beanotown Racing&quot;, in which various characters from both comics could be raced around points in Beanotown, including the embassy. The game was given a great deal of advance publicity in the comics, with story lines often revolving around how each of the characters acquired his or her vehicle.

==Dundee==

Thanks to &quot;The Dandy&quot;, &quot;The Beano&quot; and other D C Thomson comics which followed, Dundee gained a reputation as a major centre of the comics industry, and has been called the &#x27;comic capital of Britain&#x27;. Partly as a result of this legacy, the city is now home to the Scottish Centre for Comic Studies. The connection is also marked by bronze statues of Desperate Dan and &quot;The Beano&quot; character Minnie the Minx installed in the city&#x27;s High Street in 2001. Designed by Tony Morrow, the Desperate Dan statue, which also features his dog Dawg, is the most photographed of 120 pieces of public art in the city. In July 2001 the cover of &quot;The Dandy&quot; featured Dan visiting Dundee and encountering his statue. In December 2012 the University of Dundee held an exhibition in partnership with D C Thomson to mark the comic&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

<text>The Territory of Arizona, commonly known as the Arizona Territory, was a territory of the United States that existed from February 24, 1863, until February 14, 1912, when the remaining extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the state of Arizona. It was created from the western half of the New Mexico Territory during the American Civil War.

==History==
Following the expansion of the New Mexico Territory in 1853, as a result of the Gadsden Purchase, several proposals for a division of the territory and the organization of a separate Territory of Arizona in the southern half of the territory were advanced as early as 1856. These proposals arose from concerns about the ability of the territorial government in Santa Fe to effectively administer the newly acquired southern portions of the territory.
The first proposal dates from a conference held in Tucson that convened on August 29, 1856. The conference issued a petition to the U.S. Congress, signed by 256 people, requesting organization of the territory and elected Nathan P. Cook as the territorial delegate to Congress. In January 1857, the bill for the organization of the territory was introduced into the House of Representatives, but the proposal was defeated on the grounds that the population of the proposed territory was as yet too small. Later, a similar proposal was defeated in the Senate. The proposal for creation of the territory was controversial in part because of the perception that the New Mexico Territory was under the influence of southern sympathizers who were highly desirous of expanding slavery into the southwest.

In February 1858, the New Mexico territorial legislature adopted a resolution in favor of the creation of the Arizona territory, but with a north‚Äìsouth border along the 109th meridian, with the additional stipulation that all the Indians of New Mexico would be removed to northern Arizona.

In April 1860, impatient for Congress to act, a convention of 31 delegates met in Tucson and adopted a constitution for a provisional territorial government of the area south of 34¬∞N. The delegates elected Dr. Lewis S. Owings as provisional governor.

===American Civil War===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, sentiment in the territory was in favor of the Confederacy. Territorial secession conventions called at Mesilla and Tucson in March 1861 adopted an ordinance of secession, established a provisional Arizona Territory with Owings as its governor, and petitioned the Confederate Congress for admission.

The Confederacy regarded the territory as a valuable route for possible access to the Pacific Ocean, with the specific intention of capturing California. In July 1861, a small Confederate force of Texans under the command of Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor assaulted Fort Fillmore at Mesilla in the eastern part of the territory. After the fort was abandoned by the Union garrison, Baylor&#x27;s force cut off the fleeing Union troops and forced them to surrender. On August 1, 1861, Baylor issued a &quot;Proclamation to the People of the Territory of Arizona&quot;, taking possession of the territory for the Confederacy, with Mesilla as the capital and himself as the governor, establishing Confederate Arizona. Baylor&#x27;s subsequent dismantling of the existing Union forts in the territory left the white settlers at the mercy of the Apache, who quickly gained control of the area and forced many of the white settlers to seek refuge in Tucson.

On August 28, a convention met again in Tucson and declared that the territory formed the previous year was part of the Confederacy. Granville H. Oury was elected as delegate to the Confederate Congress. Oury drafted legislation authorizing the organization of the Confederate Territory of Arizona. The legislation passed on January 13, 1862, and the territory was officially created by proclamation of President Jefferson Davis on February 14.

The following month, in March 1862, the U.S. House of Representatives, now devoid of the southern delegates and controlled by Republicans, passed a bill to create the United States Arizona Territory using the north‚Äìsouth border of the 109th meridian. The use of a north‚Äìsouth border rather than an east‚Äìwest one had the effect of denying a &quot;de facto&quot; ratification of the Confederate Arizona Territory. The house bill stipulated that Tucson was to be the capital. The final bill passed the Senate in February 1863 without the Tucson-as-capital stipulation, and was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on February 24, the date of the official organization of the U.S. Arizona Territory.

==Capital==
The first capital was established in 1864 at Prescott, in the northern Union-controlled area. The capital was moved to Tucson in 1868, and back to Prescott in 1877. The capital was finally moved to Phoenix on February 4, 1889.

==Boundary==

The boundaries for the original territory, if they had kept their same size, would have made present-day Las Vegas part of Arizona. In 1867, though, Congress transferred the Arizona Territory&#x27;s northwestern corner, specifically most of its land west of the Colorado River, to the state of Nevada. This reduced the territory to its current area.

==Statehood==
The territory was admitted to the Union as the 48th state on February 14, 1912.

==Territorial proclamation==
Proclamation to the People of Arizona.

<text>Mini-Tuesday was the name given to the February 3, 2004 U.S. presidential primary where several states, which to that point had participated in &quot;Super Tuesday,&quot; cast their votes for the Presidential nominees of the 2004 Presidential election. &quot;Mini-Tuesday&quot; was also called Super Tuesday I (with the March Super Tuesday called &quot;Super Tuesday II&quot;, in reference to their respective chronological order). With the large number of states moving their election dates up to Mini-Tuesday for the 2008 election cycle, pundits have largely shied away from using the term again, instead choosing to reappropriate the term &quot;Super Tuesday&quot; to better represent the primaries held on that approximate date. The date is also known as &quot;Super Duper Tuesday,&quot; &quot;Giga Tuesday,&quot; and &quot;Tsunami Tuesday,&quot; among others, with the term &quot;Mini Tuesday&quot; falling to apparent disuse for the time being.

In 2004, U.S. presidential primary elections occurred in Missouri, South Carolina, Arizona, Oklahoma and Delaware. Presidential caucuses were held in New Mexico and North Dakota. The Republican primaries and caucuses were virtually uncontested as incumbent President George W. Bush faced no substantial opposition. The Democratic primaries and caucuses were contested between retired General Wesley Clark of Arkansas, former Governor Howard Dean of Vermont, Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, Congressman Dennis Kucinich of Ohio, Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, and the Reverend Al Sharpton of New York. Of the seven Democratic primaries contested, five were won by Kerry, reinforcing his status as frontrunner for the 2004 nomination.

==2004 Results==

===Missouri===

Kerry handily won the biggest prize of the day by securing 51% of the vote in Missouri. Edwards placed second with 25%. All other candidates were in the single digits.

<text>The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota and the western portion became unorganized territory and shortly after was reorganized as part of the Dakota Territory.

==History==


The Minnesota Territory was formed on March 3, 1849, encompassing the entirety of the present-day state of Minnesota and the majority portions of modern-day North and South Dakota east of the Missouri and White Earth Rivers. At the time of formation there were an estimated 5,000 settlers living in the Territory. There were no roads from adjoining Wisconsin or Iowa. The easiest access to the region was via waterway, of which the Mississippi River was primary. 
The primary mode of transport was the riverboat.

Minnesota Territory had three significant pioneer settlements: St. Paul, St. Anthony/Minneapolis, and Stillwater, plus two military reservations: Fort Snelling and Fort Ripley. All of these were located on waterways. A reservation for the Winnebago people had been created at Long Prairie in 1848. The Chippewa Agency, at Crow Wing, was founded in 1852. The Upper and Lower Sioux Agencies were created in 1853. All of these were also located adjacent to waterways. The primary territorial institutions were in the three main settlements. St. Paul was made the territorial capital, Minneapolis was selected as the site of the University of Minnesota, and Stillwater was chosen for the Territorial Prison. The military reservations were federal land, of which the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory still exists. Fort Ripley is now the Minnesota National Guard&#x27;s Camp Ripley. The first school in the Territory was located at Fort Snelling, as was the first Post Office. The first justice of the peace in Minnesota was at Mendota, as was the first church, St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church, which was built in 1840.

The first territorial governor, Alexander Ramsey, requested that Congress approve funds for five military roads in the Territory: Mendota/Fort Snelling to the confluence of the Big Sioux River with the Missouri River; Point Douglas to Fort Ripley; Fort Ripley Road/Swan River to Long Prairie Indian Agency; and Point Douglas to Superior. A budget was approved in 1850 for four of these roads, with the Point Douglas‚ÄìFort Ripley Military Road being the first. Additional funds were later appropriated for a survey of the route to the Big Sioux/Missouri, the Fort Ridgely and South Pass Wagon Road and the Wagon Road from Fort Ripley to Fort Abercrombie. Private trails were cut as well, the most well known of which was Dodd Road from 1853. It was named after its builder, Captain William B. Dodd, and significant portions of it still exist.

When the region was still part of the Wisconsin Territory, the Red River Trails were further developed by Joe Rolette. There were three main trails, now identified as the West Plains Trail, East Plains Trail, and Woods Trails. They connected Fort Garry and the Selkirk Settlement in British North America with Fort Snelling and the American Fur Trading Company at Mendota. Later, the Oxcarts became synonymous with St. Paul&#x27;s Kellogg Street and the riverboat landing on the Mississippi River. Fort Ripley lay along the East Plains Trail.

In 1850, 10 years after the end of the Second Great Awakening (1790‚Äì1840), of the three churches with regular services in the Minnesota Territory, 1 was Methodist, 1 was Presbyterian, and 1 was Catholic. The Roman Catholic diocese of Saint Paul of Minnesota was established by Pope Pius IX on July 19, 1850, and consisted of the entirety of the Minnesota Territory. Because of this original territorial designation, to this day the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis continues to oversee the Catholic dioceses in the Dakotas within its ecclesiastical province.

<doc id="454195" wikidata="Q116293563" url="?curid=454195" title="Movietone News">
<text>Movietone News was a newsreel that ran from December 1927 to 1963 in the United States. Under the name British Movietone News, it also ran in the United Kingdom from 1929 to 1986, in France also produced by Fox-Europa, in Spain in the early 1930s as Noticiario Fox Movietone before being replaced by No-Do, in Australia and New Zealand until 1970, and Germany as Fox T√∂nende Wochenschau from 1930 to 1940 and from 1950 to 1978. An Indian version called Indian Movietone News ran in 1942 and 1943 before getting replaced by Indian News Parade.

==History==

Movietone News evolved from an earlier newsreel established by Fox Films called Fox News which was founded in 1919. It produced silent newsreels. When Fox entered talkies in 1928 with &quot;Mother Knows Best&quot;, the name Fox Movietone was applied to Fox&#x27;s sound productions.

In the U.S. as Fox Movietone News it produced cinema sound newsreels from December 1927 to 1963, and from 1929 to 1986 in the UK (for much of that time as British Movietone News), as well as 1929 to 1975 in Australia. One of the earliest in the series featured &quot;George Bernard Shaw Talks to Movietone News&quot;, released on June 25, 1928.

One of the known early producers of these newsreels was Abraham Harrison also known as Harry, father of notable black and white photographer Dody Weston Thompson who also found a brief career in film making.

An early conductor of the Movietone News orchestra was Harry Lauder II, nephew of entertainer Sir Harry Lauder, who was contracted by the company for eighteen months before William Fox took him to his Hollywood studio. Sir Harry Lauder also appeared in test sound films made at the Fox Studios in New York City during the winter-spring of 1927.

One installment, &quot;Fox Grandeur News&quot;, was released on May 26, 1929, in Fox&#x27;s short-lived widescreen process Grandeur and shown before the feature film &quot;Fox Movietone Follies of 1929&quot;.

&quot;Hearst Metrotone News&quot; initially leased the Case Research Lab patents from William Fox for its sound newsreels. Each of these studios used this system of recording sound film for news items because it was an easily transported single-system of sound-on-film recording.

Fox&#x27;s first use of recording a news event was on May 20, 1927: Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s take-off from Roosevelt Field for his historic solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean was filmed with sound and shown in a New York theater that same night, inspiring Fox to create Movietone News. A regular narrator of the newsreels was broadcaster/journalist Lowell Thomas.

After Fox Films merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935 to form 20th Century-Fox (Later 20th Century Studios in 2020), the name of Fox Movietone News was shortened to Movietone News.

The company&#x27;s last regular broadcast occurred in 1963, although it existed as a legal entity set to preserve important filmreels until Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s acquisition of the parent company 20th Century Fox and the subsequent liquidation of Movietone in 1984 and 1986 respectively.

In Australia, Movietone and Cinesound were competitors for newsreel coverage, but later combined under the Australian Movie Magazine name.

==Status and licensing==
The University of South Carolina Moving Image Research Collections has a portion of the Fox Movietone newsreel collection. The rest of it is owned and managed by the Fox Film Corporation&#x27;s corporate successor (and namesake), Fox News Channel. During its early years, Fox News Channel had a weekend show which played the newsreels.

Licensing for Fox Movietone newsreels owned by the University of South Carolina is handled by the Moving Image Research Collections while licensing for Fox Movietone News is still owned by Fox Corporation and handled by Fox News Channel. British Movietone is owned separately by the films&#x27; successor-in-interest, operating under the name British Movietonews Ltd. The licensing of British Movietone newsreels is handled by AP Archive.

In September 2016, it was announced that the British Movietone archive had been acquired by Associated Press.

The Movietone News Australia archive was donated to the National Film and Sound Archive in 1988.

==Archive==
The Academy Film Archive houses the 20th Century Fox Movietone Shorts and Documentaries Series Collection.

In 2015, British Movietone and Associated Press&#x27;s archival footage were released on YouTube.

<doc id="454196" wikidata="Q1268991" url="?curid=454196" title="Dynamic soaring">
<text>Dynamic soaring is a flying technique used to gain energy by repeatedly crossing the boundary between air masses of different velocity. Such zones of wind gradient are generally found close to obstacles and close to the surface, so the technique is mainly of use to birds and operators of radio-controlled gliders, but glider pilots are sometimes able to soar dynamically in meteorological wind shears at higher altitudes. 

Dynamic soaring is sometimes confused with slope soaring which is a technique for achieving elevation.

==Basic mechanism==
While different flight patterns can be employed in dynamic soaring, the simplest is a closed loop across the shear layer between two airmasses in relative movement, e.g. stationary air in a valley, and a layer of wind above the valley. The gain in speed can be explained in terms of airspeed and groundspeed:
* As the glider begins the loop, say in a stationary airmass, groundspeed and airspeed are the same.
* The glider enters the moving airmass nearly head-on, which increases the glider&#x27;s airspeed. 
* The glider then turns 180¬∞, where it is able to maintain most of its airspeed due to momentum. This must happen immediately, or groundspeed will be lost. The glider&#x27;s groundspeed, first crosswind, then downwind, as it turns, is now higher, as the tailwind has accelerated the glider.
* The loop continues with the glider re-entering the stationary airmass and turning around, maintaining the now higher airspeed and groundspeed.
* Each cycle results in higher speeds, up to a point where drag prevents additional increase. 
The energy is extracted by using the velocity difference between the two airmasses to lift the flying object to a higher altitude (or to reverse the descent respectively) after the transfer between the airmasses.
In practice, there is a turbulent mixing layer between the moving and stationary air mass. In addition, drag forces are continually slowing the plane. Since higher speed gives rise to higher drag forces, there is a maximum speed that can be attained. Typically around 10 times the windspeed for efficient glider designs.

When seabirds perform dynamic soaring, the wind gradients are much less pronounced, so the energy extraction is comparably smaller. Instead of flying in circles as glider pilots do, birds commonly execute a series of half circles in opposite directions, in a zigzag pattern. An initial climb though the gradient while facing into the wind causes it to gain airspeed. It then makes an 180¬∞ turn and dives back through the same gradient but in the downwind direction, which again causes it to gain airspeed. It then makes an 180¬∞ turn at low altitude, in the other direction, to face back up into the wind... and the cycle repeats. By repeating the manoeuvre over and over it can make progress laterally to the wind while maintaining its airspeed, which enables it to travel in a cross-wind direction indefinitely.
As drag is slowing the bird, dynamic soaring is a tradeoff between speed lost to drag, and speed gained by moving through the wind gradient. At some point, climbing higher carries no additional benefit, as the wind gradient lessens with altitude.

==Birds==

Albatrosses are particularly adept at exploiting these techniques and can travel thousands of miles using very little energy. Gulls and terns also exhibit this behaviour in flight. Birds that soar dynamically have a skeletal structure that allows them to lock their wings when they are soaring, to reduce muscle tension and effort.

Lord Rayleigh first described dynamic soaring in 1883 in the British journal &quot;Nature&quot;:

:...a bird without working his wings cannot, either in still air or in a uniform horizontal wind, maintain his level indefinitely. For a short time such maintenance is possible at the expense of an initial relative velocity, but this must soon be exhausted. Whenever therefore a bird pursues his course for some time without working his wings, we must conclude either
:#that the course is not horizontal,
:#that the wind is not horizontal, or
:#that the wind is not uniform.
:It is probable that the truth is usually represented by (1) or (2); but the question I wish to raise is whether the cause suggested by (3) may not sometimes come into operation.

The first case described above by Rayleigh is simple gliding flight, the second is static soaring (using thermals, lee waves or slope soaring), and the last is dynamic soaring.

==Manned aircraft==
In his 1975 book &quot;Streckensegelflug&quot; (published in English in 1978 as &quot;Cross-Country Soaring&quot; by the Soaring Society of America), Helmut Reichmann describes a flight made by Ingo Renner in a Glasfl√ºgel H-301 Libelle glider over Tocumwal in Australia on 24 October 1974. On that day there was no wind at the surface, but above an inversion at 300 meters there was a strong wind of about 70¬†km/h (40 knots). Renner took a tow up to about 350¬†m from where he dived steeply downwind until he entered the still air; he then pulled a 180-degree turn (with high &quot;g&quot;) and climbed back up again. On passing through the inversion he re-encountered the 70¬†km/h wind, this time as a head-wind. The additional air-speed that this provided enabled him to recover his original height. By repeating this manoeuvre he successfully maintained his height for around 20 minutes without the existence of ascending air, although he was drifting rapidly downwind. In later flights in a Pik 20 sailplane, he refined the technique so that he was able to eliminate the downwind drift and even make headway into the wind.

==Unmanned aircraft==
The dynamic soaring technique is adapted in unmanned aerial vehicles for enhancing their performance under a thrust-off condition. This improves the endurance and range of the aircraft in austere conditions.

==Spacecraft==
Dynamic soaring can be used as a means to exceed the solar wind speed, by exploiting differences in this speed near the sun, the Earth, and/or the heliopause.

==Radio-controlled gliders==

In the late 1990s, radio-controlled gliding awoke to the idea of dynamic soaring (a &quot;discovery&quot; largely credited to RC soaring luminary Joe Wurts). Radio-controlled glider pilots perform dynamic soaring using the leeward side of ground features such as ridges, saddles, or even rows of trees. If the ridge faces the wind, and has a steep back (leeward) side, it can cause flow separation off the top of the hill, resulting in a layer of fast air moving over the top of a volume of stagnant or reverse-flow air behind the hill. The velocity gradient, or wind shear, can be much greater than those used by birds or full scale sailplanes. The higher gradient allows for correspondingly greater energy extraction, resulting in much higher speeds for the aircraft. Models repeatedly cross the shear layer by flying in a circular path, penetrating a fast-moving headwind after flying up the back side, turning to fly with the wind, diving down through the shear layer into the stagnant air, and turning again to fly back up the back side of the hill. The loads caused by rapid turning at high speed (the fastest models can pull over 100 Gs) require significant structural reinforcement in the fuselage and wing. Because of this, dynamic soaring models are commonly built using composite materials.

As of February 21, 2023, the highest reported ground speed for radio control dynamic soaring was 908kph or . There is no official sanctioning organization that certifies speeds, so records are listed unofficially based on readings from radar guns, although analysis from video footage and other sources is also used. Lately, some models have begun carrying on-board telemetry and other instruments to record such things as acceleration, air speed, etc.

<text>Monocytes are a type of leukocyte or white blood cell. They are the largest type of leukocyte in blood and can differentiate into macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells. As a part of the vertebrate innate immune system monocytes also influence adaptive immune responses and exert tissue repair functions. There are at least three subclasses of monocytes in human blood based on their phenotypic receptors.

==Structure==
Monocytes are amoeboid in appearance, and have nongranulated cytoplasm. Thus they are classified as agranulocytes, although they might occasionally display some azurophil granules and/or vacuoles. With a diameter of 15‚Äì22 Œºm, monocytes are the largest cell type in peripheral blood. Monocytes are mononuclear cells and the ellipsoidal nucleus is often lobulated/indented, causing a bean-shaped or kidney-shaped appearance. Monocytes compose 2% to 10% of all leukocytes in the human body.

==Development==

Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from precursors called monoblasts, bipotent cells that differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells. Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically migrate into tissues throughout the body where they differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells.

==Subpopulations==
===In humans===
The first clear description of monocyte subsets by flow cytometry dates back to the late 1980s, when a population of CD16-positive monocytes was described. Today, three types of monocytes are recognized in human blood:
# The classical monocyte is characterized by high level expression of the CD14 cell surface receptor (CD14++ CD16‚àí monocyte)
# The non-classical monocyte shows low level expression of CD14 and additional co-expression of the CD16 receptor (CD14+CD16++ monocyte).
# The intermediate monocyte expresses high levels of CD14 and low levels of CD16 (CD14++CD16+ monocytes).

While in humans the level of CD14 expression can be used to differentiate non-classical and intermediate monocytes, the slan (6-Sulfo LacNAc) cell surface marker was shown to give an unequivocal separation of the two cell types.

Ghattas et al. state that the &quot;intermediate&quot; monocyte population is likely to be a unique subpopulation of monocytes, as opposed to a developmental step, due to their comparatively high expression of surface receptors involved in reparative processes (including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors type 1 and 2, CXCR4, and Tie-2) as well as evidence that the &quot;intermediate&quot; subset is specifically enriched in the bone marrow.

===In mice===
In mice, monocytes can be divided in two subpopulations. Inflammatory monocytes (CX3CR1low, CCR2pos, Ly6Chigh, PD-L1neg), which are equivalent to human classical CD14++ CD16‚àí monocytes and resident monocytes (CX3CR1high, CCR2neg, Ly6Clow, PD-L1pos), which are equivalent to human non-classical CD14+ CD16+ monocytes. Resident monocytes have the ability to patrol along the endothelium wall in the steady state and under inflammatory conditions.

==Function==
Monocytes are mechanically active cells and migrate from blood to an inflammatory site to perform their functions. As explained before, they can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells, but the different monocyte subpopulations can also exert specific functions on their own. In general, monocytes and their macrophage and dendritic cell progeny serve three main functions in the immune system. These are phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and cytokine production. Phagocytosis is the process of uptake of microbes and particles followed by digestion and destruction of this material. Monocytes can perform phagocytosis using intermediary (opsonising) proteins such as antibodies or complement that coat the pathogen, as well as by binding to the microbe directly via pattern recognition receptors that recognize pathogens. Monocytes are also capable of killing infected host cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Vacuolization may be present in a cell that has recently phagocytized foreign matter.

===Differentiation into other effector cells===
Monocytes can migrate into tissues and replenish resident macrophage populations. Macrophages have a high antimicrobial and phagocytic activity and thereby protect tissues from foreign substances. They are cells that possess a large smooth nucleus, a large area of cytoplasm, and many internal vesicles for processing foreign material. Although they can be derived from monocytes, a large proportion is already formed prenatally in the yolk sac and foetal liver.

&quot;In vitro&quot;, monocytes can differentiate into dendritic cells by adding the cytokines granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 4. Such monocyte-derived cells do, however, retain the signature of monocytes in their transcriptome and they cluster with monocytes and not with bona fide dendritic cells.

===Specific functions of monocyte subpopulations===

Aside from their differentiation capacity, monocytes can also directly regulate immune responses. As explained before, they are able to perform phagocytosis. Cells of the classical subpopulation are the most efficient phagocytes and can additionally secrete inflammation-stimulating factors. The intermediate subpopulation is important for antigen presentation and T lymphocyte stimulation. Briefly, antigen presentation describes a process during which microbial fragments that are present in the monocytes after phagocytosis are incorporated into MHC molecules. They are then trafficked to the cell surface of the monocytes (or macrophages or dendritic cells) and presented as antigens to activate T lymphocytes, which then mount a specific immune response against the antigen. Non-classical monocytes produce high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-12 after stimulation with microbial products. Furthermore, a monocyte patrolling behavior has been demonstrated in humans both for the classical and the non-classical monocytes, meaning that they slowly move along the endothelium to examine it for pathogens. Said et al. showed that activated monocytes express high levels of PD-1 which might explain the higher expression of PD-1 in CD14+CD16++ monocytes as compared to CD14++CD16‚àí monocytes. Triggering monocytes-expressed PD-1 by its ligand PD-L1 induces IL-10 production, which activates CD4 Th2 cells and inhibits CD4 Th1 cell function.
Many factors produced by other cells can regulate the chemotaxis and other functions of monocytes. These factors include most particularly chemokines such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2) and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7); certain arachidonic acid metabolites such as leukotriene B4 and members of the 5-hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid family of OXE1 receptor agonists (e.g., 5-HETE and 5-oxo-ETE); and N-Formylmethionine leucyl-phenylalanine and other N-formylated oligopeptides which are made by bacteria and activate the formyl peptide receptor 1.
Other microbial products can directly activate monocytes and this leads to production of pro-inflammatory and, with some delay, of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Typical cytokines produced by monocytes are TNF, IL-1, and IL-12.

==Clinical significance==

A &quot;monocyte count&quot; is part of a complete blood count and is expressed either as a percentage of monocytes among all white blood cells or as absolute numbers. Both may be useful, but these cells became valid diagnostic tools only when monocyte subsets are determined.
Monocytic cells may contribute to the severity and disease progression in COVID-19 patients.

===Monocytosis===
Monocytosis is the state of excess monocytes in the peripheral blood. It may be indicative of various disease states.
Examples of processes that can increase a monocyte count include:
* chronic inflammation
* diabetes
* stress response
* Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism)
* immune-mediated disease
* granulomatous disease
* atherosclerosis
* necrosis
* red blood cell regeneration
* viral fever
* sarcoidosis
* chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
* Resolution of fasting

A high count of CD14+CD16++ monocytes is found in severe infection (sepsis).

In the field of atherosclerosis, high numbers of the CD14++CD16+ intermediate monocytes were shown to be predictive of cardiovascular events in populations at risk.

CMML is characterized by a persistent monocyte count of &gt; 1000/microL of blood. Analysis of monocyte subsets has demonstrated predominance of classical monocytes and absence of CD14lowCD16+ monocytes. The absence of non-classical monocytes can assist in diagnosis of the disease and the use of slan as a marker can improve specificity.

===Monocytopenia===
Monocytopenia is a form of leukopenia associated with a deficiency of monocytes.
A very low count of these cells is found after therapy with immuno-suppressive glucocorticoids.

Also, non-classical slan+ monocytes are strongly reduced in patients with hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids, a neurologic disease associated with mutations in the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor gene.

<doc id="454208" wikidata="Q221109" url="?curid=454208" title="The Butterfly Effect">
<text>The Butterfly Effect is a 2004 American science fiction thriller film written and directed by Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber. It stars Ashton Kutcher, Amy Smart, Eric Stoltz, William Lee Scott, Elden Henson, Logan Lerman, Ethan Suplee, and Melora Walters. The title refers to the butterfly effect.

Kutcher plays 20-year-old college student Evan Treborn, who experiences blackouts and memory loss throughout his childhood. In his later 20s, Evan finds he can travel back in time to inhabit his former self during those periods of blackout, with his adult mind inhabiting his younger body. He attempts to change the present by changing his past behaviors and set things right for himself and his friends, but there are unintended consequences for all. The film draws heavily on flashbacks of the characters&#x27; lives at ages 7 and 13 and presents several alternative present-day outcomes as Evan attempts to change the past, before settling on a final outcome.

The film had a poor critical reception; however, it was a commercial success, generating box-office revenues of $96 million on a budget of $13 million. The film won the Pegasus Audience Award at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, and was nominated for Best Science Fiction Film at the Saturn Awards and Choice Movie: Thriller in the Teen Choice Awards, but lost to &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, another film from New Line Cinema, respectively.

==Plot==
Growing up, Evan Treborn, his friends Lenny Kagan and Kayleigh Miller, and Kayleigh&#x27;s brother Tommy suffered many severe psychological traumas that caused Evan to experience frequent amnesia. These traumas include being forced to create child pornography with Kayleigh by Tommy&#x27;s father George, Evan nearly being strangled to death by his institutionalized father Jason before Jason is killed in front of him by guards, accidentally killing a mother and her infant daughter while playing with dynamite, and Tommy burning Evan&#x27;s dog Crockett alive. Evan keeps meticulous journals of his day to day life as a coping mechanism.

Some time later, while entertaining a girl in his college dorm room, Evan discovers that he can time travel and redo parts of his past by reading his journals; his time-traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced, since those are the moments when his older self occupied his consciousness.

After a traumatized Kayleigh commits suicide, Evan travels back in time and prevents George from molesting her. He comes back to a reality where he and Kayleigh are a happy couple in college, but discovers George ended up taking out all of his abusive tendencies on Tommy, who grew up to become even more violent and dangerous. When Evan is attacked by Tommy, he kills Tommy in self defense and is imprisoned. There, he manages to time travel once more after his mother brings him a journal during a visit.

Upon returning, Evan stops Tommy from killing Crockett, but Lenny, relentlessly bullied by Tommy and mentally unstable following the dynamite incident, kills Tommy with a metal shard. Following Tommy‚Äôs death, Evan wakes up in a new reality where Lenny has been institutionalized and Kayleigh is a drug-addicted prostitute. Evan travels back to prevent the dynamite accident; while Tommy shields the mother and baby from the blast, Evan is caught directly in the explosion.

In the new reality, Lenny and Kayleigh are happily in a relationship and Tommy has become religious, but Evan is a double amputee. His mother, stricken with grief over her son&#x27;s injuries, began smoking obsessively and developed lung cancer. To save his mother and himself from this fate, Evan goes back to his childhood and prepares to discard the lit dynamite, but Kayleigh picks it up when it is smacked out of his hand by her father, and it explodes, killing her.

Evan awakens in a mental hospital and finds that his journals no longer exist and he has suffered irreversible brain damage due to the rigors of time travel. He discovers that his father had the same ability before losing the photographs that allowed him to time travel. Evan ultimately reasons that he and his friends will never have good futures as long as he keeps altering the past.

After escaping the hospital staff and barricading himself in an office, Evan uses an old home movie to travel back to the day he first met Kayleigh. He intentionally upsets her so that she and Tommy choose to live with their mother rather than their father in the wake of their parents&#x27; divorce. As a result, the siblings are not subjected to a destructive upbringing, and Lenny is never bullied.

Evan awakens in a college dorm room, where Lenny is his roommate. To ensure that his plan worked, he asks where Kayleigh is; Lenny does not know who Evan is referring to. Satisfied that his friends&#x27; futures are secure, Evan burns his journals and videos to avoid altering the past ever again.

Eight years later, in New York City, Evan and Kayleigh pass each other on the street, briefly look at each other, and continue walking.
===Director&#x27;s cut===
The director&#x27;s cut features a different ending. With his brain terribly damaged and aware that he is committed to a psychiatric facility where he will lose access to his time travel ability, Evan makes a desperate attempt to change the timeline by watching a family video, which shows his mother just before she was about to give birth to Evan. He travels back to that moment and strangles himself in the womb with his umbilical cord so as to prevent the multi-generational curse from continuing, consistent with an added scene where a psychic palm reader tells Evan &quot;you have no lifeline&quot; and that he does &quot;not belong to this world&quot;. Kayleigh is then seen as a child in the new timeline having chosen to live with her mother instead of her father, and a montage suggests that the lives of the other childhood characters have become loving and less tragic.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Critical reception for &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; was generally poor. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 33% approval rating based on 172 reviews; the rating average is 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;The premise is intriguing, but it&#x27;s placed in the service of an overwrought and tasteless thriller.&quot; On Metacritic, another review aggregator, it has a score of 30 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert wrote that he &quot;enjoyed &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, up to a point&quot; and that the &quot;plot provides a showcase for acting talent, since the actors have to play characters who go through wild swings.&quot; However, Ebert said that the scientific notion of the butterfly effect is used inconsistently: Evan&#x27;s changes should have wider reverberations. Sean Axmaker of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; called it a &quot;metaphysical mess&quot;, criticizing the film&#x27;s mechanics for being &quot;fuzzy at best and just plain sloppy the rest of the time&quot;. Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; also gave the film a negative review, stating, &quot;Normally, such a premise comes off as either intriguing or silly, but the morbid subplots (there&#x27;s prison sex, too) prevent &quot;Effect&quot; from becoming the unintentional howler it might otherwise be.&quot; Additionally, Ty Burr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; went as far as saying, &quot;whatever train-wreck pleasures you might locate here are spoiled by the vile acts the characters commit.&quot;

Matt Soergel of &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; rated it three stars out of four, writing, &quot;&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is preposterous, feverish, creepy and stars Ashton Kutcher in a dramatic role. It&#x27;s a blast... a solidly entertaining B-movie. It&#x27;s even quite funny at times...&quot; &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; said, &quot;&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; is better than you might expect despite its awkward, slow beginning, drawing you in gradually and paying off in surprisingly effective and bittersweet ways,&quot; and added that Kutcher is &quot;appealing and believable... &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; sticks to its rules fairly well... overall the film is consistent in its flights of fancy.&quot; The &quot;Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette&quot; praised it as &quot;a disturbing film&quot; and &quot;the first really interesting film of 2004,&quot; adding that Kutcher &quot;carries it off&quot;: 

In a retrospective, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that critics, including himself, were too harsh on the film at the time of its release. Describing the film as having been patronized, Bradshaw cited critical disdain for Kutcher as making the film uncool to like.

===Box office===
The film was a commercial success, earning $17,065,227 and claiming the #1 spot in its opening weekend. Against a $13 million budget, &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; grossed around $57,938,693 at the U.S. box office and $96,060,858 worldwide.

==Home media==

===Release===
The film was released on both VHS, as well as DVD as the Infinifilm edition on July 6, 2004. This edition was released with the theatrical cut (113 minutes) on one side and the director&#x27;s cut (120 minutes) on the other. The DVD also includes two documentaries (&quot;&quot;The Science and Psychology of the Chaos Theory&quot; and &quot;The History and Allure of Time Travel&quot;&quot;), a trivia subtitle track, filmmaker commentary by directors Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber, deleted and alternative scenes, and a short feature called &quot;The Creative Process&quot; among other things.

===Alternative endings===
&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; has four different endings that were shot for the film:
#The theatrical release ending shows Evan passing Kayleigh on the sidewalk, he sees her, and recognizes her, but keeps walking. She also has a brief moment of recognition but also keeps walking.
#The &quot;happy ending&quot; alternative ending shows Evan and Kayleigh stopping on the sidewalk when they cross paths. They introduce themselves and Evan asks her out for coffee.
#The &quot;open-ended&quot; alternative ending is similar to the one where Evan and Kayleigh pass each other on the sidewalk and keep walking, except this time Evan, after hesitating, turns and follows Kayleigh. This ending was utilized in the film&#x27;s novelization, written by James Swallow and published by Black Flame.
#The director&#x27;s cut ending shows Evan watching the recording of his mother giving birth to him. He proceeds to go back in time to the day when he was born and then strangles himself inside his mother&#x27;s uterus.

==Sequels==
&quot;The Butterfly Effect 2&quot; was released on DVD on October 10, 2006. It was directed by John R. Leonetti and was largely unrelated to the original film. It features a brief reference to the first film in the form of a newspaper headline referring to Evan&#x27;s father, as well as using the same basic time travel mechanics. It received a negative reception from Reel Film Reviews, which called it &quot;An abominable, pointless sequel.&quot;

The third installment in the series, &quot;The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations&quot;, was released by After Dark Films in 2009. This sequel follows the life of a young man who journeys back in time in order to solve the mystery surrounding his high school girlfriend&#x27;s death. This film has no direct relation to the first two and uses different time travel mechanics. Reel Film Reviews characterized the third installment as &quot;A very mild improvement over the nigh unwatchable &quot;Butterfly Effect 2&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="454209" wikidata="Q8023978" url="?curid=454209" title="Wind gradient">
<text>In common usage, wind gradient, more specifically wind speed gradient
or wind velocity gradient,
or alternatively shear wind,
is the vertical component of the gradient of the mean horizontal wind speed in the lower atmosphere. It is the rate of increase of wind strength with unit increase in height above ground level. In metric units, it is often measured in units of meters per second of speed, per kilometer of height¬†(m/s/km), which reduces inverse milliseconds¬†(ms‚àí1), a unit also used for shear rate.

==Simple explanation==

Surface friction forces the surface wind to slow and turn near the surface of the Earth, blowing directly towards the low pressure, when compared to the winds in the nearly frictionless flow well above the Earth&#x27;s surface. This bottom layer, where surface friction slows the wind and changes the wind direction, is known as the planetary boundary layer. Daytime solar heating due to insolation thickens the boundary layer, as air warmed by contact with the Earth&#x27;s hot surface rises up and increasingly mixes with air higher up. Radiative cooling overnight gradually decouples the winds at the surface from the winds above the boundary layer, increasing vertical wind shear near the surface, also known as wind gradient.

==Characterization==

Typically, due to aerodynamic drag, there is a wind gradient in the wind flow, especially in the first few hundred meters above the Earth&#x27;s surface‚Äîthe surface layer of the planetary boundary layer. Wind speed increases with increasing height above the ground, starting from zero due to the no-slip condition. Flow near the surface encounters obstacles that reduce the wind speed, and introduce random vertical and horizontal velocity components at right angles to the main direction of flow.
This turbulence causes vertical mixing between the air moving horizontally at various levels, which has an effect on the dispersion of pollutants, dust and airborne sand and soil particles.

The reduction in velocity near the surface is a function of surface roughness. Wind velocity profiles are quite different for different terrain types. Rough, irregular ground, and man-made obstructions on the ground, retard movement of the air near the surface, reducing wind velocity. Because of the relatively smooth water surface, wind speeds do not decrease as much close to the sea as they do on land. Over a city or rough terrain, the wind gradient effect could cause a reduction of 40% to 50% of the geostrophic wind speed aloft; while over open water or ice, the reduction may be only 20% to 30%.

For engineering purposes, the wind gradient is modeled as a simple shear exhibiting a vertical velocity profile varying according to a power law with a constant exponential coefficient based on surface type. The height above ground where surface friction has a negligible effect on wind speed is called the &quot;gradient height&quot; and the wind speed above this height is assumed to be a constant called the &quot;gradient wind speed&quot;. For example, typical values for the predicted gradient height are 457 m for large cities, 366 m for suburbs, 274 m for open terrain, and 213 m for open sea.

Although the power law exponent approximation is convenient, it has no theoretical basis. When the temperature profile is adiabatic, the wind speed should vary logarithmically with height, Measurements over open terrain in 1961 showed good agreement with the logarithmic fit up to 100 m or so, with near constant average wind speed up through 1000 m.

The shearing of the wind is usually three-dimensional, that is, there is also a change in direction between the &#x27;free&#x27; pressure-driven geostrophic wind and the wind close to the ground. This is related to the Ekman spiral effect. 
The cross-isobar angle of the diverted ageostrophic flow near the surface ranges from 10¬∞ over open water, to 30¬∞ over rough hilly terrain, and can increase to 40¬∞-50¬∞ over land at night when the wind speed is very low.

After sundown the wind gradient near the surface increases, with the increasing stability.
Atmospheric stability occurring at night with radiative cooling tends to contain turbulent eddies vertically, increasing the wind gradient. The magnitude of the wind gradient is largely influenced by the height of the convective boundary layer and this effect is even larger over the sea, where there is no diurnal variation of the height of the boundary layer as there is over land.
In the convective boundary layer, strong mixing diminishes vertical wind gradient.

==Implications==

===Engineering===

The design of buildings must account for wind loads, and these are affected by wind gradient. The respective gradient levels, usually assumed in the Building Codes, are 500 meters for cities, 400 meters for suburbs, and 300 m for flat open terrain. For engineering purposes, a power law wind speed profile may be defined as follows:
formula_1
where:
*formula_2 = wind speed at height formula_3
*formula_4 = wind speed at gradient height formula_5
*formula_6 = exponential coefficient

====Wind turbines====

Wind turbine operation is affected by wind gradient. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel, which results in asymmetric load. The wind gradient can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two-bladed turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind gradient over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in windparks which are placed in (shallow) seas. It would be preferable for wind turbines to be tested in a wind tunnel simulating the wind gradient that they will eventually see, but this is rarely done.

For wind turbine engineering, a polynomial variation in wind speed with height can be defined relative to wind measured at a reference height of 10 meters as:
formula_7
where:
*formula_8 = velocity of the wind [m/s], at height formula_9
*formula_10 = velocity of the wind [m/s], at height formula_11 = 10 meters
*formula_12 = Hellmann exponent

The Hellmann exponent depends upon the coastal location and the shape of the terrain on the ground, and the stability of the air. Examples of values of the Hellmann exponent are given in the table below:

===Gliding===
In gliding, wind gradient affects the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider.
Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden,
or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding
the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the
gradient.

When landing, wind gradient is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.

Wind gradient is also a hazard for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the aileron control authority, causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.

===Sailing===
In sailing, wind gradient affects sailboats by presenting a different wind speed to the sail at different heights along the mast. The direction also varies with height, but sailors refer to this as &quot;wind shear.&quot;

The mast head instruments indication of apparent wind speed and direction is different from what the sailor sees and feels near the surface. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist in the design of the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height. The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for wind gradient, for example using a boom vang.

According to one source, the wind gradient is not significant for sailboats when the wind is over 6 knots (because a wind speed of 10 knots at the surface corresponds to 15 knots at 300 meters, so the change in speed is negligible over the height of a sailboat&#x27;s mast). According to the same source, the wind increases steadily with height up to about 10 meters in 5 knot winds but less if there is less wind. That source states that in winds with average speeds of six knots or more, the change of speed with height is confined almost entirely to the one or two meters closest to the surface. This is consistent with another source, which shows that the change in wind speed is very small for heights over 2 meters and with a statement by the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology according to which differences can be as little as 5% in unstable air.

In kitesurfing, the wind gradient is even more important, because the power kite is flown on 20-30m lines, and the kitesurfer can use the kite to jump off the water, bringing the kite to even greater heights above the sea surface.

===Sound propagation===

Wind gradient can have a pronounced effect upon sound propagation in the lower atmosphere. This effect is important in understanding sound propagation from distant sources, such as foghorns, thunder, sonic booms, gunshots or other phenomena like mistpouffers. It is also important in studying noise pollution, for example from roadway noise and aircraft noise, and must be considered in the design of noise barriers.
When wind speed increases with altitude, wind blowing towards the listener from the source will refract sound waves downwards, resulting in increased noise levels downwind of the barrier. These effects were first quantified in the field of highway engineering to address variations of noise barrier efficacy in the 1960s.

When the sun warms the Earth&#x27;s surface, there is a negative temperature gradient in atmosphere. The speed of sound decreases with decreasing temperature, so this also creates a negative sound speed gradient. The sound wave front travels faster near the ground, so the sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. The radius of curvature of the sound path is inversely proportional to the velocity gradient.

A wind speed gradient of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature lapse rate of 7.5¬†¬∞C/km. Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs because there is a wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.

There will usually be both a wind gradient and a temperature gradient. In that case, the effects of both might add together or subtract depending on the situation and the location of the observer.
The wind gradient and the temperature gradient can also have complex interactions. For example, a foghorn can be audible at a place near the source, and a distant place, but not in a sound shadow between them.
In the case of transverse sound propagation, wind gradients do not sensibly modify sound propagation relative to the windless condition; the gradient effect appears to be important only in upwind and downwind configurations.

For sound propagation, the exponential variation of wind speed with height can be defined as follows:
formula_13
formula_14
where:
*formula_15 = speed of the wind at height formula_9, and formula_17 is a constant
*formula_18 = exponential coefficient based on ground surface roughness, typically between 0.08 and 0.52
*formula_19 = expected wind gradient at height formula_20

In the 1862 American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.

Scientists have understood the effect of wind gradient upon refraction of sound since the mid-1900s; however, with the advent of the U.S. Noise Control Act, this refractive phenomenon was widely used beginning in the early 1970s, chiefly in the consideration of noise propagation from highways and resultant design of transportation facilities.

===Wind gradient soaring===

Wind gradient soaring, also called dynamic soaring, is a technique used by soaring birds including albatrosses. If the wind gradient is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy.

<text>Rocciamelone (, or &quot;Roche Melon&quot;) is a 3,538¬†m high mountain in Piedmont, Italy, near the border between Italy and France.

== Geography ==

Rocciamelone is located between Val di Susa and Maurienne, 50¬†km west of Turin.

Its summit is the tripoint where the comunes of Usseglio, Novalesa and Mompantero meet. The international border crosses the &quot;Glacier de Rochemelon&quot; 1 kilometer north of the summit, making it appear that the border is not following the watershed precisely in this sector. However, the glacier is draped over a ridge that is the true watershed and is precisely followed by the borderline.

=== SOIUSA classification ===

According to the SOIUSA (&quot;International Standardized Mountain Subdivision of the Alps&quot;) the mountain can be classified in the following way:
* main part = Western Alps
* major sector = North Western Alps
* section = Graian Alps
* subsection = Southern Graian Alps
* supergroup = catena Rocciamelone-Charbonnel
* group = gruppo del Rocciamelone
* subgroup = nodo del Rocciamelone
* code = I/B-7.I-A.2.a

== History ==
The teutonic knight Bonifacius Rotarius (of Asti) made the first ascent of Rocciamelone on 1 September 1358, to bring a small metal image of the Holy Virgin as a gesture of gratitude for having survived captivity in the Holy Land during a war against the Muslims.
The summit of Rocciamelone is the destination of a traditional pilgrimage, every year, on August 5. A statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary was erected there in 1899.

== Access to the summit ==
Because of its easy access (the start of the summit trail can be reached in a 90-minute drive from Turin), its considerable height and the panorama, this mountain is one of the most frequented of the western part of the Alps.

== Mountain huts ==
* Rifugio C√† d&#x27;Asti (2,854 m - Mompantero)
* Rifugio Ernesto Tazzetti (2,642 - Usseglio)
* Rifugio Santa Maria (close to the summit)

<doc id="454223" wikidata="Q777564" url="?curid=454223" title="Pretty in Pink">
<text>Pretty in Pink is a 1986 American teen romantic comedy-drama film about love and social cliques in American high schools in the 1980s. The film stars Molly Ringwald and Harry Dean Stanton alongside Jon Cryer, Annie Potts, James Spader, and Andrew McCarthy. A cult classic, it is commonly identified as a &quot;Brat Pack&quot; film. The film follows high school senior Andie Walsh (Ringwald), and her relationships with her love interest Blane McDonnagh (McCarthy), her best friend Philip F. &quot;Duckie&quot; Dale (Cryer), and her father (Dean Stanton).

It was directed by Howard Deutch, produced by Lauren Shuler Donner, and written by John Hughes, who also served as co-executive producer. The film was named after a song by the Psychedelic Furs, and the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which has been acclaimed as &quot;among the most brilliant in modern cinema&quot;, features a re-recorded version of the song. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;If You Leave&quot; became an international hit and charted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in May 1986.

&quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; premiered at Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre on January 29, 1986, and was released theatrically in the United States on February 28. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised Ringwald&#x27;s performance, and grossed $40.5 million against a $9 million budget.

==Plot==

High school senior Andie Walsh lives with her underemployed working-class father, Jack, in a Chicago suburb. Andie&#x27;s best friend, an outsider named Philip &quot;Duckie&quot; Dale, is in love with her, but is afraid to tell her how he truly feels. In school, Duckie and Andie, along with their friends, are harassed and bullied by the arrogant &quot;richie&quot; and popular kids, specifically Benny Hanson and her boyfriend, Steff McKee, who finds Andie attractive and secretly resents having been rejected by her.

Andie works after school at Trax, a hip record store managed by the quirky thirty-something Iona. Andie starts talking about her school&#x27;s senior prom to Iona, who advises her to go, despite not having a date. Blane McDonnagh, one of the preppy boys and Steff&#x27;s best friend, falls for Andie and eventually asks her out.

On the night of the date, Andie waits for Blane at Trax, but he is late. Duckie enters and asks her to go out with him, but she ignores him. When Blane arrives, Duckie becomes upset and argues with Andie before storming off. Blane brings Andie to Steff&#x27;s house party, where Andie is mistreated by the rich partygoers. Andie then brings Blane to a local nightclub, where Iona is sitting with Duckie, who is hostile and jealous toward Blane.

After another argument with Duckie, Andie and Blane walk out of the club. She tells him she wants to go home, but refuses to let him bring her there, confessing she doesn&#x27;t want him to see where she lives. Andie eventually allows Blane to drop her off, he asks her to the prom and they share their first kiss. Andie visits Iona the next day to talk about the date. Meanwhile, Blane, pressured by Steff, Benny, and rich friends, begins distancing himself from Andie.

Jack presents Andie with a pink dress that he has bought for her. However, they begin to argue because he has been lying about going to a full-time job. Jack breaks down, revealing that he is still bitter and depressed about his wife having left them.

At school, Andie confronts Blane for avoiding her and not returning her calls. When asked about the prom, he claims that he had already asked somebody else but had forgotten. Andie calls Blane a liar, saying he is ashamed of being seen with her as his rich friends will not approve. Andie runs away as a teary-eyed Blane leaves, with Steff trashing Andie as he passes. Duckie overhears Steff and attacks him in the hallway. The two fight before teachers intervene. Andie goes to Iona, upset about what happened, and asks for her old prom dress.

Using the fabric from Iona&#x27;s dress and the dress that her father had bought, Andie creates a pink prom dress. When she arrives at the prom, Andie has second thoughts about braving the crowd on her own until she sees Duckie. They reconcile and walk into the ballroom hand in hand.

As a drunk Steff begins mocking the couple, Blane confronts him and finally realizes that Steff resents Andie because she had turned down his advances. He calls him out on his spoiled and entitled attitude, saying that he no longer wishes to associate with him. Blane shakes Duckie&#x27;s hand and apologizes to Andie, telling her that he always believed in her and that he will always love her, kissing her cheek before walking out.

Duckie concedes that Blane is not like the other rich kids at school and advises Andie to go after him, joking that he will never take her to another prom if she does not. He then sees a girl smiling at him, signaling him to come over and dance. Andie catches up with Blane in the parking lot and they kiss.

Charlie Sheen was considered for the role of Blane but Ringwald convinced the film makers to cast McCarthy instead. Anthony Michael Hall turned down the role of Duckie because he didn&#x27;t want to be typecast. Ringwald lobbied for Robert Downey Jr. to be cast as Duckie but agreed that Cryer made sense in light of the film&#x27;s revised ending. Jennifer Beals turned down the role of Andie Walsh. Jodie Foster, Sarah Jessica Parker, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, and Lori Loughlin were also considered.

==Production==
===Origin===
Ringwald said that she introduced Hughes to The Psychedelic Furs song of the same name, which inspired Hughes to write the screenplay.

===Production===
Deutch felt there was something missing in the opening scene. Hughes later wrote the scene where Jack tells Andie maybe she could add some ruffles underneath his T-shirt.

===Changed ending===
Originally, the film portrayed Andie and Duckie ending up together. However, test audiences booed this ending. John Hughes wrote a new five-page ending where Andie and Blane get together instead. This was shot several months after the film wrapped production, and was filmed in one day on a soundstage designed to look like the Los Angeles hotel ballroom where the first ending had been filmed. When called back to film the new scene, Andrew McCarthy was in pre-production for a stage play, and had lost weight and cut his hair for the stage role, so he was fitted with a wig for the re-shoot. Molly Ringwald had anticipated that audiences would be dissatisfied with the original ending, saying: &quot;It didn&#x27;t make sense to have the entire movie be this Cinderella story [yet] she doesn&#x27;t get to end up with the guy she wants.&quot; Ringwald has said Duckie was based on her best friend, who was gay and with whom she &quot;had an extremely nonromantic relationship&quot;.

Jon Cryer has stated that he was shocked that the test audience was unhappy about the pairing, and felt that the whole film was built around Andie and Duckie ending up together. Hughes aimed &quot;to protect Duckie&#x27;s character&quot; in the new ending by having another girl at the prom show interest in him, played by Kristy Swanson in her first theatrical film role and credited as &quot;Duckette&quot;. Paramount executives were also apprehensive about the original ending, worried that the film might be perceived as classist and as suggesting that wealthy people and poor people should not interact. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark had written the song &quot;Goddess of Love&quot; for the original ending (which they later rewrote and released on the album &quot;The Pacific Age&quot;). Hughes didn&#x27;t consider the song a good fit for the newly re-shot Andie/Blane ending and asked the band to write something else. With only two days before going on tour, OMD wrote &quot;If You Leave&quot; in less than 24 hours. Paramount has said that they have been unable to locate the footage of the original ending.

===Dedication===
In the closing credits, the film is dedicated to actress Alexa Kenin and set designer Bruce Weintraub, both of whom died shortly after production had finished.

===Novel===
The film was adapted into a novel written by H. B. Gilmour and Randi Reisfield, released in 1986. It was published by Bantam Books (. ). The book was written before the last scene was changed, so it has the original ending in which Andie ends up with Duckie instead of Blane.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; was the top-grossing film for the week of March 12, 1986. The film earned US$6.1 million during its opening weekend and $40.5 million during its theatrical run. It was the 22nd-highest-grossing film of 1986.

===Reception===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 56 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Molly Ringwald gives an outstanding performance in this sweet, intelligent teen comedy that takes an ancient premise and injects it with insight and wit.&quot;

 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, criticizing the &quot;old, old, old&quot; plot but praising the performances of Molly Ringwald and Annie Potts, and calling it &quot;a heartwarming and mostly truthful movie, with some nice touches of humor.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Fortunately, the actors are mostly likable, and the story is told gently enough to downplay both its trendiness and its conventionality.&quot;

James Harwood of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;In his mid-30s, John Hughes&#x27; much-vaunted teen thinking now seems to be maturing a bit in &quot;Pretty in Pink,&quot; a rather intelligent (if not terribly original) look at adolescent insecurities ... Teamed with Hughes for the third time, Molly Ringwald is herself growing as an actress, lending &quot;Pink&quot; a solid emotional center that largely boils down to making the audience care about her.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Ringwald &quot;carries the movie, though she has nothing particularly interesting to do or say,&quot; and called the film &quot;slight and vapid, with the consistency of watery Jello.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four, faulting a &quot;tired script&quot; and Cryer&#x27;s &quot;one-note performance,&quot; though he found Ringwald &quot;absolutely beguiling.&quot;

Patrick Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;delightful,&quot; adding that &quot;what makes &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; such a satisfying, big-hearted film isn&#x27;t its creaky story line or its somewhat unconvincing conclusion, but the way it lets us watch kids through their own eyes, exploring feelings instead of making caricatures of them. Written by Hughes and directed by newcomer Howard Deutch, the movie neatly captures the nuances of youth, reminding us how the most casual remark can unleash a flood of insecurities.&quot;

Paul Attanasio of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;for the most part, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; works from a standard formula‚Äîrich boy, poor girl‚Äîand does little to tweak or reinvent it.&quot;

===Legacy===
The main cast of &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; was featured in an October 15, 2010 issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that featured reunions with the casts of landmark films and television shows.

==Soundtrack==

As with previous films by John Hughes, &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; featured a soundtrack composed mostly of new wave music. While director Howard Deutch originally intended the film to primarily contain theme music, Hughes influenced Deutch&#x27;s decision to use post-punk music throughout the film. The title song by the Psychedelic Furs acted as a bit of inspiration for the film and was re-recorded specifically for the film&#x27;s opening sequence in a version that was less raw than the original version that appeared on the 1981 album &quot;Talk Talk Talk&quot;. &quot;Left of Center&quot; was remixed by Arthur Baker. The first track, &quot;If You Leave&quot;, by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, was written in 1985 specifically for the film. In addition to their soundtrack song &quot;Shellshock&quot;, New Order also contributed an instrumental version of &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Elegia&quot;, both of which appear in the film but not on the soundtrack.

The Rave-Ups, who appear in the film performing &quot;Positively Lost Me&quot; and &quot;Shut-Up&quot; from their &quot;Town and Country&quot; album, do not have any songs on the soundtrack album. Nik Kershaw&#x27;s &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Good&quot; appears on the soundtrack in a version by former Three Dog Night vocalist Danny Hutton&#x27;s band, Danny Hutton Hitters. The Smiths&#x27; &quot;Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want&quot; appears on the soundtrack and was later covered by the Autumns for the 2000 &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Still... The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Revisited&quot; album. Also noteworthy is the inclusion of Echo &amp; the Bunnymen&#x27;s &quot;Bring On the Dancing Horses&quot;, which, according to the liner notes of the CD release of the band&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Songs to Learn &amp; Sing&quot;, was recorded specifically for the film.

The film also includes Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot;, to which Duckie lip-synchs in the film, the Association&#x27;s &quot;Cherish&quot; and Talk Back&#x27;s &quot;Rudy&quot;. These three tracks do not appear on the official soundtrack album.

The soundtrack was released on vinyl by A&amp;M Records in 1986. It was re-released in 2013 as a limited edition on pink-colored vinyl.

The album was listed on the &quot;Best Movie Soundtracks: The 15 Film Music Compilations That&#x27;ll Change Your Life&quot; list in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; and &quot;The 25 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time&quot; list in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. AllMusic rated it four stars out of five.

<text>James Mason Crafts (March 8, 1839 ‚Äì June 20, 1917) was an American chemist, mostly known for developing the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation and acylation reactions with Charles Friedel in 1876.

==Biography==
James Crafts, the son of Royal Altamont Crafts and Marianne Mason (daughter of Senator Jeremiah Mason), was born in Boston, Massachusetts and graduated from Harvard University in 1858. Although he never received his Ph.D., he studied chemistry in Germany at the Academy of Mines (1859) of Freiberg, and served as an assistant to Robert Bunsen at Heidelberg, and then with Wurtz in Paris (1861).

It was in Paris that Crafts first met Charles Friedel, with whom he later carried out some of his most successful research. Crafts returned to the United States in 1865. In 1868, he was appointed as the first professor of chemistry at the newly founded Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he remained until 1870.

During the following four years Crafts served as professor of chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but in 1874 took a leave of absence, joined Friedel in Paris, and devoted himself exclusively to scientific research. Upon his second return to the United States, in 1891, Crafts became professor of organic chemistry at MIT (1892‚Äì97), where he also served as president from 1898 to 1900. In 1900, Crafts resigned the presidency, and again turned to the investigation of problems in organic and physical chemistry.

==Scientific work==

Craft&#x27;s investigations were largely in the field of organic chemistry, but his name is connected also with many interesting achievements in physics and in physical chemistry. He invented a new hydrogen thermometer; measured the densities of iodine at very high temperatures; demonstrated an interesting regularity in the variation of the boiling points of chemically allied substances with the external pressure; prepared a number of new compounds of the element silicon, which are interesting because of their chemical resemblance to the corresponding compounds of carbon; and also prepared new compounds of arsenic. But his most important achievement was the discovery, jointly with Friedel, of one of the most fruitful synthetic methods in organic chemistry, the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction.

Hundreds of new carbon compounds have been brought into existence by this method (New International Encyclopedia), which is based on the catalytic action of the chloride of aluminium.

== Recognition ==

In recognition of Crafts&#x27;s services to science, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1867 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1872. The French government made him a chevalier of the Legion of Honor (1885), and the British Association for the Advancement of Science made him one of its corresponding members. Harvard University conferred on him the honorary degree of LL.D. in 1898. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1916.

The Crafts entry at MIT&#x27;s Senior House dormitory is named in his honor.

<doc id="454231" wikidata="Q1088156" url="?curid=454231" title="Chronic lymphocytic leukemia">
<text>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. In patients with CLL, B cell lymphocytes can begin to collect in their blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:
# Slow-growing CLL (indolent CLL) 
# Fast-growing CLL
Many people do not have any symptoms when they are first diagnosed. Those with symptoms (about 5-10% of patients with CLL) may experience the following:

* Fevers
* Fatigue
* Night sweats
* Unexplained weight loss
* Loss of appetite
* Painless lymph node swelling
* Enlargement of the spleen, and/or
* A low red blood cell count (anemia).

These symptoms may worsen over time.
While the exact cause of CLL is unknown, having a family member with CLL increases one&#x27;s risk of developing the disease. Environmental risk factors include exposure to Agent Orange, ionizing radiation, and certain insecticides. The use of tobacco is also associated with an increased risk of having CLL.

Diagnosis is typically based on blood tests that find high numbers of mature lymphocytes and smudge cells.


When patients with CLL are not experiencing symptoms (i.e. are asymptomatic), they only need careful observation. This is because there is currently no evidence that early intervention can alter the course of the disease.

Patients with CLL have an increased risk of developing serious infections. Thus, they should be routinely monitored and promptly treated with antibiotics if an infection is present.

In patients with significant signs or symptoms, treat can involve chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. The most appropriate treatment is based on the individual&#x27;s age, physical condition, and whether they have the del(17p) or TP53 mutation.

As of 2024, the recommended first-line treatments include:

# Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi), such as such as ibrutinib, zanubrutinib, and acalabrutinib 
# B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, venetoclax, plus a CD20 antibody obinutuzumab, OR
# BTKi (i.e. ibrutinib) plus BCL-2 inhibitor (i.e. venetoclax)

CLL is the most common type of leukemia in the Western world. It most commonly affects individuals over the age of 65, due to the accumulation of genetic mutations that occur over time. CLL is rarely seen in individuals less than 40 years old. Men are more commonly affected than women, although the average lifetime risk for both genders are similar (around 0.5-1%) . It represents less than 1% of deaths from cancer.
==Signs and symptoms==
Most people are diagnosed as having CLL based on the result of a routine blood test that shows a high white blood cell count, specifically a large increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes. Most commonly, patients have no symptoms at first. In a small number of cases, patients with CLL may present with enlarged lymph nodes, partially in areas around the neck, armpit, or groin. In rare circumstances, the disease is recognized only after the cancerous cells overwhelm the bone marrow, resulting in low red blood cells, neutrophils, or platelets. This can then result in symptoms such as fever, easy bleeding/bruising, night sweats, weight loss, and increased tiredness. In some instances, the cancerous cells can accumulate in the spleen and result in splenomegaly.

===Complications===
About 25% of patients with CLL have very low levels of antibodies in their bloodstream (hypogammaglobulinemia) at diagnosis, with several more patients developing this throughout the course of their disease. This decrease in antibodies increases the patient&#x27;s risk of recurrent infections and other autoimmune complications, such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurs in about 5-10% of CLL patients, which is when one&#x27;s own immune system attacks its own red blood cells.

A more serious complication called Richter&#x27;s transformation (RT) occurs in 2-10% of patients with CLL. This is a process in which the original CLL cells convert to a far more aggressive disease that has the biology and histopathology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma or less commonly Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. These patients typically present with a sudden clinical deterioration that can be characterized by unexplained fevers or weight loss, asymmetric and rapid growth of lymph nodes, and/or a significant drop in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets. Treatment for RT typically consists of various chemotherapy/chemo-immunotherapy protocols.

CLL has also been reported to convert into other more aggressive diseases such as lymphoblastic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, high grade T cell lymphomas, acute myeloid leukemia, lung cancer, brain cancer, melanoma of the eye or skin, salivary gland tumors, and Kaposi&#x27;s sarcomas. While some of these conversions have been termed RTs, the World Health Organization and most reviews have defined RT as a conversion of CLL/SLL into a disease with DLBCL or HL histopathology.

Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement can also rarely occur with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Some of the reported manifestations include intussusception, small intestinal bacterial contamination, colitis, and bleeding. Usually, GI complications with CLL occur after Richter transformation. Two cases to date have been reported of GI involvement in chronic lymphocytic leukemia without Richter&#x27;s transformation.

==Causes==
The exact cause of CLL is unknown. However, family history has been strongly correlated with the development of disease. Environmental factors may also play a role in the development of CLL. For instance, exposure to Agent Orange increases the risk of CLL, and exposure to hepatitis C virus may increase the risk. There is no clear association between ionizing radiation exposure and the risk of developing CLL. Blood transfusions have been ruled out as a risk factor.

== Mechanism ==
CLL results from an unusual growth and expansion of white blood cells. This manifestation typically begins with a single hematopoietic stem cell that acquires certain mutations over time that allows it to continue to expand and grow at a faster rate than other cells. Each patient with CLL may be affected by a different set of mutations, making these cells sometimes difficult to target and treat. Some of the most common mutations that have been found in CLL-affected cells include the following: &quot;NOTCH1&quot;, &quot;TP53&quot;, &quot;ATM&quot;, and &quot;SF3B1&quot;.

CLL can also be caused by a number of epigenetic changes, which are adaptations that add a tag to specific DNA sequences, rather than altering the sequence itself. In CLL, these changes can be classified into the addition of three different methyl subgroups (na√Øve B-cell-like, memory B-cell-like, and intermediate), which impact how much that DNA sequence is transcribed. Some relevant genetic mutations may be inherited. Since there is no one single mutation that is associated with CLL in all cases, an individual&#x27;s susceptibility may be impacted when multiple mutations that are associated with an increase in the risk of CLL are co-inherited. Up until 2020, 45 susceptibility loci have been identified. Of these loci, 93% are linked to the alteration of 30 gene expressions involved in immune response, cell survival, or Wnt signaling.

As CLL cells accumulate, they begin to promote inflammation and an immunosuppressive environment through the release of different chemical signals.

CLL is commonly preceded by a pre-cancerous state known as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL). This occurs when there is in an increase in a specific type of white blood cells but the number remains less than 5 billion cells per liter (L) (5x109/L) of blood. This subtype, termed chronic lymphocytic leukemia-type MBL (CLL-type MBL) is an asymptomatic, indolent, and chronic disorder in which people exhibit a mild increase in the number of circulating B-cell lymphocytes. These B-cells are monoclonal, which means they are produced by a single ancestral B-cell. They share some of the same cell marker proteins, chromosome abnormalities, and gene mutations that are found in CLL.

CLL-type MBL can be separated into two groups:

# Low-count MBL has monoclonal B-cell blood counts of &lt;0.5x109 cells/liter (i.e. 0.5x109/L) 
# High-count MBL has blood monoclonal B-cell counts ‚â•0.5x109/L but &lt;5x109/L.

Low-count MBL rarely if ever progresses to CLL, while high-count CLL/SLL MBL does so at a rate of around 1% per year. Thus, CLL may present in individuals with a long history of having high-count MBL. There is no established treatment for these individuals except monitoring for development of the disorder&#x27;s various complications (see treatment of MBL complications) and for their progression to CLL.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of CLL is based on the demonstration of an abnormal population of B lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, or tissues that display an unusual but characteristic pattern of molecules on the cell surface. CLL is usually first suspected by a diagnosis of lymphocytosis, an increase in a type of white blood cell, on a complete blood count test. This frequently is an incidental finding on a routine physician visit. Most often the lymphocyte count is greater than 5000 cells per microliter (ŒºL) of blood but can be much higher. The presence of lymphocytosis in a person who is elderly should raise strong suspicion for CLL, and a confirmatory diagnostic test, in particular flow cytometry should be performed unless clinically unnecessary.

=== Classification ===
In order to be diagnosed with CLL, the patient must have a white blood cell count greater than 5 billion cells per liter (L) (5x109/L) of blood. If CLL-type cells are mainly found in the lymph nodes or lymphoid tissue (such as the spleen), a diagnosis of small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is made. However, when these cancerous cells appear mostly in the blood, the disease is classified as CLL.

===Clinical staging===

Staging, which helps determine the extent of the disease, is done using one of two systems: the Rai staging system or the Binet classification. These systems are simple, requiring the use of only physical examination and blood test results.

Rai staging system (most commonly used in the United States) 
* Low-risk disease &quot;(formerly Stage 0)&quot;: characterized by lymphocytosis with cancer cells in the blood and/or bone marrow without lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia
* Intermediate-risk disease &quot;(formerly Stage I/II)&quot;: characterized by lymphocytosis, swollen lymph nodes (may be palpable or not), spleen enlargement, and/or liver enlargement 
* High-risk disease &quot;(formerly Stage III/IV)&quot;: characterized by lymphocytosis with associated anemia (hemoglobin &lt;11 g/dL) OR thrombocytopenia (&lt;100,000/mm3) with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or anemia

Binet classification (most commonly used in Europe): This classification system is based on the number of areas within the body that have been affected and the presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia. Areas of involvement include the (1) head and neck (considered one), (2) one or both of the armpits, (3) the groin, (4) the spleen, and (5) the liver. They are considered affected if a lymph node greater than 1¬†cm in diameter is present and/or the spleen or liver are palpable.
* &quot;Clinical stage A&quot;: characterized by no anemia (Hb &gt; 10 g/dL) or thrombocytopenia (platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L) and no greater than two areas of lymphoid involvement (described above) 
* &quot;Clinical stage B&quot;: characterized by no anemia (Hb &gt; 10 g/dL) or thrombocytopenia (platelets &gt; 100 x 109/L) with three or more areas of lymphoid involvement 
* &quot;Clinical stage C&quot;: characterized by anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL) and/or thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 100 x 109/L) regardless of the number of areas of lymph node or organ enlargement

====Array-based karyotyping====
Array-based karyotyping is a cost-effective alternative to FISH for detecting chromosomal abnormalities in CLL. Several clinical validation studies have shown &gt;95% concordance with the standard CLL FISH panel.

=== Molecular examination of peripheral blood and flow cytometry ===
The combination of the microscopic examination of the peripheral blood and analysis of the lymphocytes by flow cytometry to confirm clonality and molecular expression is needed to establish the diagnosis of CLL. Both are easily accomplished with a small sample of blood.

A flow cytometer instrument can examine the expression of molecules on individual cells. This requires the use of specific antibodies to cell-surface molecules that have fluorescent tags that are recognized by the instrument. In CLL, the lymphocytes are all genetically identical since they are derived from the same B cell lineage. CLL cells can express the typical B-cell markers such as CD19 and CD20, as well as abnormal surface markers such as CD5 and CD23.

On a peripheral blood smear, CLL cells resemble normal lymphocytes, although slightly smaller. They are also very fragile and susceptible to breaking when smeared onto a glass slide, giving rise to &quot;smudge&quot; or &quot;smear&quot; cells, which are a hallmark of the disease. Smudge cells are a result of CLL cells lacking vimentin, a type of cytoskeleton proteins which is a structural component in a cell which maintains the cell&#x27;s internal shape and mechanical resilience).

=== Surface markers ===
The atypical molecular pattern on the surface of the cell includes the co-expression of cell surface markers clusters of differentiation 5 (CD5) and 23. In addition, all the CLL cells within one individual are clonal, that is, genetically identical. In practice, this is inferred by the detection of only one of the mutually exclusive antibody light chains, kappa or lambda, on the entire population of the abnormal B cells. Normal B lymphocytes consist of a stew of different antibody-producing cells, resulting in a mixture of both kappa- and lambda-expressing cells. The lack of the normal distribution of these B cells is one basis for demonstrating clonality, the key element for establishing a diagnosis of any B cell malignancy (B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The Matutes&#x27;s CLL score allows the identification of a homogeneous subgroup of classical CLL, that differs from atypical/mixed CLL for the five markers&#x27; expression (CD5, CD23, FMC7, CD22, and immunoglobulin light chain)
Matutes&#x27;s CLL scoring system is very helpful for the differential diagnosis between classical CLL and the other B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, but not for the immunological distinction between mixed/atypical CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL malignant B cells). Discrimination between CLL and MCL can be improved by adding non-routine markers such as CD54 and CD200. Among routine markers, the most discriminating feature is the CD20/CD23 mean fluorescence intensity ratio. In contrast, FMC7 expression can surprisingly be misleading for borderline cases.

===Related diseases===

In the past, cases with similar microscopic appearance in the blood but with a T cell phenotype were referred to as T-cell CLL. However, these are now recognized as a separate disease group and are currently classified as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemias (T-PLL). An accurate diagnosis of T-PLL is important as it is a rare and aggressive disease.

CLL should not be confused with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a highly aggressive leukemia most commonly diagnosed in children, and highly treatable in the pediatric setting.

===Differential diagnosis===
Hematologic disorders that may resemble CLL in their clinical presentation, behavior, and microscopic appearance include mantle cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, B cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.
* B cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a related, but more aggressive disorder, has cells with similar phenotype, but are significantly larger than normal lymphocytes and have a prominent nucleolus. The distinction is important as the prognosis and therapy differ from CLL.
* Hairy cell leukemia is also a neoplasm of B lymphocytes, but the neoplastic cells have a distinct morphology under the microscope (hairy cell leukemia cells have delicate, hair-like projections on their surfaces) and unique marker molecule expression.

All the B cell malignancies of the blood and bone marrow can be differentiated from one another by the combination of cellular microscopic morphology, marker molecule expression, and specific tumor-associated gene defects. This is best accomplished by evaluation of the patient&#x27;s blood, bone marrow, and occasionally lymph node cells by a pathologist with specific training in blood disorders. A flow cytometer is necessary for cell marker analysis, and the detection of genetic problems in the cells may require visualizing the DNA changes with fluorescent probes by FISH.

== Prevention/Screening ==
Routine visits with your primary health care provider is recommended, so that they may regularly monitor your white blood cell count and watch out for the development of any signs or symptoms related to CLL.

==Treatment==
CLL treatment focuses on controlling and limiting the progress of the disease and its symptoms, as it currently remains incurable. In patients with little to no symptoms, watchful waiting with close observation is generally appropriate.

Treatment is recommended when patients become symptomatic or experience one of the following:

* Dangerous drops in their red blood cell or platelet count
* A doubling of their white blood cells in 6 months or less
* Significant splenomegaly 
* Severe swelling of the lymph nodes, and/or
* Richter transformation

As of 2024, first-line treatment for CLL involves the use of targeted biological therapy. Other treatment options include: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplantation, and supportive or palliative care.

Radiation therapy is usually only done in patients with SLL who have symptomatic localized disease, such as bulky lymph nodes. In special circumstances, patients can develop massive splenomegaly that may lead to the destruction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In these cases, the patient may be treated with steroids or IVIG; however, if the patient does not respond to these treatments, they may have to undergo a splenectomy, removal of the spleen.

CLL treatment regimens vary depending on the patient&#x27;s age, physical health, and progression of their disease. There are several agents that may be used for the treatment of CLL.

===Decision to treat===
While it is generally considered incurable, CLL progresses slowly in most cases. Many people with CLL lead normal and active lives for many years‚Äîin some cases for decades. Because of its slow onset, asymptomatic early-stage CLL (Rai 0, Binet A) is, in general, not treated since it is believed that early-stage CLL intervention does not improve survival time or quality of life. Instead, the condition is monitored over time to detect any change in the disease pattern.

There are two widely used staging systems in CLL to determine when and how to treat the patient: The Rai staging system, used in the United States, and the Binet system in Europe. Both these systems attempt to characterize the disease based on the bulk and marrow failure. A &quot;watchful waiting&quot; strategy is used for most patients with CLL. The International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) has issued guidelines with specific markers that should be met to initiate treatment, generally based on evidence for progressive symptomatic disease (summarized as &quot;active disease&quot;).

===Targeted biological therapy===

Targeted therapy attacks cancer cells at a specific target, with the aim of not harming normal cells. In patients will CLL, B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling appears to play a vital role in the growth and survival of CLL cells. BCR signaling is supported by a number of different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (such as BTK, PI3K, etc.), which can all be targeted in order to help interfere with the growth of these CLL cells. Another mechanism that CLL cells use to avoid destruction involves the use of proteins in the B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2) family. By blocking the function of those Bcl-2 proteins, targeted drugs can prevent further progression of CLL-related tumors.

Some of the most common biological drugs used to treat CLL include:

* Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (&quot;including ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib&quot;)
* BCL-2 inhibitors (&quot;including venetoclax&quot;), and
* Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (&quot;including idelalisib and duvelisib&quot;).

=== Monoclonal antibodies ===

==== Anti-CD20 antibodies ====
CD20 is a protein that is found on the surface of B-cells and thus serves as an important target in the treatment of many B-cell malignances, including CLL. Some CD20 antibodies that have been used for the treatment of CLL include:

* Rituximab
* Ofatumumab 
* Obinutuzumab

These agents are usually used in refractory/relapsed disease or in combination with other agents, like chlorambucil (CLB), fludarabine, or venetoclax.

==== Other monoclonal antibodies ====

* Alemtuzumab targets the CD52 receptor, which is usually found on the surface of many immune cells. This agent is also primarily used in refractory disease.

===Chemotherapy===
Monotherapy using alkylating agents (i.e. chlorambucil and bendamustine) served as a front-line therapy for CLL for many years. In fact, chlorambucil (CLB), was the &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment for CLL for several decades. However, researchers found that it was not very effective at helping patients achieve remission; thus, it may not be used as frequently in practice anymore.

Combination chemotherapy regimens can be effective in both newly diagnosed and relapsed CLL. Combinations of fludarabine with alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide) produce higher response rates and longer progression-free survival than single agents:
* FC (fludarabine with cyclophosphamide)
* FR (fludarabine with rituximab)
* FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab)

Although the purine analogue fludarabine was shown to give superior response rates to chlorambucil (CLB) as primary therapy, the early use of fludarabine has not been shown to improve overall survival, and some clinicians prefer to reserve fludarabine for relapsed disease.

Chemoimmunotherapy with FCR has shown to improve response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival in a large randomized trial in CLL patients selected for good physical fitness.

===Stem cell transplantation===
Autologous stem cell transplantation, using the recipient&#x27;s own cells, is not curative. Younger individuals, if at high risk for dying from CLL, may consider allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Myeloablative (bone marrow killing) forms of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, a high-risk treatment using blood cells from a healthy donor, may be curative, but treatment-related toxicity is significant. An intermediate level, called reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation, may be better tolerated by older or frail patients.

===Refractory CLL===
&quot;Refractory&quot; CLL is a disease that no longer responds favorably to treatment within six months following the last cancer therapy. In this case, more aggressive targeted therapies, such as BCR or BCL2 pathway inhibitors, have been associated with increased survival.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis can be affected by the type of genetic mutation that the person with CLL has. Some examples of genetic mutations and their prognoses are: mutations in the &quot;IGHV&quot; region are associated with a median overall survival (OS) of more than 20‚Äì25 years, while no mutations in this region is associated with a median OS of 8‚Äì10 years; deletion of chromosome 13q is associated with a median OS of 17 years; and trisomy of chromosome 12, as well as deletion of chromosome 11q, is associated with a median OS of 9‚Äì11 years. While prognosis is highly variable and dependent on various factors including these mutations, the average 5-year relative survival is 86.1%. Telomere length has been suggested to be a valuable prognostic indicator of survival. In addition, a person&#x27;s sex has been found to have an impact on CLL prognosis and treatment efficacy. More specifically, females have been found to survive longer (without disease progression) than males, when treated with certain medications.

As of 2022, the most commonly used prognostic score is the CLL International Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI). This system takes into account the following factors:

# &quot;TP53&quot; gene deletion and/or mutation
# Mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (&quot;IGHV&quot;) 
# Serum B2-microglobulin levels
# Clinical stage (see the Rai and Binet staging systems above)
# Age

==Epidemiology==
CLL is the most common type of leukemia in the Western world compared to non-Western regions such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa. It is observed globally that males are twice as likely than females to acquire CLL. CLL is primarily a disease of older adults, with 9 out of 10 cases occurring after the age of 50 years. The median age of diagnosis is 70 years. In young people, new cases of CLL are twice as likely to be diagnosed in men than in women. In older people, however, this difference becomes less pronounced: after the age of 80 years, new cases of CLL are diagnosed equally between men and women.

According to the American Cancer Society, they estimate that there will about 23,690 new cases of CLL with about 4,460 deaths from CLL in the United States throughout 2025. Five-year survival following diagnosis is approximately 83% in the United States. It represents less than 1% of deaths from cancer.

Because of the prolonged survival, which was typically about 10 years in past decades, but which can extend to a normal life expectancy, the prevalence (number of people living with the disease) is much higher than the incidence (new diagnoses). CLL is the most common type of leukemia in the UK, accounting for 38% of all leukemia cases. Approximately 3,200 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011.

In Western populations, subclinical &quot;disease&quot; can be identified in 3.5% of normal adults, and in up to 8% of individuals over the age of 70. That is, small clones of B cells with the characteristic CLL phenotype can be identified in many healthy elderly persons. The clinical significance of these cells is unknown.

In contrast, CLL is rare in Asian countries, such as Japan, China, and Korea, accounting for less than 10% of all leukemias in those regions. A low incidence is seen in Japanese immigrants to the US, and in African and Asian immigrants to Israel.

Of all cancers involving the same class of blood cell, 7% of cases are CLL/SLL.

People who live near areas with considerable industrial pollution have an elevated risk of developing leukemia, particularly CLL.

==Research directions==
In light of newer targeted therapies such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, the need for bone marrow transplants in patients with CLL has become rare. Bone marrow transplants are only recommended in specific cases when front-line therapies have either failed and/or the patient continues to relapse.
There have been major advances in the treatment of patients with CLL over the past 10 years or so. Although this disease remains incurable, therapies such as Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (&quot;including ibrutinib, acalabrutinib, and zanubrutinib&quot;), BCL-2 inhibitors (&quot;including venetoclax&quot;), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors (&quot;including idelalisib and duvelisib&quot;) allow patients with CLL to now live longer.

Despite the great success of these new targeted biological therapies so far, more research is needed in order to establish clearer guidelines on the optimal combination and sequence of these agents based on the patient&#x27;s specific clinical presentation. Furthermore, for patients who do not respond to these agents, treatment options are limited. Thus, further research should be focused on discovering therapies that target other important chemical pathways.

== Special Populations ==

===Pregnancy===
Leukemia is rarely associated with pregnancy, affecting only about one in 10,000 pregnant women. Treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemias can often be postponed until after the end of the pregnancy. If treatment is necessary, then giving chemotherapy during the second or third trimesters is less likely to result in pregnancy loss or birth defects than treatment during the first trimester.

<doc id="454234" wikidata="Q649999" url="?curid=454234" title="Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction">
<text>The Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reactions are a set of reactions developed by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1877 to attach substituents to an aromatic ring. Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reactions are of two main types: alkylation reactions and acylation reactions. Both proceed by electrophilic aromatic substitution. 


== Alkylation ==
===With alkenes===

In commercial applications, the alkylating agents are generally alkenes, some of the largest scale reactions practiced in industry. 
Such alkylations are of major industrial importance, e.g. for the production of ethylbenzene, the precursor to polystyrene, from benzene and ethylene and for the production of cumene from benzene and propene in cumene process:
:
Industrial production typically uses solid acids derived from a zeolite as the catalyst.

===With alkyl halides ===
Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation involves the alkylation of an aromatic ring. Traditionally, the alkylating agents are alkyl halides. Many alkylating agents can be used instead of alkyl halides. For example, enones and epoxides can be used in presence of protons. The reaction typically employs a strong Lewis acid, such as aluminium chloride as catalyst, to increase the electrophilicity of the alkylating agent.

This reaction suffers from the disadvantage that the product is more nucleophilic than the reactant because alkyl groups are activators for the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reaction. Consequently, overalkylation can occur. However, steric hindrance can be exploited to limit the number of successive alkylation cycles that occur, as in the &quot;t&quot;-butylation of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene that gives only the product of two alkylation cycles and with only one of three possible isomers of it:

Furthermore, the reaction is only useful for primary alkyl halides in an intramolecular sense when a 5- or 6-membered ring is formed. For the intermolecular case, the reaction is limited to tertiary alkylating agents, some secondary alkylating agents (ones for which carbocation rearrangement is degenerate), or alkylating agents that yield stabilized carbocations (e.g., benzylic or allylic ones). In the case of primary alkyl halides, the carbocation-like complex (R(+)---X---Al(-)Cl3) will undergo a carbocation rearrangement reaction to give almost exclusively the rearranged product derived from a secondary or tertiary carbocation.

Protonation of alkenes generates carbocations, the electrophiles. A laboratory-scale example by the synthesis of neophyl chloride from benzene and methallyl chloride using sulfuric acid catalyst.

==== Mechanism ====
The general mechanism for primary alkyl halides is shown in the figure below.
:For primary (and possibly secondary) alkyl halides, a carbocation-like complex with the Lewis acid, [R(+)---(X---MX&quot;n&quot;)(‚Äì)] is more likely to be involved, rather than a free carbocation.

===Friedel‚ÄìCrafts dealkylation===
Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylations can be reversible. Although this is usually undesirable it can be exploited; for instance by facilitating transalkylation reactions. 

It also allows alkyl chains to be added reversibly as protecting groups. This approach is used industrially in the synthesis of 4,4&#x27;-biphenol via the oxidative coupling and subsequent dealkylation of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol.

== Acylation ==
Friedel‚ÄìCrafts acylation involves the acylation of aromatic rings. Typical acylating agents are acyl chlorides. Acid anhydrides as well as carboxylic acids are also viable. A typical Lewis acid catalyst is aluminium trichloride. Because, however, the product ketone forms a rather stable complex with Lewis acids such as AlCl3, a stoichiometric amount or more of the &quot;catalyst&quot; must generally be employed, unlike the case of the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation, in which the catalyst is constantly regenerated. Reaction conditions are similar to the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation. This reaction has several advantages over the alkylation reaction. Due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group, the ketone product is always less reactive than the original molecule, so multiple acylations do not occur. Also, there are no carbocation rearrangements, as the acylium ion is stabilized by a resonance structure in which the positive charge is on the oxygen.

The viability of the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts acylation depends on the stability of the acyl chloride reagent. Formyl chloride, for example, is too unstable to be isolated. Thus, synthesis of benzaldehyde through the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts pathway requires that formyl chloride be synthesized &quot;in situ&quot;. This is accomplished by the Gattermann-Koch reaction, accomplished by treating benzene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen chloride under high pressure, catalyzed by a mixture of aluminium chloride and cuprous chloride. Simple ketones that could be obtained by Friedel‚ÄìCrafts acylation are produced by alternative methods, e.g., oxidation, in industry.

=== Reaction mechanism ===
The reaction proceeds through generation of an acylium center. The reaction is completed by deprotonation of the arenium ion by AlCl4‚àí, regenerating the AlCl3 catalyst. However, in contrast to the truly catalytic alkylation reaction, the formed ketone is a moderate Lewis base, which forms a complex with the strong Lewis acid aluminum trichloride. The formation of this complex is typically irreversible under reaction conditions. Thus, a stochiometric quantity of AlCl3 is needed. The complex is destroyed upon aqueous workup to give the desired ketone. For example, the classical synthesis of deoxybenzoin calls for 1.1 equivalents of AlCl3 with respect to the limiting reagent, phenylacetyl chloride. In certain cases, generally when the benzene ring is activated, Friedel‚ÄìCrafts acylation can also be carried out with &quot;catalytic&quot; amounts of a milder Lewis acid (e.g. Zn(II) salts) or a Br√∏nsted acid catalyst using the anhydride or even the carboxylic acid itself as the acylation agent.

If desired, the resulting ketone can be subsequently reduced to the corresponding alkane substituent by either Wolff‚ÄìKishner reduction or Clemmensen reduction. The net result is the same as the Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation except that rearrangement is not possible.

==Hydroxyalkylation==
Arenes react with certain aldehydes and ketones to form the hydroxyalkylated products, for example in the reaction of the mesityl derivative of glyoxal with benzene:

As usual, the aldehyde group is more reactive electrophile than the phenone.

==Scope and variations==

This reaction is related to several classic named reactions:
* The acylated reaction product can be converted into the alkylated product via a Clemmensen or a Wolff-Kishner reduction.
* The Gattermann‚ÄìKoch reaction can be used to synthesize benzaldehyde from benzene.
* The Gatterman reaction describes arene reactions with hydrocyanic acid.
* The Houben‚ÄìHoesch reaction describes arene reactions with nitriles.
* A reaction modification with an aromatic phenyl ester as a reactant is called the Fries rearrangement.
* In the Scholl reaction two arenes couple directly (sometimes called Friedel‚ÄìCrafts arylation).
* In the Blanc chloromethylation a chloromethyl group is added to an arene with formaldehyde, hydrochloric acid and zinc chloride.
* The Bogert‚ÄìCook synthesis (1933) involves the dehydration and isomerization of &quot;1-Œ≤-phenylethylcyclohexanol&quot; to the octahydro derivative of phenanthrene

* The Darzens‚ÄìNenitzescu synthesis of ketones (1910, 1936) involves the acylation of cyclohexene with acetyl chloride to methylcyclohexenylketone.
* In the related Nenitzescu reductive acylation (1936) a saturated hydrocarbon is added making it a reductive acylation to methylcyclohexylketone
* The Nencki reaction (1881) is the ring acetylation of phenols with acids in the presence of zinc chloride.
* In a green chemistry variation aluminium chloride is replaced by graphite in an alkylation of &quot;p&quot;-xylene with 2-bromobutane. This variation will not work with primary halides from which less carbocation involvement is inferred.

===Dyes===
Friedel‚ÄìCrafts reactions have been used in the synthesis of several triarylmethane and xanthene dyes. Examples are the synthesis of thymolphthalein (a pH indicator) from two equivalents of thymol and phthalic anhydride:

A reaction of phthalic anhydride with resorcinol in the presence of zinc chloride gives the fluorophore fluorescein. Replacing resorcinol by N,N-diethylaminophenol in this reaction gives rhodamine B:

===Haworth synthesis===
The Haworth synthesis is a classic method for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In this reaction, an arene is reacted with succinic anhydride, the subsequent product is then reduced in either a Clemmensen reduction or a Wolff-Kishner reduction. Lastly, a second Friedel-Crafts acylation takes place with addition of acid.
The product formed in this reaction is then analogously reduced, followed by a dehydrogenation reaction (with the reagent SeO2 for example) to extend the aromatic ring system.

===Friedel‚ÄìCrafts test for aromatic hydrocarbons===
Reaction of chloroform with aromatic compounds using an aluminium chloride catalyst gives triarylmethanes, which are often brightly colored, as is the case in triarylmethane dyes. This is a bench test for aromatic compounds.

<text>The band-rumped storm petrel, Madeiran storm petrel, or Harcourt&#x27;s storm petrel (Hydrobates castro) is of the storm petrel family Hydrobatidae.

==Description==

The band-rumped storm petrel is in length with a wingspan, and weighs . It is mainly brownish black with an extensive white rump. Similar to Leach&#x27;s storm petrel with the forked tail, long wings, but Leach&#x27;s has a more deeply forked tail, a differently shaped (V-shaped or triangular) white rump, and a &#x27;tern-like&#x27; flight, whereas the band-rumped storm-petrel has a more &#x27;shearwater-like&#x27; flight.

==Distribution==
The species breeds on islands in the warmer parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These include the Berlengas (a few tens of kilometres off mainland Portugal), the Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands and Saint Helena in the Atlantic, and in the Pacific off eastern Japan, on Kauai, Hawaii, and on the Gal√°pagos Islands. In 2016, the species was reported to have also started breeding on the Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Birds nest in colonies close to the sea in rock crevices and females lay a single white egg per breeding attempt. The band-rumped storm petrel spends the non-breeding period at sea. It is strictly nocturnal at its breeding sites to avoid predation by gulls and diurnal raptors such as peregrines, and will even avoid coming to land on clear moonlit nights. Like most petrels, its walking ability is limited to a short shuffle from/to the burrow.

===Feeding===
Individuals feed by picking up prey items (invertebrates, small vertebrates and sometimes carrion) from the water surface. A study aiming to determine the diving abilities of this species was actually conducted on the &#x27;warm season&#x27; population from the Azores, which was later recognized as a distinct species (see below).

==Taxonomy==
Recent discoveries of &#x27;cold season&#x27; and &#x27;warm season&#x27; populations, which use the same nest sites at different times of year, and also differ in terms of vocalisations and moulting period, may hint at the existence of two &#x27;cryptic species&#x27; within the currently understood limits of the species. After population genetics analyses of mtDNA, the warm season population in the Azores was recognized as a separate species, Monteiro&#x27;s storm petrel.

It was formerly defined in the genus &quot;Oceanodroma&quot; before that genus was synonymized with &quot;Hydrobates&quot;. It is monotypic, but the names &quot;cryptoleucura&quot; and &quot;bangsi&quot; (see above synonyms) were each formerly regarded as separate subspecies.

<doc id="454237" wikidata="Q1568835" url="?curid=454237" title="Masada (miniseries)">
<text>Masada is an American television miniseries that aired on ABC in April 1981. Advertised by the network as an &quot;ABC Novel for Television,&quot; the TV series&#x27; script is based on the 1971 novel &quot;The Antagonists&quot; by Ernest Gann, with a screenplay written by Joel Oliansky. It tells a fictionalized account of the historical siege of the Masada citadel in Israel by legions of the Roman Empire in AD 73. The siege ended when the Roman armies entered the fortress, only to discover the mass suicide by the Jewish defenders when defeat became imminent.

The miniseries starred: Peter O&#x27;Toole as Roman legion commander Lucius Flavius Silva, Peter Strauss as the Jewish commander Eleazar ben Ya&#x27;ir and Barbara Carrera as Silva&#x27;s Jewish mistress. It was O&#x27;Toole&#x27;s first appearance in an American miniseries.

&quot;Masada&quot; was one of several historical miniseries produced in the early 1980s, following the success of the miniseries &quot;Roots,&quot; that aired on the ABC Network in 1977, and &quot;Shogun&quot;, which aired on NBC in 1980.

==Plot==
===Part I===
In the year 70 AD, with the fall of Jerusalem and the destruction of the Second Temple, the Jewish rebellion against Roman occupation is declared over, but Eleazar ben Ya&#x27;ir and his family flee the city, vowing that the Judean War is not ended. Eleazar and his followers make their headquarters on top of the mountain fortress of Masada. From there they conduct raids on Roman occupied villages in the south of Judea. These guerrilla attacks threaten the credibility of the declared Roman victory. 

The commanding general of the 10th Legion, Cornelius Flavius Silva, arranges a meeting with Eleazar to negotiate a truce. Returning to Rome, Silva&#x27;s hopes to implement a truce in Judea are quashed by the Emperor Vespasian, because of political pressures in the Roman Senate. Silva is sent back to Judea, after securing the services of veteran Siege Commander Rubrius Gallus. Silva is informed that his second-in-command, general Marcus Quadratus, and head tribune Merovius, are spies for the emperor&#x27;s political enemy. While Silva is still in Rome, through the treachery of these two men, the truce is violently broken by the Romans.

===Part II===
Learning of the breaking of the truce upon his return from Rome, Silva marches the 5,000 men of the 10th Legion to the foot of Masada and lays a siege to the apparently impregnable fortress. He directs Quadratus and Merovius on a suicidal assault of the fortress, in order to remove them from his forces and make them an example to any others who share their political leanings. Rubrius Gallus directs that a ramp be built to almost the summit of the mountain, intent on breaking through the Masada walls with the aid of a 50-foot (15.24 m) siege tower that is being constructed out of sight of the rebels. 

When Eleazar successfully attacks the Roman soldiers building the ramp with catapulted stones, Silva quickly rounds up hundreds of Jews from the surrounding area to use as slaves to continue the work, believing correctly that Eleazar will not attack fellow Jews. This makes Eleazar change his tactics to psychological warfare, allowing the heat of the sun and revealing the surplus of water on Masada to demoralize the Roman troops. 

He acts to capitalize on the Romans&#x27; belief in reading the future from the entrails of sacrificed goats, leading a party through the Roman sentries at night to feed the goats maggots, knowing that their discovery during the rituals will be seen as a bad omen. Eleazar&#x27;s problems are further compounded by his own religious doubts and opposition from the more pacifist groups on Masada.

===Part III===
The political opportunist Pomponius Falco arrives and under the authority of the Emperor Vespasian relieves Silva as legion commander. Intent on ending the siege quickly through the use of terror, Falco orders Jewish slaves to be killed one by one, by catapulting them into the side of the mountain, until Eleazar surrenders. Eleazar, a religious skeptic, runs to the Masada synagogue and calls to God to stop the killing. 

Revolted by Falco&#x27;s barbaric actions, Silva forcibly takes back his command, stops the catapulting, and orders Falco placed under arrest. The cessation of Falco&#x27;s terror is seen by the Zealots as a response to Eleazar&#x27;s praying and affirmation of his leadership to them. Rubrius Gallus is killed by a Masadan arrow as he carries out measurements on the siege ramp, only living long enough to confirm his plans to his second in command.

===Part IV===
As the ramp nears completion, Eleazar faces the fact that the final confrontation with the Romans is not far off. The Zealots break into Herod&#x27;s Armory and begin to prepare for what they believe will be a straightforward storming of the fortress walls by the Romans. When the ramp is complete, the Romans wheel out the armoured siege tower and battering-ram. Eleazar then realizes that he had underestimated Silva&#x27;s strategy. As the tower begins moving up the ramp, Eleazar has his people build &quot;an inner wall that will absorb the blows of the ram and not shatter.&quot; 

Made from wooden beams from Herod&#x27;s Palace roof and packed with dirt, they finish it just as the tower reaches the top of the ramp. The Romans quickly break through the stone walls of the fortress, but the ram does nothing against the improvised inner wall. As the wall is made partly of wood, Silva orders his men to set fire to it. Deducing that it would take all night for the wall to burn through, Silva has his men stand down. The rest of the night is tense for both sides, as the fitful wind may as easily spread the blaze to the siege tower as burn down the inner wall. The next day, the Romans break into the fortress, only to discover that Eleazar and his people had all committed suicide during the night.

The closing line is said by a dispirited and despondent Silva, who mourns all that has been hoped and planned and lost by both sides whilst fighting for &quot;a rock, in the middle of a wasteland, on the shore of a poisoned sea...&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Masada&quot; was filmed on location at the site of the ancient fortress, in the Judean Desert, Israel. Remains of a ramp, created during the filming to simulate the ramp built by the Romans to take the fortress, can be seen at the site. ABC, concerned that the audience would be unfamiliar with the historical background of the story, commissioned a 30-minute documentary, &quot;Back To Masada&quot;. Starring Peter O&#x27;Toole, it recounts the history of the Jewish revolt against Rome. The network gave the documentary to its affiliates to run in the weeks before the premiere of the miniseries.

==Soundtrack==
The music for Parts I and II were composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Because of myriad production delays, Goldsmith was forced to move on to other previously contracted scoring commitments. Parts III and IV were composed by Morton Stevens, based on the themes and motifs Goldsmith had written.

In 1981, MCA Records released on vinyl and cassette a re-recording of selections of Goldsmith&#x27;s music performed by the UK&#x27;s National Philharmonic Orchestra under the composer&#x27;s baton. In 2011, Intrada Records issued a 2-CD set of the original recording of the complete score. In 2021, a more expansive 4-CD set was released, with alternates, unreleased material, and the original album version.

==Awards and nominations==
==Home media==
As was the case with &quot;Shogun&quot;, an edited, feature film-length version of the miniseries was made for theatrical release in other countries under the title &quot;The Antagonists&quot;. This was the version that was initially available on home video. The complete &quot;Masada&quot; miniseries first made it to the video market on four VHS tapes in 2001. 

A two-disc DVD release titled &quot;Masada ‚Äî The Complete Epic Mini-Series&quot; was released in September 2007. A Region 2 UK, two-disc DVD was released in January 2009.

<text>The Territory of Illinois was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 1, 1809, until December 3, 1818, when the southern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Illinois. Its capital was the former French village of Kaskaskia on the Mississippi River (which is still a part of the State of Illinois). The northern half of the territory, modern Wisconsin and parts of modern Minnesota and Michigan became part of the Territory of Michigan in 1818.

==History of the area==
The area was earlier known as &quot;Illinois Country&quot; (&quot;Pays des Illinois&quot;) while under French control, first as part of French Canada and then in its southern region as part of French Louisiana. The British gained authority over the region east of the Mississippi River from the French, with the 1763 Treaty of Paris marking the end of the French and Indian War and of the French North American colony of New France.

During the American Revolutionary War, Colonel George Rogers Clark took possession of the region for Virginia, which established the &quot;County of Illinois&quot; to exercise nominal governance over the area. Virginia later (1784) ceded nearly all of its land claims north of the Ohio River to the Federal government of the United States.

The area became part of the United States&#x27; Northwest Territory (from July 13, 1787, until July 4, 1800), and then part of the Indiana Territory. On February 3, 1809, the 10th United States Congress passed legislation establishing the Illinois Territory, after Congress received petitions from residents in the Mississippi River areas complaining of the difficulties of participating in territorial affairs in Indiana Territory. The portions of the Illinois Territory north of what became the State of Illinois were in 1818 annexed to Michigan Territory, and after several administrative arrangements became a part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (1837), the State of Wisconsin (1848), and a northern section of the State of Minnesota (1858).

==Boundaries==
The Illinois Territory originally included lands that became the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, the eastern portion of Minnesota, and the western portion of the upper peninsula of Michigan. As part of Illinois Territory‚Äôs statehood process, the Territory retroceded its Wisconsin lands. Congress reassigned the ceded lands to Michigan Territory.

The original boundaries of the Territory were defined as follows:
&quot;...all that part of the Indiana Territory which lies west of the Wabash river, and a direct line drawn from the said Wabash river and Post Vincennes, due north to the territorial line between the United States and Canada...&quot;

Kaskaskia was the territorial capital. The 1810 census showed a population of 12,282.

In the 1810 United States census, 2 counties in the Illinois Territory reported the following population counts:
== Officials == 
Ninian Edwards served as governor of the territory during its entire existence. Its secretaries were:
*Nathaniel Pope (1809‚Äì1816)
*Joseph Phillips (1816‚Äì1818)

==End of the Territory==

In 1818, the southern half of the territory was admitted to the United States as the State of Illinois. The northern half, modern Wisconsin and parts of modern Minnesota and Michigan became part of the Territory of Michigan.
