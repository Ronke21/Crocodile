<text>Bender (, ) or Bendery (, ; ), also known as Tighina (), is a city within the internationally recognized borders of Moldova under &quot;de facto&quot; control of the unrecognized Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria) (PMR) since 1992. It is located on the western bank of the river Dniester in the historical region of Bessarabia.

Together with its suburb Proteagailovca, the city forms a municipality, which is separate from Transnistria (as an administrative unit of Moldova) according to Moldovan law. Bender is located in the buffer zone established at the end of the 1992 War of Transnistria. While the Joint Control Commission has overriding powers in the city, Transnistria has &quot;de facto&quot; administrative control.

The fortress of Tighina was one of the important historic fortresses of the Principality of Moldova until 1812.

==Name==
First mentioned in 1408 as &quot;Tyagyanyakyacha&quot; () in a document in Old Slavonic (the term has Cuman origins), the town was known in the Middle Ages as Tighina in Romanian from Moldavian sources and later as &quot;Bender&quot; in Ottoman sources. The fortress and the city were called &quot;Bender&quot; for most of the time they were a rayah of the Ottomans (1538–1812), and during most of the time they belonged to the Russian Empire (1828–1917). They were known as &quot;Tighina&quot; (Тигина, ) in the Principality of Moldavia, in the early part of the Russian Empire period (1812–1828), and during the time the city belonged to Romania (1918–1940; 1941–1944).
The city is part of the historical region of Bessarabia. During the Soviet period the city was known in the Moldavian SSR as &quot;Bender&quot; in Romanian, written with the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet, as &quot;Bendery&quot; () in Russian and &quot;Bendery&quot; (Бенде́ри) in Ukrainian. Today the city is officially named &quot;Bender&quot;, but both &quot;Bender&quot; and &quot;Tighina&quot; are in use.

==History==

The town was first mentioned as an important customs post in a commerce grant issued by the Moldavian voivode Alexander the Good to the merchants of Lviv on October 8, 1408. The name &quot;Tighina&quot; is found in documents from the second half of the 15th century. Genoese merchants used to call the town &quot;Teghenaccio&quot;. The town was the main Moldavian customs point on the commercial road linking the country to the Crimean Khanate. During his reign of Moldavia, Stephen III had a small wooden fort built in the town to defend the settlement from Tatar raids.

In 1538, the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent conquered the town from Moldavia, and renamed it &quot;Bender&quot;. Its fortifications were developed into a full fortress under the same name under the supervision of the Turkish architect Koji Mimar Sinan. The Ottomans used it to keep the pressure on Moldavia. At the end of the 16th century several unsuccessful attempts to retake the fortress were made: in the summer of 1574 Prince John III the Terrible led a siege on the fortress, as did Michael the Brave in 1595 and 1600. About the same time the fortress was attacked by Zaporozhian Cossacks.

In the 18th century, the fort&#x27;s area was expanded and modernized by the prince of Moldavia Antioh Cantemir, who carried out these works under Ottoman supervision.

On the 5th of April 1710 the Bender Constitution (more commonly known as the Constitution of Pylyp Orlyk) was accepted in Bender. It established the principle of the separation of powers in government between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches almost 40 years before the publication of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of the Laws&quot;.
In 1713, the fortress, the town, and the neighboring village of Varnița were the site of skirmishes between Charles XII of Sweden, who had taken refuge there with the Cossack Hetman Ivan Mazepa after his defeat in the Battle of Poltava in 1709, and the Turks who wished to enforce the departure of the Swedish king.

During the second half of the 18th century, the fortress fell three times to the Russians during the Russo-Turkish Wars (in 1770, 1789, and in 1806 without a fight).

Along with Bessarabia, the city was annexed to the Russian Empire in 1812, and remained part of the Russian Governorate of Bessarabia until 1917. Many Ukrainians, Russians and Jews settled in or around Bender, and the town quickly became predominantly Russian-speaking. By 1897, speakers of Romanian made up only around 7% of Bender&#x27;s population, while 33.4% were Jews.

Tighina was part of the Moldavian Democratic Republic in 1917–1918, and after 1918, following the Union of Bessarabia with Romania, the city belonged to the Kingdom of Romania, where it was the seat of Tighina County. In 1918, it was shortly controlled by the Odesa Soviet Republic which was driven out by the Romanian army. The local population was critical of Romanian authorities; pro-Soviet separatism remained popular. On Easter Day, 1919, the bridge over the Dniester River was blown up by the French Army in order to block the Bolsheviks from coming to the city. In the same year, there was a pro-Soviet uprising in Bender, attempting to attach the city to the newly founded Soviet Union. Several hundred communist workers and Red Army members from Bessarabia, headed by , seized control in Bender on 27 May. However, the uprising was crushed on the same day by the Romanian army.
Romania launched a policy of Romanianization and the use of Russian was now discouraged and in certain cases restricted. In Bender, however, Russian continued to be the city&#x27;s most widely spoken language, being native to 53% of its residents in 1930. Although their share had doubled, Romanian-speakers made up only 15%.

Along with Bessarabia, the city was occupied by the Soviet Union on June 28, 1940, following an ultimatum. In the course of World War II, it was retaken by Romania in July 1941 (under which a treaty regarding the occupation of Transnistria was signed a month later), and again by the USSR in August 1944. Most of the city&#x27;s Jews were killed during the Holocaust, although Bender continued to have a significant Jewish community until most emigrated after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Jews were deported to Transnistria by the Romanian authorities in 1941, where most of them died.

In 1940–1941 and from 1944 to 1991 it was one of the four &quot;republican cities&quot;, not subordinated to a district, of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, one of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union. Since 1991, the city has been disputed between the Republic of Moldova and Transnistria. Due to the city&#x27;s key strategic location on the right bank of the Dniester river, from left-bank Tiraspol, Bender saw the heaviest fighting of the 1992 War of Transnistria during the Battle of Bender. Since then, it is controlled by Transnistrian authorities, although it has been formally in the demilitarized zone established at the end of the conflict.

Moldovan authorities control the commune of Varnița, a suburb on the fringe of the city to the north. Transnistrian authorities control the suburban communes of Proteagailovca, which borders the city to the west and Gîsca, which borders the city to the south-west. They also control Chițcani and Cremenciug, further to the south-east, while Moldovans are in control of Copanca, further to the south-east.

<doc id="449690" wikidata="Q5315842" url="?curid=449690" title="Duo Interpretation">
<text>Duo Interpretation, or often simply called Duo Interp, or just Duo, is an official speech event of Stoa USA, the National Speech and Debate Association, the National Catholic Forensics League, National Christian Forensics and Communications Association, American Forensics Association, and the National Forensics Association. The event involves a pair of performers acting out a literary piece or program under certain constraints, including not making eye contact nor touching their partner, and not using props. Pieces used often include published books, movies, short stories, plays, or poems. Participants may cut anything out of their piece, but cannot add any dialogue. This event can either be dramatic or humorous.

==Performance==
Like other interpretation events, props and costumes are not allowed, and the performers rely on things such as pantomime to convey what is happening. Duo Interpretation differs from the other events in the sense that the most important element is how well the duo partners work with each other. Partners are not allowed to look at each other or touch each other, so they must come up with other means to convey two characters talking to each other, physically interacting with each other, etc. Like in other interpretation events, the competitors will often pick a point on the wall in front of them to look at, pretending it is their subject. The stance is key in Duo Interpretation, where even the slightest shift could indicate a change.

Timing is also crucial when it comes to conveying physical interactions. For instance, if one partner lifts and swipes their hand as if to slap someone, the other partner must flinch and &quot;be hit&quot; in response. These movements must be timed carefully and are arguably the most challenging aspect of the event. Teams will often create complex &quot;choreography&quot; or &quot;tech&quot; (the term differs based on region) to showcase how well they can perform together.

Interpretation is highly valued in this event. Performances may be dramatic, humorous, or a blend of both. Performers often twist the meanings of words for comic effect or play on an unintentional pun. Other common ways to change the meaning of the text is to sing, dance, gesture, or simply change the tone of your voice.

Some movements, such as lying on the floor or kneeling with both legs, are prohibited at some tournaments, but performers can get around these rules by keeping one limb raised.

A duo can be no longer than ten minutes (any team exceeding ten minutes is given a thirty-second grace period before having any points deducted. There is no definite time minimum, but the unofficial consensus is that seven minutes is a good minimum time.)

==Elements of the Duo==
The duo usually begins with a teaser or short &quot;taste&quot; of the forthcoming duo. Typically, though there is no rule governing the order of these elements or their length, this lasts 1 to 2 minutes before the performers break character to perform their self-written &quot;intro&quot;. The intro serves to introduce the piece and its author, as well as provide the performers to simultaneously present the theme or storyline of their piece and infuse their own creativity. After the intro, which is usually brief due to original word restrictions, the duo resumes through its end.

<text>Dramatic Interpretation (often shortened to &quot;Dramatic Interp,&quot; &quot;Drama&quot; or just &quot;DI&quot;) is an event in National Speech and Debate Association (and NSDA-related) high school forensics competitions. In the National Christian Forensics and Communications Association and the National Catholic Forensic League, the event is combined with Humorous Interpretation to create the Dramatic Performance event. It consists of a piece from any published work, edited to fit within a 10-minute span with a 30-second grace period (it does not have a minimum and cannot be above 10:30).

In a typical round of DI, five to seven performers will each perform a &quot;cutting&quot; (excerpt) from a readily available, published (copyrighted or non-copyrighted) play, novel, or short story. As the name suggests, the cuttings are invariably from non-comedic (e.g., dramatic) works. Some performers select monologues, others may adopt the roles of many different characters, changing their tone, manner, and the position of their body to indicate a change in character.

After all of the competitors have performed, the judge (or judges) in the round will rank them from best to worst, and assign each of them a score. Contestants who score well will &quot;break&quot; out of preliminary rounds and continue to advance through octo/quarter/semi/final rounds if they continue to score well.

== NSDA Nationals ==

National Speech and Debate Association Nationals was hosted in Salt Lake City, Utah in 2016. National Champions are awarded a scholarship of US$1,000. To receive the title a competitor must have the lowest cumulative score throughout the duration of the tournament. The Dramatic Interpretation competitor to receive the lowest cumulative score in the final round is awarded the BAMA Bowl and a US$500 scholarship. The National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) National Tournament is the largest academic competition in the world.

=== Past NSDA Champions ===

== Rules ==

Dramatic Interpretation falls under the jurisdiction of events under the category defined as “Interpretation” by the National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA). These events are Humorous Interpretation, Duo Interpretation, and Program Oral Interpretation. Events that do not fall under the jurisdiction of the following rules include, but are not limited to Poetry, Prose, and Storytelling. The National Speech and Debate Associations rules are organized into categories of length, material, material availability, performance, re-use, and website approval submission process.

=== Length ===
The set time limit is ten minutes with a thirty-second period in which a student may go overtime with no penalty, colloquially referred to as a &#x27;grace period.&#x27;According to National Speech and Debate Association rules, a student who exceeds the ten minute and thirty-second time limit cannot be awarded the rank of 1st in the round. There is no minimum time limit.

=== Material and material availability ===
A student may choose from a single work of literature to perform. 
Acceptable forms of literature include:
* Novels
* Plays
* Anthologies where only one piece of literature is performed
* Poetry
* Song lyrics

=== Performance ===
In Dramatic Interpretation, Duo Interpretation, and Humorous Interpretation performers are not permitted to use any type of &quot;physical objects or costuming.&quot; 
In addition, students may not: 
* Adapt material for purposes other than transitional. Controversially, sub-point 5. An under Interpretations on the National Speech and Debate Association Manual has been used to disqualify national finalist and national champions during and after the final round at National Speech and Debate Association Nationals. (See Humorous Interpretation (Contestant H208))
* Rely on the use of scripts.

=== Re-use ===
Students may not perform the same work of literature at any National Speech and Debate Association tournament if they have already done so in a separate contestant year.

=== Website approval submission process ===
All piece selection is subject to online year-round review.

== Collegiate Dramatic Interpretation ==
In intercollegiate forensics, a competitor may use one or more theatrical scripts to craft a dramatic narrative involving one or multiple characters. The dramatic material can originate from a variety of sources, ranging from stage, screen, to radio. Unlike dramatic interpretation performances at the high school level, collegiate competitors are required to use a manuscript throughout their performance.

=== Past AFA Champions ===

Due to COVID-19, the 2020 tournament was canceled, resulting in no champion.

=== Past NFA Champions ===

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 tournament was canceled. However, the NFA permitted competitors in their senior year to submit recordings of their speeches for an asynchronous competition. The top performing student in each category was ranked as the Performance of Highest Distinction. The Performance of Highest Distinction in Dramatic Interpretation was awarded to Trijae from Bradley University.

<doc id="449695" wikidata="Q1514084" url="?curid=449695" title="Kylchap">
<text>The Kylchap steam locomotive exhaust system was designed and patented by French steam engineer André Chapelon, using a second-stage nozzle designed by the Finnish engineer Kyösti Kylälä, known as the &quot;Kylälä spreader&quot;, with the composite name KylChap being given the design.

==Construction==
The Kylchap exhaust consists of four stacked nozzles, the first exhaust nozzle (UK: blastpipe) blowing exhaust steam only and known as the primary nozzle, with a Chapelon design using four triangular jets. That exhausts into the second stage, the Kylälä spreader, which mixes the exhaust steam with some of the smokebox gases. That exhausts into a third stage, designed by Chapelon, which mixes the resulting steam/smokebox gases mixture with yet more smokebox gases. The four nozzles of the third stage exhaust into the fourth stage, the classic bell-mouth chimney (U.S.: stack).

==Theory==
It was Chapelon&#x27;s theory that such a multi-stage mixing and suction arrangement would be more efficient than the single-stage arrangement hitherto popular in steam locomotive draughting, in which an exhaust nozzle simply is fired up the middle of the stack bell-mouth. It would also ensure a more even flow through all the firetubes, rather than concentrating the suction on one area. The efficiency of the Kylchap system relied on careful proportioning of its components, and perfect alignment and concentricity.

==Examples of use==

===France===
Chapelon developed the Kylchap exhaust in 1926, and it was tested on compound &quot;Pacific&quot; locomotives of the 4500 and 3500 classes, and a simple expansion Pacific of the 3591 class, producing significant improvements in steaming and in one case a 41% reduction in back-pressure. However, it first came into prominence in 1929 when applied to compound Pacific No 3566 which combined enlarged steam circuits, increased superheat, feedwater heater, thermic syphon, Lentz poppet valves with double Kylchap exhaust extractors and chimneys. On a test in November 1929, the indicated horsepower (ihp) output was found to have increased by over 60%, from 1850 ihp to 3000 ihp, while its fuel and water consumption had improved by 25% compared to un-rebuilt engines of the same class. Those results made Chapelon&#x27;s name and 3566 became well known both within France and in most countries of the Western world.

===Great Britain===
Sir Nigel Gresley of the LNER became a proponent when he incorporated double Kylchap exhausts into four of his A4 Pacifics, including the world speed record holder &quot;Mallard&quot;. Arthur Peppercorn&#x27;s post-war LNER Pacifics also incorporated them, including preserved A2 532 &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, and the recreated &quot;A1 Tornado&quot;.

Originally, Kylchap exhausts were expensive and rarely used because the design was patented and subject to a licence fee but, after the patent expired, many more locomotives were retrofitted, including all the remaining A3 and A4 class, because the manufacturing cost was relatively low. The last steam express passenger locomotive built in Britain, &quot;Duke of Gloucester&quot;, was not fitted with a Kylchap exhaust in service, despite plans to do so, but one was fitted when it was renovated in preservation, after it was realised that poor draughting had been one of the biggest reasons behind its poor performance in its service days. A Kylchap exhaust is fitted to the Stainmore Railway Company industrial 0-4-0ST locomotive &quot;F.C. Tingey&quot;, located at Kirkby Stephen East station. Kylchap exhausts were also fitted to some British-built export locomotives, primarily Garratt locomotives for Africa. 

===Czechoslovakia===
The only other nation to take the Kylchap system in quantity was Czechoslovakia, where all later standard gauge steam locomotives used the design.

==Other exhaust systems==
The Kylchap was not the only advanced steam locomotive exhaust. Another design, the Lemaître, had some success in France and England. The noted Argentinian engineer, Livio Dante Porta, designed several: the Kylpor, Lempor and Lemprex systems. Several U.S. railroads, including the Norfolk &amp; Western, used a concentric nozzle known as the &quot;waffle iron exhaust&quot;.

<text>The Socialists&#x27; Party of Catalonia (, PSC–PSOE) is a social democratic political party in Catalonia, Spain, resulting from the merger of three parties: the Socialist Party of Catalonia–Regrouping, led by Josep Pallach i Carolà, the Socialist Party of Catalonia–Congress, and the Catalan Federation of the PSOE. It is the Catalan instance of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), and its Aranese section is Unity of Aran. The party had also been allied with federalist and republican political platform Citizens for Change (&quot;Ciutadans pel Canvi&quot;) until the 2010 election. PSC–PSOE has its power base in the Barcelona metropolitan area and the &quot;comarques&quot; of Tarragonès, Montsià, and Val d&#x27;Aran.

<doc id="449708" wikidata="Q2532714" url="?curid=449708" title="Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase">
<text>Acetaldehyde dehydrogenases () are dehydrogenase enzymes which catalyze the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetyl-CoA. This can be summarized as follows:

Acetaldehyde + NAD+ + Coenzyme A ↔ Acetyl-CoA + NADH + H+

In humans, there are three known genes which encode this enzymatic activity, &quot;ALDH1A1&quot;, &quot;ALDH2&quot;, and the more recently discovered &quot;ALDH1B1&quot; (also known as &quot;ALDH5&quot;). These enzymes are members of the larger class of aldehyde dehydrogenases.

The CAS number for this type of the enzyme is [9028-91-5].

==Structure==
Cysteine-302 is one of three consecutive Cys residues and is crucial to the enzyme&#x27;s catalytic function. The residue is alkylated by iodoacetamide in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes, with modifications to Cys-302 indicative of catalytic activity with other residues. Furthermore, the preceding sequence Gln-Gly-Gln-Cys is conserved in both isozymes for both human and horse, which is consistent with Cys-302 being crucial to catalytic function.

As discovered by site-directed mutagenesis, glutamate-268 is a key component of liver acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and is also critical to catalytic activity. Since activity in mutants could not be restored by addition of general bases, it&#x27;s suggested that the residue functions as a general base for activation of the essential Cys-302 residue.

In bacteria, acylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase forms a bifunctional heterodimer with metal-dependent 4-hydroxy-2-ketovalerate aldolase. Utilized in the bacterial degradation of toxic aromatic compounds, the enzyme&#x27;s crystal structure indicates that intermediates are shuttled directly between active sites through a hydrophobic intermediary channel, providing an unreactive environment in which to move the reactive acetaldehyde intermediate from the aldolase active site to the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase active site. Such communication between proteins allows for the efficient transfer substrates from one active site to the next.

==Evolution==
Although the two isozymes (ALDH1 and ALDH2) do not share a common subunit, the homology between the human ALDH1 and ALDH2 proteins is 66% at the coding nucleotide level and 69% at the amino acid level, which is found to be lower than the 91% homology between human ALDH1 and horse ALDH1. Such a finding is consistent with evidence suggesting the early evolutionary divergence between cytosolic and mitochondrial isozymes, as seen in the 50% homology between pig mitochondrial and cytosolic aspartate aminotransferases.

==Role in metabolism of alcohol==
In the liver, ethanol is converted into acetyl CoA by a two step process. In the first step, ethanol is converted to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. In the second step, the acetaldehyde is converted to acetyl CoA by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is more toxic than alcohol and is responsible for many hangover symptoms.

About 50% of people of Northeast Asian descent have a dominant mutation in their acetaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, making this enzyme less effective, which causes the alcohol flush reaction, also known as Asian flush syndrome. A similar mutation is found in about 5–10% of blond-haired blue-eyed people of Northern European descent. In these people, acetaldehyde accumulates after drinking alcohol, leading to symptoms of acetaldehyde poisoning, including the characteristic flushing of the skin and increased heart and respiration rates. Other symptoms can include severe abdominal and urinary tract cramping, hot and cold flashes, profuse sweating, and profound malaise. Individuals with deficient acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity are far less likely to become alcoholics, but seem to be at a greater risk of liver damage, alcohol-induced asthma, and contracting cancers of the oro-pharynx and esophagus due to acetaldehyde overexposure.
 This demonstrates that many of ethanol&#x27;s toxic effects are mediated via the acetaldehyde metabolite and can therefore be mitigated by substances such as fomepizole which effectively reduces the conversion rate of ethanol to acetaldehyde &quot;in vivo&quot;.

ALDH2, which has a lower KM for acetaldehydes than ALDH1 and acts predominantly in the mitochondrial matrix, is the main enzyme in acetaldehyde metabolism and has three genotypes. A single point mutation (G → A) at exon 12 of the ALDH2 gene causes a replacement of glutamate with lysine at residue 487, resulting in the ALDH2K enzyme. ALDH2K has an increased KM for NAD+, rendering it virtually inactive at cellular concentrations of NAD+. Since ALDH2 is a randomized tetramer, the hetero-mutated genotype is reduced to only 6% activity compared to wild type, while homo-mutated genotypes have virtually zero enzyme activity. The ALDH2-deficient subunit is dominant in hybridization with a wild type subunit, resulting in inactivation of the isozyme by interfering with catalytic activity and increasing turnover. ALDH2 genetic variation has been closely correlated with alcohol dependence, with heterozygotes at a reduced risk compared to wild type homozygotes and individual homozygotes for the ALDH2-deficient at a very low risk for alcoholism.

The drug disulfiram (Antabuse) prevents the oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetic acid and is used in the treatment of alcoholism. ALDH1 is strongly inhibited by disulfiram, while ALDH2 is resistant to its effect. The cysteine residue at 302 in ALDH1 and 200 in ALDH2 is implicated as a disulfiram binding site on the enzyme and serves as a disulfiram sensitive thiol site. Covalent binding of disulfiram to the thiol blocks the binding of one of the cysteine residues with iodoacetamide, thereby inactivating the enzyme and significantly lowering catalytic activity. Activity can be recovered by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol, although not with glutathione.

Metronidazole (Flagyl), which is used to treat certain parasitic infections as well as pseudomembranous colitis, causes similar effects to disulfiram. Coprine (which is an amino acid found in certain coprinoid mushrooms) metabolizes in vivo to 1-aminocyclopropanol which causes similar effects as well.

==Role in fat metabolism==
ALDH1 is involved in the metabolism of Vitamin A. Animal models suggest that absence of the gene is associated with protection against visceral adiposity.

<doc id="449709" wikidata="Q206535" url="?curid=449709" title="Prothonotary warbler">
<text>The prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family. It is named for its plumage which resembles the yellow robes once worn by papal clerks (named prothonotaries) in the Roman Catholic Church.

The prothonotary warbler is the only member of the genus Protonotaria and the only eastern warbler that nests in natural or artificial cavities.

==Taxonomy==
The prothonotary warbler was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Louisiana. Buffon coined the French name &quot;Le figuier protonotaire&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle,&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla citrea&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The prothonotary warbler is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Protonotaria&quot; that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird. The species is monotypic, no subspecies are recognised.

The genus name is from Late Latin &quot;protonotarius&quot;, meaning &quot;prothonotary&quot;, a notary attached to the Byzantine court who wore golden-yellow robes. The specific &quot;citrea&quot; is from Latin &quot;citreus&quot; meaning the colour &quot;citrine&quot;. It was once known as the golden swamp warbler.

A molecular phylogenetic study of the family Parulidae published in 2010 found that the prothonotary warbler was a sister species to Swainson&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Limnothlypis swainsonii&quot;).

== Description ==
The prothonotary warbler is long, weighs a mean , and has a wingspan of 22 cm (8.75 in). It has an olive-coloured back with blue-grey wings and tail, yellow underparts, a relatively long pointed bill, and black legs. The adult male has a bright orange-yellow head. Females and immature birds are duller and have a yellow head. In flight from below, the short, wide tail has a distinctive two-toned pattern, white at the base and dark at the tip.

== Distribution and habitat==
The prothonotary warbler mostly breeds in hardwood swamps in extreme southeastern Ontario and the eastern United States. However, it may nest near other bodies of water such as creeks, streams, ponds, and swimming pools.

The habitat of the warblers during migration is not well known. However, they are particularly prominent in Belize during spring migration.

The warblers winter in the West Indies, Central America and northern South America, primarily in Mangrove Swamps.

It is a rare vagrant to parts of the western United States, most notably California.

== Behavior and ecology ==

The prothonotary warbler is the only eastern warbler that nests in natural or artificial cavities, sometimes using old downy woodpecker holes. The male often builds several incomplete, unused nests in his territory; the female builds the real nest and lays 3–7 eggs.

The preferred foraging habitat is dense, woody streams, where the prothonotary warbler forages actively in low foliage, mainly for insects and snails.

The song of this bird is a simple, loud, ringing &quot;sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet-sweet&quot;. The call is a loud, dry chip, like that of a hooded warbler. Its flight call is a loud .

== Status ==

Prothonotary warblers are declining in numbers due to loss of habitat. They also experience parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (&quot;Molothrus ater&quot;), and are outcompeted for nest sites by the house wren (&quot;Troglodytes aedon&quot;). The warblers are listed as endangered in Canada, with approximately 30 individuals estimated to breed in Ontario as of 2008. The species persists in protected environments such as South Carolina&#x27;s Francis Beidler Forest, which is currently home to more than 2,000 pairs, the densest known population.

== In culture ==

=== Art and literature ===
John James Audubon&#x27;s painting of a prothonotary warbler is the third plate in &quot;The Birds of America&quot;.

The warbler has also been mentioned several times in literature. First, the warbler is mentioned in &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot; by Aldo Leopold as the &quot;[J]ewel of my disease-ridden woodlot&quot;, &quot;as proof that dead trees are transmuted into living animals, and vice versa. When you doubt the wisdom of this arrangement, take a look at the prothonotary.&quot; Second, Kurt Vonnegut described the warbler as &quot;the only birds that are housebroken in captivity&quot; in his novel, &quot;Jailbird.&quot;

=== The Hiss-Chambers Hearing ===
The prothonotary warbler became known to a wider audience in the 1940s as the bird that established a connection between Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee.

On August 3, 1948, in a hearing before the committee, Chambers accused Hiss of being a communist spy who sought to infiltrate the U.S. government. Two days later, Hiss testified before the committee and claimed, among other things, that Chambers&#x27; allegations were false and that he did not know Chambers.

However, future U.S. president, Richard Nixon, who was then a freshman congressman on the committee, became convinced that Hiss had committed perjury at the hearing. To verify this suspicion, the committee had Chambers appear before it again on August 7, 1948, to testify about his relationship with Hiss. At that hearing, Chambers testified that Hiss enjoyed bird-watching, and once bragged to Chambers about seeing a prothonotary warbler along the Potomac River. When Hiss appeared before the committee again, he haphazardly confirmed spotting a prothonotary warbler on the Potomac, causing many members of the committee to become convinced of the pair&#x27;s acquaintance. Ultimately, the Hiss-Chambers hearing led, in part, to Nixon&#x27;s political rise.

<text>Fota Wildlife Park is a wildlife park located on Fota Island, near Carrigtwohill, County Cork, Ireland. Opened in 1983, it is an independently funded, not-for-profit charity that is one of the leading tourism, wildlife and conservation attractions in Ireland. The park had an attendance of 455,559 visitors in 2017, making it the eleventh most popular paid attraction in Ireland for that year.

The park is home to nearly 30 mammal and 50 bird species. Some of the animals roam freely with the visitors, such as the ring-tailed lemurs and wallabies, while larger animals, including the giraffe and bison, live in paddocks with barriers that are intended to be unobtrusive for visitors to view the animals in a more natural environment. Fota Wildlife Park also has red pandas, tapirs, siamang gibbons and other types of animals.

==History and development==

===Foundation===
Fota Island was the former home of the Smith-Barry family, descendants of Normans who came to Ireland in the 12th century. While the family&#x27;s lands were originally more extensive, they dwindled over time until they were restricted to Fota Island. The estate was sold to University College Cork in 1975.

In the meantime, Dublin Zoo had reached maximum development with the space available. So in 1979, the director of Dublin Zoo proposed to the Zoological Society of Ireland Council that a wildlife park should be established, and the site at Fota Island was proposed. The same year it was formally agreed that the society would establish a wildlife park at Fota. University College Cork offered the land free of charge under a licence agreement. Fota Wildlife Park became a joint project of the Zoological Society of Ireland and University College Cork. Fundraising committees were set up in both Dublin and Cork. All the funds for the development were raised from public subscriptions, apart from a grant from Bord Fáilte for the perimeter fence.

The first animals started to arrive to Fota Wildlife Park in late 1982, and Fota Wildlife Park was opened in the summer of 1983 by the then President of Ireland, Dr. Patrick Hillery.

===Further development===

====Cheetah run====

Cheetahs, by their nature, will not work for food if they do not have to, and to exercise the animals and for behavioural enrichment reasons, the park installed a &quot;Cheetah Run&quot; in 2006. This device suspends food items on a wire that travels off the ground, at approximately .

====Education centre====
As part of the park&#x27;s conservation and education mandate, an education centre was opened, and runs courses on a range of topics including ecology and conservation. These are aimed at students at primary school and secondary school level, and the centre also runs summer camps during school holidays. Every year, an average of 15,000 students participate in Fota&#x27;s education programmes.

====Big cats and tropical house====
Fota Wildlife Park celebrated its 30th anniversary on 22 June 2013, and following this anniversary, announced the addition of a &quot;Tropical House&quot; and 27 acre &quot;Asian Sanctuary&quot;. As of 2017, habitats for Sumatran tigers, Indian rhinos, lion-tailed macaques and Asian lions have been opened in the &quot;Asian Sanctuary&quot;.

=== Awards ===
Fota Wildlife Park has been awarded &#x27;Best Family Day Out&#x27; for both Munster and Cork on several occasions. In November 2016, it was awarded &#x27;Experience Destination of the Year&#x27; by Customer Experience Insights (CXi). It is also in the Top 25 Zoos/Animal Parks in Europe in the 2015 Tripadvisor Travellers Choice Awards.

===Television Show===
As of early 2020, Fota Wildlife Park was featured in a documentary on Virgin Media Television. The series, called &quot;Fota: Into the Wild&quot;, was filmed at the park over two years as well as covering some of the broader conservation work the park&#x27;s employees are involved in (with some filming involving projects in Madagascar and Romania).

==Animals and their habitats==
The animals and birds at Fota Wildlife Park originate from a variety of habitats, a number of which are threatened with degradation through human activity. Fota runs the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for the Sudan cheetah and the European Studbook (ESB) for Lechwe (Kafue lechwe and Red lechwe).

A number of sections of the park are arranged by habitat and region. These areas include the &#x27;Asian Sanctuary&#x27; section, which houses the park&#x27;s Sumatran tiger, Visayan spotted deer, Visayan warty pig, lion-tailed macaque, Indian rhino, and Asiatic lion. The &#x27;African Savannah&#x27; paddock is home to ostrich, Grant&#x27;s zebra, scimitar-horned oryx and Rothschild&#x27;s giraffe breeds. When opened in 2014, the &#x27;Tropical House&#x27; housed three reptile, nine amphibian, 28 fish and 14 butterfly species among 340 tropical plants. A number of aquatic bird species (including penguins, Chilean flamingos, and great white pelicans) are found in wetlands around the park&#x27;s &#x27;Monkey Island&#x27; section, which itself houses black howler, Colombian spider monkeys, and Siamang gibbon and lemur species. Some mammals, like kangaroo, wallaby and mara species, roam somewhat freely within sections of the park.

<text>Fota (statutory spelling Foaty; ) is an island in Cork Harbour, County Cork, Ireland, just north of the larger island of Great Island. It is the home of Fota Wildlife Park—the only such zoo or animal park (besides Dublin Zoo) in the country—, the historical Fota House and Gardens, and the Fota Island Golf Club and Resort. The island comprises two townlands, both called Foaty; one is located in the civil parish of Clonmel (the western half of Great Island) and the other in Carrigtohill civil parish (on the mainland).

==Name==
Although &quot;Foaty&quot; is the spelling fixed in the nineteenth century by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, &quot;Fota&quot; is now more common. The origin of the name is uncertain. It may be of Hiberno-Norse origin, with second element Old Norse &quot;island&quot;; Donnchadh Ó Corráin suggests &quot;foot island&quot;, from its position at the mouth of the River Lee down from Cork city; some medieval references have an &quot;-r-&quot; in the name. Ó Corráin is sceptical of proposed Gaelic etymologies, &quot;sod house&quot;, &quot;warm sod&quot;, and &quot;decayed/withered&quot;.

==Fota House and Gardens==

===Fota House===

Fota House was the former home of the Smith-Barry family (Earls of Barrymore since 1627), descendants of Philip de Barry. The de Barry family came from Wales as part of the Norman invasion of Ireland. The family were granted lands at Fota and elsewhere in 1185. The family first resided at Barryscourt Castle, Carrigtwohill, then at Castlelyons where they held extensive lands. Fota House was originally a hunting lodge and became the family&#x27;s main residence in the 1820s when the architect, Sir Richard Morrison (1767–1849) and his son Vetruvius Morrison (1794–1838), created the present regency mansion with over 70 rooms.

The last member of the Smith-Barry family to live in Fota House was Dorothy Bell (1894–1975), daughter of Arthur Smith-Barry, 1st Baron Barrymore (1843–1925). She continued to develop and record the plant collections in the gardens and in the arboretum, which her family had started in the 1840s. On Bell&#x27;s death in 1975, the estate was sold to University College, Cork.

During the latter part of the 20th century, the house fell into some disrepair – culminating in the collapse of a ceiling. This closed the house to the public for some time. It was restored using EU, Irish government and private funding, prior to reopening in early 2002. In December 2007, the new Irish Heritage Trust took over responsibility for Fota House.

===Fota Gardens===

Fota Gardens are in the grounds of Fota House. These consist of a structured arboretum, walled garden and terraces. The gardens include rare and exotic shrubs and trees, along with an extensive rose garden.

The layout and structure of the arboretum and gardens date largely from the tenure of the Smith-Barry family, who recognised the significance of Fota&#x27;s sheltered location and warm soil — &quot;Fota&quot; is derived from the Irish &quot;Fód te&quot; meaning warm soil. The conditions are appropriate for the growing and cultivation of certain trees and exotic plants.

The development of the arboretum and gardens coincided with the great plant hunting expeditions around the world bringing back specimens from places such as Asia, South America and the Pacific coast of northwest America. Some of these rare plants found their way to Fota within a few years of their discovery.

In the 1840s, John Smith-Barry ensured that trees were well-spaced - enabling them to thrive with displays of seasonal colour. The family also recorded the plant collections throughout the 19th and most of the 20th century and this work of cataloguing, conservation and development continues today.

Many of these plant collections are arranged in association with the National Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, Dublin, and other botanic institutions such as the Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh, Scotland.

In 1996 the Irish state was given control of the arboretum and gardens. They are now administered by the Office of Public Works in conjunction with the Irish Heritage Trust.

==Fota Island Resort==
Fota Island Resort lies within a 780-acre estate (originally the Fota House demesne) comprising woodlands and landscaped areas. Its golf course consisted of three par 71 championship courses. These courses were named Deerpark (Par 71), Belvelly (Par 72) and Barryscourt (Par 73). Golf was first played in Fota Island in 1886. 

In 1993, Fota Island Golf Club was further developed by Christy O&#x27;Connor Junior (Irish Ryder Cup), and Peter McEvoy (two-time British Amateur Champion). The golf resort has hosted a number of tournaments, including the Irish Club Professional Championship, 2011 PGA Europro &quot;Audi Cork Irish Masters&quot;, and the Irish Open in 2001, 2002 and 2014.

In 2004 the resort was purchased by the &quot;Killeen Group&quot; (owners of Mount Juliet Golf &amp; Spa Hotel in Kilkenny), who invested to bring facilities in-line with European Tour standards. In November 2004, Killeen sold the club to the &quot;Fleming Group&quot;. In 2006, the Fleming Group completed construction of the 5-star Fota Island Hotel &amp; Spa as well self-catering accommodation.

On 27 September 2013, Fota Island Resort management announced a handover to new owners, the Kang Family Worldwide Group. The Kang family, originally from Hebei Province in China, acquired the 500-acre resort from the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).

==Fota Wildlife Park==
Opened in July 1983 by the President of Ireland, Dr Patrick Hillery, Fota Wildlife Park has the primary aim of conservation of global wildlife. It is a joint project of the Zoological Society of Ireland and University College, Cork.

Fota Wildlife Park has more than 70 species of exotic wildlife in open surroundings. Animals include ostriches, giraffes, kangaroos, zebras and antelope. Most of the animals who inhabit the island are allowed to roam throughout more than of mature grassland, with the exception of the cheetahs and other predators, which have fenced enclosures. Ring-tailed lemurs, wallabies and other animals freely roam the park.

Many of the animals at Fota are under threat of extinction, and Fota Wildlife Park is involved in breeding programs for these endangered species, as well as being a breeding source for other zoos around the world. An Asian sanctuary opened between in 2015, and includes enclosures for tigers and other animals. In 2017 the park was the eleventh most popular paid attraction in Ireland, with 455,559 visitors that year.

==Transport==
By rail, the island is served by Fota railway station, which opened on 1 July 1865.

By road, Fota lies just south of the N25 road from Cork to Rosslare. It is directly accessible via Cobh and Carrigtwohill on the R624 regional road - which runs from Tullagreen (N25 Southside Carrigtwohill-Cobh interchange) to Cobh town centre.

<text>A rostrum camera is a specially designed camera used in television production and filmmaking to animate a still picture or object. It consists of a moving lower platform on which the article to be filmed is placed, while the camera is placed above on a column. Many visual effects can be created from this simple setup, although it is most often used to add interest to static objects. The camera can, for example, traverse across a painting, and using wipes and zooms, change a still picture into a sequence suitable for television or movie productions.

The controls of the camera differ considerably from those of a regular motion picture camera. The key to its operation is one or more frame counters. These enable the camera operator to roll the film backwards and forwards through the film gate, and to know exactly which frame is being exposed at a given time. Also key is the way the operation of the shutter is completely independent from the film transport, so a given frame may be exposed a number of different times, or not at all. Very long exposures are also possible, so that title streaks, zooms and other special effects can be created by keeping the shutter open while moving the camera head up and down the column; rotating or moving the lower platform from side to side; or doing both at the same time. For some of these types of effects, the artwork may be a transparency, which is back-lit by a light source below the table surface.

The camera&#x27;s film gate is also different from that of a regular motion picture camera, in that fixed pins hold each film frame in place while it is being exposed. This &quot;pin-registered&quot; gate means that the film can be wound backwards and forwards through the camera head many times, but will always return to exactly the same place without any shifts of the film frame. Such precise repeatability is required for multiple exposures, traveling mattes, title superimposition, and a range of other techniques.

The camera is connected to a mechanism that allows an operator to precisely control the movement of the lower platform, as well as of the camera head. The lower platform is often called an animation compound table. In a modern setup, a computer controls the horizontal, vertical and rotational movements of the compound table, the &quot;zooming&quot; (lowering and rising) of the camera head on the column, and the lens bellows.

Early rostrum cameras were largely adapted from existing equipment, but after World War II industry pioneer John Oxberry made some key refinements to the design. His company, Oxberry Products, then went on to produce some of the best-known models, which were used by leading film and animation studios around the world. Other manufacturers included Acme, Forox, Marron Carrel, Mangum Sickles, the German company Crass, and Neilson-Hordell in the UK. Some of these machines were somewhat smaller and more cheaply built than the Oxberry models, but were ideal for general purpose work, such as producing titles and copying artwork to film.

In the UK, Ken Morse is well known for his rostrum camera work in television and film, and his name is often seen in the closing credits of UK productions. In United States–based documentary film making, the use of a rostrum camera for a particular type of panning and zooming effect is sometimes called the Ken Burns effect.

An animation camera or animation stand, used for single frame shooting on film is similar. With a multiplane camera, a 3-dimensional effect can be obtained.

<doc id="449715" wikidata="Q19819228" url="?curid=449715" title="Afghan Girl">
<text>Afghan Girl is a 1984 photographic portrait of Sharbat Gula, an Afghan refugee in Pakistan during the Soviet–Afghan War. The photograph, taken by American photojournalist Steve McCurry near the Pakistani city of Peshawar, appeared on the June 1985 cover of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. While the portrait&#x27;s subject initially remained unknown, she was identified by early 2002: Gula, an ethnic Pashtun from Afghanistan&#x27;s Nangarhar Province, was a 12-year-old child residing in Pakistan&#x27;s Nasir Bagh.

In light of the Cold War, the portrait was described as the &quot;First World&#x27;s Third World &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;&quot; in reference to the 16th-century painting of the same name by Leonardo da Vinci. Gula&#x27;s image became &quot;emblematic&quot; in some social circles as the &quot;refugee girl/woman located in some distant camp&quot; that was deserving of compassion from the Western viewer, and also as a symbol of Afghanistan to the West. CNN called it the &#x27;world&#x27;s most famous photograph&#x27;.

==Cover photo for &quot;National Geographic&quot;==
Sharbat Gula was one of the students in an informal school at the Nasir Bagh refugee camp in 1984. Her photograph was taken by National Geographic Society photographer Steve McCurry, on Kodachrome 64 color slide film, with a Nikon FM2 camera and Nikkor 105mm Ai-S F2.5 lens. The pre-print retouching of the photograph was done by Graphic Art Service, based in Marietta, Georgia. McCurry did not record the name of the person he had photographed.

The photograph, entitled &quot;Afghan Girl&quot;, appeared on the June 1985 cover of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. The image of her face, with a red scarf draped loosely over her head and her eyes staring directly into the camera, was named &quot;the most recognized photograph&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s history, and the cover is one of &quot;National Geographic&#x27;s&quot; best known. &quot;American Photo&quot; magazine says the image has an &quot;unusual combination of grittiness and glamour&quot;. Gula&#x27;s green eyes have been the subject of much commentary.

==Sharbat Gula==
McCurry made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1990s to find and identify the subject of the photograph. In January 2002, a &quot;National Geographic&quot; team traveled to Afghanistan to find her. Upon learning that the Nasir Bagh refugee camp was soon to close, McCurry inquired of its remaining residents, one of whom knew Gula&#x27;s brother and was able to send word to her hometown. Several women falsely identified themselves as the &quot;Afghan Girl&quot;. In addition, after being shown the 1984 photograph, several young men erroneously identified her as their wife.

The team found Gula, then around age 30, in a remote region of Afghanistan; she had returned to her native country from the refugee camp in 1992. Her identity was confirmed by John Daugman using iris recognition. She recalled being photographed. She had been photographed on only three occasions: in 1984 and during the search for her when a &quot;National Geographic&quot; producer took the identifying photographs that led to the reunion with McCurry. She had never seen &quot;Afghan Girl&quot; until it was shown to her in 2002.

A devout Muslim, Gula normally wears a burqa and was hesitant to meet McCurry, as he was a male from outside the family. After finding Gula, &quot;National Geographic&quot; covered the costs of medical treatment for her family and a pilgrimage to Mecca.

Pashtun by ethnicity and from a rural background, Gula&#x27;s family fled their village in eastern Nangarhar during the Soviet Union&#x27;s bombing of Afghanistan when she was around six years old. Along with her father, brother, and three sisters, she walked across the mountains to Pakistan to the Nasir Bagh refugee camp in 1984 where she was photographed.

On 26 October 2016, Pakistan&#x27;s Federal Investigation Agency arrested Gula for living in Pakistan with forged documents. She was sentenced to fifteen days in detention and deported to Afghanistan. Following the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2021, women&#x27;s rights were curtailed under their conservative rule, and high-profile women were threatened or intimidated. The &quot;Afghan Girl&quot; photograph had made Gula globally famous, hence her prominence put her in danger. She sought assistance to leave the country, and was evacuated to Italy with the support of its government in response to appeals from nonprofit organizations.

==Criticism==
A 2019 article from &quot;The Wire&quot; described a 2002 interview where Gula stated that she was angered by the photograph being taken and published without her consent. The writer for &quot;The Wire&quot; suggests that this is because &quot;it is not welcome for a girl of traditional Pashtun culture to reveal her face, share space, make eye contact and be photographed by a man who does not belong to her family.&quot;
==Legacy==

Interest in the photograph increased after the 9/11 attacks, when the George W. Bush administration began promoting Afghan women&#x27;s rights during the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan. Photographs of Gula were featured as part of a cover story on her life in the April 2002 issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; and she was the subject of a television documentary, &quot;Search for the Afghan Girl&quot;, that aired in March 2002. In recognition of her, &quot;National Geographic&quot; set up the Afghan Girls Fund, a charitable organization with the goal of educating Afghan girls and young women. In 2008, the fund&#x27;s scope was broadened to include boys and the name was changed to Afghan Children&#x27;s Fund.

<doc id="449718" wikidata="Q718540" url="?curid=449718" title="Gagaku">
<text>is a type of Japanese classical music that was historically used for imperial court music and dances. was developed as court music of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, and its near-current form was established in the Heian period (794–1185) around the 10th century. Today, it is performed by the Board of Ceremonies in the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

Gagaku consists of three primary repertoires:
#Native Shinto religious music and imperial songs and dance, called 
#Vocal music based on native folk poetry, called 
#Songs and dance based on foreign-style music
##A Chinese, Vietnamese and Indian form (specifically Tang dynasty), called 
##A Korean and Manchurian form, called 

, like , employs the yo scale, a pentatonic scale with ascending intervals of two, three, two, two, and three semitones between the five scale tones. Artistically it differs from the music of the corresponding Chinese form () which is a term reserved for ceremonial music.

==History==
The prototype of was introduced into Japan with Buddhism from China. In 589, Japanese official diplomatic delegations were sent to China (during the Sui dynasty) to learn Chinese culture, including Chinese court music. By the 7th century, the (the 13-stringed zither) and the (a short-necked lute) had been introduced into Japan from China. Various instruments, including these two, were the earliest used to play .

Even though the Japanese use the same term, ( in Mandarin Chinese), the form of music imported from China was primarily banquet music () rather than the ceremonial music of the Chinese . The importation of music peaked during the Tang dynasty, and these pieces are called (Tang music). pieces that originated at a time earlier than the Tang dynasty are called (ancient music), while those originating after the Tang dynasty are called (new music). The term itself was first recorded in 701, when the first imperial academy of music was established.

Music from the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo had been recorded as early as 453 AD, and was eventually used as a term that covered all Korean pieces, the Goguryeo kingdom being referred to as Koma in Japanese. and became established in southern Japan during the Nara period (710–794). In 736, music from India and Vietnam were also introduced, known as and respectively.

During the Nara period in the 8th century, was performed at national events, such as the erection of the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple, by organizing performance groups at large temples.

From the 9th century to the 10th century, during the Heian period, traditional was developed further, becoming distinctly Japanese in style through its fusion with musical styles indigenous to Japan, changing it greatly. The form of was almost completed by the fusion of , , and which were introduced from Asian countries, with , traditional Japanese music, and , songs born in the Heian period. During this period, many pieces of music were created and foreign-style music was rearranged and renewed. was also reorganized, and foreign-style music was classified into categories called and . Chinese, Vietnamese and Indian style was classified as , and Korean and Manchurian style was classified as . and were also included in the category of .

The popularity of reached its peak between the 9th and 10th centuries, when court aristocracy began to hold private concerts, but declined in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) when the power of the court aristocracy became diminished while that of the samurai rose. was played by musicians who belonged to hereditary guilds. During the Kamakura period, military rule was imposed and was rarely performed at court. At this time, there were three guilds, based in Osaka, Nara and Kyoto.

Due to the Ōnin War, a civil war from 1467 to 1477 during the Muromachi period, ensembles ceased to perform in Kyoto for about 100 years. In the Edo period, the Tokugawa shogunate revived and reorganized the court-style ensembles, the direct ancestors of the present ensembles.

After the Meiji Restoration of 1868, musicians from all three guilds came to the capital and their descendants make up most of the current Tokyo Imperial Palace Music Department. By that time, the present ensemble composition had been established, consisting of three wind instruments – , , and (bamboo mouth organ used to provide harmony) – and three percussion instruments – (small drum), (metal percussion), and (drum) or (large drum), supplemented by two string instruments – and .

 also accompanies classical dance performances called . It may be used in religious ceremonies in some Buddhist temples.

In 1955, the Japanese government recognized and as important National Treasures.

Today, is performed in three ways:
*as , concert music for winds, strings and percussion,
*as , or dance music, for which the stringed instruments are omitted.
*as , singing to the accompaniment of a musical instrument, classified into 10 categories.

 survives only as .

Contemporary ensembles, such as , perform contemporary compositions for instruments. This subgenre of contemporary works for instruments, which began in the 1960s, is called . 20th-century composers such as Tōru Takemitsu have composed works for ensembles, as well as individual instruments. In January 2015 the Reigakusha Ensemble and Ensemble Modern performed together &quot;Music with silent aitake&#x27;s&quot; by Belgian composer Frederic D&#x27;Haene, making and Western music co-exist.

==Instruments used==
Wind, string and percussion instruments are essential elements of gagaku music. Some instruments, such as Haishō, Gogen biwa, Kugo had been removed from the ensemble during Heian period and reconstructed based on the old documents and some remains of the instruments in the Shōsō-in during Showa Era.

==Influence on Western music==
Beginning in the 20th century, several western classical composers became interested in gagaku, and composed works based on gagaku. Most notable among these are Henry Cowell (&quot;Ongaku&quot;, 1957), La Monte Young (numerous works of drone music, but especially &quot;Trio for Strings&quot;, 1958), Alan Hovhaness (numerous works), Olivier Messiaen (&quot;Sept haïkaï&quot;, 1962), Lou Harrison (&quot;Pacifika Rondo&quot;, 1963), Benjamin Britten (&quot;Curlew River&quot;, 1964), Bengt Hambraeus (&quot;Shogaku&quot;, from &quot;Tre Pezzi per Organo&quot;, 1967), Ákos Nagy (Veiled wince flute quartet 2010), Jarosław Kapuściński (numerous works), Sarah Peebles (numerous works), Michiko Toyama (&quot;Waka&quot;, 1960), and Tim Hecker (&quot;Konoyo&quot;, 2018).

One of the most important gagaku musicians of the 20th century, Masataro Togi (who served for many years as chief court musician), instructed American composers such as Alan Hovhaness and Richard Teitelbaum in the playing of gagaku instruments.

==Other cultural influence==
The American poet Steve Richmond developed a unique style based on the rhythms of gagaku. Richmond heard gagaku music on records at U.C.L.A.&#x27;s Department of Ethnomusicology in the early 1960s. In a 2009 interview with writer Ben Pleasants, Richmond claimed he had written an estimated 8,000–9,000 gagaku poems.

<doc id="449719" wikidata="Q1493441" url="?curid=449719" title="Gait analysis">
<text>Gait analysis is the systematic study of animal locomotion, more specifically the study of human motion, using the eye and the brain of observers, augmented by instrumentation for measuring body movements, body mechanics, and the activity of the muscles. Gait analysis is used to assess and treat individuals with conditions affecting their ability to walk. It is also commonly used in sports biomechanics to help athletes run more efficiently and to identify posture-related or movement-related problems in people with injuries.

The study encompasses quantification (introduction and analysis of measurable parameters of gaits), as well as interpretation, i.e. drawing various conclusions about the animal (health, age, size, weight, speed etc.) from its gait pattern.

==History==
The pioneers of scientific gait analysis were Aristotle in &quot;De Motu Animalium&quot; (On the Gait of Animals) and much later in 1680, Giovanni Alfonso Borelli also called &quot;De Motu Animalium (I et II)&quot;. In the 1890s, the German anatomist Christian Wilhelm Braune and Otto Fischer published a series of papers on the biomechanics of human gait under loaded and unloaded conditions.

With the development of photography and cinematography, it became possible to capture image sequences that reveal details of human and animal locomotion that were not noticeable by watching the movement with the naked eye. Eadweard Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey were pioneers of these developments in the early 1900s. For example, serial photography first revealed the detailed sequence of the horse &quot;gallop&quot;, which was usually misrepresented in paintings made prior to this discovery.

Although much early research was done using film cameras, the widespread application of gait analysis to humans with pathological conditions such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and neuromuscular disorders, began in the 1970s with the availability of video camera systems that could produce detailed studies of individual patients within realistic cost and time constraints. The development of treatment regimes, often involving orthopedic surgery, based on gait analysis results, advanced significantly in the 1980s. Many leading orthopedic hospitals worldwide now have gait labs that are routinely used to design treatment plans and for follow-up monitoring.

Development of modern computer based systems occurred independently during the late 1970s and early 1980s in several hospital based research labs, some through collaborations with the aerospace industry. Commercial development soon followed with the emergence of commercial television and later infrared camera systems in the mid-1980s.

==Process and equipment==

A typical gait analysis laboratory has several cameras (video or infrared) placed around a walkway or a treadmill, which are linked to a computer. The patient has markers located at various points of reference of the body (e.g., iliac spines of the pelvis, ankle malleolus, and the condyles of the knee), or groups of markers applied to half of the body segments. The patient walks down the catwalk or the treadmill and the computer calculates the trajectory of each marker in three dimensions. A model is applied to calculate the movement of the underlying bones. This gives a complete breakdown of the movement of each joint. One common method is to use Helen Hayes Hospital marker set, in which a total of 15 markers are attached on the lower body. The 15 marker motions are analyzed analytically, and it provides angular motion of each joint.

To calculate the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, also known as force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure). The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with pedobarography equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle. The computational method for this is known as inverse dynamics.

This use of kinetics, however, does not result in information for individual muscles but muscle groups, such as the extensor or flexors of the limb. To detect the activity and contribution of individual muscles to movement, it is necessary to investigate the electrical activity of muscles. Many labs also use surface electrodes attached to the skin to detect the electrical activity or electromyogram (EMG) of muscles. In this way it is possible to investigate the activation times of muscles and, to some degree, the magnitude of their activation—thereby assessing their contribution to gait. Deviations from normal kinematic, kinetic or EMG patterns are used to diagnose specific pathologies, predict the outcome of treatments, or determine the effectiveness of training programs

==Factors and parameters==
The gait analysis is modulated or modified by many factors, and changes in the normal gait pattern can be transient or permanent. The factors can be of various types:
* Extrinsic: such as terrain, footwear, clothing, cargo
* Intrinsic: sex, weight, height, age, etc.
* Physical: such as weight, height, physique
* Psychological: personality type, emotions
* Physiological: anthropometric characteristics, i.e., measurements and proportions of body
* Pathological: for example trauma, neurological diseases, musculoskeletal anomalies, psychiatric disorders

The parameters taken into account for the gait analysis are as follows:
* Step length
* Stride length
* Cadence
* Speed
* Dynamic base
* Progression line
* Foot angle
* Hip angle
* Squat performance

== Techniques ==
Gait analysis involves measurement, where measurable parameters are introduced and analyzed, and interpretation, where conclusions about the subject (health, age, size, weight, speed, etc.) are drawn. The analysis is the measurement of the following:

=== Temporal / spatial ===

It consists of the calculation of speed, the length of the rhythm, pitch, and so on. These measurements are carried out through:
* Stopwatch and marks on the ground.
* Walking on a pressure mat.
* Range laser sensors scanning a plane a few centimeters above the floor.
* Inertial sensors and software to interpret 3D gyroscopes and 3D accelerometric data.

=== Kinematics ===
# Chronophotography is the most basic method for recording of movement. Strobe lighting at known frequency has been used in the past to aid in the analysis of gait on single photographic images.
# Cine film or video recordings using footage from single or multiple cameras can be used to measure joint angles and velocities. This method has been aided by the development of analysis software that greatly simplifies the analysis process and allows for analysis in three dimensions rather than two dimensions only.
# Passive marker systems, using reflective markers (typically reflective balls), allows for accurate measurement of movements using multiple cameras (typically five to twelve cameras), simultaneously. The cameras utilize high-powered strobes (typically red, near infrared or infrared) with matching filters to record the reflection from the markers placed on the body. Markers are located at palpable anatomical landmarks. Based on the angle and time delay between the original and reflected signal, triangulation of the marker in space is possible. Software is used to create three dimensional trajectories from these markers that are subsequently given identification labels. A computer model is then used to compute joint angles from the relative marker positions of the labeled trajectories. These are also used for motion capture in the motion picture industry.
# Active marker systems are similar to the passive marker system but use &quot;active&quot; markers. These markers are triggered by the incoming infra red signal and respond by sending out a corresponding signal of their own. This signal is then used to triangulate the location of the marker. The advantage of this system over the passive one is that individual markers work at predefined frequencies and therefore, have their own &quot;identity&quot;. This means that no post-processing of marker locations is required, however, the systems tend to be less forgiving for out-of-view markers than the passive systems.
# Inertial (cameraless) systems based on MEMS inertial sensors, biomechanical models, and sensor fusion algorithms. These full-body or partial body systems can be used indoors and outdoors regardless of lighting conditions.

=== Markerless gait capture ===
* Markerless gait capture systems utilize one or more color cameras or 2.5D depth sensors (i.e. Kinect) to directly calculate the body joint positions from a sequence of images. The markerless system allows non-invasive human gait analysis in a natural environment without any marker attachment. Eliminating markers can expand the applicability of human gait measurement and analysis techniques, considerably reduce the preparation time, and enable efficient and accurate motion assessment in all kinds of applications. Currently, the main markerless system is the video-based motion capture with monocular camera or multiple camera studio. Nowadays, the depth sensor-based gait analysis for clinical applications becomes more and more popular. Since depth sensors can measure the depth information and provide a 2.5D depth image, they have effectively simplified the task of foreground/background subtraction and significantly reduced pose ambiguities in monocular human pose estimation.

===Pressure measurement===
Pressure measurement systems are an additional way to measure gait by providing insights into pressure distribution, contact area, center of force movement and symmetry between sides. These systems typically provide more than just pressure information; additional information available from these systems are force, timing and spatial parameters. Different methods for assessing pressure are available, like a pressure measurement mat or walkway (longer in length to capture more foot strikes), as well as in-shoe pressure measurement systems (where sensors are placed inside the shoe). Many pressure measurement systems integrate with additional types of analysis systems, like motion capture, EMG or force plates to provide a comprehensive gait analysis.

===Kinetics===
Is the study of the forces involved in the production of movements.

===Dynamic electromyography===
Is the study of patterns of muscle activity during gait.

==Applications==
Gait analysis is used to analyze the walking ability of humans and animals, so this technology can be used for the following applications:

===Medical diagnostics===
Pathological gait may reflect compensations for underlying pathologies, or be responsible for causation of symptoms in itself. Cerebral palsy and stroke patients are commonly seen in gait labs. The study of gait allows diagnoses and intervention strategies to be made, as well as permitting future developments in rehabilitation engineering. Aside from clinical applications, gait analysis is used in professional sports training to optimize and improve athletic performance.

Gait analysis techniques allow for the assessment of gait disorders and the effects of corrective orthopedic surgery. Options for treatment of cerebral palsy include the artificial paralysis of spastic muscles using Botox or the lengthening, re-attachment or detachment of particular tendons. Corrections of distorted bony anatomy are also undertaken (osteotomy).

===Chiropractic and osteopathic uses===
Observation of gait is also beneficial for diagnoses in chiropractic and osteopathic professions as hindrances in gait may be indicative of a misaligned pelvis or sacrum. As the sacrum and ilium biomechanically move in opposition to each other, adhesions between the two of them via the sacrospinous or sacrotuberous ligaments (among others) may suggest a rotated pelvis. Both doctors of chiropractic and osteopathic medicine use gait to discern the listing of a pelvis and can employ various techniques to restore a full range of motion to areas involved in ambulatory movement. Chiropractic adjustment of the pelvis has shown a trend in helping restore gait patterns as has osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT).

===Comparative biomechanics===
By studying the gait of non-human animals, more insight can be gained about the mechanics of locomotion, which has diverse implications for understanding the biology of the species in question as well as locomotion more broadly.

=== Gait as biometrics ===
Gait recognition is a type of behavioral biometric authentication that recognizes and verifies people by their walking style and pace. Advances in gait recognition have led to the development of techniques for forensics use since each person can have a gait defined by unique measurements such as the locations of ankle, knee, and hip.

===Surveillance===
In 2018, there were reports that the Government of China had developed surveillance tools based on gait analysis, allowing them to uniquely identify people, even if their faces are obscured.

==Popular media==
* G. K. Chesterton premised one of his Father Brown mysteries, &quot;The Queer Feet&quot;, on gait recognition.
* Cory Doctorow makes much of gait recognition as a security technique used in a high school in his book &quot;Little Brother&quot;.
* Arthur Conan Doyle has Sherlock Holmes use gait analysis to identify the height of the &quot;Rache&quot; killer in &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;.
* The movie &quot;&quot; features gait analysis, in a scene where Benji Dunn must infiltrate a facility that uses gait analysis software as part of its security protocol.

<doc id="449731" wikidata="Q3107331" url="?curid=449731" title="Bright Future (film)">
<text>is a 2003 Japanese drama film written, directed, and edited by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, starring Tadanobu Asano, Joe Odagiri and Tatsuya Fuji. It was entered into the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.

== Plot ==
Yuji Nimura (Joe Odagiri) and Mamoru Arita (Tadanobu Asano) are two factory workers, who are constantly irritated by their boss, Fujiwara (Takashi Sasano). Mamoru entrusts his poisonous jellyfish, which he has been acclimating to fresh water, to Nimura.

Nimura goes to Fujiwara&#x27;s house one night with the intent of hurting Fujiwara, only to find that Mamoru has already murdered him and his wife. Mamoru is convicted of the murder but commits suicide on death row, leaving Nimura a private message to &quot;go ahead.&quot; Meanwhile, Mamoru&#x27;s jellyfish escapes its tank and reproduces in the waterways of the city. 

Mamoru&#x27;s divorced father, Shinichiro (Tatsuya Fuji), takes Nimura in. Nimura helps with Shinichiro&#x27;s electronics salvage business, but leaves after the two argue about Nimura&#x27;s future.

Nimura takes a job at his sister&#x27;s office and later falls in with a gang of youths. He helps the group gain after-hours access to the office, which they rob and vandalize. The police arrest the gang but Nimura escapes.

With nowhere to go, Nimura seeks refuge with Shinichiro who forgives him, saying that he can &quot;stay forever.&quot; Later, the two see a large school of jellyfish in a river, making their way to the sea. Excitedly, Shinichiro wades into the river to see the jellyfish and is stung, rendering him unconscious though not badly hurt.

The final tracking shot follows the gang of youths as they aimlessly wander the street.

==Cast==
* Joe Odagiri – Yûji Nimura
* Tadanobu Asano – Mamoru Arita
* Tatsuya Fuji – Shinichiro Arita
* Takashi Sasano – Mr. Fujiwara
* Marumi Shiraishi – Mrs. Fujiwara

==Reception==
Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; gave &quot;Bright Future&quot; 2 and a half stars out of 4. Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a favorable review, saying: &quot;One of the pleasures of Mr. Kurosawa&#x27;s films is how casually he tosses in ideas about contemporary life, the state of the family, the place of technology, all while steadily shredding your nerves.&quot; Scott Tobias of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt that the final tracking shot of the film is mesmerizing.

<doc id="449732" wikidata="Q206897" url="?curid=449732" title="1938 New England hurricane">
<text>The 1938 New England Hurricane (also referred to as the Great Long Island - New England Hurricane and the Long Island Express Hurricane) was one of the deadliest and most destructive tropical cyclones to strike the United States. The storm formed near the coast of Africa on September 9, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Long Island on Wednesday, September 21. It is estimated that the hurricane killed 682 people, damaged or destroyed more than 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at $306 million ($4.7 billion in 2024). Also, numerous others estimate the real damage between $347 million and almost $410 million. Damaged trees and buildings were still seen in the affected areas as late as 1951. It remains the most powerful and deadliest hurricane to ever strike New York and New England in history, perhaps eclipsed in landfall intensity only by the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.

The storm developed into a tropical depression on September 9 off the coast of West Africa, but the United States Weather Bureau was unaware that a tropical cyclone existed until September 16 when ships reported strong winds and rough seas 350 miles northeast of San Juan; by then, it was already a well-developed hurricane and had tracked westward toward the southeastern Bahamas. It reached hurricane strength on September 15 and continued to strengthen to a peak intensity of near the southeastern Bahamas four days later, making it a Category 5-equivalent hurricane. The storm was propelled northward, rapidly paralleling the East Coast before making landfalls on Long Island, New York and Connecticut as a Category 3 hurricane on September 21, with estimated sustained winds of 115–120 mph. After moving inland, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated over Ontario on September 23.

==Meteorological history==

The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project analyzed the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season in 2012, and Weather Bureau forecaster Ivan Ray Tannehill noted that the knowledge of the storm&#x27;s existence at the time remained tenuous until September 17 when the cyclone had already increased to a hurricane. Based on land and marine observations, the reanalysis project concluded that the 1938 hurricane began as a tropical depression just off the coast of West Africa at 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. Eastern Standard Time) on September 9, becoming the sixth tropical cyclone of the season. The depression gradually strengthened, becoming a tropical storm less than a day after tropical cyclogenesis. It was inferred to have reached hurricane intensity over the central Atlantic by September 15, though ship observations became increasingly sparse as the cyclone tracked farther away from land. The first definitive indication of a tropical cyclone at sea was a report from the Brazilian ship SS &quot;Alegrete&quot; which documented a barometric pressure of 958 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg) within hurricane-force winds on September 17. Based on this observation, the hurricane had maximum sustained winds of , making it the equivalent of a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale.

The hurricane continued to slowly strengthen and track westward at around about the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over the Bermuda. On September 18, a strong extratropical cyclone developed just west of Chicago, generating a strong influx of cooler air from Canada into the eastern United States and thus forming a sharp cold front over the region; this frontal boundary resulted in a channel of moist, tropical air being steered northwards into New England. At 18:00 UTC (2 p.m. EST) on September 19, the tropical cyclone strengthened further into a Category 5-equivalent hurricane with sustained winds of while north of the Turks and Caicos; this figure remained unchanged in reanalysis and serves as the storm&#x27;s peak strength, although the reanalysis project noted that &quot;considerable uncertainty&quot; remains regarding the magnitude of the storm&#x27;s maximum intensity at sea. Concurrently, the hurricane began to interact with the cold front over the East Coast, causing the tropical cyclone to curve northward towards the northeastern United States; the presence of the subtropical ridge to the east and the stationary nature of the frontal boundary prevented the storm from continuing to curve out to sea.

As the hurricane accelerated northward, it gradually weakened. On the morning of September 21, it passed roughly east of Cape Hatteras. At 12:00 UTC (8 a.m. EST) that day, the storm was estimated to have a barometric pressure of ; this is the hurricane&#x27;s lowest documented pressure. At 19:45 UTC (3:45 p.m. EST), the hurricane made landfall on Long Island over Bellport, New York with maximum sustained winds of and a pressure of , making it the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the New York City area. It was moving rapidly northward at , enhancing the intensity of the winds east of the center; in addition, its forward motion displaced its center of circulation away from the point of minimum barometric pressure. Weather Bureau forecaster Charles Pierce argued that the hurricane became extratropical off of the Outer Banks, though Charles J. Neumann, Frances P. Ho, and the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project suggested that it was tropical but in the process of extratropical transition at landfall. Afterwards, it quickly tracked across Long Island and Long Island Sound before making a second and final landfall near New Haven, Connecticut as a slightly weaker hurricane with winds of , making it one of only three recorded tropical cyclones to hit Connecticut as major hurricanes since 1900. The storm rapidly weakened, completing extratropical transition over Vermont by 00:00 UTC on September 22 (September 21, 8:00 p.m. EST). Following this transition, the remnants continued to weaken before they dissipated over southeastern Ontario on September 23.


==Forecasting the storm==
The 1938 hurricane surprised the United States Weather Bureau in that it did not take the typical track as it approached the area of the southeastern Bahamas. Normally, tropical cyclones approach the eastern Bahamas then slowly recurve north and northeast off the United States East Coast and move out to sea. The Jacksonville, Florida, office of the weather bureau issued a warning on September 19 that a hurricane might hit Florida. Residents and authorities made extensive preparations, as they had endured the Labor Day Hurricane three years earlier. When the storm turned north, the office issued warnings for the Carolina coast and transferred authority to the bureau&#x27;s headquarters in Washington. Both the Jacksonville and Washington, DC offices expected the cyclone to reach the ocean off North Carolina and then head harmlessly out to sea.

At 9:00 am EDT on September 21, the Washington office issued northeast storm warnings north of Atlantic City and south of Block Island, Rhode Island, and southeast storm warnings from Block Island to Eastport, Maine. The advisory, however, underestimated the storm&#x27;s intensity and said that it was farther south than it actually was. The office had yet to forward any information about the hurricane to the New York City office. At 10:00 am EDT, the bureau downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm. The 11:30 am advisory mentioned gale-force winds but nothing about a tropical storm or hurricane.

That day, 28 year-old rookie Charles Pierce was standing in for two veteran meteorologists. He concluded that the storm would be squeezed between a high-pressure area located to the west and a high-pressure area to the east, and that it would be forced to ride up a trough of low pressure into New England. A noon meeting was called and Pierce presented his conclusion, but he was overruled by &quot;celebrated&quot; chief forecaster Charles Mitchell and his senior staff. In Boston, meteorologist E.B. Rideout told his WEEI radio listeners – to the skepticism of his peers – that the hurricane would hit New England. At 2:00 pm, hurricane-force gusts were occurring on Long Island&#x27;s South Shore and near hurricane-force gusts on the coast of Connecticut. The Washington office issued an advisory saying that the storm was east-southeast of Atlantic City and would pass over Long Island and Connecticut. Re-analysis of the storm suggests that the hurricane was farther north and just from Fire Island, and that it was stronger and larger than the advisory stated.

==Impact==
The majority of the storm damage was from storm surge and wind. Damage was estimated at $308 million (equivalent to $ billion in ), making it among the most costly hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland. It is estimated that, if an identical hurricane had struck in 2005, it would have caused $39.2 billion in damage due to changes in population and infrastructure.

Approximately 600 people died in the storm on Long Island, New York, and in Connecticut and Rhode Island. An additional 708 people were reported injured.

In total, 4,500 cottages, farms, and other homes were reported destroyed and 25,000 homes were damaged. Other damages included 26,000 automobiles destroyed and 20,000 electrical poles toppled. The hurricane also devastated the forests of the Northeast, knocking down an estimated two billion trees in New York and New England.
Freshwater flooding was minimal, however, as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals, with only a few small areas receiving over .

Over 35% of New England&#x27;s total forest area was affected. In all, over 2.7 billion board feet of trees fell because of the storm, although 1.6 billion board feet of the trees were salvaged. The Northeastern Timber Salvage Administration (NETSA) was established to deal with the extreme fire hazard that the fallen timber had created. In many locations, roads from the fallen tree removal were visible decades later, and some became trails still used today. The New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad from New Haven to Providence was particularly hard hit, as countless bridges along the Shore Line were destroyed or flooded, severing rail connections to badly affected towns such as Westerly, Rhode Island. Due to the lack of technology in 1938, Long Island residents were not warned of the hurricane&#x27;s arrival, leaving no time to prepare or evacuate. &quot; The winds reached up to , with waves surging to around high.

Yale and Harvard both owned large forests managed by their forestry departments, but both forests were wiped out by the hurricane. However, Yale had a backup forest at Great Mountain in northwestern Connecticut which was spared from the totality of the damages, and they were able to keep their forestry program running, which maintains operation today. Harvard&#x27;s program, however, was reduced as a result.

===New Jersey===
The western side of the hurricane caused sustained tropical storm-force winds, high waves, and storm surge along the Jersey Shore and destroyed much of the boardwalk in Atlantic City. The Brigantine Bridge was destroyed over Absecon Inlet between Atlantic City and Brigantine, New Jersey. The surge inundated several coastal communities; Wildwood was under of water at the height of the storm, and the boardwalk was destroyed in Bay Head and dozens of cottages washed into the ocean. Crops sustained wind damage. The maximum recorded wind gust was at Sandy Hook.

===New York City and western Long Island===
The metropolitan area escaped the worst of the wind and storm surge because it was hit by the storm&#x27;s weaker western side. Winds were recorded at at Central Park, Battery Park recorded sustained winds of with gusts to , and a gust of was recorded above ground at the Daily News Building. Winds were estimated at on top of the Empire State Building. The highest winds were from the north to northwest on the back side of the storm. The storm surge was at the Battery and the Mean Low Water storm tide was at Willets Point. In New York Harbor, the waters rose in a half-hour.

In New York City and Long Island, schools were dismissed early. Extensive street flooding occurred because debris blocked drains. The East River flowed three blocks and flooded a Consolidated Edison (Con Ed) plant at 133rd Street, causing power to fail in Manhattan north of 59th Street and in the Bronx for several minutes to a few hours. Railroad and ferry services were suspended for a time. The Staten Island Ferry boat &quot;Knickerbocker&quot; got stuck in the terminal with 200 passengers aboard. Bridges and tunnels into Manhattan were closed until the following afternoon. 95% of Nassau County lost power, where floods brought traffic to a halt.

During the hurricane, starting before it hit and continuing after, a citywide trucker strike occurred across both NYC and New Jersey, this led to some complications to the relief effort. However, the unions made critical exceptions for relief supplies. Moving food supplies to relief depots, ballots for the New York primary before the hurricane hit while people were evacuating, and manning 1,000 relief sanitation trucks deployed by Mayor La Guardia with supplies after the hurricane had hit.

In Manhasset Bay, almost 400 boats were ripped from their moorings and smashed or sunk, with more than 100 washing up on the beach by the Port Washington Yacht Club. Similar scenes occurred in other locations on the north shore. The J. P. Morgan estate in Glen Cove was heavily damaged. The wife of New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia was forced to wait out the storm on the second floor of their Northport cottage. Mitchel Field army airfield was buffeted by winds of nearly and was under knee-deep water. In Williston Park, residents of 50 homes needed to be rescued by rowboat when heavy rain the previous few days combined with the rain from the hurricane to overflow a pond.

===Eastern Long Island===
The orientation of Eastern Long Island facing due south, made it extremely exposed to the storm surge and intense winds. The estimated peak storm tide in parts of eastern Long Island was .

A mean low water storm tide of was recorded at Port Jefferson. About 50 people perished in the storm&#x27;s wake. The Dune Road area of Westhampton Beach was obliterated, resulting in 29 deaths. There were 21 other deaths through the rest of the east end of Long Island. The storm surge temporarily turned Montauk into an island as it flooded across the South Fork at Napeague and obliterated the tracks of the Long Island Rail Road. Many other smaller roads were wiped away in the storm surge. So extensive was the storm surge and overwash on eastern Long Island, that rescue works had to use utility maps to figure out were roads and homes had been.

Ten new inlets were created on eastern Long Island. The surge rearranged the sand at the Cedar Point Lighthouse so that the island became connected to what is now Cedar Point County Park. The surging water created the Shinnecock Inlet by carving out a large section of barrier island separating Shinnecock Bay from the Atlantic. The storm toppled the landmark steeple of the Old Whaler&#x27;s Church, which was the tallest building in Sag Harbor. The steeple has not been rebuilt.

Wading River suffered substantial damage. The storm blew down the movie theater on Front Street in Greenport on the North Fork of Long Island. The fishing industry was destroyed, as was half of the apple crop.

===Rhode Island===

The storm surge was especially violent along the Rhode Island coastline, sweeping hundreds of summer cottages out to sea. As the surge drove northward through Narragansett Bay, it was restricted by the Bay&#x27;s funnel shape and rose to above normal spring tides, resulting in more than of water in some areas of downtown Providence. Several motorists were drowned in their automobiles. In Jamestown, seven children were killed when their school bus was blown into Mackerel Cove. Mobs looted stores in downtown Providence, often before the flood waters had fully subsided and due in part to the economic difficulties of the Great Depression. The tide was higher than usual because of the autumnal equinox and full moon, and the hurricane produced storm tides of 14 to along most of the Connecticut coast, with 18 to tides from New London, Connecticut east to Cape Cod—including the entire coastline of Rhode Island.

Many homes and structures were destroyed along the coast, as well as many structures inland along the hurricane&#x27;s path, and entire beach communities were obliterated on the coast. Napatree Point was completely swept away, a small cape that housed nearly 40 families between the Atlantic Ocean and Little Narragansett Bay just off of Watch Hill. Napatree is now a wildlife refuge with no human inhabitants. Concrete staircases and boardwalk bases destroyed by the hurricane can still be found when sand levels are low on some beaches. The boardwalk along Easton&#x27;s Beach in Newport was completely destroyed by the storm.

A few miles from Conanicut Island, Whale Rock Light was swept off its base and into the waves, killing lighthouse keeper Walter Eberle. His body was never found. The Prudence Island Light suffered a direct blow from the storm surge, which measured at Sandy Point. The masonry tower was slightly damaged, but the adjoining light keeper&#x27;s home was utterly destroyed and washed out to sea. The light keeper&#x27;s wife and son were both killed, as well as the former light keeper and a couple who left their summer cottages near the lighthouse and sought shelter in what they thought was the sturdier light keeper&#x27;s home. Light keeper George T. Gustavus was thrown free from the wreckage of the house and was saved by an island resident who held a branch into the water from the cliffs farther down the coast. Gustavus and Milton Chase, the owner of the island&#x27;s power plant, reactivated the light during the storm by running a cable from the plant to the light and installing a light bulb, marking the first time that it was illuminated with electricity.

The original parchment of the 1764 Charter of Brown University was washed clean of its text when its vault was flooded in a Providence bank. Newport recorded the highest water level of the storm at above mean sea level, according to a NOAA study. This storm level is above the SLOSH model of a 100-year storm, and one estimate is that this water level &quot;reflects a storm occurring roughly once every 400 years.&quot; A study of sand deposits also gives evidence that this was the strongest hurricane to hit Rhode Island in over 300 years. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier was completed in 1966 because of the massive flooding from the 1938 storm, and from the even higher storm surge that resulted from 1954&#x27;s Hurricane Carol, in hopes of preventing extreme storm surges from ever again flooding downtown Providence.

===Connecticut===

Eastern Connecticut was on the eastern side of the hurricane. Long Island acted as a buffer against large ocean surges, but the waters of Long Island Sound rose to great heights. Small shoreline towns to the east of New Haven experienced much destruction from the water and winds, and the 1938 hurricane holds the record for the worst natural disaster in Connecticut&#x27;s 350-year history. The mean low-water storm tide was at Stamford, at Bridgeport, and at New London, which remains a record high.

In the shoreline towns of Madison, Clinton, Westbrook, and Old Saybrook, buildings were found as wreckage across coastal roads. Actress Katharine Hepburn waded to safety from her Old Saybrook beach home, narrowly escaping death. She stated in her 1991 book that 95% of her personal belongings were either lost or destroyed, including her first Oscar for her appearance in &quot;Morning Glory&quot;, which was later found intact. In Old Lyme, beach cottages were flattened or swept away. The NYNH&amp;H passenger train &quot;Bostonian&quot; became stuck in debris at Stonington. Two passengers drowned while attempting to escape before the crew was able to clear the debris and get the train moving. Along the Stonington shorefront, buildings were swept off their foundations and found inland. Rescuers found live fish and crabs in kitchen drawers and cabinets while searching for survivors in the homes in Mystic.

New London was first swept by the winds and storm surge, after which the waterfront business district caught fire and burned out of control for 10 hours. Stately homes along Ocean Beach were leveled by the storm surge. The permanently anchored 240-ton lightship at the head of New London Harbor was found on a sand bar away. Interior sections of the state experienced widespread flooding as the hurricane&#x27;s torrential rains fell on soil already saturated from previous storms. The Connecticut River was forced out of its banks, inundating cities and towns from Hartford to Middletown.

Ultimately the storm became the deadliest and costliest storm in Connecticut history.

===Massachusetts===
The eye of the storm followed the Connecticut River north into Massachusetts, where the winds and flooding killed 99 people. In Springfield, the river rose six to above flood stage, causing significant damage. Up to of rain fell across western Massachusetts, which combined with over that had fallen a few days earlier to produce widespread flooding. Flash flooding on the Chicopee River washed away the Chicopee Falls Bridge, while the Connecticut River flooded most of the Willimansett section. Residents of Ware were stranded for days and relied on air-dropped food and medicine. After the flood receded, the town&#x27;s Main Street was a chasm in which sewer pipes could be seen.

To the east, the surge left Falmouth and New Bedford under eight feet of water. Two-thirds of the boats sank in New Bedford harbor. Several homes were washed away on Atlantic Boulevard in Fall River, and their foundations can still be found on the beach today. The Blue Hill Observatory registered sustained winds of and a peak gust of , which is the strongest hurricane-related surface wind gust ever recorded in the United States. A wave, the tallest of the storm, was recorded at Gloucester. A Boston Braves game against the Chicago Cubs was called during the storm.

The storm filled in a former waterway between Winthrop&#x27;s Point Shirley neighborhood and Boston&#x27;s Deer Island with sand and other natural earth minerals, creating an additional common border between Winthrop and Boston transforming Deer Island at the peninsula&#x27;s southern tip into an island by name only.

===Vermont===
The storm entered Vermont as a Category 1 hurricane at approximately 6:00 pm EDT, reaching northern Vermont, Burlington, and Lake Champlain around 8:00 pm. Hurricane-force winds caused extensive damage to trees, buildings, and power lines. Over of public roads were blocked, and it took months for crews to reopen some of the roads. In Montpelier, from the nearest coast, salt spray was seen on windows. A train was derailed in Castleton. The storm killed five people in Vermont. Sugar maple groves were damaged. It is the only system on record to have entered the state as a tropical cyclone.

===New Hampshire===

Even though the storm center tracked further west, through Vermont, New Hampshire received considerable damage. As in Vermont, very high winds brought down numerous trees and electric lines, but rainfall totals in New Hampshire were significantly less than those in other states. Only of rain fell in Concord. Damage at Peterborough was worse, however; total damage there was stated to be $500,000 (1938 dollars, $6.5 million in 2005), which included the destruction of 10 bridges. Much of the lower downtown burned because floodwaters prevented firefighters from reaching and extinguishing the blaze. Other communities also suffered considerable damage to forest resources. In New Hampshire, 13 people perished. At Mt. Washington, winds gusted to and knocked down part of a trestle on the Cog Railway.

===Maine===
In Maine, buildings and trees were damaged and power outages occurred. Storm surge was minimal, and winds remained below hurricane strength. The storm did not claim any lives in Maine.

===Maryland and Delaware===
The western periphery of the hurricane brought heavy rain and gusty winds to Delaware and southeastern Maryland. Damage, if any, is believed to have been minimal.

===Quebec===
As the hurricane was transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it tracked into southern Quebec. By the time the system initially crossed into Canada, it continued to produce heavy rain and very strong winds, but interaction with land had caused the system to weaken significantly. Still, many trees were blown down. Otherwise, damage in this region was minimal.

<text>Charlestown (, meaning &quot;great cove&quot;) is a village and port on the south coast of Cornwall, England, in the civil parish of St Austell Bay. It is situated approximately southeast of St Austell town centre.

The port at Charlestown developed in the late 18th century from the fishing village of West Polmear. Whereas other areas of St Austell have seen much development during the 20th century, Charlestown has remained relatively unchanged.

== History ==
Charlestown grew out of the small fishing village of West Polmear (or West Porthmear), which consisted of a few cottages and three cellars, in which the catch of pilchards were processed. The population amounted to nine fishermen and their families in 1790. Before the harbour was built, trading vessels landed and loaded on the beach. Charles Rashleigh, who moved to Duporth Manor, just outside the village, used plans prepared by John Smeaton to begin the construction of a harbour and dock in 1791. After building the outer pier, he excavated a natural inlet to form the main dock and a shipyard at its inner end that was demolished when the dock was extended. The first dock gates were completed in 1799. To maintain water levels in the dock, a leat was constructed, which brought water from the Luxulyan Valley, some away.

Rashleigh also planned the village, which had a broad road running from the harbour to Mount Charles. In 1793, a gun battery was built to the west of the harbour mouth, as a defence against possible French attacks. Volunteers from Rashleigh&#x27;s estate formed an artillery company that lasted until 1860, when the original four 18-pound cannons were replaced by 24-pound models. The Crinnis Cliff Volunteers became part of the 1st Cornwall (Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s) Artillery Volunteers, and the battery continued to be used for practice until 1898. In 1799 the locals asked his permission to rename the place Charles&#x27;s Town which became Charlestown.

The port was built to facilitate the transport of copper from nearby mines. Crinnis Hill Mine to the east of the village exported some 40,000 tons of copper ore between 1810 and 1813. South Polmear Mine to the west and Charlestown United Mines operated from a site near Holmbush to the north. This enterprise was particularly prolific, employing 431 men, 120 women and 263 children in 1838. The 1851 census recorded 283 adults living in Holmbush, of whom ten were employed as miners and one was the mine agent. As the mines became exhausted and their output dropped, the port was used to export china clay from the region&#x27;s quarries.

Following the death of Charles Rashleigh in 1823 the fate of Charlestown was caught up in the financial problems of his estate. Joseph Dingle, once a servant and footman employed by Rashleigh, became superintendent of works when the construction of the harbour began, but had systematically embezzled money from the project. By the time the case reached the courts in 1811, he was thought to have embezzled around £32,000 (equivalent to £ million in ) Dingle was bankrupted and died a pauper; Rashleigh also was made bankrupt before his death. 

In 1825 Messrs Crowder and Sartoris, trading as Charlestown Estate, agreed to accept all the leasehold property in Charlestown in lieu of sums owed to them and purchased the rest of the estate from the Rashleigh family becoming the new owners of the port and the surrounding settlement. Despite competition from the port at Pentewan, which opened in 1826, and from Par, which opened shortly afterwards, Charlestown prospered from the rapid expansion in the export of china clay until the onset of the First World War. By 1911, its population had increased to 3,184.

The harbour was designed for small sailing vessels, and an awkward turn was required to avoid the protruding end of the outer harbour. Following the widening of the entrance and the fitting of new gates in 1971, ships of up to 600 tons were able to enter the harbour, but could only do so at high tide, and a system of ropes was used to manoeuvre vessels through the gates. By the 1990s, the size of vessels used for the transport of china clay had outgrown the harbour, and the last commercial load of clay to leave Charlestown did so in 2000. Exports of china clay left Cornwall through Par or the deepwater port at Fowey instead. 

In 1994 the harbour was bought by Square Sail as a base for their sailing ships. Much of Square Sail&#x27;s business involves using the harbour and their ships as film sets such as the 2015 &quot;Poldark&quot; television series.

== Economy ==
Charlestown harbour is used by local fishermen but is owned by Square Sail, a company that owns and sails a small fleet of tall ships (including the &quot;Kaskelot&quot;) so one or two tall ships can often be found in the harbour. A well-known tall ship which used to regularly visit the port was the &quot;Maria Asumpta&quot;. First launched in 1858, it was the world&#x27;s oldest working square rigger but ran aground and broke up on the north Cornish coast in May 1995 with the loss of three of her sixteen crew. In July 2012 the owner of Square Sail and the harbour offered his business for sale for £4.4 million, made up of £1.5 million for the harbour, £1.4 million for Square Sail&#x27;s assets, and another £1.5 million for adjacent land.

Charlestown is a tourist destination whose attractions include the architecture and sea. The Charlestown Shipwreck, Rescue and Heritage Centre has also been put up for sale due to the retirement of the owner. The &quot;Pier House Hotel&quot; is by the harbour; the &quot;Rashleigh Arms&quot; public house is owned by St Austell Brewery. The post office closed without a replacement and the village has a gift shop and several other eating establishments in and around the harbour. As with many smaller villages in Cornwall most of its income is generated during the busy summer months and it becomes much quieter out of season, although many of its small businesses such as cafes, restaurants and public houses open all the year round.

==Religion==

The Methodist Chapel was built in 1827. It continued in use until 2000, when it closed and was sold. In 2012, the structure was in a poor state of repair and causing concern because it is within a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Both the chapel and the attached schoolrooms are Grade II* listed.

The parish of Charlestown was created in 1846 by the Diocese of Exeter, when the population of the village was about 3,000 people. It was split from the parish of St Austell, and land was given for a church in 1848 by George Augustus Crowder, the managing director of Charlestown Estates. Construction of St Paul&#x27;s Church began the following year and was completed in 1851. It was designed by Christopher Eales, and has a nave and chancel with transepts and north and south aisles. 

It is constructed of rubble with granite dressings. The tower at the western end did not have a spire until 1971, when a glass-reinforced plastic structure was added. The south aisle has late-19th-century stained-glass memorials to five local families. The church has been Grade II listed since 1999. St. Paul&#x27;s (see gallery of images) is an Anglo-Catholic church in the Oxford Movement style of worship in the Church of England.

== Culture ==
Charlestown harbour has been used as a filming location for both film and television dramas. On 25 September 2008 Tim Burton filmed part of his &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; film here. Filming took place on 1 February 2011 for much of &quot;The Curse of the Black Spot&quot;, an episode of the Doctor Who television series. It was filmed at night on the sailing ship &quot;Phoenix of Dell Quay&quot; while it was moored in the harbour.

In spring 2012, the harbour was a filming location for the fantasy adventure movie &quot;The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box&quot;. It was also used extensively in the war drama &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot;.

The harbour has also been used in the filming of recent series of &quot;Poldark&quot;.

In 2018 Mark Jenkin based much of the shooting for his film &quot;Bait&quot; there.

==Sport==
===Cornish wrestling===
Cornish wrestling tournaments were held in Charlestown throughout the 1800s and 1900s.

===Rowing===
Charlestown Rowing Club is based in the village.

== Education ==
Charlestown Primary School is a two form entry primary school situated between Charlestown village and Carlyon Bay.

== Administration ==
Charlestown is in the parliamentary constituency of St Austell and Newquay. Local government services are provided by Cornwall Council (a unitary authority), and since 1 April 2009 the village has been in St Austell Bay civil parish, before then it was in an unparished area of Restormel Borough Council.

<text>The 8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41 is a German 88mm anti-aircraft and anti-tank artillery gun, developed in the 1930s. It was widely used by Germany throughout World War II and is one of the most recognized German weapons of the conflict. The gun was universally known as the &quot;Acht-acht&quot; (&quot;eight-eight&quot;) by the Germans and the &quot;eighty-eight&quot; by the Allies. Due to its lethality, especially as a tank killer, the eighty-eight was greatly feared by Allied soldiers.

Development of the original model led to a wide variety of guns. The name of the gun applies to a series of related guns, the first one officially called the 8.8 cm Flak 18, the improved 8.8 cm Flak 36, and later the 8.8cm Flak 37. Flak is a contraction of German &quot;Flugabwehrkanone&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Fliegerabwehrkanone&quot;) meaning &quot;aircraft-defense cannon&quot;, the original purpose of the weapon. In English, &quot;flak&quot; became a generic term for ground anti-aircraft fire. Air defense units were usually deployed with either a Kommandogerät (&quot;command device&quot;) fire control computer or a portable Würzburg radar, which were responsible for its high level of accuracy against aircraft.

The versatile carriage allowed the 8.8 cm Flak to be fired in a limited anti-tank mode when still on its wheels; it could be completely emplaced in only two and a half minutes. Its successful use as an improvised anti-tank gun led to the development of a tank gun based upon it: the 8.8 cm KwK 36, with the &quot;KwK&quot; abbreviation standing for &quot;Kampfwagen-Kanone&quot; (literally &quot;battle vehicle cannon&quot;, or &quot;fighting vehicle cannon&quot;), meant to be placed in a gun turret as the tank&#x27;s primary armament. This gun served as the main armament of the Tiger I heavy tank.

In addition to these Krupp designs, Rheinmetall later created a more powerful anti-aircraft gun, the 8.8 cm Flak 41, which was produced in relatively small numbers. Krupp responded with another prototype of the long-barreled 8.8 cm gun, which was further developed into the anti-tank and tank destroyer 8.8 cm PaK 43 gun used for the Elefant and Jagdpanther, and turret-mounted 8.8 cm KwK 43 heavy tank gun of the Tiger II.

== Development history ==
=== Background ===
Initially, anti-aircraft artillery guns of World War I were adaptations of existing medium-caliber weapons, mounted to allow fire at higher angles. By 1915, the German command realized that these were useless for anything beyond deterrence, even against the vulnerable balloons and slow-moving aircraft of the period. With the increase of aircraft performance, many armies developed dedicated AA guns with a high muzzle velocity – allowing the projectiles to reach greater altitudes. It was this muzzle velocity, combined with a projectile of high weight, that made the 8.8 cm Flak one of the great World War II anti-tank guns. The first such German gun was introduced in 1917, using the 8.8 cm caliber common in the &quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot; (navy).

After losing the war, Germany had been forbidden under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles from procuring new weapons of most types. Nevertheless, the Krupp company started the development of a new gun together with Bofors of Sweden. Krupp had the majority ownership in Bofors since 1921. The original design was a 75 mm model. During the prototype phase, the army asked for a gun with considerably greater capability. The designers started again, using 88 mm caliber.

Prototype 88s were first produced in 1928. This early model, the Flak 18, used a single-piece barrel with a length of 56 calibers, leading to the commonly seen designation L/56.

=== First generation: Flak 18, 36 and 37 ===
The Flak 18 was mounted on a cruciform gun carriage. A simple-to-operate &quot;semi-automatic&quot; loading system ejected fired shells, allowing it to be reloaded by simply inserting a new shell into a tray. The gun would then fire and recoil; during the return stroke, the empty case would be thrown backward by levers, after which a cam would engage and recock the gun. This resulted in firing rates of 15 to 20 rounds a minute, which was better than similar weapons of the era. High explosive ammunition was used against aircraft and personnel, and armour-piercing and high-explosive anti-tank against tanks and other armored vehicles.

Widespread production started with the Nazi rise to power in 1933, and the Flak 18 was available in small numbers when Germany intervened in the Spanish Civil War. It quickly proved to be the best anti-aircraft weapon then available. The flak detachment with 88s proved accurate and versatile in combat against mainly land targets, the high muzzle velocity and large caliber making it an excellent long-range anti-vehicle and anti-bunker weapon. This experience also demonstrated a number of minor problems and potential improvement opportunities.

The Flak 18&#x27;s carriage allowed it to fire in an emergency when still on its wheels and without its outriggers, but with a very limited traverse and elevation. For normal emplacement, one single-axle bogie was detached from the front outrigger and one from the rear, side outriggers were then hinged from the vertical position to the ground; the total time to set up was estimated at two and a half minutes. Both modes of operation made the gun much more suitable for fast-moving operations, the basic concept of the &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;. The weight of the gun meant that only large vehicles could move it, the Sd.Kfz. 7 half-track becoming a common prime mover.

Targeting indicators were attached to the central controller to each of the four guns of a battery, allowing for coordinated fire. Indeed, with the automatic loading system, the gun layers&#x27; job was to keep the gun barrel trained on the target area based on the signals from the controller. The loaders would keep the weapon fed with live ammunition which would fire immediately upon insertion – all while the gun layer aimed the weapon according to the data.

Many of these improvements were incorporated into the Flak 36, which had a two-piece barrel for easier replacement of worn liners. Flak 36s were often fitted with an armoured shield that provided limited protection for the gunners. These shields could be retro-fitted on older Flak 18s as well.

The later model was the Flak 37, which included updated instrumentation to allow the gun layers to follow directions from the single director more easily. In some sources it is mistakenly stated that the Flak 37 was not equipped for anti-armor operation. In fact all 8.8 cm Flak guns were capable of operation in the dual role.

The parts of the various versions of the guns were interchangeable, and it was not uncommon for various parts to be &quot;mixed and matched&quot; on a particular example.

Both Flak 18 and Flak 36 had the same permanently attached fuze setter with two &quot;Zünderstellbecher&quot;. The Flak 37/41 had the simplified fuze setter of the 8.8-cm Flak 41.

=== Second generation: Flak 41 ===
As early as 1939 the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; asked for newer weapons with even better performance, to address the problems of defending against attack by high-flying aircraft. Rheinmetall responded with a new 88 mm design with a longer cartridge and a longer barrel.

A prototype was ready in early 1941 leading to the designation 8.8 cm Flak 41. The new gun fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of 1,000 m/s (3,280 ft/s), giving it an effective ceiling of and a maximum of , which General der Flakartillerie Otto Wilhelm von Renz said to be &quot;almost equal to the 128-mm.&quot; It featured a lower silhouette on its turntable mounting than did the 8.8-cm Flak 18/36/37 on its pedestal mounting. The barrel was at first a three-section one with a length of 74 calibers, and then redesigned to dual-section with a length of 72 calibers. Improvements in reloading raised the firing rate, with 20 to 25 rounds a minute being quoted.

Because of problems in service, the guns were almost exclusively used in Germany where they could be properly maintained and serviced. The Flak 41 had the disadvantage of complexity, and was prone to problems with ammunition, empty cases often jamming on extraction. Because of the high cost and complexity of this weapon, the Germans manufactured relatively few of them, 556 in all. The first deliveries were made in March 1943 and, as of August 1944, only 157 were fielded; with 318 in January 1945.

Given very low production numbers and ongoing problems with the Flak 41, attempts were made to install the Flak 41 barrel onto other guns&#x27; chassis. During 1942 tests were made using the Flak 41 barrel and Flak 37 chassis but these identified that the chassis could not take the strain even when strengthened. Work then continued using a Flak 37 barrel re-chambered for the Flak 41 round and with a muzzle brake. After other parts were strengthened this functioned as desired. The resulting piece was 74 calibers long (78 with the muzzle brake). Problems with the multi-part barrel construction of the Flak 37 were encountered and a new barrel based on the monoblock construction of the Flak 18 was designed. Production was cancelled after approximately only 13 units were built as the resources required to build these were similar to those needed to produce a true Flak 41 and those were simply no longer available at the time.

A further attempt was made to use a Flak 41 barrel on an existing mount from the 10.5 cm FlaK 39. The resulting unit outperformed the 105 mm original and was called the 8.8 cm Flak 39/41. However, production did not take place as no Flak 41 barrels were available. 
== Production history ==
Thousands of 88 mm guns were produced throughout the war in various models and mounts.

Compared to other artillery types, German industry built for example, 570 heavy (caliber 88–128 mm) flak guns, 1,020 field artillery pieces (caliber 75–210 mm), and 1,300 tank guns, anti-tank guns, plus self-propelled guns in December 1943.

== Combat history ==
=== German use ===
The 88 mm was used in two main roles: as a mobile heavy anti-aircraft and as an anti-tank gun. Other uses included firing in support of the troops at the front and as a more static anti-aircraft gun for home defence.

After 1935, the anti-aircraft defense of Germany was controlled by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. By the beginning of World War II the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s anti-aircraft artillery employed 6,700 light (2 cm and 3.7 cm) and 2,628 heavy flak guns. Of the latter, a small number were 10.5 cm Flak 38s or 39s, the majority were 8.8 cm Flak 18s, 36s or 37s. This was twice as many heavy AA guns as RAF Fighter Command had at the time, with France and the United States having even fewer.

Throughout the entire war, the majority of 88 mm guns were used in their original anti-aircraft role.

The guns were usually equipped with a &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; system, which was an analog gunnery computer. The &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; systems were introduced starting in 1925, and the &quot;Kommandogerät&quot; p40 was the standard system during the majority of the war. It allowed extremely precise fire, and would even take into account how far away the guns were from one another and the aiming crew, cancelling out the offset and aiming all weapons at the same point. This allowed multiple guns to be aimed precisely at the same target by a single command crew of five men, instead of requiring trained crews on each gun.

Radar aiming systems were also developed to complement these systems. The Würzburg radar series of radars was produced in the thousands and used widely. It allowed general area fire without line of sight, but had poor accuracy compared to the visual systems. This resulted in the Giant Würzburg, which had sufficient accuracy to precisely control guns without direct visual contact.

The financial costs associated with anti-aircraft cannon were substantial, especially when compared with fighter aircraft. For example, in January 1943 – at a time when Germany was desperately fighting to regain the strategic initiative in the East and was also facing a heavy bombing campaign in the West – expenditures on anti-aircraft defenses were , whereas all the remaining weapons and munitions production amounted to (including of the navy budget and only nine million of the aircraft-related budget).

By August 1944, there were 10,704 Flak 18, 36 and 37 guns in service, now complemented also by the 10.5 cm Flak 38 and 39, and the formidable 12.8 cm Flak 40, owing to the increase in US and British bombing raids during 1943 and 1944.

==== Support of ground troops ====

The 8.8 cm Flak performed well in its original role of an anti-aircraft gun and it proved to be a superb anti-tank gun as well. An American tanker who survived losing three tanks wrote to Chrysler after V-E Day that &quot;an 88 sure makes quick work of them. They go through them just like they were a piece of paper&quot;. Its success was due to its versatility: the standard anti-aircraft platform allowed gunners to depress the muzzle below the horizontal, unlike most of its contemporaries. As the war progressed, it was becoming increasingly clear that existing anti-tank weapons were unable to pierce the armor of heavier enemy tanks and ground commanders began increasingly to use the 8.8 cm Flak against tanks.

Similarly to the anti-aircraft role, as an anti-tank weapon the 8.8 cm Flak was tactically arranged into batteries, usually four guns to each. The higher-level tactical unit was usually a mixed anti-aircraft battalion (&quot;gemischte Flak-Abteilung&quot;). It totaled 12 such guns on average, supplemented by light guns.

The German Condor Legion made extensive use of the 8.8 cm Flak 18 in the Spanish Civil War, where its usefulness as an anti-tank weapon and general artillery piece exceeded its role as an anti-aircraft gun. For the Battle of France in 1940, the army was supported by eighty-eights deployed in twenty-four mixed flak battalions. The 8.8 cm Flak was used against heavily armored tanks such as the Char B1 &quot;bis&quot; and Matilda II, whose frontal armour could not be penetrated by the standard light 3.7 cm anti-tank gun. The 8.8 cm Flak was powerful enough to penetrate over 84 mm of armor at a range of 2 km, making it an unparalleled anti-tank weapon during the early days of the war and still formidable against all but the heaviest tanks at the end. Erwin Rommel&#x27;s use of the gun to blunt the British counterattack at Arras ended any hope of a breakout from the encirclement of May 1940. In the entire Battle of France, the weapon destroyed 152 tanks and 151 bunkers. The Battle of France also saw the introduction of vehicle-mounted 8.8 cm Flak 18s, the so-called &quot;Bunkerknacker&quot; on the Sd.Kfz. 8 heavy tractor.
During the North African campaign, Rommel made the most effective use of the weapon, as he lured tanks of the British Eighth Army into traps by baiting them with apparently retreating German panzers. A mere two flak battalions destroyed 264 British tanks in 1941. Repeated high tank loss from well-placed 8.8 cm Flak guns in the battles of Halfaya Pass earned it the nickname &quot;Hellfire Pass&quot;. Later in that theater, in the Battle of Faid in Tunisia, Rommel camouflaged many 8.8 cm Flaks (with additional 7.5 cm Pak 40s and 5 cm Pak 38s) in vegetation-filled areas. Inexperienced U.S. tankers and commanders rushed into a valley at Faid only to be obliterated. When the U.S. Army&#x27;s M4 Sherman tanks pursued, concealed German guns picked them off at ranges far beyond those of their 75 mm guns.

For Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, Germany deployed the 8.8 cm Flak in 51 mixed AA battalions. They were mostly &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;-subordinated units attached to the &quot;Heer&quot; at corps or army level, with approximately one battalion per corps. The weapon saw continuous use on the eastern front. The appearance of the outstanding T-34 and the later KV tanks shocked the German panzer crews and anti-tank teams, who could only penetrate the Soviet tanks&#x27; armor at extremely close range on the order of 200 yards when using the standard 37 mm and 50 mm guns, while the Russian 76 mm gun was effective out to 1000 yards.

The 8.8 cm Flak in the anti-tank role was arguably most effective in the flat and open terrain of Libya, Egypt and the eastern front. The less open terrain in Italy and Northern France was less suitable for long-range AT guns. The success of the German anti-tank weapons caused the Allies to take steps to defend against it in new tank designs. On July 18 and 19 1944 a Luftwaffe 8.8 cm anti-aircraft battery was re-purposed by then Major Hans von Luck to attack British tanks near Cagny taking part in Operation Goodwood. Twenty tanks were destroyed by these guns within the first few seconds and at least 40 tanks were knocked out by 8.8 cm Flaks during the engagement. Just as important, the success of the 8.8 cm Flaks spawned the development of dedicated 8.8 cm caliber PAKs (see below) which were even more adept at anti-tank mission due to their lower silhouette design. By February 1945, there were 327 heavy anti-aircraft batteries facing the Red Army, which was 21 percent of those used for anti-aircraft defense.

==== Coastal defence ====
On 14 September 1942, Flak-Abt. I./43 (Major Wegener) employed these guns against a commando landing raid called Operation Agreement by the British Royal Navy near Tobruk. Between them, Italian 155 mm (6-inch) shore batteries and aerial attack, the destroyer was so severely damaged that she sank while being towed by .

=== Use by other armed forces ===
==== Italy ====
In June 1939 Italy had credits of about Lit.300 million with Germany for the sale of processed materials, therefore the &quot;Ministro della Guerra&quot; (Ministry of War) proposed that these credits be paid with the sale of 50 batteries of 8.8 Flak (88/55 in the Italian nomenclature), equal to 300 guns with relative ammunition. While the proposal was accepted in principle, the German authorities stated that they did not have that quantity of pieces available, so they paid off the debt in part with 8.8 cm Flak and partly with the 7.5 cm &quot;kanon&quot; (75/50 in the Italian name). In the proposal presented by the German authorities, the Italian supply of mechanical parts for anti-aircraft guns and anti-tank guns was also envisaged, so the production of components for artillery was started in the workshops Ansaldo in (Genoa and Pozzuoli) and OTO. The batteries were supplied complete with a Zeiss firing station Mod. 36 and related auxiliary equipment.

The batteries began arriving in Italy a few days after Italy entered the war, and were initially assigned in part to the &quot;Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale&quot; (Voluntary Militia for National Security, MACA), for the protection of the Italian main cities and partly sent in Libya, for the protection of ports. Some groups were subsequently assigned to mobile motorcycle sections. However it was immediately evident that the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Italian Royal Army) did not have at its disposal a tractor with characteristics suitable for towing this piece, given that the task was entrusted to Lancia 3Ro, without all-wheel drive. At the end of 1940, 44 pieces and relative firing stations were available. Starting from October 1942, several batteries, while remaining in German possession, were used by Italian personnel (officers and troops) for the protection of military infrastructures and cities, this practice was further intensified in 1943, reaching more than 100 batteries. In addition to the cannons that arrived for the canals established in 1940, in 1943, 24 pieces and their tractors were transferred to Italy intended for equipping the &quot;1ª Divisione corazzata &quot;M&quot;&quot; (1st Armored Division &quot;M&quot;). The 88/55 in the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; was used in its natural role, that is, as an anti-aircraft weapon, its use as an anti-tank cannon was limited to the theaters of Northern Africa (Libya and Tunisia) and only for a few &quot;gruppi autocampali&quot; (self-transported field artillery groups).

==== China ====
In 1937, the Chinese Nationalist Government imported 20 Flak 18 guns and used them to defend the fortifications along the Yangtze River. The Flak 18s were extensively deployed during the all-aerial combat of the Battle of Chongqing and Chengdu.

==== Finland ====
In 1943–1944 Finland bought 90 8.8 cm FlaK 37 cannons from Germany and they were used for air defence of largest cities in Finland. These cannons played an important role against Soviet air raids in Helsinki in February 1944. After the war these cannons remained in Finnish use as AA-guns until 1977 and after that as coastal guns until the early 2000s. The gun had nickname &quot;Rämäpää&quot; (&quot;Reckless&quot;) after the manufacturer&#x27;s initials RMB. Several of the Finnish guns survive in museums and as memorials.

==== Spain ====
Four batteries (16 guns) of 88 mm guns (Flak 18) initially reached Spain as AA with the Condor Legion in 1936, but it was soon used as anti-tank, anti-bunker and even for counterbattery fire. More guns were sent later, and some 88 mm guns were also supplied to Spanish army units. At the end of the war the Spanish Army was using all of the Flak 18 guns sent, some 52 units.

Initially, the Flak 18 batteries were deployed to protect the airfields and logistics bases of the German Condor legion. The scarcity of artillery among the Nationalist forces and the general low proficiency of the Spanish gun crews forced the usage of the Flak 18 gun in a variety of roles, including as an artillery piece and as an anti-tank gun. Given appropriate ammunition it proved quite capable in both roles. The war in Spain, with its wildly fluctuating front lines and the presence of Russian tanks, forced the Germans to employ the Flak 18 guns in a direct fire mode against ground targets. By the end of the war the 88 mm guns had performed far more missions as an anti-tank and direct-fire Field Artillery gun than as an anti-aircraft gun. During the war German 88 mm guns were involved in 377 combat engagements, only 31 were against enemy aircraft. The use of the 88 mm in direct support of the infantry brought the gun crews in close proximity to the enemy and made the crews susceptible to infantry fire. Casualties among the legion&#x27;s 88 mm gun batteries in the Spanish Civil War were second only to those among the bomber pilots.

In early 1937 in the fighting around Malaga, a battery of 88 mm guns was assigned to support an infantry brigade. Bad weather grounded the main bomber force, but the assault succeeded, mainly because of the concentrated and accurate fire of the supporting 88 mm guns. Flak 18 batteries were used by the nationalist army at the Battle of Ebro, both for direct fire against pillboxes and also for indirect fire in the advance towards Barcelona.

Following the Spanish Civil War, more Flak 36 models arrived in 1943 (88 guns 88/56 mm Flak-36) and since 1943 they were manufactured under license in Trubia under the denomination FT 44 (about 200 guns).

==== Allied ====
The Flak 36 guns were briefly issued in late 1944 to the American Seventh Army as captured weapons. The 79th Field Artillery Battalion (Provisional) was formed from personnel of the 79th and 179th Field Artillery Groups to fire captured German artillery pieces at the height of an ammunition shortage. Similarly, the 244th Field Artillery Battalion was temporarily equipped with a miscellany of captured German 88 mm guns and 105 mm and 150 mm howitzers. By December 31, 1944, the 244th Field Artillery Battalion had fired a total of 10,706 rounds through captured German weapons.

==== France ====
In March 1945, France equipped its 401st, 403rd and 407 Anti-Aircraft artillery regiment with captured German 8.8 guns, associated with British GL Mk. II and GL Mk. III radars. The guns remained in service with second-line units until 1953 and then were used for training for a few years.

==== Yugoslavia ====
During the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, various Flak guns were used, mainly by the naval artillery of the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA). The Yugoslav Army (VJ) also used Flak carriages mounted with double 262 mm rocket launch tubes from the M-87 Orkan MLRS, instead of the 88 mm gun. It was capable of deploying cluster bombs, as well as anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, at up to 50 km. Only a few were built in mid-1993, the entire project was generally regarded as unsuccessful.

==== Greece ====
Greece had at least 24 guns (8.8) that were used against the Regia Aeronautica during the Italian invasion of Greece in 1940. Later these guns were used against the invading German forces in April 1941.

==== Vietnam ====
Beginning in 1954 the Democratic Republic of Vietnam received a number of Flak 88s from the Soviet Union. These cannons were used against US fighter jets in the early 60s.

== Comparison with similar anti-aircraft guns ==
The Flak 18/36/37 was roughly comparable to its Italian and Allied counterparts. As an anti-aircraft gun it fired a 9.2 kilogram (20 lb) shell at a muzzle velocity of 840 m/s to an effective ceiling of 8,000 meters, with a maximum ceiling of 9900 meters. While this was potent against US daylight raids, which generally flew at altitudes of , some aircraft were able to fly higher than the gun&#x27;s effective ceiling. Some flak batteries used guns worn out from firing beyond their operational lives, which typically limited their effective ceiling to .

In comparison, the British QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) Mark III fired a projectile at 790 m/s (2,600 ft/s) to an effective ceiling of , the American 90 mm M1 fired a shell at 820 m/s (2,700 ft/s) to the same height, the Soviet 85 mm air defense gun M1939 (52-K) fired a projectile at 792 m/s (2,598 ft/s) to an effective ceiling of 10,500 metres (34, 448 ft) and the Italian Cannone da 90/53 fired a 10.33 kg projectile at 830 m/s to an effective ceiling of . The Allied weapons&#x27; capabilities were augmented by the introduction of proximity fuzes. The Allies&#x27; and Italian weapons were heavier and less mobile, with the Allied weapons being almost useless for ground fire until numerous modifications were carried out.

While the US and Italian 90 mm were also used as anti-tank guns – the American gun being in use on their M36 tank destroyer and M26 Pershing heavy tank, the 85mm Soviet gun being fitted to the SU-85, later models of the T-34 and the stopgap KV-85 and IS-1 heavy tanks – their use was considerably more limited than the German 88 due to German tanks being primarily used defensively by 1944 and the Allies operating dedicated AT guns (both as mobile AT guns and tank cannons); such as the Ordnance QF 17-pounder in British service and the 76 mm gun M1 in American service.

== Related developments ==
=== 8.8 cm KwK 36 ===
The KwK 36 (abbreviation of &quot; 36&quot;) was a tank gun developed and built by Krupp in parallel to the Flak 36, with which it shared ammunition and ballistics. It was the main armament of the Tiger I heavy tank.

=== 8.8 cm PaK 43 and KwK 43 ===

At the time that Rheinmetall developed the Flak 41, Krupp tried to compete with their 8.8 cm Gerät 42 proposal, which was not accepted for production as an anti-aircraft gun. Krupp continued development, resulting in the dreaded 8.8 cm PaK 43 anti-tank gun and the related 8.8 cm KwK 43 tank gun.

The PaK 43 (an abbreviation of &quot;Panzerjägerkanone 43&quot;) used a new cruciform mount with the gun much closer to the ground, making it far easier to hide and harder to hit. It was also provided with a much stronger and more angled armour shield to provide better protection to the crew. In addition to the towed version, there were also self-propelled versions of the PaK 43 gun, including the lightly armored &quot;Nashorn&quot;, and the strongly armored, fully casemate-enclosed &quot;Elefant&quot; and &quot;Jagdpanther&quot; tank destroyers.

All versions were able to penetrate about 200 mm (7.9 inches) of armour at 1,000 m (3280 feet), allowing it to defeat the armor of any contemporary tank.

The main armament of the Tiger II heavy tank, the KwK 43 tank gun, was the PaK 43 adapted for tank use, and it was considered for the Panther II tank.

== Versions ==
=== Guns using the 88×571R mm cartridge ===

* 8.8 cm Flak 18 Had a new semi-automatic breech, making it a rapid fire gun. It entered production in Germany in 1933 and used the &quot;Sonderanhänger&quot; 201 trailer. its weight was seven tonnes. Its rate of fire was 15 to 20 rounds per minute. It was later fitted with a gun shield to protect the crew when engaging ground targets. It was produced by Krupp.
** Mod 1938 II: Approximately 50 guns were modified so a single man could adjust the elevation and traverse.
* 8.8 cm Flak 36 Entered service 1936–37. It used the redesigned trailer &quot;Sonderanhänger&quot; 202 which enabled a faster time into action from the move. The &quot;SdAnh&quot; 202 had twin wheels on two similar carriages. It could engage ground targets from the traveling position. Its weight was seven tonnes. Its rate of fire was 15 to 20 rounds per minute. It was produced by Krupp. It was subsequently fitted with a shield to protect the crew when engaging ground targets.
* 8.8 cm KwK 36: The main gun of the Tiger I (PzKw VI &quot;Ausf&quot;. E) tank. Despite its lineage, some classify it as a parallel development with very similar specifications rather than a derivative of the Flak 36.
* 8.8 cm Flak 37: It was an updated version of the Flak 36, the main difference being &quot;Übertragungser&quot; 37 (a data transmission system). It was produced by Krupp.

=== Guns using the 88×855R mm cartridge ===
* 8.8 cm Flak 41: This was a weapon developed and produced by Rheinmetall-Borsig to be used with an 855 mm cartridge case. It was fitted to the existing &quot;Sonderanhänger&quot; 202 as standard and entered service in 1943. The barrel was at first designed as three-section with a length of 74 calibers, and then redesigned to dual-section with a length of 72 calibers.
* 8.8 cm Flak 37/41: This weapon was an attempt to allow the Flak 18/36/37 family to fire the more powerful round of the Flak 41. Only 13 built.

<text>Hlotse (also Leribe) is an important market town in Lesotho. It is situated on the Hlotse River, near the South African border. The town was founded in 1876 by a British missionary, Reverend John Widdicombe. It was a colonial centre until Lesotho gained its independence. The population in 2016 was 38,558.

The alternate name, Leribe, comes from the adjacent French Protestant Leribe Mission, founded in 1859 by François Coillard. Hlotse is also called Leribe because it is the camptown in the district of Leribe.

The main Basotho Headquarters for Help Lesotho is in Hlotse.

==Places of interest==
Three different sightseeing locations are the Leribe Craft Centre, statue in front of the District Administration office, and an old military lookout.

The Leribe Craft Centre sells handmade wool items ranging from scarfs to jackets. The craft centre is located on the side of the road as a person comes into Hlotse. The statue in front of the District Administration building dates back to English rule of Lesotho. It is located in the central part of the city. The old military lookout also dates back to English rule and is located in the central part of the city.

<text>In computing, fixed-point is a method of representing fractional (non-integer) numbers by storing a fixed number of digits of their fractional part. Dollar amounts, for example, are often stored with exactly two fractional digits, representing the cents (1/100 of dollar). More generally, the term may refer to representing fractional values as integer multiples of some fixed small unit, e.g. a fractional amount of hours as an integer multiple of ten-minute intervals. Fixed-point number representation is often contrasted to the more complicated and computationally demanding floating-point representation.

In the fixed-point representation, the fraction is often expressed in the same number base as the integer part, but using negative powers of the base &quot;b&quot;. The most common variants are decimal (base 10) and binary (base 2). The latter is commonly known also as binary scaling. Thus, if &quot;n&quot; fraction digits are stored, the value will always be an integer multiple of &quot;b&quot;−&quot;n&quot;. Fixed-point representation can also be used to omit the low-order digits of integer values, e.g. when representing large dollar values as multiples of $1000.

When decimal fixed-point numbers are displayed for human reading, the fraction digits are usually separated from those of the integer part by a radix character (usually &#x27;.&#x27; in English, but &#x27;,&#x27; or some other symbol in many other languages). Internally, however, there is no separation, and the distinction between the two groups of digits is defined only by the programs that handle such numbers.

Fixed-point representation was the norm in mechanical calculators. Since most modern processors have fast floating-point unit (FPU), fixed-point representations in processor-based implementations are now used only in special situations, such as in low-cost embedded microprocessors and microcontrollers; in applications that demand high speed or low power consumption or small chip area, like image, video, and digital signal processing; or when their use is more natural for the problem. Examples of the latter are accounting of dollar amounts, when fractions of cents must be rounded to whole cents in strictly prescribed ways; and the evaluation of functions by table lookup, or any application where rational numbers need to be represented without rounding errors (which fixed-point does but floating-point cannot). Fixed-point representation is still the norm for field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations, as floating-point support in an FPGA requires significantly more resources than fixed-point support. 

==Representation==

A fixed-point representation of a fractional number is essentially an integer that is to be implicitly multiplied by a fixed scaling factor. For example, the value 1.23 can be stored in a variable as the integer value 1230 with implicit scaling factor of 1/1000 (meaning that the last 3 decimal digits are implicitly assumed to be a decimal fraction), and the value can be represented as 1230 with an implicit scaling factor of 1000 (with &quot;minus 3&quot; implied decimal fraction digits, that is, with 3 implicit zero digits at right). This representation allows standard integer arithmetic logic units to perform rational number calculations.

Negative values are usually represented in binary fixed-point format as a signed integer in two&#x27;s complement representation with an implicit scaling factor as above. The sign of the value will always be indicated by the first stored bit (1 = negative, 0 = non-negative), even if the number of fraction bits is greater than or equal to the total number of bits. For example, the 8-bit signed binary integer (11110101)2 = −11, taken with -3, +5, and +12 implied fraction bits, would represent the values −11/2−3 = −88, −11/25 = −0., and −11/212 = −0., respectively.

Alternatively, negative values can be represented by an integer in the sign-magnitude format, in which case the sign is never included in the number of implied fraction bits. This variant is more commonly used in decimal fixed-point arithmetic. Thus the signed 5-digit decimal integer (−00025)10, taken with -3, +5, and +12 implied decimal fraction digits, would represent the values −25/10−3 = −25000, −25/105 = −0.00025, and −25/1012 = −0., respectively.

A program will usually assume that all fixed-point values that will be stored into a given variable, or will be produced by a given instruction, will have the same scaling factor. This parameter can usually be chosen by the programmer depending on the precision needed and range of values to be stored.

The scaling factor of a variable or formula may not appear explicitly in the program. Good programming practice then requires that it be provided in the documentation, at least as a comment in the source code.

===Choice of scaling factors===

For greater efficiency, scaling factors are often chosen to be powers (positive or negative) of the base &quot;b&quot; used to represent the integers internally. However, often the best scaling factor is dictated by the application. Thus one often uses scaling factors that are powers of 10 (e.g. 1/100 for dollar values), for human convenience, even when the integers are represented internally in binary. Decimal scaling factors also mesh well with the metric (SI) system, since the choice of the fixed-point scaling factor is often equivalent to the choice of a unit of measure (like centimeters or microns instead of meters).

However, other scaling factors may be used occasionally, e.g. a fractional amount of hours may be represented as an integer number of seconds; that is, as a fixed-point number with scale factor of 1/3600.

Even with the most careful rounding, fixed-point values represented with a scaling factor &quot;S&quot; may have an error of up to ±0.5 in the stored integer, that is, ±0.5 &quot;S&quot; in the value. Therefore, smaller scaling factors generally produce more accurate results.

On the other hand, a smaller scaling factor means a smaller range of the values that can be stored in a given program variable. The maximum fixed-point value that can be stored into a variable is the largest integer value that can be stored into it, multiplied by the scaling factor; and similarly for the minimum value. For example, the table below gives the implied scaling factor &quot;S&quot;, the minimum and maximum representable values &quot;V&quot;min and &quot;V&quot;max, and the accuracy &quot;δ&quot; = &quot;S&quot;/2 of values that could be represented in 16-bit signed binary fixed point format, depending on the number &quot;f&quot; of implied fraction bits.
Fixed-point formats with scaling factors of the form 2&quot;n&quot;-1 (namely 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, etc.) have been said to be appropriate for image processing and other digital signal processing tasks. They are supposed to provide more consistent conversions between fixed- and floating-point values than the usual 2&quot;n&quot; scaling. The Julia programming language implements both versions.

===Exact values===

Any binary fraction &quot;a&quot;/2&quot;m&quot;, such as 1/16 or 17/32, can be exactly represented in fixed-point, with a power-of-two scaling factor 1/2&quot;n&quot; with any &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;m&quot;. However, most decimal fractions like 0.1 or 0.123 are infinite repeating fractions in base 2. and hence cannot be represented that way.

Similarly, any decimal fraction &quot;a&quot;/10&quot;m&quot;, such as 1/100 or 37/1000, can be exactly represented in fixed point with a power-of-ten scaling factor 1/10&quot;n&quot; with any &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;m&quot;. This decimal format can also represent any binary fraction &quot;a&quot;/2&quot;m&quot;, such as 1/8 (0.125) or 17/32 (0.53125).

More generally, a rational number &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot;, with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; relatively prime and &quot;b&quot; positive, can be exactly represented in binary fixed point only if &quot;b&quot; is a power of 2; and in decimal fixed point only if &quot;b&quot; has no prime factors other than 2 and/or 5.

===Comparison with floating-point===

Fixed-point computations can be faster and/or use less hardware than floating-point ones. If the range of the values to be represented is known in advance and is sufficiently limited, fixed point can make better use of the available bits. For example, if 32 bits are available to represent a number between 0 and 1, a fixed-point representation can have error less than 1.2 × 10−10, whereas the standard floating-point representation may have error up to 596 × 10−10 — because 9 of the bits are wasted with the sign and exponent of the dynamic scaling factor. Specifically, comparing 32-bit fixed-point to floating-point audio, a recording requiring less than 40 dB of headroom has a higher signal-to-noise ratio using 32-bit fixed.

Programs using fixed-point computations are usually more portable than those using floating-point since they do not depend on the availability of an FPU. This advantage was particularly strong before the IEEE Floating Point Standard was widely adopted when floating-point computations with the same data would yield different results depending on the manufacturer, and often on the computer model.

Many embedded processors lack an FPU, because integer arithmetic units require substantially fewer logic gates and consume much smaller chip area than an FPU; and software emulation of floating-point on low-speed devices would be too slow for most applications. CPU chips for the earlier personal computers and game consoles, like the Intel 386 and 486SX, also lacked an FPU.

The &quot;absolute&quot; resolution (difference between successive values) of any fixed-point format is constant over the whole range, namely the scaling factor &quot;S&quot;. In contrast, the &quot;relative&quot; resolution of a floating-point format is approximately constant over their whole range, varying within a factor of the base &quot;b&quot;; whereas their &quot;absolute&quot; resolution varies by many orders of magnitude, like the values themselves.

In many cases, the rounding and truncation errors of fixed-point computations are easier to analyze than those of the equivalent floating-point computations. Applying linearization techniques to truncation, such as dithering and/or noise shaping is more straightforward within fixed-point arithmetic. On the other hand, the use of fixed point requires greater care by the programmer. Avoidance of overflow requires much tighter estimates for the ranges of variables and all intermediate values in the computation, and often also extra code to adjust their scaling factors. Fixed-point programming normally requires the use of integer types of different widths. Fixed-point applications can make use of block floating point, which is a fixed-point environment having each array (block) of fixed-point data be scaled with a common exponent in a single word.

==Applications==
A common use of decimal fixed-point is for storing monetary values, for which the complicated rounding rules of floating-point numbers are often a liability. For example, the open-source money management application GnuCash, written in C, switched from floating-point to fixed-point as of version 1.6, for this reason.

Binary fixed-point (binary scaling) was widely used from the late 1960s to the 1980s for real-time computing that was mathematically intensive, such as flight simulation and in nuclear power plant control algorithms. It is still used in many DSP applications and custom-made microprocessors. Computations involving angles would use binary angular measurement.

Binary fixed point is used in the STM32G4 series CORDIC co-processors and in the discrete cosine transform algorithms used to compress JPEG images.

Electronic instruments such as electricity meters and digital clocks often use polynomials to compensate for introduced errors, e.g. from temperature or power supply voltage. The coefficients are produced by polynomial regression. Binary fixed-point polynomials can utilize more bits of precision than floating-point and do so in fast code using inexpensive CPUs. Accuracy, crucial for instruments, compares well to equivalent-bit floating-point calculations, if the fixed-point polynomials are evaluated using Horner&#x27;s method (e.g. ) to reduce the number of times that rounding occurs, and the fixed-point multiplications utilize rounding addends.

==Operations==

===Addition and subtraction===
To add or subtract two values with the same implicit scaling factor, it is sufficient to add or subtract the underlying integers; the result will have their common implicit scaling factor and can thus be stored in the same program variables as the operands. These operations yield the exact mathematical result, as long as no overflow occurs—that is, as long as the resulting integer can be stored in the receiving program variable. If the operands have different scaling factors, then they must be converted to a common scaling factor before the operation.

===Multiplication===
To multiply two fixed-point numbers, it suffices to multiply the two underlying integers, and assume that the scaling factor of the result is the product of their scaling factors. The result will be exact, with no rounding, provided that it does not overflow the receiving variable.

For example, multiplying the numbers 123 scaled by 1/1000 (0.123) and 25 scaled by 1/10 (2.5) yields the integer 123×25 = 3075 scaled by (1/1000)×(1/10) = 1/10000, that is 3075/10000 = 0.3075. As another example, multiplying the first number by 155 implicitly scaled by 1/32 (155/32 = 4.84375) yields the integer 123×155 = 19065 with implicit scaling factor (1/1000)×(1/32) = 1/32000, that is 19065/32000 = 0.59578125.

In binary, it is common to use a scaling factor that is a power of two. After the multiplication, the scaling factor can be divided away by shifting right. Shifting is simple and fast in most computers. Rounding is possible by adding a &#x27;rounding addend&#x27; of half of the scaling factor before shifting; The proof: round(x/y) = floor(x/y + 0.5) = floor((x + y/2)/y) = shift-of-n(x + 2^(n-1)) A similar method is usable in any scaling.

===Division===
To divide two fixed-point numbers, one takes the integer quotient of their underlying integers and assumes that the scaling factor is the quotient of their scaling factors. In general, the first division requires rounding and therefore the result is not exact.

For example, division of 3456 scaled by 1/100 (34.56) and 1234 scaled by 1/1000 (1.234) yields the integer 3456÷1234 = 3 (rounded) with scale factor (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, that is, 30. As another example, the division of the first number by 155 implicitly scaled by 1/32 (155/32 = 4.84375) yields the integer 3456÷155 = 22 (rounded) with implicit scaling factor (1/100)/(1/32) = 32/100 = 8/25, that is 22×32/100 = 7.04.

If the result is not exact, the error introduced by the rounding can be reduced or even eliminated by converting the dividend to a smaller scaling factor. For example, if &quot;r&quot; = 1.23 is represented as 123 with scaling 1/100, and &quot;s&quot; = 6.25 is represented as 6250 with scaling 1/1000, then simple division of the integers yields 123÷6250 = 0 (rounded) with scaling factor (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10. If &quot;r&quot; is first converted to 1,230,000 with scaling factor 1/1000000, the result will be 1,230,000÷6250 = 197 (rounded) with scale factor 1/1000 (0.197). The exact value 1.23/6.25 is 0.1968.

===Scaling conversion===
In fixed-point computing it is often necessary to convert a value to a different scaling factor. This operation is necessary, for example:

* To store a value into a program variable that has a different implicit scaling factor;
* To convert two values to the same scaling factor, so that they can be added or subtracted;
* To restore the original scaling factor of a value after multiplying or dividing it by another;
* To improve the accuracy of the result of a division;
* To ensure that the scaling factor of a product or quotient is a simple power like 10&quot;n&quot; or 2&quot;n&quot;;
* To ensure that the result of an operation can be stored into a program variable without overflow;
* To reduce the cost of hardware that processes fixed-point data.

To convert a number from a fixed point type with scaling factor &quot;R&quot; to another type with scaling factor &quot;S&quot;, the underlying integer must be multiplied by the ratio &quot;R&quot;/&quot;S&quot;. Thus, for example, to convert the value 1.23 = 123/100 from scaling factor &quot;R&quot;=1/100 to one with scaling factor &quot;S&quot;=1/1000, the integer 123 must be multiplied by (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, yielding the representation 1230/1000.

If the scaling factor is a power of the base used internally to represent the integer, changing the scaling factor requires only dropping low-order digits of the integer, or appending zero digits. However, this operation must preserve the sign of the number. In two&#x27;s complement representation, that means extending the sign bit as in arithmetic shift operations.

If &quot;S&quot; does not divide &quot;R&quot; (in particular, if the new scaling factor &quot;S&quot; is greater than the original &quot;R&quot;), the new integer may have to be rounded.

In particular, if &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are fixed-point variables with implicit scaling factors &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot;, the operation &quot;r&quot; ← &quot;r&quot;×&quot;s&quot; requires multiplying the respective integers and explicitly dividing the result by &quot;S&quot;. The result may have to be rounded, and overflow may occur.

For example, if the common scaling factor is 1/100, multiplying 1.23 by 0.25 entails multiplying 123 by 25 to yield 3075 with an intermediate scaling factor of 1/10000. In order to return to the original scaling factor 1/100, the integer 3075 then must be multiplied by 1/100, that is, divided by 100, to yield either 31 (0.31) or 30 (0.30), depending on the rounding policy used.

Similarly, the operation &quot;r&quot; ← &quot;r&quot;/&quot;s&quot; will require dividing the integers and explicitly multiplying the quotient by &quot;S&quot;. Rounding and/or overflow may occur here too.

===Conversion to and from floating-point===
To convert a number from floating point to fixed point, one may multiply it by the scaling factor &quot;S&quot;, then round the result to the nearest integer. Care must be taken to ensure that the result fits in the destination variable or register. Depending on the scaling factor and storage size, and on the range input numbers, the conversion may not entail any rounding.

To convert a fixed-point number to floating-point, one may convert the integer to floating-point and then divide it by the scaling factor &quot;S&quot;. This conversion may entail rounding if the integer&#x27;s absolute value is greater than 224 (for binary single-precision IEEE floating point) or of 253 (for double-precision). Overflow or underflow may occur if |&quot;S&quot;| is &quot;very&quot; large or &quot;very&quot; small, respectively.

==Hardware support==

===Scaling and renormalization===
Typical processors do not have specific support for fixed-point arithmetic. However, most computers with binary arithmetic have fast bit shift instructions that can multiply or divide an integer by any power of 2; in particular, an arithmetic shift instruction. These instructions can be used to quickly change scaling factors that are powers of 2, while preserving the sign of the number.

Early computers like the IBM 1620 and the Burroughs B3500 used a binary-coded decimal (BCD) representation for integers, namely base 10 where each decimal digit was independently encoded with 4 bits. Some processors, such as microcontrollers, may still use it. In such machines, conversion of decimal scaling factors can be performed by bit shifts and/or by memory address manipulation.

Some DSP architectures offer native support for specific fixed-point formats, for example, signed &quot;n&quot;-bit numbers with &quot;n&quot;−1 fraction bits (whose values may range between −1 and almost +1). The support may include a multiply instruction that includes renormalization—the scaling conversion of the product from 2&quot;n&quot;−2 to &quot;n&quot;−1 fraction bits. If the CPU does not provide that feature, the programmer must save the product in a large enough register or temporary variable, and code the renormalization explicitly.

===Overflow===
Overflow happens when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be stored in the designated destination area. In addition and subtraction, the result may require one bit more than the operands. In multiplication of two unsigned integers with &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; bits, the result may have &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot; bits.

In case of overflow, the high-order bits are usually lost, as the un-scaled integer gets reduced modulo 2&quot;n&quot; where &quot;n&quot; is the size of the storage area. The sign bit, in particular, is lost, which may radically change the sign and the magnitude of the value.

Some processors can set a hardware overflow flag and/or generate an exception on the occurrence of an overflow. Some processors may instead provide saturation arithmetic: if the result of an addition or subtraction were to overflow, they store instead the value with the largest magnitude that can fit in the receiving area and has the correct sign. 

However, these features are not very useful in practice; it is generally easier and safer to select scaling factors and word sizes so as to exclude the possibility of overflow, or to check the operands for excessive values before executing the operation.

==Computer language support==
Explicit support for fixed-point numbers is provided by a few programming languages, notably PL/I, COBOL, Ada, JOVIAL, and Coral 66. They provide fixed-point data types, with a binary or decimal scaling factor. The compiler automatically generates code to do the appropriate scaling conversions when doing operations on these data types, when reading or writing variables, or when converting the values to other data types such as floating-point.

Most of those languages were designed between 1955 and 1990. More modern languages usually do not offer any fixed-point data types or support for scaling factor conversion. That is also the case for several older languages that are still very popular, like FORTRAN, C and C++. The wide availability of fast floating-point processors, with strictly standardized behavior, has greatly reduced the demand for binary fixed-point support. Similarly, the support for decimal floating point in some programming languages, like C# and Python, has removed most of the need for decimal fixed-point support. In the few situations that call for fixed-point operations, they can be implemented by the programmer, with explicit scaling conversion, in any programming language.

On the other hand, all relational databases and the SQL notation support fixed-point decimal arithmetic and storage of numbers. PostgreSQL has a special &lt;samp&gt;numeric&lt;/samp&gt; type for exact storage of numbers with up to 1000 digits.

Moreover, in 2008 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) issued a proposal to extend the C programming language with fixed-point data types, for the benefit of programs running on embedded processors. Also, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) has back-end support for fixed-point.

==Detailed examples==
===Decimal fixed point multiplication===
Suppose there is the following multiplication with 2 fixed point 3 decimal place numbers.
:formula_1
Note how since there are 3 decimal places we show the trailing zeros. To re-characterize this as an integer multiplication we must first multiply by formula_2 moving all the decimal places in to integer places, then we will multiply by formula_3 to put them back the equation now looks like
:formula_4

This works equivalently if we choose a different base, notably base 2 for computing since a bit shift is the same as a multiplication or division by an order of 2. Three decimal digits is equivalent to about 10 binary digits, so we should round 0.05 to 10 bits after the binary point. The closest approximation is then 0.0000110011.
:formula_5
Thus our multiplication becomes
:formula_6

This rounds to 11.023 with three digits after the decimal point.

===Binary fixed-point multiplication===
Consider the task of computing the product of 1.2 and 5.6 with binary fixed point using 16 fraction bits. To represent the two numbers, one multiplies them by 216, obtaining .2 and .6; and round these values the nearest integers, obtaining and . These numbers will fit comfortably into a 32-bit word with two&#x27;s complement signed format.

Multiplying these integers together gives the 35-bit integer with 32 fraction bits, without any rounding. Note that storing this value directly into a 32-bit integer variable would result in overflow and loss of the most significant bits. In practice, it would probably be stored in a signed 64-bit integer variable or register.

If the result is to be stored in the same format as the data, with 16 fraction bits, that integer should be divided by 216, which gives approximately .28, and then rounded to the nearest integer. This effect can be achieved by adding 215 and then shifting the result by 16 bits. The result is , which represents the value 6.. Taking into account the precision of the format, that value is better expressed as 6. ± 0. (not counting the error that comes from the operand approximations). The correct result would be 1.2 × 5.6 = 6.72.

For a more complicated example, suppose that the two numbers 1.2 and 5.6 are represented in 32-bit fixed point format with 30 and 20 fraction bits, respectively. Scaling by 230 and 220 gives .8 and .6, that round to and , respectively. Both numbers still fit in a 32-bit signed integer variable, and represent the fractions
: 1. and
: 5.
Their product is (exactly) the 53-bit integer , which has 30+20 = 50 implied fraction bits and therefore represents the fraction 
: 6.
If we choose to represent this value in signed 16-bit fixed format with 8 fraction bits, we must divide the integer product by 250-8 = 242 and round the result; which can be achieved by adding 241 and shifting by 42 bits. The result is 1720, representing the value 1720/28 = 6., or approximately 6.719 ± 0.002.

==Notations==
Various notations have been used to concisely specify the parameters of a fixed-point format. In the following list, &quot;f&quot; represents the number of fractional bits, &quot;m&quot; the number of magnitude or integer bits, &quot;s&quot; the number of sign bits, and &quot;b&quot; the total number of bits.

* The COBOL programming language originally supported decimal fixed-precision with arbitrary size and decimal scaling, whose format was specified &quot;graphically&quot; with the directive. For example, specified a sign-magnitude 6-digit decimal integer with two decimal fraction digits.
* The construct &quot;p&quot;&quot;f&quot; is used in the PL/I programming language, to specify a fixed-point signed binary data type with &quot;p&quot; total bits (not including sign) with &quot;f&quot; bits in the fraction part; that is a &quot;p&quot;+1 bit signed integer with a scaling factor of 1/2&quot;f&quot;. The latter could be positive or negative. One could specify instead of , and instead of for base 10.
* In the Ada programming language, a numeric data type can be specified by, for example, meaning a fixed-point representation consisting of a signed binary integer in two&#x27;s complement format with 7 implied fraction bits (providing a scaling factor 1/128) and at least 15 bits total (ensuring an actual range from -128.00 to almost +128.00).
* The Q notation was defined by Texas Instruments. One writes &quot;f&quot; to specify a signed binary fixed-point value with &quot;f&quot; fraction bits; for example, specifies a signed integer in two&#x27;s complement notation with a scaling factor 1/215. The code &quot;m&quot;&quot;f&quot; specifies additionally that the number has &quot;m&quot; bits in the integer part of the value, not counting the sign bit. Thus would describe a binary fixed-point format with 1 integer bit and 30 fractional bits, which could be stored as a 32-bit 2&#x27;s complement integer with scaling factor 1/230. A similar notation has been used by ARM, except that they count the sign bit in the value of &quot;m&quot;; so the same format above would be specified as .
* The notation &quot;m&quot; has been used to mean a fixed binary format with &quot;m&quot; bits in the integer part; the rest of the word being fraction bits. For example, the maximum and minimum values that can be stored in a signed number are ≈32767.9999847 and −32768.0, respectively.
* The VisSim company used &quot;m&quot;&quot;b&quot; to denote a binary fixed-point value with &quot;b&quot; total bits and &quot;m&quot; bits in the integer part; that is, a &quot;b&quot;-bit integer with scaling factor 1/2&quot;b&quot;−&quot;m&quot;. Thus would mean a 16-bit number with 1 bit in the integer part and 15 in the fraction.
* The PS2 GS (&quot;Graphics Synthesizer&quot;) User&#x27;s Guide uses the notation &quot;s&#x27;m&#x27;f&quot;, where &quot;s&quot; specifies the presence (0 or 1) of sign bit. For example, represents an unsigned 8-bit integer with a scaling factor of 1/23.
* The LabVIEW programming language uses the notation &quot;s&#x27;b&#x27;m&quot; to specify the parameters of an &#x27;FXP&#x27; fixed point numbers. The &quot;s&quot; component can be either &#x27;+&#x27; or &#x27;±&#x27;, signifying either an unsigned or 2&#x27;s complement signed number, respectively. The &quot;b&quot; component is the total number of bits, and &quot;m&quot; is the number of bits in the integer part.

==Software application examples==
* The popular TrueType font format uses 32-bit signed binary fixed-point with 26 bits to the left of the decimal for some numeric values in its instructions. This format was chosen to provide the minimal amount of precision required for hinting and for performance reasons.
* With the exception of the Nintendo 64, all 3D games for the fifth generation of video game consoles, including the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, PlayStation, Saturn, and Jaguar use fixed-point arithmetic, as the systems lack hardware floating-point units. The PlayStation transformation coprocessor supports 16-bit fixed point with 12 fraction bits - whereas the Sega Saturn VDP coprocessors used a 32-bit fixed point format reserving the lower 16 bits for the fractional part.
* The TeX typesetting software, widely used by scientists and mathematicians, uses 32-bit signed binary fixed point with 16 fraction bits for all position calculations. The values are interpreted as fractions of a typographer&#x27;s point. TeX font metric files use 32-bit signed fixed-point numbers, with 12 fraction bits.
* Tremor, Toast and MAD are software libraries which decode the Ogg Vorbis, GSM Full Rate and MP3 audio formats respectively. These codecs use fixed-point arithmetic because many audio decoding hardware devices do not have an FPU.
* The WavPack lossless audio compressor uses fixed point arithmetic. The choice was justified by, among other things, the worry that different floating-point rounding rules in different hardware could corrupt the lossless nature of the compression.
* The Nest Labs Utilities library, provides a limited set of macros and functions for fixed point numbers, particularly when dealing with those numbers in the context of sensor sampling and sensor outputs.
* The OpenGL ES 1.x specification includes a fixed point profile, as it is an API aimed for embedded systems, which do not always have an FPU.
* The dc and bc programs are arbitrary precision calculators, but only keep track of a (user-specified) fixed number of fractional digits.
* Fractint represents numbers as Q2.29 fixed-point numbers, to speed up drawing on old PCs with 386 or 486SX processors, which lacked an FPU.
* &quot;Doom&quot; was the last first-person shooter game by id Software to use a 16.16 fixed point representation for all of its non-integer computations, including map system, geometry, rendering, and player movement. This representation is still used in modern &quot;Doom&quot; source ports.
* The Q# programming language for the Azure quantum computers, that implement quantum logic gates, contains a standard numeric library for performing fixed-point arithmetic on registers of qubits.

<text>The Legends Cup, originally known as the Lingerie Bowl, was the championship game of the LFL—originally the Lingerie Football League and later the Legends Football League—which operated from 2009 to 2019. It was a game of full-contact American football with female athletes playing seven-on-seven tackle football. The players in the game wore helmets, shoulder pads, elbow pads, knee pads, bras and underwear. The LFL ceased operation following its 2019 season, then was restructured as the Extreme Football League (X League), which began play in 2022. The X League&#x27;s championship game is branded as the &quot;X Cup&quot;.

==History==
Originally played as an annual Super Bowl halftime alternative shown on pay-per-view TV, Lingerie Bowl I aired during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004 with Team Euphoria losing to the Team Dream by a score of 6–0. Two more games were subsequently played (Lingerie Bowl II in 2005 and Lingerie Bowl III in 2006) however the next three (Lingerie Bowl IV (2007), Lingerie Bowl V (2008) and Lingerie Bowl VI (2009)) were for various reasons cancelled. In 2010 Producer Horizon Productions expanded the concept into a ten team league called the Lingerie Football League (LFL), playing its first season from September 2009 to January 2010 on Friday nights in major arenas and stadiums. Lingerie Bowl VII (2010) served as the championship match for the season. Since then the Lingerie Bowl has been contested between the Eastern and Western Conference champions of the LFL. For the 2012 Lingerie Bowl, the game was moved to kickoff before the Super Bowl, rather than be played as an alternative halftime entertainment option. In 2012, the LFL underwent a re-branding, changing its name to the Legends Football League and the championship game to the Legends Cup.

For the first three games the halftime special included celebrities such as Jenny McCarthy, Dennis Rodman, Chingy, Eric Dickerson, Lawrence Taylor, Cindy Margolis, Traci Bingham, Michael Buffer and Jim McMahon. Previous Lingerie Bowls have taken place at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

==Lingerie Bowls==

===Lingerie Bowl (2004)===
The first Lingerie Bowl between two teams of models and actresses—Team Dream and Team Euphoria, captained by Nikki Ziering and Angie Everhart. Team Dream shut-out Euphoria with a single touchdown, winning the inaugural game 6–0.

===Lingerie Bowl II (2005)===
Los Angeles Temptation defeated New York Euphoria

===Lingerie Bowl III (2006)===
New York Euphoria 13-12 Los Angeles Temptation

===Lingerie Bowl IV (2007)===
Lingerie Bowl IV was to air opposite Super Bowl XLI&#x27;s halftime show, but the PPV broadcast was cancelled. Horizon had announced that the cancellation was due to having reached a deal with an unspecified cable network to broadcast the following year&#x27;s game.

===Lingerie Bowl V (2008)===
The game was announced to be held at a downtown golf course in Scottsdale, Arizona (a neighbor to Super Bowl XLII host city Glendale, Arizona) as the first Lingerie Bowl to be held outside of Los Angeles. Organizers had planned a three-day &quot;Experience Village&quot; in downtown Scottsdale, including activities, live music, autograph sessions, and a &quot;Football After Dark&quot; party on the eve of the game, but no formal applications had been approved as of February 2007. Residents of Scottsdale also displayed opposition towards the hosting of the event in the city. After withdrawing formal applications with the city in October 2007, Horizon continued to promote that the game would be held somewhere around Phoenix, but these plans never materialized. A Horizon spokesperson eventually reported that the game had been cancelled, as the time spent on attempting to obtain permits to organize the events in Scottsdale had &quot;[limited] our possibilities in neighboring cities.&quot; Additionally, Horizon did not elaborate on the previously announced broadcasting deal it had allegedly reached for Lingerie Bowl V.

===Lingerie Bowl VI (2009)===
Lingerie Bowl VI, between the Miami Caliente and the Tampa Breeze, was scheduled for January 31, 2009 to be played at Caliente Resorts, a nudist resort in Pasco County, Florida (near Super Bowl XLIII host city Tampa Bay). The game was cancelled due to conflicts between the organizers and the resort over clothing requirements; a spokesperson for the resort stated that the organizers were &quot;wanting more areas of our resort restricted to clothing required than we could accommodate.&quot;

===Lingerie Bowl VII (2010)===

Lingerie Bowl VII featured the winners of the LFL&#x27;s Western and Eastern Conference in a game played on February 6, 2010, at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida. The game was intended to be webcast opposite Super Bowl XLIV&#x27;s halftime show in Miami Gardens, Florida, on February 7, 2010. The Western Conference Los Angeles Temptation defeated the Eastern Conference Chicago Bliss by the score of 27–14. Server problems and &quot;overwhelming internet demand&quot; kept fans from streaming the Lingerie Bowl game video until more than an hour after the conclusion of the Super Bowl.

===Lingerie Bowl VIII (2011)===

Lingerie Bowl VIII featured the defending champion Los Angeles Temptation, winners of the Western Conference, against the Eastern Conference winning Philadelphia Passion. The Temptation defeated the Passion, 26–25, at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Approximately 3,000 fans attended the game. The game returned to traditional pay-per-view television instead of the failed Internet broadcast from the previous year.

===Lingerie Bowl IX (2012)===

The Orleans Arena was selected as the host venue for Lingerie Bowl IX played on February 5, 2012. The game moved to before the Super Bowl, instead of its usual halftime, to allow a full game to be played instead of the abbreviated games of previous years; the game also aired on MTV2 instead of on pay-per-view.

===Lingerie Bowl Canada I (2012)===

With the creation of LFL Canada the first Canadian Lingerie Bowl was played on November 17, 2012, between the Saskatoon Sirens and the BC Angels at the Abbotsford Entertainment &amp; Sports Centre in Abbotsford, British Columbia, one week before the CFL&#x27;s Grey Cup. The BC Angels won the inaugural championship game 25–12 with BC Angels&#x27; quarterback Mary Ann Hanson the game&#x27;s MVP.

===Legends Cup (2013)===

In 2012, the league decided to officially move the next LFL United States season to a spring league, beginning in April 2013. Along with the re-branding of the league, the now Legends Cup was to be played at Highmark Stadium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 1, 2013. However, due to ticket sales exceeding the 3,000 seat capacity of Highmark, an announcement was made on June 1, 2013, that the game would be moved to Philadelphia&#x27;s PPL Park, the 2013 home of the Philadelphia Passion. On July 5, 2013, LFL once again moved the game, this time back to the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, citing an agreement having been made to have the publicized game played there for the next 3 years.

===LFL Canada Legends Cup 2013===

The 2013 LFL Canada Legends Cup was scheduled to be played on Saturday, 16 November 2013 at Stampede Corral in Calgary, Alberta between the first and second placed teams of the 2013 LFL Canada season.

===LFL Australian Legends Cup 2013–14===

With the creation of LFL Australia the first 2013–14 LFL Australian Legends Cup was scheduled to be played on Saturday, 8 February 2014 at nib Stadium in Perth between the first and second placed teams of the 2013–14 LFL Australia season.

<doc id="449738" wikidata="Q217608" url="?curid=449738" title="Fixed point (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a fixed point (sometimes shortened to fixpoint), also known as an invariant point, is a value that does not change under a given transformation. Specifically, for functions, a fixed point is an element that is mapped to itself by the function. Any set of fixed points of a transformation is also an invariant set.

== Fixed point of a function ==

Formally, is a fixed point of a function if belongs to both the domain and the codomain of , and .
In particular, cannot have any fixed point if its domain is disjoint from its codomain.
If is defined on the real numbers, it corresponds, in graphical terms, to a curve in the Euclidean plane, and each fixed-point corresponds to an intersection of the curve with the line , cf. picture.

For example, if is defined on the real numbers by
formula_1
then 2 is a fixed point of , because .

Not all functions have fixed points: for example, has no fixed points because is never equal to for any real number.

== Fixed point iteration ==
In numerical analysis, &quot;fixed-point iteration&quot; is a method of computing fixed points of a function. Specifically, given a function formula_2 with the same domain and codomain, a point formula_3 in the domain of formula_2, the fixed-point iteration is

formula_5

which gives rise to the sequence formula_6 of iterated function applications formula_7 which is hoped to converge to a point formula_8. If formula_2 is continuous, then one can prove that the obtained formula_8 is a fixed point of formula_2.

The notions of attracting fixed points, repelling fixed points, and periodic points are defined with respect to fixed-point iteration.

==Fixed-point theorems==
A fixed-point theorem is a result saying that at least one fixed point exists, under some general condition.

For example, the Banach fixed-point theorem (1922) gives a general criterion guaranteeing that, if it is satisfied, fixed-point iteration will always converge to a fixed point.

The Brouwer fixed-point theorem (1911) says that any continuous function from the closed unit ball in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space to itself must have a fixed point, but it doesn&#x27;t describe how to find the fixed point.

The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem (and the Nielsen fixed-point theorem) from algebraic topology give a way to count fixed points.

== Fixed point of a group action ==

In algebra, for a group &quot;G&quot; acting on a set &quot;X&quot; with a group action formula_12, &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is said to be a fixed point of &quot;g&quot; if formula_13.

The fixed-point subgroup formula_14 of an automorphism &quot;f&quot; of a group &quot;G&quot; is the subgroup of &quot;G&quot;:
formula_15

Similarly, the fixed-point subring formula_16 of an automorphism &quot;f&quot; of a ring &quot;R&quot; is the subring of the fixed points of &quot;f&quot;, that is,
formula_17

In Galois theory, the set of the fixed points of a set of field automorphisms is a field called the fixed field of the set of automorphisms.

==Topological fixed point property==
A topological space formula_18 is said to have the fixed point property (FPP) if for any continuous function
:formula_19
there exists formula_20 such that formula_21.

The FPP is a topological invariant, i.e., it is preserved by any homeomorphism. The FPP is also preserved by any retraction.

According to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, every compact and convex subset of a Euclidean space has the FPP. Compactness alone does not imply the FPP, and convexity is not even a topological property, so it makes sense to ask how to topologically characterize the FPP. In 1932 Borsuk asked whether compactness together with contractibility could be a necessary and sufficient condition for the FPP to hold. The problem was open for 20 years until the conjecture was disproved by Kinoshita, who found an example of a compact contractible space without the FPP.

==Fixed points of partial orders ==

In domain theory, the notion and terminology of fixed points is generalized to a partial order. Let ≤ be a partial order over a set &quot;X&quot; and let &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; be a function over &quot;X&quot;. Then a prefixed point (also spelled pre-fixed point, sometimes shortened to prefixpoint or pre-fixpoint) of &quot;f&quot; is any &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) ≤ &quot;p&quot;. Analogously, a &quot;postfixed point&quot; of &quot;f&quot; is any &quot;p&quot; such that &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;). The opposite usage occasionally appears. Malkis justifies the definition presented here as follows: &quot;since &quot;f&quot; is the inequality sign in the term &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;x&quot;, such &quot;x&quot; is called a fix point.&quot; A fixed point is a point that is both a prefixpoint and a postfixpoint. Prefixpoints and postfixpoints have applications in theoretical computer science.

=== Least fixed point ===
In order theory, the least fixed point of a function from a partially ordered set (poset) to itself is the fixed point which is less than each other fixed point, according to the order of the poset. A function need not have a least fixed point, but if it does then the least fixed point is unique.

One way to express the Knaster–Tarski theorem is to say that a monotone function on a complete lattice has a least fixed point that coincides with its least prefixpoint (and similarly its greatest fixed point coincides with its greatest postfixpoint).

==Fixed-point combinator==
In combinatory logic for computer science, a fixed-point combinator is a higher-order function formula_22 that returns a fixed point of its argument function, if one exists. Formally, if the function &quot;f&quot; has one or more fixed points, then
: formula_23

==Fixed-point logics==
In mathematical logic, fixed-point logics are extensions of classical predicate logic that have been introduced to express recursion. Their development has been motivated by descriptive complexity theory and their relationship to database query languages, in particular to Datalog.

==Applications==

In many fields, equilibria or stability are fundamental concepts that can be described in terms of fixed points. Some examples follow.

* In projective geometry, a fixed point of a projectivity has been called a double point.
* In economics, a Nash equilibrium of a game is a fixed point of the game&#x27;s best response correspondence. John Nash exploited the Kakutani fixed-point theorem for his seminal paper that won him the Nobel prize in economics.
* In physics, more precisely in the theory of phase transitions, &quot;linearization&quot; near an &quot;unstable&quot; fixed point has led to Wilson&#x27;s Nobel prize-winning work inventing the renormalization group, and to the mathematical explanation of the term &quot;critical phenomenon.&quot;
* Programming language compilers use fixed point computations for program analysis, for example in data-flow analysis, which is often required for code optimization. They are also the core concept used by the generic program analysis method abstract interpretation.
* In type theory, the fixed-point combinator allows definition of recursive functions in the untyped lambda calculus.
* The vector of PageRank values of all web pages is the fixed point of a linear transformation derived from the World Wide Web&#x27;s link structure.
* The stationary distribution of a Markov chain is the fixed point of the one step transition probability function.
* Fixed points are used to finding formulas for iterated functions.

<text>A rush hour (American English, British English) or peak hour (Australian English, Indian English) is a part of the day during which traffic congestion on roads and crowding on public transport is at its highest. Normally, this happens twice every weekday: once in the morning and once in the afternoon or evening, the times during which most people commute. The term is often used for a period of peak congestion that may last for more than one hour.
The term is very broad, but often refers specifically to private automobile transportation traffic, even when there is a large volume of cars on a road but not many people, or if the volume is normal but there is some disruption of speed. By analogy to vehicular traffic, the term Internet rush hour has been used to describe periods of peak data network usage, resulting in delays and slower delivery of data packets.

==Definition==
The name is sometimes a misnomer, as the peak period often lasts more than one hour and the &quot;rush&quot; refers to the volume of traffic, not the speed of its flow. Peak traffic periods may vary from country to country, city to city, from region to region, and seasonally.

The frequency of public transport service is usually higher in the rush hour, and longer trains or larger vehicles are often used. However, the increase in capacity is often less than the increased number of passengers, due to the limits on available vehicles, staff and, in the case of rail transport, track capacity including platform length. The resulting crowding may force many passengers to stand, and others may be unable to board. If there is inadequate capacity, this can make public transport less attractive, leading to higher car use and partly shifting the congestion to roads.

Transport demand management, such as road pricing or a congestion charge, is designed to induce people to alter their travel timing to minimize congestion. Similarly, public transport fares may be higher during peak periods; this is often presented as an off peak discount for single fares. Season tickets or multi-ride tickets, sold at a discount, are commonly used in rush hours by commuters, and may or may not reflect rush hour fare differentials.

Staggered hours have been promoted as a means of spreading demand across a longer time span—for example, in &quot;Rush Hour&quot; (1941 film) and by the International Labour Office.

==Traffic management by country==

===Australia and New Zealand===

In the morning, and evening, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, and Auckland and Christchurch are usually the most congested cities in Australia and New Zealand respectively. In Melbourne the Monash Freeway, which connects Melbourne&#x27;s suburban sprawl to the city, is usually heavily congested each morning and evening. In Perth, Mitchell Freeway, Kwinana Freeway and various arterial roads are usually congested between peak hours, making movement between suburbs and the city quite slow.

Efforts to minimise traffic congestion during peak hour vary on a state by state and city by city basis.

In Melbourne, congestion is managed by means including:
* Inbound transit lanes on busy freeways which are limited to motorcycles and other vehicles with more than one occupant during busy periods.
* Free travel on metropolitan trains before 7am. Passengers must exit the system at their destination station before 7am.
* Dedicated bus lanes on major inner city roads such as Hoddle Street.
* Introduction of dedicated bicycle lanes (often by removing vehicle lanes) in the inner city area to encourage cyclists and deter dual-track vehicles.
* Prohibition of parking along busy roads during peak traffic periods to create an extra lane for traffic.

In Brisbane, congestion is managed by means including:
* Fares for using public transport outside of peak periods (referred to as off-peak) are cheaper than peak period fares. 
* Transport for Brisbane operated bus lines for Translink, Bus upgrade zone) designated lines increase their frequency from every 15 minutes to every 10 minutes between 7am and 9am, and between 4:30pm and 6:30pm.
* Busways in Brisbane grade separate a significant amount of bus traffic, particularly on the South and Eastern suburbs using the South East Busway, the Eastern Busway (connects with the South East Busway at Buranda), with some relief on the northern suburbs provided by the Northern Busway. This reduces the traffic load shared by buses and other vehicles, therefore allowing for more capacity for other vehicles on major trunk roads in and out of Brisbane.
* Some specific peak-hour only bus services are denoted by a &quot;P&quot; prefix where only fares are accepted by tapping on with a go card, with no cash-paid ticket sales. These services may also be noted as having the suffix 
&quot;(Rocket)&quot; in timetables, where many inner city suburb stops may be bypassed. 
* On some Queensland Rail operated lines for Translink, increase frequency from every 30 minutes to as frequent as every 6 minutes, between 6:45am and 7:45am and from 4:45pm to 5:45pm during peak times. Most notable on the Caboolture, Ipswich &amp; Rosewood, Redcliffe Peninsula and Springfield lines.
* On the Caboolture, Sunshine Coast and Redcliffe Peninsula line, trains may run express to reduce travel time. A notable example is the trains on the Cabooolture and Sunshine Coast lines run express from Petrie to Bowen Hills, stopping only at Northgate, Eagle Junction and Bowen Hills; previously before the timetable changes, average commute time from Caboolture to Central was 1 hour and 6 minutes. After the timetable changes, it was reduced to 51 minutes, a saving of 15 minutes. 
* Introduction of the South East Bikeway, which runs alongside the South East Busway to allow for cycle commuting from the Southern suburbs. Some paths along the Brisbane River are also widened to include a specific bikeway section (particularly between Toowong and North Quay). 
* Prohibition of parking along busy roads during peak traffic periods to create an extra lane for traffic.

In Sydney, congestion is managed by many means including:
* Buses increase frequency from 4 per hour to 12 per hour on the Metrobus network, other routes increase limited and express services
* The Sydney Trains network runs double-decker electric multiple unit trains that allowed many more passengers to board the trains compared to the 1950s single-level &#x27;Red Rattlers&#x27;, and &#x27;Silver Ghosts&#x27;.
* Time-of-day ticket prices allow train commuters to board trains before 6 am or after 7 pm at a cheaper rate on single or day return tickets
* Transit and/or HOV Lanes are installed on many major arterial roads, 
* The Rail Clearways Program, which allows for broken-down trains on the Sydney Trains network to not affect the running of trains on separate lines due to building bypasses, and loop-backs alongside the existing track
* The Inner West Light Rail, which was the first operational light rail line in Sydney, increases headways during peak hour, providing services up to every eight minutes.

Traffic congestion is managed through the Traffic Management Centre via a network of Closed Circuit TV&#x27;s, with operators able to change the timing of traffic signals to reduce wait times
* Most major motorways have the ability for contraflow lane to allow continuing flow of traffic in case of a major accident
* Older motor ways have been upgraded from two lanes in each direction, to three lanes in each direction
* Motor way toll booths have been replaced with electronic toll systems (M2 Hills Motorway was the last to do so on 21 January 2012); time-of-day tolling is in use on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel to provide cash incentives for commuters to remain out of the city in peak times.

===Brazil===
In São Paulo, Brazil, each vehicle is assigned a certain day of the week in which it cannot travel the roads during rush hour (7–10 am and 5–8 pm). The day of the week for each vehicle is derived from the last digit in the licence plate number and the rule is enforced by traffic police (1 and 2 for Mondays, 3 and 4 for Tuesdays, 5 and 6 for Wednesdays, 7 and 8 for Thursdays and 9 and 10 for Fridays). This policy is aimed at reducing the number of vehicles on the roads and encouraging the use of buses, subway and the urban train systems.

===Canada===
Vancouver&#x27;s portion of the Trans-Canada Highway is served with high-occupancy vehicle lanes in addition to standard lanes for all automobiles. These lanes are meant to improve traffic flow by encouraging carpooling and transit use. Richmond, part of the Vancouver metro region, is also constructing a new interchange at Steveson Highway and British Columbia Highway 99 which will be the first of its kind in British Columbia in an effort to improve traffic flow.

Kelowna&#x27;s Harvey Avenue is served also by HOV lanes.

=== China ===

China is home to some of the busiest subway networks in the world. Despite aggressive expansion of rapid transit networks in the past decade, rapid urban population growth has put heavy demand on urban transport. Some systems routinely restrict station entrances and transfer passages to prevent the network from being overwhelmed. For example, 96 subway stations in the Beijing Subway have entry restrictions at some point of the day. The Guangzhou Metro has 51 stations with passenger flow restrictions.

===Colombia===
In the &quot;pico y placa&quot; (peak and license plate) program in Bogotá, drivers of non-commercial automobiles are prevented from driving them during rush hours on certain days of the week. The vehicles barred each day are determined by the last digit of their license plate. The measure is mandatory and those who break it are penalized. The digits banned each day are rotated every year.

===Japan===

In Japan, the proportion of rail transportation is high compared with the use of automobiles. Rail transport accounts for 27% of all passenger transport in Japan (other examples: Germany (7.7%), United Kingdom (6.4%), United States (0.6%)). In the Greater Tokyo Area and the Keihanshin metropolitan area there is a dense rail network and frequent service, which accounts for more than half of the passenger transport; most people in the area commute by public transport without using cars.

Railways in the Greater Tokyo Area are traditionally known to be severely congested, with oshiya employed to assist passengers getting on the train. This is gradually being improved by increasing rail capacity and demand management. Train lines in Tokyo have had significant reductions in overcrowding and today run at an average of 163 percent of capacity. This is in contrast to the average loading of 221 percent of designed capacity in 1975 rush-hour trains.

In road transport, the expressways of Japan operate on a beneficiaries-pay principle which imposes expensive toll fees, having the effect of reducing road traffic. Electronic toll collection (ETC) is widespread and discounts during low-traffic periods have been introduced to distribute traffic over a longer period. Road pricing is being considered but has not been introduced, partly because the expressway fee is already very high.

===Netherlands===
For trains in the Netherlands there is an off-peak discount available, giving a 40% discount. Its validity starts at 9am (until 4am the next morning) on weekdays, and all day at weekends and in July and August. In the case of a group of up to four people, all get the discount even if only one has a pass.

Rail passes not requiring an additional ticket come in two versions: for a fixed route, and for the whole network. Both are mainly used by commuters. No off-peak discount version of these passes is offered since there is insufficient demand; commuters usually cannot avoid the rush hour.

===Philippines===

Inside Metro Manila, the Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program, popularly known as the &quot;number coding scheme&quot;, is implemented by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. The program stipulates that vehicles are prohibited from plying all roads within the metropolis, depending on the last digit of their license plates and on the day of the week.

The vehicles are banned from 7am to 7pm. Unlike the public vehicles, the private vehicles have a five-hour window exception which runs from 10am to 3pm. However, the cities of Makati and San Juan do not implement the five-hour window.

This table shows the license plates with numbers ending with its corresponding days:

Exempted from the program are motorcycles, school buses, shuttle buses, ambulances, fire engines, police cars, military vehicles, those carrying a person needing immediate medical attention, and vehicles with diplomatic license plates.

On the other hand, in other places, there are certain policies the municipal or city government are proposing or has implemented for the whole municipality or city.

While most schools are open, peak hours in rapid transit trains on Manila Metro Rail Transit System and Manila Light Rail Transit System, and in commuter trains on Philippine National Railways are 6-9am and 4-8pm.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, there is a free travel scheme before 7:45am and 50 cent discount between 7:45am and 8am, which applies only if you exit and not enter at the 18 CBD stations. This is an attempt to encourage commuters&#x27; travel on the MRT outside the crowded weekday morning peak. Electronic Road Pricing is intended to discourage driving between 7:30am and 8pm. In addition, employees were given travel incentives through Travel Smart programme. Peak hours are defined as follows: 7:30–9:30 am and 5–8 pm, with different times for terminal stations.

===United Kingdom===
In London, Peak Day Travelcards allow travel at all hours. Off-peak Day Travelcards are 20–50% cheaper but are valid for travel only after 9:30am and on weekends. This is an attempt to encourage commuters&#x27; travel on the London Underground, Docklands Light Railway, buses, and trams outside of the crowded weekday morning peak. There is a similar system on Transport (Bus and Tyne and Wear Metro) in the Newcastle upon Tyne area. In London, congestion charges are intended to discourage driving between 7am and 6pm.

In Manchester, the Metrolink light rail system offers single, return and &#x27;Metromax&#x27; daysaver tickets at a reduced price when they are purchased after 9:30am. This incentive is designed to lure passengers into avoiding the daily crowded conditions at Metrolink stations during rush hour.

For 16–25 Railcard holders, the offer of one-third off ticket prices is valid only after 10 am (unless a minimum fare is paid) or weekends. This restriction does not apply in July and August, the main summer holiday season.

For other Railcards, other restrictions apply; for example, the Family Railcard and Network Railcard cannot be used for peak journeys within London and south-east England.

===United States===
Efforts to manage transportation demand during rush hour periods vary by state and by metropolitan area. In some states, freeways have designated lanes that become HOV (High-Occupancy Vehicle, aka car-pooling) only during rush hours, while open to all vehicles at other times. In others, such as the Massachusetts portion of I-93, travel is permitted in the breakdown lane during this time. Several states use ramp meters to regulate traffic entering freeways during rush hour. Transportation officials in Colorado and Minnesota have added value pricing to some urban freeways around Denver, the Twin Cities, and Seattle, charging motorists a higher toll during peak periods.

Transit agencies such as Metro-North serving New York City often charge riders a higher &quot;peak fare&quot; for travel during the morning and evening rush hour.
Heavy traffic within the larger Greater Boston region was addressed with the Big Dig project, which temporarily improved expressway traffic.

==Third rush hour==
The term &quot;third rush hour&quot; has been used to refer to a period of the midday in which roads in urban and suburban areas become congested due to numerous people taking lunch breaks using their vehicles. These motorists often frequent restaurants and fast food locations, where vehicles crowding the entrances cause traffic congestion.

a. Crowding levels defined by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism:

:100% — Commuters have enough personal space and are able to take a seat or stand while holding onto the straps or hand rails.
:150% — Commuters have enough personal space to read a newspaper.
:180% — Commuters must fold newspapers to read.
:200% — Commuters are pressed against each other in each compartment but can still read small magazines.
:250% — Commuters are pressed against each other, unable to move.

<text>A storm surge, storm flood, tidal surge, or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with low-pressure weather systems, such as cyclones. It is measured as the rise in water level above the normal tidal level, and does not include waves.

The main meteorological factor contributing to a storm surge is high-speed wind pushing water towards the coast over a long fetch. Other factors affecting storm surge severity include the shallowness and orientation of the water body in the storm path, the timing of tides, and the atmospheric pressure drop due to the storm.

As extreme weather becomes more intense and the sea level rises due to climate change, storm surges are expected to cause more risk to coastal populations. Communities and governments can adapt by building hard infrastructure, like surge barriers, soft infrastructure, like coastal dunes or mangroves, improving coastal construction practices and building social strategies such as early warning, education and evacuation plans.

==Mechanics==
At least five processes can be involved in altering tide levels during storms.

===Direct wind effect===
Wind stresses cause a phenomenon referred to as wind setup, which is the tendency for water levels to increase at the downwind shore and to decrease at the upwind shore. Intuitively, this is caused by the storm blowing the water toward one side of the basin in the direction of its winds. Strong surface winds cause surface currents at a 45° angle to the wind direction, by an effect known as the Ekman spiral. Because the Ekman spiral effects spread vertically through the water, the effect is proportional to depth. The surge will be driven into bays in the same way as the astronomical tide.

===Atmospheric pressure effect===
The pressure effects of a tropical cyclone will cause the water level in the open ocean to rise in regions of low atmospheric pressure and fall in regions of high atmospheric pressure. The rising water level will counteract the low atmospheric pressure such that the total pressure at some plane beneath the water surface remains constant. This effect is estimated at a increase in sea level for every millibar (hPa) drop in atmospheric pressure. For example, a major storm with a 100 millibar pressure drop would be expected to have a water level rise from the pressure effect.

===Effect of the Earth&#x27;s rotation===
The Earth&#x27;s rotation causes the Coriolis effect, which bends currents to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify the surge, and when it bends the current away from the shore it has the effect of lessening the surge.

===Effect of waves===
The effect of waves, while directly powered by the wind, is distinct from a storm&#x27;s wind-powered currents. Powerful wind whips up large, strong waves in the direction of its movement. Although these surface waves are responsible for very little water transport in open water, they may be responsible for significant transport near the shore. When waves are breaking on a line more or less parallel to the beach, they carry considerable water shoreward. As they break, the water moving toward the shore has considerable momentum and may run up a sloping beach to an elevation above the mean water line, which may exceed twice the wave height before breaking.

===Rainfall effect===
The rainfall effect is experienced predominantly in estuaries. Hurricanes may dump as much as of rainfall in 24 hours over large areas and higher rainfall densities in localized areas. As a result, surface runoff can quickly flood streams and rivers. This can increase the water level near the head of tidal estuaries as storm-driven waters surging in from the ocean meet rainfall flowing downstream into the estuary.

===Sea depth and topography===
In addition to the above processes, storm surge and wave heights on shore are also affected by the flow of water over the underlying topography, i.e. the shape and depth of the ocean floor and coastal area. A narrow shelf, with deep water relatively close to the shoreline, tends to produce a lower surge but higher and more powerful waves. A wide shelf, with shallower water, tends to produce a higher storm surge with relatively smaller waves.

For example, in Palm Beach on the southeast coast of Florida, the water depth reaches offshore, and out. This is relatively steep and deep; storm surge is not as great but the waves are larger compared to the west coast of Florida. Conversely, on the Gulf side of Florida, the edge of the Floridian Plateau can lie more than offshore. Florida Bay, lying between the Florida Keys and the mainland, is very shallow with depths between and . These shallow areas are subject to higher storm surges with smaller waves. Other shallow areas include much of the Gulf of Mexico coast, and the Bay of Bengal.

The difference is due to how much flow area the storm surge can dissipate to. In deeper water, there is more area and a surge can be dispersed down and away from the hurricane. On a shallow, gently sloping shelf, the surge has less room to disperse and is driven ashore by the wind forces of the hurricane.

The topography of the land surface is another important element in storm surge extent. Areas, where the land lies less than a few meters above sea level, are at particular risk from storm surge inundation.

===Storm size===
The size of the storm also affects the surge height; this is due to the storm&#x27;s area not being proportional to its perimeter. If a storm doubles in diameter, its perimeter also doubles, but its area quadruples. As there is proportionally less perimeter for the surge to dissipate to, the surge height ends up being higher.
==Extratropical storms==
Similar to tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones cause an offshore rise of water. However, unlike most tropical cyclone storm surges, extratropical cyclones can cause higher water levels across a large area for longer periods of time, depending on the system.

In North America, extratropical storm surges may occur on the Pacific and Alaska coasts, and north of 31°N on the Atlantic Coast. Coasts with sea ice may experience an &quot;ice tsunami&quot; causing significant damage inland. Extratropical storm surges may be possible further south for the Gulf coast mostly during the wintertime, when extratropical cyclones affect the coast, such as in the 1993 Storm of the Century.

November 9–13, 2009, marked a significant extratropical storm surge event on the United States east coast when the remnants of Hurricane Ida developed into a nor&#x27;easter off the southeast U.S. coast. During the event, winds from the east were present along the northern periphery of the low-pressure center for a number of days, forcing water into locations such as Chesapeake Bay. Water levels rose significantly and remained as high as above normal in numerous locations throughout the Chesapeake for a number of days as water was continually built-up inside the estuary from the onshore winds and freshwater rains flowing into the bay. In many locations, water levels were shy of records by only .

==Measuring surge==
Surge can be measured directly at coastal tidal stations as the difference between the forecast tide and the observed rise of water. Another method of measuring surge is by the deployment of pressure transducers along the coastline just ahead of an approaching tropical cyclone. This was first tested for Hurricane Rita in 2005. These types of sensors can be placed in locations that will be submerged and can accurately measure the height of water above them.

After surge from a cyclone has receded, teams of surveyors map high-water marks (HWM) on land, in a rigorous and detailed process that includes photographs and written descriptions of the marks. HWMs denote the location and elevation of floodwaters from a storm event. When HWMs are analyzed, if the various components of the water height can be broken out so that the portion attributable to surge can be identified, then that mark can be classified as storm surge. Otherwise, it is classified as storm tide. HWMs on land are referenced to a vertical datum (a reference coordinate system). During the evaluation, HWMs are divided into four categories based on the confidence in the mark; in the U.S., only HWMs evaluated as &quot;excellent&quot; are used by the National Hurricane Center in the post-storm analysis of the surge.

Two different measures are used for storm tide and storm surge measurements. Storm tide is measured using a geodetic vertical datum (NGVD 29 or NAVD 88). Since storm surge is defined as the rise of water beyond what would be expected by the normal movement caused by tides, storm surge is measured using tidal predictions, with the assumption that the tide prediction is well-known and only slowly varying in the region subject to the surge. Since tides are a localized phenomenon, storm surge can only be measured in relationship to a nearby tidal station. Tidal benchmark information at a station provides a translation from the geodetic vertical datum to mean sea level (MSL) at that location, then subtracting the tidal prediction yields a surge height above the normal water height.

==SLOSH==
The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts storm surge using the SLOSH model, which is an abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes. The model is accurate to within 20 percent. SLOSH inputs include the central pressure of a tropical cyclone, storm size, the cyclone&#x27;s forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds. Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, as well as other physical features, are taken into account in a predefined grid referred to as a SLOSH basin. Overlapping SLOSH basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S. Some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the Lake Pontchartrain / New Orleans basin, and the Mississippi Sound basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall. The final output from the model run will display the maximum envelope of water, or MEOW, that occurred at each location.

To allow for track or forecast uncertainties, usually several model runs with varying input parameters are generated to create a map of MOMs or Maximum of Maximums. For hurricane evacuation studies, a family of storms with representative tracks for the region, and varying intensity, eye diameter, and speed are modeled to produce worst-case water heights for any tropical cyclone occurrence. The results of these studies are typically generated from several thousand SLOSH runs. These studies have been completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, under contract to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for several states and are available on their Hurricane Evacuation Studies (HES) website. They include coastal county maps, shaded to identify the minimum category of hurricane that will result in flooding, in each area of the county.

== Impacts ==

Storm surge is responsible for significant property damage and loss of life as part of cyclones. Storm surge both destroys built infrastructure, like roads, and undermines foundations and building structures.

Unexpected flooding in estuaries and coastal areas can catch populations unprepared, causing loss of life. The deadliest storm surge on record was the 1970 Bhola cyclone.

Additionally, storm surge can cause or transform human-utilized land through other processes, hurting soil fertility, increasing saltwater intrusion, hurting wildlife habitat, and spreading chemical or other contaminants from human storage.

==Mitigation==
Although meteorological surveys alert about hurricanes or severe storms, in the areas where the risk of coastal flooding is particularly high, there are specific storm surge warnings. These have been implemented, for instance, in the Netherlands, Spain, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Similarly educating coastal communities and developing local evacuation plans can reduce the relative impact on people.

A prophylactic method introduced after the North Sea flood of 1953 is the construction of dams and storm-surge barriers (flood barriers). They are open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. Major storm surge barriers are the Oosterscheldekering and Maeslantkering in the Netherlands, which are part of the Delta Works project; the Thames Barrier protecting London; and the Saint Petersburg Dam in Russia.

Another modern development (in use in the Netherlands) is the creation of housing communities at the edges of wetlands with floating structures, restrained in position by vertical pylons. Such wetlands can then be used to accommodate runoff and surges without causing damage to the structures while also protecting conventional structures at somewhat higher low-lying elevations, provided that dikes prevent major surge intrusion.

Other soft adaptation methods can include changing structures so that they are elevated to avoid flooding directly, or increasing natural protections like mangroves or dunes.

For mainland areas, storm surge is more of a threat when the storm strikes land from seaward, rather than approaching from landward.

==Reverse storm surge==
Water can also be sucked away from shore prior to a storm surge. This was the case on the western Florida coast in 2017, just before Hurricane Irma made landfall, uncovering land usually underwater. This phenomenon is known as a reverse storm surge, or a negative storm surge.

== Historic storm surges ==

The deadliest storm surge on record was the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed up to 500,000 people in the area of the Bay of Bengal. The low-lying coast of the Bay of Bengal is particularly vulnerable to surges caused by tropical cyclones. The deadliest storm surge in the twenty-first century was caused by Cyclone Nargis, which killed more than 138,000 people in Myanmar in May 2008. The next deadliest in this century was caused by Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), which killed more than 6,000 people in the central Philippines in 2013. and resulted in economic losses estimated at $14 billion (USD).

The 1900 Galveston hurricane, a Category 4 hurricane that struck Galveston, Texas, drove a devastating surge ashore; between 6,000 and 12,000 people died, making it the deadliest natural disaster ever to strike the United States.

The highest storm tide noted in historical accounts was produced by the 1899 Cyclone Mahina, estimated at almost at Bathurst Bay, Australia, but research published in 2000 concluded that the majority of this likely was wave run-up because of the steep coastal topography. However, much of this storm surge was likely due to Mahina&#x27;s extreme intensity, as computer modeling required an intensity of (the same intensity as the lowest recorded pressure from the storm) to produce the recorded storm surge. In the United States, one of the greatest recorded storm surges was generated by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, which produced a maximum storm surge of more than in southern Mississippi, with a storm surge height of in Pass Christian. Another record storm surge occurred in this same area from Hurricane Camille in 1969, with a storm tide of , also at Pass Christian. A storm surge of occurred in New York City during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012.

<doc id="449745" wikidata="Q1154787" url="?curid=449745" title="Theta function">
<text>In mathematics, theta functions are special functions of several complex variables. They show up in many topics, including Abelian varieties, moduli spaces, quadratic forms, and solitons. Theta functions are parametrized by points in a tube domain inside a complex Lagrangian Grassmannian, namely the Siegel upper half space.

The most common form of theta function is that occurring in the theory of elliptic functions. With respect to one of the complex variables (conventionally called ), a theta function has a property expressing its behavior with respect to the addition of a period of the associated elliptic functions, making it a quasiperiodic function. In the abstract theory this quasiperiodicity comes from the cohomology class of a line bundle on a complex torus, a condition of descent.

One interpretation of theta functions when dealing with the heat equation is that &quot;a theta function is a special function that describes the evolution of temperature on a segment domain subject to certain boundary conditions&quot;.

Throughout this article, formula_1 should be interpreted as formula_2 (in order to resolve issues of choice of branch).

==Jacobi theta function==

There are several closely related functions called Jacobi theta functions, and many different and incompatible systems of notation for them. 
One Jacobi theta function (named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi) is a function defined for two complex variables and , where can be any complex number and is the half-period ratio, confined to the upper half-plane, which means it has a positive imaginary part. It is given by the formula

:formula_3

where is the nome and . It is a Jacobi form. The restriction ensures that it is an absolutely convergent series. At fixed , this is a Fourier series for a 1-periodic entire function of . Accordingly, the theta function is 1-periodic in :

:formula_4

By completing the square, it is also -quasiperiodic in , with

:formula_5

Thus, in general,

:formula_6

for any integers and .

For any fixed formula_7, the function is an entire function on the complex plane, so by Liouville&#x27;s theorem, it cannot be doubly periodic in formula_8 unless it is constant, and so the best we could do is to make it periodic in formula_9 and quasi-periodic in formula_7. Indeed, since formula_11and formula_12, the function formula_13 is unbounded, as required by Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

It is in fact the most general entire function with 2 quasi-periods, in the following sense:

==Auxiliary functions==

The Jacobi theta function defined above is sometimes considered along with three auxiliary theta functions, in which case it is written with a double 0 subscript:

:formula_14

The auxiliary (or half-period) functions are defined by

:formula_15

This notation follows Riemann and Mumford; Jacobi&#x27;s original formulation was in terms of the nome rather than . In Jacobi&#x27;s notation the -functions are written:

:formula_16


The above definitions of the Jacobi theta functions are by no means unique. See Jacobi theta functions (notational variations) for further discussion.

If we set in the above theta functions, we obtain four functions of only, defined on the upper half-plane. These functions are called &quot;Theta Nullwert&quot; functions, based on the German term for &quot;zero value&quot; because of the annullation of the left entry in the theta function expression. Alternatively, we obtain four functions of only, defined on the unit disk formula_17. They are sometimes called theta constants:

:formula_18

with the nome . 
Observe that formula_19. 
These can be used to define a variety of modular forms, and to parametrize certain curves; in particular, the Jacobi identity is

:formula_20

or equivalently,

:formula_21

which is the Fermat curve of degree four.

== Jacobi identities ==
Jacobi&#x27;s identities describe how theta functions transform under the modular group, which is generated by and . Equations for the first transform are easily found since adding one to in the exponent has the same effect as adding to (). For the second, let

:formula_22

Then

:formula_23

==Theta functions in terms of the nome==
Instead of expressing the Theta functions in terms of and , we may express them in terms of arguments and the nome , where and . In this form, the functions become

:formula_24

We see that the theta functions can also be defined in terms of and , without a direct reference to the exponential function. These formulas can, therefore, be used to define the Theta functions over other fields where the exponential function might not be everywhere defined, such as fields of -adic numbers.

==Product representations==
The Jacobi triple product (a special case of the Macdonald identities) tells us that for complex numbers and with and we have
:formula_25

It can be proven by elementary means, as for instance in Hardy and Wright&#x27;s &quot;An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers&quot;.

If we express the theta function in terms of the nome (noting some authors instead set ) and take then

:formula_26

We therefore obtain a product formula for the theta function in the form

:formula_27

In terms of and :
:formula_28

where is the -Pochhammer symbol and is the -theta function. Expanding terms out, the Jacobi triple product can also be written

:formula_29

which we may also write as

:formula_30

This form is valid in general but clearly is of particular interest when is real. Similar product formulas for the auxiliary theta functions are

:formula_31
In particular, formula_32so we may interpret them as one-parameter deformations of the periodic functions formula_33, again validating the interpretation of the theta function as the most general 2 quasi-period function.

==Integral representations==
The Jacobi theta functions have the following integral representations:

:formula_34

The Theta Nullwert function formula_35 as this integral identity:

:formula_36

This formula was discussed in the essay &quot;Square series generating function transformations&quot; by the mathematician Maxie Schmidt from Georgia in Atlanta.

Based on this formula following three eminent examples are given:

:formula_37

:formula_38

:formula_39

Furthermore, the theta examples formula_40 and formula_41 shall be displayed:

:formula_42

:formula_43

:formula_44

:formula_45

==Some interesting relations==

If formula_17 and formula_47, then the following theta functions

:formula_48
:formula_49

have interesting arithmetical and modular properties. When formula_50 are positive integers, then 

:formula_51

:formula_52

Also if formula_53, formula_54, the functions with :

:formula_55

and

:formula_56

are modular forms with weight formula_57 in formula_58 i.e. If formula_59 are integers such that formula_60, formula_61 and formula_62 there exists formula_63, formula_64, such that for all complex numbers formula_65 with formula_54, we have

:formula_67

==Explicit values==
=== Lemniscatic values ===

Proper credit for most of these results goes to Ramanujan. See Ramanujan&#x27;s lost notebook and a relevant reference at Euler function. The Ramanujan results quoted at Euler function plus a few elementary operations give the results below, so they are either in Ramanujan&#x27;s lost notebook or follow immediately from it. See also Yi (2004). Define,

:formula_68

with the nome formula_69 formula_70 and Dedekind eta function formula_71 Then for formula_72

:formula_73

If the reciprocal of the Gelfond constant is raised to the power of the reciprocal of an odd number, then the corresponding formula_74 values or formula_75 values can be represented in a simplified way by using the hyperbolic lemniscatic sine:

:formula_76

:formula_77

:formula_78

:formula_79

With the letter formula_80 the Lemniscate constant is represented.

Note that the following modular identities hold:

:formula_81

where formula_82 is the Rogers–Ramanujan continued fraction:

:formula_83

=== Equianharmonic values ===
The mathematician Bruce Berndt found out further values of the theta function:

:formula_84

=== Further values ===
Many values of the theta function and especially of the shown phi function can be represented in terms of the gamma function:

:formula_85

==Nome power theorems==

===Direct power theorems===

For the transformation of the nome in the theta functions these formulas can be used:

:formula_86
:formula_87
:formula_88

The squares of the three theta zero-value functions with the square function as the inner function are also formed in the pattern of the Pythagorean triples according to the Jacobi Identity. Furthermore, those transformations are valid:

:formula_89

These formulas can be used to compute the theta values of the cube of the nome:

:formula_90

:formula_91

And the following formulas can be used to compute the theta values of the fifth power of the nome:

:formula_92

:formula_93

=== Transformation at the cube root of the nome ===
The formulas for the theta Nullwert function values from the cube root of the elliptic nome are obtained by contrasting the two real solutions of the corresponding quartic equations:

: formula_94

: formula_95

=== Transformation at the fifth root of the nome ===
The Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction can be defined in terms of the Jacobi theta function in the following way:

: formula_96

: formula_97

: formula_98

The alternating Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction function S(q) has the following two identities:

: formula_99

The theta function values from the fifth root of the nome can be represented as a rational combination of the continued fractions R and S and the theta function values from the fifth power of the nome and the nome itself. The following four equations are valid for all values q between 0 and 1:

: formula_100
: formula_101
: formula_102
: formula_103

=== Modulus dependent theorems===

In combination with the elliptic modulus, the following formulas can be displayed:

These are the formulas for the square of the elliptic nome:

:formula_104
:formula_105
:formula_106

And this is an efficient formula for the cube of the nome:

:formula_107

For all real values formula_108 the now mentioned formula is valid.

And for this formula two examples shall be given:

First calculation example with the value formula_109 inserted:

Second calculation example with the value formula_110 inserted:

The constant formula_111 represents the Golden ratio number formula_112 exactly.

==Some series identities==

===Sums with theta function in the result===

The infinite sum of the reciprocals of Fibonacci numbers with odd indices has this identity:

:formula_113
:formula_114

By not using the theta function expression, following identity between two sums can be formulated:

:formula_115

:formula_116

Also in this case formula_112 is Golden ratio number again.

Infinite sum of the reciprocals of the Fibonacci number squares:
:formula_118

Infinite sum of the reciprocals of the Pell numbers with odd indices:
:formula_119

===Sums with theta function in the summand===
The next two series identities were proved by István Mező:

:formula_120

These relations hold for all . Specializing the values of , we have the next parameter free sums

:formula_121

:formula_122

==Zeros of the Jacobi theta functions==
All zeros of the Jacobi theta functions are simple zeros and are given by the following:

:formula_123
where , are arbitrary integers.

==Relation to the Riemann zeta function==
The relation

:formula_124

was used by Riemann to prove the functional equation for the Riemann zeta function, by means of the Mellin transform

:formula_125

which can be shown to be invariant under substitution of by . The corresponding integral for is given in the article on the Hurwitz zeta function.

==Relation to the Weierstrass elliptic function==
The theta function was used by Jacobi to construct (in a form adapted to easy calculation) his elliptic functions as the quotients of the above four theta functions, and could have been used by him to construct Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic functions also, since

:formula_126

where the second derivative is with respect to and the constant is defined so that the Laurent expansion of at has zero constant term.

==Relation to the &quot;q&quot;-gamma function==

The fourth theta function – and thus the others too – is intimately connected to the Jackson -gamma function via the relation

:formula_127

==Relations to Dedekind eta function==
Let be the Dedekind eta function, and the argument of the theta function as the nome . Then,

:formula_128

and,

:formula_129

See also the Weber modular functions.

==Elliptic modulus==
The elliptic modulus is
:formula_130
and the complementary elliptic modulus is
:formula_131

== Derivatives of theta functions ==

These are two identical definitions of the complete elliptic integral of the second kind:

:formula_132

:formula_133

The derivatives of the Theta Nullwert functions have these MacLaurin series:

:formula_134

:formula_135

:formula_136

The derivatives of theta zero-value functions are as follows:
:formula_137
:formula_138
:formula_139

The two last mentioned formulas are valid for all real numbers of the real definition interval: formula_140

And these two last named theta derivative functions are related to each other in this way:
:formula_141

The derivatives of the quotients from two of the three theta functions mentioned here always have a rational relationship to those three functions:
:formula_142
:formula_143
:formula_144

For the derivation of these derivation formulas see the articles Nome (mathematics) and Modular lambda function!

== Integrals of theta functions ==

For the theta functions these integrals are valid:

:formula_145
:formula_146
:formula_147

The final results now shown are based on the general Cauchy sum formulas.

==A solution to the heat equation==
The Jacobi theta function is the fundamental solution of the one-dimensional heat equation with spatially periodic boundary conditions. Taking to be real and with real and positive, we can write

:formula_148

which solves the heat equation

:formula_149

This theta-function solution is 1-periodic in , and as it approaches the periodic delta function, or Dirac comb, in the sense of distributions

:formula_150.

General solutions of the spatially periodic initial value problem for the heat equation may be obtained by convolving the initial data at with the theta function.

==Relation to the Heisenberg group==
The Jacobi theta function is invariant under the action of a discrete subgroup of the Heisenberg group. This invariance is presented in the article on the theta representation of the Heisenberg group.

==Generalizations==

If is a quadratic form in variables, then the theta function associated with is

:formula_151

with the sum extending over the lattice of integers formula_152. This theta function is a modular form of weight (on an appropriately defined subgroup) of the modular group. In the Fourier expansion,

:formula_153

the numbers are called the &quot;representation numbers&quot; of the form.

===Theta series of a Dirichlet character===

For a primitive Dirichlet character modulo and then

:formula_154

is a weight modular form of level and character
:formula_155
which means

:formula_156

whenever

:formula_157

===Ramanujan theta function===
===Riemann theta function===
Let

:formula_158

be the set of symmetric square matrices whose imaginary part is positive definite. formula_159 is called the Siegel upper half-space and is the multi-dimensional analog of the upper half-plane. The -dimensional analogue of the modular group is the symplectic group ; for , . The -dimensional analogue of the congruence subgroups is played by

:formula_160

Then, given , the Riemann theta function is defined as

:formula_161

Here, is an -dimensional complex vector, and the superscript T denotes the transpose. The Jacobi theta function is then a special case, with and where is the upper half-plane. One major application of the Riemann theta function is that it allows one to give explicit formulas for meromorphic functions on compact Riemann surfaces, as well as other auxiliary objects that figure prominently in their function theory, by taking to be the period matrix with respect to a canonical basis for its first homology group.

The Riemann theta converges absolutely and uniformly on compact subsets of formula_162.

The functional equation is

:formula_163

which holds for all vectors , and for all and .

===Poincaré series===
The Poincaré series generalizes the theta series to automorphic forms with respect to arbitrary Fuchsian groups.

== Derivation of the theta values ==

=== Identity of the Euler beta function ===
In the following, three important theta function values are to be derived as examples:

This is how the Euler beta function is defined in its reduced form:

:formula_164

In general, for all natural numbers formula_165 this formula of the Euler beta function is valid:

:formula_166

=== Exemplary elliptic integrals ===

In the following some &quot;Elliptic Integral Singular Values&quot; are derived:

=== Combination of the integral identities with the nome ===

The elliptic nome function has these important values:
:formula_167

:formula_168

:formula_169

For the proof of the correctness of these nome values, see the article Nome (mathematics)!

On the basis of these integral identities and the above-mentioned Definition and identities to the theta functions in the same section of this article, exemplary theta zero values shall be determined now:
:formula_170

:formula_171

:formula_172

:formula_173

== Partition sequences and Pochhammer products ==

=== Regular partition number sequence ===

The regular partition sequence formula_174 itself indicates the number of ways in which a positive integer number formula_175 can be splitted into positive integer summands. For the numbers formula_176 to formula_177, the associated partition numbers formula_178 with all associated number partitions are listed in the following table:

The generating function of the regular partition number sequence can be represented via Pochhammer product in the following way:
: formula_179

The summandization of the now mentioned Pochhammer product is described by the Pentagonal number theorem in this way:

:formula_180

The following basic definitions apply to the pentagonal numbers and the card house numbers:

: formula_181
: formula_182

As a further application one obtains a formula for the third power of the Euler product:
:formula_183

=== Strict partition number sequence ===

And the strict partition sequence formula_184 indicates the number of ways in which such a positive integer number formula_175 can be splitted into positive integer summands such that each summand appears at most once and no summand value occurs repeatedly. Exactly the same sequence is also generated if in the partition only odd summands are included, but these odd summands may occur more than once. Both representations for the strict partition number sequence are compared in the following table:

The generating function of the strict partition number sequence can be represented using Pochhammer&#x27;s product:
: formula_186

=== Overpartition number sequence ===

The Maclaurin series for the reciprocal of the function has the numbers of over partition sequence as coefficients with a positive sign:

: formula_187
: formula_188

If, for a given number formula_189, all partitions are set up in such a way that the summand size never increases, and all those summands that do not have a summand of the same size to the left of themselves can be marked for each partition of this type, then it will be the resulting number of the marked partitions depending on formula_189 by the overpartition function formula_191 .

First example:

: formula_192

These 14 possibilities of partition markings exist for the sum 4:

Second example:

: formula_193

These 24 possibilities of partition markings exist for the sum 5:

=== Relations of the partition number sequences to each other ===
In the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), the sequence of regular partition numbers formula_174 is under the code A000041, the sequence of strict partitions is formula_195 under the code A000009 and the sequence of superpartitions formula_196 under the code A015128. All parent partitions from index formula_176 are even.

The sequence of superpartitions formula_196 can be written with the regular partition sequence P and the strict partition sequence Q can be generated like this:
: formula_199
In the following table of sequences of numbers, this formula should be used as an example:

Related to this property, the following combination of two series of sums can also be set up via the function :

<doc id="449746" wikidata="Q1891518" url="?curid=449746" title="Shonen Knife">
<text>Shonen Knife is a Japanese pop-punk band formed in Osaka in 1981. Influenced by 1960s girl groups, pop bands, the Beach Boys, and early punk rock bands such as the Ramones, the band crafts stripped-down songs with simple yet unconventional lyrics sung both in Japanese and English.

The band has been credited with making &quot;the international pop underground more international&quot; by &quot;opening it up to bands from Japan&quot;. They have also performed as a Ramones tribute band under the name the Osaka Ramones. Guitarist/singer Naoko Yamano is the only member to have remained with the band for its entire history; her sister Atsuko Yamano was a founding member and, after a long hiatus, returned to the band in 2016. They have released 22 studio albums; their most recent album &quot;Our Best Place&quot; was released in February 2023.

In the words of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, &quot;something oddly spellbinding occurs when deceivingly silly lyrics are sandwiched between a buoyant guitar and a rapid-fire, pop-punk drum kit. Which perhaps explains why the Japanese female alternative rock/pop punk trio Shonen Knife is still singing songs about cookies, sushi, jelly beans, and, of course, banana chips.&quot;

==Biography==
===Formation and early years===
Shonen Knife was formed in December 1981 in Osaka, Japan, by Naoko Yamano on guitar and vocals; her college friend Michie Nakatani on bass, keyboards, and vocals; and Naoko&#x27;s then 17-year-old sister Atsuko Yamano on drums. Naoko and Michie had both worked at office jobs; Atsuko had received training as a fashion designer and has created many of the band&#x27;s stage outfits. The band was named after an old brand of pen knife that had been marketed to Japanese boys. At the time of their formation, Shonen Knife was a relative anomaly because all-female rock bands were rare in Japan at the time. While cultivating a punk rock sound, the band emphasized positivity using catchy, upbeat melodies and simple, carefree lyrics that often dealt with sweets, animals, and consumer culture. As explained by Nakatani in an interview, &quot;We&#x27;ve always enjoyed writing songs about everyday things. Besides, there are already enough bands out there singing about pollution, war and poverty. While we all care very much about those things, we also feel that music should be fun.&quot;
They played their first gig in Osaka in March 1982, and self-released the cassette-only album &quot;Minna Tanoshiku&quot; later that year. Their first full-length album &quot;Burning Farm&quot; was released in 1983, followed by &quot;Yama-no Attchan&quot; in 1984. While the band&#x27;s early albums were only officially released in Japan, imported copies attracted a cult following among alternative rock fans in the United States. In 1985, &quot;Burning Farm&quot; attracted the attention of K Records in Olympia, Washington, which re-released the album in America.

In 1986 the band released multiple international versions of the album &quot;Pretty Little Baka Guy&quot;, with the American version issued by Sub Pop, and their song &quot;One Day of the Factory&quot; appeared on an international compilation released by that label. In 1987, Shonen Knife was invited to open for Sonic Youth in Osaka, and played internationally for the first time at a concert in Los Angeles with organizational support from Sonic Youth and Redd Kross. The band&#x27;s cult following among musicians was illustrated by the 1991 tribute album &quot;Every Band Has a Shonen Knife Who Loves Them,&quot; with cover songs by 23 punk and alternative rock acts.

=== International recognition ===
The band released the album &quot;712&quot; in 1991. Shonen Knife received significant international recognition later that year when longtime fan Kurt Cobain invited them to open for Nirvana during a European tour, shortly before Nirvana gained widespread fame for their album &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Cobain praised Shonen Knife&#x27;s performances during the tour, stating, &quot;When I finally got to see them live, I was transformed into a hysterical nine-year-old girl at a Beatles concert.&quot; Shonen Knife admitted to not knowing who Nirvana was before the invitation, but acknowledged the friendliness and helpfulness of Cobain and the other members of the band during Shonen Knife&#x27;s first lengthy international tour. Naoko Yamano taught Cobain to play the Shonen Knife song &quot;Twist Barbie&quot;, and Nirvana covered the song several times during the tour. Cobain later listed Shonen Knife&#x27;s &quot;Burning Farm&quot; as one of his favorite albums.

Shonen Knife signed with Capitol Records in 1992 and released the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Knife&quot; in 1993, featuring re-recorded versions of many of their older songs with new English lyrics. The album &quot;Rock Animals&quot; was released internationally by Virgin Records in 1994, and the video for the song &quot;Tomato Head&quot; was featured on the American TV series &quot;Beavis &amp; Butthead&quot;. In 1994, Shonen Knife toured throughout the United States with the Lollapalooza festival. Later that year they contributed to the Carpenters tribute album &quot;If I Were A Carpenter.&quot; In the late 1990s, Shonen Knife lost their international record contract and their albums were only available as imports from Japan. The album &quot;Brand New Knife&quot; was released in 1997, followed by &quot;Happy Hour&quot; in 1998.

=== Line-up changes and early 21st century ===
Shonen Knife suffered its first lineup change in 1999, when Michie Nakatani left the band and retired from music. For the band&#x27;s next several albums, Atsuko Yamano played both drums and bass; for live performances she switched to bass and drummer Mana Nishiura was recruited for touring purposes. Nishiura did not perform on Shonen Knife&#x27;s studio albums and was not considered an official member because she continued to play with her full-time band DMBQ. The albums &quot;Strawberry Sound&quot; (2000), &quot;Heavy Songs&quot; (2002), &quot;Candy Rock&quot; (2003), and &quot;Genki Shock!&quot; (2006), were recorded as a duo with Naoko Yamano on guitar and vocals and Atsuko Yamano on bass and drums. Nishiura died in a car accident in 2005 while on tour with DMBQ. She was replaced by new full-time drummer Etsuko Nakanishi.

In late 2006, Atsuko Yamano left the band to get married and move to the United States. This left Naoko Yamano as the last remaining original member of the band. Atsuko was replaced by bassist Ritsuko Taneda, previously of the J-pop band Denki Candy. In the following years, Atsuko would occasionally play with the band during tours outside of Japan, at which time Taneda would switch to rhythm guitar; Atsuko did not play on the band&#x27;s studio albums during this period. The lineup of Naoko Yamano, Ritsuko Taneda, and Etsuko Nakanishi released the albums &quot;Super Group&quot; (2008) and &quot;Free Time&quot; (2010). In 2009 Shonen Knife signed with Damnably in the United Kingdom, and with Good Charamel in the United States at the invitation of label owner Robby Takac. Nakanishi left the band in 2010 and was replaced by Emi Morimoto. During this period they made a high-profile appearance at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in England, at the invitation of Matt Groening.

In 2011 Shonen Knife released the Ramones tribute album &quot;Osaka Ramones.&quot; This was followed by the original albums &quot;Pop Tune&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Overdrive&quot; in 2014. From April 2015 to May 2016 Taneda took a leave of absence from the band to give birth, and was temporarily replaced by bassist Naru Ishizuka. Also in 2015, Morimoto left the band and was replaced by 22 year-old drummer Risa Kawano, formerly of the band Brinky. During this period they made another appearance at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival.

In mid-2016, Taneda returned from maternity leave but did so on rhythm guitar, allowing Ishizuka to remain as the band&#x27;s bassist. This briefly made Shonen Knife&#x27;s official lineup a quartet for the first time. However, a short time later, founding member Atsuko Yamano re-joined the band as bassist after a ten-year absence, and the band was again reduced to a trio consisting of the Yamano sisters and Risa Kawano. Taneda and Ishizuka would make occasional guest appearances on the band&#x27;s next two albums. This incarnation of the band released the album &quot;Adventure,&quot; which was inspired by 1970s classic rock, in 2016 and the live album and video &quot;Alive! In Osaka&quot; the following year. &quot;Sweet Candy Power&quot; was released in 2019 and &quot;Our Best Place&quot; followed in 2023, promoted by the band&#x27;s first tour since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

<doc id="449749" wikidata="Q348916" url="?curid=449749" title="Bruce Chatwin">
<text>Charles Bruce Chatwin (13 May 194018 January 1989) was an English travel writer, novelist and journalist. His first book, &quot;In Patagonia&quot; (1977), established Chatwin as a travel writer, although he considered himself instead a storyteller, interested in bringing to light unusual tales. He won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his novel &quot;On the Black Hill&quot; (1982), while his novel &quot;Utz&quot; (1988) was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. In 2008 &quot;The Times&quot; ranked Chatwin as number 46 on their list of &quot;50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945&quot;.

Chatwin was born in Sheffield. After completing his secondary education at Marlborough College, he went to work at the age of 18 at Sotheby&#x27;s in London, where he gained an extensive knowledge of art and eventually ran the auction house&#x27;s Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. In 1966 he left Sotheby&#x27;s to read archaeology at the University of Edinburgh, but he abandoned his studies after two years to pursue a career as a writer.

&quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; hired Chatwin in 1972. He travelled the world for work and interviewed figures such as the politicians Indira Gandhi and André Malraux. He left the magazine in 1974 to visit Patagonia, Argentina, a trip that inspired his first book, &quot;In Patagonia&quot; (1977). He wrote five other books, including &quot;The Songlines&quot; (1987), about Australia, which was a bestseller. His work is credited with reviving the genre of travel writing, and his works influenced other writers such as William Dalrymple, Claudio Magris, Philip Marsden, Luis Sepúlveda, Rich Cohen, and Rory Stewart.

==Life==
===Early years===
Chatwin was born on 13 May 1940 at the Shearwood Road Nursing Home in Sheffield, England, to Charles Leslie Chatwin, a Birmingham solicitor and Royal Naval Reserve officer during World War II, and Margharita (née Turnell), daughter of a Sheffield knife manufacturer&#x27;s clerk. She was born in Sheffield and worked for the local Conservative party prior to her marriage. The Chatwin family were well known in Birmingham, with Charles Chatwin&#x27;s grandfather, Julius Alfred Chatwin, an eminent architect.

Chatwin&#x27;s early years were spent moving regularly with his mother while his father was at sea. Prior to his birth, Chatwin&#x27;s parents had lived at Barnt Green, Worcestershire, but Margharita moved to her parents&#x27; house in Dronfield, near Sheffield, shortly before giving birth. Mother and son remained there for a few weeks. Worried about The Blitz, Margharita sought a safer place to stay. She took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war. They would remain in one place until Margharita decided to move, either because of concern for their safety, or because of friction among family members. Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war, &quot;Home, if we had one, was a solid black suitcase called the Rev-Robe, in which there was a corner for my clothes and my Mickey Mouse gas mask.&quot;

One of their stays during the war was at the home of his paternal grandparents, who had a curiosity cabinet that fascinated him. Among the items it contained was a &quot;piece of brontosaurus&quot; (actually a mylodon, a giant sloth), which had been sent to Chatwin&#x27;s grandmother by her cousin Charles Milward. Travelling in Patagonia, Milward had discovered the remains of a giant sloth, which he later sold to the British Museum. He sent his cousin a piece of the animal&#x27;s skin, and members of the family mistakenly referred to it as a &quot;piece of brontosaurus&quot;. The skin was later lost, but it inspired Chatwin decades later to visit and write about Patagonia.

After the war, Chatwin lived with his parents and younger brother Hugh (19442012) in West Heath in Birmingham, where his father had a law practice. At the age of seven he was sent to boarding school at Old Hall School in Shropshire, and then Marlborough College, in Wiltshire. An unexceptional student, Chatwin garnered attention from his performances in school plays. While at Marlborough, Chatwin attained A-levels in Latin, Greek, and Ancient History.

Chatwin had hoped to read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, but the end of National Service in the United Kingdom meant there was more competition for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered: an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin&#x27;s father asked one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby&#x27;s. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.

===Art and archaeology===
In 1958, Chatwin moved to London to begin work as a porter in the Works of Art department at Sotheby&#x27;s. Chatwin was ill-suited for this job, which included dusting objects that had been kept in storage. Sotheby&#x27;s moved him to a junior cataloguer position, working in both the Antiquities and Impressionist Art departments. This position enabled him to develop his eye for art, and he quickly became known for his ability to discern forgeries. His work as a cataloguer also taught him to describe objects in a concise manner and required him to research these objects. Chatwin advanced to become Sotheby&#x27;s expert on Antiquities and Impressionist art and would later run both departments. Many of Chatwin&#x27;s colleagues thought he would eventually become chairman of the auction house.

During this period Chatwin travelled extensively for his job and also for adventure. Travel offered him a relief from the British class system, which he found stifling. An admirer of Robert Byron and his book, &quot;The Road to Oxiana&quot;, he travelled twice to Afghanistan. He also used these trips to visit markets and shops, where he would buy antiques that he would resell at a profit in order to supplement his income from Sotheby&#x27;s. He became friends with artists, art collectors and dealers. One friend, Howard Hodgkin, painted Chatwin in &quot;The Japanese Screen&quot; (1962). Chatwin said he was the &quot;acid green smear on the left.&quot;

Chatwin was ambivalent about his sexual orientation and had affairs with both men and women during this period of his life. One of his girlfriends, Elizabeth Chanler, an American and a descendant of John Jacob Astor, was a secretary at Sotheby&#x27;s. Chanler had earned a degree in history from Radcliffe College and worked at Sotheby&#x27;s New York offices for two years before transferring to their London office in 1961. Her love of travel and independent nature appealed to Chatwin.

In the mid-1960s Chatwin grew unhappy at Sotheby&#x27;s. There were various reasons for his disenchantment. Both women and men found Chatwin attractive, and Peter Wilson, then chairman of Sotheby&#x27;s, used this appeal to the auction house&#x27;s advantage when using Chatwin to try to persuade wealthy individuals to sell their art collections. Chatwin became increasingly uncomfortable with the situation. Later in life Chatwin also spoke of having become &quot;burnt out&quot; and said, &quot;In the end I felt I might just as well be working for a rather superior funeral parlour. One&#x27;s whole life seemed to be spent valuing for probate the apartment of somebody recently dead.&quot;

In late 1964 he began to suffer from problems with his sight, which he attributed to the close analysis of artwork entailed by his job. He consulted eye specialist Patrick Trevor-Roper, who diagnosed a latent squint and recommended that Chatwin take a six-month break from his work at Sotheby&#x27;s. Trevor-Roper had been involved in the design of an eye hospital in Addis Ababa, and suggested Chatwin visit East Africa. In February 1965, Chatwin left for Sudan. It was on this trip that Chatwin first encountered a nomadic tribe; their way of life intrigued him. &quot;My nomadic guide,&quot; he wrote, &quot;carried a sword, a purse and a pot of scented goat&#x27;s grease for anointing his hair. He made me feel overburdened and inadequate...&quot; Chatwin would remain fascinated by nomads for the rest of his life.

Chatwin returned to Sotheby&#x27;s, and to the surprise of his friends, proposed marriage to Elizabeth Chanler. They married on 21 August 1965. Chatwin was bisexual throughout their married life, a circumstance Elizabeth knew and accepted. Chatwin had hoped he would &quot;grow out of&quot; his homosexual behaviour and have a successful marriage like his parents. During their marriage, Chatwin had many affairs, mostly with men. Some who were aware of Chatwin&#x27;s affairs with men assumed the Chatwins had a chaste marriage, but according to Nicholas Shakespeare, the author&#x27;s biographer, this was not true. Both Chatwin and his wife had hoped to have children, but they remained childless.

In April 1966, at the age of 26, Chatwin was promoted to a director of Sotheby&#x27;s, a position to which he had aspired. To his disappointment, he was made a junior director and lacked voting rights on the board. This disappointment, along with boredom and increasing discomfort over potentially illegal side deals taking place at Sotheby&#x27;s, including the sale of objects from the Pitt-Rivers museum collection, led Chatwin to resign from his Sotheby&#x27;s post in June 1966.

Chatwin enrolled in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study Archaeology. He had regretted not attending Oxford and had been contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in Leningrad sparked his interest in the field of archaeology. Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year&#x27;s work, he found the rigour of academic archaeology tiresome, and he left after two years without taking a degree.

===&quot;The Nomadic Alternative&quot;===
Following his departure from Edinburgh, Chatwin decided to pursue a career as a writer, successfully pitching a book proposal on nomads to Tom Maschler, publisher at Jonathan Cape. Chatwin tentatively titled the book &quot;The Nomadic Alternative&quot; and sought to answer the question &quot;Why do men wander rather than stand still?&quot; Chatwin delivered the manuscript in 1972, and Maschler declined to publish it, calling it a &quot;chore to read&quot;.

Between 1969 and 1972, as he was working on &quot;The Nomadic Alternative&quot;, Chatwin travelled extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career. He co-curated an exhibit on &quot;Nomadic Art of the Asian Steppes,&quot; which opened at Asia House Gallery in New York City in 1970. He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi. Levi published his own book about it, &quot;The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan&quot; (1972). Chatwin contributed two articles on nomads to &quot;Vogue&quot; and another article to &quot;History Today&quot;.

In the early 1970s Chatwin had an affair with James Ivory, a film director. Ivory gives an account of this in his memoir, &quot;Solid Ivory&quot;. He pitched stories to him for possible films, which Ivory did not take seriously. In 1972 Chatwin tried his hand at film-making and travelled to Niger to make a documentary about nomads. The film was lost while Chatwin was trying to sell it to European television companies.

Chatwin also took photographs of his journeys and attempted to sell photographs from a trip to Mauritania to &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine.&quot; While &quot;The Times&quot; did not accept those photographs for publication, it did offer Chatwin a job.

===&quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; and &quot;In Patagonia&quot;===

In 1972, &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; hired Chatwin as an adviser on art and architecture. Initially his role was to suggest story ideas and put together features such as &quot;One Million Years of Art&quot;, which ran in several issues during the summer of 1973. His editor, Francis Wyndham, encouraged him to write, which allowed him to develop his narrative skills. Chatwin travelled on many international assignments, writing on such subjects as Algerian migrant workers and the Great Wall of China, and interviewing such diverse people as André Malraux, Maria Reiche, and Madeleine Vionnet.

In 1972, Chatwin interviewed the 93-year-old architect and designer Eileen Gray in her Paris salon, where he noticed a map she had painted of the area of South America called Patagonia. &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to go there,&quot; Chatwin told her. &quot;So have I,&quot; she replied, &quot;Go there for me.&quot;

Two years later, in November 1974, Chatwin flew out to Lima in Peru, and reached Patagonia, Argentina, a month later. He would later claim that he sent a telegram to Wyndham merely stating: &quot;Have gone to Patagonia.&quot; Actually, he sent a letter: &quot;I am doing a story there for myself, something I have always wanted to write up.&quot; This marked the end of Chatwin&#x27;s role as a regular writer for &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot;, although in subsequent years he contributed occasional pieces, including a profile of Indira Gandhi.

Chatwin spent six months in Patagonia, travelling around gathering stories of people who came from elsewhere and settled there. This trip resulted in the book &quot;In Patagonia&quot; (1977). He used his quest for his own &quot;piece of brontosaurus&quot; (the one from his grandparents&#x27; cabinet had been thrown away years earlier) to frame the story of his trip. Chatwin described &quot;In Patagonia&quot; as &quot;the narrative of an actual journey and a symbolic one... It is supposed to fall into the category or be a spoof of Wonder Voyage: the narrator goes to a far country in search of a strange animal: on his way he lands in strange situations, people or other books tell him strange stories which add up to form a message.&quot;

&quot;In Patagonia&quot; contains fifteen black and white photographs by Chatwin. According to Susannah Clapp, who edited the book, &quot;Rebecca West amused Chatwin by telling him that these were so good they rendered superfluous the entire text of the book.&quot;

This work established Chatwin&#x27;s reputation as a travel writer. One of his biographers, Nicholas Murray, called &quot;In Patagonia&quot; &quot;one of the most strikingly original post-war English travel books&quot; and said that it revitalised the genre of travel writing. However, residents in the region contradicted the account of events depicted in Chatwin&#x27;s book. It was the first time in his career, but not the last, that conversations and characters which Chatwin presented as fact were later alleged to be fiction.

For &quot;In Patagonia&quot; Chatwin received the Hawthornden Prize and the E. M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Graham Greene, Patrick Leigh Fermor, and Paul Theroux praised the book. As a result of the success of &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, Chatwin&#x27;s circle of friends expanded to include people like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Susan Sontag, and Jasper Johns.

===Ouidah and the Black Hill===
Upon his return from Patagonia, Chatwin discovered a change in leadership at &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot; and his retainer was discontinued. Chatwin intended his next project to be a biography of Francisco Félix de Sousa, a 19th-century slave trader born in Brazil, who became the Viceroy of Ouidah in Dahomey. Chatwin had first heard of de Sousa during a visit to Dahomey in 1972. He returned to the country, by then renamed the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin, in December 1976 to conduct research. In January 1977, during the 1977 Benin coup d&#x27;état attempt, Chatwin was accused of being a mercenary and detained for three days. Chatwin later wrote about this experience in &quot;A Coup – A Story&quot;, which was published in &quot;Granta&quot; and included in &quot;What Am I Doing Here?&quot; (1989).

Following his arrest and release, Chatwin left Benin and went to Brazil to continue his research on de Sousa. Frustrated by the lack of documented information on de Sousa, Chatwin chose instead to write a fictionalised biography of him, &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot;. This book was published in 1980, and Werner Herzog&#x27;s film &quot;Cobra Verde&quot; (1987) is based on it.

Although &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot; received good reviews, it did not sell well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book. In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer, Chatwin said he &quot;decided to write something about people who never went out.&quot; His next book, &quot;On the Black Hill&quot; (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all of their lives in a farmhouse on the Welsh borders. For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel, even though he considered his previous book, &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot;, a novel. It was made into a film in 1987.

In the late 1970s Chatwin spent an increasing amount of time in New York City. He continued to have affairs with men, but most of these affairs were short-lived. In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards, an Australian stockbroker. Richards introduced him to the gay nightclub scene in New York. During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed him. Chatwin is one of the few men Mapplethorpe photographed fully clothed. Chatwin later contributed the introduction to a book of Mapplethorpe&#x27;s photographs, &quot;Lady, Lisa Lyon&quot; (1983).

Although Elizabeth Chatwin had accepted her husband&#x27;s affairs, their relationship deteriorated in the late 1970s, and in 1980 she asked for a separation. By 1982 Chatwin&#x27;s affair with Richards had ended and he began another serious affair with Jasper Conran.

===&quot;The Songlines&quot;===

In 1983 Chatwin returned to the topic of nomads and decided to focus on Aboriginal Australians. He was influenced by the work of Ted Strehlow, the author of &quot;Songs of Central Australia&quot;. Strehlow had collected and recorded Aboriginal songs, but he became a controversial figure when, shortly before his death in 1978, he sold photographs of secret Aboriginal initiation ceremonies to a magazine.

Chatwin went to Australia to learn more about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be used as a metaphor to support his ideas about humans&#x27; need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled fully to understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin&#x27;s approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information, as he was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow&#x27;s work.
While in Australia, Chatwin, who had been experiencing some health problems, first read about AIDS, then known as the gay plague. It frightened him and compelled him to reconcile with his wife. The fear of AIDS also drove him to finish the book that became &quot;The Songlines&quot; (1987). His friend the novelist Salman Rushdie said, &quot;That book was an obsession too great for him... His illness did him a favour, got him free of it. Otherwise, he would have gone on writing it for ten years.&quot;

&quot;The Songlines&quot; features a narrator named Bruce whose biography is almost identical to Chatwin&#x27;s. The narrator spends time in Australia trying to learn about Aboriginal culture, specifically the songlines. As the book goes on, it becomes a reflection on what Chatwin stated was &quot;for me, the question of questions: the nature of human restlessness.&quot; Chatwin also hinted at his preoccupation over his own mortality in the text: &quot;I had a presentiment that the &#x27;travelling&#x27; phase of my life might be passing... I should set down on paper a resume of the ideas, quotations, and encounters that amused me and obsessed me.&quot; Following this statement in &quot;The Songlines&quot; Chatwin included extensive excerpts from his moleskine notebooks.

Chatwin published &quot;The Songlines&quot; in 1987, and it became a bestseller in the United Kingdom and in the United States. The book was nominated for the Thomas Cook Travel Award, but Chatwin requested that it be withdrawn from consideration, saying the work was fictional. After its publication, Chatwin befriended the composer Kevin Volans, who was inspired to base a theatre score on the book. The project evolved into an opera, &quot;The Man with Footsoles of Wind&quot; (1993).

===Illness and final works===
While at work on &quot;The Songlines&quot; between 1983 and 1986, Chatwin frequently came down with colds. He also developed skin lesions that may have been symptoms of Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma. After finishing &quot;The Songlines&quot; in August 1986, he went to Switzerland, where he collapsed in the street. At a clinic there, he was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Chatwin provided different reasons to his doctors as to how he might have contracted HIV, including from a gang rape in Dahomey or possibly from Sam Wagstaff, the patron and lover of Robert Mapplethorpe.

Chatwin&#x27;s case was unusual as he had a fungal infection, &quot;Talaromyces marneffei&quot;, which at the time had rarely been seen and only in South Asia. It is now known as an AIDS-defining illness, but in 1986 little was known about HIV and AIDS. Doctors were not certain if all cases of HIV developed into AIDS. The rare fungus gave Chatwin hope that he might be different and served as the basis of what he told most people about his illness. He gave various reasons for how he became infected with the fungus – ranging from eating a thousand-year-old egg to exploring a bat cave in Indonesia. He never publicly disclosed that he was HIV-positive because of the stigma. He wanted to protect his parents, who were unaware of his homosexual affairs.

Although Chatwin never spoke or wrote publicly about his disease, in one instance he did write about the AIDS epidemic in 1988 in a letter to the editor of the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;,

 &quot;The word &#x27;Aids&#x27; is one of the cruellest and silliest neologisms of our time. &#x27;Aid&#x27; means help, succour, comfort—yet with a hissing sibilant tacked onto the end it becomes a nightmare... HIV (Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus) is a perfectly easy name to live with. &#x27;Aids&#x27; causes panic and despair and has probably done something to facilitate the spread of the disease.&quot; 

During his illness, Chatwin continued to write. Elizabeth encouraged him to use a letter he had written to her from Prague in 1967 as an inspiration for a new story. During this trip, he had met Konrad Just, an art collector. This meeting and the letter to Elizabeth served as the basis for Chatwin&#x27;s next work. &quot;Utz&quot; (1988) was a novel about the obsession that leads people to collect. Set in Prague, the novel details the life and death of Kaspar Utz, a man obsessed with his collection of Meissen porcelain. &quot;Utz&quot; was well-received and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

Chatwin also edited a collection of his journalism, which was published as &quot;What Am I Doing Here&quot; (1989). At the time of his death in 1989, he was working on a number of new ideas for novels, including a transcontinental epic provisionally titled &quot;Lydia Livingstone&quot;.

Chatwin died at a hospital in Nice on 18 January 1989. A memorial service was held at the Greek Orthodox Church of Saint Sophia in West London on 14 February 1989; Salman Rushdie, a close friend of Chatwin&#x27;s, attended the service. Paul Theroux, who also attended the service, later commented on it and Chatwin in a piece for &quot;Granta&quot;. The novelist Martin Amis described the memorial service in the essay &quot;Salman Rushdie&quot;, included in his anthology &quot;Visiting Mrs Nabokov&quot;.

In 1985, suffering from a mysterious illness (which turned out to be HIV) Chatwin interrupted his writing to make a pilgrimage to Mount Athos. Until that point he had never struck friends as being religious, but the visit had a profound effect, and he eventually decided to become an Orthodox Christian. At the memorial service Bishop Kallistos Ware told the congregation: &#x27;Bruce was always a traveller and he died before all his journeys could be completed… his journey into Orthodoxy was one of his unfinished voyages.&#x27;

Chatwin&#x27;s ashes were scattered near a Byzantine chapel above Kardamyli in the Peloponnese. This was close to the home of one of his mentors, the writer Patrick Leigh Fermor. Chatwin had spent several months in 1985 near there, working on &quot;The Songlines&quot;.

Chatwin&#x27;s papers, including 85 moleskine notebooks, were given to the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Two collections of his photographs and excerpts from the moleskine notebooks were published as &quot;Photographs and Notebooks&quot; (US title: &quot;Far Journeys&quot;) in 1993 and &quot;Winding Paths&quot; in 1999.

News of Chatwin&#x27;s AIDS diagnosis first surfaced in September 1988, although the obituaries at the time of his death had referred to Chatwin&#x27;s statements about a rare fungal infection. After his death, some members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lack of courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, thinking he would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Britain known to have contracted HIV.

==Writing style==
John Updike described Chatwin&#x27;s writing as &quot;a clipped, lapidary prose that compresses worlds into pages&quot;, while one of Chatwin&#x27;s editors, Susannah Clapp, wrote, &quot;Although his syntax was pared down, his words were not – or at least not only – plain... His prose is both spare and flamboyant.&quot;
Chatwin&#x27;s writing was shaped by his work as a cataloguer at Sotheby&#x27;s, which provided him with years of practice in writing concise, yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, his writing was influenced by his interest in nomads. One aspect that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their Spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and he sought to emulate it in his life and his writing, striving to strip needless objects from his life and needless words from his prose.

Chatwin experimented with format in his writing. With &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, Clapp said Chatwin described the book&#x27;s structure of 97 vignettes as &quot;Cubist&quot;. &quot;[I]n other words,&quot; she said, &quot;lots of small pictures tilting away and toward each other to create this strange original portrait of Patagonia.&quot; &quot;The Songlines&quot; was another attempt by Chatwin to experiment with format. It begins as a novel narrated by a man named Bruce, but about two-thirds of the way through it becomes a commonplace book filled with quotations, anecdotes, and summaries of others&#x27; research, in an attempt to explore restlessness. Some of Chatwin&#x27;s critics did not think he succeeded in &quot;The Songlines&quot; with this approach, but others applauded his effort at an unconventional structure.

Several 19th and 20th-century writers influenced Chatwin&#x27;s work. He admitted to imitating the work of Robert Byron when he first began making notes of his travels. While in Patagonia he read &quot;In Our Time&quot; by Ernest Hemingway, whom he admired for his spare prose. While writing &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, Chatwin strove to approach his writing as a &quot;literary Cartier-Bresson&quot;. Chatwin&#x27;s biographer described the resulting prose as &quot;quick snapshots of ordinary people&quot;. Along with Hemingway and Cartier-Bresson, Osip Mandelstam&#x27;s work strongly influenced Chatwin during the writing of &quot;In Patagonia&quot;. An admirer of Noël Coward, Chatwin found the breakfast scene in &quot;Private Lives&quot; helpful in learning to write dialogue. Once Chatwin began work on &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot;, he began studying the work of 19th-century French authors such as Honoré de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert, who would continue to influence him for the rest of his life.

==Themes==
Chatwin explored several different themes in his work: human restlessness and wandering; borders and exile; and art and objects.

He considered human restlessness to be the focus of his writing. He ultimately aspired to explore the subject in order to answer what he saw as a fundamental question of human existence. He thought humans were meant to be a migratory species, and once they settled in one place, their natural urges &quot;found outlets in violence, greed, status-seeking or a mania for the new.&quot; In his first attempt at writing a book, &quot;The Nomadic Alternative&quot;, Chatwin had tried to compose an academic exposition on nomadic culture, which he believed was unexamined and unappreciated. With this, Chatwin had hoped to discover: &quot;Why do men wander rather than sit still?&quot; In his book proposal he admitted that the interest in the subject was personal: &quot;Why do I become restless after a month in a single place, unbearable after two?&quot;

Although Chatwin did not succeed with &quot;The Nomadic Alternative&quot;, he returned to the topic of restlessness and wandering in subsequent books. Writer Jonathan Chatwin (no relation) stated that Chatwin&#x27;s works can be grouped into two categories: &quot;restlessness defined&quot; and &quot;restlessness explained.&quot; Most of his work focuses on describing restlessness, such as in the case of one twin in &quot;On the Black Hill&quot; who longs to leave home. Another example is the protagonist of &quot;Utz&quot;, who feels restless to escape to Vichy each year, but always returns to Prague. Chatwin attempted to explain restlessness in &quot;The Songlines&quot;, which focused on the Aboriginal Australians&#x27; walkabout. For this, he returned to his research from &quot;The Nomadic Alternative&quot;.

Borders are another Chatwin theme. According to Elizabeth Chatwin, he &quot;was interested in borders, where things were always changing, not one thing or another.&quot; Patagonia, the subject of his first published book, is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile. The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey. &quot;On the Black Hills&quot; takes place on the borders of Wales and England. In &quot;The Songlines&quot; the characters the protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between the Aboriginal and white Australian worlds. The main character in &quot;Utz&quot; travels back and forth across the Iron Curtain.

&quot;The theme of exile, of people living at the margins... is treated in a literal and metaphorical sense throughout Chatwin&#x27;s work,&quot; stated Nicholas Murray. He identified several examples. There were people who were actual exiles, like some of those profiled in &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, and the Viceroy of Ouidah, unable to return to Brazil. Murray also cited the main characters in &quot;On the Black Hill&quot;: &quot;Although not strictly exiles... [they] were exiles from the major events of their time and its dominant values.&quot; Similarly, Murray wrote, Utz is &quot;trapped in a society whose values are not his own but which he cannot bring himself to leave.&quot;

Chatwin returned to the subject of art and objects during his career. In his early writing for the &quot;Sunday Times Magazine&quot;, he wrote about art and artists, and many of these articles were included in &quot;What Am I Doing Here&quot;. The main focus of &quot;Utz&quot; is on the impact the possession of art (in this case porcelain figures) has on a collector. Utz&#x27;s unwillingness to give up his porcelain collection kept him in Czechoslovakia even though he had the opportunity to live in the West. Chatwin constantly struggled with the conflicting desires to own beautiful items and to live in a space free of unnecessary objects. His distaste for the art world resulted from his days at Sotheby&#x27;s; some of his final writing focused on this. The topic appears in the final section of &quot;What Am I Doing Here&quot;, &quot;Tales from the Art World&quot;, which consists of four short stories. At the end of &quot;What Am I Doing Here&quot;, Chatwin shares an anecdote of advice he received from Noël Coward: &quot;Never let anything artistic stand in your way.&quot; Chatwin stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve always acted on that advice.&quot;

==Influence==
With the publication of &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, Chatwin invigorated the genre of travel writing; according to his biographer, Nicholas Murray, he &quot;showed that an inventive writer could breathe new life into an old genre.&quot; The combination of his clear, yet vivid prose and an international perspective at a time when many English writers were more focused on home instead of abroad helped to set him apart. Aside from his writing, Chatwin was also good looking, and his image as a dashing traveller added to his appeal and helped make him a celebrity. In the eyes of younger writers such as Rory Stewart, Chatwin &quot;made [travel writing] cool.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Andrew Harvey wrote, 
&quot;Nearly every writer of my generation in England has wanted, at some point, to be Bruce Chatwin; wanted, like him, to talk of Fez and Firdausi, Nigeria and Nuristan, with equal authority; wanted to be talked about, as he is, with raucous envy; wanted above all to have written his books.&quot;

Chatwin&#x27;s books also inspired some readers to visit Patagonia and Australia. As a result, Patagonia experienced an increase in tourism, and it became a common sight for tourists to appear in the region, carrying a copy of &quot;In Patagonia&quot;. &quot;The Songlines&quot; also inspired readers to travel to Australia and seek out the people on whom Chatwin had based his characters, much to their consternation, as he had failed to disclose such intentions to them.

Beyond travel, Chatwin influenced other writers, such as Claudio Magris, Luis Sepúlveda, Philip Marsden, and William Dalrymple. Nicholas Shakespeare stated that some of Chatwin&#x27;s impact came from the difficulty of categorising his work, which helped to &quot;set free other writers...[from] conventional boundaries.&quot; Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify himself as one, or as a novelist. (&quot;I don&#x27;t quite know the meaning of the word novel,&quot; he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, &quot;He posed questions we all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable.&quot;

===Posthumous influence===
According to his biographer Nicholas Shakespeare, Chatwin&#x27;s work developed a dedicated following in the years immediately after his death. By 1998 a million copies of his books had been sold. However, his reputation diminished following revelations about his personal life and questions about the accuracy of his work.

The accuracy problem had arisen before his death, and Chatwin had admitted to &quot;counting up the lies&quot; in &quot;In Patagonia&quot;, though he stated there were not many. While researching Chatwin&#x27;s life, Nicholas Shakespeare stated he found &quot;few cases of mere invention&quot; in &quot;In Patagonia&quot;. Mostly, these tended to be instances of embellishment, such as when Chatwin wrote of a nurse who loved the work of Osip Mandelstam – one of his favorite authors – when in fact she was a fan of Agatha Christie. When Michael Ignatieff asked Chatwin his opinion of what divided fact from fiction, he replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is [a division].&quot;

Some individuals profiled in &quot;In Patagonia&quot; were unhappy with Chatwin&#x27;s portrayals of them. They included a man whom Chatwin insinuated was homosexual and a woman who thought her father was unjustly accused of killing Indians. However, Chatwin&#x27;s biographer found one farmer who was featured in the book who thought Chatwin&#x27;s depictions of himself and other members of his community were truthful. He stated, &quot;No one likes looking at their own passport photograph, but I found it accurate. It&#x27;s not flattering, but it&#x27;s the truth.&quot;

Chatwin&#x27;s bestseller, &quot;The Songlines&quot;, has been the focus of much criticism. Some describe his viewpoint as &quot;colonialist&quot;, citing his lack of interviews with Aboriginals and reliance instead on white Australians for information about Aboriginal culture. Other criticism comes from anthropologists and other researchers who spent years studying Aboriginal culture and dismiss Chatwin&#x27;s work because he visited Australia briefly. Yet others, such as writer Thomas Keneally, believe &quot;The Songlines&quot; should be widely read in Australia, where many people had not previously heard of the songlines.

The questions about the veracity of Chatwin&#x27;s writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as a liar and dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, &quot;His denial [of his AIDS diagnosis] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them.&quot; In 2010 &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; review of &quot;Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin&quot; opened with the question, &quot;Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?&quot; However, Rory Stewart has stated, &quot;His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [than they once were]. And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance&quot;. In 2008 &quot;The Times&quot; rated Chatwin No. 46 on their list of &quot;50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945&quot;.

===Legacy===
Chatwin&#x27;s name is used to sell Moleskine notebooks. Chatwin wrote in &quot;The Songlines&quot; of little black oilskin-covered notebooks that he bought in Paris and called &quot;moleskines&quot;. The quotes and anecdotes he had compiled in them serve as a major section of &quot;The Songlines&quot;, where Chatwin mourned the closure of the last producer of such books. In 1995, Marta Sebregondi read &quot;The Songlines&quot; and proposed to her employer, the Italian design and publishing firm Modo &amp; Modo, that they produce moleskine notebooks. In 1997, the company began to sell them and use Chatwin&#x27;s name to promote them. Modo &amp; Modo was sold in 2006, and the company became known as Moleskine SpA.

In 2014 the clothing label Burberry produced a collection inspired by Chatwin&#x27;s books. The following year Burberry released a limited edition of Chatwin&#x27;s books with specially designed covers.

In September 2019 the documentary film &quot;&quot;, by Werner Herzog, was broadcast by the BBC.

<text>Epitaxy (prefix &quot;epi-&quot; means &quot;on top of”) refers to a type of crystal growth or material deposition in which new crystalline layers are formed with one or more well-defined orientations with respect to the crystalline seed layer. The deposited crystalline film is called an epitaxial film or epitaxial layer. The relative orientation(s) of the epitaxial layer to the seed layer is defined in terms of the orientation of the crystal lattice of each material. For most epitaxial growths, the new layer is usually crystalline and each crystallographic domain of the overlayer must have a well-defined orientation relative to the substrate crystal structure. Epitaxy can involve single-crystal structures, although grain-to-grain epitaxy has been observed in granular films. For most technological applications, single-domain epitaxy, which is the growth of an overlayer crystal with one well-defined orientation with respect to the substrate crystal, is preferred. Epitaxy can also play an important role in the growth of superlattice structures.

The term &quot;epitaxy&quot; comes from the Greek roots &quot;epi&quot; (ἐπί), meaning &quot;above&quot;, and &quot;taxis&quot; (τάξις), meaning &quot;an ordered manner&quot;.

One of the main commercial applications of epitaxial growth is in the semiconductor industry, where semiconductor films are grown epitaxially on semiconductor substrate wafers. For the case of epitaxial growth of a planar film atop a substrate wafer, the epitaxial film&#x27;s lattice will have a specific orientation relative to the substrate wafer&#x27;s crystalline lattice, such as the [001] Miller index of the film aligning with the [001] index of the substrate. In the simplest case, the epitaxial layer can be a continuation of the same semiconductor compound as the substrate; this is referred to as homoepitaxy. Otherwise, the epitaxial layer will be composed of a different compound; this is referred to as heteroepitaxy.

==Types==
Homoepitaxy is a kind of epitaxy performed with only one material, in which a crystalline film is grown on a substrate or film of the same material. This technology is often used to grow a more pure film than the substrate and to fabricate layers with different doping levels. In academic literature, homoepitaxy is often abbreviated to &quot;homoepi&quot;.

Homotopotaxy is a process similar to homoepitaxy except that the thin-film growth is not limited to two-dimensional growth. Here the substrate is the thin-film material.

Heteroepitaxy is a kind of epitaxy performed with materials that are different from each other. In heteroepitaxy, a crystalline film grows on a crystalline substrate or film of a different material. This technology is often used to grow crystalline films of materials for which crystals cannot otherwise be obtained and to fabricate integrated crystalline layers of different materials. Examples include silicon on sapphire, gallium nitride (GaN) on sapphire, aluminium gallium indium phosphide (AlGaInP) on gallium arsenide (GaAs) or diamond or iridium, and graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN).

Heteroepitaxy occurs when a film of different composition and/or crystalline films grown on a substrate. In this case, the amount of strain in the film is determined by the &quot;lattice mismatch&quot; Ԑ:

formula_1

Where formula_2 and formula_3 are the lattice constants of the film and the substrate. The film and substrate could have similar lattice spacings but also different thermal expansion coefficients. If a film is grown at a high temperature, it can experience large strains upon cooling to room temperature. In reality, formula_4 is necessary for obtaining epitaxy. If formula_5 is larger than that, the film experiences a volumetric strain that builds with each layer until a critical thickness. With increased thickness, the elastic strain in the film is relieved by the formation of dislocations, which can become scattering centers that damage the quality of the structure. Heteroepitaxy is commonly used to create so-called bandgap systems thanks to the additional energy caused by de deformation. Silicon-germanium epitaxial layers are heavily used in CMOS microelectronics and silicon photonics.

Heterotopotaxy is a process similar to heteroepitaxy except that thin-film growth is not limited to two-dimensional growth; the substrate is similar only in structure to the thin-film material.

Pendeo-epitaxy is a process in which the heteroepitaxial film is growing vertically and laterally simultaneously.
In 2D crystal heterostructure, graphene nanoribbons embedded in hexagonal boron nitride give an example of pendeo-epitaxy.

Grain-to-grain epitaxy involves epitaxial growth between the grains of a multicrystalline epitaxial and seed layer. This can usually occur when the seed layer only has an out-of-plane texture but no in-plane texture. In such a case, the seed layer consists of grains with different in-plane textures. The epitaxial overlayer then creates specific textures along each grain of the seed layer, due to lattice matching. This kind of epitaxial growth doesn&#x27;t involve single-crystal films.

Epitaxy is used in silicon-based manufacturing processes for bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and modern complementary metal–oxide–semiconductors (CMOS), but it is particularly important for compound semiconductors such as gallium arsenide. Manufacturing issues include control of the amount and uniformity of the deposition&#x27;s resistivity and thickness, the cleanliness and purity of the surface and the chamber atmosphere, the prevention of the typically much more highly doped substrate wafer&#x27;s diffusion of dopant to the new layers, imperfections of the growth process, and protecting the surfaces during manufacture and handling.

==Mechanism==
Heteroepitaxial growth is classified into three primary growth modes-- Volmer–Weber (VW), Frank–van der Merwe (FM) and Stranski–Krastanov (SK).

In the VW growth regime, the epitaxial film grows out of 3D nuclei on the growth surface. In this mode, the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are stronger than adsorbate-surface interactions, leading to island formation by local nucleation and the epitaxial layer is formed when the islands join.

In the FM growth mode, adsorbate-surface and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are balanced, which promotes 2D layer-by-layer or step-flow epitaxial growth.

The SK mode is a combination of VW and FM modes. In this mechanism, the growth initiates in the FM mode, forming 2D layers, but after reaching a critical thickness, enters a VW-like 3D island growth regime.

Practical epitaxial growth, however, takes place in a high supersaturation regime, away from thermodynamic equilibrium. In that case, the epitaxial growth is governed by adatom kinetics rather than thermodynamics, and 2D step-flow growth becomes dominant.

==Methods==
===Vapor-phase===

Homoepitaxial growth of semiconductor thin films are generally done by chemical or physical vapor deposition methods that deliver the precursors to the substrate in gaseous state. For example, silicon is most commonly deposited from silicon tetrachloride (or germanium tetrachloride) and hydrogen at approximately 1200 to 1250 °C:
:SiCl4(g) + 2H2(g) ↔ Si(s) + 4HCl(g)

where (g) and (s) represent gas and solid phases, respectively. This reaction is reversible, and the growth rate depends strongly upon the proportion of the two source gases. Growth rates above 2 micrometres per minute produce polycrystalline silicon, and negative growth rates (etching) may occur if too much hydrogen chloride byproduct is present. (Hydrogen chloride may be intentionally added to etch the wafer.) An additional etching reaction competes with the deposition reaction:
:SiCl4(g) + Si(s) ↔ 2SiCl2(g)

Silicon VPE may also use silane, dichlorosilane, and trichlorosilane source gases. For instance, the silane reaction occurs at 650 °C in this way:
:SiH4 → Si + 2H2

VPE is sometimes classified by the chemistry of the source gases, such as hydride VPE (HVPE) and metalorganic VPE (MOVPE or MOCVD).

The reaction chamber where this process takes place may be heated by lamps located outside the chamber. A common technique used in compound semiconductor growth is molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). In this method, a source material is heated to produce an evaporated beam of particles, which travel through a very high vacuum (10−8 Pa; practically free space) to the substrate and start epitaxial growth. Chemical beam epitaxy, on the other hand, is an ultra-high vacuum process that uses gas phase precursors to generate the molecular beam.

Another widely used technique in microelectronics and nanotechnology is atomic layer epitaxy, in which precursor gases are alternatively pulsed into a chamber, leading to atomic monolayer growth by surface saturation and chemisorption.

===Liquid-phase===
Liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) is a method to grow semiconductor crystal layers from the melt on solid substrates. This happens at temperatures well below the melting point of the deposited semiconductor. The semiconductor is dissolved in the melt of another material. At conditions that are close to the equilibrium between dissolution and deposition, the deposition of the semiconductor crystal on the substrate is relatively fast and uniform. The most used substrate is indium phosphide (InP). Other substrates like glass or ceramic can be applied for special applications. To facilitate nucleation, and to avoid tension in the grown layer the thermal expansion coefficient of substrate and grown layer should be similar.

Centrifugal liquid-phase epitaxy is used commercially to make thin layers of silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide. Centrifugally formed film growth is a process used to form thin layers of materials by using a centrifuge. The process has been used to create silicon for thin-film solar cells and far-infrared photodetectors. Temperature and centrifuge spin rate are used to control layer growth. Centrifugal LPE has the capability to create dopant concentration gradients while the solution is held at constant temperature.

===Solid-phase===
Solid-phase epitaxy (SPE) is a transition between the amorphous and crystalline phases of a material. It is usually produced by depositing a film of amorphous material on a crystalline substrate, then heating it to crystallize the film. The single-crystal substrate serves as a template for crystal growth. The annealing step used to recrystallize or heal silicon layers amorphized during ion implantation is also considered to be a type of solid phase epitaxy. The impurity segregation and redistribution at the growing crystal-amorphous layer interface during this process is used to incorporate low-solubility dopants in metals and silicon.

==Doping==
An epitaxial layer can be doped during deposition by adding impurities to the source gas, such as arsine, phosphine, or diborane. Dopants in the source gas, liberated by evaporation or wet etching of the surface, may also diffuse into the epitaxial layer and cause &quot;autodoping&quot;. The concentration of impurity in the gas phase determines its concentration in the deposited film. Doping can also be achieved by a site-competition technique, where the growth precursor ratios are tuned to enhance the incorporation of vacancies, specific dopant species or vacant-dopant clusters into the lattice. Additionally, the high temperatures at which epitaxy is performed may allow dopants to diffuse into the growing layer from other layers in the wafer (&quot;out-diffusion&quot;).

==Minerals==
In mineralogy, epitaxy is the overgrowth of one mineral on another in an orderly way, such that certain crystal directions of the two minerals are aligned. This occurs when some planes in the lattices of the overgrowth and the substrate have similar spacings between atoms.

If the crystals of both minerals are well formed so that the directions of the crystallographic axes are clear then the epitaxic relationship can be deduced just by a visual inspection.

Sometimes many separate crystals form the overgrowth on a single substrate, and then if there is epitaxy all the overgrowth crystals will have a similar orientation. The reverse, however, is not necessarily true. If the overgrowth crystals have a similar orientation there is probably an epitaxic relationship, but it is not certain.

Some authors consider that overgrowths of a second generation of the same mineral species should also be considered as epitaxy, and this is common terminology for semiconductor scientists who induce epitaxic growth of a film with a different doping level on a semiconductor substrate of the same material. For naturally produced minerals, however, the International Mineralogical Association (IMA) definition requires that the two minerals be of different species.

Another man-made application of epitaxy is the making of artificial snow using silver iodide, which is possible because hexagonal silver iodide and ice have similar cell dimensions.

===Isomorphic minerals===
Minerals that have the same structure (isomorphic minerals) may have epitaxic relations. An example is albite on microcline . Both these minerals are triclinic, with space group , and with similar unit cell parameters, a = 8.16 Å, b = 12.87 Å, c = 7.11 Å, α = 93.45°, β = 116.4°, γ = 90.28° for albite and a = 8.5784 Å, b = 12.96 Å, c = 7.2112 Å, α = 90.3°, β = 116.05°, γ = 89° for microcline.

===Polymorphic minerals===
Minerals that have the same composition but different structures (polymorphic minerals) may also have epitaxic relations. Examples are pyrite and marcasite, both FeS2, and sphalerite and wurtzite, both ZnS.

===Rutile on hematite===
Some pairs of minerals that are not related structurally or compositionally may also exhibit epitaxy. A common example is rutile TiO2 on hematite Fe2O3. Rutile is tetragonal and hematite is trigonal, but there are directions of similar spacing between the atoms in the (100) plane of rutile (perpendicular to the a axis) and the (001) plane of hematite (perpendicular to the c axis). In epitaxy these directions tend to line up with each other, resulting in the axis of the rutile overgrowth being parallel to the c axis of hematite, and the c axis of rutile being parallel to one of the axes of hematite.

===Hematite on magnetite===
Another example is hematite on magnetite . The magnetite structure is based on close-packed oxygen anions stacked in an ABC-ABC sequence. In this packing the close-packed layers are parallel to (111) (a plane that symmetrically &quot;cuts off&quot; a corner of a cube). The hematite structure is based on close-packed oxygen anions stacked in an AB-AB sequence, which results in a crystal with hexagonal symmetry.

If the cations were small enough to fit into a truly close-packed structure of oxygen anions then the spacing between the nearest neighbour oxygen sites would be the same for both species. The radius of the oxygen ion, however, is only 1.36 Å and the Fe cations are big enough to cause some variations. The Fe radii vary from 0.49 Å to 0.92 Å, depending on the charge (2+ or 3+) and the coordination number (4 or 8). Nevertheless, the O spacings are similar for the two minerals hence hematite can readily grow on the (111) faces of magnetite, with hematite (001) parallel to magnetite (111).

==Applications==
Epitaxy is used in nanotechnology and in semiconductor fabrication. Indeed, epitaxy is the only affordable method of high quality crystal growth for many semiconductor materials. In surface science, epitaxy is used to create and study monolayer and multilayer films of adsorbed organic molecules on single crystalline surfaces via scanning tunnelling microscopy.

<text>The Paris Observatory (, ), a research institution of the Paris Sciences et Lettres University, is the foremost astronomical observatory of France, and one of the largest astronomical centres in the world. Its historic building is on the Left Bank of the Seine in central Paris, but most of the staff work on a satellite campus in Meudon, a suburb southwest of Paris.

The Paris Observatory was founded in 1667.Construction was completed by the early 1670s and coincided with a major push for increased science, and the founding of the Royal Academy of Sciences. King Louis XIV&#x27;s minister of finance organized a &quot;scientific powerhouse&quot; to increase understanding of astronomy, maritime navigation, and science in general.

Through the centuries the Paris Observatory has continued in support of astronomical activities, and in the 21st century connects multiple sites and organizations, supporting astronomy and science, past and present. 

==Constitution==

Administratively, it is a &quot;grand établissement&quot; of the French Ministry of National Education, with a status close to that of a public university. Its missions include:
* Research in astronomy and astrophysics
* Education (four graduate programs, Ph.D. studies)
* Diffusion of knowledge to the public

It maintains a solar observatory at Meudon and a radio astronomy observatory at Nançay. It was also the home to the International Time Bureau until its dissolution in 1987. It remains the source of legal time in France, using multiple atomic fountain clocks maintained by its SYRTE () department. The Paris Observatory Library, which was founded in 1785, provides the researchers with documentation and preserves the ancient books, archives, and heritage collections of the institution. Many collections are available online.

==History==
The Paris Observatory was proposed in 1665–1666 by the French Academy of Sciences, which had recently been founded by the Minister of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert. In 1666, King Louis XIV authorized the building of the Observatory. On Midsummer&#x27;s Day 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building&#x27;s outline on a plot outside town near the Port Royal abbey, with the Paris meridian exactly bisecting the site north–south. The meridian line was used as a basis for navigation and would be used by French cartographers as their prime meridian for more than 200 years.

The Paris Observatory predates by a few years the Royal Greenwich Observatory in England, which was founded in 1675. The English philosopher John Locke visited the Paris Observatory on 28 August 1677, which he recorded in his journal: &quot;At the Observatory we saw the Moon in a twenty-two foot glass, and Jupiter, with his satellites, in the same. The most remote was on the east, and the other three on the west. We also saw Saturn and his ring, in a twelve-foot glass, and one of his satellites. Monsieur Cassini told me, that the declination of the needle at Paris is about two and a half degrees to the west.&quot;

The architect of the Paris Observatory was Claude Perrault whose brother, Charles, was secretary to Jean-Baptiste Colbert and superintendent of public works. Optical instruments were supplied by Giuseppe Campani. Construction of the Observatory was completed in 1671, though the buildings were extended in 1730, 1810, 1834, 1850, and 1951. The last extension incorporates the Meridian Room designed by Jean Prouvé.


===Accomplishments===
In 1671 Saturn&#x27;s moon Iapetus was discovered from the observatory, followed by Rhea in 1672. The moons Dione and Tethys were also discovered from the observatory in 1684.

In 1676 the staff concluded that light itself was travelling at a finite speed.
The world&#x27;s first national almanac, the &quot;Connaissance des temps,&quot; was published by the Observatory in 1679, using eclipses in Jupiter&#x27;s satellites to aid sea-farers in establishing longitude. In 1863, the observatory published the first modern weather maps. In 1882, a astrographic lens was constructed, an instrument that catalysed what proved to be the over-ambitious international &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; project.

In November 1913, the observatory used the Eiffel Tower as an antenna, exchanged sustained radio signals with the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. to determine the exact difference of longitude between the two institutions.

=== Heritage ===
The Paris Observatory library preserves a great number of original works and letters of the Observatory and well known astronomers. The entire collection has been inventoried in an online archive called Calames. Some of the work is now digitized on the digital library such as those of Johannes Hevelius, Jérôme Lalande and Joseph-Nicolas Delisle.

==Directors and staff==
The title of Director of the Observatory was officially given for the first time to César-François Cassini de Thury by a Royal brevet dated November 12, 1771. However, the important role played by his grandfather and father in this institution during its first century actually gave them somewhat the role of Director.

The observatory did not have a recognised Director until 1771, before that each member could do as they pleased. Sometimes Giovanni Cassini (1671–1712) and Jacques Cassini (1712–1756) are listed as &quot;Directors&quot; retrospectively. The same goes for François Arago, who also was not actually a Director although he did have a &quot;de facto&quot; position of leadership and is often credited as such.

The current President of the Observatory is Fabienne Casoli.

== Facilities ==

The first site was the Paris headquarters established in 1667 by King Louis XIV of France. This facility had various work done on it over the centuries, and in 1927 the Meudon Observatory was added, which included a new site and facilities. It was built in 1891.

In addition to these sites, the Marseilles Observatory became a branch of the Paris Observatory in 1863. In 1873, Marseilles Observatory detached from Paris Observatory.

=== Paris ===

King Louis XIV purchased the land for his new observatory in March 1667. This provided a site for the activities of the Academy of Sciences near to the city of Paris. The original buildings was designed by Claude Perrault. A dome and terrace was added in 1847.
=== Meudon ===

The Meudon site was constructed in the late 19th century by Jules Janssen, one of the discoverers of helium. With a million francs and permission to build on the ruins of the old royal palace, he constructed one of the grandest observatories of its day, with a focus on astronomy and solar physics. After World War I, the observatory was integrated with the nearby Paris Observatory and became an important campus for that observatory. Even into the 21st century solar observations are conducted at the Meudon site, and the preserved Great Refractor (Grande lunette) and astronomical gardens overlooking the city of Paris have delighted visitors for decades. The site includes:
* Solar Observatory Tower Meudon
* Chateau de Meudon
* LESIA space and astrophysics instrumentation research laboratory

=== Nançay ===

After the Second World War, French astronomers began designing and building instruments for radio astronomy. A field station was established in 1953, and by the late 1950s several radio instruments were established.
In 1965 the Nançay radio telescope was established, a design equivalent to an almost 100-metre dish.

=== Saint-Véran ===
Also known as the Observatoire du Pic de Château Renard, the Observatoire de Saint-Véran was built in 1974 on top of the Pic de Château Renard (), in the commune of Saint-Véran in the Haut Queyras (Hautes Alpes &quot;département&quot;). A coronograph was in operation there for ten years; the dome was moved there from the Perrault building of the Observatoire de Paris.

Nowadays, the AstroQueyras amateur astronomy association operates the facility, using a telescope on loan from the Observatoire de Haute Provence. Numerous asteroids have been discovered there.

==Instruments past and present==
Early telescopes were supplied by the famed craftsman Giuseppe Campani. Cassini, an astronomer who worked in the early days of the Observatory, had used Campani&#x27;s telescopes in the 1660s, and continued to do so when he moved to the Paris Observatory.

The Marly tower, moved to the observatory in 1685 for mounting telescopes, was demolished in 1705. The Marly tower was originally made for the Versailles water supply system (see Machine de Marly), but was moved to the southern gardens area near the Paris Observatory. The tower could hold the objective lens for extremely long focal length aerial telescopes.

In 1732 a quadrant instrument made by Langlois was established at the Observatory.

In 1804 a telescope of 8.4 cm aperture, made by Bellet, was established on the roof of the observatory. In 1807 a Short reflector telescope was acquired, and there were several instruments available including a 9 cm aperture Dollond telescope, and a telescope by Lerebours.

One of the special telescopes in the collection of the observatory, was the Passy telescope of King Louis XV. This telescope was built by Dom Noel in the late 18th century, and was a reflecting telescope with a 61 cm aperture bronze mirror. In 1805 the mirror was re-polished, but it was tarnished again within two years; it remained at the Observatory until it was dismantled in 1841.

A Lerebours telescope of 24.4 cm aperture was installed in 1823, at a cost of 14,500 Francs. In 1835 Arago used this telescope to observe the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet that year.

In 1837 the Gambey mural circle was installed, and also a transit instrument, also by Gambey.

In 1857 a refracting telescope of aperture objective, the Arago equatorial telescope, was completed. This telescope was proposed by director François Arago in 1846. It was installed in the east tower and was made by Lerebours. This instrument is known to have conducted photometry measurements of Jupiter&#x27;s moons (there were only four known at that time) in the late 1880s.

In 1863 a large transit circle was installed, and in 1878 a meridian instrument. The transit circle of 1863 was made by Secretan and Eichens.

In 1875 a 120 cm aperture silver-on-glass reflecting telescope was built, for 400,000 francs (the French unit of currency at that time).

This 120 cm diameter aperture telescope was a silvered glass mirror polished by Martin. However, when it was mounted it was realized the gravity altered its shape because of the mirror&#x27;s weight, thus causing an image quality issue.

In 1886 a Henry astrograph with 13-inch objective was acquired.

For the 1907 Transit of Mercury, some of the telescopes used at the Paris Observatory included:

* Foucault-Eichens reflector ( aperture)
* Foucault-Eichens reflector ( aperture)
* Martin-Eichens reflector ( aperture)
* Several small refractors

The telescopes were mobile and were placed on the terrace for the observations.

===Meudon 83-cm Great Refractor===
The Meudon great refractor (Meudon 83-cm) is an aperture refractor, which, with September 20, 1909 observations by E. M. Antoniadi, helped disprove the Mars canals theory. It is a double telescope completed in 1891, with a secondary aperture lens for photography. It was of the largest refracting telescopes in Europe and was active for a century until 1991. In the 21st century, it was renovated and supports public education and visitation.

The Meudon refractor was built at Meudon Observatory. It is one of three sites of the Paris Observatory; Meudon Observatory became part of the Paris Observatory in 1926. The Meudon Great refractor is the third largest astronomical refractor of its type in the world. The Meudon refractor is located in the &quot;Grande Coupole&quot; building, which was renovated in the early 2000s.

<text>Transcarpathia (, ) is a historical region on the border between Central and Eastern Europe, mostly located in western Ukraine&#x27;s Zakarpattia Oblast.

From the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin (at the end of the 9th century) to the end of World War I (Treaty of Trianon in 1920), most of this region was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the interwar period, it was part of the First and Second Czechoslovak Republics. Before World War II, the region was annexed by the Kingdom of Hungary once again when Germany dismembered the Second Czechoslovak Republic. After the war, it was annexed by the Soviet Union and became part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.

It is an ethnically diverse region, inhabited mostly by people who regard themselves as ethnic Ukrainians, Rusyns, Hungarians, Romanians, Slovaks, and Poles. It also has small communities of Jewish and Romani minorities. Prior to World War II, many more Jews lived in the region, constituting over 13% of its total population in 1930. The most commonly spoken languages are Rusyn, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak, and Polish.

==Toponymy==

The name Carpathian Ruthenia is sometimes used for the contiguous cross-border area of Ukraine, Slovakia and Poland inhabited by Ruthenians. The local Ruthenian population self-identifies in different ways: some consider themselves to be a separate and unique Slavic group of Rusyns and some consider themselves to be both Rusyns and Ukrainians. To describe their home region, most of them use the term &quot;Zakarpattia&quot; (). This is contrasted implicitly with &quot;Prykarpattia&quot; (), an unofficial geographical region in Ukraine, to the immediate north-east of the central area of the Carpathian Range, and potentially including its foothills, the Subcarpathian basin and part of the surrounding plains.

From a Hungarian (and to an extent Slovak and Czech) perspective, the region is usually described as Subcarpathia (literally &quot;below the Carpathians&quot;), although technically this name refers only to a long, narrow basin that flanks the northern side of the mountains.

During the period in which the region was administered by the Hungarian states, it was officially referred to in Hungarian as Kárpátalja (literally: &quot;the base of the Carpathians&quot;) or the north-eastern regions of medieval &quot;Upper Hungary&quot;, which in the 16th century was contested between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire.

The Romanian name of the region is Maramureș, which is geographically located in the eastern and south-eastern portions of the region.

During the period of Czechoslovak administration in the first half of the 20th century, the region was referred to for a while as &quot;Rusinsko&quot; (Ruthenia) or &quot;Karpatske Rusinsko&quot;, and later as Subcarpathian Rus (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Podkarpatská Rus&quot;) or Subcarpathian Ukraine (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Podkarpatská Ukrajina&quot;), and from 1928 as Subcarpathian Ruthenian Land. (Czech: &quot;Země podkarpatoruská&quot;, Slovak: &quot;Krajina podkarpatoruská&quot;).

Alternative, unofficial names used in Czechoslovakia before World War II included Subcarpathia (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Podkarpatsko&quot;), Transcarpathia (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Zakarpatsko&quot;), Transcarpathian Ukraine (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Zakarpatská Ukrajina&quot;), Carpathian Rus/Ruthenia (Czech and Slovak: &quot;Karpatská Rus&quot;) and, occasionally, Hungarian Rus/Ruthenia (; ).

The region declared its independence as Carpatho-Ukraine on March 15, 1939, but was occupied and annexed by Hungary on the same day, and remained under Hungarian control until the end of World War II. During this period the region continued to possess a special administration and the term &quot;Kárpátalja&quot; was locally used.

In 1944–1946, the region was occupied by the Soviet Army and was a separate political formation known as Transcarpathian Ukraine or Subcarpathian Ruthenia. During this period the region possessed some form of quasi-autonomy with its own legislature, while remaining under the governance of the Communist Party of Transcarpathian Ukraine. After the signing of a treaty between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union as well as the decision of the regional council, Transcarpathia joined the Ukrainian SSR as the Zakarpattia Oblast.

The region has subsequently been referred to as &quot;Zakarpattia&quot; () or &quot;Transcarpathia&quot;, and on occasions as &quot;Carpathian Rus’&quot; (), &quot;Transcarpathian Rus’&quot; (), or &quot;Subcarpathian Rus’&quot; ().

==Geography==

Carpathian Ruthenia rests on the southern slopes of the eastern Carpathian Mountains, bordered to the east and south by the Tisza River, and to the west by the Hornád and Poprad Rivers. The region borders Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania, and makes up part of the Pannonian Plain.

The region is predominantly rural and infrastructurally underdeveloped. The landscape is mostly mountainous; it is geographically separated from Ukraine, Slovakia, and Romania by mountains, and from Hungary by the Tisza river. The two major cities are Uzhhorod and Mukachevo, both with populations around 100,000. The population of the other five cities (including Khust and Berehove) varies between 10,000 and 30,000. Other urban and rural populated places have a population of less than 10,000.

==History==

===Prehistoric cultures===
During the Late Bronze Age in the 2nd millennium BC, the region was characterized by Stanove culture; however, it only gained more advanced metalworking skills with the arrival of Thracians from the South with Kushtanovytsia culture in the 6th-3rd century BC. In the 5th-3rd century BC, Celts arrived from the West, bringing iron-melting skills and La Tène culture. A Thracian-Celtic symbiosis existed for a time in the region, after which appeared the Bastarnae. At that time, the Iranian-speaking Scythians and later a Sarmatian tribe called the Iazyges were present in the region. Proto-Slavic settlement began between the 2nd-century BCE and 2nd century CE, and during the Migration Period, the region was traversed by Huns and Gepids (4th century) and Pannonian Avars (6th century).

===Slavic settlement===
By the 8th and 9th century, the valleys of the Northern and Southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains were &quot;densely&quot; settled by Slavic tribe of White Croats, who were closely related to East Slavic tribes who inhabited Prykarpattia, Volhynia, Transnistria and Dnieper Ukraine. Whereas some White Croats remained behind in Carpathian Ruthenia, others moved southward into the Balkans in the 7th century. Those who remained were conquered by Kievan Rus&#x27; in the late 10th century.

===Hungarian arrival===
In 896 the Hungarians crossed the Carpathian Range and migrated into the Pannonian Basin. Nestor&#x27;s Chronicle wrote that Hungarian tribes had to fight against the Volochi and settled among Slavs when on their way to Pannonia. Prince Laborec fell from power under the efforts of the Hungarians and the Kievan forces. According to Gesta Hungarorum, the Hungarians defeated a united Bulgarian and Byzantine army led by Salan in the early 10th century on the plains of Alpár, who ruled over territory that was finally conquered by Hungarians. During the tenth and for most of the eleventh century the territory remained a borderland between the Kingdom of Hungary to the south and the Kievan Rus&#x27; Principality of Halych to the north.

Slavs from the north (Galicia) and east—who actually arrived from Podolia via the mountain passes of Transylvania—continued to settle in small numbers in various parts of the Carpathian borderland, which the Hungarians and other medieval writers referred to as the Marchia Ruthenorum—the Rus&#x27; March. These new immigrants, from the north and east, like the Slavs already living in Carpathian Ruthenia, had by the eleventh century come to be known as the people of Rus&#x27;, or Rusyns. Local Slavic nobility often intermarried with the Hungarian nobles to the south. Prince Rostislav, a Ruthenian noble unable to continue his family&#x27;s rule of Kiev, governed a great deal of Transcarpathia from 1243 to 1261 for his father-in-law, Béla IV of Hungary. The territory&#x27;s ethnic diversity increased with the influx of some 40,000 Cuman settlers, who came to the Pannonian Basin after their defeat by Vladimir II (Monomakh) in the 12th century and their ultimate defeat at the hands of the Mongols in 1238.

During the early period of Hungarian administration, part of the area was included into the Gyepű border region, while the other part was under county authority and was included into the counties of Ung, Borsova and Szatmár. Later, the county administrative system was expanded to the whole of Transcarpathia, and the area was divided between the counties of Ung, Bereg, Ugocsa, and Máramaros. At the end of the 13th and beginning of the 14th century, during the collapse of the central power in the Kingdom of Hungary, the region was part of the domains of semi-independent oligarchs Amadeus Aba and Nicholas Pok. From 1280 to 1320, the north-western part of Carpathian Ruthenia was part of the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia.

Between the 12th and 15th centuries, the area was probably colonized by Eastern Orthodox groups of Vlach (Romanian) highlanders with accompanying Ruthenian populations. Initially, the Romanians were organized into the Voivodeship of Maramureș, formally integrated into Hungary in 1402. All the groups, including local Slavic population, blended together, creating a distinctive culture from the main Ruthenian-speaking areas. Over time, because of geographical and political isolation from the main Ruthenian-speaking territory, the inhabitants developed distinctive features.

===Part of Hungary and Transylvania===

In 1526 the region was divided between the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary and the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. Beginning in 1570 the latter transformed to the Principality of Transylvania, which soon fell under Ottoman suzerainty. The part of Transcarpathia under Habsburg administration was included into the Captaincy of Upper Hungary, which was one of the administrative units of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. During this period, an important factor in the Ruthenian cultural identity, namely religion, came to the forefront. The Union of Brest (1595) and Union of Uzhhorod (1646) were instituted, causing the Byzantine Orthodox Churches of Carpathian and Transcarpathian Rus&#x27; to come under the jurisdiction of Rome, thus establishing the so-called &quot;Unia&quot; of Eastern Catholic churches, the Ruthenian Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

In the 17th century (until 1648) the entire region was part of the Principality of Transylvania and between 1682 and 1685 its north-western part was administered by the Ottoman vassal state of Upper Hungary, while the south-eastern parts remained under the administration of Transylvania. From 1699 the entire region eventually became part of the Habsburg monarchy, divided between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania. Later, the entire region was included into the Kingdom of Hungary. Between 1850 and 1860 the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was divided into five military districts, and the region was part of the Military District of Kaschau.

===Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen===
After 1867, the region was administratively included into Transleithania or the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, many nationalist groups vied for unification or alignment with many different possible nationalities, all arguing that the Rus people would be better off uniting with that nation for security or staying within the nation of Hungary. Many of these groups utilized the ethnic makeup of the region, with ideas such as the Lemko-Boiko-Hutsul schema looking to prove the Slavic nature of the Rus, and therefore justifying union with Russia (or later a Ukrainian state) under the claim that the Rus were part of that Slavic cultural sphere. These Rus or Ruthenians would argue this point until the early 1900&#x27;s when action would be taken.
In 1910, the population of Transcarpathia was 605,942, of which 330,010 (54.5%) were speakers of Ruthenian, 185,433 (30.6%) were speakers of Hungarian, 64,257 (10.6%) were speakers of German, 11,668 (1.9%) were speakers of Romanian, 6,346 (1%) were speakers of Slovak or Czech, and 8,228 (1.4%) were speakers of other languages.

===Transitional period (1918–1919)===

After World War I, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy collapsed and the region was briefly (in 1918 and 1919) claimed as part of the independent West Ukraine Republic. However, for most of this period the region was controlled by the newly formed independent Hungarian Democratic Republic, with a short period of West Ukrainian control.

On November 8, 1918, the first National Council (the Ľubovňa Council, which later reconvened as the Prešov Council) was held in western Ruthenia. The first of many councils, it simply stated the desire of its members to separate from the newly formed Hungarian state but did not specify a particular alternative—only that it must involve the right to self-determination.

Other councils, such as the Carpatho-Ruthenian National Council meetings in Huszt (Khust) (November 1918), called for unification with the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Only in early January 1919 were the first calls heard in Ruthenia for union with Czechoslovakia.

====Rus&#x27;ka Krajina====
&lt;section begin=ruskaKrajina/&gt;
Throughout November and the following few months, councils met every few weeks, calling for various solutions. Some wanted to remain part of the Hungarian Democratic Republic, but with greater autonomy; the most notable of these, the Uzhhorod Council (November 9, 1918), declared itself the representative of the Rusyn people and began negotiations with Hungarian authorities. These negotiations ultimately resulted in the passage of &quot;Law no. 10&quot; by the Hungarian government on December 21, 1918, thereby establishing the autonymous Rusyn province of Rus&#x27;ka Krajina from the Rusyn-inhabited parts of four eastern counties (Máramaros County, Ugocha County, Bereg County, Ung County.

On February 5, 1919, a provisional government for Rus&#x27;ka Krajina was established. The &quot;Rus&#x27;ka rada&quot; (or Rusyn Council), was made up of 42 representatives from the four constituent counties and headed by a chairman, Orest Sabov, and vice-chairman, Avhustyn Shtefan. The following month, on March 4, elections were held for a formal diet of 36 deputies. Upon election, the new diet requested the Hungarian government define the borders of the autonomous region, which had not yet been elaborated; without an established territory, the deputies argued that the diet was useless.

On March 21, 1919 the Democratic Republic of Hungary was replaced by the Hungarian Soviet Republic, which then announced the existence of a &quot;Soviet Rus&#x27;ka Krajina&quot;. Elections organized by the new Hungarian government of a people&#x27;s soviet (council) on April 6 and 7, 1919 led to Rus&#x27;ka Krajina then had two councils: the original diet, and the newly elected soviet. Representatives from both councils then decided to join, forming the &quot;Uriadova rada&quot; (&quot;Governing Council) of Rus&#x27;ka Krajina.

====Fall of Soviet Hungary====
Prior to this, in July 1918, Rusyn immigrants in the United States had convened and called for complete independence. Failing that, they would try to unite with Galicia and Bukovina; and failing that, they would demand autonomy, though they did not specify under which state. They approached the American government and were told that the only viable option was unification with Czechoslovakia. Their leader, Gregory Zatkovich, then signed the &quot;Philadelphia Agreement&quot; with Czechoslovak President Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, guaranteeing Rusyn autonomy upon unification with Czechoslovakia on 25 October 1918. A referendum was held among American Rusyn parishes in November 1918, with a resulting 67% in favor. Another 28% voted for union with Ukraine, and less than one percent each for Galicia, Hungary and Russia. Less than 2% desired complete independence.

In April 1919, Czechoslovak control on the ground was established, when Czechoslovak Army troops acting in coordination with Royal Romanian Army forces arriving from the east—both acting under French auspices—entered the area. In a series of battles they defeated and crushed the local militias of the newly formed Hungarian Soviet Republic, which had created the Slovak Soviet Republic and whose proclaimed aim was to &quot;unite the Hungarian, Rusyn and Jewish toilers against the exploiters of the same nationalities&quot;. Communist sympathizers accused the Czechoslovaks and Romanians of atrocities, such as public hangings and the clubbing to death of wounded prisoners. This fighting prevented the arrival of Soviet aid, for which the Hungarian Communists hoped in vain; the Bolsheviks were also too preoccupied with their own civil war to assist. 

In May 1919, a Central National Council convened in the United States under Zatkovich and voted unanimously to accept the admission of Carpathian Ruthenia to Czechoslovakia. Back in Ruthenia, on May 8, 1919, a general meeting of representatives from all the previous councils was held, and declared that &quot;The Central Russian National Council... completely endorse the decision of the American Uhro-Rusin Council to unite with the Czech-Slovak nation on the basis of full national autonomy.&quot; Note that the Central Russian National Council was an offshoot of the Central Ruthenian National Council and represented a Carpathian branch of the Russophiles movement that existed in the Austrian Galicia.

The Hungarian left-wing writer Béla Illés claimed that the meeting was little more than a farce, with various &quot;notables&quot; fetched from their homes by police, formed into a &quot;National Assembly&quot; without any semblance of a democratic process, and effectively ordered to endorse incorporation into Czechoslovakia. He further asserts that Clemenceau had personally instructed the French general on the spot to get the area incorporated into Czechoslovakia &quot;at all costs&quot;, so as to create a buffer separating Soviet Ukraine from Hungary, as part of the French anti-Communist &quot;Cordon sanitaire&quot; policy, and that it was the French rather than the Czechoslovaks who made the effective decisions.

===Part of Czechoslovakia (1920–1938)===
The Article 53, Treaty of St. Germain (September 10, 1919) granted the Carpathian Ruthenians autonomy, which was later upheld to some extent by the Czechoslovak constitution. Some rights were, however, withheld by Prague, which justified its actions by claiming that the process was to be a gradual one; and Ruthenians representation in the national sphere was less than that hoped for. Carpathian Ruthenia included former Hungarian territories of Ung County, Bereg County, Ugocsa County and Máramaros County.

After the Paris Peace Conference, Transcarpathia became part of Czechoslovakia. Whether this was widely popular among the mainly peasant population, is debatable; clearly, however, what mattered most to Ruthenians was not which country they would join, but that they be granted autonomy within it. After their experience of Magyarization, few Carpathian Rusyns were eager to remain under Hungarian rule, and they desired to ensure self-determination. According to the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920, the former region of the Kingdom of Hungary, Ruthenian Land (&quot;Ruszka Krajna&quot;), was officially renamed to Subcarpathian Ruthenia (&quot;Podkarpatská Rus&quot;).

In 1920, the area was used as a conduit for arms and ammunition for the anti-Soviet Poles fighting in the Polish-Soviet War directly to the north, while local Communists sabotaged the trains and tried to help the Soviet side. During and after the war many Ukrainian nationalists in East Galicia who opposed both Polish and Soviet rule fled to Carpathian Ruthenia.

Gregory Žatkovich was appointed governor of the province by Masaryk on April 20, 1920 and resigned almost a year later, on April 17, 1921, to return to his law practice in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US. The reason for his resignation was dissatisfaction with the borders with Slovakia. His tenure is a historical anomaly as the only American citizen ever acting as governor of a province that later became a part of the USSR.

===Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; (1928–1939)===

In 1928, Czechoslovakia was divided into four provinces: Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia, and the Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;. The main town of the region, and its capital until 1938, was Užhorod. It had an area of , and its 1921 population was estimated as being 592,044.

In the period 1918–1938 the Czechoslovak government attempted to bring the Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, with 70% of the population illiterate, no industry, and a herdsman way of life, up to the level of the rest of Czechoslovakia. Thousands of Czech teachers, policemen, clerks and businessmen went to the region. The Czechoslovak government built thousands of kilometers of railways, roads, airports, and hundreds of schools and residential buildings.

The Rusyn people decided to join the new state of Czechoslovakia, a decision that happened parallel to other events that affected these proceedings. At the Paris Peace Conference, several other countries (including Hungary, Ukraine and Russia) laid claim to Carpathian Rus&#x27;. The Allies, however, had few alternatives to choosing Czechoslovakia. Hungary had lost the war and therefore gave up its claims; Ukraine was seen as politically unviable; and Russia was in the midst of a civil war. Thus the only importance of Rusyns&#x27; decision to become part of Czechoslovakia was in creating, at least initially, good relations between the leaders of Carpathian Rus&#x27; and Czechoslovakia. The Ukrainian language was not actively persecuted in Czechoslovakia during the interwar period, unlike in Poland and Romania. 73 percent of local parents voted against Ukrainian language education for their children in a referendum conducted in Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; in 1937.

===Carpathian Ukraine (1938–1939)===
In November 1938, under the First Vienna Award—a result of the Munich Agreement—Czechoslovakia ceded southern Carpathian Rus to Hungary. The remainder of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; received , with Andrej Bródy as prime minister of the autonomous government. After the resignation of the government following a local political crisis, Avhustyn Voloshyn became prime minister of the new government. In December 1938, Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; was renamed to Carpathian Ukraine.

Following the Slovak proclamation of independence on March 14, 1939 and the Nazis&#x27; seizure of the Czech lands on March 15, Carpathian Ukraine declared its independence as the Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, with Avhustyn Voloshyn as head of state, and was immediately occupied and annexed by Hungary, restoring provisionally the former counties of Ung, Bereg and partially Máramaros.

===Governorate of Subcarpathia (1939–1945)===
On March 23, 1939, Hungary annexed further territories disputed with Slovakia bordering with the west of the former Carpatho-Rus. The Hungarian invasion was followed by a few weeks of terror in which more than 27,000 people were shot dead without trial and investigation. Over 75,000 Ukrainians decided to seek asylum in the Soviet Union; of those almost 60,000 of them died in Gulag prison-camps. Others joined the remaining Czech troops from the Czechoslovak army-in-exile.

Upon liquidation of Carpatho-Ukraine, in the territory annexed the Governorate of Subcarpathia was installed and divided into three, the administrative branch offices of Ung (), Bereg () and Máramaros () governed from Ungvár, Munkács and Huszt respectively, having Hungarian and Rusyn language as official languages.

Memoirs and historical studies provide much evidence that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Rusyn-Jewish relations were generally peaceful. In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia. Jews made up approximately 14% of the prewar population; however, this population was concentrated in the larger towns, especially Mukachevo, where they constituted 43% of the prewar population. 
After the German occupation of Hungary (19 March 1944) the pro-Nazi policies of the Hungarian government resulted in emigration and deportation of Hungarian-speaking Jews, and other groups living in the territory were decimated by war. 
During the Holocaust, 17 main ghettos were set up in cities in Carpathian Ruthenia, from which all Jews were taken to Auschwitz for extermination. Ruthenian ghettos were set up in May 1944 and liquidated by June 1944. Most of the Jews of Transcarpathia were killed, though a number survived, either because they were hidden by their neighbours, or were forced into labour battalions, which often guaranteed food and shelter.

The end of the war had a significant impact on the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of Soviet forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet labor camps. As a result of this development since 1938, the Hungarian and Hungarian-speaking population of Transcarpathia was recorded differently in various censuses and estimations from that time: 1930 census recorded 116,548 ethnic Hungarians, while the contested Hungarian census from 1941 shows as many as 233,840 speakers of Hungarian language in the region. Subsequent estimations are showing 66,000 ethnic Hungarians in 1946 and 139,700 in 1950, while the Soviet census from 1959 recorded 146,247 Hungarians.

===Transition to Soviet takeover and control (1944–1945)===
The Soviet takeover of the region started with the East Carpathian Strategic Offensive in the fall of 1944. This offensive consisted of two parts: the Battle of the Dukla Pass in effort to support the Slovak National Uprising; and the Battle of Uzhgorod to break through to the Hungarian plains and encircle German troops in Transylvania. On 28 October 1944, upon conclusion of the offensive campaign, most of Subcarpathian Ruthenia was secured by the Workers-Peasants Red Army (RKKA).

The Czechoslovak government delegation led by minister František Němec arrived in Khust to establish the provisional Czechoslovak administration, according to the treaties between the Soviet and Czechoslovak governments on 8 May 1944. According to the Soviet–Czechoslovak treaty, it was agreed that once any liberated territory of Czechoslovakia ceased to be a combat zone of the Red Army, those lands would be transferred to full control of the Czechoslovak state. However, after a few weeks, the Red Army and NKVD started to obstruct the Czechoslovak delegation&#x27;s work. Communications between Khust and the government center in exile in London were obstructed and the Czechoslovak officials were forced to use underground radio.

On 14 November 1944 the underground radio &quot;Vladislav&quot; transmitted the following message from Khust to London: &quot;The Red Army is subjugating everything to it. We are requesting information, whether it is discussed with the government. Our situation is critical. An open campaign is ongoing for uniting Subcarpathian Ukraine with the Soviet Union. Forced recruitment to the ranks of the Red Army. People are uneducated. Awaiting your recommendations. We urgently need instructions from the government.&quot;

On 5 November 1944, in anticipation of Soviet rule, the Uzhgorod city council introduced Moscow time (2 hours ahead of Central European Time). According to Magdalena Lavrincova, this was perceived by many as a sign of the totalitarianism to come.

In November 1944, in Mukachevo, there was a meeting of representatives of Communist Party organization from local districts, who created an organization committee to call for a party conference. On 19 November 1944 at the conference in Mukachevo, the Communist Party of Zakarpattia Ukraine was established. The conference also decided to unite Carpathian Ruthenia with the Ukrainian SSR, to strengthen People&#x27;s committees as organs of revolutionary authority, and to organize help for the Red Army. The conference also elected its central committee and its first secretary, Ivan Turyanytsia, and agreed to hold a congress of the People&#x27;s committees on 26 November 1944.

The &quot;National Council of Transcarpatho-Ukraine&quot; was set up in Mukachevo under the protection of the Red Army. On November 26 this committee, led by Ivan Turyanitsa (a Rusyn who deserted from the Czechoslovak army) proclaimed the will of Ukrainian people to separate from Czechoslovakia and join Soviet Ukraine. After two months of conflicts and negotiations the Czechoslovak government delegation departed from Khust on February 1, 1945, leaving Carpathian Ukraine under Soviet control.

===Transcarpathian Ukraine–Soviet Union (1945–1991)===
On 29 June 1945, Czechoslovakia signed a treaty with the Soviet Union, officially ceding the region. Between 1945 and 1947, the new Soviet authorities fortified the new borders, and in July 1947 declared Transcarpathia as a &quot;restricted zone of the highest level&quot;, with checkpoints on the mountain passes connecting the region to mainland Ukraine.

In December 1944 the National Council of Transcarpatho-Ukraine set up a special people&#x27;s tribunal in Uzhgorod to try and condemn all collaborationists with the previous regimes—both Hungary and Carpatho-Ukraine. The court was allowed to hand down either 10 years of forced labour, or the death penalty. Several Ruthenian leaders, including Andrej Bródy and Shtefan Fentsyk, were condemned and executed in May 1946. Avgustyn Voloshyn also died in prison. The extent of the repression showed to many Carpatho-Ruthenian activists how it would not have been possible to find an accommodation with the coming Soviet regime as it had been with all previous ones.

After breaking the Greek Catholic Church in Eastern Galicia in 1946, Soviet authorities pushed for the return to Orthodoxy of Greek-Catholic parishes in Transcarpathia too, including by engineering an accident leading to the death of recalcitrant bishop Theodore Romzha on 1 November 1947. In January 1949 the Greek-Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo was declared illegal; remaining priests and nuns were arrested, and church properties were nationalised and parcelled for public use or lent to the Russian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate), the only accepted religious authority in the region.

Cultural institutions were also forbidden, including the Russophile Dukhnovych Society, the Ukrainophile Prosvita, and the Subcarpathian Scholarly Society. New books and publications were circulated, including the &quot;Zakarpatsk″a Pravda&quot; (130,000 copies). The Uzhhorod National University was opened in 1945 and over 816 cinematographs were open by 1967. The Ukrainian language was the first language of instruction in schools throughout the region, followed by Russian, which was used in academia. Most new generations had a passive knowledge of Rusyn language, but no knowledge about local culture. XIX-century Rusyn intellectuals were labelled as &quot;members of the reactionary class and instruments of Vatican obscurantism&quot;. The Rusyn anthem and hymn were banned from public performance. Carpatho-Rusyn folk culture and songs, which were promoted, were presented as part of Transcarpathian regional culture as a local variant of Ukrainian culture.

In 1924, the Comintern declared all East Slavic inhabitants of Czechoslovakia (Rusyns, Carpatho-Russians, Rusnaks) to be Ukrainians. Starting with the 1946 census, all Rusyns were recorded as Ukrainians; anyone clinging to the old label was considered a separatist and a potential counter-revolutionary.

In February 1945, the National Council confiscated 53,000 hectares of land from large landowners and redistribute it to 54,000 peasant households (37% of the population). Collectivisation of land started in 1946; around 2,000 peasants were arrested during protests in 1948–49 and sent for forced labour in the gulags. Collectivisation, including of mountain shepherds, was completed by May 1950. Central planning decisions set Transcarpatia to become a &quot;land of orchards and vineyards&quot; between 1955 and 1965, planting 98,000 hectares with little results. Attempt to cultivate tea and citrus also failed due to the climate. Most vineyards were uprooted twenty years later, during Gorbachev&#x27;s anti-alcohol campaign in 1985–87.

The Soviet period also meant the upscaling of industrialization in Transcarpathia. State-owned lumber mills, chemical and food-processing plants widened, with Mukachevo&#x27;s tobacco factory and Solotvyno&#x27;s salt works as the biggest ones, providing steady employment to the residents of the region, beyond the traditional subsistence agriculture. And while traditional labour migration routes to the fields of Hungary or the factories of the United States were now closed, Carpathian Ruthens and Romanians could now move for seasonal work in Russia&#x27;s North and East.

The inhabitants of the region grew steadily in the Soviet period, from 776,000 in 1946 to over 1.2 million in 1989. Uzhgorod&#x27;s population increased five-fold, from 26,000 to 117,000, and Mukachevo likewise from 26,600 to 84,000. This population increase also reflected demographic changes. The arrival of the Red Army meant the departure of 5,100 Magyars and 2,500 Germans, while 15–20,000 Jewish survivors of the Holocaust also decided to move out before the borders were sealed. By 1945, around 30,000 Hungarians and Germans had been interned and sent for labour camps in Eastern Ukraine and Siberia; while amnestied in 1955, around 5,000 did not come back. In January 1946, 2,000 more Germans were deported. In return, a large number of Ukrainians and Russians moved to Transcarpathia, were they found jobs in the industry, the military, or the civilian administration. By 1989, around 170,000 Ukrainians (mainly from nearby Galizia) and 49,000 Russians were living in Transcarpatia, mainly in new residential blocks in the main towns of Uzhgorod and Mukachevo, where the dominant language had soon turned from Hungarian and Yiddish to Russian. They kept being considered newcomers (&quot;novoprybuli&quot;) due to their disconnect from the Rusyn- and Hungarian-speaking countryside.

===Transition to independent Ukraine (1991–)===

In July 1991 the Ukrainian SSR adopted a law about referendums that lasted until 2012. Soon after the August coup in Moscow (19–22), on 24 August 1991 the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) of the Ukrainian SSR proclaimed declaration about its independence and also prohibited the Communist Party in the republic. The local nomenklatura remained in confusion for several days following those events. The local People&#x27;s Movement of Ukraine (Rukh) and other activists were organizing protests across the whole oblast (region). The local council of Uzhhorod city renamed the Lenin Square to People&#x27;s Square. On 30 August 1991 during a protest in Uzhhorod a monument of Lenin was removed. Monuments of Lenin were also removed in other settlements; however, this decision was not universally accepted and faced resistance in some instances. In Tiachiv, a municipality which also adopted the decision to remove the monument faced resistance from local &quot;supporters of Lenin&quot; of Roma ethnicity who clashed with Rukh activists. Due to support of the Zakarpattia regional council of the putsch organizers in Moscow (GKChP), the local &quot;democratic forces&quot; were requesting for the council to announce its dissolution. Among those &quot;democratic forces&quot; were members of the Uzhhorod city council, deputies of &quot;Democratic platform&quot; in the regional council, National Movement of Ukraine, Ukrainian Republican Party, Democratic Party of Ukraine, Hungarian Cultural Federation in Transcarpathia (KMKSZ), Shevchenko Association of Ukrainian Language and the regional branch of Prosvita.

Because of the situation in the region, on 26 August 1991 the deputy chairman of the regional council Yuriy Vorobets signed an order to hold an extraordinary session of the council on 30 August, but on 29 August the head of the council Mykhailo Voloshchuk (formerly the 1st secretary of the Zakarpattia regional communist party committee) postponed it by a separate order. On 28 August 1991 the demand for the extraordinary session was supported by the Zakarpattia Democratic League of Youth that previously was part of the Komsomol of Ukraine (LKSMU). To relieve the pressure, Voloshchuk approved a composition of provisional deputy commission for inspection of activity of officials during the putsch that consisted of 17 members mostly of the recently dissolved Communist Party and couple of Rukh members (Mykhailo Tyvodar and Lyubov Karavanska). At the same time Voloshchuk was urgently seeking for other managing positions for other party officials who lost their job with recent liquidation of the party. Concurrently, the regional ispolkom (executive committee) suddenly registered 208 religious communities and transferred property ownership of 83 church buildings to them.

The government of Zakarpattia decided to bet on separatist actions. On 27 August 1991 the Mukachevo city council decided to ask the Zakarpattia regional council to adopt a decision about proclamation of the region as the &quot;Zakarpattia autonomous land of Ukraine&quot;. In two days the Mukachevo Raion council has decided to ask the regional council to petition before the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) to &quot;grant the Zakarpattia Oblast status of autonomous republic&quot;. The latter decision was supported by the Berehove Raion council, Uzhhorod city council and Svaliava Raion council. On 1 September 1991 in Mukachevo, the Association of Carpatho-Rusyns organized a picket with anti-Ukrainian slogans and accusations in &quot;forceful Ukrainization of Rusyns&quot;. At the gathering were adopted statement with demand for autonomy and carrying out a regional referendum on the issue. On 15 September 1991 the same demand were put forward by KMKSZ. Those Rusyns questioned legality of Zakarpattia unification with the Ukrainian SSR in 1945.
By the end of September 1991 in Zakarpattia Oblast has formed two opposing political camps. One camp pro-Ukrainian has united around the National Movement of Ukraine also included URP, DemPU, Party of Greens, Shevchenko Association of Ukrainian Language, regional branches of Prosvita, Memorial and others. The camp also supported by students of the Uzhhorod State University, several members of the Uzhhorod city council, Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo, and small faction of deputies in the regional council. The pro-Ukrainian camp was seeking to reelect the regional council. The other camp consisted of sympathizers of the regional nomenklatura officials (and formerly communist) who were supported by Association of Carpatho-Rusyns, later it was joined by KMKSZ (Association of Hungarian Culture of Zakarpattia). The latter camp also was supported by the Zakarpattia eparchy of Russian Orthodox Church, selected members of the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo as well as by the majority of the regional council. The camp was aimed to prevent reelection of the regional council and obtain autonomous status for the region.

On 27 September 1991 it was finally announced about the extraordinary session of the regional council. The leadership of the council planned to end its work the same day, but the session stretched until 31 October 1991 and the center of political life in Zakarpattia Oblast had relocated to the regional council and the People&#x27;s Square in front of the council&#x27;s building.

In December 1991 Zakarpattia became a part of independent Ukraine. A majority 92.59% of voters of Zakarpattia oblast approved the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. On the same day in Zakarpattia Oblast a regional referendum also took place. 78 percent of voters voted for autonomy within Ukraine, which was not granted.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic groups===

===Religion===
According to a 2015 survey, 68% of the population of Zakarpattia Oblast adheres to Eastern Orthodoxy, while 19% are followers of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church and 7% are Roman Catholics. Protestants and unaffiliated generic Christians make up 1% and 3% of the population respectively. Only one percent of the population does not follow any religion.
The Orthodox community of Zakarpattia is divided as follows:
* Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyiv Patriarchate – 42%
* Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate – 33%
* Non-denominational – 25%

===Issue with self-identity: Ukrainians or Rusyns===

Carpathian Ruthenia is inhabited mainly by people who self-identify as Ukrainians, many of whom may refer to themselves as Rusyns, &quot;Rusnak&quot; or &quot;Lemko&quot;. Places inhabited by Rusyns also span adjacent regions of the Carpathian Mountains, including regions of present-day Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania. Ruthenian settlements exist in the Balkans as well.

In the 19th century and the first part of the 20th, the inhabitants of Transcarpathia continued to call themselves &quot;Ruthenians&quot; (&quot;Rusyny&quot;). After Soviet annexation the ethnonym &quot;Ukrainian&quot;, which had replaced &quot;Ruthenian&quot; in eastern Ukraine at the turn of the century, was also applied to Ruthenians/Rusyns of Transcarpathia. Most present-day inhabitants consider themselves ethnically Ukrainians, although in the most recent census 10,100 people (0.8% of Zakarpattia Oblast&#x27;s 1.26 million) identified themselves as ethnically Rusyn.

===Hungarians===
The following data is according to the Ukrainian census of 2001.
The 1910 Austro-Hungarian census showed 185,433 speakers of the Hungarian language, while the Czechoslovak census of 1921 showed 111,052 ethnic Hungarians and 80,132 ethnic Jews, many of whom were speakers of the Hungarian language. Much of the difference in these censuses reflects differences in methodology and definitions rather than a decline in the region&#x27;s ethnic Hungarian (Magyar) or Hungarian-speaking population. According to the 1921 census, Hungarians constituted about 17.9% of the region&#x27;s total population.

The end of World War II had a significant impact on the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of Soviet forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet labor camps. As a result of this development since 1938, the Hungarian and Hungarian-speaking population of Transcarpathia was recorded differently in various censuses and estimations from that time: 1930 census recorded 116,548 ethnic Hungarians, while the contested Hungarian census from 1941 shows as much as 233,840 speakers of Hungarian language in the region. Subsequent estimations are showing 66,000 ethnic Hungarians in 1946 and 139,700 in 1950, while the Soviet census from 1959 recorded 146,247 Hungarians.

, about 170,000 (12–13%) inhabitants of Transcarpathia declare Hungarian as their mother tongue. Homeland Hungarians refer to Hungarians in Ukraine as &quot;kárpátaljaiak&quot;.

===Jews===

Memoirs and historical studies provide much evidence that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Rusyn-Jewish relations were generally peaceful. In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia. Jews made up approximately 14% of the prewar population; however, this population was concentrated in the larger towns, especially Mukachevo, where they constituted 43% of the prewar population. Most of them perished during the Holocaust.

===Germans===
See Carpathian Germans for more information (mainly Germans from Bohemia, Moravia and the territories from present-day central and eastern Germany) about their settlement in the 16th to 18th centuries.

===Czechs===

Czechs in Carpathian Ruthenia are ethnoculturally distinct from other West Slavic groups like the Slovaks, as they originated from Czech-speaking groups from Bohemia and Moravia instead of Slovakia.

===Romani===
There are approximately 25,000 ethnic Romani in present-day Transcarpathia. Some estimates point to a number as high as 50,000 but a true count is hard to obtain as many Roma cannot afford ID documents for themselves and their children. Additionally, many Romani will claim to be Hungarian or Romanian when interviewed by Ukrainian authorities.

They are by far the poorest and least-represented ethnic group in the region and face intense prejudice. The years since the fall of the Soviet Union have not been kind to the Romani of the region, as they have been particularly hard hit by the economic problems faced by peoples all over the former USSR. Some Romani in western Ukraine live in major cities such as Uzhhorod and Mukachevo, but most live in ghettos on the outskirts of cities. These ghettos are known as &quot;taberi&quot; and can house up to 300 families. These encampments tend to be fairly primitive with no running water or electricity.

===Romanians===

Today some 30,000 Romanians live in this region, mostly in northern Maramureș, around the southern towns of Rahău/Rakhiv and Teceu Mare/Tiachiv and close to the border with Romania. However, there also are Romanians in Carpathian Ruthenia living outside Maramureș, mostly in the village of Poroshkovo. They are usually called in Romanian and live closer to Poland and Slovakia than Romania.

===Greeks===

There are a few Greeks in Carpathian Ruthenia. They are also known as Carpatho-Greeks and Greek-Carpathians.

==Carpatho-Rus under western eyes==
For 19th-century west-European readers, Ruthenia was an inspiration for &quot;Ruritania&quot;, a rustic province lost in forested mountains. Conceived as a Central European kingdom, Ruritania was the setting for several of Anthony Hope&#x27;s novels, including &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1894).

A century later Vesna Goldsworthy, in &quot;Inventing Ruritania: the Imperialism of the Imagination&quot; (1998), theorizes on ideas underpinning western views of Europe&#x27;s &quot;Wild East&quot;, especially Ruthenia and some Slavic Balkan areas. She sees these ideas as highly applicable to Transcarpathia and describes &quot;an innocent process: a cultural great power seizes and exploits the resources of an area, while imposing new frontiers on its mind-map and creating ideas which, reflected back, have the ability to reshape reality.”

<text>Thaba-Tseka is a district of Lesotho. Thaba-Tseka is also the name of the district&#x27;s capital or camptown, which is the only town in the district. In the east, Thaba-Tseka borders on the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. Domestically, it borders on Mokhotlong District in northeast, Leribe District in north, Berea District in northwest, Maseru District in west, Mohale&#x27;s Hoek District in southwest and Qacha&#x27;s Nek District in the southern direction.

The average annual rainfall in the country is , most of which is received during the rainy season of October to April. Though it rains during all the months of the year, groundwater is limited on account of run-offs. The region has a temperate climate on account of the elevation and is humid during most parts of the year. The temperature in low lands vary from to in the winter.

<text>Agnes Grey, A Novel is the first novel by English author Anne Brontë (writing under the pen name of &quot;Acton Bell&quot;), first published in December 1847, and republished in a second edition in 1850. The novel follows Agnes Grey, a governess, as she works within families of the English gentry. Scholarship and comments by Anne&#x27;s sister Charlotte Brontë suggest the novel is largely based on Anne Brontë&#x27;s own experiences as a governess for five years. Like her sister Charlotte&#x27;s 1847 novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, it addresses what the precarious position of governess entailed and how it affected a young woman.

The choice of central character allows Anne to deal with issues of oppression, abuse of women and governesses, isolation, and ideas of empathy. An additional theme is the fair treatment of animals. &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; also mimics some of the stylistic approaches of a bildungsroman, employing ideas of personal growth and coming of age.

The Irish novelist George Moore praised &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; as &quot;the most perfect prose narrative in English letters,&quot; and went so far as to compare Anne&#x27;s prose to that of Jane Austen. Modern critics have made more subdued claims admiring &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; with a less overt praise of Brontë&#x27;s work than Moore.

==Background and publication==
The genesis of &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; was attributed by Edward Chitham to the reflections on life found in Anne&#x27;s diary of 31 July 1845.

It is likely that Anne was the first of the Brontë sisters to write a work of prose for publication, although &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; were all published within the same year: 1847. Anne&#x27;s novel was eventually published by Thomas Newby in a triple-volume format: Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; made up the first two volumes (by virtue of it being the longer), while &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; made up the third.

The original edition of &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, published in 1847, had numerous orthographic, punctuation, and other issues attributed to neglect by the publisher Newby. However, the second edition, published in 1850, had many changes after the careful editing of Charlotte Brontë.

==Plot==
Agnes Grey is the daughter of Mr. Grey, a minister of modest means, and Mrs. Grey, a woman who left her wealthy family and married purely out of love. Mr. Grey tries to increase the family&#x27;s financial standing, but the merchant he entrusts his money to dies in a wreck, and the lost investment plunges the family into debt.

Agnes, her sister Mary, and their mother all try to keep expenses low and bring in extra money, but Agnes is frustrated that everyone treats her like a child. To prove herself and to earn money, she is determined to get a position as a governess. Eventually, she obtains a recommendation from a well-placed acquaintance, is offered a position, and secures her parents&#x27; permission. With some misgivings, she travels to Wellwood house to work for the Bloomfield family.

The Bloomfields are rich and much crueller than Agnes had expected. Mrs. Bloomfield spoils her children while Mr. Bloomfield constantly finds fault with Agnes&#x27;s work. The children are unruly and Agnes is held accountable for them despite being given no real authority over them. Tom, the oldest Bloomfield child, is particularly abusive and even tortures small animals. In less than a year, Agnes is relieved of her position, since Mrs. Bloomfield thinks that her children are not learning quickly enough. Agnes returns home.

She then begs her mother to help her find a new situation. Agnes advertises and is given a position in an even wealthier family – the Murrays. The two boys, John and Charles, are both sent to school soon after her arrival, but the girls Rosalie and Matilda remain her charges. Matilda is a tomboy and Rosalie is a flirt. Both girls are selfish and sometimes unpleasant, and although Agnes&#x27;s position is slightly better than it was at Wellwood house, she is frequently ignored or used in the girls&#x27; schemes.

Agnes begins to visit Nancy Brown, an old woman with poor eyesight who needs help reading the Bible; there Agnes meets the new curate, Mr. Edward Weston. The next day while on a walk Agnes is surprised by Mr. Weston, who picks some wild primroses for her. Agnes later saves one of the flowers in her Bible. She learns that his mother has died not long ago. This new friendship is noticed by Rosalie Murray, who has now entered into society and is a favourite with nearly all suitors in the county.

Rosalie becomes engaged to Sir Thomas Ashby, a wealthy baronet from Ashby Park. She tells Agnes, but makes her promise to keep silent, as she is still going to flirt with other men before she is married. One day, she and Agnes go on a walk and meet Mr. Weston. Rosalie begins to flirt with him, much to Agnes&#x27;s chagrin.

Agnes receives a note from her sister Mary, who is now married to Mr. Richardson, a parson of a rectory near their home. Mary warns that their father is dying and begs Agnes to come. Agnes arrives too late to see her father alive. After his funeral, Agnes opens a small school with her mother, leaving behind the Murrays and Mr. Weston.

She receives a letter from Rosalie who is very unhappy in her marriage and asks Agnes to come for a visit. Agnes is shocked by the change in Rosalie from a merry girl to an unhappy young woman. Rosalie confides that she despises Sir Thomas Ashby (and her mother-in-law), and claims he only left London because he was jealous of all the gentlemen she was attracting. Agnes also hears that Mr. Weston has left the area, and she grieves, believing she will not be able to see him again.

Agnes leaves Ashby Park and returns home. Several months after she arrives, she goes for a walk on the sea shore and encounters Mr. Weston, who had been looking for her since he moved to the nearby parsonage.

He is introduced to Agnes&#x27;s mother, and they forge a bond. Agnes finds her attraction to him growing, and she accepts when he proposes marriage. In the end, Agnes is very happy having married Edward Weston, and they have three children together.

==Characters==
*Agnes Grey—Main protagonist and narrator of the story. She is the younger daughter of Richard Grey, and is determined to take care of herself, to save trouble for her mother.

She does not want to learn anything, but is forced to by Agnes’ being there. She is very fond of horses and wants more than anything to go hunting with her father.
*Rosalie Ashby (formerly Rosalie Murray)—The oldest Murray child, who makes Agnes a sort of confidant. She is a selfish girl who flirts with any man she comes in contact with.

*Mr. Hatfield—Rector near the Murray&#x27;s estate. He has an attraction to Rosalie because of her fortune, and she flirts with him for a while. When he proposes, she laughs at him, and he ends up marrying a rich older woman.
*Nancy Brown—An older woman whom Agnes befriends. In her house, Agnes and Mr. Weston meet. She is a great admirer of Mr. Weston&#x27;s.
*Tom Bloomfield—The oldest Bloomfield child. He is cruel to animals, something Agnes tries to stop, but fails as he is encouraged by his parents and his uncle.
*Mr. Richardson—A middle-aged parson. He marries Mary Grey.

==Style==
&quot;Agnes Grey&quot; has a &quot;perfect&quot; and simple prose style which moves forward gently but does not produce a sense of monotony. George Moore suggested that it conveyed a style with &quot;all the qualities of Jane Austen and other qualities&quot;. Her style is considered both witty and apt for subtlety and irony.

Stevie Davies points to the intellectual wit behind the text: 

==Genre==

Cates Baldridge describes &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; as a novel which &quot;takes great pains to announce itself as a bildungsroman&quot; but in fact never allows its character to grow up or transform for ideological reasons. Baldridge says the early emphasis on Agnes&#x27; bourgeois upbringing allows the reader to form the supposition that the transformative bourgeois class will develop an ideal person of virtue. However, Agnes stalls in her development because of the corrupted nature of the household in which she is employed. As a result, she becomes a static member of the bourgeois, ambivalent to the Victorian value of moral transformation in virtue.

===Autobiographical novel===
&quot;Agnes Grey&quot; is also an autobiographical novel with strong parallels between its events and Anne&#x27;s own life as a governess; indeed, according to Charlotte Brontë, the story of Agnes largely stemmed from Anne&#x27;s own experiences as a governess. Like Agnes, &quot;dear, gentle&quot; Anne was the youngest child of a poor clergyman. In April 1839, she took up a position as a governess with the Ingham family of Blake Hall, Mirfield, in Yorkshire, about 20 miles away from Haworth, to whom the Bloomfields bear some resemblance. One of the more memorable scenes from the novel, in which Agnes kills a group of birds to save them from being tortured by Tom Bloomfield, was taken from an actual incident. In December 1839, Anne, like Agnes, was dismissed.

Anne found a post at Thorp Green, Little Ouseburn, near York, around 70 miles away, just as Agnes&#x27; second position is further from home, with older pupils—Lydia Robinson, 15. Elizabeth, 13, and Mary, 12. There was also a son, Edmund, who was eight when Anne began working there in the spring of 1840. Anne&#x27;s brother Branwell became his tutor in January 1843. The fictional Murrays of Horton Lodge echo the Robinsons; like the &quot;dashing&quot; Mrs. Murray, who &quot;certainly required neither rouge nor padding to add to her charms&quot;, Mrs. Lydia Robinson was a handsome woman of 40 when Anne came to Thorp Green.

Stevie Davies remarks that &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; could be called a &quot;Protestant spiritual autobiography&quot;. First, the book retains a sober tone, and Agnes displays a very strong Puritan personality reflected in her name. Agnes is derived from the Greek for chaste, &quot;hagne&quot;, and Grey commonly is associated with &quot;Quakers and quietists to express radical dissociation from gaudy worldiness&quot;.

F. B. Pinion is of the opinion that &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; &quot;is almost certainly a fictionalized adaptation of &quot;Passages in the Life of an Individual&quot;&quot;. However, he also points to several sections that are &quot;wholly fictitious&quot;:
==Themes==

===Social instruction===
Throughout &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, Agnes is able to return to her mother for instruction when the rest of her life becomes rough. F. B. Pinion identifies this impulse to return home with a desire in Anne to provide instruction for society. Pinion quotes Anne&#x27;s belief that &quot;All good histories contain instruction&quot; when he makes this argument. He says that Anne felt that she could &quot;Reveal life as it is...[so that] right and wrong will be clear in a discerning reader without sermonizing.&quot; Her discussion of oppression of governesses, and in turn women, can be understood from this perspective.

===Oppression===
Events representative of cruel treatment of governesses and of women recur throughout &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;. Additionally, Brontë depicts scenes of cruelty towards animals, as well as degrading treatment of Agnes. Parallels have been drawn between the oppression of these two groups—animals and females—that are &quot;beneath&quot; the upper class human male. To Anne, the treatment of animals reflected on the character of the person. This theme of oppression provided social commentary, likely based on Anne&#x27;s experiences. Twenty years after its publication Lady Amberly commented that &quot;I should like to give it to every family with a governess and shall read it through again when I have a governess to remind me to be human.&quot;

===Animals===
Beyond the treatment of animals, Anne carefully describes the actions and expressions of animals. Stevie Davies observes that this acuity of examination along with the moral reflection on the treatment of animals suggests that, for Anne, &quot;animals are fellow beings with an ethical claim on human protection.&quot;

===Empathy===
Agnes tries to impart to her charges the ability to empathise with others. This is especially evident in her conversations with Rosalie Murray, whose careless treatment of the men who love her upsets Agnes.

===Isolation===
Maria H. Frawley notes that Agnes is isolated from a young age. She comes from a &quot;rural heritage&quot; and her mother brings up her sister and herself away from society. Once Agnes has become a governess, she becomes more isolated by the large distance from her family and further alienation by her employers. Agnes does not resist the isolation, but instead uses the opportunity for self-study and personal development.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Agnes Grey&quot; was popular during what remained of Anne Brontë&#x27;s life despite the belief of many critics at the time that the novel was marred by &quot;coarseness&quot; and &quot;vulgarity,&quot; but it lost some of its popularity afterwards because of its perceived moralising. However, in the 20th century, there was an increase in examination by scholars of &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; and of Anne Brontë. In &quot;Conversation in Ebury Street&quot;, the Irish novelist George Moore provided a commonly cited example of these newer reviews, overtly praising the style of the novel. F. B. Pinion agreed to a large extent that &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; was a masterwork. However, Pinion felt that Moore&#x27;s examination of the piece was a little extreme and that his &quot;preoccupation with style must have blinded him to the persistence of her moral purpose&quot; of Agnes Grey.

<text>In cryptography, a key derivation function (KDF) is a cryptographic algorithm that derives one or more secret keys from a secret value such as a master key, a password, or a passphrase using a pseudorandom function (which typically uses a cryptographic hash function or block cipher). KDFs can be used to stretch keys into longer keys or to obtain keys of a required format, such as converting a group element that is the result of a Diffie–Hellman key exchange into a symmetric key for use with AES. Keyed cryptographic hash functions are popular examples of pseudorandom functions used for key derivation.

==History==
The first deliberately slow (key stretching) password-based key derivation function was called &quot;crypt&quot; (or &quot;crypt(3)&quot; after its man page), and was invented by Robert Morris in 1978. It would encrypt a constant (zero), using the first 8 characters of the user&#x27;s password as the key, by performing 25 iterations of a modified DES encryption algorithm (in which a 12-bit number read from the real-time computer clock is used to perturb the calculations). The resulting 64-bit number is encoded as 11 printable characters and then stored in the Unix password file. While it was a great advance at the time, increases in processor speeds since the PDP-11 era have made brute-force attacks against crypt feasible, and advances in storage have rendered the 12-bit salt inadequate. The crypt function&#x27;s design also limits the user password to 8 characters, which limits the keyspace and makes strong passphrases impossible.

Although high throughput is a desirable property in general-purpose hash functions, the opposite is true in password security applications in which defending against brute-force cracking is a primary concern. The growing use of massively-parallel hardware such as GPUs, FPGAs, and even ASICs for brute-force cracking has made the selection of a suitable algorithms even more critical because the good algorithm should not only enforce a certain amount of computational cost not only on CPUs, but also resist the cost/performance advantages of modern massively-parallel platforms for such tasks. Various algorithms have been designed specifically for this purpose, including bcrypt, scrypt and, more recently, Lyra2 and Argon2 (the latter being the winner of the Password Hashing Competition). The large-scale Ashley Madison data breach in which roughly 36 million passwords hashes were stolen by attackers illustrated the importance of algorithm selection in securing passwords. Although bcrypt was employed to protect the hashes (making large scale brute-force cracking expensive and time-consuming), a significant portion of the accounts in the compromised data also contained a password hash based on the fast general-purpose MD5 algorithm, which made it possible for over 11 million of the passwords to be cracked in a matter of weeks.

In June 2017, The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued a new revision of their digital authentication guidelines, NIST SP 800-63B-3, stating that: &quot;Verifiers SHALL store memorized secrets [i.e. passwords] in a form that is resistant to offline attacks. Memorized secrets SHALL be salted and hashed using a suitable one-way key derivation function. Key derivation functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs then generate a password hash. Their purpose is to make each password guessing trial by an attacker who has obtained a password hash file expensive and therefore the cost of a guessing attack high or prohibitive.&quot; 

Modern password-based key derivation functions, such as PBKDF2, are based on a recognized cryptographic hash, such as SHA-2, use more salt (at least 64 bits and chosen randomly) and a high iteration count. NIST recommends a minimum iteration count of 10,000. 
&quot;For especially critical keys, or for very powerful systems or systems where user-perceived performance is not critical, an iteration count of 10,000,000 may be appropriate.”
== Key derivation ==
The original use for a KDF is key derivation, the generation of keys from secret passwords or passphrases. Variations on this theme include:

* In conjunction with non-secret parameters to derive one or more keys from a common secret value (which is sometimes also referred to as &quot;key diversification&quot;). Such use may prevent an attacker who obtains a derived key from learning useful information about either the input secret value or any of the other derived keys. A KDF may also be used to ensure that derived keys have other desirable properties, such as avoiding &quot;weak keys&quot; in some specific encryption systems.
* As components of multiparty key-agreement protocols. Examples of such key derivation functions include KDF1, defined in IEEE Std 1363-2000, and similar functions in ANSI X9.42.
* To derive keys from secret passwords or passphrases (a &quot;password-based KDF&quot;).
* To derive keys of different length from the ones provided. KDFs designed for this purpose include HKDF and SSKDF. These take an &#x27;info&#x27; bit string as an additional optional &#x27;info&#x27; parameter, which may be crucial to bind the derived key material to application- and context-specific information.
* Key stretching and key strengthening.

=== Key stretching and key strengthening ===

Key derivation functions are also used in applications to derive keys from secret passwords or passphrases, which typically do not have the desired properties to be used directly as cryptographic keys. In such applications, it is generally recommended that the key derivation function be made deliberately slow so as to frustrate brute-force attack or dictionary attack on the password or passphrase input value.

Such use may be expressed as , where is the derived key, is the key derivation function, is the original key or password, is a random number which acts as cryptographic salt, and refers to the number of iterations of a sub-function. The derived key is used instead of the original key or password as the key to the system. The values of the salt and the number of iterations (if it is not fixed) are stored with the hashed password or sent as cleartext (unencrypted) with an encrypted message.

The difficulty of a brute force attack is increased with the number of iterations. A practical limit on the iteration count is the unwillingness of users to tolerate a perceptible delay in logging into a computer or seeing a decrypted message. The use of salt prevents the attackers from precomputing a dictionary of derived keys.

An alternative approach, called key strengthening, extends the key with a random salt, but then (unlike in key stretching) securely deletes the salt. This forces both the attacker and legitimate users to perform a brute-force search for the salt value. Although the paper that introduced key stretching referred to this earlier technique and intentionally chose a different name, the term &quot;key strengthening&quot; is now often (arguably incorrectly) used to refer to key stretching.

== Password hashing ==
Despite their original use for key derivation, KDFs are possibly better known for their use in password hashing (password verification by hash comparison), as used by the passwd file or shadow password file. Password hash functions should be relatively expensive to calculate in case of brute-force attacks, and the key stretching of KDFs happen to provide this characteristic. The non-secret parameters are called &quot;salt&quot; in this context.

In 2013 a Password Hashing Competition was announced to choose a new, standard algorithm for password hashing. On 20 July 2015 the competition ended and Argon2 was announced as the final winner. Four other algorithms received special recognition: Catena, Lyra2, Makwa and yescrypt.

As of May 2023, the Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) recommends the following KDFs for password hashing, listed in order of priority:

# Argon2id
# scrypt if Argon2id is unavailable
# bcrypt for legacy systems
# PBKDF2 if FIPS-140 compliance is required

<doc id="449790" wikidata="Q832444" url="?curid=449790" title="Better Than Chocolate">
<text>Better Than Chocolate is a 1999 Canadian romantic comedy film shot in Vancouver and directed by Anne Wheeler.

==Plot==

Maggie (Karyn Dwyer) has moved out on her own and has started a relationship with Kim (Christina Cox). Maggie&#x27;s mother Lila (Wendy Crewson) and brother are forced to move into her loft sublet with her, but unaware that she is a lesbian. Maggie&#x27;s freedom is compromised, and she believes she must keep her blossoming affair a secret. The clandestine romance introduces Maggie&#x27;s family to a host of new experiences, many of which are &quot;better than chocolate&quot;. The story features Judy, a friend of Maggie&#x27;s who is a transgender woman. Judy develops a friendship with Maggie&#x27;s Mom and helps her to repair her relationship with her daughter. Judy&#x27;s love interest is Frances, owner of the book shop in which Maggie works and purveyor of LGBT literature.

==Cast==
* Karyn Dwyer as Maggie
* Christina Cox as Kim
* Peter Outerbridge as Judy
* Ann-Marie MacDonald as Frances

* Kevin Mundy as Paul, Maggie&#x27;s Brother
* Marya Delver as Carla
* Tony Nappo as Tony
* Jay Brazeau as Mr. Marcus

* Veena Sood as Religious Zealot

==Background ==
The film was created with a budget of $1.6 million. It was co-produced by Peggy Thompson and Sharon McGowan.

The film takes its name from a lyric in Sarah McLachlan&#x27;s song &quot;Ice Cream&quot;, &quot;Your love is better than chocolate&quot;. Veena Sood, the sister of McLachlan&#x27;s then-husband Ashwin Sood, has a small role in the film as a religious protester.

The plot line about the bookstore is a fairly direct reference to Vancouver&#x27;s Little Sister&#x27;s Book and Art Emporium and its travails with Canada Customs. The bookstore is thanked in the credits. Ann-Marie MacDonald, who plays the bookstore&#x27;s owner, is a well-known Canadian author.

The movie poster, which shows two women embracing and one woman&#x27;s naked back, was banned by the Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority as it was deemed &quot;offensive to public morality, decency and ordinary good taste.&quot; An advertisement in the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; was also removed, due to the word &quot;lesbian&quot; being present on the movie poster.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack of the film was released as a CD in 1999 on Lakeshore Records.

<doc id="449794" wikidata="Q841225" url="?curid=449794" title="Squall line">
<text>A squall line, or quasi-linear convective system (QLCS), is a line of thunderstorms, often forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term was used as a synonym for cold front (which often are accompanied by abrupt and gusty wind shifts). Linear thunderstorm structures often contain heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and occasionally tornadoes or waterspouts. Particularly strong straight-line winds can occur where the linear structure forms into the shape of a bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes can grow to become derechos as they move swiftly across a large area. On the back edge of the rainband associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, on very rare occasions associated with a heat burst.

==Theory==
Polar front theory was developed by Jacob Bjerknes, derived from a dense network of observation sites in Scandinavia during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead of the low and another trailing behind the low. The trailing convergence zone was referred to as the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along this convergence zone. The concept of frontal zones led to the concept of air masses. The nature of the three-dimensional structure of the cyclone was conceptualized after the development of the upper air network during the 1940s.
===Life cycle===

Organized areas of thunderstorms activity reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, and they can outrun cold fronts. This outrunning occurs within the westerlies in a pattern where the upper-level jet splits into two streams. The resultant mesoscale convective system (MCS) forms at the point of the upper level split in the wind pattern in the area of best low-level inflow.

The convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines. When the convection is strong linear or curved, the MCS is called a squall line, with the feature placed at the leading edge of the significant wind shift and pressure rise. This feature is commonly depicted in the warm season across the United States on surface analyses, as they lie within sharp surface troughs.

If squall lines form over arid regions, a dust storm known as a haboob may result from the high winds in their wake picking up dust from the desert floor. Well behind mature squall lines, a wake low can develop on the back edge of the rain shield, which can lead to a heat burst due to the warming up of the descending air mass which is no longer being rain-cooled.

Smaller cumulus or stratocumulus clouds, along with cirrus, and, sometimes, altocumulus or cirrocumulus, can be found ahead of the squall line. These clouds are the result of former cumulonimbus clouds having disintegrated, or an area of only minor instability ahead of the main squall line.

As supercells and multi-cell thunderstorms dissipate due to a weak shear force or poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the gust front associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale area of low pressure may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper-level low filling) leading to frontolysis.

From here, a general thinning of a squall line will occur: with winds decaying over time, outflow boundaries weakening updrafts substantially and clouds losing their thickness.

===Characteristics===

====Updrafts====
The leading area of a squall line is composed primarily of multiple updrafts, or singular regions of an updraft, rising from ground level to the highest extensions of the troposphere, condensing water and building a dark, ominous cloud to one with a noticeable overshooting top and anvil (thanks to synoptic scale winds). Because of the chaotic nature of updrafts and downdrafts, pressure perturbations are important. Precipitation cooled air from downdrafts usually outwardly just above the surface and lifts air into the updrafts unless gushing too far out and cutting off this inflow. Visually this process may take the form of a shelf cloud, often with a turbulent appearance.

====Pressure perturbations====
Pressure perturbations around thunderstorms are noteworthy. With buoyancy rapid within the lower and mid-levels of a mature thunderstorm, updraft and downdraft create distinct mesocenters of pressure. As thunderstorms organized in squall lines, the northern end of the squall line is commonly referred to as the cyclonic end, with the southern side rotating anticyclonically (in Northern hemisphere). Because of the Coriolis force, the northern end may evolve further, creating a &quot;comma shaped&quot; wake low, or may continue in a squall-like pattern. The updraft ahead of the line create a mesolow too while the downdraft just behind the line will produce a mesohigh.

====Wind shear====
Wind shear is an important aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.

===Severe weather indicators===
Severe squall lines typically bow out due to the formation of a stronger mesoscale high-pressure system (a mesohigh) within the convective area due to strong descending motion behind the squall line, and could come in the form of a downburst. The pressure difference between the mesoscale high and the lower pressures ahead of the squall line cause high winds, which are strongest where the line is most bowed out.

Another indication of the presence of severe weather along a squall line is its morphing into a line echo wave pattern (LEWP). A LEWP is a special configuration in a line of convective storms that indicates the presence of a low-pressure area and the possibility of damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. At each kink along the LEWP is a mesoscale low-pressure area, which could contain a tornado. In response to very strong outflow southwest of the mesoscale low, a portion of the line bulges outward forming a bow echo. Behind this bulge lies the mesoscale high-pressure area.

===Depiction on maps===
Squall lines are depicted on National Weather Service (NWS) surface analyses as an alternating pattern of two red dots and a dash labelled &quot;SQLN&quot; or &quot;SQUALL LINE&quot;.

==Variations==

=== Derecho ===

A derecho (&quot;from Spanish&quot;: &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;straight&quot;) is a widespread and long-lived, violent convectively induced straight-line windstorm that is associated with a fast-moving band of severe thunderstorms usually taking the form of a bow echo. Derechos blow in the direction of movement of their associated storms, similar to a gust front, except that the wind is sustained and generally increases in strength behind the &quot;gust&quot; front. A warm weather phenomenon, derechos occur mostly in summer, between May and August in the Northern hemisphere. They can occur at any time of the year and occur as frequently at night as in the daylight hours.

The traditional criteria that distinguish a derecho from a severe thunderstorm are &quot;sustained&quot; winds of during the storm as opposed to gusts, high or rapidly increasing forward speed, and geographic extent (typically in length.) In addition, they have a distinctive appearance on radar (bow echo); several unique features, such as the rear inflow notch and bookend vortex, and usually manifest two or more downbursts. Although these storms most commonly occur in North America, derechos occur elsewhere in the world. Outside North America they may be called by different names.

<text>Christina Cox (born July 31, 1971) is a Canadian film and television actress and stuntwoman.

==Early life==

Born in a town on the outskirts of Toronto, Cox is Canadian of Jamaican descent. She has two older sisters. Her father is an automotive executive.

Cox studied theatre and dance at the Arts York program at Unionville High School. She competed in gymnastics, track and field, and taekwondo. She had aspirations of becoming an Olympic gymnast, but instead chose to focus on drama and theater. 

After high school, she studied for two years at the Ryerson Theatre School of Toronto.

She is also proficient in boxing, muay Thai kickboxing, and fencing, and has had training in stage combat, period weaponry, and firearms. 

==Career==

Cox has more than 38 movie and television appearances. Her best-known movie credits include the 1999 Canadian movie &quot;Better Than Chocolate&quot;, and the movie &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;. She received a Gemini Award nomination for her performance as Angela Ramírez in &quot;F/X: The Series&quot;. Cox was an original member of the UPN sitcom &quot;Girlfriends&quot;, cast as Lynn, for the pilot episode.

Cox has appeared in numerous national theater productions, including Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and Jim Cartwright&#x27;s &quot;Road&quot;.

She is a trained stuntwoman who performed boxing stunt work for Hilary Swank in &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot;.

Cox&#x27;s first role as a main character in a television series was that of Vicki Nelson in &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, a supernatural detective series based on the novels by Tanya Huff. Huff later said, &quot;Back when Christina Cox was doing &quot;F/X: The Series&quot;, I used to point at the screen and announce, &#x27;When she&#x27;s a little older, she&#x27;d be brilliant as Vicki!&quot;

She starred as astronaut-biologist Jen Crane in ABC&#x27;s 2009 summer show &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;. Cox also appeared in a Season Four episode of Showtime&#x27;s series &quot;Dexter&quot;, playing villainous police officer Zoey Kruger. She was in the cast of the 2011 ABC summer drama &quot;Combat Hospital&quot; (aka &quot;The Hot Zone&quot;), alongside Elias Koteas and Deborah Kara Unger. She has appeared in NCIS.Freedom (NCIS)

==Personal life==
Cox is married to Grant Mattos, a former NFL wide receiver for the San Diego Chargers. They eloped and married on October 1, 2010, soon after he returned from competing on &quot;&quot;. Their daughter was born in December 2013.

<doc id="449821" wikidata="Q232906" url="?curid=449821" title="Red-crowned crane">
<text>The red-crowned crane (&quot;Grus japonensis&quot;), also called the Manchurian crane (; the Chinese character &#x27;丹&#x27; means &#x27;red&#x27;, &#x27;頂/顶&#x27; means &#x27;crown&#x27; and &#x27;鶴/鹤&#x27; means &#x27;crane&#x27;), is a large East Asian crane among the rarest cranes in the world. In some parts of its range, it is known as a symbol of luck, longevity, and fidelity.

==Description==
Adult red-crowned cranes are named for a patch of red bare skin on the crown, which becomes brighter during the mating season. Overall, they are snow white in color with black on the wing secondaries, which can appear almost like a black tail when the birds are standing, but the real tail feathers are actually white. Males are black on the cheeks, throat, and neck, while females are pearly gray in these spots. The bill is olive green to a greenish horn, the legs are slate to grayish black, and the iris is dark brown.

Juveniles are a combination of white, partly tawny, cinnamon brown, and rusty or grayish. The neck collar is grayish to coffee brown, the secondaries are dull black and brown, and the crown and forehead are covered with gray and tawny feathers. The primaries are white, tipped with black, as are the upper primary coverts. The legs and bill are similar to those of adults but lighter in color. This species is among the largest and heaviest cranes, typically measuring about tall and in length (from bill to tail tip). Across the large wingspan, the red-crowned crane measures . Typical body weight can range from , with males being slightly larger and heavier than females and weight ranging higher just prior to migration. On average, it is the heaviest crane species, although both the sarus and wattled crane can grow taller and exceed this species in linear measurements.

On average, adult males from Hokkaidō weighed around and adult females there averaged around , while a Russian study found males averaged and females averaged ; in some cases, females could outweigh their mates despite the males&#x27; slightly larger average body weight. Another study found the average weight of the species to be . The maximum known weight of the red-crowned crane is . Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures , the exposed culmen measures , tail length is , and the tarsus measures .

==Range and habitat==
In the spring and summer, the migratory populations of the red-crowned crane breed in Siberia (far eastern Russia), Northeast China and occasionally in north-eastern Mongolia (i.e., Mongol Daguur Strictly Protected Area). The breeding range centers in Lake Khanka, on the border of China and Russia. Later, in the fall, they migrate in flocks to the Korean Peninsula and east-central China to spend the winter. Vagrants have also been recorded in Taiwan. In addition to the migratory populations, a resident population is found in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan. This species nests in wetlands, marshes and rivers. In the wintering range, their habitat consists mainly of paddy fields, grassy tidal flats, and mudflats. In the flats, the birds feed on aquatic invertebrates, and, in cold, snowy conditions, the birds switch to mainly living on rice gleanings from the paddy fields.

==Ecology and behaviour==

===Diet===

Red-crowned cranes have a highly omnivorous diet, though the dietary preferences have not been fully studied. They eat rice, parsley, carrots, corn, redbuds, heath berries, acorns, buckwheat, grasses and a variety of water plants such as reeds. The animal matter in their diet consists of fish, including carp and goldfish, amphibians, especially salamanders, snails, crabs, dragonflies, other insects, small reptiles, shrimp, small birds and rodents. The daily food requirement of adult red-crowned cranes is .

They seem to prefer a carnivorous diet, although rice is now essential to survival for wintering birds in Japan and grass seeds are another important food source. While all cranes are omnivorous, per Johnsgard, the two most common crane species today (the sandhill and common cranes) are among the most herbivorous species while the two rarest species (the red-crowned and whooping cranes) are perhaps the most carnivorous species. When feeding on plants, red-crowned cranes exhibit a preference for plants with a high content of crude protein and low content of crude fiber. In Hokkaido, fish such as Tribolodon, Pungitius, Sculpin and flatfish was major prey of adults, while chicks mostly feed on various insects. In Zhalong Nature Reserve, small fish less than , such as common carps, pond loach, and Chinese sleeper was mainly taken as well as aquatic invertebreas like pond snails, dragonflies, water beetles and large amount of plant matter. Elsewhere, mudflat crabs are locally important food source in Yellow River Delta.

They typically forage by keeping their heads close to the ground, jabbing their beaks into mud when they encounter something edible. When capturing fish or other slippery prey, they strike rapidly by extending their necks outward, a feeding style similar to that of the heron. Although animal prey can be swallowed whole, red-crowned cranes more often tear up large prey by grasping with their beaks and shaking it vigorously, eating pieces as they fall apart. Most foraging occurs in wet grasslands, cultivated fields, shallow rivers, or on the shores of lakes.

===Migration===
The population of red-crowned cranes in Japan is mostly non-migratory, with the race in Hokkaidō moving only to its wintering grounds. Only the mainland population experiences a long-distance migration. They leave their wintering grounds in spring by February and are established on territories by April. In fall, they leave their breeding territories in October and November, with the migration fully over by mid-December.

===Sociality===
Flock sizes are affected by the small numbers of the red-crowned crane, and given their largely carnivorous diet, some feeding dispersal is needed in natural conditions. Wintering cranes have been observed foraging, variously, in family groups, pairs, and singly, although all roosting is in larger groups (up to 80 individuals) with unrelated cranes. By the early spring, pairs begin to spend more time together, with nonbreeding birds and juveniles dispersing separately. Even while not nesting, red-crowned cranes tend to be aggressive towards conspecifics and maintain a minimum distance of to keep out of pecking range of other cranes while roosting nocturnally during winter. In circumstances where a crane violates these boundaries, it may be violently attacked.

===Breeding===

The red-crowned crane is monogamous and long-lived, with stable pair-bonding both within and between years, and believed to mate for life. The breeding maturity is thought to be reached at 3–4 years of age. All mating and egg-laying are largely restricted to April and early May. A red-crowned crane pair duets in various situations, helping to establish the formation and maintenance of the pair bond, as well as territorial advertisement and agonistic signaling. Both males and females may start a duet with the production of a start call, but the main part of the duet always began with a long male call. The pair moves rhythmically until they are standing close, throwing their heads back and letting out a fluting call in unison, often triggering other pairs to start duetting, as well. As it occurs year-round, the social implications of dancing are complex in meaning. However, dancing behavior is generally thought to show excitement in the species. Also, the performance of duet displays increased the probability of staying in a favorable area, supporting the hypothesis that duet displays function as a signal of joint resource defense in the flock.
Pairs are territorial during the breeding season. Nesting territories range from and are often the same year after year. Most nesting territories are characterized by flat terrain, access to wetland habitat, and tall grasses. Nest sites are selected by females, but built by both sexes and are frequently in a small clearing made by the cranes, either on wet ground or shallow water over waters no more than deep. Sometimes, nests are built on the frozen surface of water, as frigid temperatures may persist well into nesting season. Nest building takes about a week. A majority of nests contains two eggs, though one to three have been recorded.

Both sexes incubate the eggs for at least 30 days. They also both feed the young when they hatch. Staying in the nest for the first few weeks, the young start to follow their parents as they forage in marshes by around 3 months of age. New hatchlings weigh about and are covered in yellow natal down for two weeks. By early fall, about 95 days after hatching, the young are fledged and are assured fliers by migration time. Although they can fly well, crane young remain together with their parents for around 9 months. Young cranes maintain a higher-pitched voice that may serve to distinguish them from outwardly similar mature birds, this stage lasting until the leave parental care. The average adult lifespan is around 30 to 40 years, with some specimens living to 75 years of age in captivity. It is one of the longest-living species of bird.

===Interspecies interactions===
The red-crowned crane is a big-sized bird and has no natural predators within their wintering ground. With their height averaging , their large size deters most predators. As a result, red-crowned cranes often react indifferently to the presence of other birds such as small raptors; with harriers, falcons, owls, and usually buzzards being allowed to hunt small prey near a crane nest without any of these parties harassing each other. However, birds more likely to be egg or nest predators, such as corvids, some buzzards, and various eagles, are treated aggressively and are threatened until they leave the crane&#x27;s territory. Mammalian carnivores, including small Siberian weasels (&quot;Mustela sibirica&quot;) to large red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), Asian badgers (&quot;Meles leucurus&quot;), common raccoon dogs (&quot;Nyctereutes viverrinus&quot;), and domestic dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;) which pose a threat to eggs and chicks, are attacked immediately, with the parent cranes attempting to jab them in the flanks until the predators leave the vicinity. These predators generally do not present any danger to chicks in the presence of adults and are chased away by the crane without difficulty. Larger predators such as gray wolves (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;) and large dogs can be repelled by aggressive crane pairs.

Occasionally, losses at the nest occur to some of the above predators. Introduced American mink on Hokkaidō are one of the most successful predators of eggs and nestlings. Also, immature and unwary subadult or even adult cranes may be ambushed killed by red foxes in Japan and leopard cats in South Korea, though this is rare reports, especially with adults. More often, these birds can easily defend themselves by using sharp beak or just fly away from danger.

Smaller white-naped cranes often nest near red-crowned cranes, but competition between these species for food in a common nesting area is lessened due to the greater portion of vegetation in the white-naped crane&#x27;s diet. In cases where interactions turn aggressive between white-naped and red-crowned cranes, red-crowned cranes are dominant, as expected due to their considerably larger size. As reported researchers trying to band or examine the cranes or their nest, this powerful species is considered mildly hazardous and prone to respond quickly with considerable aggression to being approached or handled by humans and are able to inflict painful injuries using both its kicking feet and dagger-like beak.

==Status==

The population of red-crowned cranes is split into a migratory continental population in Korea, China, Mongolia and Russia (with all birds wintering in Korea and China), and a resident Japanese population in Hokkaidō. In 2020, winter counts recorded more than 3,800 red-crowned cranes (adults and immatures), including about 1,900 in Japan, more than 1,600 in Korea and about 350 in China. This indicates that there are around 2,300 adults overall. Whereas both the resident Japanese population and the migratory population that winters in Korea have increased in recent decades, the migratory population that winters in China has rapidly decreased. The main threats are habitat loss and fragmentation, but to a lesser extent also human disturbances near their nesting grounds, poisoning and poaching. The red crowned crane is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The National Aviary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ran a program where U.S. zoos donated eggs which were flown to Russia and raised in the Khinganski Nature Reserve and released into the wild. This program sent 150 eggs between 1995 and 2005. The program has been put on hold to concentrate on different crane conservation programs in Russia, such as education and fire suppression. Several hundred red-crowned cranes are kept in zoos around the world. Assuredly, the international efforts of Russia, China, Japan, and Korea are needed to keep the species from extinction. The most pressing threat is habitat destruction, with a general lack of remaining pristine wetland habitats for the species to nest. In Japan, little proper nesting habitat remains and the local breeding population is close to the saturation point.

In South Korea, it has been designated natural monument 202 and a first-class endangered species.

In China, the red-crowned crane is often featured in myths and legends. In Taoism, the red-crowned crane is a symbol of longevity and immortality. In art and literature, immortals are often depicted riding on cranes. A mortal who attains immortality is similarly carried off by a crane. Reflecting this association, red-crowned cranes are called &quot;xian he&quot; (). The red-crowned crane is also a symbol of nobility. Depictions of the crane have been found in Shang dynasty tombs and Zhou dynasty ceremonial bronzeware. A common theme in later Chinese art is the reclusive scholar who cultivates bamboo and keeps cranes. Some literati even reared cranes and trained them to dance to &quot;guqin&quot; music.

The Ming and Qing dynasties endowed the red crowned crane with the cultural connotation of loyalty, uprightness and noble morality. red crowned crane is embroidered on the clothes of a civil servant. It is listed as an important symbol next only to the Loong and Fenghuang used by the royal family. Therefore, people also regard the crane as a symbol of a high official.

The image of red crowned crane generally appears in Chinese cultural relics and works of art.Because of its importance in Chinese culture, the red-crowned crane was selected by the National Forestry Bureau of the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a candidate for the title of national animal of China. This decision was deferred due to the red-crowned crane&#x27;s Linnaean taxonomic name &quot;Grus japonensis&quot;.

Robert Kuok&#x27;s Kerry/Kuok Group also uses the red-crowned crane as its logo for operations in Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China, and overseas.

===Japan===
In Japan, this crane is known as the &quot;tanchōzuru&quot; and is said to live for 1,000 years. A pair of red-crowned cranes was used in the design for the Series D 1000-yen note (reverse side). In the Ainu language, the red-crowned crane is known as &quot;sarurun kamuy&quot; or &quot;marsh kamuy&quot;. At Tsurui, they are one of the 100 Soundscapes of Japan. Cranes are said to grant favours in return for acts of sacrifice, as in &quot;Tsuru no Ongaeshi&quot; (&quot;crane&#x27;s return of a favor&quot;).

Given its reputation, Jerry Huff, an American branding expert, recommended it as the international logo of Japan Airlines, after seeing a representation of it in a gallery of samurai crests. Huff wrote &quot;I had faith that it was the perfect symbol for Japan Air Lines. I found that the crane myth was all positive—it mates for life (loyalty), and flies high for miles without tiring (strength).&quot;


===Korea===

In Korea, the red-crowned crane is called &quot;durumi&quot; or &quot;hak&quot; and it is considered a symbol of longevity, purity, and peace. Korean &quot;seonbis &quot;regarded the bird as an icon of their constancy. The red-crowned crane is depicted on the South Korean 500 won coin and is the symbol of Incheon.

<doc id="449823" wikidata="Q231674" url="?curid=449823" title="Marie Leszczyńska">
<text>Maria Karolina Zofia Felicja Leszczyńska (; 23 June 1703 – 24 June 1768), also known as Marie Leczinska (), was Queen of France as the wife of King Louis XV from their marriage on 4 September 1725 until her death in 1768. The daughter of Stanislaus I Leszczyński, the deposed King of Poland, and Catherine Opalińska, her 42-years and 9 months service was the longest of any queen in French history. A devout Catholic throughout her life, Marie was popular among the French people for her numerous charitable works and introduced many Polish customs to the royal court at Versailles. She was the grandmother of the French kings Louis XVI, Louis XVIII and Charles X.

==Early life==
Born as a member of the House of Leszczyński, Maria Karolina Zofia Felicja Leszczyńska (Wieniawa) was the second daughter of Stanislaus I Leszczyński and his wife, Countess Catherine Opalińska. She had an elder sister, Anna Leszczyńska, who died of pneumonia in 1717.

Maria&#x27;s early life was troubled by her father&#x27;s political misfortune. Ironically, the hopeless political career of King Stanislaus was eventually the reason why his daughter Maria was chosen as the bride of King Louis XV of France. Devoid of political connections, his daughter was viewed by the French as being free from the burden of international alliances.

She was born in Trzebnica in Lower Silesia, the year before her father was made King of Poland by Charles XII of Sweden, who had invaded the country in 1704. In 1709, her father was deposed when the Swedish army lost the military upper hand in Poland, and the family was granted refuge by Charles XII in the Swedish city of Kristianstad in Scania. During the escape, Marie was separated from the rest of her family; she was later found with her nurse hiding in a crib in a stable, although another version claims it was actually a cave in an old mineshaft. In Sweden, the family was welcomed by the queen dowager Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp and became popular members of society life on the estates of the nobility around Kristianstad. In 1712, they made an official visit to Medevi, the spa of the Queen Dowager. During this period in her life, Marie began speaking Swedish with a Scanian accent. As Queen of France, she was known to welcome Swedish ambassadors to France with the phrase &quot;Welcome, Dearest Heart!&quot; in Swedish.

In 1714, Charles XII gave them permission to live in his fiefdom of Zweibrücken in the Holy Roman Empire, where they were supported by the income of Zweibrücken: they lived there until the death of Charles XII in 1718. Zweibrücken then passed to a cousin of his. These lands were parallel to the confiscated Polish properties of Stanislaus. Stanislaus appealed to the Regent of France, the Duke of Orléans, and the Duke of Lorraine for help, with the Queen of Sweden acting as his mediator.

In 1718, with the support of the Duke of Lorraine, the family was allowed to settle in Wissembourg in the province of Alsace, which had been annexed by France, a place suggested by Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, a nephew of Louis XIV and Regent of the Kingdom of France during Louis XV&#x27;s minority. The family lived a modest life in a large town house at the expense of the French Regent.

Their lifestyle in Wissembourg was regarded as very below standard for a royal at that time; they lived in a small house, and could not pay the salary of their small retinue from which a few &quot;served as an apology for a guard of honour&quot;, and the jewels of the former Queen Catherine were reportedly held as security by a moneylender.

While her mother Catherine and grandmother Anna Leszczyńska reportedly suffered from a certain degree of bitterness over their exile and loss of position which worsened their relationship with Stanislaus, whom they occasionally blamed for their exile, Marie was close to her father and spent a lot of time conversing with him, though she was evidently of a different nature as she &quot;possessed the gift of suffering in silence and of never wearying others with her troubles&quot; and was said to have developed &quot;a profound and intense piety&quot;, which gave &quot;to her youthful mind the maturity of a woman who no longer demands happiness&quot;.

==Marriage==
===Early negotiations===

Marie was not described as a beauty; instead her characteristics in the marriage market were stated as those of being pleasant, well-educated, and graceful in manner and movement. In 1720, she was suggested as a bride to Louis Henri de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (who preferred to be known as the Duke of Bourbon, rather than Prince of Condé), but her intended mother-in-law Louise Françoise de Bourbon refused to give her consent. The cavalry regiment provided by the Regent for the family&#x27;s protection included the officer Marquis de Courtanvaux, who fell in love with Marie and asked the Regent to make him a duke so that he might ask for her hand, but the Regent refused and because of his low rank the marriage was impossible. Louis George, Margrave of Baden-Baden, and the third Prince of Baden were suggested, but these suggestions came to nothing because of her insufficient dowry. Stanislaus unsuccessfully tried to arrange a marriage for her with the Count of Charolais, brother of the Duke of Bourbon. In 1724, Count d&#x27;Argensson proposed she marry the new Duke of Orléans, but her intended mother-in-law Françoise Marie de Bourbon wished for a dynastic match with political advantage.
In 1723, the Duke of Bourbon had become the Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. The Regent was dominated by his lover, Madame de Prie. There were lengthy negotiations for a marriage between Marie and the now widowed Duke of Bourbon: Madame de Prie favored the match, as she did not perceive the reputedly unattractive Marie as a threat to her. The marriage negotiations, however, were soon overshadowed when a marriage for King Louis XV, then aged fifteen, was given priority. That year, he fell ill and, fearing the consequences of the unmarried King dying without an heir, the Duc suggested getting him married as soon as possible. He was already engaged to Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, who had been brought to France as his future wife some years earlier. As she was only five years old, there would be no issue expected for many years. With the king sick, it was feared he might die without an heir and that the throne would pass to the Orléans line. This was an undesirable prospect for the Duke of Bourbon, who preferred that the throne should pass to the Spanish line rather than to the Orléans line. Louis XV&#x27;s engagement was broken off and the Infanta was sent back to Spain, to the chagrin of the Spanish. The Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie began negotiations for the immediate marriage of the King to Marie.

===Negotiations for marriage to the King===

Marie Leszczyńska was on a list of 99 European princesses considered eligible to marry the young King. Marie was not the first choice on the list. She had been placed there initially because she was a Catholic princess and therefore fulfilled the minimum criteria, but was removed early on when the list was reduced from 99 to 17 for being too poor.

However, the candidates preferred to her were all eventually discarded from the list for a number of different reasons. Among the serious candidates were Landgravine Caroline of Hesse-Rotenburg; removed &quot;on account of her bad temper&quot;; Elizabeth of Russia; removed because of her mother&#x27;s commoner background; Barbara of Portugal; removed because of the bad health of her family; Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark; removed because it could cause conflict with France&#x27;s ally Sweden; Elisabeth Therese of Lorraine; removed because the House of Lorraine was too closely related to the Habsburgs; and Enrichetta d&#x27;Este; removed because of the disorderly situation within her family.

When the list of 17 was further reduced to four, the preferred choices still presented numerous problems. Anne and Amelia of Great Britain, who were considered with the understanding that they would convert to the Catholic faith upon marriage, were favored by the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie because they were supported by their political financiers, the firm of Paris Brothers. Cardinal Fleury easily prevented the British match because of religious reasons. The other two women on the list were the sisters of the Duke of Bourbon, Henriette-Louise and Élisabeth-Alexandrine, whom the King refused to marry because of the disapproval of Cardinal Fleury. Cardinal Fleury favored a match with Princess Charlotte of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, which was supported by the maternal grandfather of Louis XV, the King of Sardinia through his spy the Princess of Carignan, Maria Vittoria of Savoy.

In these complicated disputes over the choice of a royal marriage partner, Marie Leszczyńska eventually emerged as a choice acceptable to both the party of the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie, as well as the party of Cardinal Fleury, mainly because she was politically uncontroversial and lacked any of the alliances which could harm either party. At this point, there were already negotiations of marriage between Marie and the Duke of Bourbon. The Duke of d&#x27;Argensson had already left a favorable report of her, and the groundwork had been done. Cardinal Fleury accepted the choice as Marie posed no threat to him because of her lack of connections, while the Duke of Bourbon and Madame de Prie, precisely because she lacked any personal power base, expected her to be indebted to them for her position. Marie was finally chosen because she was a healthy adult Catholic princess ready to procreate immediately after the wedding. Reportedly, Madame de Prie had a flattering portrait painted of Marie, in which she was deliberately made to look like the King&#x27;s favorite portrait of his mother. When he was shown the portrait, he was impressed and exclaimed: &quot;She is the loveliest of them all!&quot; and became enthusiastic of the match, an episode which attracted some attention.

The formal proposal was made on 2 April 1725. The announcement of the wedding was not received well at the royal court. Marie&#x27;s father Stanislaus had been a monarch for only a short time and she was thought to be a poor choice and of inferior status, not worthy of being queen of France. The Duchess of Lorraine, sister of the former Duke of Orléans was also insulted that her own daughter Elisabeth-Therese had not been chosen. The nobility and the court looked upon the future queen as an upstart intruder, the ministers as a cause to diplomatic trouble with Spain and Russia, whose princesses had been refused in favor of Marie, and the general public was also reportedly initially dissatisfied with the fact that France would gain &quot;from this marriage neither glory nor honor, riches nor alliances.&quot; There were rumors before the wedding that the bride was ugly, epileptic and sterile. On 6 May 1725, Marie was forced to undergo a medical examination, which ruled out epilepsy and also gave reassuring reports about her menstruation and ability to procreate. In the marriage contract, the same terms were given to her as were previously given to the Spanish Infanta, and she was thus guaranteed fifty thousand crowns for rings and jewelry, two hundred and fifty thousand crowns upon her wedding, and the further guarantee of an annual widow allowance of twenty thousand crowns.

===Private relationship to Louis XV===

The marriage by proxy took place on 15 August 1725 in the Cathedral of Strasbourg, Louis XV being represented by his cousin, the Duke of Orléans &quot;Louis le Pieux&quot;. For her marriage, Maria&#x27;s Polish name was changed to the French &quot;Marie&quot;. Despite her surname being difficult for the French to pronounce, it was still often used by commoners. She was escorted by Mademoiselle de Clermont, seven ladies-in-waiting, two maids-of-honour, numerous equerries and pages in a long train of coaches; however, she was not welcomed by triumphal entries, diplomatic greetings or the other official celebrations, as was normally the custom upon the arrival of a foreign princess for a royal marriage. Marie made a good impression upon the public from the beginning, such as when she handed out &quot;&quot; on her way to her wedding in Fontainebleau.

Louis and Marie first met on the eve of their wedding on 4 September 1725 at the Château de Fontainebleau. Marie was twenty-two years old and Louis fifteen. The couple were reported to have fallen in love at first sight, based on eyewitness accounts such as those of Cardinal de Rohan&#x27;s letter and that of the Duke de Bourbon who were present when they met. Their relationship was very happy and idyllic at first and for eight years Louis XV was faithful to his wife. The Duke de Richelieu, best friend of the King, noted in his memoirs that Louis XV had a &quot;true passion&quot; for Marie Leczinska and at first resisted the idea on taking a mistress while his wife was always pregnant. He had been impatient to marry her, was reportedly flattered to have a twenty-two-year-old wife, and refused to allow criticism of her appearance.

In August 1727, at Versailles, Marie gave birth to twins, named Louise Élisabeth and Anne Henriette. The King was delighted, declaring that, after it had been said that he could not become a father, he had become the father of two. His first minister, Cardinal Fleury, however, was displeased and decided that until the Queen had given birth to a son she could not be allowed to accompany the King on his trips but had to stay at Versailles. A year later, to the King&#x27;s disappointment, another daughter, Marie Louise, was born. The long-awaited dauphin, Louis, was born on 4 September 1729 to the relief of a country whose royal family had had a history of failing to establish a secure male line of succession.

Marie had ten live children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. They all regarded her as a model of virtue, particularly her daughters. Marie, being of a phlegmatic nature, was not known to show them much affection. However, numerous contemporary accounts such as her own children&#x27;s letters show a caring and attentive mother. Close friends such as the Duke de Luynes and lady in waiting Marechale de Mouchy or the Barrister Barbier noted in their memoirs that &quot;the Queen loved her children tenderly&quot; and was said to be giving them &quot;hugs and kisses&quot; and supervise their education. She would also conduct and regularly send gifts and write letters to her younger daughters whom she was forbidden to see at Fontevraud. According to the diaries, Marie Leczinska consoled her children on their personal problems and physically nursed them whenever they were ill.

Marie was regarded as plain and slender in appearance by her contemporaries but with a fresh and healthy complexion. That faded with age but piety precluded her from using artificial means to make herself look attractive. She was described as shy and reserved in the company of her husband. She considered it her duty to show him gratitude and reverence but was unable to relax enough to entertain him or to flirt with him. Once, for example, she could find no other way to entertain him than to suggest that he kill the flies in the window panes.

Louis XV, who suffered from melancholy and boredom, became inclined to listen when Marie was unfavorably compared to other women, and Cardinal Fleury, who wished to prevent Marie from eventually getting any influence over the King, favored the idea of the King taking a mistress as long as she was apolitical.

Louis XV eventually became a notorious womanizer. In 1733, he entered into his first affair with Louise Julie de Mailly; until 1737, this relationship was not official, and she was known at court as the &quot;Fair Unknown&quot;. During these years, Marie unsuccessfully tried to figure out who the mistress was and did display her displeasure over the state of affairs. However, the adultery had the support of Cardinal Fleury because de Mailly was not interested in politics, and after the first years of the king&#x27;s adultery, Marie became resigned to it. After the difficult birth of Princess Louise in 1737, which nearly took her life, Marie was advised by the doctors that another pregnancy may end her life, and from 1738, she refused Louis entrance to her bedroom.

In parallel with this, Louise Julie de Mailly was officially recognized as the King&#x27;s royal mistress and favorite at court, and the relationship between the King and Queen soured, though they continued to perform their ceremonial roles side by side. The King paid only purely ceremonial visits to her rooms and no longer participated in her card games. The court, wary of her loss of the King&#x27;s affection, only attended to her when court representation required it. Louise Julie de Mailly was followed by Pauline Félicité de Mailly in 1739, Marie Anne de Mailly in 1742 and Diane Adélaïde de Mailly also in 1742. During the serious illness of Louis XV in Metz in August 1744, when he was believed to be dying, Marie was given his permission to join him. She was cheered by the supporting public along her journey, but when she arrived, he no longer wished to see her. She and the clergy supported the idea of the King exiling his mistress Marie Anne de Mailly including her sister, and the idea that the King should make a public apology for his adultery, but this did not improve their marriage.

Madame de Pompadour was presented at court in 1745 and was given such an important and influential position at court until her death in 1764 that she somewhat eclipsed the Queen. The lovers of Louis were often given positions in the court of Marie in order for them to have permanent access and an official excuse to remain at court, which placed Marie in a difficult position. She regarded the first official mistress Louise Julie de Mailly as the most hurtful because she was the first; however, she disliked Marie Anne de Mailly on a more personal level because Marie Anne was haughty and insolent. In contrast to the other official mistresses, Marie had a moderately friendly and cordial relationship to Madame de Pompadour, who always treated the Queen with deference and respect, though Marie did unsuccessfully oppose Pompadour&#x27;s appointment as a lady-in-waiting in 1756. In contrast, Marie seems never to have had extramarital relations.

==Queen of France==
===Political role===
Queen Marie never managed to develop political influence and instead focused on numerous charitable activities such giving money, edible foods, medicines as well as sewing and making clothes to the poor which was appreciated by ordinary Frenchmen. After her marriage, her appointed court consisted of a great number of followers of the Duke of Bourbon, among them Madame de Prie, the Duchess de Béthune, and the Marquise de Matignon, who, among her twelve ladies-in-waiting or &quot;dame du palais&quot;, the Duke&#x27;s own sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, became her &quot;Surintendante de la Maison de la Reine&quot; and Paris de Verney was appointed as her secretary. Cardinal de Fleury, who had been Louis&#x27;s tutor, was appointed her grand almoner.

Marie had been given advice by her father to always loyally stand by the Duke of Bourbon, to whom she owed her marriage and position, and it was a favor to the Duke that Marie made her first attempt to interfere in politics. On 17 December 1725 the Duke of Bourbon, Madame de Prie and Paris de Verney attempted to banish Cardinal de Fleury through a plot. On their instruction, the Queen called on the King to come to her chambers, where the Duke de Bourbon was present. The doors were locked to ensure secrecy and the Duke presented the King with a report from their ambassador in Rome which blamed Fleury for the French failure in a dispute with the Pope. Bourbon asked the King if they should write a reply, which the King refused without the presence of Fleury. Meanwhile, Cardinal Fleury learned of the plot to discredit him and left the palace. The Duke and de Prie planned to use the absence of Fleury to have him confined to an abbey, and gave Marie the task of informing Louis XV that the absent Fleury wished to enter an Abbey and leave his position at court. This led to a crisis when the King gave Bourbon the choice to either expel Madame de Prie and Paris de Verney or be removed from his post of prime minister. This incident led to Cardinal Fleury categorizing Queen Marie as his opponent, and his decision to oust the ministry of the Duke of Bourbon. Cardinal Fleury warned the King that no woman should be allowed to participate in state affairs and that listening to women&#x27;s advice would lead to disaster.

In June 1726, Fleury convinced the King to deprive the Duke of Bourbon of his ministry. Madame de Prie immediately enlisted the Queen to speak to the King in favor of Bourbon. She protested but agreed and reportedly spoke passionately about the affair to the King, but she was unable to succeed as the King reacted very negatively to her attempt to interfere in politics after the preparation from Fleury that women should not be allowed to participate in state affairs. The day following the fall of the Duke de Bourbon&#x27;s ministry, Louis XV stated to Queen Marie that he demanded of her to let herself be directed by Cardinal Fleury in the future with the words:
:&quot;I beg, Madame, and, if necessary, I order you to place credence in everything that the former Archbishop of Frejus tells you on my behalf, as though he were I – Louis&quot;.

Marie&#x27;s attempt to participate in state affairs during the events of 1726 resulted in a crisis in her relationship with Louis XV, and she sought advice on how to behave from the Princess of Carignano, who, unbeknownst to her, was a spy in service of Savoy. The princess&#x27; advice was that as Queen of France, it was Marie&#x27;s duty not to become involved in political intrigues and plots, but to act as an example of virtue and piety; a role model of a &quot;Catholic consort of the Most Christian King&quot;. Queen Marie accepted the advice and followed it for the rest of her life, as she was never again involved in any political activity. After the 1726 crisis and until the birth of a dauphin in 1729, Cardinal Fleury and the Princess of Carignano made long running preparations to replace Marie if she should die in childbirth, preferably with Charlotte of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg.

Marie reconciled with Cardinal Fleury, whom she kept contact with through letters and humbly entrusted to advise her how to behave in order to please the King. Fleury and Marie developed a cordial relationship and he often granted her his support when he estimated that her request to the King was harmless; such as in 1742, when the Cardinal, on her request, persuaded the King to allow her to appoint her personal friend Amable-Gabrielle de Villars as &quot;Dame d&#x27;atours&quot;. Her political activity after 1726 was limited to asking Louis XV to grant a pension or a promotion to a friend, and she often used Cardinal Fleury as a mediator to achieve this.

Despite her lack of influence, she did have political views, and also some indirect political importance. During the War of the Polish Succession in 1733–1736, she supported her father&#x27;s candidacy to the Polish throne, and upon her father&#x27;s demand, she did her best to encourage Cardinal Fleury to support her father&#x27;s candidacy, but she expressed to the Cardinal that she had never wished for the war and that she was an innocent cause of it because the French wished to enhance her dynastic status. After the war, her father was given the Duchy of Lorraine because he was the father-in-law of the King of France, and the Duchy became part of France after the death of her father who became Duke of Lorraine, thus making herself indirectly useful in the political arena. As a devout Catholic, Queen Marie gave her passive support to the so-called Dévots party at court, supported the bishops in their conflicts with the Parlement of Paris, and expressed sympathy for the Jesuit order in their conflict with the crown. It was also a fact, that if the King should die before his son was an adult, then she would in accordance with custom have become regent of France until his 13th birthday, which made Marie a potential regent from the birth of the dauphin until his 13th-birthday, a fact which would have been well known at court.

===Role as queen===

Queen Marie was initially not respected by the royal court, where she was regarded as low-born. Her lack of dynastic status and lack of connections left her without a political power base, and she did not manage to acquire any personal or political influence. She was not credited with any personal significance and not given much personal attention outside of her ceremonial role as queen.

As queen, Marie Leszczyńska performed her ceremonial role in strict accordance with formal court etiquette and regularly and punctually fulfilled all the numerous representational duties that the court life at Versailles demanded of her. She valued the ritualized pomp and court presentations in order to increase her dignity and win the respect of the court nobility, which was necessary because she had no prestigious dynastic connections of birth and was thus initially seen as low born by them: her successor as queen, Marie Antoinette, was to ignore many of these rules, and once pointed out, that in contrast to her predecessor Queen Marie Leszczyńska, it was not necessary for her to enhance her status and dignity since her dynastic status was evident by birth, and that she could therefore afford to relax on her etiquette without losing respect.

Marie was given an allowance of 100.000 livres for pleasure, charity and gambling, a sum which was in reality often irregularly paid and also insufficient, as she was often in debt. Though she had simple habits, her apartments at Versailles were not redecorated after 1737 – her favorite game, &quot;cavagnole&quot;, often placed her in debt, and the King was normally unwilling to pay these off for her.

She accepted that her courtiers were appointed because of rank rather than personal preference, and conversed politely with those who were in attendance. However, though she was careful to always fulfill her representational role, she never participated in court life outside of what was necessary to fulfill her ceremonial duties, and when they were done, she preferred to retire to her private apartments with an intimate circle of friends. Among her own private friends were her grand almoner Cardinal de Luynes, Duke Charles Philippe d&#x27;Albert de Luynes and her&quot; Dame d&#x27;honneur&quot; Marie Brûlart as well as the wealthy widow of the late Regent the Dowager Duchess of Orleans: Francoise Marie de Bourbon (legitimized daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan), who would invite and organized parties in her palaces in Paris for Marie Leszczyńska. Her other favorite lady in waiting was her &quot;Dame d&#x27;atour&quot;, Françoise de Mazarin, who supported Marie during the affair between her cousin, Louise Julie de Mailly and the King. Marie&#x27;s private circle of friends was completed with the addition of President Hénault (her &quot;Surintendant&quot; since 1753) and Comte d&#x27;Argenson, whom she had asked not to address her with her title and with whom she also consulted when she wished to have a pension or a promotion given to a protégé. Like her mother, Marie maintained a political correspondence with Margareta Gyllenstierna, the spouse of Arvid Horn, after she had made her acquaintance during her stay in Sweden.

Queen Marie eventually did manage to win the respect of the court nobility by her strict adherence to court etiquette, which made her opinion at least formally important. In 1747, Voltaire was banished from the royal court through her influence. The reason were two incidents, both of which insulted the queen: During one long night of gambling, Voltaire&#x27;s lover, Emilie du Chatelet, lost a fortune at the Queen&#x27;s gambling table, during which Voltaire whispered to her in English that she had been cheated. This was regarded as an insult to the Queen, because it denounced her guests as cheats; Voltaire could have been arrested for his ill-timed remark. Shortly afterward, Voltaire wrote a poem in honor of his patron, the royal mistress Madame de Pompadour, in which he alluded to the sexual relationship between Pompadour and the King. This insulted Marie and led to the banishment of Voltaire from court.

When her first daughter-in-law died in 1746, the Queen, very fond and loving of her only son, opposed the selection of his next spouse, the Duchess Marie-Josèphe of Saxony, because she was the daughter of her father&#x27;s rival, King Augustus III of Poland. Her dislike of the match was known but ignored, as she had no dynastic connections. Initially, this issue caused some friction between the Queen and her new daughter-in-law. However, the friction was soon overcome, reportedly because Marie-Josèphe was an admirer of the Queen&#x27;s father. In honour of him, several of the Queen&#x27;s grandsons received the name Stanislaus (Stanislas in French) at their christening.

Marie played a great part as a cultural and art patron. The Queen was the benefactor of the painters Charles-Antoine Coypel whom she commissioned 34 religious paintings in her apartments as well as Jean-Marc Nattier, whom she commissioned in 1748 to paint the last portrait she ever sat for, an unusual one as it was informal. It was a major success for Jean-Marc, as it was printed and sold in prints. It was also her favorite portrait, which she had reproduced to give to friends. She was the one who introduce and made popular the Polish style bed in French interior design. In the culinary side, Marie made eating lentils popular in France and was also noted for inventing along with her chefs the now famous French meat pastry called &quot;bouchée à la reine&quot; in 1735. Furthermore, President Henault and de Luynes noted that Queen Marie was fluent in seven languages such as Italian, German, French, Latin, Swedish, and English aside from her native Polish and was very useful when receiving foreign ambassadors. Louis XV&#x27;s wife was a great lover of music as she played the hurdy gurdy, harpsichord and guitar and was an avid engraver and painter. Marie was also skilled in embroidery and needlework wherein she gave her creations to poor churches and was the promoter of many other artists such as Alexis-Simon Belle, Piere Gobert, Jean Louis Tocque, Charles Van Loo, Maurice Quentin de Latour Hyacinth Rigaud and the poet Moncrift. Duke de Luynes stated in his memoirs that it was Marie who originally introduce the porcelain flowers to courtiers in Versailles by displaying it in her apartments in April 1748 after having it commissioned from Sèvres. Also at Versailles, the Queen invited the castrato Farinelli in 1737 whom she received singing lessons from, and the young Mozart in 1764, whom she found very charming. During his visit to the palace, Marie acted as an interpreter for her spouse and family who did not understand German. Her major contribution to life at Versailles was the weekly Polish choral concerts.

Queen Marie maintained the role and reputation of a simple and dignified Catholic queen. She functioned as an example of Catholic piety and was framed for her generosity to the poor and needy through her philanthropy which included establishing workhouses, livelihood programs and financial assistance for the poor as well as supporting orphanages and hospitals, which made her very popular among the public her entire life as Queen.

==Death and burial==
Marie Leszczyńska died on 24 June 1768, one day after her birthday, at the age of 65. She had enjoyed great popularity among the public in her early and later years. She was buried at the Basilica of St Denis, and her heart was entombed at the Church of Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours in Nancy.

<text>U.S. News &amp; World Report (USNWR, US NEWS) is an American media company publishing news, consumer advice, rankings, and analysis. The company was launched in 1948 as the merger of domestic-focused weekly newspaper &quot;U.S. News&quot; and international-focused weekly magazine &quot;World Report&quot;. In 1995, the company launched its website, &quot;usnews.com&quot; and, in 2010, ceased printing its weekly news magazine, publishing only its ranking editions in print. &quot;US News&quot; licences its name to the subjects it ranks, so they may then use the annual rankings in promotional literature.

==History==
===20th century===
After the closure of &quot;United States Daily&quot;, which was published between 1926 and 1933, David Lawrence (1888–1973) founded the newspaper United States News in 1933, which was converted to magazine format in 1940. 

In 1946, Lawrence founded the magazine &quot;World Report&quot;. The two magazines covered national and international news separately. In 1948, Lawrence merged them into &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. He then sold the magazine to his employees. The magazine initially tended to be slightly more conservative than its two primary competitors, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, focusing more on economic, health, and education stories. It also eschewed sports, entertainment, and celebrity news. 

Important milestones in the early history of the magazine include the introduction of the &quot;Washington Whispers&quot; column in 1934, and the &quot;News You Can Use&quot; column in 1952. In 1958, the weekly magazine&#x27;s circulation passed one million reaching two million by 1973.

Since 1983, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; has been known primarily for its influential ranking and annual reports of colleges and graduate schools, spanning across most fields and subjects. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; is America&#x27;s oldest and best-known ranker of academic institutions, and covers the fields of business, law, medicine, engineering, education, social sciences and public affairs, in addition to many other areas. Its print edition consistently has been included in national bestseller lists, augmented by online subscriptions. Additional rankings published by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; include hospitals, medical specialties, and automobiles.

In October 1984, New York City-based publisher and real estate developer Mortimer Zuckerman purchased &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. Zuckerman had owned the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. In 1993, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; entered the digital world by providing content to CompuServe and in 1995 the website usnews.com was launched.

===21st century===
In 2001, the website won a National Magazine Award for General Excellence Online. In 2007, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; published its first list of the nation&#x27;s best high schools. Its ranking methodology included state test scores and documented the success of poor and minority students on the exams, and schools&#x27; performance in Advanced Placement exams.

Beginning in June 2008, the magazine reduced its publication frequency in three steps. In June 2008, citing a decline overall in magazine circulation and advertising, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; announced that it would become a biweekly publication, starting in January 2009. It hoped advertisers would be attracted to the schedule, which allowed ads to stay on newsstands a week longer. However, five months later the magazine changed its frequency again, becoming monthly. 

In August 2008, &quot;U.S. News&quot; expanded and revamped its online opinion section. The new version of the opinion page included daily new op-ed content as well as the new Thomas Jefferson Street blog. An internal memo was sent to the magazine&#x27;s staff on November 5, 2010, informing them that the &quot;December issue will be our last print monthly sent to subscribers, whose remaining print and digital replica subscriptions will be filled by other publishers.&quot; The memo said that the publication would be moving to a primarily digital format but that special issues such as &quot;the college and grad guides, as well as hospital and personal finance guides&quot; would be printed.

Prior to ending physical publication in 2010, &quot;U.S. News&quot; was generally the third-ranked general United States-based news magazine after &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;. A weekly digital magazine, &quot;U.S. News Weekly&quot;, introduced in January 2009, continued to offer subscription content until it stopped publication at the end of April 2015.

==Ownership==
The company is owned by U.S. News &amp; World Report, L.P., a privately held company with editorial headquarters in Washington, D.C. and its advertising, sales, and corporate offices in New York City and New Jersey. The company&#x27;s move to the Web made it possible for &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; to expand its service journalism with the introduction of several consumer-facing rankings products. 

By the early 2010s, under the leadership of Brian Kelly, the company had returned to profitability, largely through its list model, adopted in 2009, and the ease with which that transferred to online publishing. 

The leadership team includes executive chairman Eric Gertler, president and chief executive officer William Holiber, chief financial officer and chief operating officer Neil Maheshwari, and Dafna Linzner, the editorial director. Brian Kelly was the chief content officer from April 2007 to August 2019 and Kim Castro was the chief content officer until 2023. The company is owned by media proprietor Mortimer Zuckerman.

==Rankings==
===Who Runs America?===
The first &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s rankings was its &quot;Who Runs America?&quot; surveys. They were published in the spring annually from 1974 to 1986. The magazine cover for each release featured persons selected by the &quot;USN &amp; WR&quot; as being the ten most powerful persons in the United States. Each edition of the series listed the president of the United States as the most powerful person, but the #2 position included people like Secretary of State Henry Kissinger (1974), Federal Reserve Chairmen Paul Volcker and Arthur Burns (each listed multiple years), and U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy (1979). Most of the top ten each year were government officials; occasionally others were included like TV anchormen Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather, Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman David Rockefeller, AFL–CIO leader George Meany, and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. The only woman to make the top ten list was First Lady Rosalynn Carter in 1980.

In addition to these overall top ten persons, the publication also included top persons in each of several fields, including education, business, finance, journalism, and other areas. The survey was discontinued after its 1986 edition.
===Best countries===

The Best Countries rankings are derived from a survey involving close to 17,000 participants from 36 nations, encompassing business executives, educated individuals, and the general populace. David Reibstein, a professor of marketing, remarked that the Best Countries report underscores the significance of a positive international reputation for nations, as it affects commerce, travel, and economic power. He emphasized that the perceptions of countries shape their economies via tourism, investment, and trade, which are essential for gross domestic product (GDP).

=== Best Colleges ===


===Best Global Universities===

In October 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; published its inaugural &quot;Best Global Universities&quot; rankings. &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; noted that &quot;U.S. News&quot; was entering into the international college and university rankings area which was &quot;dominated by three major global university rankings&quot;, namely the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;, the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;, and the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;. Robert Morse, &quot;U.S. News&#x27;s chief data strategist,&quot; said that &quot;it&#x27;s natural for &quot;U.S. News&quot; to get into this space&quot;. He said that &quot;U.S. News&quot; &quot;will also be the first American publisher to enter the global rankings space&quot;.

===Best Hospitals===

Since 1990, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; has compiled Best Hospitals rankings. The rankings are specifically based on a different methodology which looks at difficult (high acuity) cases within 16 specialties including cancer; diabetes and endocrinology; ear, nose, and throat; gastroenterology, geriatrics, gynecology; heart and heart surgery; kidney disorders; neurology and neurosurgery; ophthalmology, orthopedics, psychiatry, pulmonology, rehabilitation, rheumatology, and urology. In addition to rankings for each of these specialties, hospitals that excel in many &quot;U.S. News&quot; areas are ranked in the Honor Roll.

===Best Cars===

Since 2007, &quot;U.S. News&quot; has ranked new and used automobiles. The rankings span over 30 classes of cars, trucks, SUVs, minivans, wagons, and sports cars. Each automobile receives an overall score and a performance, interior, and recommendation score. Scores are based on the critics selected by &quot;U.S. News&quot;, as well as reliability and safety data. &quot;U.S. News&quot; also produces annual &quot;Best Cars for the Money&quot; and &quot;Best Cars for Families&quot; awards across approximately 20 classes of cars, trucks, SUVs, and minivans. Money award winners are derived by combining vehicle price and five-year cost of ownership with the opinion of the automotive press, while family awards are tabulated by combining critics&#x27; opinions with the vehicle&#x27;s availability of family-friendly features and interior space, as well as safety and reliability data. Money and family award winners are announced in February and March of each year, respectively.

===Best States===
In 2017, &quot;U.S. News&quot; published its first ranking of all 50 U.S. states, incorporating metrics in seven categories: health care, education, crime and corrections, infrastructure, opportunity, economy, and government. The weighting of the individual categories in determining overall rank was informed by surveys on what matters most to residents. Massachusetts occupied the top rank, and Louisiana ranked worst.

In 2018, the eight categories were: health care, education, economy, opportunity, infrastructure, crime and corrections, fiscal stability, and quality of life. Iowa was ranked first, and Louisiana ranked worst. In 2019, natural environment replaced the quality of life category. Washington occupied the top rank, and Louisiana ranked worst.

No ranking was published in 2020. In 2021, Washington, Minnesota, and Utah topped the list; New Mexico, Mississippi, and Louisiana were ranked as the worst.

<text>Solomon Dodashvili (), also known as Solomon Ivanovich Dodaev-Mogarsky () (May 17, 1805 – August 20, 1836), was a Georgian philosopher, journalist, historian, grammarian, belletrist and enlightener.

Dodashvili was born in Magharo, Kakheti, Georgia, then part of Imperial Russia. Having graduated from St Petersburg University in 1827, he obtained a Magister degree in philosophy there in 1828. During his stay in the Russian capital, he was close to Decembrist ideas and witnessed their 1825 mutiny. In 1828, Dodashvili returned to Tiflis, where he worked as an educator. He composed histories, grammars, and summaries of philosophy for his young pupils and led them into political opposition to the Russian rule. His idealistic pedagogues influenced many Georgian intellectuals and poets, including Nikoloz Baratashvili, who combined modern nationalism with European Romanticism. At the same time, from 1828 to 1832, he edited the first Georgian-language literary magazine &quot;Tp’ilisis utsk’ebani&quot;, a weekly addition to the Russian &quot;Tiflisskie Vedomosti&quot;.

His career was terminated by the failure of the 1832 conspiracy against the Russian hegemony, in which he was a participant. Unlike most of his coconspirators, who seconded the restoration of Georgian monarchy, he proposed a republic as a form of government. Arrested by police, he was deported to Russia proper. He was kept in captivity in Vyatka and died there of tuberculosis. He was reburied to Mtatsminda Pantheon, Tbilisi, in 1994.

<doc id="449839" wikidata="Q6382907" url="?curid=449839" title="Keeneland">
<text>Keeneland Association, Inc. is an equine business based in Lexington, Kentucky. It includes two distinct divisions: the Keeneland Race Course, a Thoroughbred racing facility, and Keeneland Sales, a horse auction complex. It is also known for its reference library.

In 2009, the Horseplayers Association of North America introduced a rating system for 65 Thoroughbred racetracks in North America. Keeneland was ranked #1 of the top ten tracks. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

==History==
Keeneland originated as a nonprofit racing–auction entity on of farmland west of Lexington, which had been owned by Jack Keene, a driving force behind the building of the facility. It has used proceeds from races and its auctions to further the thoroughbred industry as well as to contribute to the surrounding community.
Keeneland Race Course has conducted live race meets in April and October since 1936. The 15-day spring meet is one of the richest in North America, with fifteen graded stakes races featuring the Blue Grass Stakes, a prep race for the Kentucky Derby. The 17-day fall meet features seventeen graded stakes races, six of which are Grade One events used as Breeders&#x27; Cup preps.

Keeneland takes pride in maintaining racing traditions; it was the last track in North America to broadcast race calls over its public-address system, not doing so until 1997. Most of the racing scenes of the 2003 movie &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; were shot at Keeneland, in part because of the track&#x27;s &quot;retro feel&quot;. Keeneland was also used in the 2005 movie &quot;Dreamer&quot; and the 2010 movie &quot;Secretariat&quot; for several key scenes, including the running of the Belmont Stakes where the horse completes the Triple Crown.

Nonetheless, Keeneland has adopted several innovations. In 1984 in preparation for a visit by Queen Elizabeth II, it built a trackside Winner&#x27;s Circle and created the Queen Elizabeth II Challenge Cup Stakes. In 1985, it installed a turf course over which the Challenge Cup, as well as a number of other turf races, is now run. It reshaped the main track and replaced the dirt surface with the proprietary Polytrack surface over the summer of 2006 in time for its fall race meeting. The track was restored to a dirt racing surface during the summer of 2014.

Keeneland was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, for its role in the growth of the horseracing sport and its revitalization in Lexington.

Keeneland hosted the Breeders&#x27; Cup for the first time in 2015. The Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic was won by Triple Crown winner American Pharoah by six and a half lengths. He became the first to win the unofficial Grand Slam of horse racing; winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes and Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic. Many horse industry personnel were skeptical of Keeneland as a suitable venue because the track and town were too small to host such a large event. However it was a huge success and even had a Thoroughbred Daily News writer report &quot;I was wrong...it was spectacular&quot; and how he &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more impressed&quot;. In August 2018 Keeneland was named as the host of the 2020 Breeders&#x27; Cup.

In 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Keeneland cancelled their Spring meeting which was to be held from 2 April 2020 to 24 April 2020 and moved their meet to a shortened five day period from 8 July 2020 to 12 July 2020. Five stakes race were not scheduled: Bewitch Stakes, Ben Ali Stakes, Commonwealth Stakes, Doubledogdare Stakes and Lexington Stakes. The Breeders&#x27; Cup was won by Authentic, which had won the Kentucky Derby.

Keeneland participates with Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association (TOBA), i.e., thoroughbred owners &amp; breeders, professionals, and others who support and promote Thoroughbred ownership (and sponsorship), such as through networking and a high level of education.

==Keeneland Sales==
Keeneland is the world&#x27;s largest Thoroughbred auction house, conducting three sales annually: The September Yearling Sale, November Breeding Stock Sale, and January Horses of All Ages Sale. Horses sold at Keeneland sales include 82 horses that won 88 Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championship races; 19 Kentucky Derby winners; 21 Preakness winners; 18 Belmont winners; 11 recipients of the Eclipse Award as Horse of the Year; and five Epsom Derby winners. Graduates of Keeneland sales. The Keeneland Team travels to over 25 countries and invests in over $700,000 annually towards international market development to deliver the world&#x27;s deepest buying bench. The auctions have sold horses to owners worldwide that have won large-scale races. Nine of the 14 highest ranked horses in the Kentucky Oaks were sold in sales through Keeneland.

==Layout==

The track has a dirt oval and a seven and one-half furlong () turf oval. The turf course uses two configurations: the Keeneland Course setup has a temporary rail set out, while the Haggin Course has no temporary rail.

* Katie Mikolay Gensler (2013–present)

==Keeneland Mark of Distinction==

Since 1968 Keeneland has honored the contributions of individuals to both Keeneland itself and the Thoroughbred industry with the Mark of Distinction. Recipients of the honor are given a button that bears the colors of their racing or farm silks. Each spring and fall, members of the Keeneland Club wear the button.

<text>Frederick Donald Coggan, Baron Coggan, (9 October 1909 – 17 May 2000) was the 101st Archbishop of Canterbury from 1974 to 1980. As Archbishop of Canterbury, he &quot;revived morale within the Church of England, opened a dialogue with Rome and supported women&#x27;s ordination&quot;. He had previously been successively the Bishop of Bradford and the Archbishop of York.

== Childhood and education ==
Donald Coggan (he dropped the name Frederick) was born on 9 October 1909 at 32 Croftdown Road, Highgate, Middlesex, the youngest child of Cornish Arthur Coggan, at one time national president of the Federation of Meat Traders and mayor of St Pancras, London, and his wife, Fanny Sarah Chubb.

Cornish Arthur Coggan &quot;seems to have taken little interest in his family&quot;. Therefore, their three children were raised by their mother. During the First World War she took them to Burnham-on-Sea, in Somerset, for safety. It was there that young Donald was influenced by Ashley King, an evangelist who conducted missions for children on the beach. After the war ended, the family returned to London, but &quot;the strains and stresses of the family’s life were so great that Donald became physically ill.&quot; This illness rendered him unable to attend school. Therefore, Donald was taught by a neighbour for four years. The neighbour helped Donald &quot;develop what was to become a life-long love of music.&quot;

===Early education===
At the age of 14, Coggan was well enough to enter Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood. After his confirmation in 1924, he felt drawn to ordination. &quot;His sisters had encouraged him by introducing him to an evangelical church, and these early influences never left him.&quot; At school Coggan studied Latin, Greek and Hebrew seriously.

===Cambridge===
Having shown an unusual aptitude for languages, Coggan was awarded an open exhibition to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He entered St John&#x27;s College in 1928 with an open exhibition, but he was so studious that it was later upgraded to a full scholarship. He was outstanding in oriental languages, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Syriac, and won a first in both parts of the Tripos examinations in 1930 and 1931. He won the Tyrwhitt Hebrew Scholarship, the Mason Hebrew Prize, and the Jeremie Septuagint Prize.

During his time in Cambridge, Coggan helped found a branch of the Christian Union, an evangelical student movement. He also joined the Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union, serving as treasurer and vice-president. He became a member of the executive committee of the Inter-Varsity Fellowship.

Coggan &quot;graduated with an impressive double first&quot;. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1931 and a Master of Arts degree in 1932.

On graduating from Cambridge in 1931, Coggan decided to postpone preparation for ordination for three years. During that time he was an assistant lecturer in Semitic languages and Literature at the University of Manchester. There, he served on the board of management of the Manchester City Mission, and also edited the Inter-Varsity Fellowship magazine.

===Oxford===
In 1934, Coggan went to Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, to prepare for ordination. The next year he married Jean Strain. She was the daughter of a London surgeon and a member of the administrative staff of the Inter-Varsity Fellowship. The couple lived in modest circumstances. They both shared in pastoral and evangelistic work in the parish.

The couple later had two children: (Dorothy) Ann Coggan (1938–2004) and Ruth Evelyn Coggan (born 1940).

== Curate and professor ==
As a youth, his mother took Coggan to an evangelical parish church in Upper Holloway. He remained &quot;within the evangelical tradition&quot; the rest of his life.

Coggan served as a curate in the evangelical St Mary&#x27;s Church, Islington, from 1934 to 1937. He was ordained a priest in 1935.

===Canada===
From 1937 to 1944, Coggan served as Professor of New Testament studies and Dean of Residence at Wycliffe College in Toronto. During those years, he helped &quot;restore the reputation of the college after a period of serious decline&quot;. Coggan spoke and preached in many places.

While in Canada, Coggan developed an interest in the theology and teaching of preaching and set up &quot;schools of preaching&quot;. During that time, although an evangelical, meaning &quot;a love of the Bible and a missionary dynamic&quot;, he dropped his &quot;more fundamentalist attitudes&quot;.

Jean Coggan accompanied her husband to Canada. During their &quot;happy years in Canada&quot;, Jean give birth to two daughters, Ann in 1938 and Ruth in 1940.

Wycliffe College awarded Coggan a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1941, and an honorary Doctorate of Divinity in 1944.

== College principal (1944–1956) ==
Coggan returned to England in 1944 as principal of the London College of Divinity until he became a bishop in 1956. He was invited to be a vice-president of the Inter-Varsity Fellowship. But, in spite of his previous work in the organisation, he declined because he could no longer state a belief in the Bible as &quot;infallible&quot;. In addition to serving as principal, Coggan served as Macneil Professor of Biblical Exegesis from 1952 until he left.

When Coggan became principal, the college buildings at Highbury had been bombed by the Germans, and there were only a few students in residence. A new building was planned at Northwood, London. In the meantime, Coggan had to restore the college by using a manor house in Sussex. He recruited a gifted staff and imposed a strict regime. Under Coggan&#x27;s leadership, the college &quot;became one of the Church of England&#x27;s most highly regarded theological colleges&quot;.

In addition to serving as principal and professor, Coggan served as a proctor in the Convocation (the fore-runner of the General Synod) for the Diocese of London from 1950 to 1956, as an examining chaplain in the Diocese of Lincoln from 1946 to 1956, the Diocese of Manchester from 1951 to 1956, the Diocese of Southwark from 1954 to 1956 the Diocese of Chester from 1955 to 1956.

When Coggan returned to England, wartime constraints on travel meant that his wife and their two children had to remain in Toronto temporarily. When the family returned, the situation was &quot;appalling&quot;. Coggan was &quot;permanently on duty&quot; during the college&#x27;s reconstruction, and the family&#x27;s living conditions were inadequate. Jean &quot;fell ill&quot; as a result of this stress.

Coggan was awarded a Lambeth degree of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) in 1957.

He served as a member of the Board of Governors of Monkton Combe School for nearly fifty years, from 1945 to 1994.

== Bishop of Bradford (1956–1961) ==
Coggan was in great demand as a preacher and lecturer in all parts of the country. Therefore, &quot;it was no surprise when in 1956 the Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, nominated him for the bishopric of the Diocese of Bradford.&quot; The previous bishop, Alfred Blunt, had triggered the King Edward VIII abdication crisis in 1936. From 1931 onwards, Blunt had suffered nervous illnesses, and in 1955 he was forced to retire after a stroke. Therefore, when Coggan became bishop &quot;the life of the diocese was at a low ebb&quot;.

&quot;Coggan swept in with great energy and firm discipline, and in the space of five years organised the building of five new churches and new diocesan offices, the opening of Scargill House - a fine conference and retreat centre at Scargill, and the raising of much money. Parishes were visited, standards were raised, and the new bishop became a popular figure.&quot;

Coggan&#x27;s success as Bishop of Bradford, as it had been in Canada and at the London College of Divinity, demonstrated that he was &quot;thoroughly capable and balanced, colossally hardworking, a scholarly teacher, a fine preacher, and an increasingly irenic personality.&quot;

Coggan was given a Doctor of Divinity (honorary) by the University of Leeds in 1958.

While Coggan served as Bishop of Bradford, he became a world vice-president of the United Bible Societies in 1957. He also served as Select Preacher for Oxford University from 1960 to 1961, as Chairman of the Liturgical Commission from 1960 to 1964, and Chairman of the College of Preachers from 1960 to 1980.

== Archbishop of York (1961–1974) ==

Coggan was appointed Archbishop of York in 1961. Before his enthronement, he visited Israel and met with Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion.

Coggan was enthroned on 13 September 1961. &quot;At his 1961 enthronement in York Minster, Coggan’s evangelical friends were surprised that he wore a cope and mitre.

Coggan began his new ministry with the zeal he had shown in Canada and as Principal of the London College of Divinity. However, &quot;his zeal sometimes outstripped his wisdom, and amid a plethora of activity in the diocese, involving the setting up of numerous councils and committees&quot;. After starting something new, Coggan &quot;tended to become preoccupied with yet another initiative, or to find himself required overseas&quot;.

===Overseas===
Coggan visited four continents while at York. He played a leading role in the Anglican Congress in Toronto in 1963.

In 1967, Coggan took a tour to Australia and New Zealand on behalf of the United Bible Societies. He &quot;filled public halls and cathedrals with his lectures on the place of the Bible in modern society&quot;. He also visited the British armed forces bases in Singapore and Borneo, meeting with senior officers, leading retreats, and teaching schools for service chaplains.

In 1970, Coggan led a Canadian Congress on Evangelism. In 1971, he went to Belgium to meet Cardinal Suenens.

===At home===
At home, Coggan was chairman of the Church of England&#x27;s recently formed Liturgical Commission. He also served as Pro-Chancellor of the University of York from 1962 to 1974, as Pro-Chancellor of Hull University from 1968 to 1974, as President of the Society for Old Testament Study from 1967, as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom from 1961 until his retirement in 1980 by virtue of his office, as the Shaftesbury Lecturer in 1973, and as Prelate of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (1967–91).

He played a leading role in the Lambeth Conference of 1968.

The then Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, once said that Coggan was &quot;like a man with a wheelbarrow; however much you pile on him, he goes on pushing&quot;.

Coggan&#x27;s concern &quot;with Scripture translations, exegesis and preaching dominated his mind&quot; His &quot;interest in Biblical translation persisted in his ministry – he was actively involved in the preparation of new, clear and usable translations of biblical texts, including the New English Bible (1961) and the Revised English Bible (published in 1989)&quot;. He was chairman of the Joint Committee responsible for the translation of the New English Bible (1970). and chairman of the Joint Committee responsible for the translation of the Revised English Bible (1989).

Coggan was &quot;in great demand as a preacher and lecturer in all parts of the country&quot;. Not only was Coggan in demand as a preacher and lecturer, his wife Jean was also. As a lay reader at York, she conducted services and preached. In addition, she was &quot;a popular speaker, and much in demand&quot;.

Coggan was awarded a Doctor of Divinity by Cambridge University in 1962 and a Doctor of Divinity by the University of Hull in 1963.

===Established new programmes===
Coggan began Opportunity Unlimited. The programme served to encourage the parishes in prayer, teaching, and visiting. There were &quot;the three planks on which Coggan believed the parochial ministry to be based&quot;.

Coggan &quot;founded, and energetically promoted, Feed the Minds, an ecumenical programme for providing Christian literature to the third world&quot;. He also founded the English College of Preachers, based on a similar organization in the USA.

In these new ventures Coggan found assistants of real calibre. John Hunter, Alec Gilmore, and Douglas Cleverley Ford. David Blunt, Coggan&#x27;s lay chaplain, the son of his predecessor in the Diocese of Bradford, was a key person in all of Coggan&#x27;s activities.

Coggan&#x27;s appointments of three suffragan bishops were also highly successful: George Snow, Douglas Sargent, and Hubert Higgs &quot;all provided thoughtful loyalty and stimulating companionship&quot;. The theologian Alan Richardson, who was dean of York Minster, became a close friend and confidant.

In the early 1960s, Coggan expressed his support for the ordination of women. He formally proposed it at the Lambeth Conference in 1968&quot;. Coggan also &quot;pressed repeatedly&quot; for inter-communion with the Roman Catholic Church

In 1967, Coggan was awarded a Doctor of Letters by the Westminster Choir College and a Doctor of Sacred Theology by the General Theological Seminary. While in North America, Coggan addressed The Empire Club of Canada in Toronto on 1 June 1967. His speech was titled “The East, The West and the Bible”.

In 1972, Coggan demonstrated his abhorrence to racial intolerance by opening the Bishop&#x27;s Palace in York to an Asian family that had been forced to leave Uganda. He opposed apartheid in South African and was a sponsor of a &quot;No Arms for South Africa&quot; campaign along.&quot;

The University of Manchester awarded Coggan a Doctor of Divinity degree in 1972.

Regarding homosexuality, in 1973 Coggan said on BBC radio that many Anglican clergymen were homosexuals. &quot;We must treat them,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot;with great sympathy and understanding.&quot;

Coggan was &quot;often described as the laymen&#x27;s archbishop. He made friends easily with business leaders and workers alike. He was perhaps less at ease with the landed gentry of the Yorkshire farms and wolds, but they warmed to him for his active support of the York Civic Trust.&quot;

More than anything else, &quot;it was the energy, compassion, and integrity of Coggan himself&quot; that made for his success at York. His preaching would often take &quot;a single Greek word and open up its meaning, leaving laity enlightened and encouraged and clergy thirsting for more study&quot;.

== Archbishop of Canterbury (1974–1980) ==
In 1974, on the recommendation of the British prime minister, Harold Wilson (himself a Congregationalist), Coggan was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II as the 101st Archbishop of Canterbury. Coggan &quot;agonized four days before accepting Wilson’s recommendation&quot;. &quot;The prime minister wanted a quick answer, and I knew I was keeping him waiting&quot;, said Coggan, &quot;but I wanted to be sure I was ready to do the job.&quot;

As primate-elect, Coggan had his first meeting with the media at Church House, Westminster. He was questioned about being only a &quot;caretaker primate&quot; (He was already 65 and would have to retire at age 70.). He answered that &quot;he would regard it as an honour to take care of his beloved church for five or whatever number of years&quot;.

Coggan was invested as the Archbishop of Canterbury in December 1974. He was enthroned on 24 January 1975 at Canterbury Cathedral.

Coggan&#x27;s enthronement was &quot;the most ecumenical enthronement ever held&quot;. For the first time since the English Reformation, the Vatican was represented. There was also &quot;participation by Orthodox patriarchs, leaders of the Methodists and other Free Churches, Quakers, denominational leaders from all over the world, and heads of Anglican churches in full communion with Canterbury.&quot;

===Active administrator===
In York, Coggan had undertaken &quot;a formidable programme of activity&quot;, even for a man of his &quot;energy and discipline&quot;. Thus, when his translation to Canterbury was announced &quot;some feared that he might be close to exhaustion&quot;. However, he was &quot;a much more active Primate than his predecessor Michael Ramsey&quot;. Ramsey spent his 13 years as Archbishop of Canterbury trying to avoid administration. In contrast, Coggan was not only a scholarly theologian, but, as a &quot;company director&quot; would, he kept &quot;a tape recorder handy for prompt dictation&quot;.

Being the Archbishop of Canterbury requires administration because it entails four jobs: (1) bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury; (2) Metropolitan of the Province of Canterbury; (3) titular head of the Anglican Communion; and (4) chief chaplain to &quot;the mixed pickles of church and state&quot;.

In 1975, Coggan was made a fellow of King&#x27;s College London in 1975.

===&quot;Call to the Nation&quot;===
Coggan broadcast a &quot;Call to the Nation&quot; in 1975. He argued that &quot;economic regeneration had to be accompanied by moral regeneration&quot;. In the broadcast he said,Many are realizing that a materialistic answer is no real answer at all. There are moral and spiritual issues at stake. The truth is that we in Britain are without anchors. We are drifting. A common enemy in two world wars drew us together in united action – and we defeated him. Another enemy is at the gates today, and we keep silence.

In broadcasting the &quot;Call to the Nation&quot;, Coggan was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to attempt to communicate &quot;en masse&quot; beyond the church. Around 28,000 people wrote letters to Coggan in response to his broadcast. The letters included those that addressed the primate as &quot;Dear Lord&quot; as &quot;Your Grace, Chief Godman&quot;. For a time, the call &quot;aroused widespread interest, but its long-term impact was negligible&quot;.

===Ordination of women===
In the early 1960s, Coggan had expressed his support for the ordination of women. He formally proposed it at the Lambeth Conference in 1968. Other bishops had joined Coggan in pushing for the ordination of women but the conference affirmed that &quot;the theological arguments&quot; for and against it are &quot;inconclusive&quot;.

===Evangelism===
Coggan was described as an &quot;evangelist of zeal&quot;. As such, in 1976 he convened a meeting for &#x27;all who were seeking a way forward in evangelism on a national scale&#x27; As a result of this meeting, the &#x27;Nationwide Initiative in Evangelism&#x27; (NIE) was born.

The NIE was described &quot;as unique in that it represents the first united and positive action in evangelism since the Reformation&quot;. The NIE was officially dedicated at a service in the chapel of Lambeth Palace in January 1979. Leaders of churches involved were present, including the Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster. The NIE did not catch the imagination of Christians around the country. By June 1980 only 200 had booked to attend the Assembly in September 1980 instead of the anticipated 2,000.&quot;

Coggan founded the Lord Coggan Memorial Fund which helped to supply Russian children with copies of the Bible.
===Ecumenism===
Coggan tried &quot;to make ecumenical progress with other churches&quot;. He &quot;pressed repeatedly&quot; for intercommunion with the Roman Catholic Church.

In 1977, during a visit to Rome, Coggan called for full intercommunion between the Anglican Communion and the Roman Catholic Church, taking his hosts completely by surprise.

The visit to Rome took place during an ecumenical tour in which Coggan also went to see the Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul and the General Secretary of the World Council of Churches in Geneva.

Coggan attended the enthronement in 1978 of Pope John Paul II, the first Archbishop of Canterbury to be present at such a ceremony since the Reformation.

Reaching out to other faiths, Coggan supported the Council of Christians and Jews.

===1976 Anglican Consultative Council===
In 1976, Coggan attended the Anglican Consultative Council meeting in Trinidad from 23 March to 2 April as ex officio president. That meeting was only one of the destinations for Coggan who &quot;travelled more miles than any of his predecessors&quot;.

Other destinations on the 1976 trip included Pakistan and India. In India, Coggan visited the memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, an old people&#x27;s home, and the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi.

===1977 World Council of Churches===
In 1977, Coggan and his wife attended the 5th Assembly of the World Council of Churches in Nairobi, Kenya. The youth delegates stayed in a college hostel where they slept in bunk beds. Rather than stay in a fine hotel, Coggan and his wife stayed in the college hostel.

===1978 Lambeth Conference===
Coggan hosted the 1978 Lambeth Conference. For the first time, the Conference was held in Canterbury on the campus of the University of Kent at Canterbury where every subsequent Conference has been held.

Coggan&#x27;s &quot;relaxed manner and personal interaction with many of the participants&quot; contributed to its success. He was known for his warm welcome and once remarked that &quot;the art of hospitality is to make guests feel at home when you wish they were&quot;. The tone of the conference allowed &quot;the anxieties and concerns of the bishops&quot; to be aired. The conference &quot;helped to bring a new coherence to the Anglican Communion&quot;.

Coggan also invited bishops to bring their wives, who formed a &quot;separate conference&quot;. Jean Coggan was in charge of a committee making arrangements for a conference for bishops&#x27; wives. The conference for wives was held at Christ Church College Canterbury on 5–13 August.

===Nearing retirement===
Throughout Coggan&#x27;s primacy, his &quot;wholesome humanity had run like a golden thread&quot;. &quot;The joy of being a priest&quot;, he said, &quot;is that your work never ends until they carry you out. Then another begins – that&#x27;s elsewhere.&quot;

During his primacy, Coggan had &quot;preached more sermons and travelled more miles than any other of his predecessors&quot;.

== Retirement and death ==
Coggan retired on 25 January 1980 at the age of seventy. After Coggan&#x27;s retirement, he and his wife moved to Sissinghurst in Kent where he had been appointed Assistant Bishop in Canterbury Diocese. He and Lady Coggan moved after some years to Winchester. During his retirement, he received awards and was active in ways that included the following:
*In retirement, Coggan &quot;continued to sally forth, preaching and lecturing far and wide&quot;. When not so engaged, he regularly attended the Church of St Swithun&#x27;s, Winchester where he sometimes accompanied services, playing the piano, surely the only Archbishop ever to have done so. He is commemorated there by his initials carved on a bench-end.
*On 28 January 1980, he was granted a life peerage and made &quot;The Most Revd &amp; Rt Hon. Baron Coggan, &quot;of Canterbury and Sissinghurst in the County of Kent&quot;.
*On 13 February 1980, he was awarded the Royal Victorian Chain.
*From 1980 to 1988, he served as Assistant Bishop in the Diocese of Canterbury.
*In 1981, he was elected the first Life President of the Church Army.
*From 1983 to 1987, he served as chairman of the executive committee and as a vice-president of the Council of Christians and Jews.&quot;
*In 1987, he was invited to the Vatican to help set &quot;Guidelines for Interconfessional Cooperation in Translating the Bible the New Revised Edition Rome&quot;.
*He served as Chairman of the Church of England&#x27;s Catechism Commission, and Chairman of the Church of England&#x27;s Psalter Revision Commission.

Coggan died at the Old Parsonage Nursing Home, Main Road, Otterbourne, near Winchester, on 17 May 2000, survived by his wife. His funeral service, followed by cremation, was held at St Swithun&#x27;s, Winchester, on 26 May 2000. A memorial service was held in Winchester Cathedral on 30 June 2000. Coggan&#x27;s ashes are interred in the cloister garden of Canterbury Cathedral.

Coggan&#x27;s wife Jean (Lady Coggan, died 2005) played an important supporting role in his ministry. They had two daughters: Ruth Coggan, formerly a missionary doctor of the Church Missionary Society in Pakistan, and Ann Coggan, formerly a teacher at The Pilgrims&#x27; School, Winchester.

<text>Baron Zouche is a title which has been created three times, all in the Peerage of England.

==Genealogy==

The la Zouche family descended from Alan la Zouche (d. 1190), lord of the manor of North Molton in North Devon, England, originally called Alain de Porhoët, or Ceoche, who was a Breton nobleman who settled in England during the reign of King Henry II (1154–1189). He was the son of Viscount Geoffrey de Porhoët and Hawise (of unknown origins). 

Alan married Adeline (or Alice) de Belmeis, daughter of Phillip de Belmeis and Maud la Meschine, who died at North Molton in 1190. By his marriage he obtained the manor of Ashby in Leicestershire (called after him Ashby-de-la-Zouch). His son was Roger la Zouche (c. 1175 – bef. 14 May 1238) who was the father of Alan la Zouche (1205–1270) and Eudo (or Odo) la Zouche.

===Alan la Zouche and the Barony of Ashby===

Alan (1205–1270) was justice of Chester and justice of Ireland under King Henry III (1216–1272). He was loyal to the king during his struggle with the barons, fought at the Battle of Lewes and helped to arrange the Peace of Kenilworth. As the result of a quarrel over some lands with John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, he was seriously injured in Westminster Hall by the earl and his retainers and died on 10 August 1270. Alan&#x27;s grandson from the marriage of his son Roger to Ela Longespée, namely Alan la Zouche, was summoned by writ to Parliament on 6 February 1299 as Baron la Zouche of Ashby. He was Governor of Rockingham Castle and Steward of Rockingham Forest. However, this barony fell into abeyance on his death in 1314 without male progeny.

===Eudo la Zouche and the Barony of Haryngworth===

Eudo was a professional soldier; late in life, he married Millicent de Cantilupe (d. 1299), one of the two sisters and co-heiresses of Sir George de Cantilupe (1251–1273), 4th feudal baron of Eaton Bray and Lord of Abergavenny, from whom he inherited several manors including Eaton Bray, Calne and Harringworth and by whom he had three daughters and two sons. Their elder son William la Zouche was summoned by writ to Parliament as Baron Zouche of Haryngworth, on 16 August 1308. His great-great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron, married Alice Seymour, 6th Baroness St Maur, and assumed that peerage in her right. Their son succeeded to both titles; his stepmother, Elizabeth St. John, was an aunt of the future King Henry VII, a connection which proved useful to later members of the family. The seventh Baron was attainted in 1485 for loyalty to King Richard III but was eventually restored to his title and a part of his lands. On the death in 1625 of Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, 12th Baron St Maur, the peerages fell into abeyance between Edward&#x27;s two daughters, Elizabeth and Mary.

====Revival of the Barony of Zouche of Haryngworth====

In 1815 the Barony of Zouche was called out of abeyance in favour of Cecil Bishopp, 8th Baronet (d. 1828), of Parham Park, who became the 12th Baron Zouche. Through his mother Susanna Hedges he was a descendant of Elizabeth la Zouche. 

Cecil&#x27;s eldest son Lieutenant-Colonel Cecil Bisshopp (d. 1813) pre-deceased his father at age 30 in Ontario, Canada, from wounds received in action against the Americans in the War of 1812. With the deaths of both this Cecil and another son, Lieutenant Charles-Cecil Bisshopp, the Barony of Zouche once again fell into abeyance in 1828. 

In 1829, the abeyance was terminated in favour of the 12th baron Cecil&#x27;s elder daughter, Harriet-Anne Curzon (née Bisshopp), who became the 13th Baroness. She was the wife of Robert Curzon, younger son of Assheton Curzon, 1st Viscount Curzon. 

Harriet-Anne and Robert&#x27;s son, the Honourable Robert Curzon, became the 14th Baron. He was notable for his collection of Coptic manuscripts (also known as the White Monastery manuscripts) which were bequeathed by his daughter Darea (in 1917) the 16th Baroness to the British Museum. On Robert&#x27;s death the title first passed to a son, Robert Nathaniel Cecil George Curzon the 15th Baron, and then to a daughter, the aforementioned Darea. 

Darea never married and was succeeded by her second cousin, Mary Cecil Frankland the 17th Baroness, who was the granddaughter of a younger son of the 13th Baroness. 

Mary was succeeded by her grandson, James Assheton Frankland the 18th Baron, who in 1944 had already succeeded his father as the 12th Frankland Baronet of Thirkleby. James&#x27;s son, William Thomas Assheton Frankland (born 23 July 1984), succeeded as the 19th Baron Zouche and 13th Baronet Frankland of Thirkleby in September 2022.

===The Barony Zouche of Mortimer===

A granddaughter of the original Alan la Zouche, Joyce la Zouche, married Robert Mortimer of Richard&#x27;s Castle; one of her younger sons, William la Zouche, adopted his maternal surname of la Zouche and bought the reversion of the manor of Ashby-de-la-Zouch from Alan in 1304, the latter to hold it until his death (1314). On 26 December 1323, he was created by writ Baron Zouche of Mortimer. This peerage became abeyant in 1406.

<text>Hypericum is a genus of flowering plants in the family Hypericaceae (formerly considered a subfamily of Clusiaceae). The genus has a nearly worldwide distribution, missing only from tropical lowlands, deserts and polar regions. Many &quot;Hypericum&quot; species are regarded as invasive species and noxious weeds. All members of the genus may be referred to as St. John&#x27;s wort, and some are known as goatweed. The white or pink flowered marsh St. John&#x27;s worts of North America and eastern Asia are generally accepted as belonging to the separate genus &quot;Triadenum&quot; 

&quot;Hypericum&quot; is unusual for a genus of its size because a worldwide taxonomic monograph was produced for it by Norman Robson (working at the Natural History Museum, London). Robson recognizes 36 sections within &quot;Hypericum&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Hypericum&quot; species are quite variable in habit, occurring as trees, shrubs, annuals, and perennials. Trees in the sense of single stemmed woody plants are rare, as most woody species have multiple stems arising from a single base. Shrubs have erect or spreading stems but never root from nodes that touch the ground. However, perennial herbs tend to root from these horizontal nodes, especially those that occur in wet habitats. Annual herbs tend to have taproots with a developed system of secondary hair roots. Many species of &quot;Hypericum&quot; are completely glabrous, others have simple uniseriate hairs, and some species have long, fine hairs.
Two types of glands form the characteristic punctiform patterns of &quot;Hypericum&quot;, &quot;dark glands&quot; and &quot;pale glands&quot;. Dark glands consist of clusters of cells with a distinct black to reddish color. Their hue is indicative of a presence of naphthodianthrone, either hypericin or pseudohypericin, or both. These glands occur in about two-thirds of &quot;Hypericum&quot; sections and are usually restricted to certain organs. When these glands are crushed, the naphthodianthrones give a red stain. Paracelsus called the red secretions &quot;Johannes-blut&quot; in the 16th century, linking the plant to the martyr St. John and giving rise to the English and German common names of &quot;St. John&#x27;s wort&quot;. The pale glands, forming the pellucid dots, are each a intracellular space lined with flattened cells that secrete oils and phloroglucinol derivates, including hyperforin. The distribution of these hypericin glands dissuades generalist herbivores from feeding on the plants. When generalist insects feed on &quot;Hypericum perforatum&quot;, 30-100% more naphthodianthrones are produced, repelling the insects.
The four thin ridges of tissue along the stems are closely to the opposite-decussate leaves of &quot;Hypericum&quot;. The ridges can be minor, just being called &quot;ridges&quot;, or prominent, being called &quot;wings&quot;. Terete, two-lined, and six-lined stems can occur occasionally. When a species has a tree or shrub habit, the internodes become mostly terete with age, though some trace of lines can still be detected in mature plants. The number of lines is an important distinguishing characteristic; for example, &quot;H. perforatum&quot; and &quot;Hypericum maculatum&quot; are easily confused save for &quot;H. perforatum&quot; having two lines and &quot;H. maculatum&quot; having four. The pale and dark glands are present on stems of various species, and other various species have stems without any glands. In section &quot;Hypericum&quot;, the glands are only present on stem lines, and in other sections, including &quot;Origanifolia&quot; and &quot;Hirtella&quot;, the glands are distributed across the stems.

Nearly all leaves of &quot;Hypericum&quot; species are arranged opposite and decussate, an exception being section &quot;Coridium&quot; in which whorls of three to four leaves occur. The leaves lack stipules and can be sessile or shortly petiolar, though long petioles exist in sections &quot;Adenosepalum&quot; and &quot;Hypericum&quot;. Basal articulation can be present, in which case leaves are deciduous above the articulation, or absent, in which case the leaves are persistent. Some species in sections &quot;Campylosporus&quot; and &quot;Brathys&quot; have an auricle-like, reflexed leaf base, whereas true auricles only exist in sections &quot;Drosocarpium&quot;, &quot;Thasia&quot;, and &quot;Crossophyllum&quot;. Laminar venation is highly variable, being dichotomous to pinnate to densely reticulate. Leaves are typically ovoid to elongate to linear in shape. Leaves are typically shorter than the internodes. Pale or dark glands can be present on or near the leaf margin and on the main leaf surface.

Typically there are four or five sepals, though in section &quot;Myriandra&quot; there are rarely three. When five sepals are present they are quincuncial, and when four sepals are present they are opposite and decussate. Sepals can be equal or unequal. Sepals can be united at their base, as seen in sections &quot;Hirtella&quot;, &quot;Taeniocarpium&quot;, and &quot;Arthrophyllum&quot;. The margins are variable, having marginal glands, teeth, or hairs. The presence or absence of dark glands on the sepals is a useful distinguishing characteristic.
Almost all &quot;Hypericum&quot; petals are yellow, though a range of color exists from a pale lemony hue to a deep orangish-yellow. Exceptions include the white or pinkish petals of &quot;Hypericum albiflorum&quot; var. &quot;albiflorum&quot; and &quot;H. geminiflorum&quot;. Many species have petals that are lined or tinged with red, including the deep crimson petals of &quot;H. capitatum&quot; var. &quot;capitatum&quot;. Petal lengths can be equal or unequal. The petals are mostly asymmetrical except those of sections &quot;Adenotrias&quot; and &quot;Elodes&quot;. In those two sections, sterile bodies have developed between the stamen fascicles, working as lodicules to spread the petals of the pseudotubular flower, a specialized pollination mechanism. Nearly all species have glands on their petals; only section &quot;Adenotrias&quot; has completely eglandular petals. It has been hypothesized that the intensity of red on the petals is correlated with the hypericin content of the glands, but other pigments including skyrin derivatives can create a red color.

&quot;Hypericum&quot; flowers have four or five fascicles that have, in total, five to two hundred stamens. The fascicles can be free or fused in various ways, often into three apparent fascicles. In sections &quot;Myriandra&quot;, &quot;Brathys&quot;, and some of &quot;Trigynobrathys&quot;, the stamens form a ring. Though stamens are usually persistent, some are deciduous. The stamens have an anther gland on the connective tissue, varying in color from amber to black.

The ovaries are three or five-merous, occasionally two-merous, with a corresponding number of free or united styles. Developing seeds are borne on axile or parietal placentae, with at least two ovules per placenta. &quot;Hypericum&quot; fruits are dissimilar to most of Hypericaceae, being capsular and dehisce from the apex. The capsule can be dry or remain fleshy when mature. The capsules have elongate or punctate glands on their surface that create various shapes and patterns. These glands are typically pale amber, though in section &quot;Drosocarpium&quot; the glands are reddish-black. Extractions of these glands in certain species yielded phloroglucinol and terpenoid derivatives, suggesting a connection between these glands and the pale glands of vegetative tissue. Seeds of &quot;Hypericum&quot; species are small and range in color from a yellowish brown to dark purplish brown. The seeds are cylindric to ellipsoid and may have narrow wings. In some seeds, a basal ridge may be present, and rarely in section &quot;Adenotrias&quot; an apical caruncle is present which attracts ants to disperse seeds. Some species have highly specific germination and survival condition requirements. For example, &quot;H. lloydii&quot; is susceptible to a fungal infection as a seedling if conditions are too moist, whereas other species including &quot;H. chapmanii&quot; can grow underwater.

==Taxonomy==

There are over 490 species in the genus. The name &quot;hypericum&quot; derives from &quot;hypereikos&quot; (variants: &quot;hypereikon&quot; and &quot;hyperikon&quot;), i.e. the Greek name for Hypericum crispum and Hypericum revolutum, itself possibly meaning &quot;above pictures&quot;, for its use over shrines to repel evil spirits, though some have translated it as &quot;above the heath&quot;.

===Sections===
&quot;Hypericum&quot; is broken up into 36 sections, each with its own subsections and species. They include:

*&quot;Adenosepalum&quot;
*&quot;Adenotrias&quot;
*&quot;Androsaemum&quot;
*&quot;Arthrophyllum&quot;
*&quot;Ascyreia&quot;
*&quot;Brathys&quot;
*&quot;Bupleuroides&quot;
*&quot;Campylopus&quot;
*&quot;Concinna&quot;
*&quot;Coridium&quot;
*&quot;Crossophyllum&quot;
*&quot;Drosocarpium&quot;
*&quot;Elodeoida&quot;
*&quot;Graveolentia&quot;
*&quot;Heterophylla&quot;
*&quot;Hirtella&quot;
*&quot;Humifusoideum&quot;

*&quot;Inodora&quot;
*&quot;Monanthama&quot;
*&quot;Myriandra&quot;
*&quot;Oligostema&quot;
*&quot;Olympia&quot;
*&quot;Origanifolia&quot;
*&quot;Psorophytum&quot;
*&quot;Roscyna&quot;
*&quot;Sampsonia&quot;
*&quot;Santomasia&quot;
*&quot;Taeniocarpium&quot;
*&quot;Takasagoya&quot;
*&quot;Triadenoides&quot;
*&quot;Trigynobrathys&quot;
*&quot;Tripentas&quot;
*&quot;Umbraculoides&quot;
*&quot;Webbia&quot;
==Ecology==
&quot;H. perforatum&quot; is an invasive species and noxious weed in farmland and gardens in the humid and sub-humid temperate zones of several continents. It is considered poisonous to livestock.

Part of the invasive success of &quot;Hypericum&quot; species is due to the absence of natural pests. The beetles &quot;Chrysolina quadrigemina&quot;, &quot;Chrysolina hyperici&quot; and the St. John&#x27;s-wort root borer (&quot;Agrilus hyperici&quot;) feed on common St. John&#x27;s-wort (&quot;H. perforatum&quot;) plants and have been used for biocontrol where the plant has become an invasive weed. &quot;Hypericum&quot; species are the only known food plants of the caterpillar of the treble-bar, a species of moth. Other Lepidoptera species whose larvae sometimes feed on &quot;Hypericum&quot; include the common emerald, the engrailed (recorded on imperforate St. John&#x27;s-wort, &quot;H. maculatum&quot;), the grey pug and the setaceous Hebrew character. A leaf beetle, &quot;Paria sellata&quot;, feeds on the foliage of &quot;Hypericum adpressum&quot;, while ant species &quot;Formica montana&quot; and &quot;F. subsericea&quot; decorate their nests with its bright yellow petals. A small, reddish-brown weevil, &quot;Anthonomous rutilus&quot; breeds in the inflorescences of &quot;Hypericum kalmianum&quot; and &quot;H. swinkianum&quot;, the larvae developing within the fruit capsules.

==Traditional medicine and adverse effects==

Common St. John&#x27;s-wort (&quot;H. perforatum&quot;) has long been used in traditional medicine as an extract to treat depression. &quot;H. perforatum&quot; is the most commonly used species – especially in Europe – as an herbal substitute for prescription drugs to treat depression, and is also sold as a dietary supplement. One meta-analysis found that St John&#x27;s wort had similar efficacy and safety as prescriptions drugs to treat mild-to-moderate depression, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

There is evidence that combining St. John’s wort with prescription antidepressants may cause adverse effects, such as a life-threatening increase of serotonin, the brain chemical targeted by some drugs used for depression. Symptoms may include agitation, diarrhea, high blood pressure, and hallucinations. Taking St. John’s wort may interfere with and reduce the efficacy of prescription drugs used to treat depression.

St. John&#x27;s wort interacts with hormonal contraceptives, reducing their effectiveness and increasing the risk of unplanned pregnancy.

==Ornamental plants== 
Some species are used as ornamental plants as many have large, showy flowers. Species found in cultivation include: 

*&quot;H. aegypticum&quot;
*&quot;H. androsaemum&quot;
*&quot;H. balearicum&quot;
*&quot;H. bellum&quot;
*&quot;H. calycinum&quot;
*&quot;H. elodes&quot;
*&quot;H. forrestii&quot;
*&quot;H. kalmianum&quot;
*&quot;H. kouytchense&quot;
*&quot;H. olympicum&quot;
*&quot;H. perforatum&quot;
Numerous hybrids and cultivars have been developed for use in horticulture. The following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
* &quot;H.&quot; × &quot;moserianum&quot; (&quot;H. calycinum&quot; × &quot;H. patulum&quot;)
* &#x27;Hidcote&#x27; 
* &#x27;Rowallane&#x27;

Most species of Hypericum are prone to thrips, scale, anthracnose, rust, and leaf spots. They are also eaten or infected by aphids, white flies, and spodoptera littoralis.

==Fossil record==
The oldest fossil species is †&quot;Hypericum antiquum&quot; from the Eocene of Siberia. Fossil seeds from the early Miocene of †&quot;Hypericum septestum&quot; have been found in the Czech part of the Zittau Basin. Many fossil seeds of †&quot;Hypericum holyi&quot; have been described from middle Miocene strata of the Fasterholt area near Silkeborg in Central Jutland, Denmark.

<doc id="449853" wikidata="Q3194330" url="?curid=449853" title="Kawai Gyokudō">
<text>was the pseudonym of a Japanese painter in the nihonga school, active from Meiji through Shōwa period Japan. His real name was Kawai Yoshisaburō.

== Biography ==
Gyokudō was born in what is now Ichinomiya city, Aichi Prefecture, as the eldest son of a paper, ink and brush merchant. 
In the spring of 1887, he graduated from Gifu Jinji Kogakko Elementary School, and in September, with a letter of introduction from Aoki Senbashi, entered the school of Mochizuki Gyokusen in Kyoto, where he was given the name &quot;Gyokusyu&quot;.
He went to Kyoto in 1887 to study under Kōno Bairei of the Maruyama-Shijo school of painting. 
In 1890, when he exhibited his work at the Industrial Exposition, he changed his name to &quot;Gyokudo&quot; after Gyokusen&#x27;s name Tama and his grandfather&#x27;s name Chikudo.
In 1896, he moved to Tokyo and he became the student of Hashimoto Gahō, of the Kanō school. He also studied Western-style painting and developed a highly personal style, especially in the field of landscape painting.

Gyokudō is noted for his polychrome and occasionally monochrome works depicting the mountains and rivers of Japan in the four seasons, with humans and animals shown as part of the natural landscape. Among his representative works are &quot;Futsuka zuki&quot; (“The New Moon”), &quot;Yuku haru&quot; (“The Departing Spring”), &quot;Mine-no-yu&quot; (“Evening at the Mountain Top”), and &quot;Bosetsu&quot; (“Snow in the Evening”).

In 1898, Gyokudō joined with Okakura Tenshin and Yokoyama Taikan to found the &quot;Nihon Bijutsuin&quot; (Japan Fine Art Academy). In 1907, Gyokudo was selected as a judge for the first annual &quot;Bunten&quot; Exhibition. He became a teacher at the &quot;Tokyo Bijutsu Gakkō&quot; (the forerunner of the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music) in 1919.

Received the region of Honor from the French government in 1931 and the Grand Officer Coulonne from the Emperor of Italy in June.

In October 1933, he was awarded the First Class Honorary Medal of the Red Cross by the German government.

In June 1935, he was appointed a member of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. Awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 3rd class, in November 1935.

In 1952, Kenso-dong organized a three person exhibition of Gyokudo, Taikan and Ryuko.

In 1957, Gyokudo developed heart asthma disease and recuperated, but the disease worsened again in early June and Gyokudo died on the 30th.

In 1940, he was awarded the Order of Culture by the Government of Japan.

Most of his works are preserved and displayed at the Gyokudo Art Museum, in Ōme, Tokyo.

<doc id="449859" wikidata="Q3128092" url="?curid=449859" title="Hashimoto Gahō">
<text>was a Japanese painter, one of the last to paint in the style of the Kanō school. He is also considered the founder of &quot;Nihonga&quot; and was an educator who trained many &quot;Nihonga&quot; painters. Many of the painters recognized in later generations as great &quot;Nihonga&quot; masters, such as Yokoyama Taikan, Shimomura Kanzan, Hishida Shunsō and Kawai Gyokudō, were his students. He was one of the first five painters to be appointed as an Imperial Household Artist and was one of the most authoritative painters in Japan at that time.

== Biography ==

Born in Edo, he was a son of a painter. After studying under his father, he continued his studies with Kanō Shōsen&#x27;in, and was also influenced by the work of Kanō Hōgai. He created many works in the traditional style of the Kanō school, employing color and gold, or otherwise utilizing monochrome black ink. Although his paintings are predominantly traditional, employing traditional methods and depicting traditional subjects, Gahō, like Kanō Hōgai, also incorporated elements of Western art. Brushstrokes, various types of detailing, and particularly attempts at proper depiction of perspective are evident in Gahō&#x27;s paintings and in many others of this period.

His talent led him to become a studio director at the age of 22 and he was placed in charge of his master&#x27;s school. Due to the political and economic upheavals surrounding the Meiji Restoration, he was compelled to seek income beyond selling fine art. He produced maps for the Naval Academy, painted on fans exported to China, and utilized his skills in various other ways to earn a living. 

Following a revival of interest in Japanese painting during the 1880s, he twice won a prize at the government-sponsored picture exhibitions which led him to become famous. Gahō was invited in 1884, by Okakura Kakuzō, to become the chief professor of painting at the &quot;Tōkyō Bijutsu Gakkō&quot; (東京美術学校, now the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music) which would open five years later. His students included Kawai Gyokudō and Yokoyama Taikan who would become future masters of Japanese painting. In 1898, Gahō joined Okakura in leaving the Bijutsu Gakkō, and founding the Japan Fine Arts Academy (日本美術院, &quot;Nihon Bijutsuin&quot;). He would teach there until his death in 1908.

As a result of his position as chief painting professor, Gahō had a number of important pupils, including Yokoyama Taikan and Kawai Gyokudō.

<doc id="449863" wikidata="Q4862883" url="?curid=449863" title="Baron Vaux of Harrowden">
<text>Baron Vaux of Harrowden is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1523 for Sir Nicholas Vaux. The barony was created by writ, which means that it can pass through both male and female lines. Vaux was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was a poet and member of the courts of Henry VIII and Edward VI. The Vaux family was related to Queen Consort Katherine Parr by the first baron&#x27;s two wives; Elizabeth FitzHugh and Anne Green (sister to Lady Maud Parr). On the death in 1663 of his great-grandson, the fifth Baron, the title fell into abeyance between the late Baron&#x27;s surviving sister Joyce, and the heirs of his deceased sisters Mary, Lady Symeon, and Catherine, Baroness Abergavenny.

The Vaux family owned Great Harrowden Hall until 1695 when they sold it to Thomas Watson-Wentworth, of Rockingham Castle, the hall was rebuilt in 1719.

The barony remained in abeyance for 175 years, until the abeyance was terminated in 1838 in favour of George Charles Mostyn, who became the sixth Baron. He was the son of Mary Lucinda Browne-Mostyn, a descendant of Mary, the eldest sister of the fifth Baron, by her marriage to Charles Mostyn, grandson of Sir Edward Mostyn, 5th Baronet (see Mostyn Baronets, of Talacre). He was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Baron. He was in the Diplomatic Service. The seventh Baron Vaux was able to buy back the hall. On his death in 1935 the title fell into abeyance between his three daughters, the Hon. Grace Mary Eleanor Gilby, the Hon. Gladys Flora Charleton and the Hon. Dorothy Alice Mostyn.

The abeyance was terminated in 1938 in favour of the eldest daughter, Grace, the eighth Baroness and so far the only woman to hold the barony. She was the wife of William Gordon Gilbey, the owner of a wine and spirits group. Grace was succeeded by her eldest son, Father Gabriel Gilbey, the ninth Baron. He was a monk at Ampleforth Abbey. Lord Vaux of Harrowden took his seat in the House of Lords in 1962 and thereby became the first Benedictine monk to do so since 1559. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the tenth Baron. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the twelfth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2014 and was elected to the House of Lords in 2017.

The family seat is Rusko Estate, near Gatehouse of Fleet, Kirkcudbrightshire.

<doc id="449864" wikidata="Q53451" url="?curid=449864" title="John I Albert">
<text>John I Albert (; 27 December 1459 – 17 June 1501) was King of Poland from 1492 to his death and Duke of Głogów from 1491 to 1498. He was the fourth Polish sovereign from the Jagiellonian dynasty and the son of Casimir IV and Elizabeth of Austria.

Related to the House of Habsburg, John Albert was groomed to become emperor in the Holy Roman Empire, a plan that ultimately failed. He was well-educated and tutored by scholars such as Johannes Longinus and Callimachus, whom he had subsequently befriended. Heavily influenced by the Italian Renaissance, John sought to strengthen royal authority at the expense of the Catholic Church and the clergy. In 1487, he led a force against the Ottoman Empire and defeated the Tatars of the Crimean Khanate during the early phase of the Polish–Ottoman War. In the aftermath of the Bohemian–Hungarian War, John attempted to usurp Hungary from his elder brother Vladislaus, but was instead granted the Duchy of Głogów to calm his ambition.

John ascended to the Polish throne in 1492, and his younger brother Alexander was elected Grand Duke of Lithuania by an independent Lithuanian assembly, thus temporarily breaking the personal union between the two nations. He was proclaimed the king by an oral ballot orchestrated by his brother Cardinal Frederick Jagiellon. To secure his succession against the Piast princes from the Duchy of Masovia, he dispatched an army to the electoral proceedings, which alienated the higher nobles and magnates. He later invaded Masovia to deprive Konrad III of his ancestral holdings and curtail internal opposition to his rule. In 1497, John Albert launched a personal crusade into Moldavia to uphold Polish suzerainty, establish control over Black Sea ports and dethrone Stephen III in favour of John Albert&#x27;s brother Sigismund. The campaign&#x27;s failure greatly hindered Polish expansion into Southern Europe, preventing any significant further expansion.

John Albert remains a largely forgotten and overlooked figure in the history of Poland, his relatively short reign ended in a major military setback, and he was criticised during his lifetime for embracing absolutism as well as attempting to centralise the government. He is credited for creating a bicameral parliament, comprising the Senate and the Sejm, which granted lower-class gentry the right of expression in the matters of state. Conversely, he limited the movement of peasants by confining them to nobles&#x27; estates for life.

==Early life, 1459–1492==
===Birth and family background===
John was born on 27 December 1459 at Wawel Castle in Kraków, which served as the seat of Polish monarchs. He was one of thirteen children and the third son born to Casimir IV Jagiellon and Elizabeth Habsburg. His mother was the second child of Albert II, Duke of Austria and King of the Romans, and the granddaughter of Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor. It was the ambition of John&#x27;s parents to install one of their sons as Emperor in the Holy Roman Empire. Thus, he received the second name Albert at christening to honour his maternal grandfather and in the hope of securing his candidacy to the Imperial throne.

Paternally, John was the grandson of Jogaila, the pagan ruler of Lithuania who, upon the marriage to Jadwiga of Poland, adopted Catholicism, converted his native people to Christianity and was crowned King of Poland as Władysław II Jagiełło in 1386. Subsequently, his descendants held a strong claim to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Lithuanian lords were at first apprehensive about forming a union with Poland. The Lithuanian nobility and minorities feared that merging the two countries would threaten their sovereignty. The Poles were also dissatisfied as the Jagiellonians possessed no blood relations with their predecessors, the Piasts, who &quot;de facto&quot; ruled since the creation of statehood in AD 966. In the wake of Władysław II&#x27;s death, his eldest son Władysław III succeeded him in Poland, and his younger son Casimir in Lithuania. Władysław III&#x27; fall at the Battle of Varna in 1444 enabled Casimir&#x27;s lineage and sons to become the potential successors to both titles. John&#x27;s father was reluctant to accept the Polish crown and only did so when his opponents, Bolesław IV of Warsaw and Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg, strengthened their efforts. Raised abroad, he was initially branded as illegitimate by the Poles and was influenced by the Lithuanian gentry, whom he supported in their calls for a separate state. 

John&#x27;s right to the throne came entirely by coincidence, and it was his eldest brother, Vladislaus, who was destined to inherit Poland and Lithuania by primogeniture. This changed when George of Poděbrady pledged to make Vladislaus his heir in neighbouring Bohemia on the condition that Casimir IV negotiated a peace treaty with Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. Although the mediation between the two failed, the Bohemian Diet elected Vladislaus the King of Bohemia following George&#x27;s death in 1471. Casimir IV&#x27;s second son and his namesake, Casimir, then became the new heir apparent in Poland, however, he fell ill with tuberculosis and died in 1484. Six years later, Vladislaus was proclaimed King of Hungary, which was met with hostility from a faction of Hungarian nobles advocating for John Albert. Motivated by the Hungarians, John briefly invaded Hungary to usurp the title but was defeated by his brother at Košice in 1491 and again at Prešov in 1492. In spite of the conflict, the bond between the two siblings remained unhindered, and Vladislaus made John the Duke of Głogów for life to satisfy his ambition.

===Education===
Casimir IV was determined to educate all his sons equally and prepare them to assume the role of a monarch. In September 1467, chronicler and historian Johannes Longinus (Polish: &quot;Jan Długosz&quot;) was entrusted by Casimir with tutoring the royal children, including young John. Longinus, a deeply spiritual man, made sure that the princes were raised with great care and in accordance with Church laws. During their childhood, John and his brother Alexander were instructed to regularly visit the tombs of past sovereigns in an attempt to strengthen their allegiance to Poland. Latin and German, law, history, rhetoric, and classical literature were part of the rigid curriculum. According to the 16th-century political writer Stanisław Orzechowski, John was subjected to corporal punishment which was encouraged by his father. 

The Italian humanist and diplomat Filippo Buonaccorsi, known as Callimachus or Kallimach, exercised immense authority and influence over John in his early years and during his reign. He was initially appointed royal advisor and mentor at the behest of Queen Elizabeth. Buonaccorsi was described as more lenient and moderate than Longinus; he amended the syllabus with chess, sports and ancient studies concerning the works of Cicero and Virgil. Radical for the time, many of his ideas and theories were later endorsed by John, such as limiting the power of the clergy and centralising the government. Buonaccorsi further argued for the strengthening of the king&#x27;s authority, and asserting an absolute monarchy, at the expense of the nobility and inconspicuously advocated for the split with Rome. His appeal extended beyond politics and diplomacy; he befriended John and remained his most trusted courtier until he died in 1496.

==Reign, 1492–1501==
===Accession, 1492===
In accordance with the Union of Horodło (1413), Lithuania was to elect the Grand Duke by its own independent assembly of nobles in Vilnius. In turn, the Polish Crown Diet was obliged to nominate the King of Poland. These titles could be shared by one individual whose election was confirmed by both assemblies. On his deathbed, Casimir IV requested that John succeed him in the Crown and Alexander Jagiellon in the Grand Duchy. Lithuanian were satisfied with the proposition; a cluster of Polish nobility wished to continue the personal union between the two countries and initially opted for Alexander.

An electoral tribunal convened on 15 August 1492 in the city of Piotrków. The assembled nobles were to decide which candidate should ascend the throne. John&#x27;s successful 1487 engagement during the Polish–Ottoman War (1485–1503) against the Crimean Khanate and its Tatar units in the far east was a considerable determinant. Others pointed out his failed intervention in Hungary against his brother. Personal characteristics made the nobles agitated; although intelligent, John Albert was often described as and intolerably arrogant. In consequence, the Tęczyński and Leszczyński magnates voiced their support for John&#x27;s younger brother Sigismund, distinguished by his intellect and presumed chastity. 

Quarrels between highly-elevated members of state marked the tribunal; it was their course of action that determined the outcome. A considerable threat to the assembly were Janusz II of Płock and his brother Konrad, escorted a company of 1,000 hardline soldiers sent from the Duchy of Masovia. Janusz&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed by a strictly covert contingent of conservatives, whose intention was to restore the ancient House of Piast on the Polish throne. Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Primate of Poland, was part of that faction but was unable to attend due to poor health. Thereby, the Queen Dowager Elizabeth nominated her acquiescent son, Frederick Jagiellon, to lead the proceedings in his stead. 

An army of 1,600 men was dispatched to counter Janusz and Konrad if their troops resorted to violence. Meanwhile, John preoccupied himself with negotiations and aimed to procure the Prussian vote by recognising Lucas Watzenrode as the new Prince-Bishop of Warmia. In the end, it was Frederick&#x27;s personal intervention that secured the crown for John, who was unanimously proclaimed king by an oral ballot amongst the shrieks of nobles on 27 August 1492. A courier carried the news to the burghers of Kraków, which brought great joy to the townsfolk and prompted a bonfire celebration. The entourage then hurried to the capital, where he was crowned at Wawel Cathedral just less than a month later, on 23 September, by his ailing adversary Oleśnicki.

John Albert&#x27;s first months as king were unsettling and marred by insecurities. The Masovian Dukes still posed a considerable threat and placed his reign in jeopardy, with Masovia being independent of Poland at the time. In December 1492, John turned to Vladislaus and formed a much needed military alliance with Hungary against common foes. The brothers pledged mutual assistance and vowed to quell any opposition that undermined their rule.

===Creation of parliament, 1493===
Constitutionalism and parliamentary tendencies in Poland date back to the Late Middle Ages, when Louis I issued the 1374 Privilege of Koszyce, granting the nobility concessions (tax reductions) and prerogatives in return for favours or military support. Earlier attempts at unifying lower-class gentry with the high magnates into a single political entity were largely unsuccessful. Nobles of lower social status objected to the judiciary practices, superintended by their upper-class counterparts, which caused much discontent throughout the nobility. A major breakthrough came in 1454, when John&#x27;s father, Casimir, approved the Statutes of Nieszawa; which obligated the monarch to seek advice from the gentry and sejmiks (regional land councils) before taking action. According to Aleksander Gieysztor, the statutes acted as a counterweight to the oligarchy cultivated by the magnates and paved the way for an early parliamentary system.

Before establishing a long-lasting legislative body of government, the Polish king would summon a so-called &quot;curia regis&quot; which had no real authority over the sovereign. Its permanent members comprised the &quot;consiliarii&quot; — trusted courtiers and loyal personally selected by the reigning monarch. Under John Albert, the &quot;curia regis&quot; slowly transformed itself into the Senate of Poland. There were changes in conventional practices, for instance, Casimir IV first debated with his close council and then travelled to individual provincial sejmiks. John, on the other hand, called the sejmiks&#x27; representatives from across the country to gather and create a single unified assembly.

In January 1493, the first parliament composed of two chambers convened in Piotrków, which would host successive tribunals and parliament sittings long into the 16th century. The Sejm summoned on 18 January, the precise inauguration date is difficult to determine as the king stayed in Kraków until 13 January, and subsequently left for the town of Nowy Korczyn where the Lesser Polish nobility gathered on the 15th of the same month. He then returned to the capital before departing for Miechów and finally arriving in Piotrków no later than 28 January. It is, widely regarded that John&#x27;s entourage and the Lesser Polish lords arrived late to the parliament. Historian outlined that the weather conditions were not to blame, as the January of 1493 appeared relatively warm and dry. The delay may have been attributed to the extensive distance covered (approximately 40–50 kilometres a day), as well as to the festivities and welcoming ceremonies in each town his royal cortège passed. On 2 March, the king issued a universal act on taxation and closed the assembly on 3 March.

===Expelling Jews from Kraków, 1494–1495===

In June 1494, a fire broke out in Kraków during the visit of a Turkish envoy. Panic arose when the and nearby settlements became engulfed in flames. Commoners began to speculate and blamed the Jews for the inferno. Jewish-owned enterprises and dwellings were then pillaged, soon followed by riots against the city&#x27;s Jewish community. In the same year, the Jewish inhabitants, jointly with the city council representatives and burghers, lodged their complaints before John Albert in a private audience. John initially held the Jews in contempt and incarcerated leaders of the Jewish community; but was persuaded by Callimachus to release them shortly after. According to Byron Sherwin, instrumental in coercing the king was a Jewish woman by the name of Rachel, who was the lady-in-waiting to Queen Mother Elizabeth. In 1495, John issued an edict whereby he expelled Jews from Kraków and forcibly relocated them in the adjacent township of Kazimierz, which became one of Poland&#x27;s primary centres of Judaism. Chroniclers from the period make no mention of an expulsion; Marcin Kromer suggested that the relocation was in part voluntary and for the benefit of the Jews who faced persecution from Christians.

===Intervention in Masovia, 1495–1496===
John desired to assert royal power over Poland&#x27;s fiefdoms, most notably the Duchy of Masovia, whose Piast rulers held closer ties to the Gediminids and were allied with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Jagiellonians perceived the duchy as a quasi-state and a &quot;blot&quot; on their absolute sovereignty over East-Central Europe. John was a staunch supporter of imposing Polonisation into Poland&#x27;s spheres of influence, including Masovia and Monastic Prussia. 

When Duke Janusz II died heirless in February 1495, his brother Konrad hurried to secure his disputed succession by sending out troops to fortify Masovian castles. He failed in deterring Polish ambitions; John soon assembled a small force that marched into Masovia and occupied the ecclesiastical city of Płock, the region&#x27;s primary bishopric. Cardinal Frederick then prevented local canons from obtaining office and installed Jan Lubrański as bishop. Fearing an escalation, Konrad ordered his men to stand down; paving the way for the Jagiellons to uphold their claim to Masovia. A year later, Konrad paid homage to John at Piotrków; where, on accusations of insubordination, he was deprived of most holdings and hereditary possessions.

===Invasion of Moldavia, 1497–1499===
John desired to pose as the champion of Christendom against the Ottoman Turks, whilst regaining lost ports near the Black Sea (Cetatea Albă and Chilia) and strengthening suzerainty over Moldavia. His primary objective was to forcibly install his younger brother, Sigismund, on the Moldavian throne. Circumstances seemed, moreover, to favour the Poles. In his brother Vladislaus, he found a counterpoise to the machinations of Emperor Maximilian I, who in 1492 had concluded an alliance against him with Ivan III of Russia. As suzerain of Moldavia, John Albert was favourably situated for attacking the Turks. At the conference of Lőcse (1494), the details of the expedition were arranged between the kings of Poland and Hungary and Elector John Cicero of Brandenburg. However, John&#x27;s plan to dethrone Stephen III in favour of Sigismund was met with staunch resistance from the Hungarians.

In May 1496, John raised civil taxes to finance the forthcoming campaign. The true motive behind his personal crusade was concealed, and all religious dimensions were excluded. In turn, national defence and preventing an Ottoman incursion were chosen as the most suitable cause. This false narrative was conveyed to the people through tax proclamations. In August 1497, tax levies equivalent to 25 per cent of ecclesiastical incomes were demanded from the clergy by Cardinal Frederick Jagiellon to support his brother. By the summer of 1497, John assembled a strong army numbering some 80,000 men, supported by heavy artillery. Stephen III attempted to prevent John and the Poles from crossing into Moldavia. Endorsed by Ivan III, he persuaded John&#x27;s brother Alexander not to partake in the campaign. As reported by the &quot;Bychowiec Chronicle&quot;, the Lithuanian nobles condemned Poland&#x27;s actions and refused to set foot on Moldavian territory. 

The Polish army marched across the river Dniester and invaded Moldavia in August 1497. The Ottoman Sultan then sent reinforcements of about 600 men mostly comprising Janissaries who joined Stephen&#x27;s forces stationed at Roman (now in Romania). His final attempts to halt the Polish advance proved futile. The Moldavian chancellor, sent on a peacekeeping mission to the Polish camp, tried to convince the Poles to withdraw from the country; but John refused and had him confined. The unsuccessful attack on Suceava lasting from 24 September to 19 October curtailed John&#x27;s ambitions. The Polish army had its supply lines disrupted by the Moldavian forces and suffered from disease which forced John into bed. The siege of Suceava was lifted after Vladislaus sent a Hungarian army counting some 12,000 men to help Stephen. A truce was signed. At the Battle of the Cosmin Forest in Bukovina, the Moldavians routed the retreating Poles, whose heavy cavalry was unable to charge in thick woodland. The attack led to significant casualties, disorder and a loss of prestige for the Polish army. John eventually agreed to a humiliating peace treaty in 1499 and recognised Stephen as his equal and not as a feudal dependent.

The defeat in Moldavia incited raids into Polish territory, largely conducted by Tatars and other irregulars. In July 1498, Turkish marauders of Malkoçoğlu Bali Bey crossed into Podolia and reached as far west as Lwów, pillaging the city&#x27;s environs. Fearing a retaliatory attack by the Moldavians or the Ottoman Empire, John ordered the construction of new defensive fortifications; including what became one of Poland&#x27;s most recognisable monuments, the Kraków Barbican.

===Dispute with Teutonic Knights, 1499–1501===

The ceding of Prussia to Poland as a royal dependency in the aftermath of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466) caused great animosity between the Teutonic State and the Polish Crown, even when the two were allies. Tensions escalated further when John tried to secure his brother Frederick as Watzenrode&#x27;s successor in the Holy See. 

After the death of Johann von Tiefen, the Teutonic Order proclaimed Frederick of Saxony as the new Grand Master. Unlike his predecessor, Friedrich disregarded the Second Peace of Thorn of 1466 and refused to render homage to the Polish Crown. In 1499, he rejected John&#x27;s request to partake in a Sejm sitting at Piotrków, claiming that his absence stemmed from troubled domestic affairs. He then referred the matter to the Imperial Diet. Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, permitted Friedrich to aid Poland when called, but insisted that he refrains from searing oath of allegiance to the Polish king, instead maintaining &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;neighbourly&quot; relations.

According to Jędrzej Moraczewski, John demanded on five occasions that the Teutonic Knights pledge reverence and submission. When Maximilian denounced the Peace of Thorn, asserting that neither the Empire nor the Holy See approved it, John mobilised a force with heavy artillery and set out to Toruń in 1501 where the accords were initially signed. Friedrich dismissed the ultimatum to appear before John but sent representatives on his behalf to negotiate. Fearing a major regional conflict, George, Duke of Saxony, and John&#x27;s brother-in-law by marriage to Barbara Jagiellon, entrusted the Catholic Bishop of Meissen with mediating between the Poles and the Teutonic Knights. However, the negotiations stalled when John died unexpectedly.

==Death and burial==

The catastrophic Moldavian Campaign was a major blunder that psychologically scarred John for life and likely affected his health. He died suddenly on 17 June 1501 in Toruń, where he agreed to negotiate with the Teutonic Knights. The most likely cause of death was syphilis, though the monarch suffered from other ailments and battle wounds. The king&#x27;s body was embalmed for the journey, and on 29 June, the funeral cortège left Toruń for the royal capital of Kraków. His heart was embedded inside the Toruń Cathedral, but its exact location remains unknown.

John was laid to rest on 28 July 1501 at Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, in one of the dedicated chapels adjacent to the cathedral&#x27;s nave. The Late Gothic red-marble headstone with the king&#x27;s effigy and ledger was sculpted by Stanisław Stwosz, the son of Veit Stoss. From 1502 to 1505, Francesco Fiorentino created an Early Renaissance niche and archway, based on Leonardo Bruni&#x27;s tomb at the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence. The tomb&#x27;s resemblance to a triumphal arch was said to be an allusion to the imperial pretensions of John and the Jagiellonian dynasty in general. It is widely regarded as the first Renaissance composition in Poland and a breakthrough in Polish architecture.

==Personal life and assessment==
Unlike Alexander, John was not easily swayed and held firm views on the matters of state. 19th-century historians called him a &quot;valiant soldier, but no commander&quot;. Józef Ignacy Kraszewski emphasized the king&#x27;s interest in militarism and absolutism, which stemmed from his education supervised by radical Callimachus. To win support for the Moldavian Campaign, John was compelled to appease the nobility. In 1496, the townspeople were forbidden to own land, and the freedom of movement for peasants was abolished. The nobles would profit from the non-migrating peasants tied to the land and serfdom-based manorial estates called folwarks. This greatly hindered the development of Polish towns and cities in comparison with their Western European counterparts, and resulted in low urbanisation rates across the country.

John never married and remained a lifelong bachelor. It is uncertain whether he fathered any illegitimate children; it is evident that the king was a libertine who led a promiscuous life. Even during his lifetime, John was known to be a notorious womaniser and a dissolute. Maciej Miechowita writes that he &quot;indulged in [sexual] pleasures and desires like a warrior&quot;, and Marcin Kromer noted his &quot;insistence on carnal and affectionless love&quot;. Kromer did point out his ambition, occasional wit, and intelligence. He was known to be shrewd and gifted in languages, which assisted him in diplomacy. Privately, he enjoyed banqueting, hunting, and frequent drinking, which encouraged chroniclers to brand him as a drunkard. Accounts of John strolling intoxicated in the alleyways of Kraków; and engaging in public brawls cannot be substantially justified due to the lack of evidence.

During their encounter, Miechowita described John as &quot;tall, brown-eyed, with reddish skin on the face […] he was quick in movement and girded with a smallsword&quot;.

John&#x27;s unconventionally large court was the biggest of any Polish monarch: it numbered around 1,600 knights and courtiers.

<text>Prince Pyotr Romanovich Bagration (, ; 24 September 1818 – 17 January 1876), the son of general Prince Roman Bagration, was a Russian-Georgian statesman, general and scientist who invented the first dry galvanic cell.

== Biography ==
A descendant of the Georgian royal Bagrationi dynasty, with Georgia already annexed by the Russian Empire at the death of King George XII Bagration of Georgia in 1801, successor of King Erekle II Bagration, (Georgian: ერეკლე II) (7 November 1720 or 7 October 1721 – 11 January 1798) reigning as the king of Kakheti from 1744 to 1762, and of Kartli and Kakheti from 1762 until 1798.

Both his father, Roman (Revaz) Bagrationi (1778 — Tiflis, 1834), and uncle, Pyotr Bagration (Kizlar, Dagestan, 1765 — Battle of Borodino, 1812), were famous Russian Army generals.

In 1840 Bagration graduated from the Military Academy in St.Petersburg, Russia. The following year he started his lifelong research at the Scientific Laboratory of Physics of the St.Petersburg Academy of Sciences (now Russian Academy of Sciences), under Prussian-Russian Academician Moritz von Jacobi, Moritz Hermann von Jacobi, Boris Semyonovich von Jacobi (Russian: Борис Семёнович (Морис-Герман) Якоби) (21 September 1801 – 10 March 1874).

He was awarded the Prize of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences in 1850, and received the rank of Lieutenant-General in 1865.

In 1862 Bagration was made the Governor of Tver Governorate, and from 1870 until his death he was the Governor-General of the Baltic governorates (Courland, Livonia and Estonia). He was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir, 2nd degree (in 1868), the Order of the White Eagle (in 1869) and the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky (in 1872).

Bagration died in Saint Petersburg on 17 January 1876.

== Scientific work ==

Bagration created the first dry galvanic cell in 1843 and published a monograph about it in 1845. In other works he examined the reactions occurring in the galvanic cell and in galvanoplastics. In 1843 he performed gold electroplating in the presence of Moritz von Jacobi, the original inventor of electroplating and galvanoplastics.

In 1845 Bagration was sent by the Petersburg Academy of Sciences to Germany, France and England. He studied the solubility of metallic gold, silver and copper in aqueous solutions of cyanide compounds and was the first to discover the Elsner´s Equation, the stoichiometry of gold cyanidation.

In 1847 Bagration discovered a sorosilicate rich in rare earths which was named &quot;Bagrationite&quot; in his honour, but it had already been described as allanite (or orthite).

== Family ==

Prince Bagration was married to Anna Alekseyevna Martynova (1824–1885) and had twin daughters: 
*Yevgenia (1846–1903), fraulein of the Imperial Court
*Yelizaveta (1846–1868)
