<text>The national emblem of Belarus features a ribbon in the colors of the national flag, a silhouette of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is sometimes referred to as the coat of arms of Belarus, although in heraldic terms this is inaccurate as the emblem does not respect the rules of conventional heraldry. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the Communist hammer and sickle with a silhouette of Belarus. The Belarusian name is &quot;Dziaržaŭny hierb Respubliki Biełaruś&quot; (Дзяржаўны герб Рэспублікі Беларусь), and the name in Russian is &quot;Gosudarstvennyĭ gerb Respubliki Belarusʹ&quot; (Государственный герб Республики Беларусь).

Between 1991 and 1995, Belarus used a coat of arms, known as the Pahonia, as its national emblem. The Pahonia was originally a symbol of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, of which Belarus had historically been a part.

==Description==
===Design===
In the center of the emblem sits an orange outline of Belarus, superimposed over the rays of golden sun. The sun is partially covered by a globe, with the landmass (part of Eurasia) in red and waters in blue. Lining the left and right sides of the emblem are stalks of wheat, superimposed with flowers. Clovers adorn the left wheat stalks; flax flowers adorn the right. Wrapped around the wheat stalks is a red and green ribbon bearing the colours of the flag of Belarus; the ribbon meets at the base of the emblem, where the name &quot;Republic of Belarus&quot; (&quot;Рэспубліка Беларусь&quot;) is inscribed in gold in Belarusian. At the top of the emblem, there is a five-pointed red star.

===Symbolism===
The elements that comprise the state emblem are not tied to any &quot;official&quot; symbolism. The design of the emblem of the Byelorussian SSR was used as the basis for the current Belarusian emblem; the primary difference between the two is that the Byelorussian SSR emblem contains more references to Communism, such as the Communist symbol of hammer and sickle and pure red ribbon with Communist mottoes, which the modern emblem does not, replaced with the outline and the flag of Belarus, respectively; however, it still retains the communist red star, the red ribbon (albeit without the mottoes), the globe and the wheat bundles, which are also typical of Soviet emblems and still is very Soviet in nature.

===Legislation===

The current law regulating the design and use of the Belarusian emblem was passed on July 5, 2004. Article 9 of Chapter 3 of Law No. 301-3 begins by describing the official drawing of the Belarusian arms and regulates its proper design. Officially, the arms can be drawn in full colour, monochrome or using two colors. Article 10 states that the national emblem must be displayed at specified locations continually, such as the residences of the Belarusian leader, the chamber of the National Assembly and at governmental offices of national and regional levels.

The emblem can also be used on documents issued by the government, including money, passports and official letterheads. In addition, the emblem is displayed on all ballot boxes, campaign mailings and promotional standards when the election is starting.
It also appears on their border posts between Belarus and Russia.

The law also restricts the use of the emblem in other contexts—e.g. cities, towns or oblasts may not adopt a coat of arms or emblem using the national emblem either completely or in part. Furthermore, organizations not listed in the Law on State Symbols may only use the emblem by permission. The emblem can be used by both foreigners and citizens of Belarus, as long as the symbol is displayed with respect, although citizens may not use the state emblem on letterheads or business cards if they are not agents of the government.

==History==
===Pahonia===
Despite the fact that the Belarusians share a distinct ethnic identity and language, they never previously had a political sovereignty prior to 1918. According to vexillologist Whitney Smith, the unique Belarusian national symbols were not created until the 20th century, as a consequence of the foreign rule of the Belarusian territories by Prussia, Poland, Lithuania, and Russia. According to the formerly popular historian Arnold J. Toynbee, the pagan Lithuanians performed sweeping conquests of the Orthodox Ruthenians and this medieval greatness of Lithuania was conveyed in its heraldic emblem – a galloping horseman. The 18th-century Russian historian Vasily Tatishchev, who was at the time able to consult the subsequently lost &quot;Polotsk Chronicle&quot;, maintained that &quot;from time immemorial the coat of arms of Belarus [White Rus′] depicted a knight on horseback with his sword raised.&quot;

At the same time, Belarusian nationalists viewed the Grand Duchy of Lithuania as a historical form of Belarusian statehood along with medieval principalities of Polotsk, Turov and others. In the Lithuanian state&#x27;s early years, Ruthenian culture dominated the region. The Lithuanians allowed their East Slavic vassals to remain Orthodox, maintain their privileges and authority in local areas. Extensively influenced by their outnumbering Ruthenian subjects, Lithuanians reorganized their army, government administration, and legal and financial systems on Ruthenian models. A predecessor of Belarusian language, Ruthenian (also called &quot;Old Belarusian&quot; by various sources), was used as an administrative language in the 14th to 16th centuries in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. According to James H. Bater, the ruling Lithuanian warrior caste intermarried extensively with the nobility ruling the East Slav vassal principalities and accepted Orthodoxy. According to Richard Antony French, under Lithuanian rule, Belarusians had considerable autonomy.

This led to the Pahonia, one of the symbols of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, being accepted by Belarusian nationalists as a symbol of Belarus since the early 20th century. It was the official coat of arms of the Belarusian Democratic Republic since 1918. It was banned in the USSR, but widely and consistently used by the Belarusian post-World War II diaspora. Pahonia was the first coat of arms of the Republic of Belarus in 1991–1995. Since 1995, it has become one of the symbols of the democratic opposition to the authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko, particularly during the 2020–2021 Belarusian protests.

====Origins====
Some Belarusian historians make a connection between the Pahonia and the cultural context, religious and mythological beliefs of Belarus&#x27; earliest inhabitants. Horse worship was widespread both among Slavs and Balts. Lithuanian mythologists believe that the bright rider on the white horse symbolizes the ghost of the ancestral warrior, reminiscent of core values and goals, giving strength and courage. In Belarusian folklore, Yarilo – the ancient pagan god of spring revival and soil fertility – was particularly present. He was described as a young and handsome man on a white horse. Lithuanian ethnologist and folklorist Jonas Trinkūnas suggested that the Lithuanian horseman depicts Perkūnas, who was considered as the god of the Lithuanian soldiers, thunder, lightning, storms, and rain in Lithuanian mythology. Very early on, Perkūnas was imagined as a horseman and archeological findings testify that Lithuanians had amulets with horsemen already in the 10th–11th centuries, moreover, Lithuanians were previously buried with their horses who were sacrificed during pagan rituals, and prior to that it is likely that these horses carried the deceased to the burial sites.

St George was and still is traditionally portrayed riding a horse. He was one of Byzantine Christianity&#x27;s most popular saints, which spread in Belarus since the 10th century. Brothers Boris and Gleb, two saints revered by east Slavs, were frequently portrayed on a horse.

The Pahonia derives from the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was a regional symbol of Belarusian lands since the time when the territory of modern Belarus made up the largest part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where different variations of it were symbols of the Voivodeships of Minsk, Vitebsk, Polotsk, Brest Litovsk, Mstsislaw and Vilnius (of which the southern and eastern parts are now part of Belarus)

As Belarus was incorporated into the Russian Empire following the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, the Pahonia remained a key element of the coats of arms of some of Russian guberniyas established on the territory of Belarus: Vitebsk Governorate, Vilna Governorate. Besides that, under Russian rule, the Pahonia became an element (or the basis of) newly established coats of arms of numerous cities in Belarus and the neighbouring territories, including Polotsk, Vitebsk, Lyepyel, Mogilev and others.

==== 20th century ====
The Pahonia was the state emblem of the Belarusian Democratic Republic. It was also featured on a postcard printed by the government of the Belarusian Democratic Republic as the symbol of most of the “Belarusian voivodeships”. Since then, it is used by the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, the government-in-exile, as the “state symbol of Belarus”.
As West Belarus became part of interwar Poland, the Pahonia was used as the symbol of several provinces established on its territory, namely the Polesie Voivodeship, the Wilno Voivodeship, and the Nowogródek Voivodeship.

It was also used by West Belarusian political and cultural organisations, such as the Belarusian Schools Society and others.

During World War II, the pro-German collaborationist Belarusian Central Council used the Pahonia as its symbol.

Since after the war, the Pahonia has been used by organisations of the Belarusian diaspora such as the Association of Belarusians in Great Britain, the Belarusian Canadian Alliance and the newspaper Biełarus. A publishing and printing house based in Toronto and New York was named Pahonia; it produced also Belarusian titles.

The Order of the Pahonia was established by the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in exile in 1949 as the highest state award of Belarus. Since 2022, the Medal of the Order of the Pahonia is awarded by the BNR Rada.

Pahonia features on the original jacket of the first anthology of Belarusian poetry in English translation, Like Water, Like Fire (London, 1971).

In the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, part of the Soviet Union, the public demonstration of the Pahonia was banned, as was the case with non-Soviet national symbols in other republics of the Soviet Union.

====As a state symbol in the Republic of Belarus====
In the late 1980s, Belarusian pro-democracy organisations united under the Belarusian Popular Front have started using the symbols of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, including the Pahonia, as their symbols demanding democracy and independence of Belarus.

In 1991, after Belarus declared independence from the Soviet Union, the Pahonia became the coat of arms of the Republic of Belarus. The official version of the coat of arms was drafted by the artist Jauhien Kulik, an active member of the Belarusian Popular Front.

=====Referendum of 1995=====

The official status of Pahonia as the state coat of arms was cancelled in June 1995 by the authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko following a controversial referendum held earlier that year. The legality of the referendum and the validity of its results has been actively questioned by the democratic opposition to Lukashenko. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former White-red-white flag were compared to ones used by collaborationist forces during World War II in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made as the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian administration that collaborated with Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying &quot;we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride.&quot;

====Modern usage====
Since the mid-1990s, the Pahonia is widely used by the opposition to president Lukashenko, alongside the white-red-white flag. Persons have been arrested and subject to other political repressions for the public display of the Pahonia or the white-red-white flag.

Despite that, in 2007, the Pahonia has been included in the official list of objects of the immaterial historical and cultural heritage of Belarus.

Since the 1990s, the Pahonia is an element of the symbols of several Belarusian political and cultural organisations such as: the World Association of Belarusians, Union of Poles in Belarus, Francišak Skaryna Belarusian Language Society. Numerous organisations of the Belarusian diaspora continue using the Pahonia as their symbol or as an element thereof since the 1940s.

In 2018, the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic awarded the Belarusian Democratic Republic 100th Jubilee Medal to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the establishment of BNR, which features the 1918 styled Pahonia.

The popularity of Pahonia in Belarus rose again during the mass protests that followed a controversial presidential election of 2020. The Pahonia, in its version as the coat of arms of Belarus in 1991–1995, was actively used by pro-democracy protesters in Belarus and at solidarity events internationally alongside the white-red-white flag. The patriotic anthem of the same name, Pahonia, inspired by the coat of arms, was one of the symbols of the protests against the regime of Alexander Lukashenko. Pahonia is also used by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled leader of the protests.

According to Aleś Čajčyc, the Information Secretary of the Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic, the English&#x27;s Wikipedia&#x27;s Pahonia article was deleted by Lithuanian nationalists, who redirected it to the Coat of arms of Lithuania. He encouraged Belarusians to edit Wikipedia in order &quot;to defend Belarusian interests there&quot; and &quot;rebuff to the detractors of Belarus, of which there are many&quot;.
However the same year after secretary&#x27;s statement the official Twitter account of the exiled government tweeted that the coat of arms is &quot;a symbol of centuries of friendship between Belarusians and Lithuanians&quot;.

===Emblem of the Byelorussian SSR===

From 1920 until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Byelorussian SSR used an emblem instead of a coat of arms. The first emblem used by Soviet Belarus was adopted in 1919 and is similar to the contemporary insignia of the Russian and Ukrainian republics. The central part of the emblem is a stylized red shield, showing a golden sun rising from the base. Above the sun is a crossed golden hammer and sickle, symbolizing the unity between workers and peasants. Above the hammer and sickle, the letters &quot;Б.С.С.Р&quot; are shown in black, denoting the name of the republic. БССР (BSSR) is an abbreviation for the full name of the republic; &quot;Беларуская Савецкая Сацыялістычная Рэспубліка&quot;, the &quot;Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic&quot;. The shield is framed by ears of wheat meeting at its base and featuring a red ribbon inscribed in black with the state motto of the Soviet Union, &quot;Workers of the World, Unite!&quot; The text is written in the Belarusian language.

In 1937, this emblem was replaced by a new one, removing the shield and including more text. The right side of the emblem features oak leaves and the left features wheat ears with clovers placed on top. In the center of the emblem, the sun is rising behind a profile of Earth. A hammer, sickle and red star appears over the sun. Around the ears of wheat and leaves of oak is a red ribbon, featuring the phrase &quot;Workers of the World, Unite!&quot; written (from left to right) in Belarusian, Yiddish, Polish and Russian. The initials &quot;Б.С.С.Р&quot; are shown at its base denoting the name of the republic. Ten years before in 1927, the arms were the same except for the wording on the bottom ribbon. Instead of the letters reading БССР, the letters read &quot;С.С.Р.Б&quot;, which stood for the Soviet Socialist Republic of Byelorussia.

This emblem was in turn replaced by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and sickle, a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover on the left and flax on the right. A red ribbon is wrapped around the ears of wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters &quot;БССР&quot;. The ribbon features the phrase &quot;Workers of the World, Unite!&quot; The left side is inscribed in Belarusian, the right side is in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and sickle. The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem.

===Amendments to the national emblem===
In February 2020, the Belarusian parliament updated the emblem, with the globe centred on Belarus and showing more of Europe, rather than Russia and the colour of the outline map of the country changed from green to gold.

<doc id="457101" wikidata="Q6150388" url="?curid=457101" title="Samuel Nicholas">
<text>Samuel Nicholas (1744 – August 27, 1790) was an American Marine and military officer who was the first officer commissioned in the United States Continental Marines (predecessor to the United States Marine Corps) and by tradition is considered to be the first Commandant of the Marine Corps.

==Early life==
Nicholas was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1744, the youngest of three, to Anthony and Mary (Shute Cowman) Nicholas. His father was a blacksmith, un-Friended by the Philadelphia Meeting in 1749 for &quot;Evil Conduct in frequent drinking strong Liquor to Excess,&quot; and died when Samuel was 7. His mother, Mary Shute Nicholas, had died the year before. He was then taken in by his uncle, Attwood Shute, the Mayor of Philadelphia (1756–1758). In January 1752, his uncle enrolled him at the Academy and College of Philadelphia (now the University of Pennsylvania), the secondary-school counterpart of the College. Nicholas was a student there until the end of 1759. While at school, he became a Freemason who belonged to a Masonic Lodge that often met at Tun Tavern.

==Military service==

On November 28, 1775, Nicholas was commissioned a &quot;Captain of Marines&quot; by the Second Continental Congress, which was the first commission issued in the Continental Naval Service. Eighteen days afterwards, the Continental Congress resolved on November 10, 1775, That two battalions of Marines be raised consisting of one Colonel, two Lieutenant-Colonels, two Majors, and other officers, as usual in other regiments; that they consist of an equal number of Privates with other battalions; that particular care be taken that no persons be appointed to offices, or enlisted into said battalions, but such as are good seamen, or so acquainted with maritime affairs as to be able to serve by sea when required; that they be enlisted and commissioned to serve for and during the present war with Great Britain and the Colonies, unless dismissed by order of Congress; that they be distinguished by the names of the First and Second Battalion of Marines.

Captain Nicholas no sooner received official confirmation of his appointment to office than he established recruiting headquarters in Philadelphia. By January 1776, having recruited a sufficient number of Marines for the vessels that comprised the Continental Navy in the waters of Philadelphia, Capt. Nicholas assumed command of the Marine Detachment on board the &quot;Alfred&quot;. With Commodore Esek Hopkins in command, the &quot;Alfred&quot; set sail from Philadelphia on the morning of January 4, 1776. The following month witnessed the baptismal fire of the Marines.

==Battle of Nassau==

Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, had collected a store of arms and provisions at New Providence, in the Bahamas. Dunmore&#x27;s forces had done a great deal of injury along the Colonial coast, especially the shore of Virginia. Commodore Hopkins had been ordered to proceed to Abaco in the Bahamas, and from there to operate against the forces of Lord Dunmore. Commodore Hopkins decided to make an attack on New Providence, capture the enemy&#x27;s stores, and destroy his supplies. Capt Nicholas was placed in command of the landing party of 234 Marines. This attack, the first successful landing engaged in by Continental Marines, saw the capture of Nassau on March 3, 1776, without a fight.

On April 6, 1776, the Marines participated in the first naval battle between an American squadron and a British warship, when HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; came upon the squadron.

==Promoted to Major==
On June 25, 1776, Congress placed Nicholas &quot;at the head of the Marines with the rank of Major&quot;. Accordingly, Commodore Hopkins was advised to send Major Nicholas to Philadelphia, with dispatches for the Continental Congress. With notification of his promotion, he was ordered to report to the Marine Committee. The Committee detached him from the &quot;Alfred&quot; and ordered him to remain in the city, &quot;to discipline four companies of Marines and prepare them for service as Marine guards for the frigates on the stocks&quot;. Having recruited and thoroughly organised the companies, he requested arms and equipment for them.

==1776–1779==
In December 1776, Major Nicholas wrote to Congress: &quot;The enemy having overrun the Jerseys, and our army being greatly reduced, I was ordered to march with three of the companies to be under the command of His Excellency, the Commander-in-Chief.&quot; This was the first example of a battalion of Marines about to serve as an actual fighting unit under the direct command of Army authority. The Marines did not, however, engage in the attack on Trenton, on December 26, 1776, which followed General George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River. They were attached to General John Cadwalader&#x27;s division, which was ordered to cross the Delaware to Burlington, New Jersey, south of Trenton, in concert with Washington&#x27;s crossing to the north on the night of December 25, 1776, but was turned back due to ice floes on the river.

After the first Battle of Trenton, the battalion of Marines under the command of Maj. Nicholas participated in a battle with a detachment of Cornwallis&#x27;s main army at Princeton, New Jersey. During the ensuing months, Nicholas&#x27;s battalion served both as infantry and artillery, participating in several skirmishes.

Following the British evacuation of Philadelphia in June 1778, the Marine Barracks were reestablished and recruiting resumed. From then until the close of the war, Nicholas&#x27;s duties at Philadelphia were similar to those of later Commandants. Moreover, he was actively in charge of recruiting and sometimes acted as Muster Master of the Navy.

On November 20, 1779, Nicholas wrote Congress to request he be put in charge of the Marine Detachment aboard the 74-gun ship of the line &quot;America&quot;, then being constructed in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. However, Congress was firm in its intention that Nicholas remain in Philadelphia. Upon her completion, the &quot;America&quot; was presented to France as a gift.

After that, despite his requests to lead the Marine detachment on another ship, he mostly oversaw recruiting and training efforts. &quot;I consequently had the mortification to become … a useless officer,&quot; he wrote, &quot;at least in sense of danger.&quot;

==Return to civilian life==
After the Navy and Continental Marines were disbanded following the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783, Nicholas returned to civilian life and became an original member of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati.

He died on August 27, 1790, in Philadelphia during an epidemic of yellow fever and is buried in the Friends Graveyard at Arch Street Friends Meeting House.

==Legacy==
Three ships in the United States Navy have been named the USS &quot;Nicholas&quot; in his honor.

On November 10 of each year, the date celebrated as the Marine Corps&#x27; birthday, Nicholas&#x27;s grave in the Arch Street Friends Meeting graveyard in Philadelphia is marked with a wreath at dawn by a detachment of Marines.

A British 6-pounder cannon, captured by Major Nicholas&#x27; Marines at Nassau, is on display at Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.

<doc id="457105" wikidata="Q2450665" url="?curid=457105" title="Field trace">
<text>In mathematics, the field trace is a particular function defined with respect to a finite field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;, which is a &quot;K&quot;-linear map from &quot;L&quot; onto &quot;K&quot;.

==Definition==
Let &quot;K&quot; be a field and &quot;L&quot; a finite extension (and hence an algebraic extension) of &quot;K&quot;. &quot;L&quot; can be viewed as a vector space over &quot;K&quot;. Multiplication by &quot;α&quot;, an element of &quot;L&quot;,
:formula_1,
is a &quot;K&quot;-linear transformation of this vector space into itself. The &quot;trace&quot;, Tr&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), is defined as the trace (in the linear algebra sense) of this linear transformation.

For &quot;α&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, let &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), ..., &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) be the roots (counted with multiplicity) of the minimal polynomial of &quot;α&quot; over &quot;K&quot; (in some extension field of &quot;K&quot;). Then
:formula_2
If &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is separable then each root appears only once (however this does not mean the coefficient above is one; for example if &quot;α&quot; is the identity element 1 of &quot;K&quot; then the trace is [&quot;L&quot;:&quot;K&quot;&amp;hairsp;] times 1).

More particularly, if &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension and &quot;α&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, then the trace of &quot;α&quot; is the sum of all the Galois conjugates of &quot;α&quot;, i.e.,

:formula_3
where Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) denotes the Galois group of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;.

==Example==
Let formula_4 be a quadratic extension of formula_5. Then a basis of formula_6 is formula_7 If formula_8 then the matrix of formula_9 is:
:formula_10,
and so, formula_11. The minimal polynomial of &quot;α&quot; is .

==Properties of the trace==
Several properties of the trace function hold for any finite extension.

The trace is a &quot;K&quot;-linear map (a &quot;K&quot;-linear functional), that is
:formula_12.

If then formula_13

Additionally, trace behaves well in towers of fields: if &quot;M&quot; is a finite extension of &quot;L&quot;, then the trace from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;K&quot; is just the composition of the trace from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;L&quot; with the trace from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;K&quot;, i.e.
:formula_14.

==Finite fields==
Let &quot;L&quot; = GF(&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;) be a finite extension of a finite field &quot;K&quot; = GF(&quot;q&quot;). Since &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension, if &quot;α&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, then the trace of &quot;α&quot; is the sum of all the Galois conjugates of &quot;α&quot;, i.e.

:formula_15

In this setting we have the additional properties:
* formula_16.
* For any formula_17, there are exactly formula_18 elements formula_19 with formula_20. 

&quot;Theorem&quot;. For &quot;b&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot;, let &quot;F&quot;&quot;b&quot; be the map formula_21 Then if . Moreover, the &quot;K&quot;-linear transformations from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;K&quot; are exactly the maps of the form &quot;F&quot;&quot;b&quot; as &quot;b&quot; varies over the field &quot;L&quot;.

When &quot;K&quot; is the prime subfield of &quot;L&quot;, the trace is called the &quot;absolute trace&quot; and otherwise it is a &quot;relative trace&quot;.

===Application===
A quadratic equation, with &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0, and coefficients in the finite field formula_22 has either 0, 1 or 2 roots in GF(&quot;q&quot;) (and two roots, counted with multiplicity, in the quadratic extension GF(&quot;q&quot;2)). If the characteristic of GF(&quot;q&quot;) is odd, the discriminant indicates the number of roots in GF(&quot;q&quot;) and the classical quadratic formula gives the roots. However, when GF(&quot;q&quot;) has even characteristic (i.e., for some positive integer &quot;h&quot;), these formulas are no longer applicable.

Consider the quadratic equation with coefficients in the finite field GF(2&quot;h&quot;). If &quot;b&quot; = 0 then this equation has the unique solution formula_23 in GF(&quot;q&quot;). If then the substitution converts the quadratic equation to the form:
:formula_24
This equation has two solutions in GF(&quot;q&quot;) if and only if the absolute trace formula_25 In this case, if &quot;y&quot; = &quot;s&quot; is one of the solutions, then &quot;y&quot; = &quot;s&quot; + 1 is the other. Let &quot;k&quot; be any element of GF(&quot;q&quot;) with formula_26 Then a solution to the equation is given by:
:formula_27
When &quot;h&quot; = 2&quot;m&quot;&#x27; + 1, a solution is given by the simpler expression:
:formula_28

==Trace form==
When &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is separable, the trace provides a duality theory via the trace form: the map from to &quot;K&quot; sending to Tr(&quot;xy&quot;) is a nondegenerate, symmetric bilinear form called the trace form. If &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension, the trace form is invariant with respect to the Galois group.

The trace form is used in algebraic number theory in the theory of the different ideal.

The trace form for a finite degree field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; has non-negative signature for any field ordering of &quot;K&quot;. The converse, that every Witt equivalence class with non-negative signature contains a trace form, is true for algebraic number fields &quot;K&quot;.

If &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is an inseparable extension, then the trace form is identically 0.

<text>Juho Pietari &quot;Hannes&quot; Kolehmainen (; 9 December 1889 – 11 January 1966) was a Finnish four-time Olympic gold medalist and a world record holder in middle- and long-distance running. He was the first in a generation of great Finnish long-distance runners, often named the &quot;Flying Finns&quot;. Kolehmainen competed for a number of years in the United States, wearing the Winged Fist of the Irish American Athletic Club. He also enlisted in the 14th Regiment of the National Guard of New York, and became a U.S. citizen in 1921.

== Biography ==

Kolehmainen, a devoted vegetarian and bricklayer by trade, was from a sportive family from Kuopio – his brothers William and Tatu were also strong long-distance runners.

Kolehmainen won the 1911 British AAA Championships 4 miles title at the 1911 AAA Championships.

Hannes was one of the stars of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, winning three gold medals. His most memorable was the one in the 5000 m. In that event, he ran a heroic duel with Frenchman Jean Bouin. After leading the field together for most of the race, Bouin was only defeated by Kolehmainen in the final metres, in world record time. In addition, Kolehmainen won the 10,000 m and the now-discontinued cross country event. With the Finnish team, he also obtained a silver place in the cross country team event.

Kolehmainen&#x27;s sportive career was interrupted by the First World War, but he remained an athlete to be reckoned with, although his specialty had now shifted to the longer distances, especially the marathon. At the first post-war Olympics in Antwerp, he won the gold medal in this event. He would also enter the Olympic marathon in 1924, but did not complete that race.

By then, Kolehmainen had found a worthy successor in Paavo Nurmi. Together with Nurmi, as the final link in the torch relay, he lit the Olympic Flame at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He died in that same city, fourteen years later.

<doc id="457109" wikidata="Q203016" url="?curid=457109" title="Coat of arms of Belize">
<text>The coat of arms of Belize or national seal of Belize was adopted upon independence, and the current coat of arms is only slightly different from that used when Belize was a British colony (the Union Jack has been removed, and a Mestizo woodcutter has replaced one of the supporting Afro-Belizean woodcutters).

The circular border of the coat is formed by 25 leaves. Within the circle is a mahogany tree, in front of which is a shield tierced per pall inverted. Within the shield are the tools of a woodcutter in the upper sections and a ship in the lower one. These are symbolic of the importance of mahogany in the 18th- and 19th-century Belizean economy.

The flag of Belize features the coat of arms in its centre.

==Official description==
The College of Arms laid forth the blazon of the coat of arms as follows:

Crest – A mahogany tree proper

Compartment – A grassy field proper

Escutcheon – Party per pall inverted, 1st Argent a paddle and a squaring axe proper in saltire 2nd Or a saw and beating axe proper in saltire 3rd per fess bleu celeste and barry wavy or vert azure above the last a sailing ship proper

Supporters – Dexter a Mestizo (revised post-independence to Belizean Mestizo) woodsman proper garbed in trousers argent bearing in the dexter hand a beating axe, sinister an African (revised post-independence to Afro Belizean) woodsman proper garbed in trousers argent bearing in the sinister hand a paddle proper.

Other elements – The whole surrounded by a wreath of 25 leaves proper

<doc id="457115" wikidata="Q1643092" url="?curid=457115" title="Animal language">
<text>Animal languages are forms of communication between animals that show similarities to human language. Animals communicate through a variety of signs, such as sounds and movements. Signing among animals may be considered a form of language if the inventory of signs is large enough, the signs are relatively arbitrary, and the animals seem to produce them with a degree of volition (as opposed to relatively automatic conditioned behaviors or unconditioned instincts, usually including facial expressions).

Many researchers argue that animal communication lacks a key aspect of human language, the creation of new patterns of signs under varied circumstances. Humans, by contrast, routinely produce entirely new combinations of words. Some researchers, including the linguist Charles Hockett, argue that human language and animal communication differ so much that the underlying principles are unrelated. Accordingly, linguist Thomas A. Sebeok has proposed to not use the term &quot;language&quot; for animal sign systems. However, other linguists and biologists, including Marc Hauser, Noam Chomsky, and W. Tecumseh Fitch, assert that an evolutionary continuum exists between the communication methods of animal and human language.

==Aspects of human language==
Some experts argue the following properties separate human language from animal communication:

* &quot;Arbitrariness&quot;: There is usually no rational relationship between a sound or sign and its meaning. For example, there is nothing intrinsically house-like about the word &quot;house&quot;.
* &quot;Discreteness&quot;: Language is composed of small, separate, and repeatable parts (discrete units, e.g. morphemes) that are used in combination to create meaning.
* &quot;Displacement&quot;: Language can be used to communicate about things that are not in the immediate vicinity either spatially or temporally.
* &quot;Duality of patterning&quot;: The smallest meaningful units (words or morphemes) consist of sequences of units without meaning (sounds or phonemes). This is also referred to as double articulation.
* &quot;Productivity&quot;: Users can understand and create an indefinitely large number of utterances.
* &quot;Semanticity&quot;: Specific signals have specific meanings.

Research with apes, like that of Francine Patterson with Koko (gorilla) or Allen and Beatrix Gardner with Washoe (chimpanzee), suggested that apes are capable of using language that meets some of these requirements, including arbitrariness, discreteness, and productivity.

In the wild, chimpanzees have been seen &quot;talking&quot; to each other when warning about approaching danger. For example, if one chimpanzee sees a snake, said chimpanzee may make a low, rumbling noise, signaling for all the other chimps to climb into nearby trees. In this case, the chimpanzees&#x27; communication does not indicate displacement, as it is entirely contained to an observable event.

Arbitrariness has been noted in meerkat calls; bee dances demonstrate elements of spatial displacement; and cultural transmission has possibly occurred through language between the bonobos named Kanzi and Panbanisha.

Claims that animals have language skills akin to humans, however, are extremely controversial. In his book &quot;The Language Instinct&quot;, Steven Pinker illustrates that claims of chimpanzees acquiring language are exaggerated and rest on very limited or specious evidence.

The American linguist Charles Hockett theorized that there are sixteen features of human language that distinguish human communication from that of animals. He called these the design features of language. The features mentioned below have so far been found in all spoken human languages, and at least one is missing from any other animal communication system.
* &quot;Vocal-auditory channel&quot;: Sounds are emitted from the mouth and perceived by the auditory system. While this applies to many animal communication systems, there are many exceptions, such as those relying on visual communication. One example is cobras extending the ribs behind their heads to send the message of intimidation or of feeling threatened. In humans, sign languages provide many examples of fully formed languages that use a visual channel.
* &quot;Broadcast transmission and directional reception&quot;: This requires that the recipient can tell the direction that the signal comes from and thus the originator of the signal.
* &quot;Rapid fading&quot; (&quot;transitory nature&quot;): The signal lasts a short time. This is true of all systems involving sound. It does not take into account audio recording technology and is also not true for written language. It tends not to apply to animal signals involving chemicals and smells which often fade slowly. For example, a skunk&#x27;s smell, produced in its glands, lingers to deter a predator from attacking.
* &quot;Interchangeability&quot;: All utterances that are understood can be produced. This is different from some communication systems where, for example, males produce one set of behaviors and females another and they are unable to interchange these messages so that males use the female signal and vice versa. For example, Heliothine moths have differentiated communication: females are able to send a chemical to indicate preparedness to mate, while males cannot send the chemical.
* &quot;Total feedback&quot;: The sender of a message is aware of the message being sent.
* &quot;Specialization&quot;: The signal produced is intended for communication and is not due to another behavior. For example, dog panting is a natural reaction to being overheated, but is not produced to specifically relay a particular message.
* &quot;Semanticity&quot;: There is some fixed relationship between a signal and a meaning.

==Primates==
Humans are able to distinguish real words from fake words based on the phonological order of the word itself. In a 2013 study, baboons were shown to have this skill as well. The discovery has led researchers to believe that reading is not as advanced a skill as previously believed, but instead based on the ability to recognize and distinguish letters from one another. The experimental setup consisted of six young adult baboons, and results were measured by allowing the animals to use a touch screen and select whether or not the displayed word was a real word, or a non-word such as &quot;dran&quot; or &quot;telk&quot;. The study lasted for six weeks, with approximately 50,000 tests completed in that time. The researchers minimized common bigrams, or combinations of two letters, in non-words, and maximized them in real words. Further studies will attempt to teach baboons how to use an artificial alphabet.

In a 2016 study, a team of biologists from several universities concluded that macaques possess vocal tracts physically capable of speech, &quot;but lack a speech-ready brain to control it&quot;.

==Non-primates==
Among the most studied examples of non-primate languages are:

===Birds===
* Bird songs: Songbirds can be highly articulate. Grey parrots and macaws are well known for their ability to mimic human language. At least one specimen, Alex, appeared able to answer a number of simple questions about objects he was presented with, such as answering simple mathematical equations and identifying colors. Parrots, hummingbirds and songbirds display vocal learning patterns. Crows have been studied for their ability to understand recursion.

===Insects===
* Bee dancing: Used to communicate the direction and distance of food source in many species of bees. In 2023, James C. Nieh, Associate Dean and Professor of Biology with the University of California, San Diego, performed an experiment to determine if the dances of bees were innate skills or if they were developed through observation of older bees within their hive. The research group determined that the dance bees performed was to some degree innate, but the consistency and accuracy of the dance was a skill passed down by older bees. Although the experimental hive that contained only workers of the same age developed better accuracy when conveying angle and direction as they got older, their ability to communicate distance never reached the level of the control beehives.

===Mammals===
* African forest elephants: Cornell University&#x27;s Elephant Listening Project began in 1999 when Katy Payne began studying the calls of African forest elephants in Dzanga National Park in the Central African Republic. Andrea Turkalo has continued Payne&#x27;s work in Dzanga National Park by observing elephant communication. For nearly 20 years, Turkalo has used a spectrogram to record the noises that the elephants make. After extensive observation and research, she has been able to recognize elephants by their voices. Researchers hope to translate these voices into an elephant dictionary, but this will likely not occur for many years. Because elephant calls are often made at very low frequencies, the spectrogram is designed to detect lower frequencies than humans can perceive, allowing Turkalo to better understand the elephants&#x27; noise making. Cornell&#x27;s research on African forest elephants has challenged the idea that humans are considerably better at using language than animals, and that animals only have a small set of information they can convey to others. As Turkalo explained, &quot;many of their calls are in some ways similar to human speech.&quot; Elephants in captivity can be taught to remember tone, melody, and recognise more than 20 words.
* Mustached bats: Since these animals spend most of their lives in the dark, they rely heavily on their auditory system to communicate, including via echolocation and using calls to locate each other. Studies have shown that mustached bats use a wide variety of calls to communicate with one another. These calls include 33 different sounds, or &quot;syllables&quot;, that the bats either use alone or combine in various ways to form composite syllables.
* Prairie dogs: Con Slobodchikoff studied prairie dog communication and discovered that they use different alarm calls and escape behaviors for different species of predators. Their calls transmit semantic information, which was demonstrated when playbacks of alarm calls in the absence of predators led to escape behavior appropriate for the types of predators associated with the calls. The alarm calls also contain descriptive information about the general size, color, and speed of the predator.

====Aquatic mammals====
* Bottlenose dolphins: Dolphins can hear one another up to 6 miles apart underwater. Researchers observed a mother dolphin successfully communicating with her baby using a telephone. It appeared that both dolphins knew who they were speaking with and what they were speaking about. Not only do dolphins communicate via nonverbal cues, they also seem to chatter and respond to other dolphins&#x27; vocalizations.

* Whales: Two groups of whales, the humpback whale and a subspecies of blue whale found in the Indian Ocean, are known to produce repeated sounds at varying frequencies, known as whale songs. Male humpback whales perform these vocalizations only during the mating season, and so it is surmised the purpose of songs is to aid sexual selection. Humpbacks also make a sound called a feeding call, which is five to ten seconds in length at a nearly constant frequency. Humpbacks generally feed cooperatively by gathering in groups, swimming underneath shoals of fish and lunging up vertically through the fish and out of the water together. Prior to these lunges, whales make their feeding call. The exact purpose of the call is not known, but research suggests that fish react to it. When the sound was played back to them, a group of herring responded to the sound by moving away from the call, even though no whale was present.
* Sea lions: Since 1971, Ronald J. Schusterman and his research associates have studied sea lions&#x27; cognitive ability. They have discovered that sea lions are able to recognize relationships between stimuli based on similar functions or connections made with their peers, rather than only the stimuli&#x27;s common features. This is called &quot;equivalence classification&quot;. This ability to recognize equivalence may be a precursor to language. Research is currently being conducted at the Pinniped Cognition &amp; Sensory Systems Laboratory to determine how sea lions form these equivalence relations. Sea lions have also been proven to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language similar to one used with primates. The sea lions studied were able to learn and use a number of syntactic relations between the signs they were taught, such as how the signs should be arranged in relation to each other. However, the sea lions rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In the wild, it is thought that sea lions use reasoning skills associated with equivalence relations in order to make important decisions that can affect their survival, e.g. recognizing friends and relatives or avoiding enemies and predators. Sea lions use various postural positions and a range of barks, chirps, clicks, moans, growls, and squeaks to communicate. It has yet to be proven that sea lions use echolocation as a means of communication.
The effects of learning on auditory signaling in these animals is of interest to researchers. Several investigators have pointed out that some marine mammals appear to have the capacity to alter both the contextual and structural features of their vocalizations as a result of experience. Janik and Slater have stated that learning can modify vocalizations in one of two ways, by influencing the context in which a particular call is used, or by altering the acoustic structure of the call itself. Male California sea lions can learn to inhibit their barking in the presence of any male dominant to them, but vocalize normally when dominant males are absent. The different call types of gray seals can be selectively conditioned and controlled by different cues, and the use of food reinforcement can also modify vocal emissions. A captive male harbor seal named Hoover demonstrated a case of vocal mimicry, but similar observations have not been reported since. Still shows that under the right circumstances pinnipeds may use auditory experience in addition to environmental consequences such as food reinforcement and social feedback to modify their vocal emissions.

In a 1992 study, Robert Gisiner and Schusterman conducted experiments in which they attempted to teach syntax to a female California sea lion named Rocky. Rocky was taught signed words, then she was asked to perform various tasks dependent on word order after viewing a signed instruction. It was found that Rocky was able to determine relations between signs and words, and form basic syntax. A 1993 study by Schusterman and David Kastak found that the California sea lion was capable of understanding abstract concepts such as symmetry, sameness and transitivity. This suggests that equivalence relations can form without language.

The distinctive sounds of sea lions are produced both above and below water. To mark territory, sea lions &quot;bark&quot;, with non-alpha males making more noise than alphas. Although females also bark, they do so less frequently and most often in connection with birthing pups or caring for their young. Females produce a highly directional bawling vocalization, the pup attraction call, which helps mothers and pups locate one another. As noted in &quot;Animal Behavior&quot;, their amphibious lifestyle has made them need acoustic communication for social organization while on land.

Sea lions can hear frequencies between 100 Hz and 40,000 Hz, and vocalize from 100 to 10,000 Hz.

===Mollusks===
* Caribbean reef squid have been shown to communicate using a variety of color, shape, and texture changes. Squid are capable of rapid changes in skin color and pattern through nervous system control of chromatophores. In addition to camouflage and appearing larger in the face of a threat, squid use color, patterns, and flashing to communicate with one another in various courtship rituals. Caribbean reef squid can send one message via color patterns to a squid on their right, while they send another message to a squid on their left.

===Fish===
* Freshwater Elephant Fish have been observed to have their own language.
* Mexican Tetra have been observed communicating with a series of clicks, and have also been observed to have regional accents.

==Comparison of &quot;animal language&quot; and &quot;animal communication&quot;==

It is worth distinguishing &quot;animal language&quot; from &quot;animal communication&quot;, although there is some comparative interchange in certain cases (e.g. Cheney &amp; Seyfarth&#x27;s vervet monkey call studies). Animal language typically does not include bee dancing, bird song, whale song, dolphin signature whistles, prairie dog alarm calls, or the communicative systems found in most social mammals. The features of language as listed above are a dated formulation by Hockett in 1960. Through this formulation Hockett made one of the earliest attempts to break down features of human language for the purpose of applying Darwinian gradualism. Although an influence on early animal language efforts (see below), it is no longer considered the key architecture at the core of animal language research.
Animal language results are controversial for several reasons (for a related controversy, see also Clever Hans). 
Early chimpanzee work was executed using chimpanzee infants raised as if they were human; a test of the nature vs. nurture hypothesis. Chimpanzees have a laryngeal structure very different from that of humans, and it has been suggested that chimpanzees are not capable of voluntary control of their breathing, although better studies are needed to accurately confirm this. This combination is thought to make it very difficult for the chimpanzees to reproduce the vocal intonations required for human language. Researchers eventually moved towards a gestural (sign language) modality, as well as keyboard devices with buttons with symbols (known as &quot;lexigrams&quot;) that the animals could press to produce artificial language. Other chimpanzees learned by observing human subjects performing the task. This latter group of researchers studying chimpanzee communication through symbol recognition (keyboard) as well as through the use of sign language (gestural), are on the forefront of communicative breakthroughs in the study of animal language, and they are familiar with their subjects on a first name basis: Sarah, Lana, Kanzi, Koko, Sherman, Austin and Chantek.

Perhaps the best known critic of animal language is Herbert Terrace. Terrace&#x27;s 1979 criticism using his own research with the chimpanzee Nim Chimpsky was scathing and spelled the end of animal language research in that era, most of which emphasized the production of language by animals. In short, he accused researchers of over-interpreting their results, especially as it is rarely parsimonious to ascribe true intentional &quot;language production&quot; when other simpler explanations for the behaviors (gestural hand signs) could be put forth. Additionally, his animals failed to show generalization of the concept of reference between the modalities of comprehension and production; this generalization is one of many fundamental ones that are trivial for human language use. The simpler explanation according to Terrace was that the animals had learned a sophisticated series of context-based behavioral strategies to obtain either primary (food) or social reinforcement, behaviors that could be over-interpreted as language use.

In 1984 Louis Herman published an account of artificial language found in the bottlenose dolphin in the journal &quot;Cognition&quot;. A major difference between Herman&#x27;s work and previous research was his emphasis on a method of studying language comprehension only (rather than language comprehension and production by the animal(s)), which enabled rigorous controls and statistical tests, largely because he was limiting his research to evaluating the animals&#x27; physical behaviors (in response to sentences) with blinded observers, rather than attempting to interpret possible language utterances or productions. The dolphins&#x27; names here were Akeakamai and Phoenix. Irene Pepperberg used the vocal modality for language production and comprehension in a grey parrot named Alex in the verbal mode, and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh continues to study bonobos such as Kanzi and Panbanisha. R. Schusterman duplicated many of the dolphin results in his California sea lions (&quot;Rocky&quot;), and came from a more behaviorist tradition than Herman&#x27;s cognitive approach. Schusterman&#x27;s emphasis is on the importance on a learning structure known as equivalence classes.

However, overall, there has not been any meaningful dialog between the linguistics and animal language spheres, despite capturing the public&#x27;s imagination in the popular press. Furthermore, the growing field of language evolution is another source of future interchange between these disciplines. Most primate researchers tend to show a bias toward a shared pre-linguistic ability between humans and chimpanzees, dating back to a common ancestor, while dolphin and parrot researchers stress the general cognitive principles underlying these abilities. More recent related controversies regarding animal abilities include the closely linked areas of theory of mind, Imitation (e.g. Nehaniv &amp; Dautenhahn, 2002), Animal Culture (e.g. Rendell &amp; Whitehead, 2001), and Language Evolution (e.g. Christiansen &amp; Kirby, 2003).

There has been a recent emergence in animal language research which has contested the idea that animal communication is less sophisticated than human communication. Denise Herzing has done research on dolphins in the Bahamas whereby she created a two-way conversation via a submerged keyboard. The keyboard allows divers to communicate with wild dolphins. By using sounds and symbols on each key the dolphins could either press the key with their nose or mimic the whistling sound emitted in order to ask humans for a specific prop. This ongoing experiment has shown that in non-linguistic creatures sophisticated and rapid thinking does occur despite our previous conceptions of animal communication. Further research done with Kanzi using lexigrams has strengthened the idea that animal communication is much more complex than once thought.

==History==

===Beginning===
In early 1991, Vegard Skjefstad and Trond Michelsen, members of the demogroup Deadline, decided that they wanted to organize a big demoparty in Norway. In the late eighties/early nineties, it was common that demoparties (more commonly called &quot;copyparties&quot; at this time) were organized by large demogroups. Because of this, and the fact that Deadline wasn&#x27;t particularly well known, Mr. Skjefstad suggested that the group Crusaders should be involved. At this time, The Crusaders was one of Norway&#x27;s most popular Amiga groups. Partly because of their music disks, but also because of their diskmag, the Crusaders Eurochart. At first, Crusaders weren&#x27;t too keen on the idea of organizing a party, but when Mr. Skjefstad reminded them about the fact that they always complained about the other parties of the same sort, and that this was their chance to show everyone how it should be done, which caused the Crusaders to agree.

After briefly considering having the party during the fall of 1991, it was decided that Easter would be better. All schools are closed during Easter week and the period from Maundy Thursday to Easter Monday are official holidays in Norway. This meant that most of the target audience would have time off to attend TG, and all organizers and crew could work full-time with TG with a minimum usage of vacation days.

===1992–1995===
In 1992, 1100 people gathered in Skedsmohallen at Lillestrøm, way more than the expected count of about 800. The following years, TG continued to grow. In 1993 &quot;Skedsmohallen&quot; again was the venue with 1400 people visiting the party. This was more than the capacity of the venue, making it clear that a bigger venue was required. In 1994 the venue was &quot;Rykkinnhallen&quot; in Bærum, and the visitor count had risen to 1800 - again more than the venue could hold, which led to intervention by the local fire department who banned indoor sleeping. Consequently, the organizers had to hire a large construction tent and some heavy duty heating equipment (there was still snow on the ground).

No bigger venue could be found and this may have been one reason why Skjefstad and The Crusaders declined to arrange the party in 1995. A group from Stavanger led by Magnar Harestad proposed to host the party instead, and got approval and some backing from the TG crew. They hired Stavanger Ishall, &quot;Siddishallen&quot; and the party was renamed &quot;Gathering 95&quot;. However, this caused a sharp drop in attendance, barely 500 people attended, not even filling the hall to half capacity. This may have been due to moving the event away from the Eastern, more densely populated part of Norway - while the previous events had been held well within one hours drive from the capital of Oslo, Stavanger is over 470 km from Oslo, taking more than 7 hours to drive.

===1996-current===
Meanwhile, the venues built for the 1994 Winter Olympics were made available for hire, and prices were increasingly reasonable due to lack of interest. Amongst these were the Vikingskipet ice skating arena in Hamar, at the time Norway&#x27;s largest indoor arena - located hours&#x27; drive from central Oslo, and with good infrastructure (power, parking etc.). Skjefstad and The Crusaders decided to rent it and have another go, and The Gathering 1996, attracted around 2500 visitors.

The organizers then decided to create a separate organization, KANDU (Kreativ, Aktiv Norsk Dataungdom - &#x27;Creative, Active Norwegian Computer Youth&#x27;) for the specific purpose of running TG every year, and thus promote creativity and computer literacy.

Since then The Gathering continued to grow. By 1998 the maximum capacity of Vikingskipet, of about 5200 attendees, were reached. KANDU have not, however, decided to switch venues again although even larger venues such as the Telenor Arena at Fornebu outside of Oslo are now available. Instead, tickets for the event have sold out increasingly quickly. 
During The Gathering 2016, a concert of electronic music was performed on stage by Sabastian Teir alias &quot;Kebu&quot;.

The Gathering 2020 was cancelled after recommendations by local health authorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, it was to be arranged online under the hashtag TG:Online.

In-Person events resumed in 2021, 2022 and 2023. However, in January of 2024, The Gathering announced via X (formerly twitter) that the event had been canceled for 2024, with a promise to release more information in the future. 

The Gathering is set to return in 2025, following an announcement on X, looking for volunteers. 

==Daily life==

TG lasts for five days (from Holy Wednesday to Easter Sunday every year), and is both longer and bigger than most other computer parties. Most people tend to let their daily rhythm go and instead sleep as they see fit (many simply in front of their computer, but most people on the arena stands); for a lot of people most of the time is usually spent in front of a computer, but many like to use the opportunity to meet new or old friends in real life.

People have wildly different opinions about what constitutes a proper LAN party; the common trend at TG these years seem to be warez, games (the most popular being &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;), and IRC. However, many visitors find this too boring in the long run, and there are many unofficial mini-events happening all the time. Informal competitions to build the highest tower of soda cans are not uncommon, and people have been spotted having their own private mini-rave-parties put together by a few people and a PC with PA Systems.

==Happenings and the demoscene==
TG has always been a hub for young creative people to battle it out in many types of competitions; demo coding, music, graphics, animation, games, hardware-modification and Dance Dance Revolution to name a few; in addition, there are usually concerts and other things happening live on stage once or twice a day, as well as seminars etc.

In the first years, the focus on TG was pretty much on demos, but as TG is held at the same time as Breakpoint, a German scene-only party (and the earlier Mekka &amp; Symposium), many European demosceners have left TG in favour of BP, and TG, like the majority of other computer parties, has become more of a gamer event. The scene at TG still lives on, though, as TG has introduced features such as a demoscene-only area, &quot;creative cashback&quot; (those handing in entries to the creative competitions get a discount) and other demo-oriented events. In fact, you have to go back as far as 1996 to match the number of entries handed in to the creative competitions at TG04.

==Crew==
The organization Kreativ Aktiv Norsk Dataungdom (KANDU) is formally responsible for hosting TG. In addition, there are around 500 volunteers participating to make TG possible every year; these are collectively called &quot;the crew&quot;.

The TG crew is split into multiple sub-crews, such as a democrew (Event:Demo), a gamecrew (Event:Game), a first-aid crew (Security:Medic), a network crew (Tech:Net), a server crew (Tech:Server), as well as a logistics crew (Core:Logistikk) etc.. (The exact list varies somewhat from year to year.) Each of these has a chief who reports upwards, and is responsible for some aspect of the party.

All crew members are volunteers and unpaid; the only advantages a crew member has over a normal visitor are free entrance, access to a crew-only sleeping room and hot food served a few times a day. All members of the crew must arrive at the party place one day before the party itself starts, and stay one day after the party to aid in cleaning up afterwards. (Some people, such as chiefs, typically come even sooner.)

Everybody who wants can become crew (except for the Security and logistics crews, where there is a minimum age of 18), by applying at a special interface called &quot;wannabe&quot;. The chiefs usually pick their own crew, based on the applications coming in and previous experience. Crew members from earlier years must re-apply every year if they want to be crew again, but it is rare for a person having done a good job not to be selected the next year.

==Ticket sale controversy==
Up to and including TG01, TG tickets (as all other tickets to everything else happening in Vikingskipet) were sold by &quot;Billettservice&quot;, a company closely related to the postal service in Norway. Partly sold via the Internet, partly by phone (but always picked up at a local post office), the Billettservice system broke down hard every year as thousands of people tried to order tickets to the event simultaneously.

To try to make the ticket sales a bit more smooth, a group of people closely related to the administration of TG made a separate company called Partyticket (or Partyticket.net, PTN for short), selling unified ticket-related services (such as ordering, payment, seating, handling competitions etc.) to smaller and larger computer parties. Partyticket went online for the first time in 2002, and like Billettservice instantly went down under the massive load, partly due to a problem at the third-party service authorizing credit card transactions. However, the tickets were still sold out in a matter of hours.

2003 was not much better; a lot of problems had been fixed (and PTN had successfully managed the ticket sales for several other computer parties), but there were still problems left, and it was decided to postpone the ticket sales by one day to fix the problems that had been discovered. The sales went relatively smooth the next day.

In 2004, one hoped that one would finally see the end of the problems, especially as a new queuing system and new hardware was installed; however, the server again buckled under the enormous load, and the queueing system was found to be severely buggy, apparently shuffling people around in the queue at random. This frustrated a lot of visitors, many of which never got tickets at all. Many people blame the ticket-sales problems directly at PTN and has tried to pressure TG into choosing some other solution.

In 2005 the queuing system was changed. Instead of buying actual tickets, people were put in a virtual queue, thus loading the server a lot less during the peak hours. The next day, people were processed from the start of the queue (but no more than 200 at a time). This system ended up working a lot better than the queueing system from 2004, despite some misconceptions in the media.

Since 2006, however, there have been no major issues.

In 2007 the Norwegian Tax Authority demanded that taxes were to be paid for the tickets sold from 2001 to 2008, as it did not consider The Gathering to be a cultural event (all cultural events in Norway are exempt from paying taxes). Although the management of TG sent a complaint to the Tax Authority, it did not reconsider the demands. By August 8, the management of TG was required to pay 988,536 NOK in unpaid taxes, which could have caused the 2009 staging of The Gathering to be cancelled. If no money was paid by the August 8 deadline, the event could have been closed for good. However, on August 16, 2008, KANDU and The Gathering won the tax case and will temporarily be exempted from paying taxes for the tickets sold in 2006, 2007, 2008 and the future. Also, the law will be amended to secure this for all other computer parties in Norway. The stated reason for this decision is that &quot;The Gathering&#x27;s purpose is to gather youth from inland and abroad so these can get together to cultivate a computer culture&quot;, and the Storting has declared in a white paper that computer gaming is considered culture.

For The Gathering 2011 KANDU has signed an agreement for ticket sales with a company called Unicornis and their ticket system Geekevents. This agreement was for a three years period.

KANDU has signed a new contract with Geekevents AS, for a four-year period.

==Name==
Most years, TG has a name or &quot;tagline&quot;; the tagline doesn&#x27;t really mean much, but it still influences the logo (or the other way round) and some other material. A list of names includes:

<doc id="457120" wikidata="Q27870133" url="?curid=457120" title="Banach">
<text>Banach (pronounced in German, in Slavic Languages, and or in English) is a Jewish surname of Ashkenazi origin believed to stem from the translation of the phrase &quot;son of man&quot;, combining the Hebrew word &quot;ben&quot; (&quot;son of&quot;) and Arameic &quot;nasha&quot; (&quot;man&quot;). Worth mentioning is how the Sephardic surname &quot;Banache&quot; presents a variant with the &quot;-ache&quot; alternative ultima, common in other Jewish surnames such as &quot;Farache&quot;, &quot;Ayache&quot;, &quot;Nakache&quot;, &quot;Harache&quot; or &quot;Marrache&quot;.
Banach means &quot;bastard&quot; in Old Polish and in some Old Polish dialects &quot;someone clumsy&quot;. As of 2023 about 67529 Polish people carried this surname in forms: Banach, Banachewicz, Banachowicz, Banachowski, Banasz, Banaszyński, Banaszyk, Banaszuk, Banaszewski, Banaszek, Banaszak, Banasiak, Banaśkiewicz, ... . All those forms are connected with Banach, as in Polish &quot;-ch&quot; suffix often trangressed to &quot;-sz&quot; or &quot;-ś/-si&quot;. Additional &quot;-wicz&quot; is a patronymic suffix. Late (XVII century+) &quot;-ski/-cki/-dzki&quot; suffixes are connected with historical (middle ages) &quot;-ski&quot; reflecting Polish &quot;z&quot; (from) nobiliary particle (e.g. &quot;Jan z Tarnowa&quot; was equally known by the name &quot;Jan Tarnowski&quot;).
Notable people with this surname include:

*Stefan Banach (1892–1945), Polish mathematician
*Ed Banach (born 1960), American wrestler
*Lou Banach (born 1960), American wrestler
*Korneliusz Banach (born 25 January 1994), Polish volleyball player
* Łukasz Banach, birth name of Norman Leto (born 1980), Polish artist in the fields of painting, film, and new media
*Maurice Banach, German footballer
*Orest Banach, German-American soccer goalkeeper of Ukrainian descent
*William Banach (1903–1951), American politician, member of the Wisconsin State Assembly

<doc id="457124" wikidata="Q237840" url="?curid=457124" title="Coat of arms of Benin">
<text>The coat of arms or national seal of [[Benin]], originally introduced in 1964, was readopted in 1990 after being replaced in 1975. 

At the top of the emblem is the national crest that consists of two horns with corn in the ear and filled with sand. These are reputed to stand for prosperity. Below the crest is a shield that contains the actual coat of arms of Benin. 

The shield is broken into four quadrants. The top left quadrant contains a castle in the style of the Somba, representative of the history of Benin. In the top right quadrant, is the Star of Benin, the highest award of the nation. Below this is a ship, that stands for the arrival of Europeans in Benin. In the lower left quadrant is a palm tree.

The shield is supported by a pair of leopards, the national animal of Benin. Below the shield is the motto of Benin (Fraternity, Justice, Labour) in French.

==Official description==
The constitution of Benin puts for the blazon of the coat of arms as follows:

*Quarterly, 
#In the first quarter a Somba castle or;
#In the second argent the Star of Benin proper, which is a cross of eight points azure, anglé of rays argent and in fess point sable;
#In the third quarter argent a palm tree vert charged with a fruit gules;
#In the fourth quarter argent a ship sable sailing on a sea azure with a sewn upon the line of quartering a lozenge gules
*Supporters: two panthers or spotted;
*Above the shield: two cornucopias sable, ears of corn coming therefrom;
*Motto: Fraternité - Justice - Travail in letters sable on a scroll.
==People&#x27;s Republic of Benin (1975-1990)==

In 1975, the People&#x27;s Republic of Benin (as the country was then known - see &quot;history of Benin&quot; for more details) adopted a new coat of arms which reflected the country&#x27;s adherence to Marxism-Leninism. The symbolism of the flag was as follows:

*Green symbolized the nature of the country
*The red star symbolized socialism
*The corn cobs represented agriculture and farmers
*The cog-wheel represented industry and the working class

The coat of arms also featured the initials of the country: RPB ().

<text>Ahmad ibn Rusta Isfahani (), more commonly known as ibn Rusta (, also spelled &quot;ibn Roste&quot;), was a tenth-century Muslim Persian explorer and geographer born in Rosta, Isfahan in the Abbasid Caliphate. He wrote a geographical compendium known as the &quot;Kitāb al-A‘lāq al-Nafīsa&quot; ().

The information on Isfahan is especially extensive and valuable. Ibn Rusta states that, while for other lands he had to depend on second-hand reports, often acquired with great difficulty and with no means of checking their veracity, for Isfahan he could use his own experience and observations or statements from others known to be reliable. Thus we have a description of the twenty districts (&quot;rostaq&quot;s) of Isfahan containing details not found in other geographers&#x27; works. Concerning the town itself, we learn that it was perfectly circular in shape, with a circumference of half a parasang, walls defended by a hundred towers, and four gates.

== Recorded information ==
His information on the non-Islamic peoples of Europe and Inner Asia makes him a useful source for these obscure regions (he was even aware of the existence of the British Isles and of the Heptarchy of Anglo-Saxon England) and for the prehistory of the Turks and other steppe peoples.

He traveled to Novgorod with the Rus&#x27; and compiled books relating his own travels, as well as second-hand knowledge of the Khazars, Magyars, Slavs, Bulgars and other peoples.
* He wrote of a 10th-century city of the Rus&#x27;:
::&quot;As for the Rus, they live on an island … that takes three days to walk round and is covered with thick undergrowth and forests; … They harry the Slavs, using ships to reach them; they carry them off as slaves and … sell them. They have no fields but simply live on what they get from the Slav&#x27;s lands … When a son is born, the father will go up to the newborn baby, sword in hand; throwing it down, he says, &#x27;I shall not leave you with any property: You have only what you can provide with this weapon.&#x27;&quot;

:His impression of the Rus&#x27; seemed to be very favorable:
::&quot;They carry clean clothes and the men adorn themselves with bracelets and gold. They treat their slaves well and also they carry exquisite clothes, because they put great effort in trade. They have many towns. They have a most friendly attitude towards foreigners and strangers who seek refuge.&quot;

:This is in contrast to the account of Ibn Fadlan and other Arab authors, whose views on hygiene (based on Islamic hygienical jurisprudence) contrasted with that of the Rus&#x27;. However, the word &quot;clean&quot; initially appeared in the first Russian translation of Ibn Rustah by professor Daniel Chwolson (who also misspelled his name as Ibn Dasta(h)). Consecutive Russian editions of Chwolson&#x27;s translation include a footnote saying that the Arabic original clearly says the opposite, &quot;unclean&quot; or &quot;impure&quot;, and suggesting that Chwolson made such a correction intentionally, out of a remote concern that modern Russians might be offended by such characteristic.
* Of ancient Croatia he wrote in the chronicle &quot;Al-Djarmi&quot;:
::&quot;Their ruler is crowned … He dwells in the midst of the Slavs … He bears the title of &#x27;ruler of rulers&#x27; and is called &#x27;sacred king&#x27;. He is more powerful than the Zupan (viceroy), who is his deputy … His capital is called Drzvab where is held a fair of three days every month.&quot;
* About a certain king of the Caucasus Ibn Rustah wrote:
::&quot;He prayed on Fridays with the Muslims, on Saturdays with the Jews and on Sundays with the Christians. &#x27;Since each religion claims that it is the only true one and that the others are invalid&#x27;, the king explained, &#x27;I have decided to hedge my bets.&#x27;&quot;
* He also travelled extensively in Arabia and is one of the early Persian explorers to describe the city of Sana&#x27;a. In his &quot;Book of Precious Records&quot;, he writes:
::&quot;It is the city of Yemen — there not being found in the highland or the Tihama or the Hijaz a city greater, more populous or more prosperous, of more noble origin or more delicious food than it. … San&#x27;a is a populous city with fine dwellings, some above others, but most of them are decorated with plaster, burned bricks and dressed stones.&quot;

<doc id="457131" wikidata="Q1191142" url="?curid=457131" title="Hiroyuki Morioka">
<text>(born March 2, 1962, Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese science fiction novelist.

== Biography ==
In 1992, his first novel &quot;Yume no Ki ga Tsugeta nara&quot; (&quot;If Only the Dream Trees Could Touch&quot;) appeared in Hayakawa Publishing&#x27;s &quot;S-F Magazine&quot;. His short story &quot;Spice&quot; won the Hayakawa Award in 1993.

In 1996, he published his first long novel in three volumes, &quot;Seikai no Monshou&quot; (&quot;Seikai no Monshō&quot;/&quot;Crest of the Stars&quot;). In the next year 1997 Seikai no Monsho was awarded with
Seiun Award at the Japan SF Convention. He released its sequel &quot;Seikai no Senki&quot; (&quot;Banner of the Stars&quot;), where he said that Seikai no Monsho was actually an overture to Seikai no Senki. Morioka had already suggested in Seikai no Monshou 2 that the entire series should narrate the life of Princess Lamhirh (aka Lafiel), from her birth to her eventual ascension to the imperial throne. Six volumes of Seikai no Senki are now available, with Morioka naming the first three the &quot;Diahoc Trilogy&quot;, but the series itself has not yet finished. An English translation of &quot;Seikai no Monshō&quot;/&quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; has been published by Tokyopop, which came out from the fall of 2006 to May 2007.

Aside from the Seikai series, he published another &quot;Senki&quot; in 4 volumes, based on Japanese mythology, as well as a two-volume series, &quot;Seikai no Danshō&quot; (&quot;Fragments of the Stars&quot;), a collection of stories set in the same universe as the other two series.

His characteristics as a writer include a deep interest for linguistics (especially for conlangs), artificial intelligence, bitter humor, and well-designed world settings.

<doc id="457135" wikidata="Q1520240" url="?curid=457135" title="Studham">
<text>Studham is a village and civil parish in the county of Bedfordshire. It has a population of 1,182. The parish bounds to the south of the Buckinghamshire border, and to the east is the Hertfordshire border. The village lies in the wooded south facing dip slope of the Chiltern Hills. The hamlet of Holywell is located to the north of Studham, and forms part of the same civil parish.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, it was recorded as &quot;Estodham&quot;. Studham&#x27;s church celebrated its millennium in 1997.

The ancient parish of Studham straddled the Bedfordshire/Hertfordshire border. It also had a detached part known as Humbershoe which lay to the east of the rest of the parish, which contained the north-western part of the village of Markyate. Humbershoe became a separate civil parish in 1866, and was separated from the ecclesiastical parish of Studham in October 1877 when it was included in the new ecclesiastical parish of St John Markyate Street. In December 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, the parish of Studham was partitioned into two parts, one on each side of the county border. The Studham (Bedfordshire) parish was included in the Luton Rural District, whilst the Studham (Hertfordshire) parish was included in the Markyate Rural District. The two parishes were re-united as a single parish less than three years later, in September 1897, when the Studham (Hertfordshire) parish was transferred from Hertfordshire to Bedfordshire.

The village currently has two pubs; the older of which, The Bell, is considered to have been in existence before the English Civil War. In the early 20th century, work to make safe the old well in the pub garden revealed discarded or hidden civil war weapons.

In the early evening of 23 May 1948, an ex-RAF Handley Page Halifax, registered &quot;G-AIZO&quot;, and operated by Bond Air Services Ltd. carrying a cargo of apricots from Valencia, Spain, crashed at Studham.

==Education==

In previous eras Studham was included in a zone with priority admissions for a middle school, but this was no longer the case as of 2025.

<doc id="457143" wikidata="Q441167" url="?curid=457143" title="Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde">
<text>Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde (28 February 1735 – 1 January 1796) was a French mathematician, musician, and chemist who worked with Bézout and Lavoisier; his name is now principally associated with determinant theory in mathematics. He was born in Paris, and died there.

==Biography==
Vandermonde was a violinist, and became engaged with mathematics only around 1770. In &quot;Mémoire sur la résolution des équations&quot; (1771) he reported on symmetric functions and solution of cyclotomic polynomials; this paper anticipated later Galois theory (see also abstract algebra for the role of Vandermonde in the genesis of group theory). In &quot;Remarques sur des problèmes de situation&quot; (1771) he studied knight&#x27;s tours, and presaged the development of knot theory by explicitly noting the importance of topological features when discussing the properties of knots:

&quot;Whatever the twists and turns of a system of threads in space, one can always obtain an expression for the calculation of its dimensions, but this expression will be of little use in practice. The craftsman who fashions a braid, a net, or some knots will be concerned, not with questions of measurement, but with those of position: what he sees there is the manner in which the theads are interlaced&quot;

The same year he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences. &quot;Mémoire sur des irrationnelles de différents ordres avec une application au cercle&quot; (1772) was on combinatorics, and &quot;Mémoire sur l&#x27;élimination&quot; (1772) on the foundations of determinant theory. These papers were presented to the &quot;Académie des Sciences&quot;, and constitute all his published mathematical work. The Vandermonde determinant does not make an explicit appearance.

He was professor at the École Normale Supérieure, member of the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers and examiner at the École polytechnique.

== Honors ==
* A special class of matrices, the Vandermonde matrices are named after him, as is an elementary fact of combinatorics, Vandermonde&#x27;s identity.
* Vandermonde is the secret society of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers.

<text>John Walker (born 1805, Kilmarnock–1857) was a Scottish grocer, who originated what would become one of the world&#x27;s most famous whisky brand names, Johnnie Walker, despite the fact he was himself a teetotaler.

==Biography==
John Walker was born in 1805 near Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire. When his father Alexander died in 1820, he was left £417 in trust. In 1820, the trustees invested in an Italian warehouse, grocery, and wine and spirits shop on the High Street in Kilmarnock.

In 1833, John married Elizabeth Purves. He was a respected businessman, leader of the local trade association, and a Freemason. His store&#x27;s stock was almost entirely destroyed in an 1852 flood, but the business recovered within a couple of years. His own whisky brand, then known as &quot;Walker&#x27;s Kilmarnock Whisky&quot; was popular locally, although John Walker himself was a teetotaler.

John&#x27;s son Alexander Walker (named after John&#x27;s father) had apprenticed with a tea merchant in Glasgow, and there learned the art of blending tea. When he returned to take over the business from his ailing father, he used those skills to create &quot;Old Highland Whisky&quot; (eventually renamed &quot;Johnnie Walker Black Label&quot;), the blend that made Johnnie Walker whisky famous.

As one writer put it:

The Scottish cricketer John Walker, who was later a senior director at John Walker and Co. was a direct descendant of Walker.

<text>The hamate bone (from Latin , &quot;hooked&quot;), or unciform bone (from Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;hook&quot;), Latin os hamatum and occasionally abbreviated as just hamatum, is a bone in the human wrist readily distinguishable by its wedge shape and a hook-like process (&quot;hamulus&quot;) projecting from its palmar surface.

==Structure==
The hamate is an irregularly shaped carpal bone found within the hand. The hamate is found within the distal row of carpal bones, and abuts the metacarpals of the little finger and ring finger.

Adjacent to the hamate on the ulnar side, and slightly above it, is the pisiform bone. Adjacent on the radial side is the capitate, and proximal is the lunate bone.

===Surfaces===
The hamate bone has six surfaces:
* The superior, the apex of the wedge, is narrow, convex, smooth, and articulates with the lunate.
* The inferior articulates with the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones, by concave facets which are separated by a ridge.
* The dorsal is triangular and rough for ligamentous attachment.
* The palmar presents, at its lower and ulnar side, a curved, hook-like process, the hamulus, directed forward and laterally.
* The medial articulates with the triangular bone by an oblong facet, cut obliquely from above, downward and medialward.
* The lateral articulates with the capitate by its upper and posterior part, the remaining portion being rough, for the attachment of ligaments.

===Hook===

The &quot;hook of hamate&quot; () is found at the proximal, ulnar side of the hamate bone. The hook is a curved, hook-like process that projects 1–2 mm distally and radially. The ulnar nerve hooks around the hook of hamate as it crosses towards the medial side of hand.

The hook forms the ulnar border of the carpal tunnel, and the radial border for Guyon&#x27;s canal. Numerous structures attach to it, including ligaments from the pisiform, the transverse carpal ligament, and the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris.

Its medial surface to the flexor digiti minimi brevis and opponens digiti minimi; its lateral side is grooved for the passage of the flexor tendons into the palm of the hand.

===Development===
The ossification of the hamate starts between 1 and 12 months. The hamate does not fully ossify until about the 15th year of life.

===Other animals===
The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the &quot;fourth distal carpal&quot; of reptiles and amphibians.

==Function==

The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand.

==Clinical significance==
The hamate bone is the bone most commonly fractured when a golfer hits the ground hard with a golf club on the downswing or a hockey player hits the ice with a slap shot. The fracture is usually a hairline fracture, commonly missed on normal X-rays. Symptoms are pain aggravated by gripping, tenderness over the hamate and symptoms of irritation of the ulnar nerve. This is characterized by numbness and weakness of the fifth digit with partial involvement of the fourth digit as well, the &quot;ulnar 1½ fingers&quot;.

The hook of hamate is particularly prone to fracture-related complications such as non-union due to its tenuous blood supply.

It is also a common injury in baseball players. Several professional baseball players have had the bone removed during the course of their careers. This condition has been called &quot;Wilson&#x27;s Wrist&quot;.

The calcification of the hamate bone is seen on X-rays during puberty and is sometimes used in orthodontics to determine if an adolescent patient is suitable for orthognathic intervention (i.e. before or at their growth spurt).

==Etymology==
The etymology derives from the Latin &quot;hamatus&quot; &quot;hooked,&quot; from &quot;hamus&quot; which means &quot;hook&quot;.

<text>The A50 is a major trunk road in England between Warrington and Leicester; historically it was also a major route from London to Leicester.

==Route==
The current A50 runs south-east from Warrington via Junction 20 of the M6, Knutsford, Holmes Chapel, Kidsgrove and Stoke on Trent to Junction 24 of the M1 near Kegworth, via Derby&#x27;s southern bypass. From there it is concurrent with the M1 until Junction 22, where it runs into the City of Leicester.

The section from junctions 24a (in Lockington-Hemington) and 24 (in Kegworth) of the M1 is the former A6, and has not been widened. It has only three lanes westbound from junction 24a.

The Stoke-and-Derby section was originally intended to be part of an M64 motorway but this project was cancelled in the 1970s.

==Proposed development==
In November 2013 it was reported that funding would be being made available for improvements to the section around Uttoxeter, with work starting no later than 2015/16. A few days earlier the MP was lobbying for the improvements, stating that improvements were needed to the traffic islands for safety reasons and to improve traffic flow. There are plans for 700 new houses to the west of Uttoxeter and to the south of the A50.

==History==

===The old A50===
Prior to the opening of the M1, the A50 route was one of two main routes from London to the north-west via Leicester, until it was replaced during the 19th century by what has become the A6. A third route between London and Leicester was via the A5 to Old Stratford, A508 to Market Harborough and thence the A6. That route and the A50 route both passed through Northampton which was a significant calling point on many coaching routes until the arrival of the railways.

Until the M1 opened, the A50 used to terminate at Hockliffe in Bedfordshire at a junction with the A5.

When the M1 motorway opened alongside the old route south of Northampton it was down-classified as:
* B526 between Northampton and the Newport Pagnell bypass.
* A509 between the Newport Pagnell bypass and Junction 14 of the M1.
* A5130 between Junction 14 and Woburn
* A4012 between Woburn and Hockcliffe.

From that point until the 1990s the southern point of the A50 was at a junction with the A508 in Kingsthorpe, Northampton.

In the 1990s, with the opening of the A14 and to discourage traffic from using the road between Leicester and Northampton, the old route was re-designated as A5199 between Leicester and Northampton.

At the same time the A50 became the A511 north of Leicester, between Burton upon Trent and Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Leicester when the dual carriageway section bypassing Derby was completed.

===The current route===
Part of the route mirrored the plans for the original M64 motorway, with three lanes in some sections – notably between Kegworth and the A6 near Derby.

The new A50 route was opened in stages between March 1985 and 1999, with using various temporary designations:
*1985: £16m Blythe Bridge – Uttoxeter section from the north-west.
*1992: £2.6m Etwall bypass, opened as the A516.
*1995: £30.4m Hatton, Hilton and Foston bypass, opened by John Watts as the A564.
*1997 (June): £52m section 1 of Blythe Bridge – Queensway.
*1997 (September): the £109.5m Derby Southern Bypass (opened by Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman, Minister for Roads at the DETR), as the A564.
*1997 (September): The A6 Derby Spur.
*1997 (November): the £21m section 2 of Blythe Bridge – Queensway.
*1998: £20.6m Doveridge Bypass as the A564.
*1999: the delayed A50/M1 junction 24a improvements.

On completion, the Southern Derby Bypass was re-designated as the A50, being maintained privately by Connect A50 Ltd. Much of this new section of road is made of concrete.

==Incidents==
*In 2008, two mentally ill Swedish sisters, Ursula and Sabina Eriksson, caused mayhem on the nearby M6, and one of them jumped from an overpass on the A50.
*On 15 April 2018, a police pursuit on the road ended in a collision between two cars near Longton, Stoke-on-Trent. A man was killed and three others were injured, one critically. Staffordshire Police&#x27;s Collision Investigation Unit and the Independent Office for Police Conduct are both investigating.

<text>The lunate bone (semilunar bone) is a carpal bone in the human hand. It is distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated in the center of the proximal row carpal bones, which lie between the ulna and radius and the hand. The lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral scaphoid bone and medial triquetral bone.

==Structure==
The lunate is a crescent-shaped carpal bone found within the hand. The lunate is found within the proximal row of carpal bones. Proximally, it abuts the radius. Laterally, it articulates with the scaphoid bone, medially with the triquetral bone, and distally with the capitate bone. The lunate also articulates on its distal and medial surface with the hamate bone.

The lunate is stabilised by a medial ligament to the scaphoid bone and a lateral ligament to the triquetral bone. Ligaments between the radius and carpal bone also stabilise the position of the lunate, as does its position in the lunate fossa of the radius.

===Bone===
The proximal surface of the lunate bone is smooth and convex, articulating with the radius. The lateral surface is flat and narrow, with a crescentic facet for articulation with the scaphoid bone. The medial surface possesses a smooth and quadrilateral facet for articulation with the triquetral bone. The palmar surface is rough, as is the dorsal surface. The dorsal surface is broad and rounded. The distal surface of the bone is deep and concave.

===Blood supply===
The lunate receives its blood supply from dorsal and palmar branches.

===Variation===
The lunate has a variable shape. About one-third of lunate bones do not possess a medial facet, meaning they do not articulate with the hamate bone. Additionally, in about 20% of people, blood supply may arise from palmar vessels alone.

===Ossification===
The ossification of the lunate bone commences between 18 months and 4 years 3 months.

==Function==
The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. As a proximal carpal bone, the lunate is also involved in movement of the wrist.

== Clinical relevance ==

The lunate bone is the most frequently dislocated carpal bone. 
*Carpal coalition
*Kienbock&#x27;s disease
*Teisen classification

==Etymology==
The name of the lunate bone derives from the &quot;crescent-shaped&quot; (), from Latin &quot;luna&quot; (&quot;moon&quot;), from the bone&#x27;s resemblance to a crescent moon. In amphibians and reptiles, the bone is instead referred to as the intermedium, because of its position between the other two proximal carpals.

<text>Joseph Raymond Conniff (November 6, 1916 – October 12, 2002) was an American bandleader and arranger best known for his Ray Conniff Singers during the 1960s.

==Biography==
Conniff was born November 6, 1916, in Attleboro, Massachusetts, United States, and learned to play the trombone from his father. He studied music arranging from a course book.

===Early career===
After serving in the U.S. Army in World War II (where he worked under Walter Schumann), he joined the Artie Shaw big band and wrote many arrangements for him. After his stint with Shaw, he was hired in 1954 by Mitch Miller, head of A&amp;R at Columbia Records, as the label&#x27;s home arranger, working with several artists including Rosemary Clooney, Marty Robbins, Frankie Laine, Johnny Mathis, Guy Mitchell and Johnnie Ray. He wrote a top-10 arrangement for Don Cherry&#x27;s &quot;Band of Gold&quot; in 1955, a single that sold more than a million copies. Among the hit singles Conniff backed with his orchestra (and eventually with a male chorus) were &quot;Yes Tonight Josephine&quot; and &quot;Just Walkin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; by Johnnie Ray; &quot;Chances Are&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Not for Me to Say&quot; by Johnny Mathis; &quot;A White Sport Coat&quot; and &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; by Marty Robbins; &quot;Moonlight Gambler&quot; by Frankie Laine; &quot;Up Above My Head&quot;, a duet by Frankie Laine and Johnnie Ray; and &quot;Pet Me, Poppa&quot; by Rosemary Clooney. He also backed up the albums &quot;Tony&quot; by Tony Bennett, &quot;Blue Swing&quot; by Eileen Rodgers, &quot;Swingin&#x27; for Two&quot; by Don Cherry, and half the tracks of &quot;The Big Beat&quot; by Johnnie Ray. In these early years Conniff produced similar-sounding records for Columbia&#x27;s Epic label under the name of Jay Raye (which stood for &quot;Joseph Raymond&quot;), among them a backing album and singles with the American male vocal group Somethin&#x27; Smith and the Redheads.

Between 1957 and 1968, Conniff had 28 albums in the American Top 40, the most famous one being &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot; (1966). He topped the album list in Britain in 1969 with &quot;His Orchestra, His Chorus, His Singers, His Sound,&quot; an album which was originally published to promote his European tour (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) in 1969. He also was the first American popular artist to record in Russia—in 1974 he recorded &quot;Ray Conniff in Moscow&quot; with the help of a local choir. His later albums like &quot;Exclusivamente Latino,&quot; &quot;Amor Amor,&quot; and &quot;Latinisimo&quot; made him very popular in Latin-American countries, even more so after performing in the Viña del Mar International Song Festival. In Brazil and Chile in the 1980s and 1990s, he was treated like a young pop superstar despite being in his seventies and eighties. He played live with his orchestra and eight-person chorus in large football stadiums as well as in Viña del Mar.

Conniff commented, &quot;One time I was recording an album with Mitch Miller – we had a big band and a small choir. I decided to have the choir sing along with the big band using wordless lyrics. The women were doubled with the trumpets and the men were doubled with the trombones. In the booth Mitch was totally surprised and excited at how well it worked.&quot; Because of the success of his backing arrangements, and the new sound Conniff created, Miller allowed him to make his own record, and this became the successful &quot;’s Wonderful!&quot;, a collection of standards that were recorded with an orchestra and a wordless singing chorus (four men, four women). He released many more albums in the same vein, including &quot;’s Marvelous&quot; (1957, gold album), &quot;’s Awful Nice&quot; (1958), &quot;Concert in Rhythm&quot; (1958, gold album), &quot;Broadway in Rhythm&quot; (1958), &quot;Hollywood in Rhythm&quot; (1959), &quot;Concert in Rhythm&quot;, Vol. II (1960), &quot;Say It With Music&quot; (1960), &quot;Memories Are Made of This&quot; (1960, gold album), and &quot;’s Continental&quot; (1962). His second album was &quot;Dance the Bop!&quot; (1957). It was an experiment by one of the senior managers at Columbia to cash in on a new dance step, but from the outset, Conniff disliked it. When it sold poorly, he had it withdrawn.

===The Ray Conniff Singers===

In 1959, Conniff started The Ray Conniff Singers (12 women and 13 men) and released the album &quot;It&#x27;s the Talk of the Town.&quot; This group brought him his biggest hit: &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot; (1966). The lyrics of the album&#x27;s title track were sung to the music of &quot;Lara&#x27;s Theme&quot; from the film &quot;Doctor Zhivago,&quot; and it became a US top 10 single.

The album reached the US top 20 and went platinum, and Conniff won a Grammy. The single and album also reached high positions in the international charts (a.o. Australia, Germany, Great Britain, Japan), while the first of four Christmas albums by the Singers, &quot;Christmas with Conniff&quot; (1959) was also successful.

Nearly 50 years after its release, in 2004, Conniff was posthumously awarded a platinum album/CD. Other well-known releases by the Singers included &quot;Ray Conniff&#x27;s Hawaiian Album&quot; (1967), featuring the hit song &quot;Pearly Shells,&quot; and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; (1970), which included Conniff&#x27;s original composition &quot;Someone&quot;, and remakes of such hits as &quot;All I Have to Do is Dream&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Fall in Love Again&quot;, and &quot;Something&quot;.

Musically different highlights in Conniff&#x27;s career are two albums he produced in cooperation with Billy Butterfield, an old friend from earlier swing days. &quot;Conniff Meets Butterfield&quot; (1959) featured Butterfield&#x27;s solo trumpet and a small rhythm group, and &quot;Just Kiddin&#x27; Around&quot; (after a Conniff original composition from the 1940s), released in 1963, which featured additional trombone solos by Ray himself. Both albums are pure light jazz and did not feature any vocals.

===Later years===
Conniff recorded in New York from 1955 to 1961, and mainly in Los Angeles from 1962 through 2000. Later in the 1960s he produced an average of one vocal and two instrumental albums a year.

In 1979, Conniff was hired to re-arrange and record a new version of &quot;Those Were The Days&quot; and &quot;Remembering You&quot;, the opening and closing themes to &quot;All in the Family&quot; for Carroll O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s new spin-off, &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; on CBS with a small ensemble, trombone solo, and honky-tonk piano. Conniff sold about 70 million albums worldwide, and continued recording and performing until his death in 2002.

==Death==
Ray Conniff died October 12, 2002, in Escondido, California after falling and hitting his head on a sink, and is buried in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. His grave marker bears a musical score with the first four notes of &quot;Somewhere My Love&quot;. Conniff was survived by his wife Vera (April 7, 1944 - January 7, 2018, buried in the same plot as Ray), daughter Tamara Conniff, son Jimmy Conniff (died 2015), and three grandchildren.

==Legacy==
In 2004, a memorial two-CD compilation set, &quot;The Essential Ray Conniff,&quot; was released, featuring many rare and previously unreleased tracks. &quot;The Singles Collection, Vol. 1&quot; was released on the Collectables label in 2005, &quot;The Singles Collection, Vol. 2&quot; in 2007, and Vol. 3 was released in 2009. These collections feature rare singles and previously unissued tracks. His music is also featured prominently in the movie &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot;.

In 2022, &quot;Bah Bah Conniff Sprach (Zarathustra)&quot;, from Conniff&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;, was featured in a Salesforce TV commercial starring Matthew McConaughey.

==Ray Conniff Singers membership==
In 1959, Conniff started The Ray Conniff Singers (12 women and 13 men).

From 1962 through 2001, membership in the Ray Conniff Singers included:

==Hit records==
==Spinoffs==
A special version of the song &quot;Happiness Is&quot; was recorded for use in a TV commercial for Kent cigarettes, prior to the ban on TV advertising of tobacco products.

==Holiday 100 chart entries==
Since many radio stations in the US adopt a format change to Christmas music each December, many holiday hits have an annual spike in popularity during the last few weeks of the year and are retired once the season is over. In December 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; began a Holiday Songs chart with 50 positions that monitors the last five weeks of each year to &quot;rank the top holiday hits of all eras using the same methodology as the Hot 100, blending streaming, airplay, and sales data&quot;, and in 2013 the number of positions on the chart was doubled, resulting in the Holiday 100. Two recordings by Conniff and The Singers have made appearances on the Holiday 100 and are noted below according to the holiday season in which they charted there.

<text>Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness is a 1998 book by neurologist and Zen practitioner James H. Austin, in which the author attempts to establish links between the neurological workings of the human brain and meditation. The eventual goal would be to establish mechanisms by which meditation induces changes in the activity of the brain, which in turn induces a state of mental clarity. For example, Austin presents evidence from EEG scans that deep relaxed breathing reduces brain activity.

The publishers described their book as a &quot;Comprehensive text on the evidence from neuroscience that helps to clarify which brain mechanisms underlie the subjective states of Zen, and employs Zen to &#x27;illuminate&#x27; how the brain works in various states of consciousness&quot;. Austin starts with a discussion of Zen Buddhism, its goals, and practices. Having laid this groundwork, he then turns to explore the neurological basis of consciousness.

Austin wrote a follow-up, &quot;Zen-Brain Reflections&quot;.

<text>Bambers, also known as Poznań Bambergians, are Poles who are partly descended from Germans who moved from the area of Bamberg (Upper Franconia, Germany) to villages surrounding Poznań, Poland. They settled in villages which had been destroyed during the Great Northern War and the subsequent epidemic of plague, including: 
* 1719 in Luboń
* 1730 in Dębiec, Jeżyce, Winiary and Bonin
* 1746–1747 in Rataje and Wilda
* 1750–1753 in Jeżyce and Górczyn

== History and meaning ==

After the economically important villages surrounding Poznań were devastated by the war and the plague, the city authorities decided to attempt to replenish their population through immigration. King Augustus II of 1710 allowed this, as long as the newly arrived settlers were Catholic. About 700 Germans came in several waves. At least 450 to 500 men and women came to Poland according to surviving contracts, however, later documents suggest this number may have been as high as 900 people in four waves of immigration.

The integration of the group was voluntary, and some families were already Polonised by 1800. Many of the settlers learned Polish in order to attend Catholic masses, and their children learned Polish at school. Mixed marriages with Poles living in the area began to happen. By the end of the 19th century, during the Chancellor Bismarck&#x27;s policy of Germanisation in Poland, all residents in villages inhabited by the settlers chose Polish nationality during Prussian and German censuses. The Bambers as a group opposed the Germanisation policy.

The word &quot;bamber&quot; later expanded in meaning in Polish to denote well-off farmers in general, regardless of heritage. According to Culture.pl, this was due to the success of many Bambers due to good economic terms and hard work. Sometime after the early 20th century, it also came to be used to mean &quot;backwards, primitive person&quot;. According to Culture.pl, this is because the Bambers often remained farmers after the Poznań expanded and annexed the villages in the early 20th century. 

In the late 19th century, the meaning of the word &quot;Bamber&quot; (singular form) became wider - it started to denote all people living in those villages, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background. Many of them were soldiers of the Polish army fighting in the Great Poland Uprising. During the German occupation of Poland most of them, like most Poles, were persecuted for their Polish identity. After World War II, they were the subject of suspicion from the Polish communist government due to their German-sounding surnames and faced repression, including sometimes the confiscation of their land and property. The situation improved after the fall of communism in Poland in 1989.

== Culture ==
A well known aspect of Bamber culture is its extravagant female dresses.

<doc id="457180" wikidata="Q76959" url="?curid=457180" title="Ralf Dahrendorf">
<text>Ralf Gustav Dahrendorf, Baron Dahrendorf, (; 1 May 1929 – 17 June 2009) was a German-British sociologist, philosopher, political scientist and liberal politician. A class conflict theorist, Dahrendorf was a leading expert on explaining and analysing class divisions in modern society. Dahrendorf wrote multiple articles and books, his most notable being &quot;Class and Conflict in Industrial Society&quot; (1959) and &quot;Essays in the Theory of Society&quot; (1968).

During his political career, he was a Member of the German Parliament, Parliamentary Secretary of State at the Foreign Office of Germany, European Commissioner for Trade, European Commissioner for Research, Science and Education and Member of the British House of Lords, after he was created a life peer in 1993. He was subsequently known in the United Kingdom as Lord Dahrendorf.

He served as director of the London School of Economics and Warden of St Antony&#x27;s College, University of Oxford. He also served as a professor of sociology at a number of universities in Germany and the United Kingdom and was a research professor at the Berlin Social Science Research Center.
==Biography==
===Family===
Dahrendorf was born in Hamburg, Germany, in 1929, the son of Lina and Gustav Dahrendorf and brother of Frank Dahrendorf.

Dahrendorf was known for strongly supporting anti-Nazi activities. As a child, Ralf was a member of the Deutsches Jungvolk, the youngest branch of the Hitler Youth. When Ralf was only a teenager, he and his father, an SPD member of the German Parliament, were arrested and sent to concentration camps for their anti-Nazi activities during the Nazi regime. One of the activities consisted of Dahrendorf distributing leaflets that were encouraging people not to join the regime. After this, his family moved to Berlin. In 1944, during the last year of the Second World War, he was arrested again for engaging in anti-Nazi activities and sent to a concentration camp in Poland. He was released in 1945.

===Marriages and children===
Dahrendorf was married three times. He married his first wife, Vera, in 1954. She was a fellow student at the London School of Economics. Together they had three daughters: Nicola, Alexandra and Daphne Dahrendorf. Nicola Dahrendorf has worked for the United Nations and as the West Africa Regional Conflict Adviser to the UK Government.

From 1980 to 2004, he was married to historian and translator Ellen Dahrendorf (née Ellen Joan Krug), the daughter of Professor James Krug. When he was created a peer in 1993, his wife became known as Lady Dahrendorf. Ellen Dahrendorf, who is Jewish, has served on the board of the Jewish Institute for Policy Research, been chair of the British branch of the New Israel Fund, and is a signatory of the Independent Jewish Voices declaration, which is critical of Israeli policies towards the Palestinians.

Dahrendorf&#x27;s first two marriages ended in divorce. In 2004 he married Christiane Dahrendorf, also known as Lady Christiane Dahrendorf, a medical doctor from Cologne.

===Education and career===
Ralf Dahrendorf studied philosophy, classical philology, and sociology at Hamburg University between 1947 and 1952. He continued his academic research at the London School of Economics under Karl Popper as a Leverhulme Research Scholar in 1953–1954, gaining a PhD degree in sociology in 1956. At this early stage in Dahrendorf&#x27;s academic career, he took an interest in Marxist theory and wrote his PhD thesis on Karl Marx&#x27;s theory of justice. After completing his doctorate he returned to Germany, where he was a professor of sociology at Hamburg (1957–1960), Tübingen (1960–1964) and Konstanz (1966–1969) universities. He was one of the founders (1964) of the University of Konstanz.

From 1957 to 1959, Dahrendorf talked about &quot;this ability to organize as the principle between quasi-groups and interest groups&quot;. Quasi-groups are defined as &quot;those collectives that have latent identical role interests but do not experience a sense of &quot;belongingness&quot;. Interest groups, on the other hand, &quot;have a structure, a form of organization, a program or goal, and a personnel of members&quot;. The interest groups identity and sense of belonging are produced when people have the ability to communicate, recruit members, form leadership, and create a unifying ideology In 1960, he became a visiting professor of sociology at Columbia University in New York.

From 1967 to 1970, he was Chairman of the German Sociological Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie), resigning it when he took up his office at Brussels. Between 1976 and 1979 he led the educational sub-committee of the Benson Commission.

From 1968 to 1969, Dahrendorf was a member of the Parliament of Baden-Württemberg, and also in 1968, his links with Harvard University began. Dahrendorf decided to become a member of the Bundestag in 1969 during the time when Brandt formed his first SPD-FDP coalition government. After joining, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the foreign minister. Because he was placed third on the ladder of command in the foreign ministry, he did not enjoy the experience. From 1969 to 1970 he was a member of the German parliament for the Free Democratic Party (the German liberals). During this period he was also a Parliamentary Secretary of State in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1970 he became a Commissioner in the European Commission in Brussels. He was dedicated to the EU as a guarantor of human rights and liberty.

In 1974, the BBC invited him to present the annual Reith Lectures. In this series of six radio talks, entitled &quot;The New Liberty&quot;, he examined the definition of freedom.

From 1974 to 1984, Dahrendorf was director of the London School of Economics. Ehen he returned to Germany to become Professor of Social Science, at Konstanz University (1984–86).

In 1986, Ralf Dahrendorf became a Governor of the London School of Economics. From 1987 to 1997, he was Warden of St Antony&#x27;s College at the University of Oxford, succeeding the historian Sir Raymond Carr.

In 1982, Dahrendorf was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1988, he acquired British citizenship. and became known as Sir Ralf Dahrendorf (as only KBEs who are British subjects are entitled to use that title). On 15 July 1993, he was created a life peer with the title Baron Dahrendorf &quot;of Clare Market in the City of Westminster&quot;. Clare Market is near the London School of Economics, and is also used for car parking by LSE staff. Dahrendorf chose this name to honour the School in this way, and also as a sign of his liberal humour. He sat in the House of Lords as a cross-bencher.

Between 2000 and 2006, Dahrendorf served as Chairman of the Judging Panel of the FIRST Award for Responsible Capitalism. He received the FIRST Responsible Capitalism lifetime Achievement Award in 2009. Dahrendorf insisted that even the most basic civil rights, including equality and freedom of expression, be given constitutional legitimacy. On 11 July 2007, he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Social Studies.

In January 2005, he was appointed a research professor at the Social Science Research Center in Berlin (WZB).

Dahrendorf held dual citizenship in the UK and Germany. After retiring, he lived partly in Germany and partly in the United Kingdom, with one home in London and one in Bonndorf in south-western Germany. When asked which city he considered his home, he once said, &quot;I am a Londoner&quot;. He also once said that his life was marked by a conflict between the obligation he felt to the country of his birth, Germany, and the attraction he felt for Britain.

He favoured laws and policies that encouraged personal freedom, a sense of citizenship, and a broadening of social, economic and political opportunities. He argued that Germany&#x27;s problems stemmed from a belief in absolute answers and in the yearning for an all-powerful leader to put them into effect.

===Death===
Dahrendorf died in Cologne, Germany, aged 80, on 17 June 2009, after suffering from cancer.

He was survived by his third wife, three daughters, and one grandchild. His death was confirmed in a statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said, &quot;Europe has lost one of its most important thinkers and intellectuals&quot;.

==Concepts==
===&quot;Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society&quot;===
In 1959, Dahrendorf published in his most influential work on social inequality, &quot;Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society&quot;. Despite later revisions and affirmations of his work, the book still remains his first detailed and most influential account of the problem of social inequality in modern, or post-capitalist societies.

In analysing and evaluating the arguments of structural functionalism and Marxism, Dahrendorf believed that neither theory alone could account for all of society. Marxism did not account for evidence of obvious social integration and cohesion. Structural functionalism, on the other hand, did not focus enough on social conflict. He also asserted that Karl Marx defined class in a narrow and historically specific context. During Marx&#x27;s time, wealth was the determining factor in attaining power. The wealthy and therefore the powerful ruled, leaving no way for the poor to gain any power or increase their position in society.

Drawing on aspects of both Marxism and structural functionalists to form his own beliefs, Dahrendorf highlighted the changes that have occurred in modern society. Dahrendorf believed in two approaches to society, Utopian and Rationalist. Utopian is the balance of values and solidity and Rationalist is the dissension and disagreement. While he believes that both are social perspectives, the Utopian approach is most apparent in modern-day society, leaving Dahrendorf to create a balance between the two views. Dahrendorf discusses literary utopias to show that the structural-functionalists idea of the social system is utopians in itself because it possess all the necessary characteristics. Specifically, with democracy came voting for political parties, and increased social mobility. He believes that the struggle for authority creates conflict. Money, political power, and social status were all controlled by the same group – the capitalist – which gave the workers little incentive to accept the status quo.

Furthermore, he believes that traditional Marxism ignores consensus and integration in modern social structures. Dahrendorf&#x27;s theory defined class not in terms of wealth like Marx, but by levels of authority. Dahrendorf combines elements from both of these perspectives to develop his own theory about class conflict in post-capitalist society. Dahrendorf agrees with Marx that authority, in the 19th century, was based on income, and thus the rich bourgeoisie ruled the state. Yet things changed then, where workers formed trade unions and allowed them to negotiate with the capitalist.

===Class conflict theory===
Dahrendorf proposed a symbolic model of class conflict with authority as the generic form of domination, combined with a strong systematic view of society and the structuration of class relationships. This new theory is said to have taken place in reaction to structural functionalism and in many ways represents its antithesis. The conflict theory attempts to bring together structural functionalism and Marxism.

According to Dahrendorf, functionalism is beneficial when trying to understand consensus while conflict theory is used to understand conflict and coercion. In order to understand structural functionalism, we study three bodies of work: Davis and Moore, Parsons, and Merton. Dahrendorf states that capitalism has undergone major changes since Marx initially developed his theory on class conflict. The new system of capitalism, known as post-capitalism, is characterised by a diverse class structure and a fluid system of power relations. Thus, it involves a much more complex system of inequality than Marx originally outlined. Dahrendorf contends that post-capitalist society has institutionalised class conflict into state and economic spheres. For example, class conflict has been habituated through unions, collective bargaining, the court system, and legislative debate. In effect, the severe class strife typical of Marx&#x27;s time is no longer relevant.

Conflict theorists like Dahrendorf often took the exact opposite view of functionalists Whereas functionalists believe that society was oscillating very slightly, if not completely static, conflict theorists said that &quot;every society at every point is subject to process of change&quot;. Conflict theorists believe that there is &quot;dissension and conflict at every point in the social system&quot; and &quot;many societal elements as contributing to disintegration and change&quot;. They believe order comes from coercion from those at the top, and that power is an important factor in the social order.

In developing his conflict theory, Dahrendorf recognised consensus theory was also necessary to fully reflect society. Consensus theory focuses on the value integration into society, while conflict theory focuses on conflicts of interest and the force that holds society together despite these stresses. In the past, structural functionalism was the commanding theory in sociology, until the conflict theory came along as its major challenger. However, both structural functionalism and conflict theory have received major criticisms. In fact, Dahrendorf asserted that there has to be consensus to have conflict, as he said that the two were prerequisites for each other. The opposite is also true, he believed –– conflict can result in cohesion and consensus. However, Dahrendorf did not believe the two theories could be combined into one cohesive and comprehensive theory. Instead, Dahrendorf&#x27;s thesis was &quot;the differential distribution of authority invariably becomes the determining factor of systematic social conflicts&quot;. &quot;In the end, conflict theory should be seen as a little more than a transitional development in the history of sociological theory. Although the theory failed because it didn&#x27;t go far in the direction of Marxian theory, it was still early in the 1950s and 1960s for American sociology to accept a full-fledged Marxian approach. However, conflict theory was helping in setting the stage for the beginning of the acceptance by the late 1960s&quot;.

=== The Liberal Order ===
While Dahrendorf acknowledged that liberal market societies are prone to conflicts, he admonished that, at the same time, they were in the best position to handle the conflict. Instead of being suppressed, the tensions become factors that help societies move forward. It&#x27;s up to governments to turn the tension and conflict into solutions. The need is, then, for conflict management if this is to happen peacefully. Dahrendorf saw conflict in modern societies as stemming from more than just different individual interests and expectations. He saw conflict arising from outgrowing the unavoidable tensions that modern societies have to negotiate and balance between the competing values of justice, liberty, and economic well-being, and between economic efficiency, identity, and security. He sought to understand how societies could develop into just and prosperous nations. The essence of Dahrendorf&#x27;s ideas about the future of the liberal order is about identifying both latent and manifest tensions at the different levels in which they exist, the potential for conflict, and identifying the options available for solutions and resolving conflict.

===Authority===
Dahrendorf opposed those who studied authority on an individual level. He was very critical of those who focused on the psychological or behavioural characteristics of the individuals who occupy such positions. He went even further to say that those who adopted that approach were not sociologists. Dahrendorf believed that Marx&#x27;s theory could be updated to reflect modern society and Roman society. He rejects Marx&#x27;s two-class system as too simplistic and overly focused on property ownership. Due to the rise of the joint stock company, ownership does not necessarily reflect control of economic production in modern society. Instead of describing the fundamental differences of class in terms of property, Dahrendorf claims that we must &quot;replace the possession, or non-possession, of effective private property by the exercise of, or exclusion from, authority as the criterion of class formation&quot;. A crucial component to Dahrendorf&#x27;s conflict theory is the idea of authority. Although it initially appears to be an individual issue and psychological, Dahrendorf argues that authority is related to positions and not to individuals. In this way, subordination and authority are products of expectations specified by society, and if those roles are not adhered to, sanctions are imposed. Dahrendorf expands on this idea with the notion that roles of authority may conflict when in different positions that call for different things. According to Dahrendorf, these different defined areas of society where people&#x27;s roles may be different are called imperatively coordinated associations. The groups of society in different associations are drawn together by their common interests. Dahrendorf explains that latent interests are natural interests that arise unconsciously in conflict between superordinates and subordinates. He defines manifest interests as latent interests when they are realised. In conclusion, Dahrendorf believes that understanding authority to be the key to understanding social conflict.

Dahrendorf, like Merton, looked at latent and manifest interests and further classified them as unconscious and conscious interests. He found the connection between these two concepts to be problematic for the conflict theory. Dahrendorf believed that the basis of class conflict was the division of three groups of society: quasi groups, interest groups, and conflict groups. Thus, society can be split up into the &quot;command class&quot; and the &quot;obey class&quot;. The command class exercises authority, and the obey class has no authority and is also subservient to that of others. With a clear interplay between both class types class conflict theory sought to explain that interplay. Quasi groups are &quot;aggregates of incumbents of positions with identical role interests&quot;. Interest groups are derived from the quasi groups and they are organised with members, an organisation, and a program or goal. The main difference between quasi-groups and interest groups is that interest groups organise and have a sense of &quot;belonging&quot; or identity. Darhendorf acknowledged that other conditions like politics, adequate personnel, and recruitment would play a role along with the groups. He also believed that under ideal circumstances, conflict could be explained without reference to other variables. Unlike Marx, however, he did not believe that random recruitment into the quasi-group would start a conflict group. In contrast to Lewis Coser&#x27;s ideas that functions of conflict maintained the status quo, Dahrendorf believed that conflict also leads to change (in social structure) and development. His belief in a changing society separated Dahrendorf&#x27;s ideas from Marx, who supported the concept of a utopia.

===Marx and Dahrendorf&#x27;s perspectives on class formation===
Marx believed history to be defined as class struggle. He defined class as the difference between the dominating class and those who dominate. He believed that in modern society, there were three types of classes: capitalists, workers and petite bourgeoisie. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are the pillars in the formation of classes. The Capitalists and bourgeoisie are the ones that own the means of production and are able to purchase the labour of others. The proletariat does not own any means of production or have the ability to purchase labour but can only sell their own. Marx believed that the battle between the different classes formed the concept of class phenomenon.

Marx understood that there are two classes: the rulers who control the means of production and the ruled who work with the means of production. Every society needs both. The conflicts between them causes a destruction of the existing societal order so that it can be replaced by a new one.

On the other hand, Dahrendorf believed that the formation of classes was the organisation of common interests. That further means that people who are in positions of authority are supposed to control subordination, meaning that sanctions could be put into effect against people who fail to obey authority commands, resulting in fines and further punishments. Dahrendorf argues that society is composed of multiple units that are called imperatively coordinated associations. He saw social conflict as the difference between dominating and subject groups in imperatively-coordinated associations.

Marx believed that class formation was based on the ownership of private property. On the contrary, Dahrendorf argued that class formation was always based on authority. He defined authority as a facet of social organisations and as a common element of social structures. There is also another difference between Marx and Dahrendorf concerning the structure of societies. Dahrendorf believed that society had two aspects: consensus and conflict, static and change, order and dissension, cohesion and the role of power, integration and conflict, and lastly consensus and constraint. He saw them all as equally the double aspects of society. On that point, Dahrendorf asserted that society could not survive without both consensus and conflict. He felt that way because without conflict, there can be no consensus, and although consensus leads to conflict, conflict also leads to consensus.

==Criticism==
The most prevalent criticism of Dahrendorf&#x27;s conflict theory is that it only takes a macro-sociological perspective. The theory fails to address much of social life. In increasingly modern, multicultural societies, the contested concept and construct of identity received growing emphasis and was the focus of many debates. As a consequence of the debates over identity, and inevitably in a globalising, modern, multicultural world, the issues of citizenship came into play. Specifically, the discussions analysed the ways in which citizenship contributed to the formation and construction of identities. Dahrendorf&#x27;s adherence to a Marxian position seemingly prevented him from participating in these debates. Absent from Dahrendorf&#x27;s theory were any significant discussions of culture, and therefore, citizenship and identity.

==Relationship to other classical theorists and perspectives==
Unlike many of the other works published by social theorists in the 1950s, Dahrendorf&#x27;s work acknowledges the same class interests that worried Marx. Like Marx, Dahrendorf agreed that conflict is still a basic fact of social life. Dahrendorf believed that class conflict could have beneficial consequences for society, such as progressive change. Dahrendorf is recognised for being one of the best departures from the structural functionalist tradition of the 1950s. Dahrendorf criticised and wanted to challenge the &quot;false, utopian representation of societal harmony, stability, and consensus by the structural functionalist school.&quot; Nevertheless, Dahrendorf still shares key ideas with structural functionalists, such as a general faith in the efficacy of political and economic institutions. Like Weber, Dahrendorf criticises Marx&#x27;s view that the working class will ultimately become a homogeneous group of unskilled machine operators. Dahrendorf points out that in postcapitalist society there are elaborate distinctions regarding income, prestige, skill level, and life chances. Dahrendorf&#x27;s pluralist view of class and power structures and belief that hierarchies of authority are inevitable in modern societies also reflect Weberian ideas.

== The Ralf Dahrendorf Prize ==
Since 2019, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) has awarded certain research projects with the Ralf Dahrendorf Prize. The prize honours excellent research and supports the communication of scientific results to the public. Every two years, the BMBF awards prizes to researchers participating in the EU framework programme for research who have achieved exceptional success. The prize awards the winning research project with 50,000 euros, enabling winners to not only continue their research but explore different communication ideas. There is a jury made up of high-class scientists and media personalities that help decide who should receive funding for their projects. The most recent winner of the Ralf Dahrendorf Prize was the Children Born Of War. Children Born Of War – Past, Present, Future, saw researchers from eleven research institutions in the European Union study the life courses of children, fathered by foreign soldiers and born to local mothers, who were conceived during and after armed conflicts – a topic about which families, local communities and entire societies, often remain silent. Examples include children of the occupations during and after the Second World War in Germany and Austria, or children conceived through rape during the Bosnian War.

<doc id="457184" wikidata="Q653404" url="?curid=457184" title="Norval Morrisseau">
<text>Norval Morrisseau (March 14, 1932 – December 4, 2007), also known as Copper Thunderbird, was an Indigenous Canadian artist from the Bingwi Neyaashi Anishinaabek First Nation. He is widely regarded as the grandfather of contemporary Indigenous art in Canada. Known as the &quot;Picasso of the North,&quot; Morrisseau created works depicting the legends of his people, the cultural and political tensions between native Canadian and European traditions, his existential struggles, and his deep spirituality and mysticism. His style is characterized by thick black outlines and bright colors. He founded the Woodlands School of Canadian art and was a prominent member of the “Indian Group of Seven.&quot;

== Biography ==
An Anishinaabe, Morrisseau was born March 14, 1932, on the Sand Point Ojibwe reserve near Beardmore, Ontario. His full name is Jean-Baptiste Norman Henry Morrisseau, but he signs his work using the Cree syllabics writing ᐅᓵᐚᐱᐦᑯᐱᓀᐦᓯ (Ozaawaabiko-binesi, unpointed: ᐅᓴᐘᐱᑯᐱᓀᓯ, &quot;Copper/Brass [Thunder]Bird&quot;), as his pen-name for his Anishnaabe name ᒥᐢᒁᐱᐦᐠ ᐊᓂᒥᐦᑮ (Miskwaabik Animikii, unpointed: ᒥᐢᑿᐱᐠ ᐊᓂᒥᑭ, &quot;Copper Thunderbird&quot;).

In accordance with Anishnaabe tradition, he was raised by his maternal grandparents with little connection to his actual parents. His grandfather, Moses Potan Nanakonagos, a traditional Medicine Man and Knowledge Keeper, taught him the traditions and legends of his people. His grandmother, Véronique Nanakonagos, was a devout Catholic and from her he learned the tenets of Christianity. The contrast between these two religious traditions became an important factor in his intellectual and artistic development.

At the age of six, Morrisseau was sent to a Catholic residential school, St. Joseph&#x27;s Indian Residential School in Fort William, Ontario. There, he and other students were educated in the European tradition, native culture was suppressed, and the use of native language was forbidden. After two years he returned home and started attending a local community school in Beardmore. Morrisseau left the school when he was ten, preferring to learn from elders rather than continuing his formal education. He spent much of his time listening to elders, drawing, fishing, hunting, picking berries, and trapping.

At the age of 19, he became very sick. He was taken to a doctor but his health kept deteriorating. Fearing for his life, his mother called a medicine-woman who performed a renaming ceremony: she gave him the new name &quot;Copper Thunderbird&quot;. According to Anishnaabe tradition, giving a powerful name to a dying person can give them new energy and save their lives. Morrisseau recovered after the ceremony and from then on always signed his works with his new name.

When he started painting, he was discouraged from sharing traditional stories and images outside of the First Nation, but he decided to break this taboo.

Morrisseau contracted tuberculosis in 1956 and was sent to Fort William Sanatorium to recover. There he met his future wife Harriet Kakegamic with whom he had seven children, Victoria, Michael, Peter, David, Lisa, Eugene, and Christian.

After being invited by Ontario Provincial Police Constable, Robert Sheppard, to meet the artist, the anthropologist Selwyn Dewdney became an early advocate of Morrisseau&#x27;s and was very interested in Morrisseau&#x27;s deep knowledge of native culture and myth. Dewdney was the first to take his art to a wider public.

Jack Pollock, a Toronto art dealer, helped expose Morrisseau&#x27;s art to a wider audience in the 1960s. The two initially met in 1962 while Pollock was teaching a painting workshop in Beardmore. As Pollock did not drive, Susan Ross whom Morrisseau had met in 1961 and Sheila Burnford drove Pollock to visit Morrisseau at his home to view more of his works. Struck by the genius of Morrisseau&#x27;s art, he immediately organized an exhibition of his work at his Toronto gallery. One of Morrisseau&#x27;s early commissions was for a large mural in the Indians of Canada Pavilion at Expo 67, a revolutionary exhibit voicing the dissatisfaction of the First Nations People of Canada with their social and political situation.

In 1972, Morrisseau was caught in a hotel fire in Vancouver and suffered serious burns. On that occasion, he had a vision of Jesus encouraging him to be a role model through his art. He converted to the apostolic faith and started introducing Christian themes in his art. A year later he was arrested for drunk and disorderly behaviour and was incarcerated for his own protection. He was assigned an extra cell as a studio and was allowed to attend a nearby church.

Morrisseau joined the Eckankar movement in 1976 and gave up drinking. He connected Eckankar&#x27;s emphasis on soul travel through the astral planes to his traditional Ojibway teachings. 

Morrisseau was the founder of a Canadian-originated school of art called Woodland or sometimes Legend or Medicine painting. His work was influential on a group of younger Ojibwe and Cree artists, such as Blake Debassige, Benjamin Chee Chee, and Leland Bell. His influence on the Woodland school of artists was recognized in 1984 by the Art Gallery of Ontario exhibit &quot;Norval Morrisseau and the Emergence of the Image Makers&quot;. He spent his youth in remote isolation in northern Ontario, near Thunder Bay, where his artistic style developed without the usual influences of other artists&#x27; imagery. As the sole originator of his &quot;Woodland&quot; style he became an inspiration to three generations of artists.
In 1978, Morrisseau was made a Member of the Order of Canada. He was a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts.

As Morrisseau&#x27;s health began to decline as a result of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and a stroke in 1994, he was cared for by his adopted family of Gabe and Michelle Vadas. In 2005 and 2006, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa organized a retrospective of his work. This was the first time that the Gallery dedicated a solo exposition to a native artist. In the final months of his life, the artist used a wheelchair and lived in a residence in Nanaimo, British Columbia. He was unable to paint due to his poor health. He died of cardiac arrest—complications arising from Parkinson&#x27;s disease on December 4, 2007, in Toronto General Hospital. He was buried after a private ceremony in Northern Ontario next to the grave of his former wife, Harriet, on Anishinaabe land.

The National Arts Centre, urban ink co-production, &quot;Copper Thunderbird&quot;, premiered on the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) on Monday, February 4, 2008. Norval Morrisseau was honoured with a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award during the NAAF Awards show in 2008.

== Style ==

Morrisseau was a self-taught artist. He developed his own techniques and artistic vocabulary that captured ancient legends and images that came to him in visions or dreams. He was originally criticized by the native community because his images disclosed traditional spiritual knowledge. Initially he painted on any material that he could find, especially birchbark, and also moose hide. Dewdney encouraged him to use earth-tone colors and traditional material, which he thought were appropriate to Morrisseau&#x27;s native style.

The subjects of his art in the early period were myths and traditions of the Anishnaabe people. He is acknowledged to have initiated the Woodland School of native art, where images similar to the petroglyphs of the Great Lakes region were now captured in paintings and prints. Morrisseau was also inspired by sacred Anishinaabe birch bark scroll images.

His later style changed: he used more standard material and the colors became progressively brighter, eventually obtaining a neon-like brilliance. The themes also moved from traditional myth to depicting his own personal struggles. He also produced art depicting Christian subjects: during his incarceration, he attended a local church where he was struck by the beauty of the images on stained-glass windows. Some of his paintings, like &quot;Indian Jesus Christ&quot;, imitate that style and represent characters from the Bible with native features. After he joined the new age religion Eckankar in 1976, he started representing on canvas its mystical beliefs.

Morrisseau, who was bisexual, also produced erotic works featuring sexuality between male figures and between male and female figures. Most of these works are now held in private collections. Other works explored Indigenous conceptions of gender fluidity, such as his massive work &quot;Androgyny&quot; (1983), which was formerly exhibited at Rideau Hall.

The cover art for the Bruce Cockburn album &quot;Dancing in the Dragon&#x27;s Jaws&quot; is a painting by Norval Morrisseau.

Two of Morrisseau&#x27;s paintings from the mid-1970s appear in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;The Shining&quot; including &quot;The Great Earth Mother&quot; (1976), and &quot;Flock of Loons&quot; (1975).

== Fakes and forgeries ==
The prevalence of fakes and forgeries was of deep concern to Morrisseau, particularly during his later years, and he actively sought to remove these from the marketplace.

In 2005, Morrisseau established the Norval Morrisseau Heritage Society (NMHS). The Society is currently compiling a database of Norval Morrisseau paintings to discredit many prevalent Morrisseau forgeries. This committee, not affiliated with any commercial gallery or art dealer, comprises highly respected members of the academic, legal and Aboriginal communities working on a volunteer basis. It is charged with creating a complete catalogue raisonné of Norval Morrisseau artwork. The NMHS is currently researching Morrisseau art, provenance and materials and techniques in order to complete the task assigned to them by the artist. The NMHS continue their work and in 2008, were in Red Lake, Ontario, to research additional information and art by the artist.
The Art Dealers Association of Canada (ADAC) issued the following directive in the Winter 2007 newsletter to their membership: &quot;The Art Dealers Association of Canada is enacting a rule and regulation that no certificates of authenticity will be issued by any members of ADAC with respect to any works or purported works by Norval Morrisseau and that the Norval Morrisseau Heritage Society is the sole authority for the authentication of works by Norval Morrisseau.&quot; ADAC also revoked the membership of a dealer who failed to comply with this directive.

Morrisseau also engaged in more direct intervention, identifying fake and forged works available for sale, particularly those purported to be painted by him in the so-called &quot;70s style&quot;. He wrote to galleries and made sworn declarations identifying items being sold as &quot;fakes and imitations&quot;. More than ten sworn declarations were directed to at least seven dealers and galleries during 1993–2007, requesting that fake and forged works be removed or destroyed. These dealers were the Artworld of Sherway, Gallery Sunami, Maslak McLeod Gallery, Bearclaw Gallery, Gary Bruce Thacky (AKA Gary Lamont of Thunder Bay, Ontario) and Randy Potter Estate Auctions.

Building on Morrisseau&#x27;s efforts, for the last 20 years, the battle to stop the proliferation of fakes has waged. Lawyers, doctors, Morrisseau&#x27;s friends, apprentice and estate, as well as leading native art scholars, government workers and many others, including musician Kevin Hearn of the Barenaked Ladies, have tried to help in Morrisseau&#x27;s battle by exposing the existence of a fraud ring manufacturing fake Morrisseau paintings. The 2019 documentary film &quot;There Are No Fakes&quot;, directed by Jamie Kastner, helped to bring this issue into the public view. Recently in 2019, after hearing testimony from people inside the fraud ring itself, the Ontario Superior and Appeal courts recognized the existence of that fraud. The courts also found that the Maslak-McLeod Gallery, a vendor of works attributed to Morrisseau, had acted fraudulently.:

“The (previous lower court) trial judge erred in failing to find that the Gallery’s provision of a valid provenance statement was a term of the purchase and a warranty, not mere puffery,” the new appeal decision states.
Mr. McLeod&#x27;s assertion that the painting was genuine was only matched by his elusiveness in demonstrating that fact, which can only be explained as deliberate,” said the appeal panel. “With respect to the provenance statement, Mr. McLeod made a false representation, either knowing that it was false and without an honest belief in its truth, or he made the statement recklessly without caring whether it was true or false, with the intent that Mr. Hearn would rely upon it, which he did, to his personal loss.”
Gallery owner Joseph McLeod is no longer alive; McLeod&#x27;s estate has been ordered to pay Hearn $50,000 for breach of contract and breach of the Sale of Goods Act, plus punitive damages of $10,000.&quot;

The debate concerning the authenticity of the &quot;70s paintings&quot; commonly found in the marketplace, continues with ongoing litigation.

Law enforcement have launched an active investigation into the Norval Morrisseau art fraud as confirmed by the National Post:

&quot;However, police in Thunder Bay say they have now launched a criminal investigation into a possible art fraud ring involving Morrisseau paintings. Spokesman Scott Paradis said Friday investigators are “not prepared to speak about potential suspects or persons of interest.” &quot;The criminal investigation is one of several major developments to take place after what’s shown in the film, which ends with the outcome of the lawsuit.&quot;

On March 3, 2023, the Thunder Bay Police and Ontario Provincial Police announced they had pressed charges against 8 people and seized over 1000 paintings in the forgery cases. Police described it as &quot;the biggest art fraud in world history.&quot;

On December 4, 2023, the 16th anniversary of Norval Morrisseau&#x27;s death in 2007, additional details of the investigation and the art fraud ring emerged with the guilty plea of Gary Lamont, 1 of the 8 people charged in the Norval Morrisseau art forgery case. Lamont pleaded guilty to 2 of 5 charges in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Thunder Bay, Ontario, defrauding the public of an amount exceeding $5,000 and forgery (making false documents, mainly artwork), with the three remaining counts expected to be withdrawn. Lamont was sentenced to 5 years in prison on fraud charges.

The joint operation, between the OPP and the Thunder Bay Police Service, called Project Totton, took years and laid 40 charges against Lamont and 7 other still alleged forgers operating in Thunder Bay and Southern Ontario. Police estimated the total number of forgeries at between 4,500 and 6,000, worth tens of millions of dollars, and described the crime as one of the biggest cases of art fraud anywhere in the world.

The forgery lasted from 2002 until 2015, according to the charges, while the public defrauding extended from 2002 through to 2019. Police said the eight accused were part of three distinct, yet intertwined groups that created the fraudulent artwork. The first group was launched in 1996 and operated in Thunder Bay like an assembly line. Another group started in 2002, and third group began operating in southern Ontario in 2008. The three groups traded paintings back and forth, and two of the accused were involved in the distribution of paintings by all three groups. The fraud also included creating fake certificates of authenticity, police said. Others charged in the case are David John Voss, Diane Marie Champagne, Linda Joy Tkachyk and Benjamin Paul Morrisseau (the artist&#x27;s nephew), all of Thunder Bay. Also charged are Jeffrey Gordon Cowan of Niagara-on-the-Lake, James White of Essa Township and David P. Bremner of Locust Hill.

<doc id="457192" wikidata="Q420785" url="?curid=457192" title="System 6">
<text>System 6 (or System Software 6) is the sixth major release of the classic Mac OS operating system for Macintosh computers, made by Apple Computer. It was released in 1988. It is a monolithic operating system, with cooperative multitasking based on an improved MultiFinder. The boxed version cost , and it was included with all new Macintosh computers until 1991, when it was succeeded by System 7.

==Overview==

===MacroMaker===
The MacroMaker utility was introduced in System 6. It records mouse and keyboard input as macros, and has a unique user interface intended to look and act like a tape recorder. MacroMaker was criticized for its lack of features when compared to Microsoft&#x27;s AutoMac III, which was already available commercially. As MacroMaker records only the locations of mouse-clicks inside windows and not what is being clicked on or exactly when, it can not be used to automate actions in more sophisticated programs. The pre-recorded clicks miss buttons if the buttons had moved since the recording, or if they failed to appear upon playback. It records the start and end locations of mouse movements, but does not track the precise path of a movement or support pauses. MacroMaker is not compatible with System 7, in which it is succeeded by AppleScript.

===Multitasking===
Macintosh gained cooperative multitasking in March 1985 with Andy Hertzfeld&#x27;s Switcher, which can switch between multiple full-screen applications. It was not integrated, and was only sold separately by Apple. Not many programs and features function correctly with Switcher, and it does not share the screen between applications simultaneously. Systems 5 and 6 have MultiFinder instead, which is much more mature and widely used in System 6. With MultiFinder, the Finder does not quit to free resources, and the system behaves as in the still-familiar multitasking fashion, with the desktop and other applications&#x27; windows in the background.

===Hardware support===
System 6 includes support for the Apple ImageWriter LQ and PostScript laser printers. New software drivers allow the ImageWriter LQ to be used on AppleTalk local area networks and supports the use of tabloid or B-size paper (). System 6 includes QuickerGraf (originally QuickerDraw), system software used to accelerate the drawing of color images on the Macintosh II. It was licensed to Apple and Radius Inc. by its programmer, Andy Hertzfeld.

===Limitations===
In comparison to the NeXTSTEP operating system of the time, System 6 does not make much use of sound, and its user interface is limited in file management and window displays. System 6&#x27;s Apple menu cannot be used to launch applications. The icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar simply shows the open application and is not a menu. System 6 supports 24 bits of addressable RAM (random-access memory), which allows for a maximum of 8 megabytes of RAM, with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were removed in System 7. System 6&#x27;s version of the HFS file system also has a volume size limit; it supports up to 2 gigabytes (GB) and 65,536 files on any one volume. System 7.5 increased this limit to 4 GB, and 7.5.2 increased it further to 2 TB on certain machines, specifically PCI-based Macintosh models.

The Trash (known as the &quot;Wastebasket&quot; in the British-English version) empties when the Finder terminates. Icons on the Desktop in System 6 are not organized into a single folder, as in later operating systems. Instead, the system records if a file is on the Desktop. This is inefficient and confusing, as the user cannot browse to the Desktop in applications besides the Finder, even within the standard &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Save As&quot; dialog boxes. Furthermore, these dialogs are primitive, and were mostly unchanged since 1984. The lack of aliases, shortcuts to files, is another limitation of file management on System 6, and custom file and folder icons are not supported. These issues were all remedied in System 7.

A maximum of 15 desk accessories may be installed at one time, including the Chooser, Scrapbook, and Control Panel. System 6 uses the Control Panel desk accessory to access all the installed control panels, which imposes severe user-interface limitations. In System 7, Control Panels are contained in separately openable panels, and are held in a central folder for better organization. Desk Accessories cannot be installed or removed within the Finder; this requires the Font/DA Mover utility. System 7 also fixed this.

The interface is not very customizable. The Finder allows each icon to be assigned a color, but the desktop background is limited to an 8x8-pixel color tiled pattern (color patterns were introduced in System 5), and standard window frames are black-and-white. However, many &quot;INIT&quot; extension files exist to add color and customization. System 7 allows the user to change the color of window frames and various other aspects of the user interface. By 1989, the System 6 user interface was in need of a change.

==Reception==
Initial releases of System 6 are unstable; Don Crabb of &quot;BYTE&quot; described 6.0 as &quot;buggy and unreliable&quot;. Many third-party developers did not receive advance copies, resulting in widespread compatibility issues. The contemporary versions of many common programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software bugs in the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed with version 6.0.1 update, in September 1988. However, a major bug involving the text-spacing of screen fonts was found, and was fixed in version 6.0.2, which Crabb described as &quot;a &quot;huge&quot; improvement&quot; over 6.0. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of its poor reputation.

==Compatibility==
System 6 was officially supported by Apple for many different machines, some of which shipped with it. Some unsupported Macintosh computers can run it with limitations.

<text>Fen Causeway or the Fen Road is the modern name for a Roman road of England that runs between Denver, Norfolk in the east and Peterborough in the west. Its path covers , passing March and Eldernell (near Whittlesey) before joining the major Roman north–south route Ermine Street west of modern-day Peterborough. It provided a link from the north and west of England to East Anglia.

It is possible that the route continued east of Denver to meet Peddars Way at Castle Acre, but the evidence for this is less certain.

The road is thought to have been raised above the marshy fens using gravel, with a width of up to . Towards its western end it is close to the Bronze Age route across Flag Fen. At that archaeological site, which is open to visitors, a section through the Roman Road can be seen.

<doc id="457202" wikidata="Q4984282" url="?curid=457202" title="Buddhist view of marriage">
<text>Buddhism considers marriage a secular affair and as such, it is not considered a sacrament. Buddhists are expected to follow the civil laws regarding marriage laid out by their respective governments.

While the ceremony itself is civil, many Buddhists obtain the blessing from monks at the local temple after the marriage is completed.

==History==

Gautama Buddha never spoke against marriage but instead pointed out some of the difficulties of marriage. He is quoted in the Parabhava Sutta as saying:

==Views==

While Buddhism may neither encourage nor discourage getting married, it does provide principles regarding it. 

In the Sigalovada Sutta (Digha Nikaya 31), Gautama Buddha advised husbands to honor and respect their wives, be faithful, and share authority in managing household affairs. Similarly, wives were encouraged to perform their duties well, be hospitable to relatives, and be faithful and industrious.

===In Tibetan Buddhism===
The Dalai Lama has spoken of the merits of marriage:

==Same Sex Marriage==
The Pali Canon (the standard collection of scriptures in the Theravada Buddhist tradition, as preserved in the Pāli language, and the most complete extant early Buddhist canon) bars both female and male monastics from both homosexual and heterosexual activities. 

Among Buddhists there is a wide diversity of opinion about homosexuality and gay marriage. According to the Pāli Canon and Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is not any saying that same-sex or opposite sex relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct. Scholars argue that early Buddhism did not see sexual orientation as a moral issue and that tolerance aligns with core values of Buddhism as a whole. As such, Buddhist attitudes towards homosexuality are often a reflection of local culture rather than Buddhist teachings. The history of homosexuality in Buddhist societies includes cultures of acceptable and non-acceptance in different locations and times.

=== Opposition ===
The Dalai Lama once stated:

However, the Dalai Lama later clarified his position stating gay marriage is &quot;OK&quot;, provided it&#x27;s not in contradiction with the values of one&#x27;s chosen religion. Some contemporary Buddhists oppose or opposed same-sex marriage including Chan master Hsuan Hua.

=== Support ===
Some of the first gay marriages of the modern period were performed by Buddhists. The first known modern Buddhist same-sex marriage took place in the early 1970s through the Buddhist Church of San Francisco part of the Shin Tradition. Prominent contemporary supporters of the rights of the rights of gay and lesbians include Nalandabodhi sangha who has stated that they are welcoming of all sexual orientations and well-known Bhutanese lama Khyentse Norbu has expressed support for LGBT rights in Bhutan. Hsing Yun, founder of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order, has called for tolerance towards the LGBT community. The Plum Village Tradition founded by founded by Thích Nhất Hạnh and Chân Không formally accepts LGBT individuals starting an initiative called &quot;The Rainbow Family&quot;.

Heavily Buddhist Taiwan legalized same-sex marriage in 2019 with the prominent support of Buddhist Nun Chao-hwei Shih. Nepal, a country with relatively significant Buddhist influences, legalized Same-sex marriage on 24th April, 2024. Heavily Buddhist Thailand legalized same-sex marriage in 2024. Same-sex marriages are also performed in places where it is not yet recognized, for example, same-sex marriages are performed at Shunkō-in, a Rinzai Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto and Shozenji Temple in Moriguchi City, Osaka. The Buddhist Church of San Francisco first performed a gay marriage ceremony in the 1970s while American Soka Gakkai Buddhists have performed same-sex union ceremonies since the 1990s. There has also been support for sam-sex marriage from the European Buddhist Union the Buddhist Churches of America, many Shin Buddhist groups, and The Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils (FABC) in Australia.

==Divorce==
Since marriage is secular, Buddhism has no restrictions on divorce. Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda has said &quot;if a husband and wife really cannot live together, instead of leading a miserable life and harboring more jealousy, anger and hatred, they should have the liberty to separate and live peacefully.&quot;

<text>Fiona Thornewill (born 10 July 1966) is an English explorer who reached the South Pole solo and unaided in a record 42 days in 2004, walking and skiing over 700 miles in the process.

==Background==
Born in Upton, Nottinghamshire, England, Fiona was into sports as a child, especially gymnastics, horse-racing and ice-skating. She attended Lowes Wong Junior School in nearby Southwell before going to The Rodney School in Kirklington.

Later, Fiona worked as an administrator for the RAF where she able to gain experience in flying and gliding. She also opened her own gymnasium, but tragedy struck when her husband, Bill, was killed in a road accident.

In 1992, Fiona met her present husband, Mike, who introduced her to outdoor sports such as mountaineering. Mike also had ambitions to cross the South Pole overland, and these plans encouraged Fiona to follow suit.

==Expeditions==
In 2000, Michael and Fiona became the first married couple to reach the South Pole, along with Catherine Hartley.

In 2001, Mike and Fiona set up an expedition to reach the North Pole, raising money for charity in the process. Guiding them was Canadian mountaineer and arctic adventurer Paul Landry. They reached their destination in 56 days.

Fiona&#x27;s greatest feat came in 2200
 though, when from the edge of the continent at Hercules Inlet, she reached the South Pole in 41 days on 10 January, beating her rival Rosie Stancer in the process. The previous record was 44 days, and the previous best for a woman was 50 days – by the Norwegian Liv Arneson. Walking 22 miles a day, Fiona had to pull a sledge weighing 285 pounds, and her success is perhaps even more remarkable considering she lost her satellite navigation system 10 days in. Base camp then had to follow Fiona&#x27;s mandatory emergency beacon, which showed location, and temperature only, via satellite link.

As news reached home she was congratulated by friends and family, and husband Mike was part of a party racing to meet her on Antarctica.

<text>Adam Ries (17 January 1492 – 30 March 1559) was a German mathematician. He is also known by the name Adam Riese. He is known as the &quot;father of modern calculating&quot; because of his decisive contribution to the recognition that Roman numerals are unpractical and to their replacement by the considerably more practical Arabic numerals.

== Life ==
Almost nothing is known about Ries&#x27; childhood, youth and education. The exact year of his birth is not known. The caption on the only known contemporary portrait of the mathematician reads: ANNO 1550 ADAM RIES SEINS ALTERS IM LVIII. So apparently he was in his 58th year of age at the time of the picture, which was made in 1550. From this it can be deduced that he was born in 1492 or 1493.

The location of his birth, Staffelstein, can be determined with certainty, since he gives information about himself in the preface to his book, &quot;Coß&quot;. His father was the owner of the mill there, Contz Ries, and his mother, Eva Kittler, was his father&#x27;s second wife.

The first decades after Ries&#x27; birth are not documented, so it is not known which schools he attended. There is also no information about his studies in the matriculation registers of the universities.

The first time that Adam Ries was mentioned in a document was on 22 April 1517, when he appeared before the Council of Staffelstein because of a dispute over an inheritance. By 1509, he was already living in Zwickau with his younger brother, Conrad, who attended the Latin school there. In 1518, Ries went to Erfurt, where he ran a mathematics school, and he wrote two of his mathematics books and had them published there.

In 1522 or 1523, he moved to the newly founded mining town of Annaberg where he spent the rest of his life. There he finished work on the manuscript of his algebra textbook, &quot;Coß&quot;, in 1524, although the book was not published until 1992 by B.G. Teubner. During this time, Ries became acquainted with Anna Leuber, the daughter of Freiberg master fitter, Andreas Leuber. The wedding of the couple was mentioned in the register of the St. Anne&#x27;s Church in Annaberg in 1525. In the same year, he took the oath of citizenship, purchased a house in &quot;Johannisgasse&quot; in Annaberg and settled down. He first earned his living as a &quot;Rezessschreiber&quot; (a person who checked the calculations of the mines), and later as a &quot;Gegenschreiber&quot; (a bookkeeper of the mines) and &quot;Zehntner&quot; (regional financial administrator). In 1539, he bought &quot;Riesenburg&quot;, a small castle outside of the town, whose buildings still bear his name today. After his last work appeared in print in 1550, Ries died on 30 March 1559. Because of scanty information, it is not known where he is buried, whether in Annaberg, the Riesenburg or elsewhere.

=== Family ===


Ries and his wife had at least eight children. Three of the five sons, Adam, Abraham, and Jacob, were all active as mathematicians in Annaberg at times. While Abraham and Jacob died in their home town in 1604, Adam is supposed to have settled in the Harz mountains. The fourth son, Isaac, moved to Leipzig, where he was active as a &quot;Visierer&quot; (a master of weights and measures). Paul, the fifth son, was a landowner and judge in Wiesa. The three daughters, Eva, Anna and Sybilla, all married in Annaberg.

Adam Ries&#x27; descendants are the subject of constant, detailed genealogical research. Great numbers of his descendants still live in the upper Ore Mountains today. The Adam-Ries-Bund (Adam Ries Association, see external links) has taken on the task of researching all of the descendants of Adam Ries and, to date, has more than 20,000 direct descendants in its continually updated database.

=== Works ===
* &quot;Rechnung auff der linihen&quot; (1518): In it, Ries describes calculating on the lines of a calculating board, a kind of abacus. According to the foreword of the second edition, it was expressly intended for children.
* &quot;Rechnung auff der linihen und federn...&quot; (1522): Besides calculating on the calculating board, he describes numerical calculations with Indian/Arabic digits. The intended readers were the apprentices of businessmen and craftsmen. Until now, it has been published 114 times.
* &quot;Coß&quot; (manuscript 1524, printed in 1992): The algebra textbook is named after the common name for the unknown variable in the German Middle Ages, and it establishes the connection between medieval and modern algebra.
* &quot;Ein Gerechent Büchlein/ auff den Schöffel/ Eimer/ vnd Pfundtgewicht...&quot; (manuscript 1533, printed in 1536): A book with tables for calculating everyday prices; a kind of guide which, according to Ries&#x27; foreword, helps &quot;that the poor common man not be cheated when buying bread.&quot; Also known by the name of &quot;Annaberger Brotordnung&quot;.
* &quot;Rechenung nach der lenge/ auff den Linihen vnd Feder.&quot; (1550): Often cited under the shortened title, &quot;Practica&quot;. The book also shows a portrait of the author for the first time, which is the only contemporary picture of Ries at all, and also gives an indication of the year of his birth.

Ries did not write his works in Latin, as was usual at that time, but in German.

== Name ==
Since the spelling of names was not as fixed at that time as it is today, the contemporary spellings &quot;Ris, &quot;Rise&quot;, &quot;Ryse&quot; and even &quot;Reyeß&quot; are also sometimes found.

In today&#x27;s usage, both variants of his name, &quot;Ries&quot; and &quot;Riese&quot;, can be found. The latter is usual in the German expression &quot;nach Adam Riese&quot; which means &quot;according to Adam Ries&quot; and it is used when speaking about simple arithmetic, e.g. &quot;zwei und zwei macht, nach Adam Riese, vier&quot; (&quot;two plus two is, according to Adam Ries, four&quot;). Furthermore, the German word &quot;Riese&quot; can be translated as &quot;giant&quot; in English, thus inspiring a common tongue-in-cheek adaptation of the beforementioned saying, &quot;nach Adam Riese und Eva Zwerg&quot; (&quot;according to Adam Giant and Eve Dwarf).

== Honours &amp; Monuments ==

The Nysa family main-belt asteroid 7655 Adamries was named after him in 1997.

=== Annaberg ===
* 1893: Bust by Robert Henze

On the occasion of the 400th birthday of Adam Ries, the Annaberg Historical Society decided in 1891 to put up a monument to the mathematician. The sculpture by the Dresden sculptor, Henze, was not dedicated until 5 November 1893 because of financial difficulties. In 1943, the bronze bust was melted to make armaments and it was replaced ten years later by a sandstone copy. At the end of the 1970s, this was completely removed from the town because of fears that its condition would continue to deteriorate due to the material. In 1991, a new sandstone bust was exhibited in its current position. After severe damage by vandalism in 1992, it was once again reconstructed through the initiative of the Adam Ries Association, and it was once again placed before the church on the 100th anniversary of the first dedication.

=== Staffelstein ===

* 1874: Plaque in the Town Hall
* 1959: Sandstone relief by Karl Potzler at the Town Hall
* 1980: Bronze relief by Hubert Weber at the savings bank branch on &quot;Bamberger Straße&quot;
* 1990: Bronze relief by Huber Weber in front of the savings bank branch on &quot;Bahnhofstraße&quot;
* 1992: Bronze plaque at the entrance to the Raiffeisen bank, the location of the house where Adam Ries is presumed to have been born

=== Erfurt ===

* 1992: Three-part ensemble, with bronze bust, text plaque and calculating table set into the surface of the road on Michaelisstraße 48

== Postage Stamps ==

* The German Post Office issued two postage stamps in honor of Adam Ries in 1959 and 1992 (Michel catalog no. 308 and 1612).

<doc id="457210" wikidata="Q837863" url="?curid=457210" title="Pure mathematics">
<text>Pure mathematics is the study of mathematical concepts independently of any application outside mathematics. These concepts may originate in real-world concerns, and the results obtained may later turn out to be useful for practical applications, but pure mathematicians are not primarily motivated by such applications. Instead, the appeal is attributed to the intellectual challenge and aesthetic beauty of working out the logical consequences of basic principles.

While pure mathematics has existed as an activity since at least ancient Greece, the concept was elaborated upon around the year 1900, after the introduction of theories with counter-intuitive properties (such as non-Euclidean geometries and Cantor&#x27;s theory of infinite sets), and the discovery of apparent paradoxes (such as continuous functions that are nowhere differentiable, and Russell&#x27;s paradox). This introduced the need to renew the concept of mathematical rigor and rewrite all mathematics accordingly, with a systematic use of axiomatic methods. This led many mathematicians to focus on mathematics for its own sake, that is, pure mathematics.

Nevertheless, almost all mathematical theories remained motivated by problems coming from the real world or from less abstract mathematical theories. Also, many mathematical theories, which had seemed to be totally pure mathematics, were eventually used in applied areas, mainly physics and computer science. A famous early example is Isaac Newton&#x27;s demonstration that his law of universal gravitation implied that planets move in orbits that are conic sections, geometrical curves that had been studied in antiquity by Apollonius. Another example is the problem of factoring large integers, which is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem, widely used to secure internet communications.

It follows that, currently, the distinction between pure and applied mathematics is more a philosophical point of view or a mathematician&#x27;s preference rather than a rigid subdivision of mathematics.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. Plato helped to create the gap between &quot;arithmetic&quot;, now called number theory, and &quot;logistic&quot;, now called arithmetic. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who &quot;must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops&quot; and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers &quot;because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being.&quot; Euclid of Alexandria, when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, &quot;since he must make gain of what he learns.&quot; The Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of &quot;Conics&quot; to which he proudly asserted,
They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.
And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of &quot;Conics&quot; that the subject is one of those that &quot;...seem worthy of study for their own sake.&quot;

===19th century===
The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the Sadleirian Chair, &quot;Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics&quot;, founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of &quot;pure&quot; mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of Gauss made no sweeping distinction of the kind between &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;applied&quot;. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the Weierstrass approach to mathematical analysis) started to make a rift more apparent.

===20th century===
At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the axiomatic method, strongly influenced by David Hilbert&#x27;s example. The logical formulation of pure mathematics suggested by Bertrand Russell in terms of a quantifier structure of propositions seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of &quot;rigorous proof&quot;.

Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the Bourbaki group, is what is proved. &quot;Pure mathematician&quot; became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.

The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in engineering education:

:There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give.

==Generality and abstraction==

One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:

* Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures
* Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow.
* One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics.
* Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. Category theory is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math.

Generality&#x27;s impact on intuition is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style. Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.

As a prime example of generality, the Erlangen program involved an expansion of geometry to accommodate non-Euclidean geometries as well as the field of topology, and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a group of transformations. The study of numbers, called algebra at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to abstract algebra at a more advanced level; and the study of functions, called calculus at the college freshman level becomes mathematical analysis and functional analysis at a more advanced level. Each of these branches of more &quot;abstract&quot; mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in abstraction was seen mid 20th century.

In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from physics, particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by Vladimir Arnold, as too much Hilbert, not enough Poincaré. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that string theory pulls one way, while discrete mathematics pulls back towards proof as central.

==Pure vs. applied mathematics==
Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in G.H. Hardy&#x27;s 1940 essay &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Apology&quot;.

It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to painting and poetry, Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express &quot;physical&quot; truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called &quot;real&quot; mathematics, &quot;which has permanent aesthetic value&quot;, and &quot;the dull and elementary parts of mathematics&quot; that have practical use.

Hardy considered some physicists, such as Einstein and Dirac, to be among the &quot;real&quot; mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing his &quot;Apology&quot;, he considered general relativity and quantum mechanics to be &quot;useless&quot;, which allowed him to hold the opinion that only &quot;dull&quot; mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of matrix theory and group theory to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, &quot;real&quot; mathematics may be useful as well.

Another insightful view is offered by American mathematician Andy Magid:
Friedrich Engels argued in his 1878 book &quot;Anti-Dühring&quot; that &quot;it is not at all true that in pure mathematics the mind deals only with its own creations and imaginations. The concepts of number and figure have not been invented from any source other than the world of reality&quot;. He further argued that &quot;Before one came upon the idea of deducing the form of a cylinder from the rotation of a rectangle about one of its sides, a number of real rectangles and cylinders, however imperfect in form, must have been examined. Like all other sciences, mathematics arose out of the needs of men...But, as in every department of thought, at a certain stage of development the laws, which were abstracted from the real world, become divorced from the real world, and are set up against it as something independent, as laws coming from outside, to which the world has to conform.&quot;

However generally, from a purely legal standpoint, &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; is a &quot;lay term&quot; which represents a boundary that has been broken, dictated by a moral set of conduct, particularly where the situation is normally non-sexual and therefore unusual for sexual behavior, or where there is some aspect of personal power or authority that makes sexual behavior inappropriate. A common theme, and the reason for the term &quot;misconduct&quot;, is that these violations occur during work or in a situation of a power imbalance (such as sexual harassment).

The alleged misconduct can be of various degrees, such as exposure of genitals, assault, aggressive come-ons, pleading, or even inattentiveness to nonverbal cues of discomfort. The &quot;definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear&quot; and it is a &quot;lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies&quot;, to deal with cases marked by power imbalance, coercion, and predatory behaviour.&quot;

==Definitions==
In the legal sense, for a person in a position of authority it includes in particular any sexual activity between them and one of their subordinates. This commonly includes teachers and their students, clergy and their congregants, doctors and their patients, and employers and their employees. While such activity is usually not explicitly illegal, it is often against professional ethical codes. For example, a teacher may be fired and a doctor may have their medical license revoked because of sexual misconduct. In addition, the person in the subordinate position may allege sexual harassment. The University of Iowa defines sexual misconduct as &quot;...unwelcome behavior of a sexual nature that is committed without consent or by force, intimidation, coercion, or manipulation.&quot;

Entering a sexual relationship with a subordinate, even when the contact is initiated by the latter, is considered unethical by some because of the subordinate&#x27;s vulnerability to the superior and the inequality of power that characterizes the relationship. In the case of the doctor-patient relationship, having a sexual relationship with the patient even after the professional relationship has concluded is considered problematic for the physician because of the potential for the patient&#x27;s continuing dependence on and transference towards the physician. Therefore, sexual relationships with former patients are considered unethical by the medical profession when physicians &quot;use or exploit the trust, knowledge, emotions or influence derived from the previous professional relationship&quot; in any way. By contrast, legal ethics permit sexual relations with former client and, in California, with current clients as well so long as the sex is consensual and is not rendered in exchange for legal services.

Some activities which are not strictly erotic, e.g. mooning (exposing the buttocks), streaking (running naked through a public area) and skinny dipping (swimming naked), are sometimes also categorized as sexual misconduct. Despite these opinions, others believe that sexual relations in workplace settings is not unethical including between boss and employee. Many companies do not prohibit so-called fraternization but instead recognize the difference between consensual dating and improper behavior.

According to Joanne Laucius from the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, the &quot;definition of sexual misconduct is far from clear&quot; and the &quot;word &#x27;misconduct&#x27; also lacks precision — it can be used as a catch-all for all kinds of behaviour, often obscuring what actually happened&quot;. Laucius states that the terms &quot;sexual violence or sexual harassment and assault are much more specific terms that convey the nature of the allegations.&quot; Elaine Craig, an associate professor in the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, states that &quot;[s]exual misconduct is a lay term, sometimes used in institutional policies or by professional bodies. It covers an array of problematic sexual behaviour including sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual abuse. Two of these terms have specific (and different) legal meanings: Sexual assault has a specific meaning in the criminal law context, unlike sexual misconduct, which may cover both criminal and non-criminal conduct.&quot;

Elizabeth Sheehy, the Shirley Greenberg Chair for Women and the Legal Profession at the University of Ottawa, states that &quot;[s]exual misconduct is a social issue and not a fixed line—it shifts as women gain access to economic and political equality. It&#x27;s not found under criminal law, in human rights codes, or collective agreements. It might be found under professional disciplinary codes.&quot; She states that &quot;we don&#x27;t have a consensus on it, either&quot;, &quot;...except that there are three key considerations. First, a power imbalance. Second, coercion, whether implicit or explicit. Third, predatory behaviour.&quot; Ally Crockford, a public educator at the Ottawa Rape Crisis Centre, states that &quot;[s]exual misconduct is... a catch-all for behaviour that is not OK, but it&#x27;s unclear how it should be classified. It could be any number of things—someone is made to feel uncomfortable, or they feel they are being watched or looked at in a certain way.&quot;

Michelle Cottle wrote in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that the &quot;...almost infinite shades of creepy misbehavior on display are challenging the legal and cultural categories used to describe them&quot;, as this issue is, in &quot;...some ways, uncharted territory&quot;, making it &quot;...hard to tell how the new lines will be drawn, much less where.&quot; Cottle states that &quot;[m]illennials and younger Gen Xers seem to have a broader definition of what constitutes harassment as well as less hesitation about discussing their experiences&quot;.

==In education==

A literature review of educator sexual misconduct published by the US Department of Education in 2004 written by researcher Charol Shakeshaft found that 9.6% of high school students have experienced some form of sexual misconduct. Black, Hispanic, and Native American Indian children are at greatest risk for sexual abuse. Also at increased risk are children with disabilities; the reason for this may be their greater need for individual attention and their possible problems with communicating.

<doc id="457216" wikidata="Q170309" url="?curid=457216" title="Baghlan Province">
<text>Baghlan (Dari and ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan and located in northeastern Afghanistan. As of 2020, the province has a population of about 1,014,634.

Its capital is Puli Khumri, but its name comes from the other major town in the province, Baghlan. The ruins of a Zoroastrian fire temple, the Surkh Kotal, are located in Baghlan. The lead nation of the local Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) was Hungary, which operated from 2006 to 2015.

==History==
===Early history===
The name Baghlan is derived from &quot;Bagolango&quot; or &quot;image-temple&quot;, inscribed on the temple of Surkh Kotal during the reign of the Kushan emperor Kanishka in the early 2nd century CE. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang traveled through Baghlan in the mid-7th century CE, and referred to it as the &quot;kingdom of &quot;Fo-kia-lang&quot;&quot;.

In the 13th century CE, a permanent garrison of Mongol troops was quartered in the Kunduz-Baghlan area, and in 1253 fell under the jurisdiction of Sali Noyan Tatar, appointed by Möngke Khan. Sali Noyan&#x27;s position was later inherited by his son Uladu and grandson Baktut. These Turco-Mongol garrison troops (&quot;tamma&quot;) formed the Qara&#x27;unas faction, and by the 14th Century had allied with the Chaghataite Khanate. Under the rule of Temür the Qara&#x27;unas were given to Chekü Barlas, and then to his son Jahānshāh. Beatrice Forbes Manz notes that these Kunduz-Baghlan forces appear to have remained cohesive and influential throughout the Timurid period, though under different leaders and different names, up until the Uzbek invasion. By the Islamic year 900 (1494–1495 CE), the area was noted in the &quot;Baburnama&quot; as ruled by a Qipchaq emir.

===20th century===
In the mid-20th century, as Afghanistan became the target of international development from both the Western and Soviet world, agricultural-industrial projects were initiated in Baghlan. These included factories for the production of sugar from sugar beets (initiated by Czech experts in the 1940s) and for vegetable oil. Czech expertise also figured heavily into the development of Baghlans&#x27; coal-mining industry, centred at Baghlan&#x27;s Karkar Valley, the only coal mine in Afghanistan to remain operational up through 1992.

The modern Baghlan Province was created out of the former Qataghan Province in 1964.

During the Soviet–Afghan War, the Soviets in 1982 established the Kayan military zone in southern Baghlan. The area was defended by 10,000 Ismaili militiamen, increasing to 18,000 by 1992, who sided with the Soviets due to differences with the Islamist opposition. Afghan Ismailis overall were inclined to support the Communists, though a local Ismaili leader, Sayed Manuchehr, lead a partisan movement against the Communists until Ismaili leader Sayed Mansur Naderi accepted Soviet support.

Large portions of Baghlan and neighbouring Samangan Province were under the sway of the Soviet-aligned Naderi clan, the hereditary Ismaili Sayeds (spiritual leaders) of Kayan. Under their jurisdiction, was largely quiet and societally functional throughout the 1980s, with hospitals, schools, and administrative services, funded by the communist central government. Despite the Naderi&#x27;s alliance with the Communists, they also maintained positive relations with the Mujahideen as well, permitting them to move through the area provided they refrained from attacks.

One of the Soviets&#x27; three primary bases in Afghanistan, Kiligai, was located in Baghlan Province, and served as the &quot;largest military supply and armoury centre of the Soviet troops in Afghanistan.&quot;

The capital of Baghlan province was officially transferred to the city of Puli Khumri from the central city of Baghlan. This transition occurred during the 1980s under the influence of Sayed Mansur Naderi, son of Sayed Kayan, who held significant military and political power at the time. The relocation aimed to enhance public access to administrative offices, leveraging Puli Khumri&#x27;s strategic location along the Kabul-Mazar highway. The cabinet of Dr. Najibullah, led by Sultan Ali Keshtmand, initially proposed this move through declaration number 492 on March 1, 1989. It was subsequently formalized by Dr. Najibullah through decree number 1603 on March 9, 1989.

===Recent history===

As the 2001 Afghan War commenced, Ismaili leader Sayed Mansoor Naderi attempted to retake Baghlan from the Taliban. Naderi was aligned with Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Jumbesh-e Milli party, and the competing Tajik-dominated Jamiat-e Islami party was also keen to seize control of Baghlan as Taliban power eroded. The Jamiat were able to seize the capital of Pul-i Khumri before Naderi, who despite his strong backing among the Afghan Ismailis and Shia Hazaras, was unable to rally enough supporters to control the province. Naderi failed to retake the capital in 2001 and 2003, in the latter event he negotiated a power-sharing agreement with the dominant Andarabi militias and made the Ismaili bastion of the Kayan Valley his base.

On 13 June 2012, two earthquakes hit Afghanistan and there was a major landslide in Burka District of Baghlan Province. The village of Sayi Hazara was buried under up to 30 meters of rock, killing an estimated 71 people.

On 13 April 2021, an official in Baghlan Province said a group of Taliban militants attacked a checkpoint in the province that day and killed six security personnel.

Claiming that the Taliban had not acted in the spirit of amnesty, the Public&#x27;s Resistance Forces under Khair Muhammad Andarabi reportedly attacked Taliban fighters 20 August 2021 in several parts of Baghlan province, inflicting up to 60 Taliban killed or wounded. They claim to have captured Puli Hisar, Dih Salah and Banu districts, and are advancing on other Taliban-held districts. Clashes were still reported in Baghlan province by January 2022.

==Warlord of Kayan==

The &quot;Warlord of Kayan&quot; is a significant and popular documentary movie, filmed in 1989 by Jeff B. Harmon, featuring the political and social landscape of Baghlan during the civil wars. The former governor of Baghlan Sayed Jafar Naderi was chosen as the central character in this documentary. He, who was also known as Jeff Naderi outside the borders of Afghanistan, is the son of Sayed Mansur Naderi, an influential political and religious figure. The film won the Golden Gate Award at the San Francisco International Film Festival.

The film was also featured in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; magazine and a picture of Sayed Jafar Naderi taken by Jeff B. Harmon during one of the filmmaking scenes had gone on the magazine&#x27;s front cover. Hard copies of magazine collected by Magazine Canteen are still available.

Taj Mohammad Jahid has been the governor of the province since July 2020.

<text>Balkh (Dari and , ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the north of the country. It is divided into 15 districts and has a population of about 1,509,183, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a Persian-speaking society. The city of Mazar-i-Sharif is the capital and largest city of the province. The Mawlana Jalaluddin Mohammad Balkhi International Airport and Camp Marmal sit on the eastern edge of Mazar-i-Sharif.

Balkh, also called Vazīrābād, the name of the province is derived from the ancient city of Balkh, near the modern town. The city of Mazar-e-Sharif has been an important stop on the trade routes from the Far East to the Middle East, the Mediterranean and Europe. Home to the famous blue mosque, it was once destroyed by Genghis Khan but later rebuilt by Timur. The city of Balkh and the area of Balkh Province were considered a part of various historical regions in history including Ariana and Greater Khorasan.

The province serves today as Afghanistan&#x27;s second but main gateway to Central Asia, the other being Sherkhan Bandar in the Kunduz Province. Balkh Province borders Jowzjan, Sar-e Pol, Samangan and Kunduz provinces, and the Surxondaryo Region of Uzbekistan to the north; making it the only province of Afghanistan to share a border with Uzbekistan.

==Geography==

Balkh Province is situated in the northern part of Afghanistan, bordering Turkmenistan in the north-west, bordering Uzbekistan in the north, Tajikistan in the north-east, Kunduz Province in the east, Samangan Province in the south-east, Sar-e Pol Province in the south-west and Jowzjan Province in the west. The province covers an area of 16,840 km2. Nearly half of the province is mountainous or semi-mountainous terrain (48.7%) while half of the area (50.2%) is made up of flat land.

==History==

===Ancient history===
The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC, also known as the &quot;Oxus civilization&quot;) is the modern archaeological designation for a Bronze Age culture of Central Asia, dated to –1700 BCE, located in present-day Turkmenistan, northern Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, centered on the upper Amu Darya (Oxus), in area covering ancient Bactria. Its sites were discovered and named by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi (1976). Bactria was the Greek name for the area of &quot;Bakhlo&quot; (modern Balkh), in what is now northern Afghanistan, and &quot;Margiana&quot; was the Greek name for the Persian satrapy of Margu, the capital of which was Merv, in today&#x27;s Turkmenistan.

The early Greek historian Ctesias c. 400 BCE (followed by Diodorus Siculus) alleged that the legendary Assyrian king Ninus had defeated a Bactrian king named Oxyartes in ca. 2140 BC, or some 1000 years before the Trojan War. Ever since the discovery of cuneiform enabled actual Assyrian records to be deciphered in the 19th century, however, historians have ascribed little value to the Greek account.

According to some writers, Bactria was the homeland of Indo-European tribes who moved south-west into what is today Iran and into the north-western Indian Subcontinent (modern day Pakistan and India) around 2500–2000 BCE. Later, it became the northern province of the Achaemenid Empire. It was in these regions, where the fertile soil of the mountainous country is surrounded by the Turanian desert, that the prophet Zoroaster (Zarathushtra) was said to have been born and gained his first adherents. Avestan, the language of the oldest portions of the Zoroastrian &quot;Avesta&quot;, was one of the old Iranian languages, and is the oldest attested member of the Eastern Iranian branch of the Iranian language family.

It is suggested by E. Herzfeld that Bactria once belonged to the Median empire. It was annexed by the Achaemenid Persians in the 6th century BCE and together with Margiana it formed the twelfth satrapy of the Achaemenids. After Darius III of Persia was defeated by Alexander the Great and killed in the ensuing chaos, his murderer Bessus, the satrap of Bactria, tried to organize a national resistance based on his satrapie but was captured by other warlords and delivered to Alexander. He was then tortured and killed.

Alexander the Great conquered Sogdiana and Persia. However, in the south, beyond the Oxus, he met strong resistance. After two years of war Bactria was occupied by the Macedonians, but Alexander never successfully subdued the people. After Alexander&#x27;s death, the Macedonian Empire was eventually divided up between several generals in Alexander&#x27;s army. Bactria became part of Seleucus I, the founder of the Seleucid Empire.

&quot;The famed Bactrian Empire of a thousand cities, wallowing in wealth (opulentissimum illud mille urbium Bactrianum imperium)&quot;

The many difficulties against which the Seleucid kings had to fight and the attacks of Ptolemy II of Egypt gave Diodotus, satrap of Bactria, the opportunity to declare independence (about 255 BCE) and conquer Sogdiana. He was the founder of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. Diodotus and his successors were able to maintain themselves against the attacks of the Seleucids—particularly from Antiochus III the Great, who was ultimately defeated by the Romans (190 BCE).

The Greco-Bactrians were so powerful that they were able to expand their territory as far as India:
:&quot;As for Bactria, a part of it lies alongside Aria towards the north, though most of it lies above Aria and to the east of it. And much of it produces everything except oil. The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Bactria and beyond, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander...&quot;

The Greco-Bactrians used Greek language for administrative purposes, and the local Bactrian language was also Hellenized, as suggested by its adoption of the Greek alphabet and Greek loanwords. In turn, some of these words were also borrowed by modern Pashto, the language of Afghanistan.
The weakness of the Greco-Bactrians was shown by its sudden and complete overthrow, first by the Sakas, and then by the Yuezhi (who later became known as Kushans), who had conquered Bactria by the time of the visit of the Chinese envoy Zhang Qian (circa 127 BCE), who had been sent by the Han emperor to investigate lands to the west of China.

Under the Sassanids the province would become part of the area known as Khorasan.

&quot;Kujula Kadphises&quot;, the Guishuang &quot;xihou&quot; (or prince) of the Da Yuezhi, united the region in the early 1st century and laid the foundations for the powerful, but short-lived, Kushan Empire (1st to 3rd century CE), which was then overcome by the Sassanians from Persia. The name Daxia appears in Chinese from the 3rd century BCE to designate a mythical kingdom to the West, possibly a consequence of the first contacts with the expansion of the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and then is used by the explorer Zhang Qian in 126 BCE to designate Bactria.
The reports of Zhang Qian were put in writing in the &quot;Shiji&quot; (&quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;) by Sima Qian in the 1st century BCE. They describe an important urban civilization of about one million people, living in walled cities under small city kings or magistrates. Daxia was an affluent country with rich markets, trading in an incredible variety of objects, coming as far as Southern China. By the time Zhang Qian visited Daxia, there was no longer a major king, and the Bactrian were suzerains to the nomadic Yuezhi, who were settled to the north of their territory beyond the Oxus (Amu Darya). Overall Zhang Qian depicted a rather sophisticated but demoralized people who were afraid of war.

Following these reports, the Chinese Emperor Wu Di was informed of the level of sophistication of the urban civilizations of Ferghana, Bactria and Parthia, and became interested in developing commercial relationship with them:

:&quot;The Son of Heaven on hearing all this reasoned thus: Ferghana (Dayuan) and the possessions of Bactria (Daxia) and Parthia (Anxi) are large countries, full of rare things, with a population living in fixed abodes and given to occupations somewhat identical with those of the Chinese people, but with weak armies, and placing great value on the rich produce of China&quot; (Hanshu, Former Han History).

These contacts immediately led to the dispatch of multiple embassies from the Chinese, which helped to develop the Silk Road.

===Modern history===

 clashes between Taliban and guerrilla bands have been reported in the province

On 9 March 2023, Daud Muzamil, the Taliban governor of Afghanistan&#x27;s Balkh province was killed in a blast at his office.

==Economy==

Like in other parts of Afghanistan, agriculture plays an important part of Balkh&#x27;s economy. It is known for producing some of the sweetest melons and grapes. It is expected that the province will witness a major agriculture boost in the near future after the Qush Tepa Canal is completed, which &quot;will irrigate 500,000 hectares of land in Balkh, Jawzjan and Faryab provinces.&quot; This will significantly increase Balkh&#x27;s economy and population as many Afghans from other parts of the country will move to the province for employment purposes.

===Mining===
On October 5, 2018, in Washington, D.C., Afghan officials signed a 30-year contract involving a $56 million investment by investment group Centar and its operating company Afghan Gold and Minerals Co. for exploration of an area covering 500 square km for copper, with development of mining due to begin thereafter.

<text>Bamyan, also spelled Bamiyan, Bāmīān or Bāmyān (), is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan with the city of Bamyan as its center, located in central parts of Afghanistan.

The terrain in Bamyan is mountainous or semi-mountainous, at the western end of the Hindu Kush mountains concurrent with the Himalayas. The province is divided into eight districts, with the town of Bamyan serving as its capital. The province has a population of about 495,557 and borders Samangan to the north, Baghlan, Parwan, and Maidan Wardak to the east, Ghazni and Daikundi to the south, and Ghor and Sar-e-Pol to the west. It is the largest province in the Central region of Afghanistan. 

It was a center of commerce and Buddhism in the 4th and 5th centuries. In antiquity, central Afghanistan was strategically placed to thrive from the Silk Road caravans that crisscrossed the region, trading between the Roman Empire, Han dynasty, Central Asia, and South Asia. Bamyan was a stopping-off point for many travelers. It was here that elements of Greek and Buddhist art were combined into a unique classical style known as Greco-Buddhist art.

The province has several famous historical sites, including the now-destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan, around which are more than 3,000 caves, the Band-e-Amir National Park, Dara-e-Ajhdar, Gholghola, and Zuhak ancient towns, the Feroz Bahar, Astopa, Klegan, Gaohargin, Kaferan, and Cheldukhtaran.

== History ==
=== Ancient ===
Archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BC, and the early city of Mundigak (near Kandahar in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby Indus Valley civilization.

After 2000 BC, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many Indo-European-speaking Indo-Iranians. These tribes later migrated further south to India, west to what is now Iran, and towards Europe via the area north of the Caspian Sea. The region as a whole was called Ariana.

The people shared similar culture with other Indo-Iranians. The ancient religion of Kafiristan survived here until the 19th century. Another religion, Zoroastrianism is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BC, as its founder Zoroaster is thought to have lived and died in Balkh. Ancient Eastern Iranian languages may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism.

By the middle of the 6th century BC, the Achaemenid Persians overthrew the Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and Bactria within its eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of King Darius I of Persia mentions the Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.

In 330 BC, Alexander the Great seized the area but left it to the Seleucids to rule.

Afghanistan&#x27;s significant ancient tangible and intangible Buddhist heritage is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds, including religious and artistic remnants. Buddhist doctrines are reported to have reached as far as Balkh even during the life of the Buddha (563 BC to 483 BC), as recorded by Husang Tsang. It became the site of an early Buddhist monastery. Buddhism was by this time in &quot;an expansionist mode, offering religious practices that spoke to the masses and an appealing style of illustrative art, backed by the subtle philosophy of the Mahayana sect&quot;. Many statues of Buddha were carved into the sides of cliffs facing Bamyan city. The two most prominent of these statues were standing Buddhas, now known as the Buddhas of Bamyan, measuring 53 and 40 meters high respectively, which were the largest examples of standing Buddha carvings in the world. They were probably erected in the 4th or 5th century A.D. They were cultural landmarks for many years and are listed among UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Sites.

===Medieval===
By the 7th century, when the Arabs first arrived, it was under the control of the Turk Shahis before being conquered in the name of Islam by the Saffarids in the 9th century. The Tang dynasty of China controlled large parts of the region during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang and Emperor Gaozong of Tang. The Tibetan Empire also extended its influence into the region. The region fell to the Ghaznavids followed by the Ghurids before the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. After the Mongol invasion, the area was ruled by Arghun Khan of Ilkhanate, later by the Timurids and Mughals.

In 1709, when the Hotaki dynasty rose to power in Kandahar and defeated the Persian Safavids, Bamyan was under the Mughal Empire influence until Ahmad Shah Durrani made it become part of the Afghan Durrani Empire, which became what is now the modern state of Afghanistan.

=== 20th century ===
In the 1980s, during the Soviet-Afghan War, the Hazara rebel leader Abdul Ali Mazari began a resistance movement against the Soviets in the region, Shura-e-Itifaq-e-Islami. In the early 1990s, there was an agreement to run Bamyan under a council of &quot;local ethnic and political groups&quot;.

Later in the 1990s, the Taliban took control of the region and made their own government; one notable figure of this group was Mohammed Akbari, who effectively worked with the Taliban after meeting with one of their delegations in 1998 (and would later serve as an Afghan Parliament member in the 2000s). Some Hazaras allied with them. Bamyan was the main location for a rebellion against the Taliban, an alliance of armed Shiite groups named the Hizb-e Wahdat. This led to a struggle in the western province of Bamyan, Yakawlang, which was regarded by both sides as being key to control northern and central Afghanistan.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====
In 2000, the Taliban lost control of the district to local militias, but quickly took it back. To curb future rebellions, in early 2001 the Taliban arrested 300 civilian adult men and executed them publicly. The Supreme Leader of the Taliban at the time, Mullah Mohammad Omar, allegedly stopped more retribution acts in the area, but he did not forgive the rebellion. In March, Omar ordered the Taliban to destroy the Buddhas of Bamiyan, claiming they were symbols of idolatry. UNESCO called it a &quot;crime against culture&quot;.

Later in 2001, the U.S. and NATO invaded Afghanistan, and local militias in Bamyan sided with them to fight against the Taliban. There was evidence that Taliban fighters started massacring many Hazaras there in October. The Taliban fled the region in December. NATO eventually created a new government in Afghanistan. In 2003, Bamyan was recognized as one of the safest provinces in the country, which allowed for civil rebuilding. Over the next few decades, women&#x27;s rights would be restored. It became the area of the country most visited by tourists, and it elected Afghanistan&#x27;s first female governor of a province, Habiba Sarabi, who created the Band-e-Amir National Park. A local Hazara named Haji Hekmat Hussein, a parliamentary candidate in the U.S.&#x27; new government, was secretly a Taliban intelligence officer who participated in the 2001 massacre. He would be arrested and jailed, but was released in 2020 as a part of the Doha Agreement between the U.S. and Taliban.

A small number of troops from New Zealand would be stationed there, and the Taliban insurgency started targeting them in 2008. The U.S. made a &quot;protective belt&quot; around the province that stopped anyone outside, including other Afghanis, from coming into Bamyan. Control of the belt was given to local militias, which caused conflict between various ethnic groups. By 2009, the regional Afghan National Police, who fought against insurgents, started running out of money, and had to be aided by U.S. and New Zealand troops.

==== 2010s and 2020s ====
By 2011, the Taliban in Bamyan started gaining strength, and there was concern over their future plans as NATO began their phased withdrawal from the country. The U.S. and NATO&#x27;s combat mission in Afghanistan formally ended in 2014.

In 2021, the Taliban started an offensive to retake Afghanistan. They made significant advances by July, and two districts, Saighan and Kahmard, had been taken. There was an effort by police and local militias to keep the Taliban 60 miles away from Bamyan city, which the Afghanistan government believed could be the start of a turnaround for their military in the region. In August 2021, Ashraf Ghani&#x27;s government collapsed, and the Taliban took Bamyan on August 15. Initially, there was a conflict between different Taliban members in the area of whether or not policies put in place in the province to show the new Taliban government would be more liberal or moderate in its ideology. Other Taliban members resented the locals who embraced those ideals in the prior 20 years. In July 2022, the Taliban forbid humanitarian aid into the province. In August 2023, they banned women from entering Band-e-Amir National Park.

== Transportation ==

As of May 2014, the province was served by Bamyan Airport in Bamyan which had regularly scheduled direct flights to Kabul.

== Economy ==


=== Agriculture ===
Bamiyan has been particularly famous for its potatoes. The region is also known for a &quot;shuttle system&quot; of planting, wherein seed potatoes are grown in winter in Jalalabad, a warm area of eastern Afghanistan, and then transferred to Bamyan for spring re-planting.

=== Tourism ===
Prior to the Soviet invasion of 1979, the province attracted many tourists. Although this number is considerably fewer now, Bamyan is the first province in Afghanistan to have set up a tourist board, Bamyan Tourism. A feature of this developing tourist industry is based on skiing. The province is said to have &#x27;some of the best &quot;outback skiing&quot; in the world and in 2008 an $1.2 million project to encourage skiing was launched by the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) with the help of NZAID, New Zealand government&#x27;s international aid agency. The province hosts the Afghan Ski Challenge, a 7 km downhill race over ungroomed and powdered snow, founded by Swiss journalist and skier Christoph Zurcher. Tissot, the Swiss watch manufacturer, is the principal sponsor.

== Education ==

Bamyan Province is home to the region&#x27;s only university, Bamiyan University in the city of Bamyan. The school was founded in the mid-1990s, and largely destroyed under the Taliban and by US airstrikes. It was later refurbished by New Zealand Provincial Reconstruction Teams following the fall of the Taliban.

== Demographics ==

As of 2020, the total population of Bamyan province is around 495,557.

<text>Farah (Persian/) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the southwestern part of the country on the border with Iran. It is a spacious and sparsely populated province, divided into eleven districts and contains hundreds of villages. It has a population of about 563,026, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a rural tribal society. The Farah Airport is located near the city of Farah, which serves as the capital of the province. Farah is linked with Iran via the Iranian border town of Mahirud. The famous tourism sites of the province include Pul Garden, New Garden, Kafee Garden, shrine of Sultan Amir and Kafer castle.

Geographically the province is approximately , roughly twice the size of Maryland, or half the size of South Korea. The province is bounded on the north by Herat, on the northeast by Ghor, the southeast by Helmand, the south by Nimroz, and on the west by Iran. It is the fourth largest province in Afghanistan by area, but the second least densely populated province.

==History==

Shahr-e Kohne (&quot;Old City&quot;) or Fereydun Shahr (&quot;City of Fereydoon&quot;) is located in Farah city. This ancient city is more than 3000 years old. It was one of the ancient places of the Persian kings, as Farah belonged historically to the Iranian empires. The name &quot;Fereydun&quot; here refers to a hero of the Persian epic Shahnameh.

The territory was known around 500 BC as Drangiana, with Arachosia being to the east and Ariana to the north. It was part of the Median Empire followed by the Achaemenids. In 330 BC Alexander the Great took possession of the land and made it part of his empire. Upon Alexander&#x27;s untimely death in 323 BC the region, along with the rest of his vast empire, was fought over by his generals all vying to be his successor. Eventually several of these were successful in carving out parts of Alexander&#x27;s empire for themselves thereby becoming his official successors or Diadochi. One of these generals, Seleucus, made this region part of his domain giving it his name as the Seleucid Empire. They were replaced by other rulers and the area eventually fell to the Sassanids, then to the Arab Muslims. The Saffarids rose to power in 867 AD in Zaranj and made Farah part of their empire. By the 10th century the province became part of the Ghaznavid Empire, whose capital was located in Ghazni. They were replaced by the Ghurids and then after a century later the area saw the Mongol invasion.

The province was taken by Timur and eventually fell to the Safavid dynasty. It had been lost by the Safavids to the Uzbeks of Transoxiana, but was regained following a Safavid counter-offensive around 1600 CE, along with Herat and Sabzavar. In 1709, the Afghans gained independence from the Safavids and Farah became part of the Hotaki Empire. By 1747, it became part of Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s last Afghan empire. During the 19th century, the British army passed through the province to support Afghan forces in Herat Province against the invading Persians.

Following the Marxist revolution in 1978, Farah was one of the cities in which civilian massacres were carried out by the now-dominant Khalqi communists against their political, ethnic, and religious opponents. At the start of the 1980s, the majority of Farah was allied with the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami movement, but after 1981 the province split along linguistic lines, with Pashto-speaking opponents of the communist government remaining with Harakat, Group-e-Malema (Teacher Group) and Tajiks moving to the Jamiat-e Islami.

Following the 1992 collapse of the communist-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, Farah Province, unlike many other provinces was relatively peaceful. Most of the Farah Mujahideen belonged to Harakat Islami of Malavi Khalas, Group-e-Malema (Teacher Group), Hizb-e-Islami and Jamiat Islami.

A 1995 Oxfam report lists Farah as &quot;severely mined&quot;, and indicated that Farah was particularly problematic due to the wide variety of mine devices employed there, as well as usage of mines to deny access to irrigation systems. By late 1995, the stalemate broke as the Taliban counterattacked after Ismail Khan&#x27;s failed drive to Kandahar, and all of Farah fell as the Taliban swept to take Herat on 5 September 1995.

===Recent history up to 2009===


Due to its isolation from the Taliban&#x27;s area of focus, Farah exerted some small level of local control during Taliban rule. By the end of the Taliban period, there were eight United Nations Development Program (UNDP) schools, for both boys and girls, recognized and supported by the Taliban in Kandahar and Farah. UNDP noted that the local authorities in Farah were &quot;particularly cooperative&quot; on the subject.

Following the Coalition entry and union with the Northern Alliance after September 11, 2001, the Taliban withdrew from Farah due to the heavy Coalition aerial campaign, though ground troops were not sent to the province until some time later.

Farah witnessed heavy clashes after the US backed overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, and is being considered insecure, relative to many parts of the country. Although there was sporadic heavy combat in the Bala Baluk, Bakwa, Khak-e-Safid, Pusht-e-Road and Gulestan districts. Due to its proximity to the restive Helmand and Uruzgan provinces, Farah experienced problems with roaming insurgent gangs moving through the province and occupying parts of the province for brief periods of time. Incidents of this type have increased as Taliban fighters face heavy pressure from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) offensives in the south.

The roads in Farah province have seen massive improvement since May 2005 and are still being improved to date April 2006. The education system greatly improved and a large number of illegal weapons were collected and destroyed in the province as testimony to the Provincial Reconstruction Team. The United States built a base at Farah Airport, which is being expanded and also houses the Afghan National Security Forces (ANFS).

In May 2009, an American airstrike in the village of Granai in Bala Buluk District occurred that killed a large number of civilians. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the villagers said that 147 were killed, an independent Afghan human rights group put the number of killed at 117. The Americans claimed the airstrike was targeting Taliban militants, but villagers said that the Taliban had left by the time the airstrike occurred. On May 19, the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry visited Farah town to talk with the survivors. He promised that &quot;the United States will work tirelessly with your government, army and police to find ways to reduce the price paid by civilians, and avoid tragedies like what occurred in Bala Baluk.&quot;

==Demographics==

As of 2021, the total population of Farah province is about 573,146, which is predominately tribal and a rural society. In 2012, about 482,400 are settled while the remaining are the Kuchi and other nomads. Majority of the province is populated by Pashtuns, followed by Farsiwans and some Baluch are also present. The nomads and many other villagers are Pashtun tribes of the Alizai, Barakzai, and Nurzai. However, the Kochi nomads make a sizable population amongst the Pashtuns in winter. An ethnic census has never been conducted in Afghanistan but according to some recent estimates 80% of the Farah province are Pashtuns and 14% [Tajiks]. Farah city however has Tajiks majority

<doc id="457225" wikidata="Q173830" url="?curid=457225" title="Faryab Province">
<text>Faryab (Dari,Pashto : فاریاب) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, which is located in the north of the country bordering neighboring Turkmenistan. It has a population of about 1,109,223, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a tribal society. The province encompasses 15 districts and over 1,000 villages. The capital of Faryab province is Maymana. It also borders Jowzjan Province, Sar-e Pol Province, Ghor Province and Badghis Province.

==History==

Faryab is a Persian toponym meaning &quot;lands irrigated by diversion of river water&quot;. The name Faryab takes its name from a town founded in the area by the Sassanids. It is the home town of the famed Islamic philosopher, al-Farabi (per the biographer Ibn al-Nadim). The area is part of the trans-border region of Greater Khorasan; during the colonial era, British geographers referred to the area as Afghan Turkestan.

The history of settlement in Faryab is ancient and comprises layer upon layer of occupation. At times, it was a melting pot within which a host of cultures have merged into a non-conflictual whole or at least peaceable coexistence.

Maymana and Andkhoy (Andkhui) entered written history 2,500 years ago when Jews arrived and settled in 586 BC, fleeing the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar. The territory was under Persian control at the time, which later gave way to Greek rule following the conquest by Alexander the Great in 326 BC.

Persian dominance was restored from the 3rd to the 7th century AD.

The pre-Islamic period ended with the conquest of northern Afghanistan by Arab Muslims (651-661 AD). The area &quot;turned into a vast battlefield as the two great Arab and Persian cultures battled for not only political and geographical supremacy but ideological supremacy.&quot; As a result, centuries of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity and indigenous pagan cults were swept away. Various Islamic dynasties rose to power and influenced the locals. They included the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Seljuks, and Ghurids.

The history of Faryab was greatly altered yet again in the 11th century, this time with the invasion of the Mongols, under Genghis Khan and his descendants. As they moved into the area from the north, cities and towns including Maymana were razed, populations massacred, grain, fields and livestock stolen or burnt and ancient irrigation systems obliterated. Faryab was itself destroyed by the Mongols in 1220. Control by the Mongols stemmed from the alternating capitals of Bukhara or Samarkand north of the Amu Darya River. They ruled in a decentralized manner, however, allowing local tribal chiefs in Maymana and elsewhere considerable autonomy (a legacy which was to last until the end of the 19th century).
In 1500, Uzbek princes, in the form of the Khanate of Bukhara (a Turco-Mongol state), swept across the Amu Darya, reaching Faryab and related areas around 1505. They joined a substantial and largely pastoral Arab population and ruled the area until the mid-18th century.

It was conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1748 and became part of the Durrani Empire. The area was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan wars that were fought in the 19th and 20th centuries. Faryab become a province in 1964. From the administrative reforms of the 1930s until then it was known as Maymana and was a sub-province of Balkh Province, which had its headquarters in Mazar-i-Sharif.

During the 1990s Afghan Civil War (early 90s and late 90s), the front line between Taliban and opposition forces often fell between Badghis and Faryab provinces in the mid-1990s. Ismail Khan also fled to Faryab to reconstitute his forces following the Taliban takeover of Herat Province, but was betrayed by Abdul Malik Pahlawan.

In May 1997, Abdul Malik Pahlawan raised the Taliban flag over the capital of Maymana, switching sides and initiating a renewed Taliban offensive from the west. Following a series of changing allegiances and falling out with Malik, the Taliban withdrew from the area, but in 1998 a contingent of 8,000 Taliban fighters pressed through Faryab, seizing Abdul Rashid Dostum&#x27;s headquarters in Sheberghan, in neighboring Jowzjan province.

Faryab province has been one of the more peaceful areas in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban government in late 2001. Recent development projects in the province have focused on expanding the agricultural potential of the province, in particular the re-forestation of areas of the province that were denuded in the recent past.
It was reported in 2006 that Abdul Malik Pahlawan&#x27;s Freedom Party of Afghanistan still maintained an armed militant wing, which was contributing to instability in province. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANFS) began expanding and slowly took over control. The Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border is maintained by the Afghan Border Police (ABP) while law and order for the rest of the province is provided by the NATO-trained Afghan National Police (ANP).
Between 2006 and late 2014, the province had a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), which was led by Norway. The Norwegian PRT had its base at Maymana and had also been given the responsibility for the Ghormach District.

Afghanistan signed a deal with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of oil blocks in the Amu Darya basin, a project expected to earn billions of dollars over two decades; the deal covers drilling and a refinery in the northern provinces of Sar-e Pol and Faryab, and is the first international oil production agreement entered into by the Afghan government for several decades. CNPC began Afghan oil production in October 2012, and in the same month a huge gas reserves were discovered in the Andkhoy District of Faryab province.

In July 2016, Human Rights Watch accused Abdul Rashid Dostum&#x27;s National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan of killing, abusing and looting civilians in Faryab.

As of January 2022, clashes have been reported in the province between the Taliban and resistance fighters, including in the provincial capital Maimana.

==Transport infrastructure==

As of May 2014 Maymana Airport was served by regular passenger service to Herat.

The province&#x27;s road infrastructure was described in 2006 as &quot;completely in shambles&quot; without even a single paved road.

There exists a short international railway connection between Andkhoy and Aqina, which then connects to the Turkmen rail network at Atamyrat.

==Economy==
Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary economic activities in the province however Faryab is renowned for its carpets, knitted as well as woven Kilims, which are traditionally a female-dominated handicraft. The province has a disputed amount of natural gas reserves but levels of exploitation are low.

There is a salt mine in Dowlat Abad district and some marble resources (said to owned by Abdul Rashid Dostum) and there are also pistachio forests which produce &quot;Pistacia vera&quot; which are renowned for their color and intense flavor.

<text>Ghazni (; ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in southeastern Afghanistan. The province contains 19 districts, encompassing over a thousand villages and roughly 1.3 million people, making it the 5th most populous province. The city of Ghazni serves as the capital. It lies on the important Kabul–Kandahar Highway, and has historically functioned as an important trade center. The Ghazni Airport is located next to the city of Ghazni and provides limited domestic flights to Afghanistan&#x27;s capital, Kabul.

Ghazni borders the provinces of Maidan Wardak, Logar, Paktia, Paktika, Zabul, Uruzgan, Daykundi and Bamyan.

== Etymology ==
The province was known as Ghazna in the 10th century, during and after the Ghaznavid era.

== History ==
Ghazni was a thriving Buddhist center before and during the 7th century AD. Excavations have revealed religious artifacts of both Hindu and Buddhist traditions.


In 644 AD, the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited the city of Jaguda (probably Ghazni), while returning from Varnu (modern Bannu, Pakistan)

=== Islamization ===

In 683 AD, armies from the Umayyad Caliphate brought Islam to the area and attempted to conquer the capital of Ghazni but the local tribes fiercely resisted. Its resistance was so famed that Yaqub Saffari (840-879) from Zaranj made an example of Ghazni when he ranged the vast region conquering in the name of Islam. The city was completely destroyed by the Saffarids in 869. A substantial portion of the local population including Hindus and Buddhists were converted to Islam by Mahmud of Ghazni


After the rebuilding of the city by Yaqub&#x27;s brother, it became the dazzling capital of the Ghaznavids from 994 to 1160, encompassing much of North India, Persia and Central Asia. Many iconoclastic campaigns were launched from Ghazni into India. The Ghaznavids took Islam to India and returned with fabulous riches taken from both prince and temple god. Contemporary visitors and residents at Ghazni write with wonder of the ornateness of the buildings, the great libraries, the sumptuousness of the court ceremonies and of the wealth of precious objects owned by Ghazni&#x27;s citizens.

Ferishta records attacks by Muhammad of Ghor: &quot;at the same time most of the infidels who inhabited the mountains between Ghazni and the Indus were also converted, some by force and others by persuasion.&quot; Ghazni&#x27;s eponymous capital was razed in 1151 by the Ghorid Alauddin. It again flourished but only to be permanently devastated, this time in 1221 by Genghis Khan and his Mongol armies after 6 years of Khwarezmid rule. Ghazni&#x27;s strategic position, both economically and militarily, assured its revival initially under the Qarlughids, albeit without its dazzling former grandeur.

Ghazni is famous for its minarets built on a stellar plan. They date from the middle of the twelfth century and are the surviving element of the mosque of Bahramshah. Their sides are decorated with geometric patterns. Upper sections of the minarets have been damaged or destroyed. The most important mausoleum located in Ghazni is that of Sultan Mahmud&#x27;s. Others include the tombs of poets and scientists, for example Al-Biruni and Sanai. The only ruins in Old Ghazni retaining a semblance of architectural form are two towers, about 43 m (140 ft) high and some 365 m (1,200 ft) apart. According to inscriptions, the towers were constructed by Mahmud of Ghazni and his son.

Ibn Battuta noted &quot;The greater part of the town is in ruins, with nothing but a fraction of it still standing, although it was formerly a great city.&quot;

Babur records in his memoirs that Ghazni was part of Zabulistan. The area was controlled by the Mughals until Nader Shah and his Persian forces invaded it in 1738. Ahmad Shah Durrani conquered Ghazni in 1747 and made it part of the Durrani Empire. During the First Anglo-Afghan War, the capital of Ghazni province was destroyed by the British-led Indian forces in the Battle of Ghazni.

In the 1960s a 15-meter female Buddha was discovered lying on its back and surrounded by empty pillars that once held rows of smaller male Buddhas. Parts of the female Buddha have been stolen. In the 1980s a mud brick shelter was created to protect the sculpture, but the wood supports were stolen for firewood and the shelter partially collapsed.

=== Recent history ===
Since the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, there has been a Provincial reconstruction base and a NATO forces base. These western forces (mostly Polish Armed Forces) were hunting Taliban and al-Qaida militants, who were active in the area.

Like many southern Afghan provinces, Ghazni has a precarious security situation. The Taliban insurgents are found in the rural areas outside of the capital, and are involved in attacks on provincial schools and government infrastructure. The province has avoided the outright warfare seen in other provinces of Afghanistan such as Helmand and Kandahar, but that is due more to political expediency and the tactical plans of the NATO-led ISAF force than the existence of a stable security situation in the province. Ex-Governor Taj Mohammad was killed by insurgents in 2006 after being appointed police chief of the province with a mandate to quell the power of the Taliban. On the same day there was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the governor at the time, Sher Alam Ibrahimi. There is a Polish and American Provincial Reconstruction Team base located in Ghazni.

* In late April 2007, news agencies reported that Taliban fighters had taken control of Giro District in the province. The Taliban reportedly killed the district administrator, chief of police (who had been on the job for only one month) and three police officers. The Taliban withdrew from the district center one day later.
* In July 2007, 23 South Korean volunteers were kidnapped in the province by the Taliban.
* On September 28, 2010, the Deputy Governor of Ghazni and five others were killed after a suicide bomber on a motorized rickshaw attacked their vehicle. Deputy Governor Mohammad Kazim Allahyar and several men travelling with him were killed instantly when the attacker detonated his explosives at the back of their car near the airport in Ghazni City. The bodies were so badly burnt that there was some confusion about the identity of the other victims. Provincial police chief Delawar Zahid reported Allahyar&#x27;s son, nephew and driver died, along with two civilians passing by on a bicycle.
* As of 26 September 2014, there is ongoing fighting in key districts between the Taliban and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF).
* After steady gains by the Taliban across the province in 2017 and early 2018 the Battle of Ghazni took place in August, 2018.

== Districts ==

== Healthcare ==


The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 35% in 2005 to 18% in 2011. 
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 7% in 2005 to 11% in 2011.

== Education ==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 35% in 2005 to 31% in 2011.
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 39% in 2005 to 54% in 2011.

== Demographics ==
As of 2020, the total population of the province is about 1,386,764, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a tribal society. Ethnically, Ghazni is composed mainly of Hazaras and Pashtuns, which both make up about 45% of the population each. Hazaras live mainly in the north and west, while the Pashtuns live mainly in the south and east. Tajiks make up only about 5% of the whole province&#x27;s population, but are the main ethnic group of the capital city Ghazni at about 50% there. Also, there is a small community of Hindus. Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary occupation of the citizens of Ghazni. Wheat, alfalfa, melons, and almonds are among the largest crops produced.

== Infrastructure ==

The Sardeh Band Dam is located in Andar District near the border with Paktika Province. It creates a large water reservoir that is critical to the irrigation of the Kahnjoor farming zone. The dam itself and the canal system it feeds both need repairs and maintenance.

Governor Musa Khan Akbarzada stated that key development projects would be launched in southern Ghazni in 2012 ahead of the Asian capital of the Islamic civilization for 2013. The projects include the construction of a proposed Islamic cultural center, a mosque, a covered bazaar, a gymnasium, a guesthouse, an airport, a five-star hotel and two 27 story-buildings and others. More than 2,000 people would find work opportunities on the $30 million projects; $10 million would be provided by the central government, $7 million by the Polish provincial reconstruction team (PRT) and $3 million by the US. A 40-kilometer road would be asphalted by the end of 2012.

Ghazni province is to be connected to the national electrical distribution system via North-east Power System (NEPS). The construction of the transmission line would begin from east Chimtala to Ghazni using a high voltage transmission network (2 x 220kV transmission lines and power substations). The project is to be implemented by USFOR-A and USAID costing $101 million. However, the Asian Development Bank agreed to complete the transmission line from Chimtala to Dast-i-Barchi; hence reducing the Project scope to begin from Dast-i-Barchi instead of Chimtala. The implementation of this project was delayed due to USACE being unable to award a contract because bids received for the project were more than double the estimated costs, due largely to security concerns resulting from the risks associated with implementing firm-fixed-price contracts in a kinetic environment, poor cost estimates, and unrealistic periods of performance. USACE is re-procuring both projects and plans to award contracts in June or July 2012, which will delay the project&#x27;s execution schedules between 6 and 15 months. Furthermore, the delays in transferring funds contributed to delays in project execution. This line is a key part of a planned NEPS to SEPS connection to transport power to Kandahar to replace the expensive diesel-fueled power plants.

=== Transportation ===

The Kabul–Kandahar Highway runs through the province.

The Ghazni Airport began operations in April 2012 but does not have any commercial flights as of August 2018. Residents in neighboring provinces, such as Logar, Paktika, Maidan Shahr and Zabul, would also benefit from the airport.

== Natural resources ==

Recent geologic surveys have indicated Ghazni may have one of the world&#x27;s richest deposits of lithium. Gold and copper were also found in the Zarkashan Mine of Ghazni province with an estimated value of US$30 billion. Whilst lithium deposits valued at around US$60 billion, were discovered in four eastern and western provinces of Afghanistan, together with other newly (2010) discovered mineral deposits, the total value estimate of US$3 trillion is based on a survey of 30 percent of the country&#x27;s land mass.

<doc id="457231" wikidata="Q186392" url="?curid=457231" title="Ghor Province">
<text>Ghōr, also spelled Ghowr or Ghur (), is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan. It is located in the western Hindu Kush in central Afghanistan, towards the northwest. The province contains eleven districts, encompassing hundreds of villages, and approximately 764,472 settled people. Firuzkoh (known as “Chaghcharan” until 2014) is the capital of the province.

==Etymology==
The ancient Indo-European, Sogdian &quot;gor-&quot;/&quot;gur-&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;-) is well preserved in all Slavic &quot;gor-&quot;/&quot;gór- (goor-/gur-)&quot;, e.g.: Gorals, Goran, Goranci, Góra, Gora..., in Iranian languages, e.g.: Gorani language, Guran (Kurdish tribe). The Polish notation using &quot;gór-&quot; (&quot;ó&quot; stands for a sound between English &quot;oo&quot; and &quot;u&quot;) instead of the popular &quot;gur-&quot; or &quot;ghur-&quot; preserves the ancient orthography.

==History==


The inhabitants of Ghor were completely Islamized during the Ghurids era. Before the 12th century, the area was home to Buddhists, Zoroastrians, Hindus and a small number of Jews. Remains of the oldest settlements discovered by Lithuanian archaeologists in 2007 and 2008 in Ghor date back to 5000 BC. Ruins of a few castles and other defense fortifications were also discovered in the environs of Chaghcharan. A Buddhist monastery hand-carved on the bluff of the river Harirud existed in the first centuries during the prevalence of Buddhism. The artificial caves revealed testimony of the daily life of the Buddhist monks.

Various scholars and historians such as John McLeod attribute the conversion of the Ghauris to Islam to Mahmud Ghazni after his conquest of Ghor.

Traditional Muslim historians such as Estakhri and Ibn Haukal attest to the existence of the non-Islamic enclave of Ghor before the time of Ghazni, which is attributed to converting its population to Islam.

Minhaju-S-Siraj recorded strife between the non-Muslim and Muslim populations:

According to Minhahu-S Siraj, Amir Suri was captured by Mahmud of Ghazni, made prisoner along with his son, and taken to Ghazni, where Amir Suri died.

In 1011, 1015 and 1020, both Mahmud and Mas&#x27;ud I led expeditions into Ghur and established Islam in place of indigenous paganism. After this, Ghur was considered a vassal state of the Ghaznavid empire. During the reign of &#x27;Abd ar Rashi and the usurper Toghrul, Ghur and Gharchistan gained autonomy.

Ghor was also the center of the Ghurid dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries. The remains of their capital Firozkoh, which was sacked and destroyed by the Mongols in 1222, includes the Minaret of Jam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Karzai and Ghani administrations===

In June 2004, hundreds of troops of Abdul Salaam Khan, who had rejected the Afghan government&#x27;s plan to disarm regional militias, attacked Chaghcharan and took over the city in an afternoon-long siege. Eighteen people were killed or wounded in the fighting, at which point Governor Mohammed Ibrahim fled. Three days later the Afghan government announced that it would not retake Chaghcharan. Khan and Ibrahim began negotiations soon after but reached no agreement. Khan&#x27;s troops left Chaghcharan on 23 June, a day ahead of when an Afghan National Army battalion, led by Lieutenant-General Aminullah Paktiyanai, arrived with the support of roughly 20 U.S. soldiers.

===Taliban administration (2021-present)===

In 2021, the Taliban regained control of Ghor after the 2021 Taliban offensive.

Fifty people were killed in floods in the Ghor province in May 2024.

==Transportation==

As of September 2014, Chaghcharan Airport, located at the provincial capital of Chaghcharan, had regularly scheduled flights to the provinces of Kabul and Herat.

As of 2013, roads in the province remained largely undeveloped, unpaved and often lacked bridges over rivers.

==Economy==

Agriculture and animal husbandry are the primary economic activities in Ghor Province. According to the United Nations, many young men were forced to leave the province to find work in Herat or Iran and a small percentage of the population were teachers, government officials, carpet weavers, carpenters and tailors. Over half of the population could not cover their basic needs with their level of income. Opium production had returned to the region following the Taliban&#x27;s departure as locals attempted to increase their incomes by farming a more economically lucrative crop.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 14% in 2005 to 9% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant fell from 9% in 2005 to 3% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 19% in 2005 to 25% in 2011. The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 28% in 2005 to 47% in 2011.

Ghor University that first established as Ghor Higher Education Institute and then promoted to Ghor University has around 500 students with a significant number of girls. There are also some Teacher Training Institutes in the Firuzkoh, Taywara and Lal districts. The number of high schools increased in last the 10 years and attendance in university entrance exams (Kankor) jumped from hundreds to thousands of students. Several agriculture and mechanical schools were also established. There is only one nursing school that trains young female high school graduates for midwifery and nursing that is part of the Ministry of Public Health and run by an NGO in association with Ghor provincial hospital.

==Demographics==

As of 2020, the total population of Ghor province is about 764,472.

==Geography==

Ghor occupies the end of the Hindu Kush mountains. Ghor is 2,500 meters above sea level and heavy snowfalls often block many of its rugged passes from November to April. It is also a drought-prone area in the summer.

===Districts===

==Sports==

Football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, taekwondo and karate are all official sports of the province. In July 2010, the Ghor Province cricket team was founded and represent the province in domestic tournaments.

<doc id="457235" wikidata="Q173821" url="?curid=457235" title="Helmand Province">
<text>Helmand (Pashto/Dari: ; ), also known as Hillmand, in ancient times, as Hermand and Hethumand, is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, in the south of the country. It is the largest province by area, covering area. The province contains 18 districts, encompassing over 1,000 villages, and roughly 1,446,230 settled people. Lashkargah serves as the provincial capital. Helmand was part of the &quot;Greater Kandahar&quot; region until made into a separate province by the Afghan government in the 20th century.

The Helmand River flows through the mainly desert region of the province, providing water used for irrigation. The Kajaki Dam, which is one of Afghanistan&#x27;s major reservoirs, is located in the Kajaki district. Helmand is believed to be one of the world&#x27;s largest opium producing regions, responsible for around 42% of the world&#x27;s total production. This is believed to be more than the whole of Myanmar, which is the second-largest producing nation after Afghanistan. The region also produces tobacco, sugar beets, cotton, sesame, wheat, mung beans, maize, nuts, sunflowers, onions, potato, tomato, cauliflower, peanut, apricot, grape, and melon. The province has a domestic airport (Bost Airport), in the city of Lashkargah that was heavily used by NATO-led forces. The former British Camp Bastion and the U.S. Camp Leatherneck is a short distance southwest of Lashkargah.

Throughout the 2001-2021 war in Afghanistan, Helmand was a hotbed of insurgent activities and was often considered at the time to be Afghanistan&#x27;s &quot;most dangerous&quot; province. The province also witnessed some of the heaviest fighting during the war, where at its peak hundreds of civilians were being killed monthly. Its suitable climate for the cultivation of limited range of crops also contributed greatly to the Taliban&#x27;s finances through illicit opium sales. Additionally, Helmand is considered to be one of Afghanistan&#x27;s most socially conservative areas.

==History==

===Helmand culture===
Helmand culture of western Afghanistan was a Bronze Age culture of the 3rd millennium BC. It is exemplified by such major sites as Shahr-i Sokhta, Mundigak, and Bampur.

The term &quot;Helmand civilization&quot; was proposed by M. Tosi. This civilization flourished between 2500 BC and 1900 BC and may have coincided with the great flourishing of the Indus Valley civilisation. This was also the final phase of Periods III and IV of Shahr-i Sokhta, and the last part of Mundigak Period IV.

According to Jarrige et al.,

There were also links between Shahr-i Sokhta I, II, and III periods, and Mundigak III and IV periods, and between the sites of Balochistan and the Indus valley at the end of the 4th millennium, as well as in the first half of the 3rd millennium BC.

The Jiroft culture is closely related to the Helmand culture. The Jiroft culture flourished in eastern Iran, and the Helmand culture in western Afghanistan at the same time. They may represent the same cultural area. The Mehrgarh culture, on the other hand, is far earlier.

===Achaemenid times===

Helmand was inhabited by ancient peoples and governed by the Medes before falling to the Achaemenids.

Later, the area was part of the ancient Arachosia polity, and a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Asia, which connects Southern, Central and Southwest Asia.

The Helmand river valley is mentioned by name in the Avesta (Fargard 1:13) as &quot;Haetumant&quot;, one of the early centers or origins of the Zoroastrian faith, in pre-Islamic Afghan history. However, owing to the presence of non-Zoroastrians even though Zoroastrians being dominant before the Islamization of Afghanistan – particularly Buddhist.

Some Vedic scholars (e.g. Kochhar 1999) also believe the Helmand river corresponds to the Sarasvati river mentioned in the &quot;Rig Veda&quot; as the homeland of the Aryan tribes before migrating into the Indian Subcontinent, ca. 1500 BC.

===Alexander the Great to modern times===
It was invaded in 330 BC by Alexander the Great and became part of the Seleucid Empire. Later, it came under the rule of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, who erected a pillar there with a bilingual inscription in Greek and Aramaic. The territory was referred to as part of Zabulistan and ruled by the sun-worshipping Zunbils before the Muslim Arabs arrived in the 7th century, who were led by Abdur Rahman bin Samara. It later fell to the Saffarids of Zaranj and saw the first Muslim rule. Mahmud of Ghazni made it part of the Ghaznavids in the 10th century, who were replaced by the Ghurids.
After the destructions caused by Genghis Khan and his Mongol army in the 13th century, the Timurids established rule and began rebuilding Afghan cities. From about 1383 until his death in 1407, it was governed by Pir Muhammad, a grandson of Timur. By the early 16th century, it fell to Babur. However, the area was often contested by the Shia Safavids and Sunni Mughals until the rise of Mir Wais Hotak in 1709. He defeated the Safavids and established the Hotaki dynasty. The Hotakis ruled it until 1738 when the Afsharids defeated Shah Hussain Hotaki at what is now Old Kandahar.

===Durrani era===
When Ahmad Shah Durrani came to power in 1747, after Nader Shah was assassinated, he began redistributing land grants that had been given by his predecessor. At that time, the area of what is now Helmand province was part of Kandahar Province (which continued until it was split off into the new Farah Province during the reign of Sher Ali Khan), and it was known as &quot;Pusht-e Rud&quot;, or &quot;across the river&quot;, reflecting how the region was viewed from Kandahar, which was Ahmad Shah&#x27;s capital. Pusht-e Rud traditionally consisted into four districts: Zamindawar, Now Zad, Pusht-e Rud proper, and Garmsir. Ahmad Shah&#x27;s land redistribution legitimized existing Alizai influence in Zamindawar, while the powerful Barakzai received Pusht-e Rud proper, and the district of Garmsir in the south was granted to the Noorzai to protect against Baluch raids. Now Zad was divided between the Noorzai and the Ishaqzai. This arrangement has survived, with a few exceptions, until the present day.

Then, as now, relatively few members of the Popolzai tribe (to which Ahmad Shah Durrani belonged) lived in Helmand. The Durrani monarchs were thus ambivalent towards the area&#x27;s tribes and didn&#x27;t favor any one tribe over the others. Rather, they treated the tribes according to their relative power. Thus, the powerful Barakzai tribe received a hereditary position as ministers to the crown, as well as some of the most valuable land in Helmand: the alluvial plains around present-day Malgir, Babaji, and Spin Masjid, as well as the strategically important Gereshk.

That changed in 1826, when Dost Mohammad Khan, himself a Barakzai, seized power. Dost Mohammad increased taxes on non-Barakzai tribes in Helmand, especially the Alizai of Zamindawar. When the Alizai didn&#x27;t pay taxes, a Barakzai punitive expedition was sent to Zamindawar, and in Alizai clan chiefs were executed. During this period, the Alizai began to view the Barakzai as enemies, creating the Alizai-Barakzai dynamic that still heavily influences Helmand politics.

At this time, the area around Garmsir was effectively independent, and ignored by the monarchy in Kabul.

===Anglo-Afghan Wars===

In 1839, the British deposed Dost Mohammad Khan in favor of the Popolzai Shah Shujah Durrani. In doing so, they hoped to limit Russian influence in Afghanistan. Hoping to secure the loyalty of Helmandi tribal leaders, Shah Shujah reinstated the titles they had previously enjoyed under Popolzai rule, and he also held off on taxing them until his position was stronger. However, he kept the Barakzai tax collectors in office, and they resumed collection in 1840. When a Barakzai tax collector was killed at Sarwan Qala that year, the British sent in troops to enforce collection, a political blunder leading to open rebellion by the Alizai. It is not known if the British were aware of the political ramifications of Shah Shujah&#x27;s decision to retain the Barakzai tax collectors, but they were completely bewildered by the ensuing rebellion, reflecting a clear lack of understanding of local dynamics on their part.

The leader of the rebellion was Aktur Khan, who had risen to prominence during this dispute. His invocations of Alizai honor and appeals to group identity had resulted in him attaining chieftainship of the Alizai. After some skirmishes, the British offered to remove the Barakzai tax collectors in return for the dispersal of Aktur Khan&#x27;s 1,300 followers. This soon broke down, and by May 1841, Aktur Khan led a force of 3,000 men to capture Gereshk. The British retook Gereshk at the beginning of June and then led punitive expeditions into Zamindawar, and eventually the rebellion was defeated and Aktur Khan fled to Herat.

British-backed Barakzai horsemen were sent to reinforce Gereshk in November 1841. The Alizai repeatedly tried to capture it, but the Barakzai were able to maintain control until August 1842 because the other Barakzai who lived there kept them well-supplied.

Dost Mohammad Khan was reinstalled for a second reign when the British withdrew from Afghanistan, but he ran into financial difficulties and sought a subsidy from the British in 1857. He distributed money from this subsidy unevenly among Helmandi tribes, favoring the Barakzai over the others, which upset the balance of power between the tribes. The subsidy also divided Afghanistan into British and Russian spheres of influence, with Gereshk and the Helmand river being on the border between them, increasing the area&#x27;s strategic importance. The subsidy ended in 1862 when Dost Mohammad died and a succession crisis broke out between his sons. Helmandis fought as mercenaries on the side of one of them, Sher Ali Khan, playing a role in his eventual victory. The deciding battle was fought at Gereshk in 1868.

Indebted to the Helmandi tribes for their contributions during the war, Sher Ali scaled back tax collection in the area and reduced the allowances to the Barakzai khans. Because of this, the Alizai did not rebel during his reign. Another key development for Helmand (Pusht-e Rud) during Sher Ali&#x27;s reign was that he moved its four traditional districts into the newly created Farah Province, moving it out of Kandahar&#x27;s sphere of influence and meaning that he could influence the Pusht-e Rud area without going through a relative in Kandahar.

In November 1878, the British invaded Afghanistan again. They occupied Gereshk until February 1879; an Alizai force of 1500 attacked them as they withdrew. Sher Ali died soon after, however, and the British wanted to again occupy Gereshk as a forward outpost against Sher Ali&#x27;s son Ayub Khan. Perhaps realizing that the presence of their troops garrisoning Helmandi forts upset locals, the British sent a proxy Barakzai force to occupy Gereshk.

Ayub Khan found ample support from Helmandis in his subsequent campaign against the British: three or four thousand Alizai tribesmen, led by a man named Abu Bakr, had joined his army by October, as did a smaller contingent of Noorzai. Doubting the Barakzai&#x27;s loyalty, the British sent some of their own troops to reinforce Gereshk in July 1880, led by George Burrows. The Barakzai promptly mutinied and went over to Ayub Khan&#x27;s side — a rare Barakzai-Alizai alliance, joining against a common enemy. The British withdrew and Ayub Khan&#x27;s army pursued, leading to a major Afghan victory at the Battle of Maiwand on 27 July. Having achieved their main goal of defeating the British, the Alizai then left and returned to Zamindawar.

The British later defeated Ayub Khan, but they ended up withdrawing from Afghanistan altogether, installing Abdur Rahman Khan as the new ruler and giving him a subsidy. Abdur Rahman Khan was a strong and intelligent state-builder who used the subsidy to finance a professional army. He defeated Abu Bakr of the Alizai and had him exiled, after which the Alizai cooperated with paying taxes. He used a combination of incentives and force to move the Ishaqzai and Noorzai to the northwestern part of Afghanistan, away from the lands along the Helmand they had been granted by Nader Shah. Their relocation was a disaster and many ended up returning to the Helmand area.

When they came back, however, they were only given scattered, less-productive lands. This dramatically changed the power dynamic of the Helmand area, marking the beginning of Ishaqzai and (to a lesser degree) Noorzai disenfranchisement from government that has continued into the 21st century. The Noorzai would occupy marginal lands until the late 20th century, and the Ishaqzai population remains dispersed and scattered throughout Helmand today.

The weakening of Helmand&#x27;s non-Barakzai tribes, combined with a policy of non-interference with the tribes, led to stability in the region throughout Abdur Rahman&#x27;s reign. This continued during the rule of his son Habibullah, who died in 1919.

===20th century development projects===
An important development was the re-construction of the Nahr-e Saraj canal, beginning in 1910. Newly irrigated areas that had previously been desert were now populated with ethnic and tribal groups who were not originally from Helmand, including refugees from Central Asia fleeing Soviet rule. Many of the villages along the canal therefore are named after these groups, such as Uzbek, Turkmen, and Popolzai. The government had originally planned to continue developing the Helmand area during the 1920s, but ended up shelving that project due to unrest over Amanullah&#x27;s social reforms. In 1936, after the Musahiban dynasty had come to power, the government began construction of another canal in Helmand, the Nahr-e Bughra. The Afghan government originally sought out US financial and technical assistance, but the US refused, so instead it was the Germans and Japanese who contributed. The Nahr-e Bughra project employed up to 7,000 workers, and there were also other small-scale development projects in the area at the same time. Roads, bridges, and telephone wires were built to connect the major settlements. This was the first externally supervised development project in Helmand. However, when World War II broke out, the British requested that the German and Japanese engineers be expelled from Afghanistan, and the government had to continue on its own.

Helmand was the center of the USAID program in the 1960s to develop the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority (HAVA) – it became known locally as &quot;little America&quot;. The program laid out tree-lined streets in Lashkargah, built a network of irrigation canals and constructed a large hydroelectric dam. The development program was abandoned when pro-Soviet Union forces seized power in 1978, although much of the province is still irrigated by the HAVA.

===Administrative changes===
Thanks in part to the irrigation projects, the Pusht-e Rud area had become more important, and the government recognized this by splitting it off from Farah Province to create a new &quot;Gereshk Province&quot; in 1960. Gereshk was made the capital to reflect the historical importance of the Barakzai, which had been diluted by the influx of outside settlers in the province. The US, however, cared more that the HVA headquarters was in Lashkar Gah, and they successfully lobbied the Afghan government to relocate the provincial capital there. This happened in 1964, and the province was renamed &quot;Helmand Province&quot;.

For the first time since 1826, the Helmandi Barakzai were no longer dominant in the region. To compensate for this, the government completelty redrew the district boundaries in Helmand. The four traditional districts were abolished and replaced new districts. These new districts, greater in number than the traditional ones, were each assigned an &quot;order&quot;, which determined how much resources would be allocated to each district. Additionally, since the 1964 constitution introduced voting, the new districts were drawn in a way allowing the government to maintain influence and control.

The former Barakzai-dominated district of Pusht-e Rud proper, or Gereshk, was split into Nahr-e Seraj (the only 1st order district in the province), Nawa (4th order), and Lashkar Gah (which, as the capital, had its own resourcing protocol). Lashkar Gah district was gerrymandered to give the Barakzai a majority over the mixed tribes in the urban area: a slice of Barakzai-dominated Babaji was included, and the boundary with Nad-e Ali district was drawn on the border of Barakzai territory in Bolan. This way, the Barakzai central government was able to retain control of even the new capital of Helmand.

Meanwhile, the Alizai district of Zamindawar was split into Musa Qala (2nd order), Baghran (4th order), and Kajaki (sub-district status). Now Zad, with its mixed Noorzai and Ishaqzai population, was split into Now Zad (2nd order) and Washir (sub-district status). Garmsir district was the only one of the traditional districts to remain intact; it was given 3rd-order status. The 37 different tribes and ethnicities who had immigrated to Nad-e Ali and Marjah were lumped into a single 3rd-order district. Finally, the sub-district of Sangin was created to separate the Alikozai tribe, closely related to the Barakzai, from the Alizai.

===21st century===

During Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Agency for International Development program contributed to a counter-narcotics initiative called the Alternative Livelihoods Program (ALP) in the province. It paid communities to work to improve their environment and economic infrastructure as an alternative to opium poppy farming. The project undertook drainage and canal rehabilitation projects. In 2005 and 2006, there were problems in getting promised finance to communities and this was a source of considerable tension between the farmers and the Coalition forces.

After it was decided to deploy British troops to the Province, PJHQ tasked 22 SAS to conduct a reconnaissance of the province. The review was led by Mark Carleton-Smith, who found the province largely at peace due to the brutal rule of Sher Mohammad Akhundzada, and a booming opium-fuelled economy that benefited the pro-government warlords. In June he reported back to the MoD warning them not to remove Akhundzada and against the deployment of a large British force which would likely cause conflict where none existed.

It was announced in January 2006 in the British Parliament that International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) would replace the U.S. troops in the province as part of Operation Herrick. The British 16 Air Assault Brigade would be the core of the force in Helmand Province. British bases were located in the districts of Sangin, Lashkargah and Grishk. British forces were replaced in Sangin by elements of the United States Marine Corps I Marine Expeditionary Force Forward.
In summer 2006, Helmand was one of the provinces involved in Operation Mountain Thrust, a combined NATO-Afghan mission targeted at Taliban fighters in the south of the country. In July 2006, this offensive mission essentially stalled in Helmand as NATO, primarily British, and Afghan troops were forced to take increasingly defensive positions under heavy insurgent pressure. In response, British troop levels in the province were increased, and new encampments were established in Sangin and Grishk. Fighting was particularly heavy in the districts of Sangin, Naway, Nawzad and Garmsir. There were reports that the Taliban saw Helmand province as a key testing area for their ability to take and hold Afghan territory from NATO-led Afghan National Security Forces. Commanders on the ground described the situation as the most brutal conflict the British Army had been involved in since the Korean War.

In Autumn 2006, British troops started to reach &quot;cessation of hostilities&quot; agreements with local Taliban forces around the district centers where they had been stationed earlier in the summer. Under the terms of the agreement, both sets of forces were to withdraw from the conflict zone. This agreement from the British forces implied that the strategy of holding key bases in the district, as requested by Afghan President Hamid Karzai, was essentially untenable with the levels of British troop deployment. The agreement was also a setback for Taliban fighters, who were desperate to consolidate their gains in the province, but were under heavy pressure from various NATO offensives.
News reports identified the insurgents involved in the fighting as a mix of Taliban fighters and warring tribal groups who are heavily involved in the province&#x27;s lucrative opium trade. Given the amount of drugs produced in the area, it is likely that foreign drug traffickers were also involved.

Fighting continued throughout the winter, with British and allied troops taking a more pro-active stance against the Taliban insurgents. Several operations were launched including &quot;Operation Silicone&quot; at the start of spring. In May 2007, Mullah Dadullah, one of the Taliban&#x27;s top commanders, along with 11 of his men were killed by NATO-led Afghan forces in Helmand.
In April 2008, about 1,500 2nd Battalion 7th Marines occupied over of Helmand River valley and neighboring Farah Province. The operation was to set up forward operation bases and train the Afghan National Police in an area with little or no outside support.

Also in 2008, an Embedded Training Team from the Oregon Army National Guard led a Kandak of Afghan National Army troops in fighting against the Taliban in Lashkargah, as seen in the documentary Shepherds of Helmand.

In June 2009, &quot;Operation Panther&#x27;s Claw&quot; was launched with the stated aim of securing control of various canal and river crossings and establishing a lasting ISAF presence in an area described by Lt. Col. Richardson as &quot;one of the main Taliban strongholds&quot; ahead of the 2009 Afghan presidential election.
In July 2009, around 4,000 U.S. Marines pushed into the Helmand River valley in a major offensive to liberate the area from Taliban insurgents. The operation, dubbed Operation Khanjar (&quot;Operation Dagger&quot;), was the first major push since U.S. President Obama&#x27;s request for 21,000 additional soldiers in Afghanistan, targeting the Taliban insurgents.

In February 2013, &quot;BBC&quot; reported that corruption occurs in Afghan National Police bases, with some bases arming children, using them as servants and sometimes sexually abusing them; in early March 2013, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that government corruption is rampant with routine accusations against the police of shaking down and sexually abusing civilians causing loyalty to the government to be weaker.

On 13 August 2021, the capital of the province Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban after weeks of fighting in the Battle of Lashkargah. Around 1,500 Afghan soldiers were said to have surrendered, leaving the province in Taliban hands. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the US withdrawal and Taliban victory was mostly met with relief in Helmand; the province had suffered through some of the deadliest battles of the war from 2001 to 2021 and heavy US-led bombardments.

==Transport==
Bost Airport serves the population of Helmand for domestic flights to other parts of the country. It is designed for civilian use. NATO-led forces heavily used the airport at Camp Shorabak, formerly Camp Bastion. Camp Leatherneck, which used to be the main British base in Afghanistan during the occupation, is also adjacent. All sites were claimed by the Taliban on 13 August 2021.

There is no rail service. Primary roads include the ring road passes through Helmand from Kandahar to Delaram. There is a major north–south route (Highway 611) that goes from Lashkargah to Sangin. About 33% of Helmands roads are not passable during certain seasons and in some areas, there are no roads at all.

==Economy==

Farming is the main source of income for the majority. This includes agriculture and animal husbandry. Animals include cows, sheep, goats, and chicken. Donkeys and camels are used for labor. The province has a potential for fishery. The region produces the following: opium, tobacco, cotton, wheat and potato.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 28% in 2005 to 3% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 2% in 2005 to 3% in 2011.

==Education==
The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 5% in 2005 to 12% in 2011.
The overall net enrollment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 6% in 2005 to 4% in 2011.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the population of Helmand Province is about 1,446,230. It is mostly a tribal and rural society, with the ethnic Pashtuns being predominant; there is a significant Baloch minority in the south, and there is small minority of Tajiks, and a significant minority of Hazaras in the far northern regions of the province. The Pashtuns are divided into the following tribes: Barakzai (32%), Nurzai (16%), Alakozai (9%), and Eshaqzai (5.2%). All the inhabitants practice Sunni Islam except the small number of Hazaras who are Shi&#x27;as and the Sikhs who follow Sikhism. 53.5% of the population lived below the national poverty line.

<doc id="457237" wikidata="Q183036" url="?curid=457237" title="Jowzjan Province">
<text>Jowzjan, sometimes spelled Jawzjan or Jowzjan () is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the north of the country bordering neighboring Turkmenistan. The province is divided into 11 districts and contains hundreds of villages. It has a population of about 613,481 residents, which is a multi-ethnic society. Sheberghan is the capital of Jowzjan province.

==Etymology==
It is thought that the name is an Arabicized version of the Persian word gowzgān &quot;(Land of) Walnuts&quot;.

==History==

The province is named after the early medieval region and principality of Juzjan. Between the early 16th century and mid-18th century, the area was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara. It was conquered by Ahmad Shah Durrani and became part of the Durrani Empire in or about 1750, which formed to the modern state of Afghanistan. The area was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan wars that were fought in the 19th and 20th centuries.

===Recent history===
Following a series of changing allegiances and falling out with Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik Pahlawan in 1997, the Taliban withdrew from the area, but in 1998 a contingent of 8,000 Taliban fighters pressed through neighboring Faryab, seizing Abdul Rashid Dostum&#x27;s headquarters in Sheberghan.
A Swedish-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), which was based in Mazar-e-Sharif since about 2005 and responsible for four provinces including Jowzjan, established an office and some troops in the province. Security situation in the province has rapidly deteriorated in 2009 and 2010. A new Turkish PRT was also established in the province in the summer of 2010, providing security to the area which also covered Sar-e Pol. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANFS) began expanding in the last decade and gradually took over security from the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border is maintained by the Afghan Border Force while law and order for the rest of the province is provided by the Afghan National Police.

Although it was regarded as a relatively secured place compared to some other provinces of Afghanistan, there was an increasing number of incidents particularly in Darzab, Qosh Tepa and Fayzabad districts. The Mazar-e-Sharif-Sheberghan highway (called Aqyol) had turned into a dangerous traveling route because of militants carrying out attacks, mainly against government forces.

In April 2012, construction of a mega power network with power pylons carrying 500 megawatts of electricity from neighboring Turkmenistan started in the province; the project is supported by Turkmenistan and Turkey. Initial work on the $390 million project had already been completed. Turkmenistan began installing power pylons over a distance of 374 kilometres on its soil toward the Afghanistan border. The network supplies electricity to many areas in Jowzjan, Balkh, Sar-e Pol, Faryab and Kabul provinces.

==Health==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 24% in 2005 to 44% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 9% in 2005 to 21% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 31% in 2005 to 16% in 2011.
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 40% in 2005 to 46% in 2011. The primary school numbers in the province as of 2011 accounts for 116 

==Geography and demographics==

Jowzjan is situated in the northern part of Afghanistan, bordering Turkmenistan in the north, Balkh province in the east, Sar-e Pol province in the south and Faryab province in the west. Jowzjan province covers an area of 10,326 km2. More than one quarter of the province is mountainous or semi mountainous terrain (29.4%), while more than two thirds of the area is made up of flat land (68.9%). It is one of the provinces known to contain petroleum and natural gas. Mining and agriculture are the main industries.

Latest estimates suggest that Jowzjan has a population of around 613,481 residents. They belong to the nation&#x27;s various ethnic groups with the majority being ethnic Turkmen and Uzbeks. Approximately 39.5% of the population speaks Uzbek, 28.7% speaks Turkmen, 17.2% speak Pashto, 12.1% speaks Dari and 2.5% speaks other languages. Around 14.1% of the population lived below the national poverty line.

<text>Kabul (Dari/Pashto: ), situated in the east of the country, is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan. The capital of the province is Kabul city, which is Afghanistan&#x27;s capital and largest city. The population of the Kabul Province is over 5.5 million people as of 2022, of which over 85 percent live in urban areas. The current governor of the province is Qari Baryal.

It borders the provinces of Parwan to the north, Kapisa to the north-east, Laghman to the east, Nangarhar to the south-east, Logar to the south, and Wardak to the west.

==Geography==
Kabul is located between Latitude 34-31&#x27; North and Longitude 69-12&#x27; East at an altitude of 1800 m (6000 feet) above sea level, which makes it one of the world&#x27;s highest capital cities. Kabul is strategically situated in a valley surrounded by high mountains at crossroads of north-south and east-west trade routes. One million years ago the Kabul region was surrounded from south-east between Lowgar and Paghman Mountains; Charikar in the north and the Ningai Ghar mountains in the west. This region formed an icy sea. Some deep wells in the region of today&#x27;s Poli Charkhi in the east part of city are the evidence of that time. Kabul is surrounded by &quot;Koh-e Paghman&quot; Mountain from the east, &quot;Koh-e Qrough&quot; Mountain from the south-west and Koh-e Shirdarwaza Mountain from the north-east. Kabul has only one river which is called Kabul River. Kabul River rises at the Paghman Mountain toward South Pass about west of Kabul. It flows in an easterly direction, past Kabul, and through Jalalabad city, and then on to Dakka where it enters Pakistani territory and finally runs into the Indus at Attock.

The climate within region of Kabul is considered to be arid to semi-arid steppe. Because of the very low amounts of precipitation, especially from May to November, Kabul can be very dry and dusty. Extreme temperature changes occur from night to day, season to season, and from place to place. The chief characteristic of Afghanistan&#x27;s climate is a blue cloudless sky with over 300 days of sunshine yearly. Even during the winter, skies usually remain clear between snowfalls, which are on average annually. The daily temperature for Kabul city in winter is and in summer . The coldest month of the year is January and the hottest month is July. The maximum temperature has been recorded as +42.7 °C in July and the minimum as −26.3 °C in January.

==History==

Kabul&#x27;s history dates back more than 3,500 years. It was once the center of Zoroastrianism and subsequently also a home for Buddhists and Hindus.

The native citizens of Kabul as per the records of the British Museum are Tajiks and Pashtuns.

The city was invaded by Arab Muslims in the 7th century by introducing Islam but was slowly taken back by the Hindu Shahis of Kabul. It was re-invaded by the Saffarids and Samanids in the 9th century followed by Mahmud of Ghaznavi in the 11th century, when the Hindu Shahi King Jay Pala committed suicide. It became part of the Ghurids after defeating the Ghaznavids, and later it was invaded by the Mongols under Genghis Khan.

Timur, founder of the Timurid dynasty, invaded the region in 14th century and developed it into a major trading center. In 1504, the city fell to Babur from the north of the country and was made into his capital, which became one of the principal cities of his later Mughal Empire. In 1525, Babur described Kabulistan in his memoirs by writing that:

For much of its time Kabul was independent until it became part of the Durrani Empire in 1747. During the First Anglo-Afghan War in 1839, the British army invaded the area but withdrew in 1842, although thousands of them were killed during a surprise ambush on their way to Jalalabad. In retaliation another British force partly burned Kabul before retreating back to British India. The British again occupied the city during the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1879, after their resident staff were massacred there, but withdrew about a year later when they installed Emir.

In 1919, King Amanullah Khan rose to power during the Third Anglo-Afghan War when Afghanistan&#x27;s capital and its eastern city of Jalalabad were air raided by the No. 31 and 114 squadrons of the British Royal Air Force in May 1919. Amanullah Khan defeated the British and began modernization of the country after the signing of the Treaty of Rawalpindi. In the late 1920s, switching of power took place until Zahir Shah became the youngest new King.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Kabul was known as the Paris of central Asia as it was transforming into a European style city. Once the jewel of Asia, a very progressive and moderately modern capital. Kabul in those days had, modern cinemas, cafes, formal French gardens, schools, libraries, universities, fine boutiques. The inhabitants of Kabul known as &quot;Kabulis&quot; were highly educated, modern, progressive and cosmopolitan people. Where women and men attended primary school, high school and university. Mini-jupes (mini skirts) were a common sight in the 1970s. Highly educated, culturally aware and yet religious at the same time, there was never an issue with not having your hair covered or the clothes you wore in the Kabul of the 1960s and 1970s. This progressive peaceful society lasted until foreign interference occurred in the late 1970s plummeting the country to what Afghanistan has become today. In December 1979, Soviet armed forces landed at Kabul International Airport to help bolster the PDPA-led government of Afghanistan.

Kabul became the Soviet command center for approximately 10 years during their stay in Afghanistan. In February 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan after they were defeated by the Mujahideens. In spring of 1992 the government of Mohammad Najibullah collapsed, Kabul fell into the hands of Mujahideen forces. Destruction increased as the coalition of the parties broke into rival warring factions, and much of Kabul was damaged. In 1996 the Taliban took over the region and started a new strict Islamic Sharia rule which restricted most forms of education, entertainment, women from working, men from shaving beards, and many normal human activities or hobbies.

Less than a month after the September 11 attacks in the United States, in October 2001, the United States Armed Forces assisted by British Armed Forces provided massive air support to United Front (Northern Alliance) ground forces during Operation Enduring Freedom. The Taliban abandoned Kabul and the United Front came to take control of the city. In December 2001 Kabul became the capital of the Afghan Transitional Administration, which transformed to the present Government of Afghanistan that is led by President Hamid Karzai.

In early 2002 a NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was deployed in Kabul and from there they began taking over other parts of the country. The war-torn city began to see some positive development as millions of expats returned to the country. Its population has grown from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million by 2007. Many foreign embassies re-opened, especially the biggest U.S. Embassy. Afghan government institutions were also re-developed and modernized. Since 2008 the newly trained Afghan National Police (ANP) and the Afghan National Army (ANA) have been in charge of security in the area, while NATO also has a heavy presence but is not patrolling the streets anymore.

While the city is being developed, it is also the scene of occasional deadly suicide bombings and explosions carried out by the Haqqani network, Taliban&#x27;s Quetta Shura, Hezb-i Islami, Al Qaeda, and other anti-government elements who are allegedly supported and guided by Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy network.

==Politics==
Kabul was occupied by a number of mujahideen rebel groups and warlords before Najibullah&#x27;s government collapsed in 1992. The city and province were contested by the various rebel forces who fought for power until it was captured by the Taliban in 1996. A new strict law was introduced by the Taliban. There was very little information on how Afghanistan was governed but the country had only one leader, Mullah Omar, the head of Taliban who fled to Pakistan after the US-led invasion on October 7, 2001. The Taliban laws were quickly abolished and humanities came in effect to enable Kabul to recover from the destruction caused by the mujahideen and Taliban forces. The 2002 loya jirga took place to solve the country&#x27;s political problems.

Afghanistan adopted a new constitution in January 2004, establishing the country as an Islamic Republic. According to the constitution, the Afghan government consists of a President, two Vice Presidents, and a National Assembly (Parliament). The National Assembly has two houses: the House of People (Wolesi Jirga), and the House of Elders (Meshrano Jirga). There is also an independent Judiciary branch consisting of the Supreme Court (Stara Mahkama), High Courts and Appeal Courts. The President appoints the members of the Supreme Court with the approval of the Wolesi Jirga.

Afghanistan&#x27;s presidential elections were held in October 2004. Over 8 million Afghans voted in the elections. The Joint Electoral Management Body of Afghanistan certified the elections and declared Hamid Karzai, the interim President, the winner with 55.4% of the vote. Karzai&#x27;s strongest opponent, Yunus Qanuni, received 16.3% of the vote. The elections were not without controversy; allegations of fraud and ballot stuffing were brought up by many of the presidential candidates including Qanuni. A panel of international experts was set up to investigate the matter. The panel did find evidence of voting irregularities, however, they said that it was not enough to affect the outcome of the elections.

==Economy==
Kabul&#x27;s products include: natural gas, cotton, wool, carpets, agriculture, and some small production companies. Kabul has trade partnerships with the UK, France, Germany, United States, India, South Korea, Turkmenistan, Kenya, Russia, Pakistan, China, Iran. Kabul&#x27;s economy was influenced by the America and has increased by almost 3500% after shrinking for 25 years. A new currency was introduced to Afghans which helped the economy. New business was in the new regime. Many American industries were interested in the new Kabul and many new companies have since then opened their branches in Kabul. The Kabul City Centre Mall was built and has nearly 100 shops.

The economy is at a boom level and is increasing dramatically. Housing costs are rising as are employee wages. The cost of living has increased dramatically which is a problem for the non-educated Afghans, who cannot support themselves. The UN helps Afghans in need of help by providing aid, food and school materials for schools. Many international aid organizations are contributing to the Afghan economy.

===Tourism===
In the 1960s and 70s most of Kabul&#x27;s economy depended on tourism. Kabul had textile, cotton production, and carpet production industries, but most of its economy came through tourism which it lost during its destruction.

== Demographics and administration ==
As of 2022, the total population of Kabul province is 5,572,630, of which about 85 percent live in the urban areas (mainly in the Kabul metropolitan area) while the remaining 15 percent are rural residents. It is one of the most ethnically diverse provinces.

The city of Kabul is multi-ethnic. As of 2003, it is composed of 60% Tajiks, 15% Pashtuns, 15% Hazaras, 2% Uzbeks, 1% Baloch, 1% Turkmen, and 1% Hindu. The Dari and Pashto languages are widely used in the region.

===Districts===

==Transportation==
Transportation in Kabul is improving as the number of new vehicles and experienced drivers continues to grow. Public transportation services are available in the Kabul vicinity, but many roads are still in disrepair. Drivers also face challenges from the large number of cyclists. However, more vehicles are appearing in the city as car ownership increases. Taxis are widely available throughout Kabul, including in most districts, providing an essential mode of transport for locals and visitors.

Since the Taliban&#x27;s return to power, local taxi services have improved as new roads are being constructed and public transportation infrastructure is being enhanced. Several companies are also working to further improve transportation options in the city. For instance, Tour.af, a company specializing in tourism and transportation, is planning to introduce an online taxi service to make travel within Kabul more convenient and accessible. This initiative is part of their broader efforts to support tourism and provide reliable transportation services in Afghanistan.

Kabul&#x27;s Milli Bus (National Bus) system, with approximately 800 buses, continues to serve the city and nearby areas. In addition, several new highways have been constructed in the province, and the government is committed to rebuilding smaller roads. Funding for these improvements comes from toll charges paid by drivers using highways and major roads. Motorists are required to obtain inspection certificates, issued monthly, quarterly, or annually, which are displayed on vehicle windshields.

Trucks are commonly used to transport goods between districts or to other cities in the country. With the support of foreign companies and organizations, the Afghan government has initiated extensive roadwork to improve Kabul’s infrastructure. Auto companies like Honda, Toyota, Ford Motor Company, and Chevrolet have also re-entered the Kabul market, further diversifying transportation options.

==Healthcare==
The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 65% in 2005 to 56% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 46% in 2005 to 73% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 58% in 2005 to 47% in 2011. The overall net enrollment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 46% in 2005 to 65% in 2011.

Kabul is Afghanistan&#x27;s center for education. People from all the provinces of the country come to Kabul for education. There are many schools and universities that have opened doors for men and women. In the 1970s, about 55% of Kabul&#x27;s population was educated without materials or proper learning resources, but nowadays most of the young children are sent to work by their parents to support their living costs. The education rate has declined dramatically during the last 20 years. Most of the schools in Kabul were set as battle points during the wars and have been demolished.

<text>Kandahār (; &quot;Kandahār&quot;, ; &quot;Qandahār&quot;) is one of the thirty four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the southern part of the country, sharing a border with Pakistan, to the south. It is surrounded by Helmand in the west, Uruzgan in the north and Zabul Province in the east. Its capital is the city of Kandahar, Afghanistan&#x27;s second largest city, located on the Arghandab River. The greater region surrounding the province is called Loy Kandahar. The Emir of Afghanistan sends orders to Kabul from Kandahar making it the de facto capital of Afghanistan, although the main government body operates in Kabul. All meetings with the Emir take place in Kandahar, meetings excluding the Emir are in Kabul.

The province contains about 18 districts, over 1,000 villages, and approximately 1,431,876 people (the 6th most populous province), which is mostly tribal and a rural society. The main inhabitants of Kandahar province are the ethnic Pashtuns. They are followed by the Baloch people, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens and Hazaras.

== Etymology ==
There is speculation revolving around the origin of the name &quot;Kandahar&quot;. The name Kandahar () is believed to be linguistically corrupted form of a word Gandhāra (), which was used between 2000-1700 BCE. It is also believed to have started as one of many cities named after the Hellenistic conqueror Alexander the Great throughout his vast (mainly ex-Achaemenid) empire, its present form deriving from the Pashto rendering of Arabic &quot;Iskandariya&quot; = Ancient Alexandria (in Arachosia).

A temple to the deified Alexander as well as an inscription in Greek and Aramaic by the emperor Ashoka, who lived a few decades later, have been discovered in the old citadel.

==History==
Excavations of prehistoric sites by archaeologists such as Louis Dupree and others suggest that the region around Kandahar is one of the oldest known human settlements so far.

The area was called Arachosia and was a frequent target for conquest because of its strategic location in Asia, which connects Southern, Central and Southwest Asia. It was part of the Medes territory before falling to the Achaemenids. In 330 BC it was invaded by Alexander the Great and became part of the Seleucid Empire following his death. The city then became a center of trade.

Later Kandahar came under the influence of the Indian emperor Ashoka, who erected a pillar there with a bilingual inscription in Greek and Aramaic. The territory was ruled by the Zunbils before Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate arrived in the 7th century CE. 
The Arabs advanced through Sistan and conquered Sindh early in the eighth century. Elsewhere however their incursions were no more than temporary, and it was not until the rise of the Saffarid dynasty in the ninth century that the frontiers of Islam effectively reached Ghazni and Kabul. Even then a Hindu dynasty the Hindushahis, held Gandhara and eastern borders.

From the tenth century onwards, as Persian language and culture continued to spread into Afghanistan, the focus of power shifted to Ghazni, where a Turkic dynasty (from the Samanid city of Bokhara) proceeded to create an empire of their own. The greatest of the Ghaznavids was Mahmud, who ruled between 998 and 1030. He expelled the Hindus from Ghandhara.

Mahmud of Ghazni made the area part of the Ghaznavids in the 10th century, who were replaced by the Ghurids. After the destructions caused by Genghis Khan in the 13th century, the Timurids established rule and began rebuilding cities. From about 1383 until his death in 1407, Kandahar was governed by Pir Muhammad, a grandson of Timur.

In the early 16th century, Kandahar briefly fell to Babur. From then on the province was controlled by the Shia Safavids, as their easternmost territories. They regularly had wars with the Sunni Mughals, who ruled Kandahar as a short-lived &quot;subah&quot; (imperial province) from the 1638 conquest until its loss in 1648 to one of the Safavids&#x27; rivals.

Starting in 1709, Mir Wais Hotak rebelled against the Safavids and established the Hotaki dynasty, which became a powerful empire. In 1729, Nader Shah declared war on the Ghilzai rulers. By 1738, the last Hotaki ruler Shah Hussain was defeated in what is now Old Kandahar.

Ahmad Shah Durrani, the founding father of Afghanistan, gained control of the province in 1747 and made the city of Kandahar the capital of his new Afghan Empire. In the 1770s, the capital of the empire was transferred to Kabul. Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s mausoleum is located in the center of the city.

British-led Indian forces occupied the province during the First Anglo-Afghan War from 1832 to 1842. They also occupied the city during the Second Anglo-Afghan War from 1878 to 1880. It remained peaceful for about 100 years until the late 1970s.

=== 20th century ===
In the mid-20th century until 1979, Kandahar city was a major stop on a popular road to India used by hippies.

In December 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. This led to a war that lasted for years, between the Soviets and a rebellion by local guerrilla groups, known as the Mujahideen. The groups were usually made up of fellow members of local tribes, and were led by a chief who inherited the title.

In 1985, a major guerrilla commander, Esmatullah Muslim, joined the forces of the pro-Soviet Afghan government in Kandahar. A leading official of Afghanistan&#x27;s Communist Party, Hayat Khan, was killed by guerrillas in the province August 1985. The Soviets carpet-bombed the province&#x27;s southern districts in 1986. Kandahar city became &quot;mostly ruins&quot;. Guerilla plans for taking the unoccupied city were thwarted when the Soviet and Afghan government forces returned there in 1988. The Soviets eventually withdrew from the country.

In the early 1990s, the province&#x27;s governor was Gul Agha Shirzai. The province under his reign was described as anarchic.

The Taliban began in Kandahar in 1994, when Mullah Omar (previously an ally of Mujahideen warlord Rais Abdul Wahid) started an Islamist movement against misrule by the Mujadhideen. He would become Taliban&#x27;s Supreme Leader. The Taliban would take over almost all of Afghanistan. Under a version of Sharia law, they oppressed women heavily, although there were some minor moves towards equality in 2000. In 1997, due to international pressure, they began a campaign to rid the province of opium and heroin production, but the campaign failed.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====

In October 2001, as a response to the September 11 attacks, the United States and NATO (aided by the Northern Alliance) invaded Afghanistan to depose the Taliban. This began the War on Terror. Initially, it was an air war, and included the bombing of multiple targets near Kandahar city&#x27;s airport. On the 20th, the war&#x27;s first ground operation began with a U.S. commando raid near the airport, which the Taliban claimed was unsuccessful.

In December, Kandahar city fell to the invading forces, marking the end of Taliban government at that point. Mullah Omar&#x27;s presidential palace was bombed by U.S. forces, later being rebuilt and used as a complex for U.S. Special Forces. Omar went into hiding, and pledged to keep fighting against the invasion. In a deal with the U.S., the surrendering Taliban agreed to give up in the province. Two of the commanders who fought in Kandahar prior to the surrender were Gul Agha Shirzai, who became the province&#x27;s governor again, and Hamid Karzai, who became the president of Afghanistan.

Kandahar city became a base of U.S. army forces (at Kandahar Airfield), new construction efforts, and was the site of an assassination attempt on Hamid Karzai.

In the following years, a new Taliban insurgency fought against the U.S. and NATO, mostly in Kandahar and Helmand Province. At the same time, the U.S. was searching for Osama bin Laden. Arrested terrorists or suspected terrorists were sent from the Kandahar detention center to the Guantanamo Bay naval base. Afghans detained by Canadian troops were handed over to Afghan&#x27;s intelligence police, the National Directorate of Security, who (without Canadian knowledge) tortured the detainees during interrogation in jail.

Despite a new focus on gender equality, a dysfunctional legal system allowed for the continuing sale of child brides in the province. This was especially common in its northeastern area, which was discovered to be a Taliban stronghold. By 2004, U.S. and Afghan forces had started a guerrilla war against them.

There was a surge in Taliban attacks in May 2006, which caused an influx of villagers across the province to leave their homes for bigger cities. Also that month, a top Taliban commander, Mullah Dadullah, was arrested. In June, a car bomb almost killed the provincial governor. Meanwhile, the U.S. started transferring authority over the province to NATO, which the Taliban used as an opportunity to move in west of Kandahar city, likely to threaten it. The U.S. and NATO started Operation Medusa in September, which reportedly killed, captured, and expelled hundreds of insurgents. However, plenty of civilian property was destroyed. A reconstruction effort began, named Operation Baaz Tsuka.

In 2009, the U.S. started planning for a new anti-Taliban operation in the province, building a presence around Kandahar city. Their Stryker Brigade was sent to the district of Spinboldak, on the Pakistan border, to shut down Taliban infiltration routes.

==== 2010s ====
In 2010, Kandahar was considered the most dangerous province in the country. It had a lack of government workers, which caused an influx of insurgents. Four of its 17 districts were under Taliban control. Health services and education were &quot;virtually absent&quot; outside of certain towns. In March, a major provincial official, Abdul Majeed Babai, was shot and killed. In the spring, the U.S. experienced fighting before their operation could start. They attempted to attain the military backing of two influential leaders in the region, the warlord Haji Ghani and tribal leader Haji Lala, but only Ghani was receptive. Later, there were two notable incidents of U.S. soldiers massacring Afghan civilians in Maiwand District and Panjwai District.

The U.S. and NATO&#x27;s combat mission in Afghanistan formally ended in 2014. By 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote Kandahar city was considered &quot;largely secure by Afghan standards&quot;. It had gained an extensive police force and blast walls, and commercial and domestic flights had restarted there. However, that year, the U.S. pulled funding from various development programs in the region, and there were fears it could lead to a strengthened Taliban; the Afghan national security forces were &quot;strained&quot; in the absence of international troops.

In 2018, Afghanistan&#x27;s election commission delayed elections in Kandahar after two senior provincial officials (its police commander and intelligence agency commander) were killed in a Taliban-claimed shooting. The vote eventually took place, peacefully.
==== 2020s ====
In 2021, as the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, a Taliban offensive started taking over Afghanistan. On May 1, the U.S. withdrew from Kandahar, and the Taliban started taking nearby districts to Kandahar city. The fighting displaced 150,000 people living nearby. They took the city on August 12. Following this, women and girls in the province were banned from multiple institutions. In 2023, the office of the Taliban&#x27;s spokesman was moved from Kabul to Kandahar.

==Politics and governance==
Yousaf Wafa is the current governor of the province. His predecessor was Rohullah Khanzada. In early 2003, Hamid Karzai transferred Sherzai from Kandahar to Jalalabad as Governor of Nangarhar Province. Sherzai was replaced by Yousef Pashtun in Kandahar. I

==Demographics==
According to the National Statistics and Information Authority (NSIA), the total population of the province was estimated at 1,431,876. Pashtuns make up the majority in province. There are also communities of Baloch people, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Hazaras and others. The main language spoken throughout the province is Pashto. Dari and Balochi is also understood by some, especially in the city of Kandahar where learning of Dari as a second language is promoted in public schools.

==Transport and economy==
The Ahmad Shah Baba International Airport is located east of the city of Kandahar. It is for civilian and military use. It serves the population of southern Afghanistan by providing domestic flights to other cities and international flights to Dubai, Pakistan, Iran and other regional countries. The airport was built by the United States in the 1960s under the United States Agency for International Development program. It was later used by Soviet and Afghan forces during the 1980s and again during the 2001–2021 NATO-led war. The airport was upgraded and expanded during the last decade by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

There is currently no rail service but reports indicate that at least one will be built between the city of Kandahar and the border town of Spin Boldak in the south, which will then connect with Pakistan Railways. Ground transport of goods is carried by trucks and cars. A number of important roads run through the province and this helps the area&#x27;s economy. The town of Spin Boldak serves as a major transporting, shipping, and receiving site. It is being developed so that trade with neighboring Pakistan increases.

Kandahar province has bus services to major towns and village headquarters. Its capital, Kandahar, used to have a city bus service that took commuters on daily routes to different destinations throughout the city. There are taxicabs that provide transportation service inside the city as well as throughout the province. Other traditional methods of ground transportation are also used. Private vehicles are on the rise in the country, with large showrooms selling new or second-hand vehicles imported from the United Arab Emirates. More people are buying new cars as the roads and highways are being improved.

Kandahar has been known for having well-irrigated gardens and orchards, and was famous for its grapes, melons, and pomegranates. The main source of trade is to Pakistan, Iran and other regional countries. Kandahar is an agricultural area and several of the districts are irrigated by the Helmand and Arghandab Valley Authority. The Dahla Dam is located in the province, north of the city of Kandahar. There are approximately 700 greenhouses in the entire province but farmers want the government to build more.

==Healthcare==
There are a number of hospitals in the province, most of them in the city of Kandahar. These include Aino Mina Hospital, Al Farhad Hospital, Ayoubi Hospital, Mirwais Hospital, Mohmand Hospital, Sial Curative Hospital and Sidal Hospital.

==Education==
Kandahar University is one of the largest educational institutions in the province. It has over 5,000 students, about 300 of which are female students. In partnership with the Asia Foundation, Kandahar University conducted a pilot project that provided female high school graduates with a four-month refresher course to prepare for the college entrance examination. The university is one of two universities in Kandahar that serve all of southern Afghanistan. The conditions in the university are poor but improving slowly. Kandahar University is far behind many of the other universities in the country because of insecurity and shortage of funding,

There are approximately 377 public and private schools in Kandahar province. The total number of students is 362,000. Of this, 79,000 are female students. Due to insecurity and other issues, many female students drop out before obtaining a diploma. Almost 150 educational institutes were closed in the past, according to the education ministry. Some of the well known public schools in Kandahar are Ahmad Shah Baba High School, Mahmud Tarzi High School, Mirwais Hotak High School, Nazo Ana High School, Shah Mahmud Hotak High School, and Zarghuna Ana High School. Private schools include Afghan Turk High Schools.

<text>Kapisa ( ; Dari and Pashto: &quot;Kāpisā&quot;) is the smallest of Afghanistan&#x27;s thirty-four provinces and is located in the north-east of the country. It has an estimated population of 523,201 people and an area of , making it the most densely populated province apart from Kabul Province. It borders Panjshir Province to the north, Laghman Province to the east, Kabul Province to the south and Parwan Province to the west. Mahmud-i-Raqi is the provincial capital, while the most populous city and district of Kapisa is Nijrab.

==History==

The earliest references to Kapisa appear in the writings of the fifth century BCE Indian scholar Pāṇini. Pāṇini refers to the city of Kapiśi, a city of the Kapisa kingdom, modern Bagram. Pāṇini also refers to &quot;Kapiśayana&quot;, a famous wine from Kapisa. The city of Kapiśi also appeared as &quot;Kaviśiye&quot; on Graeco-Indian coins of Apollodotus I and Eucratides.

Archeological discoveries in 1939 confirmed that the city of Kapisa was an emporium for Kapiśayana wine, bringing to light numerous glass flasks, fish-shaped wine jars, and drinking cups typical of the wine trade of the era. The grapes (&quot;Kapiśayani Draksha&quot;) and wine (&quot;Kapiśayani Madhu&quot;) of the area are referred to in several works of ancient Indian literature. The epic Mahabharata also mentions the common practice of slavery in the city.

Based on the account of the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang, who visited in AD 644, it seems that in later times Kapisa was part of a kingdom ruled by a kshatriya king holding sway over ten neighboring states, including Lampaka, Nagarahara, Gandhara, and Banu. Xuanzang notes the Shen breed of horses from the area, and also notes the production of many types of cereals and fruits, as well as a scented root called Yu-kin.

===Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Mauryan Empire===

The Kapisa province territory fell to the Maurya Empire, which was led by Chandragupta Maurya. The Mauryas promoted both Buddhism and Hinduism to the region which was entirely Hindu for all its history till then, and were planning to capture more territory of Central Asia when they decimated local Greco-Bactrian forces and the chief general of Alexander Seleucus. Seleucus is said to have reached a peace treaty with Chandragupta by giving his daughter in marriage, control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas and 500 elephants.

Having consolidated power in the northwest, Chandragupta pushed east towards the Nanda Empire. Afghanistan&#x27;s significant ancient tangible and intangible Buddhist heritage is recorded through wide-ranging archeological finds, including religious and artistic remnants. Buddhist doctrines are reported to have even reached as far as Balkh during the life of the Buddha (563 BCE to 483 BCE), as recorded by Xuanzang.
==Recent history==

Just like the rest of Afghanistan, many historical sites in Kapisa have been looted by smugglers and then sold abroad. During 2009 and 2010 twenty-seven relics were discovered by the National Security forces; these included ancient relics belonging to 2 BC and 4 BC mostly from Kohistan district.

Before 2012, French forces were complemented by U.S. forces through Provincial Reconstruction Teams and Human Terrain Teams. The province was served by the Kapisa PRT, located at Forward Operating Base Morales-Frazier in Nijrab District. The PRT conducted counterinsurgency and stability operations in the province for more than six years, working with leaders of Kapisa at the provincial and district level, to bolster the capacity and credibility of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The PRT participated in key leader engagements, scouting areas for new projects, and performing quality checks and site visits on existing projects. The key focus was on building roads, bridges, construction of schools, and also improvements to power capabilities on existing infrastructure. Composed of U.S. Air Force, Army, State Department, and USAID subject matter experts and mentors, the team sought to work closely with key leaders to facilitate development. The vision was to foster a stable and secure environment ready for transition to the Afghan government.

By August 2008 the French mission was facing serious challenges. A shocking ambush in Surobi, the district of Kabul Province they were responsible for patrolling, killed 10 French troops. The Surobi massacre spurred a larger debate in France about the war. After taking over from the U.S., which exercised partial control over the province for several years beforehand, the French continued to follow the U.S.-led approach of sending troops through an area to kill or chase away militants. Like the American military, the French never developed a solid plan for consolidating their victories and building on successes – which left many areas of Kapisa in a constant tug-of-war between the French and the insurgents.

In early 2009, French forces embarked on a significant campaign which aimed to retake an eastern Alasay District that the Taliban has controlled for the previous year. Alasay district is a strategic goldmine: it lies along a primary infiltration route into and out of Pakistan, it provides easy access to Kabul in an easily defensible primary valley (there are two other valleys in Alasay District), and it is mostly populated by the ethnic minority the Pashai and some Nuristani. In a French-led NATO force initiated, the operation was a success initially, due to reaching out to locals beforehand, they retook the entire valley with a single casualty over a single day of fighting. Almost immediately, the Afghans of the valley welcomed the French, and things seemed to be looking up. However, they didn&#x27;t stay. Much as in previous efforts to &quot;sweep&quot; the province, the French were dragged into other tasks, like protecting the main highway that travels the province from north to south through the volatile Tagab Valley. As a result, Alasay fell back to Taliban later that year and the security situation in the province deteriorated. It was that same tug-of-war all over again, with the residents of Alasay left frustrated and less safe than ever before. As 2009 progressed, bigger and bigger chunks of the province came under the sway of the insurgency, leading the provincial capital being more or less under curfew from the militants. By 2010, the French had stopped liaising with their Afghan Army counterparts, and the Provincial Reconstruction Team had ceased most of its operations.

In late 2009, the province saw an influx of ISAF forces as the French elevated their presence from a Battalion-strength Task Force under Task Force Korrigan (Groupement tactique interarmes de Kapisa) to a Brigade-strength Task Force under Task Force Lafayette (Brigade La Fayette). At the same time, the Kapisa PRT, formerly the Parwan-Kapisa PRT, relocated from Bagram Airbase to FOB Morales-Frazier, focusing exclusively on operations in the Kapisa Province for the following three years.

The French military&#x27;s growing frustration with their inability to make progress resulted in tensions with the Afghans they were meant to support. These tensions stemmed in large part from the challenge of the overall ISAF missions to build support for the legitimate government of Afghanistan with the realities of the dysfunctional local government within Kapisa. The provincial governor, Ghulam Qawis Abubaker, was widely viewed as corrupt and was accused by contractors and district officials of funding insurgent elements in order to keep Kapisa unstable enough to keep PRT dollars coming into the province at higher levels, which in turn would widen the corruption problem. In 2010, the governor himself would be removed and charged by ISAF with corruption, though the Karzai administration would later refuse to prosecute the case. U.S. forces, including the PRT, also believed the Governor himself was responsible for the killing of the Panjsher PRT Commander in May 2009 (believing the Kapisa PRT commander to be the true objective) and of escalating attacks in northern Kapsia in Fall 2009 aimed at both PRT and French convoys as the counterinsurgency effort during this period shifted to Tagab and Alasay.

For much of the period leading up to this, the French forces, ISAF, and the U.S. PRT differed in strategies for dealing with the problem and whom to deal with among the Afghan population, eventually seeking out district-level shura approaches to fund projects at the community level and alleviate the concerns villagers had with existing projects and bypassing the provincial leadership. This strategy continued to gain support across the coalition elements as provincial officials were being arrested for having ties to the insurgency.

When a bombing in central district of Nijrab killed four French soldiers in June 2012, within France the bombing resonated deeply: while President Hollande had before indicated that he might keep some French troops in the country to help with the training mission, he later announced a full withdrawal by July. France being the fifth largest contributor to NATO&#x27;s ISAF coalition, with nearly 3,300 soldiers, began its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan in July and completed it by the end of the 2012. Kapisa transitioned to Afghan government control in third of the five-phase transfers. Withdrawing French troops by the end of 2012 had been one of President Hollande&#x27;s election pledges. The date meant that French forces left the country two years before the main scheduled NATO withdrawal.

The early French withdrawal had led some to speculate that Kapisa will become a security vacuum just outside Kabul. This would be no small matter: the &quot;ring of steel&quot; that surrounds Afghanistan&#x27;s capital has been broken so many times that few have faith in the capital&#x27;s safety anymore. Several of those early attacks, before the influx of French troops, were planned and supported out of the Tagab Valley. The French presence there had reduced the ability of militants in Kapisa to launch attacks into Kabul. When the French leave, the U.S. would not have the troops to fill in the gap, leaving a big opportunity for militants north of Kabul to strike back. Most of the province population believe that the long-term presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan can only serve to perpetuate the war cycle and the departure of the French will weaken the Taliban stance. Over 60 French soldiers have been killed in Kapisa since 2008, with hundreds more injured severely. With the help of Afghan National Army, French forces conducted operations to repel the insurgents and Afghan forces were able to gain a foothold in Kapisa valleys. They oversaw the formation of the 3rd Brigade of the 201st Afghan corps that is now deployed in Kapisa and of the Afghan police who now are solely responsible for providing the province&#x27;s security.

A transition ceremony for Kapisa Province was held July 4, 2012, formalizing the symbolic transfer of responsibility of the province from ISAF to Afghan authorities as part of the transition process in the province launched May 13, 2012; the Afghan security forces began to take the lead since autumn 2011. However the insurgency still remained active in Tagab and Alasay districts.

Some clashes have been reported in the province since the 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.

==Geography==

Kapisa province is located northeast of Kabul. It is bordered from the north by Panjshir Province, from the east by Laghman Province, from the south by Kabul province and from the south west by Parwan province. The province covers an area of ; that makes it the smallest province in all of Afghanistan. Kapisa Province&#x27;s terrain is a mixture of high peaks, mountainous river valleys, and shallow central plains; the highest points of the province are in the east, on the borders with Panjsher and Laghman Provinces.

==Politics and security==

The districts of Kohistan, Mahmud Raqi, and Kohband districts, all of which are Jamiat-i Islami and almost all Tajik, were targeted zones of interest for the insurgency. Because they are close enough to Kabul, the militants count attacks there as attacks in Kabul. Whilst the districts of Tagab, Alasay and Nijrab are Hizb-i Islami Gulbuddin supporters and are a mixture of Pashtuns, Tajiks and Pashai. The importance of Kapisa comes as it lies along the approach to the Panjshir River valley and most of the major Jamiat figures have managed to secure wealth and power in the post-2001 Afghanistan, while most of the HiG figures have not. As a result, most of the violence in the area is not actually &quot;Taliban&quot; as we would normally consider it, but HiG fighters (and in a lot of cases petty thugs) calling themselves Taliban.

In July 2007 Abdul Sattar Murad, was removed from office by President Hamid Karzai, and his replacement was Ghulam Qawis Abubaker. The ostensible reason for Murad&#x27;s removal was &#x27;ineffective governance&#x27;, but it was widely believed by press sources that Murad was removed because of critical comments he made in a Newsweek interview regarding the central government&#x27;s ineffectiveness in remote areas of the province.

Insurgent activity in the province increased in 2006 and 2007. Southern areas of the province, in particular the Tagab district, have been the site of repeated clashes between U.S. and Afghan forces and insurgent groups.

On January 19, 2009, coalition military forces led a raid near the village of Inzeri in the Tagab district of Kapisa. While coalition forces claimed at least 15 insurgents were killed (including a local Taliban commander), local villagers claimed that many of those killed were actually civilians. The raid was strongly criticized by Afghan president Hamid Karzai, who stated that such raids undermine the national government. The villagers were paid a total of $40,000 in condolence payments, and received an apology for any civilian deaths.

On 17 November 2009, Taliban insurgents fired rockets on a bazaar in Tagab district where French forces were meeting with tribal elders, killing 10 Afghan civilians and wounding 28.

Kapisa is seen as an important piece of property in the war against insurgency in the country, the province has been called &quot;the gateway to Kabul&quot;, it is viewed as an important area even as small as it is. A densely packed, multiethnic enclave in steep valleys surrounded by tall mountains. It has unique ethnicities like the Pashai and Parachi, unique Pashtuns like the Safi, and many Tajik dominated areas.

Kapisa has been the site of several failed attempts at counterinsurgency since 2005. There have been at least two special operations sweeps through the area, and at least three major Coalition efforts to clear and hold territory.
The province of Kapisa is an area that constitutes an invisible boundary between a zone to the west and north where the population is Tajik, and generally hostile to the Taliban, and the steep-sided valleys to the south-east dominated by the Pashtun and Pashai people, where there is a lot of rebel activity. This ethnic split lies at the heart of the Kapisa insurrection. Mahmud-i-Raqi, capital of Kapisa Province is Tajik dominated, where there are more fighters who fought with Massoud than there are Taliban sympathizers. Their staunch anti-Taliban stance is not the norm in this province – especially in the Tagab or Alasay districts. The Province a complex political and ethnic arena, where there is a lot of ambiguity towards foreign troops. Kapisa represents an allegory of the fractured and elusive Afghanistan.

===2010 Wolesi Jirga elections===
Kapisa is allocated four seats in the Wolesi Jirga, Afghanistan&#x27;s lower house of Parliament, one of which is reserved for female candidates. In the 2010 Wolesi Jirga contest 45,271 votes were cast in the province. Only one incumbent candidate, Mohammad Iqbal Safai was re-elected, coming in second place in the contest. Mirdad Khan Nijrabi came in first place in the contest, Agha Jan come in third, and Tahira Mujadidi, the winning female candidate, came in fourth.

==Economy==

Agriculture is the largest portion of the economy. One particular crop, saffron, has been introduced as a major trade commodity in the province.

Once a week, a trade day (called a &quot;Mela&quot;) occurs. The concept of the &quot;mela&quot; is ancient, and translates to &quot;party&quot; in Persian, as the event is as much a social event as a trade day.

Kapisa is primarily a farming province. Agriculture, livestock, and trade and services account for the majority of commercial activity. Agriculture is a significant source of income for 62% of households. However, commerce and services provide income to 32 percent of rural households, while non-farm-related labor provides income to 35 percent of rural households. Cotton, sesame, tobacco, confection, honey, karakul skin, and sugar sweets appear to be the most common industrial goods produced in this area.

Despite the fact that the number of villages engaged in handcraft production is more than five times that of villages engaged in industries, overall production remains low. Carpets, pottery, and jewelry are three handicrafts that stand out. In the province, 96% of households have access to irrigated land, while 7% of rural households have access to rain-fed land. Wheat, maize, and barley are the most important field crops. Poultry, cattle, oxen, sheep, and goats are the most frequent livestock.

==Sport==

The province is represented in Afghan domestic cricket tournaments by the Kapisa Province cricket team.

<doc id="457249" wikidata="Q185752" url="?curid=457249" title="Khost Province">
<text>Khost (Pashto/Dari: ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan located in the southeastern part of the country. Khost consists of thirteen districts and the city of Khost serves as the capital of the province. Historically, Khost used to be a part of Paktia and a larger region surrounding Khost is still referred to as Loya Paktia.

Throughout history, the province has been the site for numerous rebellions, leading to the local Pashtun populace to consider themselves the “traditional king-makers in Kabul”. The province was previously known as the Southern province and was united with the neighbouring Paktia province. Khost is also home to numerous universities, including Shaikh Zayed University, which is the only university in Afghanistan with a faculty in computer science.

As of 2021, it was estimated that the population of the province stood at 647,730, which makes it the 16th most populated province in Afghanistan.

Khost International Airport began providing the province with international flights after it was inaugurated by the former president Ashraf Ghani on July 10, 2021.

To the east, Khost Province is bordered by the North Waziristan and Kurram districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. To the north, it is bordered by the Nangarhar. To the south, it is bordered by Paktika. To the west, it is bordered by Paktia.

==History==
=== Second Anglo-Afghan War ===

During the second Anglo-Afghan War, British forces led by Lord Roberts entered the province. Approximately 8,000 raiders from the Mangal tribe, which had a long tradition of resisting outside control, launched several attacks on weakly protected British supply convoys in Khost Province. In reprisal, Lord Roberts ordered his forces to attack eleven Mangal villages which had launched raids that murdered several camp followers, resulting in them being sacked and burnt. As the news of the reprisals spread over Britain, his political opponents in the British parliament criticized Lord Robert&#x27;s actions. At the end of the conflict, British forces withdrew from the province.

=== Khost rebellion (1924–1925) ===
 In 1924, the province of Khost, then known as the Southern province, was the site of a rebellion against Emir Amanullah Khan by the Mangal tribe. The rebellion began in March 1924 when Mulla Abd Allah accused a local official of violating Sharia by forbidding a marriage in accordance with a new family law as the father of the bride in question had pledged her to another man whilst she was an infant. As a result, Mulla Abd Allah issued a fatwa against Amanullah Khan, condemning him as a kafir(infidel) and launching Jihad after a failed attempt was made by mediators to justify the new laws. The rebels were soon joined by the son of the former king Yaqub Khan, Abd-al Karim, who managed to escape British surveillance and moved to Khost, where he was crowned king by the rebels. Rebel forces then conquered the city of Gardez, which is adjacent to Khost. By late July, the rebels had captured Hisarak, which was 12 kilometres far from the capital, Kabul. However, the rebels didn’t try to seize the capital and instead returned to Khost, taking the spoils of war with them.

The Deobandi-trained council of ’ulama’ issued a fatwa denouncing Mulla Abd Allah as a rebel and began to provide Amanullah Khan with levies after he allowed them to alter the constitution so that it would align with their interpretation of Sharia. In August, Shah Wali Khan attacked the rebels in Logar whilst the Afghan Air Force were simultaneously bombing rebel positions. By early October, government forces had regained possession of the city of Gardez. Two months later, tribal leaders from Khost travelled to Kabul with the aim of initiating a peace process, only to be thrown in jail. Mulla Abd Allah, along with his three sons, were eventually captured and executed, and the rebellion was quelled in January 1925. Shah Wali Khan burned and looted more than 300 homes in Khost and brought 600 female captives back with him to Kabul, where they were distributed amongst the Mohammadzais as war booty. In the aftermath of the government’s victory, Amanullah Khan decided to construct a victory pillar in Kabul to commemorate his vanquishing of the rebels. The new pillar was meant to demonstrate the “triumph of knowledge over ignorance”.
=== Soviet–Afghan War ===

In April 1978, the Communist People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan staged a coup d&#x27;état against the then president Mohammed Daoud Khan, ending the Republic of Afghanistan and establishing the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan under the rule of Nur Muhammad Taraki, who would later be overthrown and killed by Hafizullah Amin in 1979. The coup is also known as the Saur Revolution. In late 1978, a rebellion occurred in the remote region of Nuristan, but it didn&#x27;t spread to the other parts of the country due to its isolation. The new communist government strived to eliminate illiteracy and implement agrarian reforms by sending literacy campaigners and agrarian reformers to various provinces, including Khost. Following a rebellion by the Zadran tribe, a Pashtun tribe native to Loya Paktia, president Hafizullah Amin decided to launch a full scale military operation in Paktia. The operation was a &quot;crushing defeat&quot; and it, alongside the ousting of former President Taraki, was one of the reasons why the Soviets decided to intervene in December 1979, thus starting the Soviet–Afghan War.
At the end of July 1983, the forces of Jalaluddin Haqqani laid siege to two towns in Khost and the Tani, Mangal, Zazai and Waziri tribes began taking an active part in the fighting, despite being passive up until then. All of the aforementioned events coincided with the appeal of former King Mohammed Zahir Shah for a united front, which caused rumours about the Royalists intending to establish a provisional government in a liberated Khost. However, Khost wasn&#x27;t captured and by October, the Tani tribe had withdrawn from coalition due to a tribal rivalry with the Zadran. Many rebels also returned home as winter came on. By the end of December, government forces arriving from Gardez ended the siege of the two towns and recaputered Zazi Maidan.

Khost was considered a &quot;bastion of the regime&quot; during the Soviet–Afghan War and its loyalty to the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan allowed it to be granted a de facto provincial status in 1986. This provided the province with a force of paid provincial staff and an annual budget that was separate from the neighbouring provinces.

===1993-present===
Khost Province saw the Battles of Zhawar and part of Operation Infinite Reach. Khost Province was captured by the Taliban during the 2021 Taliban offensive on August 15, 2021.

On 16 April 2022, Pakistani airstrikes targeted several villages in Spera District, including Afghan-Dubai, Pasa Mela, Mir Sapar, Mandata, and Kanai, and struck refugee camps belonging to internally displaced persons from Waziristan, killing at least 41 people, mainly women and children, and wounding 22 others.

On 22 June 2022, a magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck the province. In Spera District, approximately 500 homes were destroyed, and 40 people were killed, with 95 others injured. Many houses constructed primarily of mud and wood were razed to the ground. Heavy rain and the earthquake contributed to landslides that destroyed entire hamlets.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 34% in 2005 to 35% in 2011. 
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 18% in 2005 to 32% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 28% in 2005 to 15% in 2011. 
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 38% in 2005 to 37% in 2011. 

===Universities===
There are multiple universities in Khost, the following list consists of all of the universities that can be found in the province: 

*Shaikh Zayed University - Initially opened in Peshawar, Pakistan in 2000, the university was moved to Khost on orders of the former president Hamid Karzai. The university bears the name of the first president of the United Arab Emirates, Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who sponsored the construction of its campus in Khost.
*Pamir University - Situated in the capital of Khost province, the university is a private higher education institute which was inaugurated on April 24, 2011.
*Hara University - Private university that’s also situated in the city of Khost.

== Demographics ==
As of 2021, the population of the province is around 950,000 people. Other sources put the number at over a million.

The Pashtun people make up 99% of the population, with the remaining 1% being Tajiks and others.

Districts of Khost:


==Water==
Khost Province is traversed by the Kurram River, which rises from the Rokian Defile, passes through the district, and then enters the &quot;country of the Turis or the Kurram Valley&quot;.

<doc id="457257" wikidata="Q185442" url="?curid=457257" title="Laghman Province">
<text>Laghman (Persian/Pashto: ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country. It has a population of about 502,148, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a rural society. Laghman hosts a large number of historical landmarks, minarets, monuments, and other cultural relics that are manifestation of its old history and culture. The city of Mihtarlam serves as the capital of the province. In some historical texts the name is written as &quot;Lamghan&quot; or as &quot;Lamghanat&quot;.

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

== Etymology ==
Laghman or Lamghan is originally named after Lamech (Mether Lam Baba), the father of Noah.

==History==
Located currently at the Kabul Museum are Aramaic inscriptions that were found in Laghman which indicated an ancient trade route from India to Palmyra. Aramaic was the bureaucratic script language of the Achaemenids whose influence had extended toward Laghman. During the invasions of Alexander the Great, the area was known as Lampaka.

Inscriptions in Aramaic dating from the Mauryan Dynasty were found in Laghman which discussed the conversion of Ashoka to Buddhism. The inscription mentions that the distance to Palmyra is 300 dhanusha or yojana.

The Mahamayuri Tantra dated to between the 1-3rd century mentions several popular Yaksha shrines. It mentions Yaksha Kalahapriya being worshipped in Lampaka.

In the seventh century, the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited Laghman, which he called &quot;Lan-pro&quot; and considered part of India. He indicated the presence of Mahayana Buddhists and numerous Hindus, including Brahmins:

The Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam which was finished in 982 AD mentioned the presence of some idol worshipping temples in the area, and describes the province as an emporium of Hindūstān.

The Kabul Shahis only retained Lamghan in the Kabul-Gandhara area by the time of Alp-tegin. According to Firishta, Sabuktigin had already begun raiding Lamghan under Alp-begin. He crossed the Khyber Pass many times and raided the territory of Jayapala. He plundered the forts in the outlying provinces of the Kabul Shahi and captured many cities, acquiring huge booty. He also established Islam at many places. Jaipal in retaliation marched with a large force into the valley of Lamghan (Jalalabad) where he clashed with Sabuktigin and his son. The battle stretched on several days until a snowstorm affected Jaipala&#x27;s strategies, forcing him to sue for peace.

Jayapala then returned to Waihind but broke the treaty and mistreated the amirs sent to collect the tribute. Sabuktigin launched another invasion in retaliation. According to al-Utbi, Sabuktigin attacked Lamghan, conquering it and burning the residences of the &quot;infidels&quot; while also demolishing its idol-temples and establishing Islam. He advanced and butchered the idolaters, destroying the temples and plundering their shrines, even risking frostbite on their hands counting the large booty.

To avenge the savage attack of Sabuktigin, Jayapala, who has earlier taken his envoys as hostage, decided to go to war again in revenge. The forces of Kabul Shahi were however routed and those still alive were killed in the forest or drowned in the river. The second battle that took place between Sabuktigin and Jayapala in 988 A.D., resulted in the former capturing territory between Lamghan and Peshawar. Al-Ubti also states that the Afghans and Khaljis, living there as nomads, took the oath of allegiance to him and were recruited into his army. Sabuktigin won one of his greatest battles in Laghman against Jayapala and his army numbering 100,000. Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni built the Tomb of Lamech, amid gardens, over the site of his presumed grave, 50 kilometres from Mihtarlam.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, Khārkhay Pashtuns such as Yusupzai and Tarkāṇī invaded the Laghmān valley and displaced the native Indo-Aryans.

During the early years of the 16th century, the Mughal ruler Babur spent much time in Laghman, and in &quot;Baburnama&quot; (memoirs of Babur) he expatiated on the beauty of forested hillsides and the fertility of the valley bottoms of the region. Laghman was recognized as a dependent district of Kabulistan in the Mughal era, and according to Baburnama, &quot;Greater Lamghanat&quot; included the Muslim-settled part of the Kafiristan, including the easterly one of Kunar River. Laghman was the base for expeditions against the non-believers and was frequently mentioned in accounts of jihads led by Mughal emperor Akbar&#x27;s younger brother, Mohammad Hakim, who was the governor of Kabul. In 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani defeated the Mughals and made the territory part of the Durrani Empire. In the late nineteenth century, Amir Abdur Rahman Khan forced the remaining kafirs (Nuristani people) to convert to Islam.

<text>Logar (Pashto/Dari: لوگر) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern section of the country. It is divided into 7 districts and contains hundreds of villages. Puli Alam is the capital of the province. As of 2021, Logar has a population of approximately 442,037 people, most of whom are ethnic Pashtuns and Tajiks.

The Logar River enters the province through the west and leaves to the north.

== History ==

A 2,600-year-old Zoroastrian fire temple was found at Mes Aynak (about 25 miles or 40  kilometers southeast of Kabul). Several Buddhist stupas and more than 1,000 statues were also found. Smelting workshops, miners’ quarters (even then the site&#x27;s copper was well known), a mint, two small forts, a citadel, and a stockpile of Kushan, Sassanian and Indo-Parthian coins were also found at the site.

=== Recent history ===
During the Soviet–Afghan War, Logar was known among some Afghans as the Bab al-Jihad (Gates of Jihad) because it became a fierce theatre of war between US-backed/trained mujahideen groups and the Soviet-backed Afghan government troops. The Ahmadzai Pashtuns is dominant in this region. Haji Shuja, Haji Zareen and Haji Bahadur were the prominent traders and chieftains in the region before the soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It was one of the main supply routes of mujahideen rebels coming from Pakistan. Like other parts of the country, Logar has also seen heavy fighting since the Soviets started a crackdown against the elders of the Ahmadzai tribe during the 1980s. Swedish journalist Borge Almqvist, who visited the province in 1982, wrote that: &quot;Everywhere in the Logar province the most common sight except for ruins are graves&quot;. Soviet operations included using bombing, the use of flammable liquids to burn alive people in hiding, poisoning of drinking water, and destruction of crops and farmland. One writer who witnessed the events argues that the Soviet actions in Logar amounted to genocide.

By 1995, the province had fallen to the Taliban government. During the presidency of Hamid Karzai, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) gradually took over the security of the area. The Provincial Reconstruction Team Logar (PRT Logar) was established in March 2008. It provided several benefits to the locals, including security, development, and jobs.

On 19 August 2014, a major Taliban offensive took place with 700 insurgents aiming to take control of the province, while the NATO-led foreign force mistakenly killed three civilians in an airstrike in December 2014.

On 20 January 2019, the Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack on the province&#x27;s governor and his convoy, which killed eight security forces and wounded at least 10 on the highway to Kabul. The governor and the provincial head of the National Directorate of Security were uninjured.

On 14 August 2021, the Taliban offensive reached Puli Alam (the province capital), and the province of Logar fell to the Taliban, setting their sights on Kabul the following day.

== Geography ==

Logar can be generally described as a relatively flat river valley in the north and central regions, surrounded by rugged mountains to the east, south, and southwest. The district of Azra, in the east, consists almost entirely of mountains, while travel to the Paktia Province to the south is limited to the Tera Pass, a 2896 m high road that was recently completed as part of the international reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. The Kabul-Khost Highway runs north–south through Logar Province, from the Mohammed Agha District.

The government of Afghanistan officially recognizes all the districts of the Logar province as part of the province.

=== Capital city===
Puli Alam, which is located in the district of Puli Alam, serves as the capital of Logar province. It is connected by a highway to Kabul in the north and Gardez to the southeast.

The highway to Kabul was completed in 2006. Additional projects include numerous schools, radio stations, government facilities, and a major Afghan National Police base situated south of the city.

Like many Afghan cities, there is municipal planning and services.
During the tenure of President Ashraf Ghani the city gained electricity, clean drinking and water facilities.

== Economy ==

Tobacco and sugar extract are the two most important industrial crops. The main industry is honey production, which is a small industry. Jewelry, ceramics, and carpets are made in a small number of settlements. Eighty-four percent of the province&#x27;s households have access to irrigated land. Wheat, maize, potatoes, alfalfa, clover, and other feed are among the most significant field crops. Sheep, cattle, camels, and poultry are the most frequent livestock.

There are several girls schools in the province, mostly located in Koshi and Pul-e-alam.

<doc id="457263" wikidata="Q178471" url="?curid=457263" title="Nangarhar Province">
<text>Nangarhār (Pashto: ; Dari: ), also called Nangrahar or Ningrahar, is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country and bordering Logar, Kabul, Laghman and Kunar provinces as well as having an international border with Pakistan. It is divided into 22 districts and has a population of about 1,735,531, the third highest of the country&#x27;s 34 provinces. The city of Jalalabad is the capital of Nangarhar province. Nangarhar province is famous for its fish and karahi dishes.

==Etymology==
Henry George Raverty theorized that the word Nangarhar is derived from the Pashto term &quot;nang-nahar&quot; (&quot;nine streams&quot;), which appears in some Persian chronicles. The term supposedly refers to nine streams originating from Safed Koh. However, according to S. H. Hodivala, the name of the province derives from the Sanskrit term Nagarahara, which appears in a 9th-century inscription discovered at Ghosrawa in present-day Bihar, India. &quot;Nà-jiā-luó-ā&quot;, the Chinese transcription of Nagarahara, appears in the annals of the Song dynasty of China. Henry Walter Bellew derived the name from the Sanskrit &quot;nava-vihara&quot;, meaning &quot;nine viharas&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
The province was originally part of the Achaemenid Empire, in the Gandhara satrapy (province). The people in the area were originally Hindus and Buddhists. The Nangarhar province territory and the Eastern Iranian peoples there fell to the Maurya Empire, which was led by Chandragupta Maurya. Seleucus is said to have reached a peace treaty with Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants.

Song Yun, a Chinese monk who visited Nangarhar in 520 AD, claimed that the people in the area were Buddhists. Yun came across a vihara (monastery) in Nangarhar (Na-lka-lo-hu) containing the skull of Buddha, and another of Kekalam (probably Mihtarlam in Laghman province) where 13 pieces of the cloak of Buddha and his 18 feet long mast were preserved. In the city of Naki, a tooth and hair of Buddha were preserved and in the Kupala cave The Buddha&#x27;s shadow reflected close to which he saw a stone tablet which was at that time considered to be related to Buddha (probably the stone tablet of Ashoka in Darūntah).

The region fell to the Ghaznavids after defeating Jayapala in the late 10th century. It later fell to the Ghorids followed by the Khaljis, Lodhis and the Moghuals, until finally becoming part of Ahmad Shah Durrani&#x27;s Afghan Empire in 1747.

During the First Anglo-Afghan War, the invading British-led Indian forces were defeated on their way to Rawalpindi in 1842. British-led Indian forces returned in 1878 but retreated a couple of years later. Some fighting took place during the 1919 Third Anglo-Afghan War between the Afghan army that were led by King Amanullah Khan and British-Indians near the Durand Line border areas.

The province remained relatively calm until the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War. Nangarhar was used by pro-Pakistani mujahideen (rebel forces) fighting against the Soviet-backed Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Pakistani-trained mujahideen received funding from the United States and Saudi Arabia. Many Arab fighters from the Arab World had been fighting against the government forces of Mohammad Najibullah, who ultimately defeated them near Jalalabad. In April 1992, Najibullah resigned as President and the various mujahideen took control over the country. When the 1992 Peshawar Accord failed, the mujahideen turned guns on each other and started a nationwide civil war. This was followed by the Taliban take-over in 1996 and the establishment of al-Qaeda training camps in Nangarhar province.

===Recent history===


Osama bin Laden held a strong position in Nangarhar during the late 1990s. He led a fight against US-led forces in the 2001 Tora Bora campaign. He ultimately escaped to Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he was killed in a night raid by members of SEAL Team Six in 2011.

After the removal of the Taliban government and the formation of the Karzai administration in late 2001, U.S.-led Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) gradually established authority across the province. Despite this, Taliban insurgents continue to stage attacks against Afghan government forces. The Haqqani Network and militants loyal to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-KP) are often blamed for the attacks, which sometimes include major suicide bombings. Several incursions by Pakistani military forces have also been reported in the districts next to the Durand Line border. The focus of the conflict is on the Kabul and Kunar rivers, which run through Nangarhar.

On 13 April 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a targeted strike on ISIL-KP by use of the second largest non-nuclear bomb in the U.S. arsenal at the time. The bomb was a 21,000 lb. weapon called the Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb; nicknamed the &quot;Mother Of All Bombs&quot; (MOAB). The intended target was ISIL militants hiding inside tunnels, most of whom came &quot;from Bangladesh, Russia, India and other countries.&quot; It was the first time the MOAB had been used in combat. In August 2021, the province was captured by the Taliban.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 43% in 2005 to 8% in 2011. The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 22% in 2005 to 60% in 2011.

==Education==

Nangarhar University is located in the provincial capital, Jalalabad. It is government-funded and provides higher education to nearly 6,000 students from the region.

A number of schools operate in the province, providing basic education to both boys and girls. The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 29% in 2005 to 31% in 2011. The overall net enrollment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 39% in 2005 to 51% in 2011.

==Economy==
The Jalalabad plain is one of the principal agricultural areas of Afghanistan. The strong agricultural base, coupled with the crucial trade route connecting Kabul with Peshawar, makes Nangarhar one of the more economically diverse and functional provinces of Afghanistan. Torkham is one of the major border crossings between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is the busiest port of entry between the two countries, serving as a major economical hub for the province.

Nangarhar is famous in Afghanistan for producing lemons, oranges, olives, peanuts and dates. Many other fruits and vegetables are also grown. It was once a major center of opium poppy production in the country.

==Transportation==

The Jalalabad Airport is located next to the city of Jalalabad. It serves the populations of Nangarhar, Kunar, Nuristan, and other nearby provinces.

The Kabul–Jalalabad Road runs throughout the province, linking Kabul with Jalalabad and extending east through Khyber Pass to Peshawar. It is one of the busiest major roads in Afghanistan.

==Geography==

==Demographics==


As of 2021, the population of the province is around 1,735,531. Over 90% of the population is Pashtun and the remaining is made up of Pashais, Tajiks, Arabs, and other ethnic groups. The 18th edition Ethnologue states on p. 48 that Nangarhar is the center of the (smaller) Northern Pashto language in Afghanistan. Only one in five Afghan Pashtuns use the Northern variety.

===Districts===
Nangarhar is divided into 22 districts. They are as follows:


==Sports==

Jalalabad is considered the capital of Afghan cricket with many of the national players coming from the surrounding areas.

<text>Travis Mayweather is a fictional character, portrayed by Anthony Montgomery, in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, serving as a navigator and helm officer aboard the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He holds the rank of ensign, and is in the command division. Mayweather is one of the main characters throughout the show&#x27;s entire four-season run.

==Character overview==

===Television series===
Mayweather was born in 2126 aboard the ECS &quot;Horizon&quot;, a human J-class cargo ship, and has visited the fictional planets Trillius Prime, Draylax, Vega Colony, and both Tenebian moons. He is a &quot;boomer&quot;, meaning he grew up aboard cargo ships, and that he has more experience in space than even his commanding officer, Captain Jonathan Archer.

Mayweather is a quiet and enthusiastic young man who is a highly skilled pilot and has some spelunking experience. He has at least one brother, Paul, who became the captain of the &quot;Horizon&quot; after the death of their father, the ship&#x27;s previous captain, in January 2153. Their mother, Rianna, was the ship&#x27;s medic and chief engineer. There is also mention that Mayweather has a sister who is married, but has never been seen. While heading to Deneva Station, the &quot;Horizon&quot; is being attacked by pirates but Mayweather&#x27;s experience with weapons from Starfleet allows the &quot;Horizon&quot; to defend herself.

Over the course of the series, Mayweather gets injured, incapacitated, or even getting &quot;killed&quot; more times than any other character in the primary cast.

When &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; is conceived for the first time, Mayweather is intended to be a lieutenant but his rank gets changed to Ensign because the producers feel that having Mayweather and the older Malcolm Reed at a similar rank won&#x27;t be believable.

===Novels===
In the novel &quot;Rise of the Federation: A Choice of Futures&quot;, Mayweather is promoted to first officer of USS &quot;Pioneer&quot; under Captain Malcolm Reed.

=== Costumes ===
There were five uniforms made for this character over the show&#x27;s run, and they were later auctioned off. Examples of this include; the MACO uniform and a Red-shirt Mirror Universe costume for the episode &quot;In A Mirror Darkly&quot;.

==Mirror Universe==
In the two-part episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, the Mirror Universe version of Travis Mayweather is a sergeant in the MACO corps. He eventually allies himself with the Mirror Hoshi Sato in her attempt to take over the Terran Empire.

==Actor commentary and episodes==
In an interview conducted towards the end of the first season, Anthony Montgomery suggested that it would be good to see Travis Mayweather&#x27;s parents make an appearance on the show. Montgomery was pleased when this came true in &quot;Horizon&quot;, saying, &quot;It was really a touching episode for me, you got a feel of how hard it was for Travis to leave the family and join Starfleet.&quot;

==Reception==
According to author David Greven, &quot;Ensign Travis Mayweather, the helmsman, is African American and a complete blank, rarely is given even one non-technobabble line an episode; without the slightest exaggeration, it is entirely accurate to say that Nichelle Nichols&#x27; Uhura on Original &quot;Trek&quot; had more lines of dialog.&quot; In 2016, Travis was ranked as the 33rd most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired magazine, out of 100 characters.

&quot;Nerd Infinite&quot; thought Mayweather was an interesting character due to growing up in space, but would have liked more stories about him.

<doc id="457266" wikidata="Q183021" url="?curid=457266" title="Nimruz Province">
<text>Nimruz or Nimroz (Balochi: ; Dari, Pashto: ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the southwestern part of the country. It lies to the east of the Sistan and Baluchestan province of Iran and north of Balochistan, Pakistan, also bordering the Afghan provinces of Farah and Helmand. It has a population of about 186,963 people. The province is divided into five districts, encompassing about 649 villages.

The city of Zaranj serves as the provincial capital and Zaranj Airport, which is located in that city, serves as a domestic airport for the province. The recently-built Kamal Khan Dam is located in Chahar Burjak District.

The name &quot;Nimruz&quot; means &quot;mid-day&quot; or &quot;half-day&quot; in Persian Language and Balochi. The name is believed to indicate that the meridian cutting the old world in half passes through this region. Nimruz covers 43,000 km2. It is the most sparsely populated province in the country, located in the Sistan Basin. A substantial part of the province is the barren desert area of Dasht-e Margo.

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

==History==

The name Zaranj was derived from Persian word &quot;Zranka&quot; and is considered to be one of the oldest cities in Nimruz Province. The area now composing Nimruz province of Afghanistan was once part of the historical region of Sistan, which over the many centuries was held by the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander the Great and others before being conquered and converted to Islam by the Muslim Arabs in the seventh century. The region became part of the Saffarid dynasty in 860 CE with its capital at Zaranj, which was one of the first local dynasties of the Islamic era. Its founder Yaqub Saffari was born and raised in this region. The territory became part of the Ghaznavids followed by the Ghurids, Timurids, and Safavids.

In the early 18th century, the region fell to the Afghan Hotaki dynasty until they were removed from power in 1738 by Nader Shah. By 1747, Ahmad Shah Durrani made it part of Afghanistan after he conquered the territory from northeastern Iran to Delhi in India. Under the modern Afghan government, the province was known as Chakhansur Province until 1968, when it was separated to form the provinces of Nimruz and Farah. The city of Zaranj became the capital of Nimroz province at that time. During the Soviet–Afghan War, Nimruz province was used by mujahideen crossing back and forth between Afghanistan and neighboring countries. It was also used by Afghan refugees escaping the war as well as by smugglers.

As the Taliban came to power in 1995, they seized the road-controlling town of Delaram (now within Farah Province), and came to an agreement with local mujahideen commanders that the fate of the province would not be decided until a clear victor emerged in the capture of Kabul. However, the Taliban advanced on Nimruz only days later, and the mujahideen under command of Abdul Karim Brahui fled to Iran.

=== 21st century ===

==== 2000s ====

Following the US-led invasion in October 2001, the Taliban began losing control of the province to the new Afghan government under President Hamid Karzai. The area is historically known for drugs and weapons smuggling between Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan. Many foreign militants also use the province to go back and forth between the 3 nations. The Delaram–Zaranj Highway was built by the Indian government in 2009, which is one of the main trade routes in the country and is expected to boost the socio-economic development in the province.

Since 2002, members of the U.S. Marine Corps were present in the province. When the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) arrived at Kandahar, Nimruz province became part of the Regional Command Southwest. The local Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) were being trained by these forces. ISAF was also involved in development activities.

==== 2020s ====
In 2021, American forces withdrew from Afghanistan. On August 6, 2021, the Taliban overran Nimruz, when the Afghan government forces in the city of Zaranj, the 215th Corps, fled. There had been a lack of reinforcements from the government. The fleeing allowed the Taliban to take the city, including the government forces&#x27; &quot;military bases and intelligence offices&quot;. The government forces then crossed over into Iran. The Taliban let the city&#x27;s prisoners go free, but the most &quot;notorious inmates&quot; were already transferred to Kabul. The Taliban had been using prison breaks to degrade the security forces&#x27; morale and grow their own ranks. The takeover meant that Ashraf Ghani&#x27;s government could no longer get revenue from the region&#x27;s border crossings with Iran.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water fell from 38% in 2005 to 24% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 7% in 2005 to 28% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 22% in 2005 to 23% in 2011. 
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 33% in 2005 to 49% in 2011.

==Transport and economy==
As of June 2014 Zaranj Airport which is located near the city of Zaranj had regularly scheduled flights to Herat.

The Delaram–Zaranj Highway has been constructed by India via Chaknasur, which is expected to boost the socio economic development in the region.

Trade, farming, and herding is the main source of income for the majority. This includes agriculture and animal husbandry. Animals include sheep, goat, cattle, and poultry. The province produces the following: Wheat, corn, melons, poppies; almost all irrigated.

Nimruz has always been isolated the past. This led to one author in 2010 calling it Afghanistan&#x27;s &quot;forgotten province.&quot; Historically, the territory served as a major smuggling hub due to its border with Iran and Pakistan. The province became popular after the trade route between Iran and Afghanistan became operational, which provides another large income to the Afghan government.

==Geography==
The Sistan Basin dominates the province. Many parts of the south are covered by the Godzareh Depression which includes marshes and dry lakes.

== Demography ==
The NSIA puts the population of Nimruz Province at approximately 186,963 people. This estimate includes the many Kuchi nomads who inhabit the province seasonally and the native settled people. It is the only province of Afghanistan where the Baloch ethnic group forms a majority. The Balochs are followed by Pashtun, Brahui, Tajik, Uzbek, and Hazara. The Pashtun tribes are mostly Barakzai and Nurzai. Almost all inhabitants except the Shia Hazaras follow Sunni Islam. Languages spoken in the province are Balochi, Pashto and Dari.

<doc id="457267" wikidata="Q167485" url="?curid=457267" title="Nuristan Province">
<text>Nuristan, also spelled as Nurestan or Nooristan (Pashto: ; Kamkata-vari: ), is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country. It is divided into seven districts and is Afghanistan&#x27;s least populous province, with a population of around 167,000. Parun serves as the provincial capital. Nuristan is bordered on the south by Laghman and Kunar provinces, on the north by Badakhshan province, on the west by Panjshir province, and on the east by Pakistan.

The origin of the local Nuristani people has been disputed, ranging from being the indigenous inhabitants forced to flee to this region after refusing to surrender to invaders, to being linked to various ancient groups of people and the Turk Shahi kings. Some Nuristanis claim being descendants of the Greek occupying forces of Alexander the Great. It was formerly called Kafiristan () (&quot;Land of the Infidels&quot;) until the inhabitants were forcibly converted from an animist religion with elements from Indo-Iranian (Vedic- or Hindu-like) religion infused with local variations, to Islam in 1895, and thence the region has become known as Nuristan (&quot;land of illumination&quot;, or &quot;land of light&quot;). The region was located in an area surrounded by Buddhist and Hindu civilizations which were later taken over by Muslims.

The primary occupations are agriculture, animal husbandry, and day labor. Located on the southern slopes of the Hindu Kush mountains in the northeastern part of the country, Nuristan spans the basins of the Alingar, Pech, Landai Sin, and Kunar rivers. Most of Nuristan is covered by mountainous forests and it has a rich biodiversity with a domestically unique monsoon climate by air coming from the Indian Ocean. As of 2020, the entirety of Nuristan is now a protected national park.

==History==

===Early history===
The surrounding area fell to Alexander the Great in 330 BC. It later fell to Chandragupta Maurya. The Mauryas introduced Buddhism to the region, and were attempting to expand their empire to Central Asia until they faced local Greco-Bactrian forces. Seleucus is said to have reached a peace treaty with Chandragupta by giving control of the territory south of the Hindu Kush to the Mauryas upon intermarriage and 500 elephants.

Before their conversion to Islam, the Nuristanis practiced an animist religion with elements from Indo-Iranian (Vedic- or Hindu-like) religion infused with locally developed accretions. They were called &quot;kafirs&quot; due to their enduring paganism while other regions around them became Muslim. However, the influence from district names in Kafiristan of Katwar or Kator and the ethnic name Kati has also been suggested.

The area extending from modern Nuristan to Kashmir was known as &quot;Puritan&quot;, a vast area containing a host of &quot;Kafir&quot; cultures and Indo-European languages that became Islamized over a long period. Earlier, it was surrounded by Buddhist areas. The Islamization of the nearby Badakhshan began in the 8th century and Peristan was surrounded by Muslim states in the 16th century with the Islamization of Baltistan. The Buddhist states temporarily brought literacy and state rule into the region. The decline of Buddhism resulted in it becoming heavily isolated.

There have been varying theories about the origins of Kafirs including the Arab tribe of Quraish, or Gabars of Persia, the Greek soldiers of Alexander as well as the Indians of eastern Afghanistan. George Scott Robertson considered them to be part of the old Indian population of Eastern Afghanistan and stated they fled to the mountains after the Muslim invasion in the 10th century. He added they probably found other races there whom they killed off and enslaved or amalgamated with them.

Oral traditions of some of the Nuristanis place themselves to be at the confluence of Kabul River and Kunar River a millennium ago. These traditions state they were driven off from Kandahar to Kabul to Kapisa to Kama with the Muslim invasion. They identify themselves as late arrivals in Nuristan, being driven by Mahmud of Ghazni who after establishing his empire forced the unsubmissive population to flee.

The name Kator was used by Lagaturman, last king of the Turk Shahi. Apparently due to its usage by the last Turk-Shahi ruler, it was adopted as a title by the ruler of the north-west region of the Indian subcontinent, comprising Chitral and Kafiristan. The title &quot;Shah Kator&quot; was assumed by Chitral&#x27;s ruler Mohtaram Shah who assumed it upon being impressed by the majesty of the erstwhile pagan rulers of Chitral. The theory of Kators being related to Turki Shahis is based on the information of &quot;Jami- ut-Tawarikh&quot; and &quot;Tarikh-i-Binakiti&quot;. The region was also named after its ruling elite. The royal usage may be the origin behind the name of Kator.

The high god of the pre-Islamic Nuristani religion was the god &quot;Imra&quot;, derived from the Hindu god Yama, and was also called &quot;Mara&quot;. Another god was Indr, derived from Indra. He was seen as the brother of the god Gisht and father of Pano and the goddess Dishani. There were also many other minor gods worshiped in the region.

The region was invaded by forces of Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman Khan in 1896 and most of the people were converted either by force or did so to avoid the &quot;jizya&quot;:

The region was renamed Nuristan, meaning &quot;Land of the enlightened&quot;, a reflection of the &quot;enlightening&quot; of the pagan Nuristani by the &quot;light-giving&quot; of Islam.

Nuristan was once thought to have been a region through which Alexander the Great passed with a detachment of his army; thus the folk legend that the Nuristani people are descendants of Alexander (or &quot;his generals&quot;).

In the 19th century, the Emirate of Afghanistan incorporated Nuristan into its territory via military conquest; this occurred around the same time as the beginning of European influence in Afghanistan. During this period, one of the most well known Afghan generals from this period, Abdul Wakil Khan, was born in Nuristan. He fought against the insurgent forces of Habibullāh Kalakāni and was buried on the same plateau where Afghan king Amanullah Khan is buried.

===Recent history===

Since the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Afghan politicians (particularly Mohammed Daoud Khan) have been focused on re-annexing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of what is now Pakistan. This has led to militancy on both sides of the Durand Line.

Nuristan was the scene of some of the heaviest guerrilla fighting during the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War. The province was influenced by Mawlawi Afzal&#x27;s Islamic Revolutionary State of Afghanistan, which was supported by Pakistan nationalists and Saudi Arabia. It dissolved under the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban rule) in the late 1990s.

Nuristan is one of the poorest and most remote provinces of Afghanistan. Prior to the takeover of the Taliban in 2021, few NGOs operated in Nuristan because of the insurgency and a lack of safe roads. Some road construction projects were launched linking Nangarej to Mandol and Chapa Dara to Titan Dara. The Afghan government also worked on a direct road route to Laghman province, in order to reduce dependence on the road through restive Kunar province to the rest of Afghanistan. Other road projects were started aimed at improving the primitive road from Kamdesh to Barg-i Matal, and from Nangalam in Kunar province to the provincial center at Parun.

Since Nuristan is a highly ethnically homogeneous province, there are few incidents of inter-ethnic violence. However, there are instances of disputes among inhabitants, some of which continue for decades. Nuristan has suffered from its inaccessibility and lack of infrastructure. The government presence is under-developed, even compared to neighboring provinces. Nuristan&#x27;s formal educational sector is weak, with few professional teachers. Due to its proximity to Pakistan, many of the inhabitants are actively involved in trade and commerce across the border.

A map from the Afghan Ministry of the Interior produced in 2009 showed the western region of Nuristan to be under &quot;enemy control&quot;. There have been numerous conflicts between militants and U.S.-led Afghan security forces. In April 2008 members of the 3rd Special Forces Group led Afghan soldiers from the Commando Brigade into the Shok valley in an unsuccessful attempt to capture warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In July 2008, approximately 200 Taliban guerrillas attacked a NATO position just south of Nuristan, near the village of Wanat in the Waygal District, killing 9 U.S. soldiers.

In the following year, in early October, more than 350 insurgents backed by members of the Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin and other militia groups fought U.S.-led Afghan security forces in the Battle of Kamdesh at Camp Keating in Nuristan. The base was nearly overrun; more than 100 Taliban fighters, eight U.S. soldiers, and seven members of the Afghan security forces were killed during the fighting. Four days after the battle, in early October 2009, U.S. forces withdrew from their four main bases in Nuristan, as part of a plan by General Stanley McChrystal to pull troops out of small outposts and relocate them closer to major towns. The U.S. has pulled out from some areas in the past, but never from all four main bases. A month after the U.S. pullout the Taliban was governing openly in Nuristan. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Nuristan is &quot;a place so tough that NATO abandoned it in 2010 after failing to subdue it.&quot;

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

<text>Uruzgan (Pashto: ; Dari: ), also spelled as Urozgan or Oruzgan, is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan. Uruzgan is located in the center of the country. The population is 436,079, and the province is mostly a tribal society. Tarinkot serves as the capital of the province. Uruzgan borders the provinces of Kandahar, Daykundi, Ghazni, Zabul, and Helmand.

==Geography==

Uruzgan province is located in southern Afghanistan, bordering Zabul and Kandahar to the south, Helmand to the southwest, Daykundi to the north, and Ghazni to the east. Uruzgan covers an area of . Much of the province is mountainous or semi-mountainous terrain, while the rest of the area is made up of flat land.

==History==

The Arabs were first to arrive in Uruzgan in the 7th century when they brought Islam to the region followed by the Saffarids who conquered the place in the 9th century. The region was part of ancient Arachosia, and was ruled by the Medes before it fell to the Achaemenids. In 330 BC, Alexander the Great occupied the area but left it to the Seleucids to rule. It was later attained and ruled by the Mauryas under Ashoka. By the 7th century, when the Arabs first arrived, it was under the control of the Zunbils before being conquered in the name of Islam by the Saffarids in the 9th century. It fell to the Ghaznavids followed by the Ghurids before the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. The area was ruled by Arghun Khan of Ilkhanate, later by the Timurids, Mughals and Safavids.

During the 1980&#x27;s Soviet war in Afghanistan, Uruzgan witnessed fighting between pro-Soviet forces and the Mujahideen. One of the most prominent local Mujahideen leaders was Jan Mohammad Khan. In late 1994, Uruzgan was captured by the Taliban. They were toppled by US-led forces in late 2001. Hamid Karzai and his followers arrived in Uruzgan between October and November 2001 to take over control of the area. 

===Recent history===
In June 2002, a wedding party in Uruzgan was bombed by the U.S. Air Force, which resulted in the death of 30 civilians.

In 2004, the new Daykundi Province was carved out of an area of northern Uruzgan.

In August 2006, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) assumed authority for Uruzgan from the US-led coalition, as the Netherlands took command of the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) from the US as Task Force Uruzgan. There is also an Australian element under the Dutch command.
Because of security concerns and the Taliban insurgency, only one international aid agency (GIZ) has a permanent presence in Uruzgan. NATO&#x27;s ISAF operates a PRT in Tarinkot. The 1,400 Dutch and 1,090 Australian troops in the area secured only the largest population centers in Uruzgan (Deh Rawood, Chora, and Tarinkot towns) under the Dutch &quot;inkspot policy&quot;. However, the force&#x27;s area of responsibility included the entire province. Gizab district, which was then the most dangerous of Uruzgan&#x27;s district, had no ISAF presence before. In August 2010, the 1,950 Dutch forces withdrew their forces from Uruzgan province, after a political disagreement in the Dutch parliament, leaving the PRT to the US and Australia to continue the mission.
Uruzgan&#x27;s opium poppy crop reached record levels in 2006 and 2007, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), as no significant eradication efforts were carried out by the Afghan administration or Dutch forces.

Between 15 and 19 June 2007, Dutch, American, Australian and Afghan soldiers defended the town of Chora against an assault by Taliban combatants. Reports in the Dutch, Australian and US press indicated that the battle was one of the largest Taliban offensives of the year. The fighting resulted in the deaths of a Dutch soldier, 1 Australian soldier, 1 American soldier, 16 Afghan policemen, an unknown number of civilians and a large number of Taliban.

In September 2008, Rozi Khan, the leader of Uruzgan&#x27;s Pashtun Barakzai tribe, and a longtime rival of Popalzai leader Jan Mohammed Khan, was killed in a firefight in Chora District.

Gizab District was temporarily cleared of the Taliban by ISAF forces in late April 2010 and this was attributed to the uprising of the townspeople who helped the ISAF forces.

In February 2010, near Khod, over ten civilians in a three-vehicle convoy were killed by a combined force of a Lockheed AC-130, Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters and General Atomics MQ-1 Predator drones, who misidentified them as Taliban. The air forces were attempting to protect ground troops fighting several km away.

==Transportation==
As of May 2014, the province was served by Tarinkot Airport which had regularly scheduled direct passenger service to Kabul.

==Healthcare==
The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 8% in 2005 to 27% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 6% in 2005 to 14% in 2011.

==Education==
The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 5% in 2005 to 17% in 2011.
The overall net enrollment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 1% in 2005 to 49% in 2011.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the total population of the province is about 436,079. The province has an estimated 45,000 households, each with about six members on average. A large portion of Uruzgan&#x27;s population is ethnic Pashtun and ethnic Hazara. There is also a small population of the nomadic Kochis, whose numbers vary with the seasons.

Population figures are from the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, the Central Statistics Office Afghanistan, and the Liaison Office study 2009.

<doc id="457274" wikidata="Q182493" url="?curid=457274" title="Paktia Province">
<text>Paktia (Pashto – &quot;Paktyā&quot;) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the east of the country. Forming part of the larger Loya Paktia region, Paktia Province is divided into 15 districts and has a population of roughly 623,000, which is mostly a tribal society living in rural areas. Pashtuns make up the majority of the population and a small percentage include Tajiks. Gardez is the provincial capital. The traditional food in Paktia is known as (dandakai) which is made from rice and mung bean or green gram. 

It&#x27;s also significant for being the area where Operation Magistral by The Soviet Union took place. Late Nov, of 1987, to Jan, of 1988 is then it took place, when Soviet Forces retreated.

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

==History==
Paktia (pashto پکتیا - Paktya) is the land of pakthas or pakth (pashto - پکهت), According to Mandala 7 of the Rigveda (RV 7.18.7), &quot;Together came the Pakthas (44?4), the Bhalanas, the Alinas, the Sivas, the Visanins. Yet to the Trtsus came the Arya&#x27;s Comrade, through love of spoil and heroes&#x27; war, to lead them&quot;.

The Pakthas were one of the tribes that fought against Sudas in the Dasarajna the Battle of the Ten Kings (dasarajna). The battle of the 10 Kings took place before Mahabharat, so at least around 5000 BC.

Pakthas are an ancient people that find reference in Sanskrit and allegedly in Greek sources as a people living in the region which includes south-eastern province (Loya Paktia) in Afghanistan and northern parts of Pakistan. The terms Pashtun and Pashto have only been in use for the past 500 years. Prior to that Pashtuns were the Pakhtas of Rig Veda and Paktuans of Herodotus.

the word &quot;-ia&quot; is a Latin ending (-ia in Ancient Greek) used to form abstract nouns. In this case, the &quot;abstract&quot; noun referred to a nation, that is, a collection of people and the locations where they lived.

For example, the land of the &quot;Germani&quot; was Germania. so the word &quot;ia&quot; is a Greek word which means &quot;land of&quot; as Armenia, Syria, Australia.

India was known as &quot;Sapt-Sindhu&quot; - which means seven rivers in Sanskrit-Indus (known as Sindhu then), The name of India is a corruption of the word Sindhu.

Persians uttered &#x27;s&#x27; as &#x27;h&#x27; and called this land Hindu. Greeks pronounced this name as Indus and The Romans picked up the name and the &quot;land of Indus&quot; came to be known as &quot;India&quot;. they were Indus and as we know the word &quot;ia&quot; mean &quot;the land of&quot; so it becomes India the land of Indus. Now we know that they did the same thing with pakthus

Pakthus pakt/pakth-ia (la=land of) = paktia, The land of pakthus.

Pactyan (pactian)

These Pactyans lived on the eastern frontier of the Achaemenid Arachosia Satrapy as early as the 1st millennium BCE.

Herodotus ( The Father of the History ) - An ancient Greek historian, wrote a book 2500 years ago in 500BC. He used the word Pactyans (pashto-پاکتیان) for Pashtuns who lived in Loy Paktia (which includes modern Afghanistan and Pakhtunkhwa regions).

-Herodotus, The Histories, Book III, Chapter 102,

Section 1

Herodotus also mentions a tribe of known as Aparytai (&#x27;AntapÚtal). Thomas Holdich has linked them with the Afridi tribe.

-Herodotus, The Histories, Book III, Chapter 91,

Section 4

So what does the word &quot;pactyan&quot; mean !?

to understand what does it mean, we have to do the same thing that we did before. If we translate pactyan or pactian into pashto we will get the word &quot;پکتیاوال&quot; which we use it for a person from Loya patkia.

the word &quot;ian&quot; denotes the people belongs to any country or land.

So pashtuns are pactyan, pactyans are pakthas and pakth is one the oldest Aryan tribe. And their land is Loya paktia

Paktia used to be a unified province with Khost and Paktika until Khost became a separate province in 1985. These three provinces are now referred to as &quot;Loya Paktia&quot;, meaning &quot;Greater Paktia&quot;. Paktia came to prominence during the 1980s, when a significant portion of Afghanistan&#x27;s leadership originated from the province. Some of the more notable leaders include Najibullah Ahmadzai (a former President of Afghanistan), Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Shahnawaz Tanai, and Sayed Muhammad Gulabzoi.

===Soviet–Afghan War (1988)===
Between 7 and 8 January 1988, in Paktia Province, near the Pakistani–Afghan border, the Battle for Hill 3234 took place, which was a successful defensive action fought by the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment, 39 Soviet Airborne Troops, in Soviet occupied Afghanistan against a force of up to 200 to 250 Mujahideen rebels.

Soviet commanders wanted to secure the entire section of the road from Gardez to Khost.

One of the most important points was the nameless hill designated Hill 3234 by its height of 3234 meters, which was assigned to the 9th Company of the 345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment led by Colonel Valery Vostrotin.

The 39-man company landed on the hilltop on 7 January 1988, tasked with creating and holding a hilltop strong point from which to observe and control a long section of the road beneath and thus secure it for the safe passage of convoys.

Shortly after landing, the airborne troopers, who were well trained and experienced in Afghan conditions, started to take up positions which covered both the road and the uphill passages. Just as they had dug in, the mujahideen began their attack at 1530 hrs. First they fired with all possible weapons including recoilless guns and RPGs. After a few salvos, Soviet artillery replied and silenced some of the mujahideen&#x27;s guns, with the commander of the first platoon, Lt. Viktor Gagarin, directing fire via radio. When rebel fire slackened, it was clear that this was the beginning of an infantry assault.

The airborne troopers were attacked by a coordinated and well-armed force of between 200 and 250 mujahideen. Attacks were made from two directions, indicating that the assailants may have been assisted by rebels trained in Pakistan by American agents. During the ensuing battle, the Soviet unit was in constant communication with headquarters and received everything the leadership of 40th Army had to offer in terms of artillery support, ammunition, reinforcements, and helicopter evacuation of the wounded.

The exhausted and mostly wounded Soviets were nearly out of ammunition but continued to occupy the hill until the last convoy passed through the road below.

The Soviet forces sustained very low casualties, with six men killed and 28 injured out of 39. Two of the soldiers killed, Vyacheslav Alexandrovich Alexandrov and Andrey Alexandrovich Melnikov, were posthumously awarded the golden star of the Hero of the Soviet Union. All of the paratroopers in this battle were given the Order of the Red Banner and Order of the Red Star.

According to Soviet estimates, the mujahideen lost over 200 men.
And Soviets lost 70–200 men . 
The Mujahideen wore black uniforms with rectangular black-yellow-red stripes.

===After 1991===

Immediately after the fall of the Taliban government, Paktia was one of the most chaotic regions in the country, as a small civil war broke out between rival militia commanders for control of the province, and Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters gave occupying U.S. troops some of their heaviest losses in the cave complexes south of Gardez.

Paktia was the site of heavy fighting between Taliban insurgents and ISAF-backed Afghan National Security Forces. Paktia was one of the last redoubts of organized Taliban resistance; much of Operation Anaconda took place in Zurmat, Paktia&#x27;s largest district. Pacha Khan Zadran was appointed provincial governor by Hamid Karzai in January 2002, but Zadran faced strong local opposition and was prevented from entering Gardez by Haji Saifullah, a local tribal elder who considered Zadran to be a &quot;smuggler&quot;, &quot;tyrant&quot; and &quot;killer&quot;. Forces loyal to Zadran attacked Gardez several times and were resisted by Saifullah&#x27;s militia, leading to many people being killed. Zadran was sacked by Karzai after ordering a deadly rocket attack at Gardez in February 2002.

February 2003, the 1st Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Gardez commenced with the objective of providing funding for local Afghan projects concurrent to a reinforced security presence in overwatch. The PRT Gardez composition includes a reinforced platoon from the 504th 82nd ABN along with US Army Civil Affairs contingent plus Special Forces. In March 2003, USAID and State Department representatives joined the 1st Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Gardez.

In September 2006, Governor Hakim Taniwal was killed by a Taliban suicide bomber as he left his office in Gardez. At the time, Taniwal was the highest-ranking post-Taliban official to be killed by insurgent forces in the country.

On 12 February 2010, five civilians including two pregnant women and a teenage girl were killed by U.S. special forces during the Khataba raid. U.S. special forces were later accused of attempting to cover up the incident. Head of Joint Special Operations Command, U.S. Vice Admiral William McRaven stated that the deaths were a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;, offered an apology, accepted responsibility for the deaths and made a traditional Afghan condolence offering of sheep.

After some early unrest a long period of relative calm followed, despite the occasional high-profile incident such as the 2006 assassination of the governor, by a suicide bomber. There was a rise in violent incidents when the pullout of American troops neared in 2014.

Some regions of Paktia are also believed to be a safe haven for militants from the Haqqani network, an anti-government combat organisation involved in the Taliban insurgency.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 30% in 2005 to 36% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant fell from 9% in 2005 to 3% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) fell from 35% in 2005 to 27% in 2011.
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) fell from 65% in 2005 to 24% in 2011.

==Geography==

Paktia shares a border with the Kurram district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. Within Afghanistan, it borders Logar Province, Ghazni Province, Paktika Province, and Khost Province, in counterclockwise order.

Paktia is a largely mountainous province, with most of the population living in the central valley stretching from Ahmadkhel in the east down through Zurmat and into neighboring Paktika province. The eastern part of the province, particularly Tsamkani and Dand Aw Patan, is a second valley leading into Pakistan.

Jaji (Zazi) and Jani Khel districts are largely mountainous with much smaller inhabited valleys.

The Khost-Gardez Pass area, to the south of Gardez, is mountainous with settlements limited to the main pass and smaller valleys.

As of 2005, Azra district is no longer a part of Paktya. It has been attached to Logar province to the north, to which it is much more closely connected by roadways and people.

==Demographics==


As of 2021, the total population of the province is 622,831. According to the Institute for the Study of War, &quot;The province is predominantly Pashtun, with a small Tajik population.&quot; According to the figures below, the ethnic groups of the province are as follows: 91% Pashtun and 9% Tajiks.

<doc id="457275" wikidata="Q145327" url="?curid=457275" title="Bhinneka Tunggal Ika">
<text>Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is the official national motto of Indonesia. It is inscribed in the national emblem of Indonesia, the Garuda Pancasila, written on the scroll gripped by the Garuda&#x27;s claws. The phrase comes from Old Javanese, meaning &quot;Unity in Diversity,&quot; and is enshrined in article 36A of the Constitution of Indonesia. The motto refers to the unity and integrity of Indonesia, a nation consisting of various cultures, regional languages, races, ethnicities, religions, and beliefs.

The phrase is a quotation from an Old Javanese poem Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular, a famous poet of Javanese literature during the reign of the Majapahit empire in the 14th century, under the reign of King Rājasanagara (also known as Hayam Wuruk).

==Meaning==
Translated word for word, bhinnêka is a sandhi form of bhinna meaning &quot;different&quot;; the word tunggal means &quot;one&quot; and the word ika means &quot;it&quot;. Literally, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is translated as &quot;It is different, [yet] it is one&quot;. Conventionally, the phrase is translated as &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot;, which means that despite being diverse, the Indonesian people are still one unit. This motto is used to describe the unity and integrity of Indonesia which consists of various cultures, regional languages, races, ethnicities, religions, and beliefs. As head of the Faculty of Philosophy of Gadjah Mada University, Rizal Mustansyir, writes, &quot;the motto of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika explains clearly that there is diversity in various aspects of life that makes the Indonesian nation a unified nation.&quot;

==History==

=== Origins ===
The phrase originated from the Old Javanese poem Kakawin Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular a famous poet of Javanese Literature during the reign of the Majapahit empire sometime in the 14th century, under the reign of King Rājasanagara, also known as Hayam Wuruk. The Kakawin contains epic poems written in metres. The poem is notable as it promotes tolerance between Hindus (especially Shivaites) and Buddhists.

=== Adoption ===
The phrase Bhinneka Tunggal Ika was published in an article entitled &quot;Verspreide Geschriften&quot; which was written by a Dutch linguist orientalist Johan Hendrik Casper Kern. Kern&#x27;s writings were later read by Mohammad Yamin, who then brought the phrase to the first Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK) session, between 29 May to 1 June 1945.

The motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika was later incorporated into the state emblem, the Garuda Pancasila. Reporting from the Directorate General of Culture of the Republic of Indonesia, the state symbol was designed by Sultan Hamid II and announced to the public on 15 February 1950.

The phrase, along with Pancasila as national emblem and 20 other articles, is officially included into the Constitution of Indonesia after the second amendment of the constitution was ratified on People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR) parliamentary session in 7–18 August 2000.

== Full stanza ==

===Original===
This quotation comes from canto 139, stanza 5. The full stanza reads as follows:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Rwāneka dhātu winuwus Buddha Wiswa,&quot;
&quot;Bhinnêki rakwa ring apan kena parwanosen,&quot;
&quot;Mangka ng Jinatwa kalawan Śiwatatwa tunggal,&quot;
&quot;Bhinnêka tunggal ika tan hana dharma mangrwa.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Translation===
&lt;poem&gt;It is said that the well-known Buddha and Shiva are two different substances.
They are indeed different, yet how is it possible to recognise their difference in a glance,
since the truth of Jina (Buddha) and the truth of Shiva is one.
They are indeed different, but they are of the same kind, as there is no duality in Truth.&lt;/poem&gt;

This translation is based, with minor adaptations, on the critical text edition by Soewito Santoso.

== Other sources ==
This idea is a constant theme throughout Mpu Tantular&#x27;s writings and can also be found in his other writing, the Kakawin Arjunawijaya, canto 27 stanza 2:

===Original===
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;ndan kantênanya, haji, tan hana bheda saṅ hyaṅ&quot;
&quot;hyaṅ Buddha rakwa kalawan Śiwarājadewa&quot;
&quot;kālih samêka sira saṅ pinakeṣṭi dharma&quot;
&quot;riṅ dharma sīma tuwi yan lêpas adwitīya&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

===Translation===
&lt;poem&gt;Clearly then, Your Majesty, there is no distinction between the Deities: 
the &quot;hyaṅ&quot; Buddha and Siwa, the lord of gods,
both are the same, they are the goals of the religions; 
in the &quot;dharma sīma&quot; as well as in the &quot;dharma lêpas&quot; they are second to none.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="457277" wikidata="Q188157" url="?curid=457277" title="Parwan Province">
<text>Parwan also spelled Parvan (Pashto/Dari: پروان) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan. It is the largest province of the Greater Parwan region and has a population of about 751,000. The province is multi-ethnic and mostly rural society. The province is divided into ten districts. The town of Imam Abu Hanifa serves as the provincial capital. The province is located north of Kabul Province and south of Baghlan Province, west of Panjshir Province and Kapisa Province, and east of Maidan Wardak Province and Bamyan Province. The province&#x27;s famous tourism attraction is the Golghondi Hill, also known as “the flower hill,” located in Imam Azam about an hour away from the capital city of Kabul. After Panjshir this province has been considered as one of the main raising points of Afghanistan War against Soviets.

The name Parwan is also attributed to a town, the exact location of which is now unknown, that supposedly existed during prehistory, in the nearby Hindu Kush mountains.

Despite a four-decade-long state of war in Afghanistan, Parwan was relatively free of conflict by the mid-2010s. While occasional attacks on government or international forces were reported, they were usually minor. Such incidents in Parwan mostly involved grenade attacks on the residences of government officials or roadside bombs. Bagram Air Base, which was one of the largest US military bases in Afghanistan, is located in Parwan.

==History==
In 329 BC, Alexander the Great founded the settlement of Parwan as his Alexandria of the Caucasus. It was conquered by Arab Muslims in 792 AD. In 1221, the province was the site of the battle between the invading Mongols, led by Genghis Khan, and the Khwarezmian Empire led by Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, where the Mongols were defeated. 

The Kingdom of Kapisa (known in contemporary Chinese sources as Chinese: 漕國 Caoguo and Chinese: 罽賓 Jibin) was a state located in what is now Afghanistan during the late 1st millennium CE. Its capital was the city of Bagram. The kingdom stretched from the Hindu Kush in the north to Bamiyan and Kandahar in the south and west, out as far as the modern Jalalabad District in the east.

The famous Moroccan traveler and scholar, Ibn Battuta, visiting the area in 1333 write:

The area was subsequently ruled by the Timurids and Mughals until Ahmad Shah Durrani made it part of the Durrani Empire in 1747. In 1840, Parwan was the site of a major battle in the First Anglo-Afghan War where the invading British were defeated. Parwan&#x27;s modern history began with the construction of a new textile factory in the town of Jabal Saraj in 1937. Parwan was involved in the Soviet–Afghan War as some of the fiercest fightings took place in the area. In the 1990s it was the site of heavy resistance against the Taliban.

===Recent history===

Following the removal of the Taliban in late 2001, the United States Armed Forces took control of Bagram Air Base and began using it as one of their main bases in Afghanistan. A Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) led by South Korea helped the locals with development activities in the province until 2014. In mid-February 2011, five rocket-propelled grenades hit the newly built South Korean military base housing the provincial reconstruction team and civilian aid workers. No one was injured in the attack, but it came hours after a visit by South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan-jin, raising suspicions of Taliban involvement. The opening ceremony of the base was postponed indefinitely.

A plan to build a power plant in the province is under consideration. A large portion of Parwan&#x27;s economy relies on remittances from the Afghan diaspora living abroad.

In July 2012, the Taliban executed a married woman in front of a large crowd after she was found guilty of adultery. It was reported that the woman had a secret affair with a married military commander of the Afghan National Army. In August 2021, Parwan was captured by the Taliban during their offensive.

<doc id="457278" wikidata="Q2569076" url="?curid=457278" title="March, Cambridgeshire">
<text>March is a Fenland market town and civil parish in the Isle of Ely area of Cambridgeshire, England. It was the county town of the Isle of Ely which was a separate administrative county from 1889 to 1965. The administrative centre of Fenland District Council is located in the town.

The town grew by becoming an important railway centre. Like many Fenland towns, March was once an island surrounded by marshes. It occupied the second largest &quot;island&quot; in the Great Level. As the land was drained, the town grew and prospered as a trading and religious centre. It was also a minor port before becoming, in more recent times, a market town and an administrative and railway centre. March is situated on the banks of the navigable old course of the River Nene, today mainly used by pleasure boats.

==History==
March was recorded as &quot;Merche&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, perhaps from the Old English &quot;mearc&quot; meaning &#x27;boundary&#x27;. Modern March lies on the course of the Fen Causeway, a Roman road, and there is evidence of Roman settlements in the area.
Before the draining of the fens, March was effectively an island in the marshy fens. The town probably owes its origin to the ford on the old course of the River Nene, where the road between Ely and Wisbech, the two chief towns of the Isle of Ely, crossed the river. At one time shipping on the River Nene provided the basis of the town&#x27;s trade, but this declined with the coming of the railways in the 19th century.

A single arch bridge was built over the River Nene towards the north end of the town in 1850. High Street, which is the chief thoroughfare, is continued over the bridge to Broad Street on the north side of the Nene, and The Causeway is lined with a fine avenue of elm and other trees.

A theatre was built for Joseph Smedley in 1826.

HM Prison Whitemoor, opened in 1991, lies slightly to the northwest of the town. Whitemoor is a maximum security prison for nearly 500 men in Category A and B.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering March, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: March Town Council, Fenland District Council, and Cambridgeshire County Council. The district and county councils are also members of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. The town council is based at March Town Hall in the Market Place. A town mayor is elected by councillors at the annual meeting in May each year. The town council administers allotments, sponsors band concerts and owns the March Museum. Fenland District Council is also based in the town, at Fenland Hall on County Road.

March is in the parliamentary constituency of North East Cambridgeshire.

===Administrative history===
March was historically a chapelry within the ancient parish of Doddington, which formed part of the North Witchford hundred of Cambridgeshire. The chapelry of March became a separate civil parish in 1866. The North Witchford hundred formed part of the Isle of Ely, which was historically a liberty under the secular jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ely. The bishop&#x27;s jurisdiction was ended by the Liberty of Ely Act 1837.

A local board district covering the chapelry of March was established in 1851. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. March Urban District Council built the Town Hall in 1900 to serve as its headquarters.

Between 1889 and 1965, the Isle of Ely was an administrative county with its own county council, whilst also forming part of the wider geographical county of Cambridgeshire. Isle of Ely County Council chose to base itself in March, building County Hall on County Road in 1909 (renamed Fenland Hall in 1974). Between 1965 and 1974, the administrative county covering March was called Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely.

March Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new Fenland District Council. A successor parish called March was created covering the area of the abolished urban district, with its parish council taking the name March Town Council.

==Markets==
With a long history of trading, in the reign of Elizabeth I, March was a minor port. In 1566 eight boats, capable of carrying one, one and a half, or two cartloads, were used in the coal and grain trades. A certain amount of traffic in coal and other commodities, carried in barges, was observed by Dugdale in 1657. Local tradesmen&#x27;s tokens of 1669, and a silver shilling token of 1811, have been noted.

Originally a market appears to have been held near the original town (then village) centre, on land beside The Causeway. A Market Cross (now called The Stone Cross) points towards the existence of an early market and this cross was erected in the early 16th century. This site was near St Wendreda&#x27;s Church. In 1669, the town successfully petitioned King Charles II and in 1670 he granted the Lord of the Manor of Doddington a Royal Charter with the right to hold a market with two annual fairs, in spite of the opposition of Wisbech Corporation. This market was held on Fridays. The Lord of the Manor of Doddington, who owned a large part of March, gave special permission to the townspeople to sell their goods on some of his land in the town centre. This site, now called the Market Place, was then known as Bridge Green Common and later named Market Hill.

In 1785, the tolls were assessed at £6 per year. Soon after this the market appears to have lapsed, though the fairs continued to prosper. The development of the market was impeded by the lack of a covered hall and because market day in several neighbouring towns fell on the same day (Friday). In 1807, the Vestry decided that it was not hygienic for goods to be loaded or unloaded in the vicinity of the market and ordered all saw pits, timber and other encroachments around the Market Place to be removed. The market was struggling during this time and an attempt to revive it in 1821 was not very successful. A Buttercross, also known as a market house, was erected in 1831. This building also housed the town fire engine and had an upstairs room that for a time housed the Clock House School and later the Town Surveyor&#x27;s Office. This office was covered by a turret which housed the Town Clock (purchased by public subscription about 1750) and the Fire Bell. In later refurbishments this clock was re-housed in St Peter&#x27;s Church Tower. The Town Stocks were also placed in the Market Place and local offenders (and those who refused to go to church) were placed in them. The want of a market house was remedied, in a makeshift fashion, by Sir Henry Peyton (who was the Lord of the Manor of Doddington). His building, however, was only by , and provided only 14 stalls under cover.

After the opening of the railway in 1847 another attempt was made to increase the market. In 1851 the market had been said to be &quot;making progress&quot;; and £150 was subscribed to give a treat to the poor at its reopening. The clash with other market days was solved in December 1856 by changing market day from Friday to Wednesday &quot;by private arrangement and without any formalities&quot;. The tolls were, however, collected in an arbitrary and haphazard way; they were assessed for poor rate purposes at £10. 
Statute fairs for the hiring of servants took place each autumn, this was also an opportunity to socialise, and shows and ginger bread stalls were set up, the large numbers could also attract pickpockets.
In 1872, the Board of Health bought a Shand and Mason fire engine that was the town&#x27;s first steam appliance and was housed in the Market House. In the same year the vestry agreed to erect a urinal at the back of the Buttercross for use by boys attending the Clock House School, but would not erect a water closet (toilet).

The market toll-keeper in 1888, though he had no fixed scale of charges and kept no record of receipts, was said to be taking about £50 a year. The success and prosperity of the market fluctuated over the years and an attempt by the Local Board to purchase the market rights to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee of 1887 was a failure. However, in 1897, Sir Algernon Peyton agreed to sell the market rights, the Market Place and Market House to March Urban District Council for £800. At that time the market was leased to F. B. Phillips, who agreed to surrender his lease in 1898 subject to receiving the market tolls for one year without charge.

The market rights passed to Fenland District Council following the local government reorganisation in 1974. The current (2020) market days are Wednesday and Saturday.

==Religion==

The inhabitants of the town are served by eleven churches.

===St Wendreda&#x27;s Church===
St Wendreda, to whom the oldest church in the town is dedicated, is the town&#x27;s own saint and March is the only known church dedication to her. She was a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon who may have been a daughter of King Anna of East Anglia (killed 654) one of the first Christian Kings of the kingdom of East Anglia. Two of her possible sisters, Etheldreda and Sexburgha, who were the abbesses of Ely and Minster-in-Sheppey respectively, are better known saints. She is also associated with Exning, Suffolk.

The saint&#x27;s relics were enshrined in gold in Ely Cathedral, until in 1016 they were carried off to battle in the hope they would bring victory to Edmund Ironside, the son of King Ethelred. But at the Battle of Ashingdon the army of King Canute captured the relics and he presented them to Canterbury Cathedral. In 1343 the relics were returned to March, but their final resting place is unknown.
The church is known for its magnificent double-hammer beam roof with 120 carved angels; it is regarded as one of the best of its kind. John Betjeman described the church as &quot;worth cycling 40 miles in a head wind to see&quot;. The church describes itself as an evangelical church &quot;with an emphasis on biblical teaching&quot;.

===Other churches===
In Victorian times, other Church of England churches were built in March, nearer to where most of the inhabitants now lived. Thomas Henry Wyatt was responsible for the design of St John&#x27;s (consecrated 1872), St Peter&#x27;s (built 1881) and St Mary&#x27;s (Westry, built 1874). The four March Anglican churches now share a &#x27;Team Ministry&#x27;.

Trinity Church is now a joint Methodist and United Reformed Church. It was built as a Methodist church in the late 19th century to replace the small St Paul&#x27;s Methodist Chapel in Gas Road. Development work was carried out during the late 1980s to convert St Paul&#x27;s Methodist Church into Trinity Church by joining St Paul&#x27;s, the United Reformed Church, and the Primitive Methodist church.

Centenary Baptist Church, founded in 1700, is a member of the Baptist Union. Additionally, there is a Grace Baptist church, Providence Baptist, which was rebuilt in 1873.

An Elim Pentecostal Church meets in March Community Centre. March Evangelical Fellowship meets on Upwell Road. Fenland Community Church is unique in the local area in focussing on the needs of people with learning difficulties.

Roman Catholics are served by weekly masses in the Anglican church in Chatteris, the combined parish of March and Chatteris being dedicated to Our Lady of Good Counsel and St Peter.

===Folklore===
An &quot;old legend told how the people of March in the 13th century endeavoured to build a church on the site where the present cross stands, but the devils were utterly opposed to the proposal. They considered the fenland was especially theirs ... As fast as the people of March dug their foundations and built their church the devils came and pulled the work down... This conflict lasted some years, when the March people, not to be beaten, set up the stone crucifix as an object of terror to the devils. It succeeded in its object. The devils left the town, and that is how the cross came to occupy its present position, which no doubt would have been the better site for the church.&quot;

==March Museum==
March has its own museum, located on the High Street. It is in the building that was originally the South District Girls School, constructed in the 1850s, it went from school to school, until 1976 when the building was purchased by the Town Council. The Museum was opened in 1977.

It is open every Saturday and Wednesday from 10:30 – 15:30 and contains a vast amount of local memorabilia, both from March, and its surrounding villages. Such artefacts include the clock face from the Church of St Mary, Benwick and a large collection of cameras.

==Transport==
===Rivers===
The town is on either side of the River Nene (Old Course). A narrow boat marina provides berths and boats for hire.

===Roads===
The town now has a western bypass to take the A141 and some of the traffic away from the town centre. The B1099 and B1101 pass through the town.

===Railways===
The town was an important railway centre, with a major junction between the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway at March railway station. The station is from London by rail, north of Cambridge, north west of Ely and south of Wisbech.

Whitemoor marshalling yards, built in the 1920s and 30s, were once the second largest in Europe, and the largest in Britain. They were gradually phased out during the 1960s and shut down in 1990. HM Prison Whitemoor was built on part of the site. The natural regeneration of the remaining resulted in its classification as a potential country park. In addition, a new housing development was constructed adjacent to the site. However, in 2002, Network Rail identified a need for a supply depot and redeveloped part of the site.

The tracks of the March to Wisbech line remain and currently (2019) a review is taking place to assess reopening the Bramley Line. The line has been identified as a priority for reopening by the Campaign for Better Transport.

==March March march==
The &quot;March March march&quot; is a walk from March to Cambridge, which has been walked in the month of March by students and academics from the University of Cambridge since 1979. The marchers sing the &quot;March March March March&quot;. The point of the walk is that it is pointless; it has spawned a shorter version called the May Manea Mania.

==March delivery office==

March Royal Mail sorting office (previously a full post office) dates from 1936. It is unusual in that it is one of a handful of post offices that display the royal cypher from the brief reign of Edward VIII.

==Economy==
In the town centre there are independent shops and retailers such as Boyes, Boots, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Lidl and Superdrug. Out-of-town development has taken place. In 2008, Meadowland retail park opened with an Argos Superstore, Mattressman, Carpetright, Halfords and The Original Factory Shop. Tesco also extended their store to a significantly larger store next to B &amp; M.

The town centre has several bars and restaurants. In 2008, the Barracuda Group changed the landmark Ye Olde Griffin Hotel into a &quot;Smith &amp; Jones&quot; branded pub it is now back to being branded as The Ye Olde Griffin Hotel. It is now part of the Stonegate pubs chain. In March 2011 J D Wetherspoon opened a pub in the former Hippodrome cinema and bingo hall.

The town&#x27;s major employers are Whitemoor Prison, Tesco and Sainsbury&#x27;s, and the many food processing factories in the area.

==Sport and leisure==
March has a Non-League football club, March Town United, who play at the GER Sports Ground on Robingoodfellows Lane. They won the United Counties Division One title in the 1953–54 season and the Eastern Counties League in the 1987-88 season.

Norwood Nature Reserve is a site north of the railway station.

<doc id="457281" wikidata="Q183015" url="?curid=457281" title="Samangan Province">
<text>Samangan (Persian: ; Pashto: ) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located north of the Hindu Kush mountains in the central part of the country. The province covers and is surrounded by Sar-e Pol Province in the west, Balkh in the north, Baghlan in the east, and Bamyan in the south.

Samangan province is divided into 7 districts and contains 674 villages. It has a population of about 325,000 which is multi-ethnic and mostly a rural society. The city of Aybak serves as the provincial capital.

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

==History==

The earliest known history of the province is linked to the identification of the Samangan by Aoros Ptolemy as the place of the Varni or Uarni and the fortified city of Samangan on the banks of the Khulm River identical to the Bhaktria regi on the Dargydus river south east of Zariaspa. The ruins found here established the city&#x27;s founding by Eukratides, the King of Bactria. It was then known as Edrisi the size of the Khulm city. 
Historicity of the Samangan town dates to the time of the Kushan Empire during the 4th and 5th centuries when it was a famous Buddhist centre. Witness to this period is seen now in the form of ruins at a place called the Takht-e Rostam, which is located 3 km from the town on a hilltop. Arabs and Mongols came to this place when it was already famous as a Buddhist religious centre. Aibak was the name given to this place when, during the medieval period, caravans used to stop here.

Afghanistan has various archaeological sites where caves were hewn out of rocks and inhabited by Buddhists. &quot;One of the most spectacular sites is that of Takth i Raustam, near Samangan (Haybak), north of Hindu Kush passes. It includes a complex of stupa with monastery, hewn out of the rock. Other caves have been found near Jalalabad and at the site of Humay Qal&#x27;a southwest of Ghazni.

The Buddhist in Takth i Raustam here in the form of a mound, located on the hilltop, represents the earliest link to the evolution of Buddhist architecture in Afghanistan

The area was conquered by the Hephthalites followed by the Saffarids who brought Islam. The Samanids took it and controlled it until the Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century, they were replaced by the Ghorids. After the Mongol invasion the Timurids took possession.

Between the early 16th century and the mid-18th century, the Province was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara. It was given to Ahmad Shah Durrani by Murad Beg of Bukhara after a treaty of friendship was reached in or about 1750, and became part of the Durrani Empire. It was ruled by the Durranis followed by the Barakzai dynasty, and was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan wars that were fought in the 19th and 20th centuries. It remained peaceful for about one hundred years until the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War.

===Recent history===
After the Afghan Civil War, the town of Darra Souf in Samangan Province was occupied by Ustad Mohammad Mohaqiq and the Taliban in late 1999. The Taliban forces gained control of the area from January to March 2000 including nearby Sar-e-Pol and Baghlan provinces, where they were reported to have massacred an unknown number of civilians.

On May 8, 2000, several men from Baghlan were driven up to the Robotak Pass in Samangan province, approximately 20 miles north of the city of Samangan (100 miles south of Mazar-i-Sharif) and were executed, later found by local farmers in shallow graves which the Taliban had dug for them.

After the removal of the Taliban government in late 2001, the Karzai administration took over control of Afghanistan. In the meantime, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) established a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in the province. After getting training by ISAF, the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) are providing security for the population of the province.

The province has a fairly good security situation, with the United Nations Department for Safety and Security (UNDSS) reporting a calm and stable condition. However, on 15 February 2011 an ISAF peacekeeper from Finland was killed in a roadside bombing near Samangan City, and on 14 July 2012, Ahmed Khan Samangani, a member of the National Assembly of Afghanistan, was killed when a suicide bomber infiltrated his daughter&#x27;s wedding party in the city of Samangan. The bomb also killed the provincial head of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), and 13 other guests, and 60 were injured, including senior police and army commanders. The deputy provincial governor, Ghulam Sarkhi, claimed that the death toll was likely to rise.

==Healthcare==

Health services provided by the Ministry of Health are fairly basic with 6 health centres and 3 hospitals with 60 beds. They are reasonably well staffed with 21 doctors and 33 nurses. To cater to the pharmaceutical needs of the patients, there are 24 pharmacies, two are run by the government and the rest are privately owned. In 2006, two dozen women completed a midwifery course.
The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 7% in 2005 to 18% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant fell from 29% in 2005 to 20% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 19% in 2005 to 27% in 2011. 
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 37% in 2005 to 47% in 2011.

Owing to its relative isolation, Samangan province is underdeveloped with no energy infrastructure and has a high rate of illiteracy, although some students have access to education in neighbouring Mazari Sharif. Educational facilities in the province is at a low level with literacy rate recorded at only 19% for the province as a whole, with 28% literacy rate among men and a low of 10% among women. The Kuchi people are the least literate, recording a literacy rate of only 3%, that too among men only. The province has 159 primary and secondary schools with attendance of 59,915 students; 83% of schools are boys&#x27; schools with 68% students. While the village schools are within easy reach, the high schools are generally about 10 km away from the villages.

==Economy==

Agriculture and some small scale mining are the main industries of the province. Economic condition of the people is very hard with nearly 12% households finding it difficult to meet the food requirements to sustain. This has resulted in allocations of food aid to the province.

In October 2010, the first dish-making factory run by women began operations. The women were trained for several months and now work in two shifts. During the last few years, thousands of other women have worked on a variety of different projects such as tailoring and carpet knitting.

===Status of infrastructure===
As of 2005, safe drinking water access is available to 7% of households (falls to a low of 4% in rural areas). However, some drinking water facility is available in some form to about 71% of households. Still many households have to travel for long hours to the nearest source of water.

Electricity supply is minimal, limited to only about 5% of the population with 80% supplied from government sources. The transport sector is still underdeveloped. Only 28% of roads are good for use by motorized traffic throughout the year with this percentage rising to 41% in some seasons. However roads are non-existent in 28% of the province.

Education is still in a nascent state of development with only 19% being literate, as of 2005, with literacy among men limited to 28% and literacy among women limited to a mere 10%; literacy among the Kuchis population is the least at about 3% of men only. There are 59 primary and secondary schools in the province with enrolment of 59,915 students. However, travelling distance to the schools varies, with primary schools being most accessible while High Schools involve about 10 km of travel.

As of 2005, basic health services maintained by the Ministry of Health were fairly developed with 6 health centres and 3 hospitals with a total of 60 beds. The health centres were well staffed with 21 doctors and 33 nurses.

Food security is a major issue since nearly 12% of the population receive less than the minimum daily caloric intake to sustain good health. Food consumption is poor in both rural and urban areas and as a result food aid has become essential.

From the security angle, the United Nations Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS) has reported security situation in the province calm and stable.

;Mineral resource
Marble export sustains Afghan economy. The marble is extracted and processed in 21 factories in the country, including the famous brown marble from Samangan province. This adds to the economy of the province.

===Agriculture===

The economy revolves around agriculture, with farmers in Samangan province cultivating grains, fruits, and nuts on the region&#x27;s fertile river plains. The province of Samangan is second only to the northwestern Afghan province of Badghis in terms of pistachio production. As of 2005, 10 Agricultural cooperatives were functioning in the province with 665 enrolled members controlling an area of 5532 ha which brought prosperity to its members. The staple food crops grown in the province are wheat, barley and potato and flax. The horticultural or garden crops grown are grapes, pomegranates and other fruit and nut trees. Cash crops grown in a few villages were sesame, cotton and tobacco; and they are mostly in Dara-i-Soofi-Payin and Aybek districts; cotton was major crop in Hazrat-i-Sultan district while tobacco was produced on a large scale in the Roi-Do-Ab district. Use of fertilizers is also common among 60% of the on both field and garden crops Industries are almost non existent in the province, except for minor leather industry producing the karakul skin and a few small scale handicrafts producing rugs, shawls, jewellery and carpets.

Horse breeding also sustains the economy of the province as it caters particularly for the popular sport of buzkashi in Afghanistan. Buzkashi is a traditional Central Asian team sport played on horseback in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, northern Pakistan and Kazakhstan.

;Irrigation
The agricultural economy of the province is further enhanced with irrigation facility provided to 21,242 ha. The irrigated areas deciphered from the land-cover maps, under a collaborative project of FAO, the United Nations Development Programme and the Afghan Geodesy and Cartography Head Office, Kabul are in Aybak, Samangan - 5 426ha, Dara-I-Suf, Samangan - 4 149ha, Hazrati Sult, Samangan -6 884 ha, Khuram Wa Sa, Samangan - 1 733 ha and Ruyi Du Ab, Samangan -3,049 ha.

==Cultural heritage==
The historical cultural heritage in the province which is mainly at Samangan City, the provincial headquarters of Samangan are the Takt-e Rostam and the adjacent Buddhist caves and stupas on a top of hill.

;Takht-i Rustam
Takht-i Rustam (Haibak), literal meaning the throne of Rustam, named after Rustam, a king in Persian mythology, is a hilltop settlement. It is dated to the 4th and 5th centuries of the Kushano-Sassanian period, which is corroborated by archaeological, architectural and numismatic evidence. It is located 3 km to the southwest of Samangan town. It is the location of a stupa-monastery complex which is fully carved into the mountain rock. The monastery of major Buddhist tradition of Theravada Buddhism, has five chambers, two are sanctuaries and one is a domed ceiling with an intricate lotus leaf beautification. In the adjacent hill is the stupa, which has a harmika, with several caves at its base. Above one of the caves, there is square building in which there are two conference halls; one is 22 metres square and the other is circular. In one of these caves, Archaeological excavations have revealed a cache of Ghaznavid coins. The Buddhist temples near the Takht are 10 numbers known locally as Kie Tehe.

Yar Mohammad Malek cave in Roy Doaab district is a small canyon that consists of a big historical cave, believed to be endless. Many bones, silk clothes, and Islamic symbols were found in this district, but due to the erosion and landslide, the entrance of these places has disappeared. During the civil war, many of the artifacts were found by people who were displaced and lived in those caves. 

;Hazar Sum
Hazar Sum is another ancient Buddhist centre in north central Afghanistan where several caves have been found and in one of these caves a Buddhist stupa has been carved.

==Geography==
Samangan is located in northern central Afghanistan, delimited by Baghlan province in the east, Bamyan in the south, Sar-e-Pul in the south-west and Balkh province in the northwest. Samangan encompasses an area of 11218 km2 consisting 59% of mountainous terrain, 21% of semi mountainous terrain, 12% of flat land, 4.8% of semi-flat land and the balance 2.2% is unclassified land.

Some parts of the province are characterised by distinctive rolling hills and mountains and rich green valleys. The provincial jurisdiction is spread over seven administrative districts, with Samangan City as its capital. This town is located on the banks of the Khulm River, in the valley formed below the junction of Hindu Kush mountains and the Central Asian Steppe; the valley has very fertile agricultural land. The highest mountain ranges of the province thus lie to the southwest of the province, southwest of Samangan City. Only 12% of the provincial area consists of flat land. The city of Samangan lies in the Khulm River valley, with mountains to the west and east. It is located to the northwest of the city of Baghlan and about is north-west of the capital Kabul and the same distance south-east of Mazar-i-Sharif city.

Samangan Province has a long history of earthquakes which has led to the loss of thousands of people and their homes. In 1998, two earthquakes struck measuring 5.9 and 6.6 on the Richter scale, claiming some 6,000 lives along the border with Tajikistan. A series of earthquakes struck nearby Baghlan province on March 3, 2002, killing roughly 1,000 people. In April 2010 at least 11 people were killed and more than 70 injured when a 5.7 magnitude quake at a depth of 10 km struck the province. It damaged some 300 houses and killed hundreds of cattle, causing landslides which blocks some of the main roads.

==Demography==

As of 2021, the total population of the province is about 438,000, which is predominately rural with only 7% living in urban centres.

&quot;Samangan like most of Afghanistan is ethnically diverse with Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara, Turkomen and even a minority of Pashtuns living throughout the province.&quot; Roughly 72.5% people of the province speak Persian and 22.1% people speak Uzbek as their native language.

<doc id="457285" wikidata="Q182487" url="?curid=457285" title="Sar-e-Pol Province">
<text>Sar-e-Pol, also spelled Sari Pul () is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the north of the country. It borders Ghor and Bamyan to the south, Samangan to the east, Balkh and Jowzjan to the north, and Faryab to the west. The province is divided into 7 districts and contains 896 villages. It has a population of about 632,000, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a tribal society. The province was created in 1988, with the support of northern Afghan politician Sayed Nasim Mihanparast. The city of Sar-e-Pol serves as the provincial capital.

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

==History==

Between the early 16th century and the mid-18th century, the territory was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara. It was given to Ahmad Shah Durrani by Murad Beg of Bukhara after a treaty was signed in or about 1750, and became part of the Durrani Empire. It was ruled by the Durranis followed by the Barakzai dynasty. The area was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan wars that were fought in the 19th and 20th centuries. It remained peaceful for about one hundred years until the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War.

===Recent history ===
During the Afghan Civil War, the area was controlled by forces loyal to Abdul Rashid Dostum. It was captured by the Taliban in 1998. Aminullah Amin, the first senior member of the Taliban to be captured, was the former governor of the province.

Swedish-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), which has been based in Mazar-e Sharif since about 2005 and responsible for four provinces including Sar-e Pol, established an office and some troops in the province. The Afghan National Security Forces (ANFS) began expanding in the last decade and slowly took over security from International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The Afghanistan-Turkmenistan border is maintained by the Afghan Border Police (ABP) while law and order for the rest of the province is provided by the NATO-trained Afghan National Police (ANP).

In 2009, the provincial Police Chief stated that weapons had been collected from many people and three districts, namely, Sangcharak, Gosfandi, and Sozama Qala areas termed as the peaceful districts of the province. In operations against militants, the police chief said they had arrested a prominent Taliban commander Mullah Nader along with 11 other people during the recent operations. He said scores of kilograms of hashish and opium had also been seized from people during the operations.

The biggest threat to travelers in Sar-e Pol province remains highway bandits and thieves, corrupt militiamen and police, and road hazards. During the American-Afghan war, small groups of cadres were active throughout the province. These groups often relied on larger support networks in neighboring provinces.

On August 8, 2021, the Taliban regained control of the provincial capital.

==Healthcare==

The percentage of households with clean drinking water increased from 8% in 2005 to 15% in 2011.
The percentage of births attended to by a skilled birth attendant increased from 0% in 2005 to 20% in 2011.

==Education==

The overall literacy rate (6+ years of age) increased from 12% in 2005 to 23% in 2011. 
The overall net enrolment rate (6–13 years of age) increased from 22% in 2005 to 46% in 2011.

==Geography==

Sar-e Pol is a mountainous province, especially in its southern part. It covers an area of 16,360 km. Three quarters (75%) of the province is mountainous or semi mountainous terrain while one-seventh (14%) of the area is made up of flat land. The province is divided into 7 districts, containing 896 of villages.

==Demography==
As of 2021, the total population of the province was about 632,000. The major ethnic group were Uzbeks and Hazaras followed by Pashtuns, with some Tajiks and Arabs.


==Economy==

Mining and agriculture are the main industries of the province. The Government of Afghanistan signed a deal with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of oil blocks in the Amu Darya basin, a project expected to earn billions of dollars over two decades; the deal covers drilling and a refinery in the northern provinces of Sar-e Pol and Faryab and is the first international oil production agreement entered into by the Afghan government for several decades. Production of the Afghan oil began in October 2012, which was expected to increase to 1 million barrels per year in 2013.

On October 5, 2018, in Washington, D.C., Afghan officials signed a 30-year contract involving a $56 million investment by investment group Centar and its operating company Afghan Gold and Minerals Co. for exploration of an area covering 500 square km for copper, with development of mining due to begin thereafter.

Communications in and around the province are provided by Afghan Wireless, Roshan, Etisalat, and MTN Group.

<text>Takhar (Dari/Pashto: ) is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northeast of the country next to Tajikistan. It is surrounded by Badakhshan in the east, Panjshir in the south, and Baghlan and Kunduz in the west. The city of Taloqan serves as its capital. The province contains 17 districts, over 1,000 villages, and approximately 1,113,173 people, which is multi-ethnic and mostly a rural society.

==History==

=== Early history ===

=== 7th to 16th centuries ===

=== 16th to 20th centuries ===

Between the early 16th century and the mid-18th century, the territory was ruled by the Khanate of Bukhara.

It was given to Ahmad Shah Durrani by Murad Beg of Bukhara after a treaty of friendship was reached in or about 1750, and became part of the Durrani Empire. It was ruled by the Durranis followed by the Barakzai dynasty and was untouched by the British during the three Anglo-Afghan wars that were fought in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== 1964–2001 ===
It was established in 1964 when Qataghan Province was divided into three provinces: Baghlan, Kunduz and Takhar. During the 1980s Soviet–Afghan War, the area fell under the influence of Rabbani and Ahmad Shah Massoud. It was controlled by the Northern Alliance in the 1990s. It experienced some fighting between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban forces. Takhar holds notoriety as the location where Mujahideen Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud was assassinated on 9 September 2001 by suspected al-Qaeda agents.

=== 2001–2021 ===
Following the September 11 attacks, commonly known as 9/11, and amidst the United States&#x27; intervention, General Mohamad Daud and General Shajahan Noori, both widely recognized figures, played instrumental roles in leading the Afghanistan government forces to reclaim control of the northeastern province from the Taliban.

International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) took over security responsibility of the area in the early 2000s, which was led by Germany. The province also began to see some developments and the establishment of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). In a small incident in July 2008, the Afghan National Police killed Mullah Usman when several armed Taliban militants under his command raided a police checkpoint in the Kalafgan district. This was the first time since the fall of Taliban regime in 2001 that the Taliban insurgents engaged police in this province. Mullah Usman was the most senior Taliban commander in the northeast region of Afghanistan, according to the Afghan Interior Ministry.

In May 2009, Taliban insurgents fighting Afghan government attacked the Baharak district in Takhar province. A bomb attack on 28 May 2011 killed General Shahjahan Noori, Mohammed Daud Daud and injured Governor Taqwa. Several German soldiers and Afghans were also killed.

In April 2012, the water supply at the Rostaq district&#x27;s school for girls was poisoned by unknown insurgents, sickening at least 140 Afghan schoolgirls and teachers ranging in age from 14 to 30, causing them to be hospitalized and some to partially lose consciousness, though there were no deaths as a result of the incident.

During the 2021 Taliban offensive, Takhar Province experienced attacks as the withdrawal of US troops took place. In response, Mohibullah Noori emerged as a prominent figure, leading the second resistance to support security forces and prevent the Taliban from taking control of Taluqan city. Despite the Taliban eventually gaining control of the province on August 8, 2021, the Resistance Forces have remained present in the area.

=== 2015 earthquake ===

On 26 October, the 7.5 Mw Hindu Kush earthquake shook northern Afghanistan with a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;). This earthquake destroyed almost 30,000 homes, left several hundred dead, and more than 1,700 injured.

==Demographics==

As of 2021, the total population of the province is about 1,113,173 which is mostly tribal and a rural society. The main inhabitants of Takhar province are majority Tajiks and Uzbeks with a sizeable Pashtun minority. Other smaller ethnic groups include Hazaras, Gujars and Balochi.

===District information===

==Economy==

Agriculture and mining are the main industries of the province. Takhar has coal reserves which are being exploited by hand in some villages and sold in the region. The local population considers gold the most relevant resource for the Province. Gold is being washed in Takhar River, and about 2 kg are being transported to the specific weekly markets in the city of Taloqan. Also the city is a main source of construction materials like: loam, sand, and different types of stones. Takhar province is known for its salt mountains and you can find large deposits of fine salt in the region. The Takcha Khanna salt mine is one of the growing number of salt supplier, for the population of Takhar and northern Afghanistan. While the mines offer economic opportunities in the region, the availability of iodized salt considerably reduces the prevalence of health problems related to iodine deficiency.

== Biography ==
Black was born in Brooklyn Naval Hospital, Brooklyn, New York, but grew up in Las Cruces, New Mexico. In high school, he became the Future Farmers of America (FFA) president, the senior class president, and lettered in wrestling one year. He began riding bulls in rodeos while in high school, and continued riding throughout college. Black received his undergraduate degree at New Mexico State University, and completed veterinary school at Colorado State University, graduating in 1969. He was a practicing veterinarian from 1969 to 1982, specializing in large animals, such as cows and horses. During the last two years of his veterinary career, Black gained popularity through public speaking with over 250 appearances. After this, his career as a poet began. Black also hosted the public television series &quot;Baxter Black and Friends&quot;.

He wrote a column, spoke on the radio, and had short segments on RFD-TV and The Cowboy Channel. He resided in Benson, Arizona, with his wife, Cindy Lou, where they had no cell phone, television, or fax machine. One of his philosophies of life claims: &quot;In spite of all the computerized, digitalized, high-tech innovations of today, there will always be a need for a cowboy.&quot; When asked what made him decide to become a cowboy, he said, &quot;You either are one, or you aren&#x27;t. You never have to decide.&quot;

In late 2021, Black retired from writing and speaking engagements because of health issues. Black&#x27;s wife, Cindy Lou, reported on January 15, 2022, that he was in hospice care. His son-in-law explained, however, that the hospice consisted of a home health care worker checking on Black every few days because of various medical issues.

Black died from leukemia on June 10, 2022, at his residence in Benson, Arizona, aged 77.

== Radio ==
Black&#x27;s radio career began as a chance occurrence. During a news-worthy local event, he submitted some of his work to a radio station. Black specified in an interview, &quot;It was the year Yellowstone caught on fire, 1988. We were listening and they didn&#x27;t have any coverage to speak of, and it was a huge deal in our life. It was a huge deal in Colorado (where I lived) and the sky smelled like smoke and I had this big tumultuous poem about range fire... So I sent them this. I just sent it to &quot;Public Radio&quot; in Washington D.C. And two or three days later I get a call back.&quot;

Baxter was a regular commentator for 20 years on NPR beginning in the early &#x27;80s, he was a regular commentator for National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition.&quot; &quot;Baxter Black on Monday,&quot; the weekly syndicated radio program, was on the air since 1989, and his weekly syndicated column, &quot;On the Edge of Common Sense,&quot; was carried by more than 150 publications.

Most of the area was captured by the Taliban around winter 1995. It remains a major Taliban travel route to Kabul with Maidan Shar a target for terror.

The security situation rapidly deteriorated in Wardak in 2008 and 2009. According to a report by Mohammad Osman Tariq Elias, both Logar and Wardak, by the end of 2008, were under &quot;de facto&quot; Taliban control. As of April 2009, the Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan) had listed the entire province as &quot;High Risk.&quot;

In October 2017, US Forces from elements of the 1st Battalion 87th Infantry Regiment and 10th Special Operations Group launched an offensive to wrest the province from Taliban control.

<doc id="457294" wikidata="Q185575" url="?curid=457294" title="Paktika Province">
<text>Paktika (Pashto: ) is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan, located in the eastern part of the country. Forming part of the larger Loya Paktia region, Paktika has a population of about 789,000 residents, who are mostly ethnic Pashtuns but smaller communities of Tajiks and others may also be found in the province. The town of Sharana serves as the provincial capital, while the most populous city is Urgun.

In 2021, the Taliban gained control of the province during the 2021 Taliban offensive.

==Geography==

Paktika sits adjacent to the Durand Line border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is bordered by the Khost and Paktia provinces to the north. The western border is shared with the provinces of Ghazni and Zabul. The South Waziristan and North Waziristan agencies are to the east of Paktika, while Zhob District of the Balochistan province of Pakistan borders it the southeast. The Shinkay Hills run through the center of Paktika; Toba Kakar Range runs along the border with Pakistan. The Southern districts are intermittently irrigated and cultivated, the center and north are used primarily for rangeland. There are natural forests in Ziruk, Nika, Gayan, and Bermal districts 

Paktika, like many other areas of Afghanistan, has been severely deforested. This has been a cause of devastating floods in recent years. The province is mainly hilly and interspersed with seasonal river valleys. In the north, the terrain gains elevation and becomes more rugged. In the west, the Rowd-e Lurah River originates in the mountainous Omna District and flows southwest to the Ghazni Province, forming a shallow river valley that dominates the topography in the Khairkot, Jani Khel, and Dila Districts. The terrain in Omna becomes more hilly further east in proximity to Pakistan. The sparsely populated southern districts are also hilly, with descending elevation towards the south and west.

The Gomal River, which has a varied flow depending on season, runs from its origin in the mountains of the Sar Hawza District and flows south, before turning southeast to the Pakistani border, forming the broad river valley that defines the topography of the Gomal District, before flowing east through Pakistan and eventually running to the powerful Indus River.

==History==

Paktika is the southernmost part of a historical region known as Greater Paktia (Pashto: لویه پکتیا, Loya Paktia), that was once a unified province including Paktia, Khost and parts of Ghazni and Logar. The tribes that reside in this area were mentioned by the Greek historian Herodotus, who called them the &quot;Pactyans&quot; as early as the 1st millennium BCE.

In the 1970s, the provincial capital of the largely undeveloped and remote province of Paktika was moved from the town of Urgun to Sharana due to its proximity with the main highway, connecting it to the larger cities and commercial centres of Kabul, Ghazni and Kandahar.

Paktika was the site of many battles during the Soviet occupation of the country and the lawless years that followed.

The Siege of Urgun took place between 1983 and 1984.

===Recent history===
As one of the most remote provinces in Afghanistan and an area that saw much devastation in previous years, Paktika suffers from a severe lack of critical infrastructure. Reconstruction in the province after the fall of the Taliban has been slow compared to that in nearby provinces such as Khost and Zabul. This is primarily due to the remoteness of the region and repeated attacks on aid workers and NATO forces.

In June 2004, members of the Utah and Iowa National Guard helped Army Reserve Civil Affairs Soldiers from Oregon establish a Provincial Reconstruction Team base in Sharana, the provincial capital, to lead the development effort. The first full contingent of eight Civil Affairs Soldiers from the U.S. Army Reserve&#x27;s 450th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne), based in Riverdale Park, Maryland, arrived in September 2004.

The Shkin firebase was composed of special operations forces. In an article from &quot;Time&quot;, the U.S. base was described as:

:&quot;The U.S. firebase looks like a Wild West cavalry fort, ringed with coils of razor wire. A U.S. flag ripples above the 3-ft.-thick mud walls, and in the watchtower a guard scans the expanse of forested ridges, rising to 9,000 ft., that mark the border. When there&#x27;s trouble, it usually comes from that direction.&quot;

While the province hasn&#x27;t witnessed the outright fighting in the last few years that has affected provinces like Helmand, there is a constant low level of tribal violence, accompanied by criminal and Taliban activity. The last serious fighting in the province took place in 2004, amid reports that then-Governor Muhammad Ali Jalali was collaborating with Taliban forces, and that the Taliban had effectively annexed eastern portions of the province. Jalali and many of his allied officials, were replaced and U.S. Special Forces were dispatched to fight the Taliban while the Pakistani forces fought with the Taliban&#x27;s allies in neighbouring South Waziristan.
On 1 November 2004, a civil affairs convoy was ambushed near Surobi, between the Shkin firebase and Orgun-E. U.S. Army Spc. James Kearney, a turret gunner, died of a head shot from a sniper, which initiated the ambush. Two vehicles were destroyed in the engagement and three other Soldiers were wounded. The Provincial Reconstruction Team base was named Camp Kearney on 21 November 2004 to honor the sacrifice of Spc. James Kearney.
On Jun 18, 2008 in the Ziruk District Governor&#x27;s compound, two members of the Provincial Reconstruction Team, HMN Mark Retmier and CM1 Ross Toles, were killed due to rocket attacks. The mess hall on Forward Operating Base Sharana was named after CM1 Toles and the hospital was named after HMN Retmier.

Kearney Base became the nucleus of what is now Forward Operating Base Sharana.

On July 4, 2009, combat outpost Zerok in East Paktika Province was attacked. The Haqqani network insurgents attacked the COP using mortars, accurate heavy machine gun fire, RPG fire, recoils rifles, and a 5000 lb Jingle Truck VBIED that destroyed the outpost&#x27;s radio communication. The accurate enemy indirect fire from their mortars set the US mortar pit on fire, and killed two Able Company, 3rd Battalion 509th parachute Infantry regiment mortarmen, PFC Casillas and PFC Fairbairn. They were both returning fire on the 120 mm mortar. After the VBIED went off, multiple insurgents began maneuvering towards the outpost, some getting within 100 meters of the cop. Because the enemy was advancing so close to the outpost, the request for CAS was called in, but because of the DUSTWUN (large scale search) for PFC Bergdahl, (who went AWOL after abandoning his post only 100 km away from COP Zerok), air support was delayed. After intense fighting the US Paratroopers suppressed and killed most of the enemy, eventually gunships arrived and JDAMs were dropped on enemy targets.

In 2010 the 101st Rakkasan air assault took over COP Zerok. &quot;60 minutes&quot; produced a TV special documenting the unit&#x27;s takeover of the COP, entitled &quot;COP Zerok&quot;.

In late July 2011, foreign troops and Afghan special forces killed more than 50 insurgents during an operation in eastern Paktika to clear a training camp the Haqqani network used for foreign fighters, NATO said. Disenfranchised insurgents told security forces where the camp was located, the coalition said.

In November 2011, an estimated 60 to 70 Taliban insurgents were killed in an abortive attack on a joint Afghan-ISAF base in the Margha area of Barmal. No international troops were killed or injured in the incident. It is believed the insurgents crossed over from neighboring FATA and Balochistan of Pakistan. In a separate incident the governor of Sar Hawza district died in the same month after his vehicle struck a roadside bomb. Civilians have also been killed by the foreign forces.
In the spring of 2012 the 172nd Infantry Brigade opened the first Afghan National Army/ US Joint Artillery Fire Base in the Orgun District.

In early 2013 10th Mountain Division, 2–14th Infantry, Golden Dragons, took over FOB Zerok.

Eight civilians including a pregnant woman and a baby died when Polish soldiers shelled the village of Nangar Khel, where a wedding celebration was taking place. Seven Polish soldiers have been charged with war crimes for allegedly opening fire in revenge.

U.S. Army PFC Bowe Bergdahl turned himself in to the Taliban on July 4, 2009, somewhere between OP Mest, near the town of Yahya Khel, and FOB Sharana. He was freed in a prisoner trade on May 31, 2014.

Paktika was one of the provinces most affected by the 2022 Afghanistan earthquake on 22 June 2022. In Gayan District, approximately 1,800 homes, or 70 percent of the district&#x27;s homes, were destroyed, and 238 people were killed, with 393 others injured. In Barmal District, at least 500 people died, with a thousand others injured. Many houses constructed primarily of mud and wood were razed to the ground. Heavy rain and the earthquake contributed to landslides that destroyed entire hamlets. The local clinic in Gayan, which had the capacity of only five patients, was also heavily damaged. Of the about 500 patients admitted to the clinic due to the earthquake, about 200 died. Three days later, an aftershock killed five persons and wounded 11 more in Gayan District.

==Transportation==

As of May 2014, Paktika had regularly scheduled passenger flights to Kabul from Sharana Airstrip. The province&#x27;s development is considered backwards compared to the rest of the country but work on some development projects have recently began.

==Demographics==

As of 2021, the total population of the province is about 789,000, which is a multi-ethnic tribal society. According to the Naval Postgraduate School, the ethnic groups of the province are as follows: Pashtun, Tajik, Arab, Pashai, and other various minority groups. Other sources mention that ethnic Pashtuns make up around 96% of Paktika&#x27;s population. Around 15,000 people (1.8%) are ethnic Uzbeks; and about 5,000 people speak some other languages. These are most probably Hazaras or Baloch. There is also a small Tajik community in Urgun.

The overwhelming majority of Paktika&#x27;s population (around 99%) live in rural districts. The capital city, Sharana, has around 54,400 inhabitants. The majority of Pakikta&#x27;s Districts have between 25,000 and 55,000 inhabitants. Only two districts, Nika and Turwo have less than 20,000 inhabitants, with a little more than 15,000 apiece. Two of the least mountainous districts, Urgun and neighboring Barmal have nearly 90,000 inhabitants each. There are around 115,000 households, with eight members apiece, in the Province.

Most of the Population is Sunni Muslim, and belongs to the Hanafi School.

Some tribes in Paktika may be pastoral.

===Tribes===

In Afghanistan the Ghilji are scattered all over the country but mainly settled around the regions between Zabul and Kabul provinces. The Afghan province of Paktika is considered to be a heartland of the Ghilji tribe. Ghilji sub-tribes in Paktika include the Kharoti, especially in the Sar Hawza and Urgon districts, the Andar and the largest single Ghilji sub-tribe, the Sulaimankhel, who are the majority in northern and western areas of Paktika such as; Katawaz. After the great Ghilji rebellion in 1885–1886, led by Alam Khan Nasher, many members of the Ghilji tribe, such as; the Kharoti sub-tribe and particularly the Nasher clan were exiled from Loya Paktia (Paktia, Paktika and Khost) to Kunduz in the north by Amir Abdur Rahman Khan due to political reasons. They are predominantly a nomadic group unlike the Durranis who are usually found in permanent settlements. The Ghilji mostly work as herdsmen as well as construction workers and in other jobs that allow them to travel. Often possessing great mechanical aptitude, the Ghilji nonetheless have an extremely low literacy rate hovering below 10% in Afghanistan. The Ghilji regularly cross over between Afghanistan and Pakistan often being exempted from customs due to the acceptance of their nomadic traditions by officials from both countries. Population estimates vary, but they are most likely around 20% to 25% of the population of Afghanistan and probably number over 9 million in Afghanistan alone with 4 million or more found in 
The main Pashtun tribes that live in Paktika are:
*Ghilji (Bettani)
**Ibrahimzai
**Alizai
**Sulaimanzai
**Jalalzai
**Alikhel
**Boran
**Suleimankhel
**TanoKhel
**Toran
**Katawazy
**Kharoti
**Andar
*Karlanri
**Zadran (Gayan Khel Clan)
**Wazir
**Mahsud (Menzai Clan)

The Sulaimankhel are one of the largest sub-tribes of the Ghilji Pashtuns. The Sulaimankhel tribe is mainly located in the southern and eastern portions of Afghanistan; however, they also have a strong presence in the northern and western portions of Afghanistan.
The second largest Sulaimankhel population is located in Pakistan. Not only are they located in the province of Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province, but also located in Karachi and other parts of Pakistan.

The Kharoti and Sulaimankhel tribes are traditional rivals, although they co-exist together in several districts. The larger, influential and more powerful Sulaimankhel have historically had the upper hand in this rivalry. The Wazir and Kharoti are sometimes involved in a land dispute in Barmal District.

<text>Jere Cooper (July 20, 1893 – December 18, 1957) was a Democratic United States Representative from Tennessee.

==Biography==
Cooper was born on a farm near Dyersburg, Dyer County, Tennessee, son of Joseph W. and Viola May (Cooper) Cooper. He attended public schools and then was graduated from the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1914. He was admitted to the bar in 1915 and commenced practice in Dyersburg, Tennessee. He married Mary Rankley in December 1930; the couple had one son, Leon Jere Cooper, who died as a child.

==Career==
Upon the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917, Cooper enlisted in the Second Tennessee Infantry, National Guard, and was commissioned a first lieutenant. Later he was transferred, with his company, to Co K, 119th Infantry, Thirtieth Division, and served in France and Belgium. On July 9, 1918, he was promoted to captain and served as regimental adjutant until discharged from the army on April 2, 1919. After the war he resumed the practice of law in Dyersburg.

Cooper was a member of the city council and city attorney from 1920 to 1928, and was elected department commander of the American Legion of Tennessee in 1921.

Elected as a Democrat to the 71st, and to the fourteen succeeding, Congresses, Cooper served from March 4, 1929, until his death. He served as chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means (84th and 85th Congresses), and on the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation (Eighty-fifth Congress).

He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto that opposed the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;.

==Death==
Cooper died in Bethesda, Maryland, on December 18, 1957 (age 64 years, 151 days). He is interred at Fairview Cemetery, Dyersburg, Tennessee.

<doc id="457302" wikidata="Q3893468" url="?curid=457302" title="Frederic Coudert Jr.">
<text>Frederic René Coudert Jr. (May 7, 1898 – May 21, 1972) was a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York from 1947 to 1959, and a member of the New York State Senate from 1939 to 1946. Prior to serving in Congress, he was best known for his role with New York&#x27;s Rapp-Coudert Committee, which attempted to identify the extent of communist influence in the state of New York&#x27;s public education system. The committee&#x27;s inquiries lead to the dismissal of more than 40 instructors and staff members at the City College of New York, actions the committee&#x27;s critics regarded as a political &quot;witch-hunt.&quot;

==Background==
Coudert was born in New York City on May 7, 1898, the son of Frederic René Coudert, II (1871–1955) and Alice T. (Wilmerding) Coudert. He attended the Browning and Morristown Schools in New York City, then entered Harvard College in 1916, but when the US entered World War I, Coudert joined the Army. He served in France as a first lieutenant assigned to the 105th Infantry Regiment, a unit of the 27th Division. In 1918, he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia College as part of a program that awarded degrees to military members through a combination of academic study and military service.

Coudert was discharged from the army in 1919 and began attending Columbia Law School. He received his LL.B. degree in 1922, was admitted to the bar in 1923, and commenced practice in New York City. He served as an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York in 1924 and 1925.

==Politics==
Coudert was a member of The New York Young Republican Club. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for New York County District Attorney in 1929. He was a delegate to the Republican state conventions every two years from 1930 to 1948, and the Republican National Conventions every four years from 1936 to 1948.

From 1939 to 1946, Coudert was a member of the New York State Senate, sitting in the 162nd, 163rd, 164th and 165th New York State Legislatures.

He was elected as a Republican to the 80th, 81st, 82nd, 83rd, 84th and 85th United States Congresses, holding office from January 3, 1947, to January 3, 1959. Coudert voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957.

==Post-congressional career==
He continued his practice of law in New York City, and was also a member of the State Commission on Governmental Operations of New York City from 1959 to 1961. Coudert was an outspoken conservative and endorsed William F. Buckley&#x27;s 1965 Conservative campaign for the New York City mayoralty over liberal Republican Congressman John Lindsay.

==Retirement and death==
He retired due to ill health, and died in New York City on May 21, 1972. He was buried at Memorial Cemetery in Cold Spring Harbor, New York.

==Awards==
In 1941, Coudert received the Columbia University Medal for Distinguished Public Service. In addition, he was a recipient of the French Legion of Honor (Chevalier) to recognize his efforts on behalf of the French people, including serving as president of the federation of French Alliances In the United States.

==Family==
In June 1923, Coudert married sculptor Mary Callery. The marriage ended in divorce in May 1931, and in October of that year he married Paula Murray. With his first wife, Coudert was the father of daughter Catherine. With his second, he was the father of son Frederic R. &quot;Fritz&quot; and daughter Paula.

Coudert was the great-grandson of Benjamin F. Tracy, who served as United States Secretary of the Navy from 1889 to 1893.

<doc id="457305" wikidata="Q1676413" url="?curid=457305" title="J. T. Rutherford">
<text>J T Rutherford (May 30, 1921 – November 6, 2006), was an American lawyer and World War II veteran who served as a Democratic United States Congressional Representative for 4 terms from 1955 to 1963. He previously served as a state legislator from the state of Texas.

==Early life and career ==
He was born to James Thaddeus Rutherford and the former Nancy Lillian Johnson in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In 1934, his family relocated to Odessa, Texas, where he attended public schools.

===World War II ===
He served as an enlisted man in the United States Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946, of which twenty-eight months were spent overseas. He was awarded the Purple Heart. As an assault amphibian vehicle crewman, he landed in the first waves on D-Day at Tarawa, Saipan, where he was wounded, and Tinian. He retired as a major in the United States Marine Corps Reserve.

===Business career===
From 1946 to 1947, Rutherford studied at San Angelo College in San Angelo. He then transferred to Sul Ross State College in Alpine, which he attended from 1947 to 1948. From 1948 to 1950, he attended Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas.

In 1948, Rutherford married the former Sara Jane Armstrong, and the couple had three children, Cleo Ann, Charles Lane Rutherford, and Jane Ellen. Rutherford was a partner in an industrial electrical construction firm and also owned an advertising business.

==Political career ==
Rutherford served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1948 to 1952 and the Texas State Senate from 1953 to 1954.

===Congress ===
He was elected to the 84th to 87th United States Congresses from January 3, 1955, to January 3, 1963. An unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1962 to the 88th United States Congress, Rutherford was unseated by Republican Ed Foreman of Odessa, later of Dallas. His loss to Foreman was attributed to the Billie Sol Estes scandal. He missed only one floor vote of the several thousand cast while he was a representative.

He was one of the majority of the Texan delegation to decline to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto opposing the desegregation of public schools ordered by the Supreme Court in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Rutherford voted against the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960, but voted in favor of the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

He was the first chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Parks. He was awarded the U.S. Department of Interior&#x27;s Conservation Service Award in 1962 for his efforts to spearhead conservation legislation including laws that created a new national seashore on Padre Island, Cape Cod National Seashore, and Point Reyes in California.

Rutherford&#x27;s district was the old jumbo 16th district, Midland being its eastmost point and El Paso at its westmost. It also stretched hundreds of miles along the border with Mexico. The 19 counties it embraced covered 42,067 square miles—making it geographically larger than Ohio or Tennessee, among other states.

==Later career and death ==
After leaving Congress, he formed J. T. Rutherford and Associates, a government relations consulting firm. He was a director of the Gonzales Warm Springs Foundation for Crippled Children, which was established in 1943 in Gonzales County, Texas. He was also a Shriner, another group which promotes the welfare of crippled children.

===Death===
Rutherford died of complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in Arlington, Virginia, where he spent his later years.

<doc id="457307" wikidata="Q7187020" url="?curid=457307" title="Phoenix Venture Holdings">
<text>Phoenix Venture Holdings (PVH), also known as the Phoenix Consortium, was an English company formed by four businessmen (John Towers, Peter Beale, Nick Stephenson and John Edwards). Following BMW&#x27;s break-up of the Rover Group a financially complex deal involving a £500 million &quot;dowry payment&quot; from BMW, resulted in PVH purchasing the Rover marque in May 2000 for the notional sum of £10, relaunching the car company as MG Rover. MG Rover and related companies placed themselves in administration on 8 April 2005.

Four years later and after spending £16m the Government finally released the report investigating the collapse of the company. The report, which was only concerned with dealing with the directors and their actions while MG-Rover Group was still trading, revealed that the five executives involved took £42m in pay and pensions from the troubled firm before it collapsed.

The report also commented on the personal relationship between Nick Stephenson and Dr Qu Li, who was paid more than £1.6m in the 15-month period up to April 2005 for consultancy services. Additionally, fellow Director Peter Beale was accused of installing a software application, Evidence Eliminator, which may have destroyed documentation relevant to the investigation. The investigators further accused Mr Beale of giving &quot;untruthful&quot; evidence during interviews.

In return the directors have accused the findings of being a whitewash and a witch-hunt, and it remains unknown the exact details of the actions of key government ministers at the time of the collapse.

Conservative business spokesman Kenneth Clarke said it was right the report criticised the Phoenix Four, whose behaviour was &quot;disgraceful&quot;. Lord Mandelson said the Phoenix group had not shown an &quot;ounce of humility&quot; about the firm&#x27;s demise and they owed an apology to the firm&#x27;s employees and creditors. However his comments that steps will be taken to disbar the five executives have been discredited, and the report at no point uses language stronger than &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; in describing the activities of the Group Directors.

==Background==
BMW had acquired the Rover Group in 1994, but by 1999 it had become a major financial liability due to disappointing sales of some of its model ranges. In January 2000, it was reported that UK sales had fallen from more than 190,000 in 1998 to 143,000 in 1999 - a fall of more than 25% in sales for the company, despite overall new car sales increasing by 7%. Even Rover&#x27;s newest model, the Rover 75 (launched in the spring of 1999), had failed to meet sales expectations.

Since September 1999 the venture capital company Alchemy Partners, run by Jon Moulton and Eric Walters, had been in talks with BMW about acquiring Rover. When news of the talks became public on 16 March 2000, Alchemy was widely expected to take control of at least some of the Rover Group, which BMW was prepared to sell. By that time, it was already decided that BMW would retain Mini (with the launch of an all-new Mini only a year away) and sell Land Rover to Ford. These were widely seen as the two most viable parts of the Rover Group.

Alchemy intended to name the company the MG Car Company, producing the MG F roadster and possibly developing additional, limited production sports cars. The Rover brand would have been dropped and all volume production of family cars abandoned, despite these cars making up the bulk of Rover sales - with more than 100,000 being sold in Britain alone during 1999. A large percentage of the workforce at Longbridge would also have been made redundant.

Jon Moulton withdrew the Alchemy bid when the Government added extra conditions to the sale, and a march through Birmingham led by Prof Carl Chinn opposed the Alchemy bid.

On 6 April 2000, John Towers — the most prominent of the four men known as the Phoenix consortium — presented a counter-offer to BMW. The Transport and General Workers Union (T&amp;G), the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and the British public in general all threw their support behind Towers and the Phoenix Consortium, as Phoenix were the only potential bidders proposing to retain high-volume car production and full employment at the Rover plant in Longbridge, Birmingham. On 8 May, following a last-minute injection of finance from the First Union Bank of North Carolina, a deal with Phoenix was agreed. The sale was completed the next day.

Due to UK regulations that hold the prior owner of a company responsible for all redundancy payments if the said company declares bankruptcy within 3 years of sale, BMW guaranteed that Phoenix Venture Holdings (initially named MG Rover Holdings) would have enough money to keep Rover Group in business for at least 3 years following the sale. The agreed &quot;dowry&quot; from BMW was made up of a £427million interest-free loan and stocks of cars.

Kevin Howe was appointed MG Rover&#x27;s managing director in July 2000.

Phoenix&#x27;s short-term plan was to expand the MG range with sporting versions of existing Rovers, introduce new versions of the Rover 25, 45 and 75 models, reengineer and redesign the MG F, and eventually replace the entire model range with new cars developed through joint venture with another carmaker. The MG-badged versions of the Rover models were launched in the summer of 2001, and were reasonably popular. A 1.1 litre engine had already been added to the Rover 25 range, to give it a competitor at every level with most rival superminis. The MG F was updated shortly afterwards to become the MG TF, and a number of concept cars were shown to the public, hinting at all-new models which MG Rover was hoping to launch in the near future.

The consortium continued to enjoy strong UK press support for several years following the Phoenix coup, despite no all-new models being launched by the company. By 2003, MG Rover was the ninth best selling carmaker in Britain, whereas the Rover Group (which had still included Land Rover and Mini) had been the third biggest seller just five years earlier. It still had a 3.72% share of the new car market, accounting for more than 95,000 sales.

By the beginning of 2005, however, sales figures of MG Rover cars were declining sharply, not helped by the fact that most rival companies had launched all-new competitors in the previous five years. During 2004, the media had regularly reported that the company&#x27;s sales were in decline.

The Rover 25 and 45, for instance, were updated versions of designs which had first been launched in 1995, and all of their major rivals had been replaced once - and in some cases twice - since then.

<text>HM Prison Whitemoor is a Category A men&#x27;s prison near March, Cambridgeshire, England, operated by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service.

==History==
Whitemoor Prison was built on the site of an old railway marshalling yard and was opened in 1991 by Norma Major. 

In September 1994 while under the governorship of Brodie Clark, six prisoners including London gangster Andy Russell, Paul Magee and other IRA members, escaped from the prison&#x27;s Special Secure Unit after smuggling a gun into the prison. All were recaptured within minutes.

In April 2005, it was alleged that a wind turbine situated near Whitemoor Prison was being switched off in the early mornings because the flickering shadows it created annoyed inmates. The turbine had been halted because of possible security problems if prisoners became upset over the flickering shadows.

In August 2005, the prison was locked down for two days following an explosion in a wing. A full search was carried out after the firework-like blast, however it caused no damage to the prison.

In June 2006, an inspection report from His Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised staff at Whitemoor Prison for ignoring prisoners, and not responding to their queries and requests for help promptly enough. The report also criticised the prison&#x27;s healthcare provision and pharmacy, as well stating that black and Asian prisoners felt subtle discrimination against them. However, the report did praise Whitemoor&#x27;s specialist units – such as the dangerous and severe personality disorders wing – which were said to be performing well.

===Radical influence===
A further inspection report stated, in October 2008, that staff at Whitemoor Prison felt that Muslim inmates were attempting to radicalise others held at the jail. According to inspectors, officers tended to treat Muslim prisoners as extremists and potential security risks, even though only eight of them had been convicted of terrorist offences. Due to the concerns raised by this inspection, further visits by researchers from the Cambridge Institute of Criminology, commissioned by the Ministry of Justice, were arranged between 2009 and 2010 to interview staff and inmates.

In November 2011, the Cambridge Institute of Criminology published their researchers&#x27; findings. A number of prisoners had told researchers that they had converted to Islam for protection or because they were bullied into it: reasons given for conversion included &quot;seeking care and protection&quot;, &quot;gang membership&quot; and &quot;coercion&quot; as well as &quot;rebellion&quot; as Islam was seen as the &quot;underdog&quot;. Non-believers avoided confrontation with any Muslim in case it led to retribution from the wider group, and would avoid cooking pork in communal kitchens or undressing in the showers in case it caused offence. A number of non-Muslims and prison officers claimed that converts did so to join an &quot;organised gang&quot; and a &quot;protection racket&quot; which &quot;glorified terrorist behaviour and exploited the fear related to it&quot;. Non-Muslims would be visited by inmates with Islamic literature, who would tell them to &quot;read this&quot; and promise they would be safe from physical assault if they changed faith. In its conclusion, the report noted: &quot;The new population mix, including younger, more black and minority ethnic and mixed race, and high numbers of Muslim prisoners, was disrupting established hierarchies in the prison. Social relations among prisoners had become complex and less visible. Too much power flowed among some groups of prisoners, with some real risks of serious violence. There were high levels of fear in the prison. In particular, there were tensions and fears relating to &#x27;extremism&#x27; and &#x27;radicalisation&#x27;.&quot;

A report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons on Whitemoor, following an inspection in January 2014, stated that the prison housed 454 adult men, of which approximately 40% were Muslim. The report identified &quot;some Muslim prisoners convicted of terrorist offences who were an adverse influence on others&quot;.

=== 2020 Terror attack ===
At approximately 9.10am, on 9 January, two prisoners wearing fake suicide belts approached and attacked a prison officer. The prison officer received injuries to his head and neck and the attackers used improvised bladed weapons during the assault. Three prison officers and a nurse also suffered injuries as they rushed to the aid of their stabbed colleague. One of the attackers was understood to be Brusthom Ziamani, 24, who was found guilty of preparing an act of terrorism in 2015. Ziamani was assisted by another prisoner, a Muslim convert who was serving a sentence for a violent offence. The Met Police said it was &quot;deemed appropriate&quot; its counter-terrorism command unit was sent to HMP Whitemoor &quot;due to certain circumstances relating to this incident&quot;.

==The prison today==
Whitemoor houses around 500 of the most dangerous prisoners in the UK. The prison has a Dangerous Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) unit and a Close Supervision Centre (CSC). The centre is a prison inside the prison. Whitemoor does not accept any prisoners who are serving less than 4 years.

The regime includes vocational training courses in the construction industry and furniture craft, and production workshops involve recycling work and a laundry. The prison offers full-time, half-time and part-time education courses including basic skills, GCSEs, Level 3 Access to Higher Education and Open University courses.

The Healthcare Centre includes a nine bed in-patients&#x27; facility. The centre employs a full-time doctor and provides twenty-four-hour nursing services. Out of hours medical cover is provided by an on-call service. Other facilities include a gymnasium and a shop.

<text>Craig Anthony Washington (born October 12, 1941) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from Texas who served in the Texas State Senate and the United States House of Representatives.

The son of Roy and Azalia Washington, Washington graduated from Prairie View A&amp;M University in 1966 and was originally interested in becoming a doctor, but as admissions to medical school had already ceased, Washington decided to instead apply at Texas Southern University&#x27;s law school.

==Career==
In 1972, the state of Texas began electing members of the state House of Representatives and State Senate, for the first time, by single-member districts. Washington, along with four other minority candidates, Anthony Hall, George T. &quot;Mickey&quot; Leland, Benny Reyes and Cecil Bush, (dubbed the &quot;People&#x27;s Five&quot;), ran for seats in the Texas House of Representatives. Washington was elected, and represented District 86 in the state House from 1973 to 1982. He then represented District 13 in the state senate from 1983 until 1989.

Washington was elected as a Democrat to the 101st United States Congress for Texas&#x27;s 18th congressional district, by special election, December 9, 1989, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mickey Leland. He was reelected to the 102nd United States Congress and 103rd United States Congress and served from December 9, 1989, to January 3, 1995. He took stands against some projects, like the International Space Station, where spending would have flowed to his district.

In March, 1994, Washington was routed in the Democratic primary by Houston City Councilwoman Sheila Jackson Lee, winning only 36.5 percent of the vote. Lee won in November and held the seat until her death on July 19, 2024.

Since leaving Congress, Washington has practiced law in Houston and Bastrop, Texas.

<doc id="457313" wikidata="Q4586875" url="?curid=457313" title="Rick Swenson">
<text>Rick Swenson, sometimes known as the &quot;King of the Iditarod&quot;, (born 1950 in Willmar, Minnesota), is an American dog musher who was first to win the 1,049-mile (1688.2 km) Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race across the U.S. state of Alaska five times, a record he held for 30 years, until Dallas Seavey matched it by winning the 2021 Iditarod. Swenson won in 1977, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1991, and is the only person to win in three separate decades. He won his first Iditarod race at the age of 27.

Swenson competed in the Iditarod for the first time in 1976, placing 12th. The next year, he beat Jerry Riley by just 4 minutes and 52 seconds, and became known for close finishes. Swenson has won by less than an hour four times, and by less than five minutes twice. Between 1976 and 2012, he has entered the race 36 times and has completed 34 Iditarods, more than any other musher, finished in the top ten 24 times and has won $612,576 in prizes, third among all entrants. He was awarded Sportsmanship awards in 1983 and 1996, and the Leonhard Seppala Humanitarian award for dog care twice, in 1992 and 2004.

The most controversial finish in the history of the Iditarod is his 1978 loss to Dick Mackey. Swenson believed he had won—he personally crossed the finish line before Mackey. But Mackey had more dogs and a longer harness, and the nose of his lead dog crossed the finish line in 14 days, 18 hours, 52 minutes, and 24 seconds, one second ahead of the nose of Swenson&#x27;s lead dog.

Swenson moved to Alaska in 1973 to run sled dogs. He lived first in Eureka, then moved to Two Rivers in the late 1980s. He has been a fur trapper, gold prospector, and is currently a kennel owner. He also enjoys woodworking and is the father of three children. He is a member of the Alaska Miner Association, Two Rivers Mushing Association, and is on the board of directors of the Iditarod Trail Committee, which manages the race. As of 2012, he has stopped competing in the Iditarod.

<text>The Merck Index is an encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs and biologicals with over 10,000 monographs on single substances or groups of related compounds published online by the Royal Society of Chemistry.

==History==
The first edition of the Merck&#x27;s Index was published in 1889 by the German chemical company Emanuel Merck and was primarily used as a sales catalog for Merck&#x27;s growing list of chemicals it sold. The American subsidiary was established two years later and continued to publish it. During World War I the US government seized Merck&#x27;s US operations and made it a separate American &quot;Merck&quot; company that continued to publish the Merck Index.

In 2012 the Merck Index was licensed to the Royal Society of Chemistry. An online version of The Merck Index, including historic records and new updates not in the print edition, is commonly available through research libraries. It also includes an appendix with monographs on organic named reactions.

The 15th edition was published in April 2013.

Monographs in &quot;The Merck Index&quot; typically contain:
* a CAS registry number
* synonyms of the substance, such as trivial names and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry nomenclature
* a chemical formula
* molecular weight
* percent composition
* a structural formula
* a description of the substance&#x27;s appearance
