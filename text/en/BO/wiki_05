<text>The East Coast Main Line (ECML) is a electrified railway between its northern terminus at and southern terminus at . The key towns and cities of , , , , and are on the line. The line is a key transport artery on the eastern side of Great Britain running broadly parallel to the A1 road. The main line acts as a &#x27;spine&#x27; for several diverging branches, serving destinations such as Cambridge, , , and , all with direct services to London. In addition, a few ECML services extend beyond Edinburgh to serve other Scottish destinations, such as , , , or .

The line was built during the 1840s by three railway companies, the North British Railway, the North Eastern Railway, and the Great Northern Railway. In 1923, the Railways Act 1921 led to their amalgamation to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the line became its primary route. The LNER competed with the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) for long-distance passenger traffic between London and Scotland. The LNER&#x27;s chief mechanical engineer Nigel Gresley designed iconic Pacific steam locomotives including &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; and &quot;Mallard&quot;, the latter of which achieved a world record speed for a steam locomotive, on the Grantham-to-Peterborough section.

In 1948, the railways were nationalised and operated by British Railways. In the early 1960s, steam was replaced by diesel-electric traction, including the Deltics, and sections of the line were upgraded so that trains could run at speeds of up to . With the demand for higher speed, British Rail introduced InterCity 125 high-speed trains between 1976 and 1981. In 1973, a Class 41 (an HST prototype) achieved a top speed of in a test run. In the 1980s, the line was electrified and InterCity 225 trains introduced. These have in turn been largely replaced by Class 800 and Class 801 units. The November 2021 Integrated Rail Plan for the North and Midlands stated that the linespeed would be upgraded to .

The line links London, South East England, East Anglia and the East Midlands, with Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland, and is important to their local economies. It carries commuter traffic in north London as well as cross-country, commuter and local passenger services, and freight. In 1997, operations were privatised. The primary long-distance operator is London North Eastern Railway, but open-access competition on services to Northern England and Scotland is provided by Hull Trains, Grand Central and Lumo.

==Route definition and description==
The ECML is part of Network Rail&#x27;s Strategic Route G, which comprises five separate lines:

* The main line between and stations, via , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The line crosses the Anglo-Scottish border at Marshall Meadows Bay;
* The Wakefield Line, between Doncaster and , via ;
* The Northern City Line from to ; and
* The Hertford Loop Line from to Stevenage.
* The branch line to 

The core route is the main line between King&#x27;s Cross and Edinburgh, the Hertford Loop is used for local and freight services, and the Northern City Line provides an inner-suburban service to the city. The line has engineers line references (ELR) ECM1 to ECM9.

==History==
===Origins and early operations===
The ECML was constructed by three independent railway companies. During the 1830s and 1840s, each company built part of the route to serve its own area, but also intending to link with other railways to form the through route that would become the East Coast Main Line. From north to south, the companies were:

* the North British Railway (NBR), from Edinburgh to Berwick-upon-Tweed, completed in 1846.
* the North Eastern Railway (NER) from Berwick-upon-Tweed to Shaftholme just north of Doncaster.
* the Great Northern Railway (GNR) from Shaftholme to King&#x27;s Cross, completed in 1850.
The GNR established an end-on connection with the NER at Askern, famously described by the GNR&#x27;s chairman as in &quot;a ploughed field four miles north of Doncaster&quot;. Askern was connected to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, a short section of which was used to reach the NER at Knottingley. In 1871, the line was shortened when the NER opened a direct line from an end-on junction, with the GNR, at Shaftholme, just south of Askern to Selby and over Selby Bridge on the Leeds-Hull line direct to York.

Through journeys were important and lucrative for the companies and in 1860 they built special rolling stock for the line. Services were operated using &quot;East Coast Joint Stock&quot; until 1922. The trains were hauled by GNR locomotives between King&#x27;s Cross and York, which entailed utilisation of GNR running powers over the NER between Shaftholme Junction and York (which had been agreed in 1849 and exercised from the opening of the GNR in 1850); and by NER locomotives between York and Edinburgh, using NER running powers over the NBR between Berwick and Edinburgh (agreed in 1862 but not exercised until 1869).

===LNER era===
The entire ECML came under control of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923, under the Railways Act 1921 which &#x27;grouped&#x27; many small railway companies into four large ones. The LNER was the second largest railway company in Britain, its routes were located to the north and east of London. 

The LNER appointed Nigel Gresley (who was knighted in 1937) as its Chief Mechanical Engineer, and under his tenure, Pacific steam locomotives were developed as the standard express locomotive to work the line, several of which became famous, these included the Class A3, including 4472 &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot;, and the later Class A4, including 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot;. During this time &quot;Mallard&quot; set a new world-record speed for a steam locomotive (see ).

===Races to the North===

The East Coast Main Line was engaged in long running rivalry with the West Coast Main Line (WCML), the other main trunk route between London and Scotland. At various points in the late 19th century, highly publicised but unofficial races occurred between express trains on the two routes, most notably in 1888 and 1895. These races were ended over concerns over safety, but later the rivalry resumed in the 1920s and 1930s as both the LNER and its West Coast competitor, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), produced ever-more-powerful express locomotives. This reached its crescendo in the late 1930s, when the LNER introduced the famous streamlined Class A4 locomotives and the LMS countered with its own streamlined Coronation Classboth of which were capable of reaching speeds in excess of . The competition was curtailed soon thereafter by the coming of World War II.

===British Rail era===
In the aftermath of the war, Clement Attlee&#x27;s Labour Government nationalised the LNER and the other three major railway companies in Great Britain with the passage of the Transport Act 1947, and with effect from 1 January 1948 merged them into British Railways (BR). The ECML came under the control of three of BR&#x27;s regions; the Eastern Region, the North Eastern Region, and the Scottish Region (the former two were merged together in 1967). 

====Diesel era====

In the early 1960s, steam locomotives were replaced by diesel-electrics, amongst them the Deltic, a powerful high-speed locomotive developed and built by English Electric. The prototype was successful and a fleet of 22 locomotives were built and put into BR service for express traffic. Designated , they were powered by a pair of Napier Deltic engines that had been developed for fast torpedo boats. The Class 55 &#x27;Deltics&#x27; were for a time the fastest and most powerful diesel locomotives in service in Britain, capable of reaching and providing up to . When introduced into service in 1961, the Class 55&#x27;s ability to rapidly accelerate and maintain high speed with a heavy train over long distances, immediately cut over one hour from the standard London to Edinburgh journey time, from seven hours to under six. Further improvements to the infrastructure meant that by the mid-1970s, another half-hour had been cut from the journey time.

In the years following the introduction of the Deltics, sections of the ECML were upgraded for trains running at speeds of up to . On 15 June 1965, the first length of high-speed line, a stretch between Peterborough and Grantham, was completed. The next section was of line between Grantham and Newark and more sections were upgraded to enable high speeds along much of the line.

Continuing demand for reduced journey times led British Rail to introduce a successor to the Deltics, the InterCity 125 High Speed Train (HST) between 1978 and 1979. These could reach speeds up to on existing infrastructure, bringing the fastest London–Edinburgh timing down by another hour, to hours. They operated most express passenger services on the line until electrification was completed in 1991, after which they continued in use on services that run off the ECML and onto non-electrified lines. Generally popular with the public, and considered by some to be iconic, they ran on the ECML for 41 years, before being withdrawn in 2019.

In 1973, the prototype HST British Rail Class 41 recorded a top speed of in a test run on the line.

====Electrification====
There had been proposals to electrify all or parts of the ECML as far back as the early 1900s, but no significant scheme was implemented until the 1970s and 1980s, with the entire line being electrified in two stages between 1976 and 1991. 

Early proposed schemes included a 1904 proposal by the Great Northern Railway to electrify its suburban services from London. A short stretch of the ECML in the Newcastle area was electrified with a third rail in 1904, as part of the North Eastern Railway&#x27;s suburban Tyneside Electrics scheme. Following the success of this scheme, in 1919 the North Eastern Railway, planned to electrify of the main line between York and Newcastle; the scheme progressed as far as a prototype locomotive, however it was cancelled on financial grounds after 1923 when the NER was grouped into the LNER, and the new management had no interest in pursuing the scheme. In the early-1930s, studies were conducted into electrifying sections or all of the ECML. 

British Rail&#x27;s 1955 modernisation plan placed equal importance on electrification of both the West Coast Main Line (WCML) and ECML; a detailed plan drawn up in 1957 gave a completion date of 1970 for ECML electrification. However, the East Coast authorities decided that they could not wait over a decade for service improvements, and instead decided to invest in high-speed diesel traction, the Deltic and High Speed Train, as an interim measure to implement improved services, whilst West Coast electrification proceeded, and was largely complete by 1974. During the period when Richard Beeching was chairman of British Rail, WCML electrification including the spur from Carstairs to Edinburgh was seen as possible justification for the truncation of the ECML at Newcastle.

British Rail carried out electrification of the southern part of the ECML with overhead lines from London King&#x27;s Cross to between 1976 and 1977. This was authorised in 1971 for the benefit of London suburban services as part of the Great Northern Suburban Electrification Project, using Mk.3A equipment. The scheme electrified , including the Hertford Loop Line, part of the Cambridge Line from Hitchin to , and incorporated the Northern City Line to . 

In the late 1970s, a working group of British Rail and Department for Transport officials convened and determined that, of all options for further electrification, the ECML represented the best value by far. Its in-house forecasts determined that increases in revenue and considerable reductions in energy and maintenance costs would occur by electrifying the line. In 1984, the decision was made to commence the electrification of the rest of the ECML to Edinburgh and Leeds. The Secretary of State for Transport Nicholas Ridley and Minister for Railways David Mitchell played a large role in the decision to proceed.
Construction began on the second phase in 1985. In 1986 the section to Huntingdon was completed; Leeds was reached in 1988, then York in 1989 and Edinburgh in 1991. Electric services on the full length of the line began on 8 July 1991, eight weeks later than scheduled. Significant traffic increases occurred in the two years after completion; one station recorded a 58 per cent increase in passengers. The programme also electrified the Edinburgh-Carstairs branch of the WCML, to allow InterCity 225 sets to access , with the added benefit of creating an electrified path to/from Edinburgh on the WCML from the south.

In total the electrification programme covered roughly and required major infrastructure changes, including resignalling of the line from Temple Hirst Junction (near Selby in Yorkshire) to the Scottish border; the construction of new signalling centres at Niddrie, York, and Newcastle; the commissioning of ten new connections to the national electricity grid; and structure clearance and electrical immunisation works along the length of the line. Included in the structure clearance works were the 127 overbridges that crossed the ECML. Where the existing bridge clearance was insufficient, project managers favoured wherever possible the rebuilding of the bridge rather than the lowering of the track, as the latter requires considerable civil works and can create long-term drainage problems.
Where listed buildings were to be affected by the programme, BR sought approval for its plans from the Royal Fine Art Commission. Through this process a special design of overhead wiring was developed for use on the visually-sensitive Royal Border Bridge, as well as the Croxdale and Durham City viaducts. Elsewhere the standard Mk.3B equipment was deployed.

The electrification was completed at a cost of £344.4million (at 1983 prices, equivalent to £million in ), a minor overrun against its authorised expenditure of £331.9million. Of the total cost, 60 per cent was for the electrification process itself, while the remaining 40 per cent covered rolling stock, including the new InterCity 225 trains procured specially for the route. These were introduced in 1989 to operate express services. They were developed by the General Electric Company (GEC), as the winners of a competitive tender process. The InterCity 225 sets were used alongside other rolling stock, including locomotives and electric multiple units. The displaced diesel trains were reallocated predominantly to the Midland Main Line.

The infrastructure supported speeds of up to 140mph, allowing a non-stop run of three hours and 29 minutes between London and Edinburgh on 26 September 1991. As part of testing done to support safe operation the increased maximum speed, BR experimented in 1988 with using a fifth signalling aspectflashing greenon the fast lines between Peterborough and Stoke Tunnel. The flashing green aspect appeared at signals preceding one displaying an ordinary steady green aspect, and authorised running at up to 140mph. Upon encountering a steady green aspect the driver would reduce speed to no greater than 125mph, and thus be ready to react to subsequent signals in the same manner as when driving a lower-speed train. The testing found, however, that drivers couldn&#x27;t be expected to consistently and accurately interpret and respond to lineside signals when driving at the higher speed, and regulations were later changed throughout Britain to require the use of in-cab signalling whenever running service trains at speeds above 125mph. Nevertheless, , and the relevant track Sectional Appendix continued to list the capability to run special test trains in excess of 125mph as recently as 2008.

===Privatisation and renationalisation===
As part of the privatisation of British Rail in the mid-1990s, passenger operations on the ECML were offered to bidders as the InterCity East Coast franchise. It was held by Great North Eastern Railway from 1996 until 2007, when the company experienced financial difficulties; the franchise then passed to National Express East Coast until in 2009, when it too encountered financial problems and the government was forced to run the franchise itself as &#x27;East Coast&#x27;. Another attempt at returning the franchise to private-sector operation was made by Virgin Trains East Coast in 2015, but this failed in 2018, and thus since then it has been run by the public sector through the government&#x27;s operator of last resort procedure under the London North Eastern Railway brand.

===Route alterations===
The route of the ECML has been altered or diverted several times, beginning with the opening of the King Edward VII Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1906. Later, the Penmanshiel tunnel collapse in the Scottish Borders in 1979 necessitated urgent works to divert the line around the irreparably-damaged tunnel; ultimately the line was closed for five months and around of the original alignment had to be abandoned.

In the late 1970s in the north of England, the development of the Selby Coalfieldand the anticipated subsidence that might result from its workingsled the National Coal Board to pay for the construction of the Selby Diversion. Construction commenced in 1980, and was completed in late 1983 at a cost of £63million (equivalent to £million in ). The new section diverged from the original alignment at Temple Hirst Junction, north of Doncaster, bypassed Selby station and the area to be undermined by coal workings, and then joined the Leeds–York line of the former York and North Midland Railway at Colton Junction, south-west of York. The old line between Selby and York was dismantled and is now a public cycleway.

Mining subsidence discovered in 2001 also necessitated the realignment of of line at Dolphingstone in East Lothian, between and stations. The new alignment takes the form of a gentle curve of up to towards the south, supported by concrete slabs and other ground stabilisation and reinforcement techniques, and is designed to avoid the need for a permanent speed restriction. It came into use in the last week of April 2003, at a cost of £56million (equivalent to £million in ).

===Speed records===

World speed records for both steam and diesel traction have been set on the ECML.
====Steam====
LNER&#x27;s 4468 &quot;Mallard&quot; set the record for a steam locomotive at whilst descending Stoke Bank on 3 July 1938. The record remains standing today, and a trackside sign was erected in July 1998 at the milepost to commemorate the achievement.

====Diesel====
The world record for diesel-powered trains was set at on 1 November 1987, by a shortened InterCity 125 train of two Class 43 power cars and three coaches during a southbound run from Darlington to York. At least two other trains have subsequently recorded higher speeds, but the InterCity 125 record remains the highest to have been officially verified.
====Electric====
A British speed record for electric locomotives of was achieved on 17 September 1989, also at Stoke Bank, by locomotive number 91010. On 26 September 1991, an InterCity 225 shortened electric locomotive train was authorised to reach speeds up to 140mph completing the London to Edinburgh journey in 3 hours 29 minutes.

==Future==
In November 2021, as part of the Integrated Rail Plan, the DfT announced a major upgrade of the line. The upgrade is set to include major track improvements and digital signalling, leading to higher speeds, reduced journey times and increases in seat capacity. The power supply will also be upgraded to allow longer and more frequent trains.

=== East Coast Digital Programme ===
The last refresh of the lineside signalling system on the southern ECML between London King&#x27;s Cross and the Stoke Tunnel was commissioned in 1977 and as such was up for renewal between 2020 and 2029. Instead of renewing the current lineside signalling, it was decided to upgrade this section of the ECML to ERTMS in-cab signalling. This will not be the first instance of ERTMS on the UK rail network; it is in use on the Cambrian Line (where it was first piloted), on the Thameslink core Widened Lines route (with an ATO overlay), and on the Heathrow branch of the Great Western Main Line. However, it is the most complex application yet; it is the first use in the UK of ERTMS on such a busy, mixed-traffic line, with freight, commuter, regional and InterCity services sharing as little as two tracks in the tightest sections.

Unlike the Widened Lines route and the GWML, where ERTMS complements traditional lineside signals, the southern ECML will have its signals removed once the transition period to ERTMS is complete. This means that all trains running on the route will be required to be fitted with the appropriate onboard equipment. 

The Class 800 series (LNER Azuma Classes 800 and 801, Hull Trains Paragon Class 802, Lumo Class 803), Thameslink Class 700 and Great Northern Class 717 fleets are fitted with ERTMS equipment from manufacture. The Great Northern Class 387 fleet is undergoing retrofit, with the first train sent to Worksop Depot in October 2022. Following its return to service in July 2023, the remaining trains will be retrofitted in Hornsey Depot. The introduction of in-cab signalling will allow the ECML line speed to be increased to 140mph in some places. The Class 800 series trains were designed to reach this speed, but minor modifications will be required to remove the equipment that is currently limiting speeds to 125mph. There are currently no plans to retrofit ERTMS equipment to the InterCity 225 fleet, as they are expected to be withdrawn before the removal of the lineside signals; this means they will never reach their design speed of 140mph (225km/h) in service.

==Infrastructure==
The line is mainly quadruple track from London to Stoke Tunnel, south of Grantham, with two double track sections: one between Digswell Jn &amp; Woolmer Green Jn, where the line passes over the Digswell Viaduct, Welwyn North station and the two Welwyn tunnels; and one between Fletton Junction (south of Peterborough) and Holme Junction, south of Holme Fen. The route between Holme Junction and Huntingdon is mostly triple track, with the exception of a southbound loop between Conington and Woodwalton. North of Grantham the line is double track except for quadruple-track sections at , around Doncaster, between Colton Junction (south of York), and , and Newcastle. 

The line is carried along its route by several bridges and viaducts which are recognised as architecturally significant listed structures; the longest of which is the Royal Border Bridge at Berwick-upon-Tweed. Others include Digswell Viaduct, near Welwyn Garden City, at , the Ouseburn Viaduct in Newcastle at , Durham Viaduct at , and Chester Burn Viaduct in Chester-le-Street at . The King Edward VII Bridge in Newcastle was opened in 1906, replacing the older High Level Bridge as the main railway crossing of the River Tyne.

Newark flat crossing, where the ECML crosses the Nottingham–Lincoln line on the same level just north of station, is one of only two remaining flat crossings in Britain, the other being on the Cambrian Line where it intersections with the Welsh Highland Railway. Plans for grade separating the crossing with a flyover or tunnel, which would increase capacity on both lines, have been proposed on several occasions but are complicated by costs and spatial constraints at the site.

With most of the line rated for operation, the ECML was the fastest main line in the UK until the opening of High Speed 1. The high speeds are possible because much of the line is on fairly straight track on the flatter, eastern side of England, through Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, though there are significant speed restrictions because of the line&#x27;s curvature particularly north of Darlington and between Doncaster and Leeds. By contrast, the West Coast Main Line crosses the Trent Valley and the mountains of Cumbria, with more curvature and had a lower speed limit of . Speeds on the West Coast Main Line (WCML) were increased with the introduction of tilting Pendolino trains and now match the 125mph speeds on the ECML.

==Rolling stock==
===Commuter trains===

===High-speed trains===

==Operators==
The line&#x27;s current principal operator is London North Eastern Railway (LNER), whose services include regular long-distance expresses between London King&#x27;s Cross, the East Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East of England and Scotland. LNER is operated on behalf of the Department for Transport by a consortium of Arup Group, Ernst &amp; Young and SNC-Lavalin Rail &amp; Transit, which took over from Virgin Trains East Coast on 24 June 2018.

Other operators of passenger trains on the line are:
* Great Northern: medium-distance services between London King&#x27;s Cross, Peterborough, Cambridge and King&#x27;s Lynn and commuter services between Moorgate and Stevenage via either Welwyn Garden City or the Hertford Loop.
* Hull Trains: operates five trains per day between London King&#x27;s Cross and Hull and two per day between London King&#x27;s Cross and Beverley on weekdays, while at weekends there are five trains per day between London King&#x27;s Cross and Hull.
* East Midlands Railway: local services between Grantham and Peterborough, part of the service that runs between and .
* CrossCountry: cross-country services north of are routed via either Leeds or Doncaster. Leeds trains use the ECML between Wakefield Westgate and Leeds and then again north of York. Doncaster trains use the ECML north of Doncaster. Services run to and beyond Edinburgh. Occasional services run from Doncaster to Leeds before rejoining the ECML at York.
* TransPennine Express: between Liverpool Lime Street and Newcastle, also between and before they divert off the ECML to Saltburn via and Middlesbrough.
* Northern Trains: suburban services from Doncaster to Leeds and Chathill to Newcastle via and infrequent services between Newcastle and Darlington that continue to Middlesbrough and Saltburn. Services between and York also use the line from Hambleton Junction to York.
* ScotRail: services from Edinburgh Waverley to and .
* Grand Central: operates five daily services between London King&#x27;s Cross and Sunderland, branching off the main line at Northallerton; and four daily services between London King&#x27;s Cross and Bradford, branching off at Doncaster.
* Lumo: operates five daily services between London King&#x27;s Cross and Edinburgh, calling at Stevenage, Newcastle and Morpeth.

Eurostar previously held the rights to run five trains a day on the line for services from mainland Europe to cities north of London, as part of the Regional Eurostar plan, which never came to fruition.

The overnight Caledonian Sleeper occasionally uses the ECML when engineering works prevent it from using its normal train path on the WCML.

DB Cargo UK, Direct Rail Services, Freightliner and GB Railfreight operate freight services.

==Development==

===Capacity problems===
The ECML is one of the busiest lines on the British rail network and there is insufficient capacity on parts of the line to satisfy all the requirements of both passenger and freight operators.

There are bottlenecks at the following locations:
* The section of twin track within a four-line section at Welwyn North over the Digswell Viaduct and through the Welwyn tunnels
* The twin and triple-track sections located between and Peterborough.
* Just north of Newark station at a flat crossing with the Nottingham to Lincoln Line.
* The section of double track between Stoke Tunnel and Doncaster.
* The north throat of York station including Skelton Bridge Junction
* South of Newcastle to Northallerton (which is also predominately double track), leading to proposals to reopen the Leamside line to passenger and freight traffic.

Railway operations are vulnerable during high winds and there have been several de-wirements over the years due to the unusually wide spacing (up to 75 m) between the supporting masts of the overhead lines. The other cost-reduction measure was the use of headspan catenary support systems over the quadruple track sections – as employed in the Weaver Junction to Glasgow Electrification on the WCML during the 1970s. Headspans do not have mechanically independent registration (MIR) of each electrified road and thus are more complex to set up, compared to TTC (twin-track cantilever) and portal style support structures, during installation. In the event of a de-wirement of a given road, headspans result in the need to correctly set up the OLE of adjacent roads before the line can reopen to electric traction. This was a result of extreme pressure from the Department for Transport to reduce avoidable costs when the line was originally electrified between 1985 and 1990.

===Recent developments===

* The Allington Chord was constructed near Grantham in 2006, allowing services between Nottingham and to call at Grantham without having to use the ECML, trains now passing under the line. This provided sufficient extra capacity for 12 additional services between Leeds and London each day.
* Connection of the ECML to Thameslink at Belle Isle Jnc. via the Canal Tunnels as part of the Thameslink Programme (for Thameslink and Great Northern commuter services to extend to Brighton and Horsham).
* At the southern end of York station a short length of fourth track was installed in early 2011 at Holgate Junction with accompanying OLE and signalling systems. This work helped to remove one of the bottlenecks on the East Coast Main Line. Previously, trains from Leeds would sometimes have to wait before entering the station. The improvement allows for better flow of trains in and out of the station.
* Provision of a £47million grade-separated junction to the north of (the Hitchin flyover) enabling down Cambridge trains to cross the main line. The work was completed by 26 June 2013
* Major remodelling of station was completed during early 2014 providing three platform faces for services in the up direction towards London and two for ECML services travelling north on the down lines. An additional two platform faces are also available for Cross Country services to and from stations to the east of Peterborough.
* A new flying junction just south of Joan Croft level crossing in South Yorkshire to allow freight trains from Immingham to pass over the line on their way to Eggborough and Drax power stations, was completed in very early 2014. The project, known as the North Doncaster Chord, also replaced the level crossing on a minor road with a new overbridge just to the north of the original crossing point.
* Renewal and gauge enhancement of the Great Northern and Great Eastern Line which runs parallel to the ECML between Peterborough and Doncaster. This removes freight traffic from a heavily congested section of the ECML.
* A new Rail operating centre (ROC), with training facilities, opened in early 2014 at the &quot;Engineer&#x27;s Triangle&quot; in York. The ROC will enable signalling and day-to-day operations of the route to be undertaken in a single location. Signalling control/traffic management using ERTMS is scheduled to be introduced from 2020 on the ECML between London King&#x27;s Cross and Doncaster – managed from the York ROC.
* An £8.6million redevelopment of Newcastle station was completed in 2014 enhancing the existing station and provide a state-of-the-art station for thousands of passengers.
* Platform extensions at Stevenage, Grantham, Newark North Gate, Northallerton, Durham and Edinburgh Waverley stations for the InterCity Express Programme.
* Linespeed enhancement on the down slow line in the Fletton area (part of the ECML Connectivity programme) completed in March 2019.
* Additional 130-metre terminal platform on the down side for Hertford Loop trains at Stevenage, with an extra track from Langley Junction, was started in early 2019 and opened for use on 2 August 2020.
* Werrington Grade Separation was a £200million scheme to increase capacity north of Peterborough station by constructing a dive under to route rail traffic between the Stamford Lines and the GNGE line, thereby avoiding at-grade conflicts on the ECML. The project was approved in summer 2018. It was officially opened by the Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris on 14 December 2021.
* King&#x27;s Cross throat remodelling, completed in June 2021, to improve capacity and introduce higher speed turnouts reducing journey times.

===Planned or proposed developments===

The European Union Directive 96/48/EC, Annex 1 defines high-speed rail&#x27;s minimum Speed Limit as on existing lines which have been specially upgraded.

Over the years, successive infrastructure managers have developed schemes for route improvements. The most recent of these is the £247million &quot;ECML Connectivity Fund&quot; included in the 2012 HLOS with the objective of increasing capacity and reducing journey times. Current plans include the following schemes:

* Power supply enhancement on the diversionary Hertford Loop route.
* Additional turnback facility at Gordon Hill (part of the ECML Connectivity programme).
* Re-quadrupling of the route between Huntingdon and Woodwalton (HW4T), which was rationalised in the 1980s during electrification (part of the ECML Connectivity programme). This also involves the closure and diversion of a level crossing at Abbots Ripton which was approved in November 2017.
* Enhanced passenger access to the platforms at Peterborough and Stevenage.
* Replacement of the flat crossing at Newark with a flyover (scheme developed to GRIP Stage 2 by Jacobs).
* Upgrading of the Down Fast line at Shaftholme Junction from 100mph to 125mph and higher-speed associated crossovers (part of the ECML Connectivity programme).
* Modified north throat at York station to reduce congestion for services calling at platforms 9 – 11 (part of the ECML Connectivity programme).
* Freight loops between York and Darlington (part of the ECML Connectivity programme).
* Darlington station up fast line platform and future station remodelling as part of HS2.
* Fitment of TASS balises and gauging/structure works proposed by the open-access operator GNER (Alliance Rail) to enable tilt operation of Pendolino trains north of Darlington station, supporting its aspirations for express 3hr43min London to Edinburgh services.

And on a more route-wide basis the following projects:

* Power supply upgrades (PSU) between Wood Green and Bawtry (Phase 1 – completed in September 2017) and Bawtry to Edinburgh (Phase 2), including some overhead lines (OLE) support improvements, rewiring of the contact and catenary wires, and headspan to portal conversions (HS2P) which were installed at Conington in January 2018. This will include installation of static frequency converter (Frequency changer) technology at Hambleton Junction and Marshall Meadows Bay area.
* Level-crossing closures between King&#x27;s Cross and Doncaster: As of July 2015 this will no longer be conducted as a single closure of 73 level crossings but will be conducted on a case-by case basis (for example, Abbots Ripton Level Crossing will close as part of the HW4T scheme).
* Increasing maximum speeds on the fast lines between Woolmer Green and Dalton-on-Tees up to 140mph (225km/h) in conjunction with the introduction of the InterCity Express Programme, level-crossing closures, ERTMS fitments, OLE rewiring and the OLE PSU – estimated to cost £1.3billion (2014). This project is referred to as &quot;L2E4&quot; or London to Edinburgh (in) 4 Hours. L2E4 examined the operation of the IEP at 140mph on the ECML and the sections of track which can be upgraded to permit this, together with the engineering and operational costs.
* In June 2020 it was reported that the UK government would provide £350million to fund the UK&#x27;s first digital signalling system on a long-distance rail route. The signalling is to be fitted on a 100-mile (161km) section of the East Coast Main Line between King&#x27;s Cross, London, and Lincolnshire, which will allow trains to run closer together and increase service frequency, speed and reliability. The first trains are expected to operate on the East Coast Main Line using this digital signalling technology by the end of 2025, with all improvements scheduled for completion by 2030.

==Accidents==
The ECML has been witness to a number of incidents resulting in death and serious injury:

==Popular culture==

The cuttings and tunnel entrances just north of King&#x27;s Cross appear in the 1955 Ealing comedy film &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;. Also during the 1950s, the line featured in the 1954 documentary short &quot;Elizabethan Express&quot;. Later, the 1971 British gangster film &quot;Get Carter&quot; features a journey from London King&#x27;s Cross to Newcastle in the opening credits. During 2009, the motoring show Top Gear featured a long-distance race, in which LNER A1 60163 &quot;Tornado&quot;, a Jaguar XK120 and a Vincent Black Shadow competed to be the fastest vehicle to travel the full length of the line from London to Edinburgh.

The route has been featured in several train simulator games. &quot;Trainz Simulator 2010&quot; features the route between London and York, &quot;Trainz Simulator 12&quot; extends the route to Newcastle, and &quot;Trainz: A New Era&quot; brings it all the way to Edinburgh, allowing the entire 393-mile route to be driven. Train Sim World as part of their fourth installment, features the route between Peterborough and Doncaster with the LNER Class 801 and DB Cargo UK Class 66 in a weathered EWS livery. 

King&#x27;s Cross Station is also depicted as the starting point of the Hogwarts Express in the books and films of the Harry Potter franchise. This connection is marked by a tourist attraction within the station concourse, featuring the Platform sign and a luggage trolley partially embedded in the station wall with an owl cage and suitcases on it.

<text>A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) or structured probabilistic model is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables. Graphical models are commonly used in probability theory, statistics—particularly Bayesian statistics—and machine learning.

==Types of graphical models==
Generally, probabilistic graphical models use a graph-based representation as the foundation for encoding a distribution over a multi-dimensional space and a graph that is a compact or factorized representation of a set of independences that hold in the specific distribution. Two branches of graphical representations of distributions are commonly used, namely, Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. Both families encompass the properties of factorization and independences, but they differ in the set of independences they can encode and the factorization of the distribution that they induce.

===Undirected Graphical Model===

The undirected graph shown may have one of several interpretations; the common feature is that the presence of an edge implies some sort of dependence between the corresponding random variables. From this graph, we might deduce that B, C, and D are all conditionally independent given A. This means that if the value of A is known, then the values of B, C, and D provide no further information about each other. Equivalently (in this case), the joint probability distribution can be factorized as:

:formula_1

for some non-negative functions formula_2.

===Bayesian network===

If the network structure of the model is a directed acyclic graph, the model represents a factorization of the joint probability of all random variables. More precisely, if the events are formula_3 then the joint probability satisfies

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the set of parents of node formula_6 (nodes with edges directed towards formula_6). In other words, the joint distribution factors into a product of conditional distributions. For example, in the directed acyclic graph shown in the Figure this factorization would be
:formula_8.

Any two nodes are conditionally independent given the values of their parents. In general, any two sets of nodes are conditionally independent given a third set if a criterion called &quot;d&quot;-separation holds in the graph. Local independences and global independences are equivalent in Bayesian networks.

This type of graphical model is known as a directed graphical model, Bayesian network, or belief network. Classic machine learning models like hidden Markov models, neural networks and newer models such as variable-order Markov models can be considered special cases of Bayesian networks.

One of the simplest Bayesian Networks is the Naive Bayes classifier.

===Cyclic Directed Graphical Models===

The next figure depicts a graphical model with a cycle. This may be interpreted in terms of each variable &#x27;depending&#x27; on the values of its parents in some manner. 
The particular graph shown suggests a joint probability density that factors as
:formula_9,
but other interpretations are possible.
===Other types===
*Dependency network where cycles are allowed
*Tree-augmented classifier or TAN model

*Targeted Bayesian network learning (TBNL) 
*A factor graph is an undirected bipartite graph connecting variables and factors. Each factor represents a function over the variables it is connected to. This is a helpful representation for understanding and implementing belief propagation.
* A clique tree or junction tree is a tree of cliques, used in the junction tree algorithm.
* A chain graph is a graph which may have both directed and undirected edges, but without any directed cycles (i.e. if we start at any vertex and move along the graph respecting the directions of any arrows, we cannot return to the vertex we started from if we have passed an arrow). Both directed acyclic graphs and undirected graphs are special cases of chain graphs, which can therefore provide a way of unifying and generalizing Bayesian and Markov networks.
* An ancestral graph is a further extension, having directed, bidirected and undirected edges.
* Random field techniques
** A Markov random field, also known as a Markov network, is a model over an undirected graph. A graphical model with many repeated subunits can be represented with plate notation.
** A conditional random field is a discriminative model specified over an undirected graph.
* A restricted Boltzmann machine is a bipartite generative model specified over an undirected graph.

==Applications==
The framework of the models, which provides algorithms for discovering and analyzing structure in complex distributions to describe them succinctly and extract the unstructured information, allows them to be constructed and utilized effectively. Applications of graphical models include causal inference, information extraction, speech recognition, computer vision, decoding of low-density parity-check codes, modeling of gene regulatory networks, gene finding and diagnosis of diseases, and graphical models for protein structure.

<text>From Dusk till Dawn is a 1996 American western horror film directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino from a concept and story by Robert Kurtzman. Starring Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, Tarantino, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis, the plot follows a pair of American criminal brothers (Clooney and Tarantino) who take a family as hostages (Keitel, Liu and Lewis) in order to cross into Mexico, but ultimately find themselves trapped in a saloon, defending against a horde of vampires.

&quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; premiered on January 17, 1996, at the Cinerama Dome theater in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and was released on January 19 in the United States. It initially received mixed reviews from critics, who described the film as well-made if overly violent. After enjoying financial success at the box office, &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; has since become a cult film and spawned a media franchise of sequel films, a video game and other media adaptations.

==Plot==
Fugitive bank robber brothers Seth and Richie Gecko hold up a liquor store, killing clerk Pete Bottoms and Texas Ranger Earl McGraw in a shootout. They inadvertently destroy the building as they leave. At an inn room where they are hiding out, Seth returns from getting food to find Richie has raped and murdered a bank clerk they had taken hostage, much to his anger.

Jacob Fuller, a pastor experiencing a crisis of faith brought on by the death of his wife, is on vacation with his teenage children Scott and Kate in their RV. They stop at the inn and are kidnapped by the Gecko brothers, who force the Fuller family to smuggle them over the Mexican border. In Mexico, they arrive at the Titty Twister, a strip club in the desert (with a small sign over the door that reads &quot;Open from dusk til dawn&quot;), where the Gecko brothers will be met by their contact, Carlos, at dawn. Carlos will escort them to the sanctuary at &quot;El Rey&quot;, a place of safety for fugitives from justice whose admission fee is 30% of everything they have. When Richie complains to Seth that this is too high, Seth tells him it is non-negotiable.

When they come into the bar, the bartender refuses to serve them and orders them to leave, telling them that only bikers and truckers are welcome and they don&#x27;t like or welcome outsiders in their bar. Jacob however convinces the bartender that due to the special license he is required by law to have in order to drive his RV, he is technically a truck driver, convincing him to let them stay. Seth, resentful that he wasn&#x27;t considered good enough to enter at first, takes a violent dislike to the bikers and truckers. During a bar fight, the bar employees reveal themselves as vampires and kill most of the patrons. Richie is bitten by a stripper, Santanico Pandemonium, and dies, but Seth manages to kill her by shooting at a chandelier above her that impales her. Only Seth, Jacob, Kate, Scott, a biker named Sex Machine, and Frost—a Vietnam War veteran—survive. The others are reborn as vampires, including Richie, forcing the survivors to kill them all. When an army of vampires, in bat form, assembles outside, the survivors lock themselves inside, but Sex Machine is bitten, becomes a vampire, and bites Frost and Jacob. Frost throws Sex Machine through the door, allowing the vampires to enter while Frost turns into a vampire.

Seth, Kate, and Scott escape to a storeroom, followed shortly by an injured but still alive Jacob, brandishing a shotgun. In the storeroom, they fashion weapons from truck cargo the vampires have looted from past victims, including a stake mounted on a pneumatic drill, a crossbow and holy water, which requires Jacob to recover his faith to bless. Jacob, knowing he will soon become a vampire, makes Scott and Kate promise to kill him when he changes.

The group makes their final assault on the undead. Sex Machine mutates into a large rat-like creature and attacks Seth, but is killed. Jacob becomes a vampire after killing Frost but Scott hesitates to kill him, allowing Jacob to bite him. Scott kills him, but then is overwhelmed by vampires, who begin to devour him; he begs for death, and Kate kills him. As vampires surround Kate and Seth, streams of morning light enter through bullet holes in the building, making the vampires back away. Carlos arrives and his bodyguards blast open the door, letting in the sunlight which kills the vampires.

Seth chastises Carlos for his poor choice of meeting place and negotiates a smaller tribute for his admission to El Rey. Kate asks Seth if he wants her to go with him to El Rey, but he refuses, apparently concerned for her safety, leaving her with some cash. Kate drives away in the RV, leaving the Titty Twister behind, which is revealed to be the top of an eight-level partially buried Aztec temple.

==Development==
&quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; was conceived by Robert Kurtzman, who wrote the film&#x27;s initial treatment in 1988 to create work for his co-founded special effects and prosthetic makeup studio, KNB EFX Group. In 1990, KNB hired Quentin Tarantino to write the script as his first paid writing assignment, who agreed to write the screenplay for $1,500 and an agreement to have KNB provide the makeup for &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. Kurtzman originally wanted to direct &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, but as he had never directed a feature before on top of the film&#x27;s violence and unusual narrative, he could not secure the interest of a studio despite their initial proposed budget of $1–2 million. Some time after the release of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Tarantino approached Miramax and stated that his next project would be &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, albeit with Robert Rodriguez (whom he had met earlier and thought his style was perfect for the project) directing. Miramax agreed, and shooting began in the summer of 1995.

==Production==
===References to other titles===
The &quot;El Rey&quot; hideout in Mexico was taken from &quot;The Getaway&quot;, a 1958 crime novel by Jim Thompson.

Earl McGraw became a recurring character in Rodriguez and Tarantino&#x27;s works, later appearing in &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, &quot;Planet Terror&quot; and &quot;Death Proof&quot; as an Easter Egg. Chango Beer and Sex Machine&#x27;s codpiece gun are references to Rodriguez&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Desperado&quot;. Seth also returns to the hotel with Big Kahuna Burgers, which were used in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and mentioned in &quot;Death Proof&quot;. Seth Gecko also says the line: &quot;All right, Ramblers. Let&#x27;s get ramblin&#x27;!&quot;, a quote from Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. Scott&#x27;s T-shirt decoration reads &quot;Precinct 13&quot;, a reference to John Carpenter&#x27;s 1976 film, &quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot;. Salma Hayek&#x27;s character, Satanico Pandemonium, is a reference to the 1975 nunsploitation film &quot;Satánico pandemonium&quot;.

===Non-union crew===
As with many of Rodriguez&#x27;s films, &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; employed a non-union production crew, which is unusual for a production with a budget above $15 million. The making of the film, including the crew&#x27;s non-union status, was documented in &quot;Full Tilt Boogie&quot;, released two years later.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; was released on January 19, 1996. On its first week, the film grossed $10,240,805 in the United States making it the highest-grossing film of the week. The next week, the film fell to third highest in the box office where it grossed $4,851,921 being beaten by &quot;Mr. Holland&#x27;s Opus&quot; and &quot;Bed of Roses&quot;. &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; grossed $25,836,616 in the United States and $33,500,000 internationally, for a worldwide gross of $59,336,616.

On May 1, 1996, the film was banned in Ireland; Irish Film Censor Board head Sheamus Smith cited its &quot;irresponsible and totally gratuitous&quot; violence, which he felt was particularly untimely in the wake of the then-recent Dunblane and Port Arthur massacres. In January 2004, the video release was passed with an 18 certificate.

===Critical reception===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and described it as &quot;a skillful meat-and-potatoes action extravaganza with some added neat touches&quot;. In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote: &quot;The latter part of &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; is so relentless that it&#x27;s as if a spigot has been turned on and then broken. Though some of the tricks are entertainingly staged, the film loses its clever edge when its action heats up so gruesomely and exploitatively that there&#x27;s no time for talk&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote: &quot;Rodriguez and Tarantino have taken the let-&#x27;em-eat-trash cynicism of modern corporate moviemaking and repackaged it as junk-conscious &#x27;attitude&#x27;. In &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, they put on such a show of cooking up popcorn that they make pandering to the audience seem hip&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe wrote: &quot;The movie, which treats you with contempt for even watching it, is a monument to its own lack of imagination. It&#x27;s a triumph of vile over content; mindless nihilism posing as hipness&quot;.

&quot;Cinefantastique&quot; magazine&#x27;s Steve Biodrowski wrote: &quot;Whereas one might reasonably have expected that the combo of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez would yield a critical mass of nuclear proportions, instead of an atomic fireball&#x27;s worth of entertainment, we get a long fuse, quite a bit of fizzle, and a rather minor blast&quot;. In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle called the film &quot;an ugly, unpleasant criminals-on-the-lam film that midway turns into a boring and completely repellent vampire &#x27;comedy&#x27;. If it&#x27;s not one of the worst films of 1996 it will have been one miserable year&quot;.

In Marc Savlov&#x27;s review for the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, he wrote: &quot;Fans of Merchant Ivory will do well to steer clear of Rodriguez&#x27;s newest opus, but both action and horror film fans have cause for celebration after what seems like a particularly long splatter-drought. This is horror with a wink and a nod to drive-in theatres and sweaty back seats. This is how it&#x27;s done&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack features mainly Texas blues by such artists as ZZ Top and brothers Stevie Ray and Jimmie Vaughan on separate tracks. The Chicano rock band Tito &amp; Tarantula, who portrayed the band in the Titty Twister, appears on the soundtrack as well. The film&#x27;s score is by Graeme Revell. &quot;Dark Night&quot; by The Blasters plays over the film&#x27;s opening and closing credits.

==Video game==

A video game of the same name was released for Windows in 2001. It is based on events that transpire directly after the end of the film.

==Sequel and prequel==

&quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; was followed by two direct-to-video installments, a sequel &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money&quot; (1999) and prequel &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2000). They were both received poorly by critics. Danny Trejo is the only actor to appear in all three, although Michael Parks appears in both &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Hangman&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender served as producers on all three films.

==Television==

A television series inspired by the films premiered on the El Rey network in March 2014, produced and directed by Rodriguez. The show was intended to explore and expand on the characters and story from the film, providing a wider scope and richer Aztec mythology.

The series ended production in 2016 with &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reporting that the actors have been released from their contracts as of October 31.

<text>Richard Anthony &quot;Cheech&quot; Marin (born July 13, 1946) is an American comedian and actor. He gained recognition as part of the comedy act Cheech &amp; Chong during the 1970s and early 1980s with Tommy Chong, and as Don Johnson&#x27;s partner, Insp. Joe Dominguez, on &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;. He has also voiced characters in several Disney films, including &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot;, the &quot;Cars&quot; franchise, &quot;Coco,&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot;.

Marin&#x27;s trademark is his characters&#x27; strong Chicano accents.

==Early life==
Marin was born on July 13, 1946, in South Los Angeles, California, to Mexican parents Elsa (; 1923–2010), a secretary, and Oscar Marin (1922–2015), a police officer for the LAPD and US Navy veteran of World War II. Marin was born with a cleft lip, which was surgically repaired. Marin identifies as Chicano; he speaks some Spanish and often uses it in his movies.

Marin&#x27;s nickname &quot;Cheech&quot; is short for &quot;chicharrón&quot;, fried pork rind, which is a popular snack and ingredient in Latin American cuisine. In a 2017 NPR interview, Marin attributed the nickname to his uncle: &quot;I came home from the hospital, I was like a couple of days old or something, my uncle came over and he looked in the crib and he said [in Spanish], &#x27;Ay, parece un chicharrón.&#x27; Looks like a little chicharrón, you know?&quot;

In 1955, Marin and his family moved to Granada Hills, California, and he attended primary school at St. John Baptist de la Salle Catholic School. Marin then went to high school at Bishop Alemany High School, during which he started to attend folk music events at the Ash Grove on Melrose Avenue as a teenager. Afterwards, he studied at California State University, Northridge (then known as San Fernando Valley State College), where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa. During his second semester at CSUN, he worked almost full-time at Nordskog Industries in Van Nuys, while enrolled more than full-time as a college student. It was also during this time that he was socially introduced to marijuana through his fraternity, a key feature in his later film career, in addition to becoming acquainted with Timothy Leary at a Students for a Democratic Society campus event, who would become a lifelong friend. Soon after graduating CSUN as an English major in 1968, he auditioned to sing for Frank Zappa&#x27;s band, The Mothers of Invention. Not being offered the gig during his audition, a day later Marin moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, in order to evade the draft during the Vietnam War. Marin met his future comedic partner, Tommy Chong, in Calgary, Alberta.

==Career==

===Comedy albums and films===

As a part of the highly successful comedy duo Cheech &amp; Chong, Marin participated in a number of comedy albums and feature film comedies in the 1970s and 1980s. Tommy Chong directed four of their films while co-writing and starring in all seven with Marin.
===Later films and television work===
After Cheech &amp; Chong disbanded in 1985, Marin starred in a number of films as a solo actor, most notably &quot;Born in East L.A.&quot;, which was also his directorial debut, &quot;The Shrimp on the Barbie&quot;, &quot;Tin Cup&quot;, and &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot;. He made a cameo appearance as a dockworker in &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;. In 2004, he made his second appearance as a policeman, as &quot;Officer Salino&quot; in the film adaptation of John Grisham&#x27;s holiday novel &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, under the title &quot;Christmas with the Kranks&quot;, starring Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis. In 2009, Marin appeared as an auto mechanic in &quot;Race to Witch Mountain&quot;. In 2017, he played the voice of a Corrections Officer in the Pixar film &quot;Coco&quot;.

Marin appeared in the Fox sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as the voice of the Bundys&#x27; Briard dog, Buck; he voiced the character in three episodes: &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Barking&quot;, &quot;Change for a Buck&quot; and &quot;Assault and Batteries&quot;. He made the transition to full-time television work when he co-starred on the short-lived &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; spin-off &quot;The Golden Palace&quot; (1992–1993), and later with Don Johnson, Jaime P. Gomez, and Yasmine Bleeth in the police show &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996–2001), in which they played San Francisco police-detective partners. A movie of this series was rebooted in 2021. In recent years he has been active in playing supporting roles in films and performing voice overs for animated features. After appearing in a supporting role in &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, playing an independently wealthy landscape designer, Marin starred in the CBS sitcom &quot;Rob&quot;, with Rob Schneider.

Marin is a frequent collaborator of the director Robert Rodriguez, who has worked with Marin seven times; the last two installments of the &quot;Mexico&quot; trilogy, the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; trilogy, &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot; and &quot;Machete&quot;. He provided his voice for several Disney animated films, most notably Tito the Chihuahua in &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (1988), Banzai the hyena in &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), Ramone in &quot;Cars&quot; (2006) and its sequels &quot;Cars 2&quot; (2011) and &quot;Cars 3&quot; (2017). He also voiced Manuel in Disney&#x27;s live-action-animated comedy film &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot; (2008). Marin also played Pancho in &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; (1994), and reprised the Banzai role in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. 

Cheech appears in several episodes of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Lodge 49&quot; as El Confidente, a member of Lodge 55 in Mexico.

===Children&#x27;s music albums and related works===
Marin has released two best-selling albums in the children&#x27;s music genre, &quot;My Name is Cheech, the School Bus Driver&quot; (1992) and &quot;My Name is Cheech, The School Bus Driver &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;&quot; (1997). Both albums were released bilingually. In July 2007, the book &quot;Cheech the School Bus Driver&quot; was released, written by Marin, illustrated by Orlando L. Ramirez, and published by HarperCollins.

In 2005, Marin lent his voice to the animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot;. He appeared in the episode &quot;A Crown for King Juan el Bobo&quot; as the Puerto Rican folk hero Juan Bobo.

===Additional television appearances===

Marin also sings on the hidden track &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; on Korn&#x27;s album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;. It is a cover of an original song by Cheech and Chong. The song is performed by a fictional singer named Alice Bowie, played by Marin, whose appearance consists of a tutu, a Disney mouse ear hat, nipple tassels, an eye mask and dress socks. This character is featured on the cover of Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Wedding Album and the end of the duo&#x27;s first film, Up In Smoke.

In 2009, he appeared in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;Expecting a Miracle&quot;.

On March 18, 2010, Marin beat journalist Anderson Cooper and actress Aisha Tyler on &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot;&#x27;s Million Dollar Celebrity Invitational. Cooper admitted he was &quot;crushed&quot; by Marin. Marin also won his semifinal round early May but lost in the May 6–7 final to Michael McKean. He had previously won the first &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; tournament in 1992.

In January 2012, he was one of eight celebrities participating in the Food Network reality series &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. He was eliminated in the third week of the competition.

==The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture &amp; Industry==
Marin is an avid collector of Chicano art and started his collection in the 1980s. Two national touring exhibitions have featured works from his private collection. He feels that it&#x27;s important to &quot;use his celebrity status to call attention to what he saw as an under-appreciated and under-represented style of art&quot;. In collaboration with the city of Riverside, California, and the Riverside Art Museum, Marin established The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art, Culture &amp; Industry, in the City of Riverside, which opened June 18, 2022. Marin will be donating his collection of over 700 pieces of Chicano art, the largest collection of such art in the world. The center will provide a location for the presentation and study of Chicano art, and is expected to draw international attention.

==Other interests==
He is an avid golfer, although he initially disliked the sport until he co-starred in the golf-themed comedy &quot;Tin Cup&quot;. Marin also practices horse archery on a special course built on his private land. 

On April 19, 2018, Cheech (as part of GLE Brands Inc) signed an agreement with Heritage Cannabis Holdings Corporation (CSE: CANN) to have exclusive rights to use cannabis and cannabis-related products utilizing the Private Stash brand throughout Canada for a period of 2 years, with the agreement automatically renewing for an additional year upon achieving various milestones.

In 2019, he was featured in &quot;The Little Mermaid: An Immersive Live-to-Film Concert Experience&quot; playing the role of Chef Louis at the Hollywood Bowl.

==Personal life==
Marin was married in 1975 to Darlene Morley, who co-produced &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s The Corsican Brothers&quot; and also played minor roles in earlier Cheech &amp; Chong films under the name Rikki Marin. The couple had one child and divorced in 1984. Marin married artist Patti Heid in 1986; they had two children and have since divorced. Marin married his longtime girlfriend, Russian pianist Natasha Marin, on August 8, 2009, in a sunset ceremony at their home.

Marin resides in Malibu, California. He is a fan of both the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL, and the Los Angeles Dodgers of the MLB.

<text>Arpachshad (ِArabic: أرفخشذ – ʾArpaḵšaḏ;  – &quot;ʾArpaḵšaḏ&quot;, in pausa  – &quot;ʾArpaḵšāḏ&quot;; – &quot;Arphaxád&quot;), alternatively spelled Arphaxad or Arphacsad, is one of the postdiluvian men in the ShemTerah genealogy. The name is recorded in the Book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament of Christian Bible) and subsequently copied in different biblical books, including the Gospel of Luke in the New Testament.

==Biblical accounts==
According to the Book of Genesis he was one of the five sons of Shem (the son of Noah). He is the twelfth name of the Genesis genealogy that traces Abraham″s ancestry from Adam to Terah (cf. ). Beginning with Adam, nine Antediluvian names are given that predate Noah and the Flood, and nine postdiluvian, beginning with Noah&#x27;s eldest son Shem and ending with Terah.

According to the text, Arpachshad&#x27;s brothers were Elam, Asshur, Lud and Aram. Arpachshad&#x27;s son is called Selah, except in the Septuagint, where his son is Cainan, Shelah being Arpachshad&#x27;s grandson. Cainan is also identified as Arpachshad&#x27;s son in Luke and in the non-canonical book of Jubilees 8:1. The Book of Jubilees additionally identifies Arpachshad&#x27;s wife as &quot;Rasu&#x27;aya&quot;, the daughter of &quot;Susan&quot;, who was the son (or daughter in some versions) of Shem&#x27;s older son Elam. (Arpachshad&#x27;s mother is named in this source as &quot;Sedeqetelebab&quot;; for competing traditions on the name of Shem&#x27;s wife see wives aboard the Ark.)

==Identifications==
Some ancient Jewish sources, particularly Jubilees, point to Arpachshad as the immediate progenitor of Ura and Kesed, who allegedly founded the city of &quot;Ur Kasdim&quot; (Ur of the Chaldees) on the west bank of the Euphrates (Jubilees 9:4; 11:1–7) – the same bank where Ur, identified by Leonard Woolley in 1927 as Ur of the Chaldees, is located.

Until Woolley&#x27;s identification of Ur, Arpachshad was understood by many Jewish and Muslim scholars to be an area in northern Mesopotamia. This led to the identification of Arpachshad with Urfa-Kasid (due to similarities in the names and ) – a land associated with the Khaldis, whom Josephus confused with the Chaldeans. Donald B. Redford asserted that Arpachshad is to be identified with Babylon.

==Another person with the same name==
Another Arpaxad is referenced in the deuterocanonical Book of Judith as a king of the Medes, and if this supposed Median king is contemporary with the conquest of the Assyrians, he could be identified with Phraortes ( - 633 BC). If he is contemporary with Nebuchadnezzar II (named as king of the Assyrians in Judith), he might be identified with Cyaxares (r. 625–585 BC).

<text>Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a globulin protein encoded by the &quot;SERPINA7&quot; gene in humans. TBG binds thyroid hormones in circulation. It is one of three transport proteins (along with transthyretin and serum albumin) responsible for carrying the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the bloodstream. Of these three proteins, TBG has the highest affinity for T4 and T3 but is present in the lowest concentration relative to transthyretin and albumin, which also bind T3 and T4 in circulation. Despite its low concentration, TBG carries the majority of T4 in the blood plasma. Due to the very low concentration of T4 and T3 in the blood, TBG is rarely more than 25% saturated with its ligand. Unlike transthyretin and albumin, TBG has a single binding site for T4/T3. TBG is synthesized primarily in the liver as a 54-kDa protein. In terms of genomics, TBG is a serpin; however, it has no inhibitory function like many other members of this class of proteins.

==Role in diagnosis==

Thyroxine-binding globulin tests are sometimes used to find the cause of raised or lowered levels of thyroid hormone. This is done by measuring resin binding to labeled thyroid hormone, which happens only when the labeled thyroid hormone is free.

The patient&#x27;s serum is mixed with the labeled thyroid hormone; next, the resin is added to the whole mixture to measure the amount of free labeled thyroid hormone. So, for instance, if the patient is truly hypothyroid, and TBG levels are normal, then there are many sites open for binding on the TBG, since the total thyroid hormone level is low. Therefore, when the labeled hormone is added, it will bind mostly to the TBG, leaving little of it left for binding to the resin. In contrast, however, if the patient is truly hyperthyroid, and TBG levels are normal, the patient&#x27;s endogenous hormone will saturate the TBG binding sites more, leaving less room for the labeled hormone, which allows greater binding to the resin.

In patients who are truly hypo- or hyperthyroid, TBG testing is not very useful. However, if total thyroid hormone levels point to hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in the absence of accompanying symptoms, the utility of TBG testing becomes more evident, since TBG production can be modified by other factors such as estrogen levels, corticosteroid levels, or liver failure. If, for example, the TBG level is high, which can occur when estrogen levels are high, the TBG will bind more thyroid hormone, decreasing the free hormone available in the blood, which leads to stimulation of TSH, and the production of more thyroid hormone. In this case, the total thyroid hormone level will be high. And so, when labeled hormone is added, since TBG is so high, once equilibrium between the binding of endogenous thyroid hormone and the labeled hormone is achieved, less free labeled hormone will be available for uptake into the resin. On the converse, in the presence of corticosteroids, which lower TBG levels, the total thyroid hormone (bound and free) in the blood will be low. Thus, when the labeled hormone is added, since so little TBG is available in the blood, after equilibrium is achieved, only a small portion of it will bind, leaving plenty available for uptake by the resin.

<doc id="447311" wikidata="Q2246646" url="?curid=447311" title="Twin City Rapid Transit Company">
<text>The Twin City Rapid Transit Company (TCRT), also known as Twin City Lines (TCL), was a transportation company that operated streetcars and buses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Other types of transportation were tested including taxicabs and steamboats, along with the operation of some destination sites such as amusement parks. It existed under the TCRT name from a merger in the 1890s until it was purchased in 1962. At its height in the early 20th century, the company operated an intercity streetcar system that was believed to be one of the best in the United States. It is a predecessor of the current Metro Transit bus and light rail system that operates in the metro area.

==Establishment==
The origins of street rail transport in the Twin Cities are not entirely known.It allegedly dates back to 1865, when businessman and mayor Dorilus Morrison began building rails in downtown Minneapolis. He quickly joined forces with Colonel William S. King and other Minneapolis businessmen to create the Minneapolis Street Railway. However, the lines didn&#x27;t go very far and the railway was useless for a time. There are some indications that a streetcar was purchased but never used, collecting dust for several years.

On the other side of the Mississippi River, the St. Paul Railway Company started the first successful horse-drawn streetcar system of the metro area in St. Paul. Then in 1875, the reformed Minneapolis Street Railway made a deal with the Minneapolis City Council where the company would have exclusive access to street rails for 50 years if they could be up and operating in four months. The company recruited real-estate mogul Thomas Lowry, who on September 2, 1875, brought on line a route between downtown Minneapolis and the University of Minnesota.

The streetcars became popular because they rode on smooth rails, while most of the streets of the era were dirt or made of cobblestone pavers. These roads became treacherous to pedestrians and uncomfortable to ride on in horse-drawn buggies, especially during Minnesota winters.

Thomas Lowry envisioned linking together the various railways that were cropping up around Minneapolis. While other systems were popping up with more horse-drawn carriages or cable cars, Lowry pushed forward with electrification of the lines. Starting in the late-1880s, electric streetcars began moving in both Minneapolis and St. Paul. Cable cars quickly lost favor as they struggled through snowy Minnesota winters and the public quickly grew weary of slow horsecars.

==Rise of the system==

In 1890, the two cities were connected with a railway along University Avenue, the first of four rail lines linking them together. A merger of the two city systems, the St. Paul City Railway Co. and Minneapolis Street Railway, formed the Twin City Rapid Transit Company. It went on a building spree, quickly doubling the amount of electrified track in the system.

The company continued absorbing smaller competitors for the next 40 years. In 1898, the company began a transition to using company-built streetcars and machinery (such as cranes and snowplows) rather than purchasing the cars from other companies. The first such car was built as a personal streetcar for company president Thomas Lowry, although his was a special-order. The car featured one end with large windows, to make the scenery more visible. This car was used on special occasions, such as the opening of new lines and a visit by United States President William McKinley.

TCRT built some of the largest streetcars in the country. The Twin City Rapid Transit Company got into the business of building street cars at its Nicolett Shops in 1898 after concluding that cars it was operating from Eastern manufactures couldn&#x27;t hold up to Minnesota&#x27;s harsh winters. By 1906 they opened a manufacturing facility at its Snelling Shops where they not only manufactured cars for TCRT but also Chattanooga, Duluth, Seattle and Chicago among others. These cars were larger than traditional streetcars, being long and wide.
Old track was also upgraded. In the early days, a number of lines had been laid down with narrow-gauge track. These were all upgraded to (standard gauge). In addition, the basic construction of the lines improved. The rails of the Twin Cities were upgraded to the most expensive track in the country, running US$60,000 per mile. Tracks featured welded (thermite) joints, and were commonly surrounded by cobblestone or asphalt. By 1909, 95 percent of the rails were of this type of construction. They were used until the company ended streetcar service.

From 1906 to 1926, TCRT experimented with &quot;streetcar boats.&quot; Officially known as Express Boats, they were steam-powered vessels with designs reminiscent of the streetcars of the day. The boats operated between communities on Lake Minnetonka, but improved roads in that area hit ridership hard in the 1920s. Ultimately, seven were built, but most of them were scuttled in the lake in 1926.

TCRT also expanded into the suburban amusement park business by opening the Wildwood Amusement Park on White Bear Lake and Big Island Park on Lake Minnetonka. The park on Big Island was serviced by three large ferry boats from Excelsior.

As the rise of the internal combustion engine in transportation grew, the Twin City Rapid Transit acquired several bus lines that began to pop up around the time of World War I. They also acquired a taxicab company in the 1920s.

When the transportation system peaked in 1922, it had nearly of track and 1021 streetcars. Rail extended a distance of about from Stillwater on the bank of the St. Croix River in the east to Lake Minnetonka in the west. For a time, TCRT was the largest employer in the area.

It is rumored that anyone who lived in Minneapolis was no farther than (less than ) from the nearest station at that time.

==Changing labor conditions==

In 1917, a major labor strike took place in the months after the United States entered World War I. It began on October 6, and was influenced by the organization Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, also known as the &quot;Wobblies&quot;), a militant group that had been organizing unions in the region, particularly in the northern Mesabi Iron Range. Horace Lowry, son of Thomas Lowry, headed the company at this time and absolutely refused to negotiate with the striking workers. This angered workers and others who felt sympathy for them.

Angry strikers in St. Paul damaged streetcars and harassed those who had continued to work. The Minnesota Commission of Public Safety ordered the workers back on the job and they complied for a while. People again left work in late-November. On December 2, a crowd energized by speakers from the Nonpartisan League again grew angry after TCRT cut off electricity to the streetcars in downtown St. Paul, making it impossible for many people to return home. Over the following days, many were arrested and the strike was effectively broken. 800 people were eventually replaced by non-union workers.

Things turned out differently in the 1930s, although it was not a smooth transition. In 1932, most of the system&#x27;s streetcars were converted to &quot;one-man operation&quot; where, rather than requiring both a motorman to drive in front and a conductor to take fares in the rear, the motorman took over both operations. The doors on the streetcars were modified to allow easier boarding in front. So-called &quot;gate cars&quot; which had used open grating on the rear of the cars mostly disappeared from the lines. The transition from two-man to one-man operation was taking place on many streetcar lines across the country around this time.

The conversion to single-man operation meant that about half of the company&#x27;s workforce was suddenly surplus. Many employees found it hard to get work and were often forced to take strange shifts. One worker recorded having a 17-hour shift from 4:24 p.m. on Sunday to 9:49 a.m. on Monday. There was a company union, although it hadn&#x27;t done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, St. Paul Mayor William Mahoney and the National Recovery Administration, among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the Amalgamated Transit Union.

==Competition from automobiles==
With the Great Depression and the rise of the automobile, the rail lines began to decline. Buses were frequently used toward the edges of the system as long routes, especially those with low ridership, were cut back. World War II allowed the system to bounce back for a time, since strict fuel rationing and citizens&#x27; efforts to conserve resources made automobile use rather un-patriotic. However, the restrictions also hit TCRT itself since they could not afford to build many new streetcars. The company was forced to add more buses to shore up the system&#x27;s various routes.

After the war, trolley riders returned to their automobiles. TCRT&#x27;s management explored ways to upgrade the line to bring people back. Heavy wartime use meant that the rails needed to be repaired. Competition from other forms of transportation required modernization. In 1945, the company received its first streamlined PCC streetcar. The following years saw dozens of new PCC cars on the streets, although the first one remained unique in the fleet because it was the only one to have air brakes. All of the PCCs were several inches wider than standard, to match the width of the company&#x27;s older streetcars.

==Company takeover and decline==

The company had a long-standing policy of reinvestment in the rail system. When profits appeared, they were usually used to pay off loans and improve the rails, streetcars and other hardware the company owned. It was rare for the company to pay out dividends. In 1948, Wall Street speculator Charles Green bought 6000 shares of TCRT stock. He expected to quickly gain profit, but found he had purchased stock just as the company decided to set forth on some major construction. Knowing this would demolish his anticipated dividends, Green contacted other shareholders and urged them to vote out the company&#x27;s president, D. J. Strouse and put him in charge instead.

Green took control of the company in 1949 and quickly started dismantling the railway system, announcing that the company would completely switch to buses by 1958. The system&#x27;s PCCs were sold to Mexico City (91), Newark NJ (30) and Shaker Heights OH (20). Green sold his shares in 1950 to be briefly replaced by Emil B. Anderson before local lawyer Fred Ossanna ascended to head the company the next year. Ossanna held off on the teardown for a short while, but soon announced that the process would be accelerated. Lines would be removed and replaced by buses in two years.

==End of the streetcar system==

On June 19, 1954, four years before Green had envisioned, the very last streetcars ran in Minneapolis. The leftover vehicles were burned to recover the scrap metal they contained. The last streetcar was famously photographed alight behind Fred Ossanna and James Towley as Towley presented Ossanna with a check.

At the time there were a range of issues facing TCRT. Highway development enabled settlement over a wider area. Minneapolis&#x27; population peaked in the late 1940s and St. Paul&#x27;s a decade later in the late 1950s. Population growth and job growth was spread out in less dense suburbs where capital requirements for building new rail were too high compared to the potential ridership. Building rails to service these areas was cost prohibitive. Buses though could be profitable on such routes. More so other streetcar lines without connection to NCL also converted to buses, frequently having done so long before the TCRT began the process.

Fred Ossanna came to work at TCRT as a lawyer for Charles Green in the 1949 takeover of the company. Reportedly, Ossanna planned to order 25 buses from General Motors and was instead offered 525. The vast majority of buses in TCRT&#x27;s eventual bus fleet were built by GM.

Most of the activity was geared toward stripping TCRT of its assets to fill the pockets of owners and investors. Ossanna was convicted in 1960 of illegally taking personal profit from the company during the transition period. He was imprisoned along with other accomplices. Carl Pohlad, who became the owner of the Minnesota Twins in 1984, was the eventual successor of Fred Ossanna as head of Twin City Lines in the 1960s. He ultimately sold the company in 1970.

==Streetcar preservation==
Before the dismantling began, TCRT had purchased a significant number of PCC streetcars. These were sold off in 1952 and 1953, still in very good operating condition. The cars ended up in Mexico City (91 cars), Newark, New Jersey (30) and Shaker Heights, Ohio (20). Relatively few places could have taken them because of their extra width and each of these buyers had significant amounts of dedicated right-of-way. For instance, the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit commuter line in Cleveland was grade-separated in many areas. The vast majority of the older wooden streetcars, mostly built by TCRT itself, were destroyed. Out of 1240 built by the company, only five have survived to be restored and operated by rail museums.

Only two of the wooden streetcars in use in the 1950s had been given away to railfan groups before the rest of the fleet was burned. They are owned by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum (TCRT No. 1300) and the Seashore Trolley Museum (TCRT No. 1267) in Maine. One other steel-sheathed car (TCRT No. 1583) had been sent to a railway to the north in Duluth-Superior, but it was never used. It now resides at the East Troy Electric Railroad Museum in Wisconsin. A few additional cars escaped the burn pits, but they were still subjected to harsh conditions and only two are restored.
One of the streetcar boats, the &quot;Minnehaha&quot;, was found by divers and then brought to the surface in 1980. After a long wait, it was restored and has been operating on Lake Minnetonka from 1996 to 2004 by the Minnesota Transportation Museum and since then by the Museum of Lake Minnetonka. MTM also restored one of TCRT&#x27;s old PCC cars (TCRT No. 322), operated now by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum.

A number of PCC cars once owned by Twin City Rapid Transit are just beginning their lives as museum pieces. The Newark City Subway finished operation of their 24 remaining cars on August 24, 2001, replacing the cars with new light-rail trainsets. Fifteen have been sold to the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), for their collection of classic streetcars on the Market Street Railway. In addition, 12 PCCs that ran on the Shaker Heights line are now owned by the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association. Many of these cars owe their longevity to the fact that the Twin Cities area makes heavy use of salt to de-ice roadways in the winter. In anticipation of this, the cars were largely made of stainless steel to prevent corrosion.

==Historical remnants==
Other vestiges of the company&#x27;s streetcar history remained in the Twin Cities, and some surviving elements are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of the oldest structures to survive is a building in Minneapolis now known as the Colonial Warehouse. First built in 1885, it housed the headquarters of the Minneapolis Street Railway Co. during the early horsecar era and also later served as a powerhouse as the system was converted. The lines needed a lot of electricity, so hydroelectric generators were installed at Saint Anthony Falls about a mile away and the Southeast Steam Plant was also constructed nearby. The old headquarters was sold in 1908, soon after these were constructed. The steam plant was bought by the University of Minnesota, which now uses it for providing heat to the campus downriver.

A large building on Snelling Avenue in St. Paul first served as the main construction and repair shop for the streetcars when it was built in 1907. It was expanded and remodeled over the years, later becoming a major garage for the bus system. However, the complex became outdated, with poor ventilation, a leaky roof and other problems. It was finally shut down and demolished in September 2001. Allianz Field and the surrounding development now occupy the land.

Selby Hill in St. Paul was a steep climb and was a place where cable cars were used in the late 19th century before Selby Hill Tunnel was constructed in 1905 to provide a more gradual incline. The tunnel still exists, but the ends have been blocked off, and as of July 2022 has largely become a homeless encampment. It is near the Cathedral of St. Paul.

Billboards across the area were originally laid out to target passengers of the rail lines with advertising. Many of these billboards remained for decades afterward, despite the fact that automobile traffic frequently favored different routes. These finally disappeared due to city beautification efforts in the 1990s.

==Legacy to 21st century rail==
In the 1970s, the bus lines (some of which still trace former horse-drawn buggy paths) were shifted to a partially publicly funded operation overseen by the Metropolitan Council. All regional transportation for the metropolitan area was soon overseen by the Met Council&#x27;s transit agency which would take on the name Metro Transit. Twenty years after rails disappeared from Twin Cities streets, politicians and planners began proposing new light rail systems. Congestion was bad enough in 1972 that there were proposals to build new subways or people movers, but excessively high costs prevented any of the projects from getting anywhere until the end of the century. The University of Minnesota did a fair amount of research on personal rapid transit (PRT) systems and has held a number of patents on the idea.

Rail transport returned to the Twin Cities with the construction of the Blue Line, which began operations in 2004. A proposal for a heritage streetcar line running east–west through the city, possibly including PCC cars once owned by TCRT, has been examined. A Northstar commuter rail line, tracing U.S. Highway 10 northwest out of Minneapolis, opened in 2009. A connection between both of the twin cities, called the Green Line, opened on June 14, 2014. Light rail west from Minneapolis to the southwest suburbs is being constructed as of 2020. Other proposals have included adding both a commuter connection to the complete North and Southeast of downtown Saint Paul. A light rail alignment to the Southwest of downtown Saint Paul has been previously discussed, but dismissed due to the expectation of low ridership.

<text>Revaz Dogonadze ( 21 November 1931 – 13 May 1985) was a notable Georgian scientist, Corresponding Member of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences (GNAS) (1982), Doctor of Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences (Full Doctor) (1966), Professor (1972), one of the founders of quantum electrochemistry,

==Life and works==

He was born in 1931, in Tbilisi, Georgia. His father, Dr.Sc. Roman I. Dogonadze (1905–1970) was a professor of Agrarian Sciences. In 1955 Revaz Dogonadze graduated from the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute. He was Scientific Fellow (1958–1962) and Senior Scientific Fellow – Head of the Group of Quantum Electrochemistry (1962–1978) of the Department of Theoretical Investigations of the Moscow Institute of Electrochemistry (now Frumkin Institute of Electrochemistry of the Russian Academy of Science). He was Associate Professor (1963–1969) and Full Professor (1969–1973) of the Moscow State University. In 1961 he received a PhD degree, in 1966 a degree of Doctor of Sciences (Full Doctor).

Dogonadze was the first to view a chemical electron-transfer process as a quantum-mechanical transition between two separate electronic states, induced by weak electrostatic interactions between the molecular entities represented by the states. His group attracted students from Moscow State University and the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, and foreign scientists as well; he was advisor for 13 PhD and 5 Dr.Sci. theses. Work of this group through the 1970s dealt with the relation between electron transfer and other condensed phase electronic processes such as light absorption, emphasizing processes involving three rather than two electronic levels, with low-temperature processes and with particular features characteristic of biological processes.

He and his pupils suggested the first quantum-mechanical model of proton transfer in polar solvents taking into account the dynamic role of the polar solvent, and created a well-known quantum-mechanical theory of kinetics of chemical, electrochemical and biochemical processes in polar liquids, as well as a quantum-mechanical theory of kinetics of atomic-molecular transformation in condensed media.

Dogonadze founded and was the first head (1978–1985) of the Department of Theoretical Investigations of the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Electrochemistry of the Georgian National Academy of Sciences (GNAS). In 1982-1985 he was also Head of the Department of General and Theoretical Physics of the Georgian Technical University and in 1982 was elected Corresponding Member of the GAS. In 1978-1985 he was Chairman of the Department of Electrochemical Physics of the International Society of Electrochemistry (ISE). He was a member of the editorial board of the international &quot;Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry and Interfacial Electrochemistry&quot; and the editorial board of the Russian journal &quot;Elektrokhimia&quot;.

Dogonadze organized a number of international conferences in his subject, and was author about 190 scientific research works (among them 7 monographs). Under Dogonadze&#x27;s guidance were prepared about 20 theses (13 PhD&#x27;s and 5 Dr.Sc.). He was co-editor and co-author of a three-volume collective monograph &quot;The Chemical Physics of Solvation&quot; (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1985–1986). He died in Moscow, aged 53.

Dogonadze is listed in the &quot;Electrochemical Dictionary.&quot;

<doc id="447345" wikidata="Q849474" url="?curid=447345" title="Battle of Qarqar">
<text>The Battle of Qarqar (or Ḳarḳar) was fought in 853 BC when the army of the Neo-Assyrian Empire led by Emperor Shalmaneser III encountered an allied army of eleven kings at Qarqar led by Hadadezer, called in Assyrian &quot;Adad-idir&quot; and possibly to be identified with King Benhadad II of Aram-Damascus; and Ahab, king of Israel. This battle, fought during the 854–846 BC Assyrian conquest of Aram, is notable for having a larger number of combatants than any previous battle, and for being the first instance in which some peoples enter recorded history, such as the Arabs. The battle is recorded on the Kurkh Monoliths. Using a different rescension of the Assyrian Eponym List would put the battle&#x27;s date at 854 BC.

The ancient town of Qarqar at which the battle took place has generally been identified with the modern-day archaeological site of Tell Qarqur near the village of Qarqur in Hama Governorate, northwestern Syria.

According to an inscription later erected by Shalmaneser, he had started his annual campaign, leaving Nineveh on the 14th day of Iyar. He crossed both the Tigris and Euphrates without incident, receiving the submission and tribute of several cities along the way, including Aleppo. Once past Aleppo he encountered his first resistance from troops of Irhuleni, king of the Luwian state of Ḥamā (called in Hebrew &quot;Ḥamāth&quot;), whom he defeated; in retribution, he plundered both the palaces and the cities of Irhuleni&#x27;s kingdom. Continuing his march after having sacked Qarqar, he encountered the allied forces near the Orontes River.

==Twelve kings==
&quot;Twelve Kings&quot; is an Akkadian term meant to symbolize any kind of alliance. The most famous example is in the Kurkh Monoliths, where an alliance of 11 kings are listed as 12 in the Assyrian document as fighting against Assyrian King Shalmaneser III in the battle of Qarqar. Shalmaneser&#x27;s inscription describes the forces of his opponent Hadadezer in considerable detail as follows:

#King Hadadezer himself commanded 1,200 chariots, 1,200 horsemen and 20,000 soldiers;
#King Irhuleni of Hamath commanded 700 chariots, 700 horsemen and 10,000 soldiers;
#King Ahab of Israel sent 2,000 chariots and 10,000 soldiers;
#The Kingdom of &quot;KUR Gu-a-a&quot; identified as Quwê-Cilicia sent 500 soldiers;
#The land of &quot;KUR Mu-us-ra-&quot; identified as Masura, which is the outlet of the Düden River, sent 1,000 soldiers;
#The land of Irqanata (Tell Arqa) sent 10 chariots and 10,000 soldiers;
#King Matinu Baal of Arwad sent 200 soldiers;
#The land of Usannata (in the Mount Lebanon region) sent 200 soldiers;
#King Adunu Baal of Ušnatu (in the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range) – figures lost;
#King Gindibu of Arabia sent 1,000 camel cavalry;
#King Ba&#x27;asa, son of Ruhubi, of the land of Ammon sent 100 soldiers.

The number of forces sent in by Ahab is a subject of controversy among scholars, since it seems unlikely that the Kingdom of Israel could possess an army superior to that of the Kingdom of Aram-Damascus. The number of chariots in Ahab&#x27;s forces was probably closer to a number in the hundreds (based upon archaeological excavations of the area and the foundations of stables that have been found). Although some scholars have argued that Israel under king Ahab would not have been able to muster a force of 2,000 chariots, there is some archeological evidence that supports the biblical account. Archeological excavations conducted by The Oriental Institute at Tel Meggido uncovered a large complex of stables. Some scholars suggest that these were not actually stables, but scholars such as Yadin, Finkelstein, and Ussishkin, say that they are indeed stables. The stables they uncovered housed 150 chariots and were dated to the 9th century BCE, which would align with the reign of King Ahab. If Ahab had stables of this size throughout his kingdom, it would suggest that he would be able to raise a substantial force. A building complex similar to the one at Megiddo was also uncovered at the city of Be’er Shiva. Archaeologist Nadav Na&#x27;aman believes it to be a scribal error in regard to the size of Ahab&#x27;s army and suggested that he sent 200 instead of 2,000 chariots. Another possible explanation is that the forces attributed to Ahab include those belonging to his allies, such as the Kingdom of Judah, the Kingdom of Tyre and the Kingdom of Moab, although those kingdoms are not named in the monolith.

==Battle==
The Battle according to Shalmaneser:With the supreme forces which Aššur, my lord, had given me and with the mighty weapons which the divine standard, which goes before me, had granted me, I fought with them. I decisively defeated them from the city of Qarqar to the city of Gilzau. I felt with the sword 14,000 troops, their fighting men. Like Adad, I rained down upon them a devastating flood. I spread out their corpses and I filled the plain. I felled with the sword their extensive troops. I made their blood flow in the wadis. The field was too small for laying flat their bodies; the broad countryside had been consumed in burying them. I blocked the Orontes river with their corpses as with a causeway. In the midst of the battle I took away from them chariots, cavalry, and teams of horses.

However, the royal inscriptions from this period are notoriously unreliable. They never directly acknowledge defeats and sometimes claim victories that were actually won by ancestors or predecessors. If Shalmaneser had won a clear victory at Qarqar, it did not immediately lead to further Assyrian conquests in Syria. Assyrian records make it clear that he campaigned in the region several more times in the following decade, engaging Hadadezer six times, who was supported by Irhuleni of Hama at least twice. Shalmaneser&#x27;s opponents held on to their thrones after this battle: though Ahab of Israel died shortly afterwards in an unrelated battle, Hadadezer was king of Damascus until at least 841 BC.

<text>Einojuhani Rautavaara (; 9 October 1928 – 27 July 2016) was a Finnish composer of classical music. Among the most notable Finnish composers since Jean Sibelius (1865–1957), Rautavaara wrote a great number of works spanning various styles. These include eight symphonies, nine operas and fifteen concertos, as well as numerous vocal and chamber works. Having written early works using 12-tone serial techniques, his later music may be described as neo-romantic and mystical. His major works include his first piano concerto (1969), &quot;Cantus Arcticus&quot; (1972) and his seventh symphony, &quot;Angel of Light&quot; (1994).

==Life==
Rautavaara was born in Helsinki in 1928. His father Eino Alfred Rautavaara (né Jernberg; 1876–1939; he changed his last name in 1901) was an opera singer and cantor, and his mother Elsa Katariina Rautavaara (née Teräskeli; originally Träskelin) (1898–1944) was a doctor. His early childhood was molded by the musicianship of his father, and at the encouragement of his mother, Einojuhani began to casually learn piano when he was young. His father died when Einojuhani was 10 years old, with his mother dying less than 6 years later. He went to live with his aunt Hilja Helena Teräskeli (1893–1958) in the city of Turku, where he began taking formal piano lessons at the age of 17.
Rautavaara attended the University of Helsinki to study piano and musicology, and eventually studied composition at the Sibelius Academy under Aarre Merikanto from 1948 to 1952. He first came to international attention when he won the Thor Johnson Contest for his composition &quot;A Requiem in Our Time&quot; in 1954, despite having, according to Rautavaara, &quot;...absolutely no experience of writing for brass band and [a] composition technique [that] was immature at the time...&quot; Nevertheless, the work prompted Jean Sibelius to recommend him for a scholarship to study at the Juilliard School in New York City. There he was taught by Vincent Persichetti, and he also took lessons from Roger Sessions and Aaron Copland at Tanglewood. Reflecting on his time enrolled in Juilliard, Rautavaara later said that living in Manhattan was, &quot;Maybe the most important experience, [and] taught much more about life to me than all those teachers about music.&quot; He then returned to Helsinki and graduated from the Sibelius Academy in 1957, later choosing to study further in Switzerland that same year, under the tutelage of Swiss composer Wladimir Vogel. The following year, he traveled to Cologne, Germany to study under German composer Rudolf Petzold.

Rautavaara served as a non-tenured teacher at the Sibelius Academy from 1957 to 1959, music archivist of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra from 1959 to 1961, rector of the in Helsinki from 1965 to 1966, tenured teacher at the Sibelius Academy from 1966 to 1976, artist professor (appointed by the Arts Council of Finland) from 1971 to 1976, and professor of composition at the Sibelius Academy from 1976 to 1990. Some of his more famous pupils during this era were Finnish composer Kalevi Aho and conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen. 

He married Heidi Maria &quot;Mariaheidi&quot; Suovanen, an actress, in 1959. Together they had two sons (Markojuhani and Olof) and a daughter (Yrja). They separated in 1982 and divorced in 1984, after he fell in love with Sinikka Koivisto, who was 29 years his junior. In 1984 he married Sinikka.

Rautavaara was awarded the Finnish State Prize for Music in 1985.

After an aortic dissection in January 2004, Rautavaara spent almost half a year in intensive care before recovering and continuing his work. The Finnish government gave him strong support during this time, and named him an arts professor, paying him only to compose. He died on 27 July 2016 in Helsinki from complications of hip surgery.

==Music==
Rautavaara was a prolific composer and wrote in a variety of forms and styles. His oeuvre can be broadly divided into four periods: an early &quot;neoclassical&quot; period of the 1950s, exhibiting close ties to tradition; an avant-garde and constructivist stage of the 1960s, when he experimented with serial techniques, but abandoned them later in the decade; a &quot;neo-romantic&quot; period of the late 1960s and the 1970s; and an eclectic, &quot;post-modern&quot; compositional style in which he blended a wide spectrum of stylistic techniques and genres. A recurring label given to his opus is &quot;mysticism&quot;, for his fascination with metaphysical and religious subjects and texts. (Several of his works have titles which allude to angels.) 
His compositions include eight symphonies, 15 concertos, choral works (several for unaccompanied choir, including &quot;Vigilia&quot; (1971–1972)), sonatas for various instruments, string quartets and other chamber music, and a number of biographical operas including &quot;Vincent&quot; (1986–1987, based on the life of Vincent van Gogh), &quot;Aleksis Kivi&quot; (1995–1996) and &quot;Rasputin&quot; (2001–2003).

===Compositional process===

In the performance notes of his 1999 piece &quot;Autumn Gardens&quot;, Rautavaara writes, &quot;I have often compared composing to gardening. In both processes, one observes and controls organic growth rather than constructing or assembling existing components and elements. I would also like to think that my compositions are rather like &#x27;English gardens&#x27;, freely growing and organic, as opposed to those that are pruned to geometric precision and severity.&quot;
He has also described that he would first pick the instrumentation of a piece, where the music could then &quot;grow organically&quot; as a concept.

===1960s===

Along with Erik Bergman, Rautavaara was one of the pioneers of serial composing in Finland in the early 1950s, although in the end he completed only a few serial works. His most important works from the period are the Third and Fourth Symphony, and the opera &quot;Kaivos&quot; (The Mine), which saw only a television production in 1963, but was a source of material for the string orchestra pieces &quot;Canto I&quot; (1960) and &quot;Canto II&quot; (1961), and for the Third String Quartet (1965). Even his serial works from the period carry obvious romantic and post-expressionist notes stylistically closer to Alban Berg and Anton Bruckner than more straightforward serialists such as Pierre Boulez. Rautavaara himself referred to the Third as the &quot;Bruckner symphony&quot;.

His use of these 12-tone and serialist techniques was highly uncommon in Finland at the time, allowing Rautavaara to become a controversial figure, and pushing him to the forefront of the Finnish classical music scene, alongside composers Joonas Kokkonen and Erkki Salmenhaara. In the mid-1960s, however, Rautavaara fell into a creative crisis with serialism, realizing that the composition method was immensely laborious and its distance from the outcome too large. He later recalled that &quot;...the modernism of that time, [...] that is the serialism in music, which I had experimented with, [...] was not a road for me to follow.&quot; He experimented and found a resolution towards the end of the decade, when he began to explore different styles as he had earlier done in the Third Symphony. The Bach-influenced &quot;Cello Concerto No.1&quot; (1968) and Debussy-influenced &quot;Anadyomene&quot; (1968) opened his creative deadlock. More eclectic works started to emerge, whose style loans and compositional techniques over time became characteristic of his style. Its hallmarks included three-chord-based, often modal harmonies, ringing softly romantic orchestrals, modernism springing from the new play modes, and finally the return of the twelve-tone passages embedded into the musical texture.

===1970s===
The 1970s were Rautavaara&#x27;s most productive period. According to Rautavaara, it was during this period that he had discovered a &quot;synthesis&quot; and until that point he was merely a student, collecting information on various styles and techniques. In a short time he composed an extensive body of music, most of which has withstood the test of time. The softly-sounding new style was noticed by choirs, who commissioned a number of choral songs from the composer. His major choral works &quot;Vigilia&quot; and &quot;True and False Unicorn&quot; were made during 1971. &quot;Cantus Arcticus&quot; followed immediately after, in the beginning of 1972, and in the summer he composed an extensive score for male choir, &quot;A Book of Life&quot;.

In the 1970s Rautavaara started working more extensively on operas. The comical opera-musical &quot;Apollo contra Marsyas&quot;, made in 1970 in cooperation with librettist turned out to be a disappointment. After that, based on motifs from the Kalevala, he composed &quot;The Myth of Sampo&quot; (1974–1983) and &quot;Marjatta, lowly maiden&quot; (1975). His mature style in operas was exhibited later, in &quot;Thomas&quot; (1985); subsequently &quot;Vincent&quot; (1987) and &quot;The House of the Sun&quot; (1991) earned him notable international success. His later operas include &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; (1994), &quot;Aleksis Kivi&quot; (1997) and &quot;Rasputin&quot; (2003).

A number of his works have parts for magnetic tape, including &quot;Cantus Arcticus&quot; (1972, also known as &quot;Concerto for Birds &amp; Orchestra&quot;) for taped bird song and orchestra, and &quot;True and False Unicorn&quot; (1971, second version 1974, revised 2001–02), the final version of which is for three reciters, choir, orchestra and tape.

===1980s and 1990s===
In the late 1970s, Rautavaara gradually turned toward stylistic synthesis, evident in the Organ Concerto &quot;Annunciations&quot; (1977) and the Violin Concerto (1977), and especially in &quot;Angels and Visitations&quot; (1978) for orchestra. It is the first in the &quot;Angel&quot; series, which also includes the Fifth Symphony, whose working title was &quot;Monologue with Angels&quot;, the double-bass concerto &quot;Angel of Dusk&quot; from 1980, and the Seventh Symphony &quot;Angel of Light&quot;.

His opera &quot;Thomas&quot; (1985) marked the beginning of his mature operatic style, combining neo-Romantic harmonies with aleatoric counterpoint, twelve-tone rows and different modal systems. The libretto, written by Rautavaara himself, tells the story of a 13th-century Bishop of Finland as experienced by the protagonist himself, again using Kalevala motifs. A similar first-person narrative is used in the next opera &quot;Vincent&quot; (1987) devoted to Vincent van Gogh. Along with &quot;The House of the Sun&quot; (1991), the operas earned him notable international success.

His most widely acclaimed work, the Seventh Symphony, earned a Cannes Classical Award and a Grammy nomination for the recording by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Leif Segerstam.

Apart from the &quot;Angel of Light&quot;, his notable instrumental works from the period include the Sixth Symphony &quot;Vincentiana&quot; (1992), based on &quot;Vincent&quot;; the Third Piano Concerto &quot;Gift of Dreams&quot; (1998), commissioned by Vladimir Ashkenazy; the orchestral work &quot;Autumn Gardens&quot; (1998), commissioned by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra; and the Eighth Symphony &quot;The Journey&quot;, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra. 

===2000s===
Rautavaara&#x27;s later works include the orchestral works &quot;Book of Visions&quot; (2003–2005), &quot;Manhattan Trilogy&quot; (2003–2005) and &quot;Before the Icons&quot; (2005), which is an expanded version of his early piano work &quot;Icons&quot;. In 2005 he finished a work for violin and piano called &quot;Lost Landscapes&quot;, commissioned by the violinist Midori Goto. His orchestral work &quot;A Tapestry of Life&quot; was premiered by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra in April 2008, directed by Pietari Inkinen. Rautavaara wrote a percussion concerto called &quot;Incantations&quot; for Colin Currie in 2008 and a second cello concerto &quot;Towards the Horizon&quot; for Truls Mørk in 2009.

===2010s===

In 2010 Rautavaara&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; was commissioned and performed by the men and boys choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (UK) for their annual Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols. In 2011 Rautavaara completed two larger-scale compositions: &quot;Missa a Cappella&quot; (premiered in the Netherlands, November 2011) and a work for string orchestra, &quot;Into the Heart of Light&quot;, which premiered in September 2012.
His last major work for violin and orchestra, entitled Fantasia, was commissioned by violinist Anne Akiko Meyers and recorded with the Philharmonia Orchestra, and released after his death in 2016. It was premiered with the Helsinki Philharmonic with his widow and son in attendance in December 2018. Rautavaara did not live to see the first opera stage première of &quot;Kaivos&quot;, the uncensored version, which took place 21 October 2016 in Budapest, Hungary.

Manuscripts of two serenades for violin and orchestra (&quot;Deux Sérénades&quot;) were presented by his widow to conductor Mikko Franck after his funeral. The serenades are titled &quot;Sérénade pour mon amour&quot; (Serenade to My Love) and &quot;Sérénade pour la vie&quot; (Serenade to Life). The first of the two was completed, while only the solo violin part for the second was completed, with sketches for the orchestra. Kalevi Aho, Rautavaara&#x27;s student, completed its orchestration. The two serenades were written for violinist Hilary Hahn and were premiered in February 2019 by the violinist and the Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France under Franck&#x27;s direction. In the studio album titled &quot;Paris&quot; released in March 2021, the serenades were recorded with the same artists, along with Ernest Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Poème for Violin and Orchestra&quot; and Sergey Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto No.1&quot;.

<doc id="447357" wikidata="Q1413485" url="?curid=447357" title="Tactics Ogre">
<text>is a 1995 tactical role-playing game developed and published by Quest Corporation for the Super Famicom. It was later ported to the Sega Saturn (1996) and the PlayStation (1997), the latter released in North America in 1998 by Atlus USA. The second entry in the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; series, the story takes place in the war-torn kingdom of Valeria, where protagonist Denim Powell works in a local resistance force against occupying powers, ending up caught in the ethnic conflicts driving the war. Battles are turn-based, taking place on grid-based maps from an overhead perspective with a focus on positioning and using character class abilities.

Production lasted two and a half years, with &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; creator Yasumi Matsuno acting as director, writer and lead designer. The storyline was inspired by conflicts in Europe and Asia, based heavily in personal and political drama over the fantasy-themed narrative of &quot;Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen&quot;. The gameplay, inspired by the video game &quot;Solstice&quot;, uses a chess-inspired combat system in contrast with the real-time battles of its predecessor. Hiroshi Minagawa was art director, while the characters were designed by Akihiko Yoshida. The music, composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata, used the narrative as inspiration and remains fondly remembered by the composers.

The Super Famicom release sold 500,000 units in Japan and met with positive reviews. Later ports also met with strong sales and reviews, with many praising its gameplay and narrative. The PlayStation version was met with criticism for technical issues. It has since been remembered as one of the best in its genre. Matsuno left Quest Corporation after completing &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, joining Square (later Square Enix) and developing &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; (1997) and other titles set within its universe of Ivalice. Quest developed further titles in the series before being absorbed by Square in 2003. A remake of the same name for the PlayStation Portable was released in 2010.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together&quot; is a tactical role-playing game in which players take on the role of Denim Powell (renamable by the player), a soldier caught in the middle of a war in the nation of Valeria. The player moves between nodes on a worldmap, triggering story events followed by either a single battle or sequences of battles. Beginning the game, the player is asked to input the lead character&#x27;s name, birthday, and answer a series of questions determining their alignment and statistics. Each movement on the world map equates to a single in-game day, which alters weather conditions. Prior to battles, the player can equip their preferred units with chosen weapons, armor, items and accessories. Also included is a training mode, where the player controls both sides of a battle and can raise unit strength. This mode allows for two-person multiplayer in the Super Famicom release.

The game uses a turn-based battle system dubbed the Non-Alternate Turn System. Battles and all actions within take place on a small map viewed from an overhead diagonal perspective, with spaces and level geography appearing as a square grid structure. The player team has a maximum of ten units on the field, and a maximum of thirty in their army. The enemy team and allied characters are controlled by the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence. A unit has a set range of movement, and an attack range dictated by their position on the map. Turn order is dictated by a unit&#x27;s Wait Turn (WT) points, which fluctuate depending on how many and what type of action is taken, with a unit&#x27;s weight and agility statistic impacting how many WT are gained each turn. When an enemy is defeated, a tarot card can randomly drop, able to bestow a temporary boost to a character. After a stage&#x27;s victory condition is met, units can raise their experience level during battle. If Denim is killed, the game ends and must be restarted from an earlier save point.

Units have a variety of commands including moving, attacking with either melee or ranged weapons, performing a spell if they are capable of magic once their magic has charged enough during battle, using an item, or performing a character-specific special move. An ability unique to the lead character is &quot;Persuade&quot;, which has a chance of recruiting enemy units in battle. The terrain and weather conditions impact how a unit can move and act in each battle. Unit behavior is also influenced by their alignment to the story path, and their associated elemental affinity which impacts unit compatibility and can enhance attacks or other actions. An important feature is character classes with dedicated abilities, which can be evolved into more powerful classes through use in battle and transferred to compatible characters.

A key element to progress is branching story paths, labelled as &quot;Law&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot; and &quot;Chaos&quot;, built around the lead character either accepting or rejecting the commands of authority figures. Some characters will also live or die depending on these choices, represented through dialogue options during cutscenes. The narrative&#x27;s branches occur in its first three chapters, with events coming back together for the final chapter&#x27;s events before playing out an ending based on earlier decisions. Up to eight different ending variations can be unlocked. Character biographies and events both from cutscenes and beyond the revealed storyline are detailed in a separate menu named the Warren Report after one of the game&#x27;s characters.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; takes place in Valeria, an archipelago united as a single kingdom under King Dolgare and worshipping a pantheon of six elemental gods, together with the Light Goddess Ishtar and the Chaos God Asmodeus. After Dolgare&#x27;s apparent death with no direct heirs, the three primary ethnic groups of Valeria end up in a brief civil war, dividing into dedicated territories of varying sizes. The factions are Bacrum-Valeria, backed by the foreign nation of Lodis and ruled by its regent, Bishop Branta Mown; the Galgastan Kingdom led by Cardinal Barbatos; and the Walsta People led by Duke Ronway. After Galgastan gains the upper hand and declares itself ruler of Valeria, the neighbouring Walista are subjected to persecution and restricted to a small island.

The story opens with a small Walsta resistance group−Denim Powell, his sister Kachua, and his childhood friend Vice Bozek−attack a group of roaming Zenobian mercenaries falsely believing their leader Lans Hamilton is the Black Knight Lans Tartare, a Lodis soldier who imprisoned Denim and Kachua&#x27;s father Plancy in their childhood. The sympathetic Hamilton joins the group, bringing the old sage Warren, and Kachua vainly attempts to dissuade Denim from fighting. Denim&#x27;s loyalty to the resistance is tested when Ronway orders the massacre of a town that refuses to join them, framing Gargastan for the crime. Whether Denim agrees or refuses the order, Vice disagrees and opposes him. If he rebels, Denim can later reconcile with Ronway or continue his own path. Following this Vice either becomes a fugitive for disagreeing with Denim&#x27;s return, or secretly allies with Bacrum for his own ends as he serves Ronway.

Eventually finding Plancy dying from a terminal illness, Plancy tells Denim he is of the Mown family, and Kachua is Dolgare&#x27;s illegitimate daughter, giving her a direct claim to Valeria&#x27;s throne. By this point, the revelations regarding their bloodline and the constant danger for Denim strain his relationship with Kachua, leading her to briefly join Tartare&#x27;s forces. If Denim does not comfort her, she commits suicide. Hamilton is captured and tortured by Tartare during this period, and while rescued Hamilton is left crippled and mentally traumatized. Gargastan is conquered and Barbatos dies either by suicide or execution. In all routes, Ronway&#x27;s complicity in the massacre is revealed, leading to his assassination by his own people. Tartare&#x27;s forces are defeated and Denim kills Branta Mown. Survivors of Tartare&#x27;s Dark Knights use the stolen Zenobian sword Brunhild to break the seal on a portal leading to the realm of Asmodeus, attempting to use its power to repel Denim&#x27;s forces but are instead killed.

It is revealed that Dolgare, overcome with despair over the death of his wife, made a pact with Asmodeus in an attempt to resurrect her and became an Ogre, one of humanity&#x27;s ancient enemies. Dolgare attempts to return to reclaim Valeria, but Denim&#x27;s forces defeat Dolgare and Warren sacrifices himself to seal the portal. Depending on Denim&#x27;s actions and Kachua&#x27;s fate, either Kachua is crowned queen and unites the groups in a time of peace, or Denim is crowned king and either sees Valeria conquered by Lodis or is assassinated during his inaugural speech by a Gargastan. Vice&#x27;s fate varies depending on the route, either surviving as Kachua&#x27;s ally, dying after killing Ronway, or being executed by Bacrum-Valeria to protect Branta Mown. In all endings, Hamilton is left in Valeria, his surviving forces return to Zenobia with Brunhild, and Tartare escapes back to Lodis.

==Development==

The production of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; began at series developer and publisher Quest Corporation following the unexpected commercial success of &quot;Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen&quot; upon its 1993 release. The concept for &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; was in place by 1992, though Matsuno&#x27;s team had begun work on an untitled 3D action title which was abandoned when Quest Corporation requested a sequel to &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;. Matsuno created a multi-page detailed proposal for the game, with it taking a few months to get the project started at Quest. During this period, frustration with Quest&#x27;s corporate structure had convinced Matsuno to eventually leave, but he decided to complete &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;. Matsuno acted as the game&#x27;s director, designer and writer. Production, including later delays, lasted two and a half years, involving a team of fifteen to sixteen people.

Hiroshi Minagawa acted as art director, creating the sprites, effects and user interface, while Akihiko Yoshida created the new character designs and level backgrounds along with character portraits. The latter job was very difficult due to color limitations on the console. Minagawa used the character sprites from &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; as a base for the character animations. Yoshida&#x27;s more realistic character designs following the &quot;Disney-like&quot; designs of &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; were Matsuno&#x27;s choice and emerged naturally during production. Matsuno wanted Yoshida to base the character faces on notable actors of the time, such as requesting Hamilton be based on Kevin Costner from &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. Yoshida ignored the instructions and created original designs, which Matsuno eventually accepted. Memory limitations were a constant issue, with walking and running animations being the only ones that could be on-screen at all times.

The switch from real-time to turn-based tactics was born from Matsuno&#x27;s boredom with the first game&#x27;s systems, a situation he compared to the differing paces and audiences for &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;. He also wanted to fill a gap in the gaming landscape, creating a more approachable alternative to the notoriously difficult &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series. The quarter-view perspective was directly inspired by &quot;Solstice&quot;, a game Minagawa enjoyed. Minagawa created a prototype design which he showed Matsuno, which formed the technical foundation for &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;. The 3D-style levels were created using the custom-built Hermit technology, which could create large-scale levels based on positional data using a small amount of system memory. This allowed for more detailed graphic elements and for the time complex character animations. The battle system was inspired by chess. The magic system, which started with an empty magic meter that charged over time, was chosen to represent the great power of magic in the game&#x27;s world.

===Scenario===
While &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; is a broad tale focused on a high fantasy battle between good and evil, Matsuno disliked the result. He wrote &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; as a complex dark fantasy political tale focusing less on supernatural elements. He wanted people to be immersed in a foreign setting, basing the world&#x27;s history on the Middle Ages and its population and society on the Roman Empire. To help with creating the background, Matsuno bought a book on world mythology. Inspired by the acceptance of involved storylines with the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Matsuno decided to create a &quot;thoroughly written scenario&quot;. The initial pitch included the first chapter&#x27;s narrative split, a conversation scene between Hamilton and Tartare, and Hamilton&#x27;s fate. The scene between Hamilton and Tartare was written to convey the game&#x27;s narrative themes of asking the meaning of justice and the reason people fight. Story, system and tutorial text totalled 300,000 characters, the memory for which had been set aside at the start of production with a large scenario in mind. The limitations of the Super Famicom led Matsuno to stage the narrative scenes like a theatrical play.

&quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; was designed as the seventh chapter of a larger narrative dubbed the &quot;Ogre Battle Saga&quot;. While &quot;March of the Black Queen&quot; was the fifth chapter, Matsuno felt the gameplay of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; was a poor fit for the sixth chapter which would have directly continued the first game&#x27;s narrative. &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; runs parallel to the planned events of the sixth chapter. When it was decided to use the same world, characters from &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; such as Hamilton were incorporated into the narrative. The narrative was influenced by a number of real-life conflicts and war crimes, including territorial clashes in Syria, Azerbaijan and Armenia, the Yugoslav Wars, and the Rwandan genocide. The portrayal of ethnic conflict was fairly rare in Japanese games of the time. He was also inspired by major events of his life in Europe including the fall of the Berlin Wall, which were beginning to see regular broadcast on Japanese television. Rather than focusing only on ethnicity, Matsuno wrote the scenario to show how a conflict based on any differences between groups could be resolved. The implementation of multiple story routes was inspired by sound novels and gamebooks of the time.

The originally-planned protagonist was Hamilton, but after Matsuno created the character of Denim he focused the story around him. Denim&#x27;s and Vice&#x27;s names were respectively inspired by the material denim and the clothing brand Levi&#x27;s, connecting to their origin in the world&#x27;s lower social ranks. Following this logic, Kachua was not given a similar name, denoting her higher social status. Kachua&#x27;s emotional instability and obsession with Denim was designed to contrast starkly against many fantasy heroines of the time, being compared to the later-common &quot;tsundere&quot; and &quot;yandere&quot; anime archetypes. Matsuno found idealized heroines boring due to overuse in media, wanting a more complex female lead. The Zenobian mercenaries were featured as they were early characters in &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; and players would empathise with them. During their inclusion, Matsuno made character adjustments, particularly to the character Canopus so he would appear as a big brother figure. While originally considering the Chaos route to be the canon series of events, he later summarized the endings as alternate coexisting timelines with no &quot;correct&quot; choice. Matsuno originally planned for more divergence in the story paths, but memory limitations meant these and other systems relating to unit loyalty were trimmed down. The variations in Denim&#x27;s endings as Valeria&#x27;s king were dictated by a hidden algorithm of how the different factions viewed Denim, a version of &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;″s Chaos Frame. A cheat was included in the final game to show it through the Warren Report screen, but Matsuno lost the memo describing it and was only found by fans in 2014 through data mining.

===Music===
The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata, who had previously worked on the first &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;. While the music of &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; had been lighter to match its narrative tone, the music for &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; adopted a darker and more dramatic style. It was Sakimoto&#x27;s first time creating orchestra-style music, learning to create equivalent sounds to a live orchestra using synthesizers. &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; required a lot more work from Sakimoto than &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;, and he remembered putting all his heart into the compositions. Iwata described his work on the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; series overall as a chance to change his musical style, citing &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; as his favorite from the period.

A soundtrack album, featuring the original sound tracks on the first disc and in-game midi versions on the other two discs, was published by Datam Polystar on October 25, 1995. Tracks from &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; were featured in the compilation album &quot;Ogre: Grand Repeat&quot;, published by Datam Polystar on October 25, 1996.

==Release==
&quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; was released in Japan on October 6, 1995, eighteen months after its initial announcement due to Matsuno wanting further polish in the character animations. The game&#x27;s subtitle was inspired by the song of the same name by British rock band Queen. Minagawa later said that Matsuno&#x27;s love of Queen and sadness at the death of Freddie Mercury led to numerous Queen references in the game. A demo was broadcast shortly before release on the Super Famicom&#x27;s Satellaview peripheral. The game was also distributed through the Nintendo Power flash cartridge. It was compatible with ASCII Corporation&#x27;s Turbo File, allowing save data transfer between systems. This version was re-released in Japan for Virtual Console on the Wii U on January 30, 2009. A Virtual Console version for New Nintendo 3DS was released on November 21, 2016.

It was ported to and published on the Sega Saturn by Riverhillsoft on December 13, 1996. The port was produced by Junji Shigematsu, who also supervised the porting of the original &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; to the platform. A priority was ensuring the game ran with minimal lag, which was a potential issue caused by the new CD storage. The Saturn release included voices for selected story sequences from a cast of seventeen actors. Among them were Nozomu Sasaki (Denim), Yumi Tōma (Kachua) and Toshihiko Seki (Vice). The voice work was managed by Kazuhiko Inoue. Further unique music was also created for the different endings. Promotional items were made available on the game&#x27;s release, such as metal figures of some key characters, as well as stickers for the Sega Saturn Backup Memory cartridge.

A PlayStation port was developed by Kuusou Kagaku and published by Artdink on September 25, 1997. Artdink reissued this version in Japan on December 2, 2000. Atlus USA published the PlayStation version for North America, riding on the commercial success of the PlayStation version of the original &quot;Ogre Battle&quot;. It was released in North America on May 6, 1998, dropping the original subtitle. The localization had been completed earlier than this, but Atlus chose to delay the release both to minimize competition with &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, and to target players which &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; would introduce to the genre. The localization was impacted due to strict word limitations on the old hardware. This version was never released in Europe.

Multiple guidebooks were published in Japan for the various versions of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;. The Super Famicom guides were published by Aspect Co. and Shueisha, the Saturn guide by Shufunotomo, and the PlayStation guides were published by Zest. A downloadable art collection was published for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh by Quest parent company Bothtec. It was also adapted into a manga series published by Enix, a gag comic anthology published by Studio DNA, and a further anthology published by Enix with a cover illustration by Akihiro Yamada. The Super Famicom original was never released outside Japan, a fact attributed to the console&#x27;s waning lifespan, its complexity in narrative and mechanics, and a lack of interest from Western players. A fan translation of the Super Famicom version, which transcribed the PlayStation script using a patch, was released by translation group Aeon Genesis on April 25, 2010. A fan translation of the Saturn version, which transcribed the PlayStation Portable script, was released on February 27, 2023.

==Reception==

The Super Famicom release has sold over 500,000 copies in Japan. The Saturn version had sold over 70,000 units by February 1997, making it one of the console&#x27;s best sellers at the time. During its release month, Western PlayStation release ranked ninth in EB Games PlayStation sales charts. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a Gold Award as part of its review. Review aggregate website &quot;GameRankings&quot; gave the PlayStation release a score of just over 81%, based on six reviews.

&quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the implementation of the narrative into the gameplay. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the narrative as easy to follow compared to &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; and noted its multiple endings, while a retrospective review from &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Gonçalo Lopes praised the story as &quot;anything but [cliche]&quot;. Bryan Boulette of &quot;RPGamer&quot; gave extensive praise to the narrative, citing it as one of the best stories within the medium. Jeremy Tan of &quot;RPGFan&quot; was also fairly positive about the narrative due to its tone and variation, and magazine &quot;PlayStation Extreme&quot; lauded it as better than that of &quot;Tactics&quot;.

The &quot;Famitsu&quot; reviewers praised the gameplay in general, but some faulted its high difficulty causing the training area to become almost mandatory. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised it as a solid and enjoyable gameplay experience. &quot;GamePro&quot; praised its gameplay as more diverse, comparing it to the more complex but narrower gameplay approach of &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;. Peter Bartholow of &quot;GameSpot&quot; lauded the gameplay as enjoyable, noting its long playtime for each of its story routes. &quot;Game Informer&quot; praised the amount of randomness in gameplay created by its narrative branches and questions during the opening section, in addition to the amount of options for unit customization. Lopes gave praise to the gameplay despite its age on the original hardware, Tan noted and enjoyed the simplicity of its unit customization compared to other titles including &quot;Tactics&quot;, while &quot;PlayStation Extreme&quot; enjoyed the gameplay&#x27;s approach to combat despite noting a lack of pacing and some repetition later in the game. French magazine &quot;Joypad&quot; noted that the game would give players hours of enjoyment due its complexity and length.

The graphics were praised in general by both &quot;Famitsu&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot;, though the latter faulted the sound effects for their minimal use. Lopes also noted the small usage of sound effects, but praised the graphics and art direction. These sentiments were echoed by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and Tan, who additionally praised its musical score. &quot;Game Informer&quot; also noted a lack of graphical power compared to &quot;Tactics&quot;. Bartholow was fairly negative about the graphics, finding them dated compared to other titles on the platform. &quot;PlayStation Extreme&quot; was fairly mixed on the audio and graphics due to their age and origins on the Super Famicom. &quot;Joypad&quot; negatively noted the lack of extras and language options.

Both &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; and &quot;RPGamer&quot; gave different versions of the Super Famicom original perfect scores. Both &quot;Famitsu&quot; and Japanese publication &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; praised the Saturn version, noting the inclusion of voice acting. &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s review of the PlayStation port praised it as a faithful adaptation of the Super Famicom original. The PlayStation version was faulted by Western reviewers for technical issues including frame rate drops, loading times and bugs.

The Super Famicom version was awarded Best Import Strategy Game of 1995 by gaming magazine &quot;GameFan&quot;. In March 2006, the Japanese &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine readers voted on their 100 all-time favorite games, and &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; was named number seven. In 2017, &quot;IGN&quot; placed &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; as the 20th best RPG of all time, citing the mature themes, and multiple story paths and endings. In 2019, &quot;Famitsu&quot; conducted a poll of over 7000 readers to determine the best games of the Heisei era (1989-2019), with &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; placing 15th. In a retrospective of tactical RPGs for the PlayStation, &quot;1Up.com&quot; ranked &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; as one of the best available at the time. A later retrospective of the game from the same website praised it as an innovator in the genre for its narrative and gameplay, but let down by a lack of accessibility outside Japan aside from the PlayStation port. Kat Bailey of &quot;USgamer&quot; praised its innovations for the time and mature storytelling compared to many other titles both in the genre and in general gaming. Kimberley Wallace of &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked it among the top ten best tactical RPGs, referencing its PlayStation Portable remake as an accessible means of enjoying the game.

==Legacy==

Matsuno left Quest in 1995 once &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; was completed, eventually joining Square (later Square Enix). Together with a number of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; staff members who followed him, he developed &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; (1997) for the PlayStation. &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; proved a success, and Matsuno went on to create multiple titles set within its fictional universe of Ivalice including &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; (2000) and &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot; (2007). The latter would be his final project for Square Enix, as he departed the company in 2005 citing ill health, though he would return in later years to collaborate with Square Enix on a freelance basis. Banri Oda, a lead scenario writer for &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, cited &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; as a direct influence on his storytelling for the expansion &quot;Shadowbringers&quot;.

While he left Quest after completing &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, Matsuno had been planning a third &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; title which would blend gameplay elements from the first &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; and &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; into a mainstream experience. Quest continued production of the &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; series until 2003, when they were absorbed by Square following the completion and release of &quot;Tactics Ogre: The Knight of Lodis&quot;, a spin-off prequel to &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, going on to develop titles in the &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; subseries. Minagawa would reassemble most of the original staff, including Matsuno, for a PlayStation Portable remake of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot;, released in 2010 in Japan and 2011 in the West. Released under its original title in the West and with the subtitle &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in Japan, it received an expanded narrative, redesigned gameplay, artistic changes, graphical upgrades, and a new localization. A new update of the game was released on November 11, 2022, &quot;Tactics Ogre Reborn&quot;. &quot;Reborn&quot; was based on the PSP version, but with further changes and adjustments to graphics and mechanics. It was made available for PC, Playstation 4 &amp; 5, and Nintendo Switch.

<doc id="447367" wikidata="Q2458522" url="?curid=447367" title="Palatine Chapel, Aachen">
<text>The Palatine Chapel in Aachen is an early medieval chapel and remaining component of Charlemagne&#x27;s Palace of Aachen in what is now Germany. Although the palace itself no longer exists, the chapel was preserved and now forms the central part of Aachen Cathedral. It is Aachen&#x27;s major landmark and a central monument of the Carolingian Renaissance. The chapel held the remains of Charlemagne. Later it was appropriated by the Ottonians and coronations were held there from 936 to 1531.

As part of Aachen Cathedral, the chapel is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
Charlemagne began the construction of the Palatine Chapel around 792, along with the building of the rest of the palace structures. It was consecrated in 805 by Pope Leo III in honour of the Virgin Mary. The building is a centrally planned, domed chapel. The east end had a square apse, and was originally flanked by two basilican structures, now lost but known through archaeology. The chapel was entered through a monumental atrium, to the west. The plan and decoration of the building combines elements of Classical, Byzantine and Pre-Romanesque, and opulent materials as the expression of a new royal house, ruled by Charlemagne.

The architect responsible, Odo of Metz, is named in a tenth-century inscription around the dome: &quot;Insignem hanc dignitatis aulam Karolus caesar magnus instituit; egregius Odo magister explevit, Metensi fotus in urbe quiescit&quot;. Nothing more is known of him. The building he designed has a simple exterior and a complex interior, with a double shell octagonal dome resting on heavy piers, a two-story elevation, and elaborate revetment and decoration.

In 936 Otto I, the first Holy Roman Emperor of the Ottonian dynasty, took advantage of the chapel&#x27;s close association with Charlemagne and held his coronation as King of Germany there. Holy Roman Emperors continued to be crowned in the Palatine Chapel until 1531. In 1000, in what was most likely a symbolic exhibition, Otto III placed the tomb of Charlemagne in the chapel and paid homage to his remains. The original tomb was probably a sepulchral niche, afterwards known as the &quot;Karlsmemorie&quot;, but destroyed in 1788.

==Structure==


There is a sixteen-sided ambulatory with a gallery overhead encircling the central octagonal dome. The plan and decoration owe much to the sixth-century Basilica of San Vitale, Ravenna. Indeed, Charlemagne visited Ravenna three times, the first in 787. In that year he wrote to Pope Hadrian I and requested &quot;mosaic, marbles, and other materials from floors and walls&quot; in Rome and Ravenna, for his palace.

The construction, including barrel and groin vaults and an octagonal cloister-vault in the dome, reflects late Roman, or Pre-Romanesque, practices rather than the Byzantine techniques employed at San Vitale, and its plan simplifies the complex geometry of the Ravenna building. Multi-coloured marble veneer is used to create a sumptuous interior. The chapel makes use of ancient spolia, conceivably from Ravenna (Einhard claimed they were from Rome and Ravenna), as well as newly carved materials. The bronze decoration is of extraordinarily high quality, especially the doors with lions heads and the interior railings, with their Corinthian order columns and acanthus scrolls.

The dome was decorated originally with a fresco, and later with mosaic. In the Baroque period, it was replaced by stucco. The original mosaic was reproduced in the 19th century with the same iconography as the original. It depicts the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse bearing crowns and standing around the base of the dome. Above the main altar, and facing the royal throne, is an image of Christ in Majesty. The upper gallery of the chapel was the royal space, with a special throne area for the king, then emperor, which let onto the liturgical space of the church and onto the atrium outside as well.

The inscription above the ground floor archer reads: &quot;CUM LAPIDES VIVI PACIS CONPAGE LIGANTUR INQUE PARES NUMEROS OMNIA CONVENIENT CLARET OPUS DOMINI, TOTAM QUI CONSTRUIT AULAM EFFECTUSQUE PIIS DAT STUDIIS HOMINUM QUORUM PERFECTUI DECORIS STRUCTURA MANEBIT SI PERFECTA AUCTOR PROTEGAT ATQUE REGAT SIC DEUS HOC TUTUM STABILI FUNDAMINE TEMPLUM QUOD PRINCEPS CAROLUS CONDIDIT ESSE VELIT&quot;.

The main entrance is dominated by a westwork comprising the western facade including the entrance vestibule, rooms at one or more levels above, and one or more towers. These overlook the atrium of the church. The addition of a westwork to churches is one of the Carolingian contributions to Western architectural traditions.

The bronze doors symbolize the Carolingian Renaissance in metalwork, on a scale not seen since the Roman Empire.

<doc id="447379" wikidata="Q15631700" url="?curid=447379" title="Nazi concentration camp badge">
<text>Nazi concentration camp badges, primarily triangles, were part of the system of identification in German camps. They were used in the concentration camps in the German-occupied countries to identify the reason the prisoners had been placed there. The triangles were made of fabric and were sewn on jackets and trousers of the prisoners. These mandatory badges of shame had specific meanings indicated by their colour and shape. Such emblems helped guards assign tasks to the detainees. For example, a guard at a glance could see if someone was a convicted criminal (green patch) and thus likely of a tough temperament suitable for &quot;kapo&quot; duty.

Someone with an escape suspect mark usually would not be assigned to work squads operating outside the camp fence. Someone wearing an F could be called upon to help translate guards&#x27; spoken instructions to a trainload of new arrivals from France. Some historical monuments quote the badge-imagery, with the use of a triangle being a sort of visual shorthand to symbolize all camp victims.

The modern-day use of a pink triangle emblem to symbolize gay rights is a response to the camp identification patches.

== Badge coding system ==

The system of badges varied between the camps and in the later stages of World War II the use of badges dwindled in some camps and became increasingly accidental in others. The following description is based on the badge coding system used before and during the early stages of the war in the Dachau concentration camp, which had one of the more elaborate coding systems.

Shape was chosen by analogy with the common triangular road hazard signs in Germany that denote warnings to motorists. Here, a triangle is called inverted because its base is up while one of its angles points down.

=== Single triangles ===
* Red triangle – political prisoners: occupied country resistance members (partisans), social democrats, liberals, socialists, communists, anarchists, gentiles who assisted Jews; trade unionists, and Freemasons.
* Green triangle – convicts and criminals (often working as &quot;kapos&quot;).
* Blue triangle – foreign forced laborers and emigrants. This category included statelessness people (&quot;apatrides&quot;), Spanish refugees from Francoist Spain whose citizenship was revoked and emigrants to countries which were occupied by Nazi Germany or were under German sphere of influence.
* Purple triangle – primarily Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (over 99%) as well as members of other small pacifist religious groups.
* Pink triangle – primarily homosexual men and those who were identified as such at the time (e.g., bisexual men, male prostitutes, and those deemed &#x27;transvestites&#x27;) and sexual offenders as well as pedophiles and zoophiles. Many in this group were subject to forced sterilization.
* Black triangle – people who were deemed asocial elements () and work-shy (), including the following:
** Roma and Sinti. They wore the black triangle with a Z notation (for , meaning Gypsy) to the right of the triangle&#x27;s point. Roma were later assigned a brown triangle.
** Mentally ill and developmentally disabled. Their triangles were additionally inscribed with the word , meaning stupid. This category included, notably, autistic people among this group. Though many others including schizophrenic and epileptic people were forcibly sterilized, shot, or gassed in psychiatric institutions as opposed to at the Nazi camps.
** Alcoholics and drug addicts.
** Vagrants and beggars.
** Pacifists and conscription resisters.
** Sex workers.
** Lesbians.
**Other disabled people, such as people with diabetes (as &quot;Diabetes was conceptualized as a Jewish disease not necessarily because its prevalence was high among this population, but because medicine, science, and culture reinforced each other&quot;). 
* Brown triangle – Assigned to Roma later on in the Romani Holocaust.
* Uninverted red triangle – an enemy POW (, meaning special detainee), a spy or traitor (, meaning activities detainee), or a military deserter or criminal (, meaning Armed Forces member).

=== Double triangles ===
Double-triangle badges resembled two superimposed triangles forming a Star of David, a Jewish symbol.
* Red inverted triangle superimposed upon a yellow one representing a Jewish political prisoner.
* Blue inverted triangle superimposed upon a red one representing foreign forced labour and political prisoner (for example, Spanish Republicans in Mauthausen).
* Green inverted triangle superimposed upon a yellow one representing a Jewish habitual criminal.
* Purple inverted triangle superimposed upon a yellow one representing a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness of Jewish descent.
* Pink inverted triangle superimposed upon a yellow one representing a Jewish &quot;sexual offender&quot;, typically a gay or bisexual man.
* Black inverted triangle superimposed upon a yellow one representing an &quot;asocial&quot; or work-shy Jew.
* Voided black inverted triangle superimposed over a yellow triangle representing a Jew convicted of miscegenation and labelled as a (race defiler).
* Yellow inverted triangle superimposed over a black triangle representing an &quot;Aryan&quot; woman convicted of miscegenation and labelled as a (race defiler).
Like those who wore pink and green triangles, people in the bottom two categories would have been convicted in criminal courts.

=== Distinguishing marks ===

In addition to color-coding, non-German prisoners were marked by the first letter of the German name for their home country or ethnic group. Red triangle with a letter, for example:

* B (, Belgians)
* E (, &quot;English&quot;; in practice used for all British)
* F (, French)
* I (, Italians)
* J (, Yugoslavs)
* N (, Dutch)
* No (, Norwegian)
* P (, Poles)
* S (, Republican Spanish)
* T (, Czechs)
* U (, Hungarians)
* Z notation next to a black triangle (, Gypsy).
Polish emigrant laborers originally wore a purple diamond with a yellow backing. A letter P (for ) was cut out of the purple cloth to show the yellow backing beneath.

Furthermore, repeat offenders (, meaning recidivists) would receive bars over their stars or triangles, a different colour for a different crime.
* A political prisoner would have a red bar over their star or triangle.
* A professional criminal would have a green bar.
* A foreign forced laborer would not have a blue bar (as their impressment was for the duration of the war), but might have a different coloured bar if they were drawn from another pool of inmates.
* A Jehovah&#x27;s Witness would have a purple bar.
* A homosexual or sex offender would have a pink bar.
* An asocial would have a black bar.
* Roma and Sinti would usually be incarcerated in special sub-camps until they died and so would not normally receive a repeat stripe.

Later in the war (late 1944), to save cloth Jewish prisoners wore a yellow bar over a regular point-down triangle to indicate their status. For instance, regular Jews would wear a yellow bar over a red triangle while Jewish criminals would wear a yellow bar over a green triangle.

==== Special marks ====

Many various markings and combinations existed. A prisoner would usually have at least two and possibly more than six.

Limited preventative custody detainee (, or BV) was the term for general criminals (who wore green triangles with no special marks). They originally were only supposed to be incarcerated at the camp until their term expired and then they would be released. However, when the war began they were confined indefinitely for its duration.

 (reformatory inmates) wore E or EH in large black letters on a white square. They were made up of intellectuals and respected community members who could organize and lead a resistance movement, suspicious persons picked up in sweeps or stopped at checkpoints, people caught performing conspiratorial activities or acts and inmates who broke work discipline. They were assigned to hard labor for six to eight weeks and were then released. It was hoped that the threat of permanent incarceration at hard labor would deter them from further action.

 (police inmates), short for (police secure custody inmates), wore either PH in large black letters on a white square or the letter S (for – secure custody) on a green triangle. To save expense, some camps had them just wear their civilian clothes without markings. Records used the letter PSV () to designate them. They were people awaiting trial by a police court-martial or who were already convicted. They were detained in a special jail barracks until they were executed.

Some camps assigned (night and fog) prisoners had them wear two large letters NN in yellow.

Soviet prisoners of war () assigned to work camps () wore two large letters SU (for , meaning Soviet sub-human) in yellow and had vertical stripes painted on their uniforms. They were the few who had not been shot out of hand or died of neglect from untreated wounds, exposure to the elements, or starvation before they could reach a camp. They performed hard labor. Some joined Andrey Vlasov&#x27;s Liberation Army to fight for the Germans.

Labor education detainees () wore a white letter A on their black triangle. This stood for (&quot;work-shy person&quot;), designating stereotypically &quot;lazy&quot; social undesirables like Gypsies, petty criminals (e.g. prostitutes and pickpockets), alcoholics/drug addicts and vagrants. They were usually assigned to work at labor camps.

 (anti-socials) inmates wore a plain black triangle. They were considered either too &quot;selfish&quot; or &quot;deviant&quot; to contribute to society or were considered too impaired to support themselves. They were therefore considered a burden. This category included pacifists and conscription resisters, petty or habitual criminals, the mentally ill and the mentally and/or physically disabled. They were usually executed.

The (punishment battalion) and SS (probation company) were military punishment units. They consisted of and SS military criminals, SS personnel convicted by an Honor Court of bad conduct and civilian criminals for which military service was either the assigned punishment or a voluntary replacement of imprisonment. They wore regular uniforms, but were forbidden rank or unit insignia until they had proven themselves in combat. They wore an uninverted (point-upwards) red triangle on their upper sleeves to indicate their status. Most were used for hard labor, &quot;special tasks&quot; (unwanted dangerous jobs like defusing landmines or running phone cables) or were used as forlorn hopes or cannon fodder. The infamous Dirlewanger Brigade was an example of a regular unit created from such personnel.

A (punishment company) was a hard labor unit in the camps. Inmates assigned to it wore a black roundel bordered white under their triangle patch.

Prisoners &quot;suspected of [attempting to] escape&quot; () wore a red roundel bordered white under their triangle patch. If also assigned to hard labor, they wore the red roundel under their black roundel.

A prisoner-functionary (), or &quot;kapo&quot; (boss), wore a cloth brassard (their , or identifying mark) to indicate their status. They served as camp guards (), barracks clerks () and the senior prisoners (, meaning elders) at the camp (), barracks () and room () levels of camp organization. They received privileges like bigger and sometimes better food rations, better quarters (or even a private room), luxuries (like tobacco or alcohol) and access to the camp&#x27;s facilities (like the showers or the pool). Failure to please their captors meant demotion and loss of privileges and an almost certain death at the hands of their fellow inmates.

Detainees wearing civilian clothing (more common later in the war) instead of the striped uniforms were often marked with a prominent X on the back. This made for an &quot;ersatz&quot; prisoner uniform. For permanence, such Xs were made with white oil paint, with sewn-on cloth strips, or were cut (with underlying jacket-liner fabric providing the contrasting color). Detainees would be compelled to sew their number and (if applicable) a triangle emblem onto the fronts of such X-ed clothing.


== Table of camp inmate markings ==
== Postwar use ==
Triangle-motifs appear on many postwar memorials to the victims of the Nazis. Most triangles are plain while some others bear nationality-letters. The otherwise potentially puzzling designs are a direct reference to the identification patches used in the camps. On such monuments, typically an inverted (point down, base up) triangle (especially if red) evokes all victims, including also the non-Jewish victims like Poles and other Slavs, communists, homosexuals, Roma and Sinti (see Porajmos), people with disability (see Action T4), Soviet POWs and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. An inverted triangle colored pink would symbolize gay male victims. A non-inverted (base down, point up) triangle and/or a yellow triangle is generally more evocative of the Jewish victims.

=== 2020 Trump campaign ===

In June 2020, the re-election campaign of Donald Trump posted an advertisement on Facebook stating that &quot;Dangerous MOBS of far-left groups are running through our streets and causing absolute mayhem&quot; and identifying them as &quot;ANTIFA&quot;, accompanied by a graphic of a downward-pointing red triangle. The ads appeared on the Facebook pages of Donald Trump, the Trump campaign, and Vice President Mike Pence. Many observers compared the graphic to the symbol used by the Nazis for identifying political prisoners such as communists, social democrats and socialists. Many noted the number of ads – 88 – which is associated with neo-Nazis and white supremacists.

As an example of the public outcry against the use of the downward-pointing red triangle, as reported by MotherJones, the Twitter account (@jewishaction), the account of Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, a Progressive Jewish site stated:&quot;The President of the United States is campaigning for reelection using a Nazi concentration camp symbol.
Nazis used the red triangle to mark political prisoners and people who rescued Jews.
Trump &amp; the RNC are using it to smear millions of protestors.

Their masks are off. pic.twitter.com/UzmzDaRBup&quot;Facebook removed the campaign ads with the graphic, saying that its use in this context violated their policy against &quot;organized hate&quot;. The Trump campaign&#x27;s communications director wrote, &quot;The red triangle is a common Antifa symbol used in an ad about Antifa.&quot; Historian Mark Bray, author of &quot;&quot;, disputed this, saying that the symbol is not associated with Antifa in the United States.

=== Israel–Hamas war ===
Some sources have suggested that the inverted red triangle symbol used by Hamas in its propaganda videos is reminiscent of the same red triangle used by the Nazis, with regards to antisemitism during the Gaza war. However, the Nazis used the inverted red triangle to identify prisoners with political views opposed to Nazism, not necessarily Jewish prisoners.

<doc id="447381" wikidata="Q1322130" url="?curid=447381" title="Beatmania IIDX">
<text>(IIDX) is a series of rhythm video games, that was first released by Konami in Japan on 26 February 1999. &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; has since spawned 32 arcade releases and 14 console releases on the Sony PlayStation 2. It is the sequel to the &quot;beatmania&quot; game series, and is part of the Bemani line of music games.

Initially conceived and developed as a sequel to &quot;Beatmania&quot;, Konami released &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; in Japan in 1999. The development team designed the game to simulate the experience of a DJ performing at a real venue, and gave the cabinet a &quot;club Visual Jockey style.&quot; While its predecessor used five keys, &quot;IIDX&quot; had seven of them, increasing the games complexity and skill ceiling. The larger controller was integrated into the cabinet alongside a larger 40-inch widescreen monitor, dual speakers, and spotlights to replicate the feeling of performing at a live venue.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; tasks the player with performing songs through a controller consisting of seven buttons and a turntable. Hitting the notes at the correct time increases the score and groove gauge bar, which if equal to or above 80% on Normal difficulty will allow the player to clear the stage. Failing to hit the notes at the correct time depletes the players groove gauge until it is empty.

Starting from &quot;beatmania IIDX 17 SIRIUS&quot;, two new note types are added: Charge Notes, which require the user to hold and release buttons in time with the music, and Backspin Scratches, which involve spinning the turntable in one direction and then turning it in the opposite direction at the end of the note. &quot;beatmania IIDX 23 copula&quot; introduced a variation called Hell Charge Notes, which refill the gauge when held down but rapidly deplete it when not. Unlike regular Charge Notes, they can be pressed at any time, though missing the start or end will still break the player&#x27;s combo.

Aside from standard single play with seven buttons and a turntable, &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; offers doubles play-style, where users can play with fourteen buttons and two turntables. Certain versions of &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; have modes that are available in both single and double play-styles such as Course mode, Step-up and Arena. In Course mode players are challenged to complete four songs in a row of similar difficulty with a shared health bar, if the health bar reaches zero during any song, the game ends. Step-up mode allows players to play up to four songs without fear of a game-over. However, only a small selections of songs will be available. Arena mode matches up to 4 players in a competitive lobby where each player can pick one song, whichever player performed the best across all 4 songs wins.

===Difficulty levels===
Originally, &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; difficulties ranged from &quot;Level 1&quot; to &quot;Level 7&quot;. However, &quot;beatmania IIDX 5th Style&quot;, &quot;beatmania IIDX 10th Style&quot; and &quot;beatmania IIDX 11 IIDXRED&quot; added &quot;Flashing 7s&quot;, &quot;Level 8&quot; and &quot;Level 8+&quot; respectively.

With the release of &quot;beatmania IIDX 12 HAPPY SKY&quot;, songs were re-rated on a new difficulty scale ranging from &quot;Level 1&quot; to &quot;Level 12&quot;. This has remained the standard in all subsequent releases.

===Groove gauge===
When playing a song in &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; players can set how their groove gauge functions. Easy &amp; Assist Gauge will drain slower on misses, with Assist lowering the bar to clear to 50% instead of the usual 80%. Hard &amp; EX Hard Gauges drain at higher rates when a player misses, and do not regrow as quickly as other gauges. When a Hard or EX Hard gauge hits zero, the song immediately ends.

When a song is cleared, a player will be rewarded with a lamp relative to the gauge used to clear. Available lamps are: Fail, Assist Clear, Easy Clear, Normal Clear, Hard Clear, EX Hard Clear &amp; Full Combo. The lamps appear next to songs during song select.

==History==
In 1997, Konami distributed its Games &amp; Music Division&#x27;s (G.M.D.) &quot;Beatmania&quot; in Japan as a DJ-themed arcade title, significantly influencing rhythm games. Its surprise success influenced the developer to rename itself Bemani, a portmanteau of &quot;Beatmania&quot;, and the studio made several spinoffs following its release, including &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot; and &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;. Due to the success of &quot;Beatmania&quot;, Konami developed and released its sequel 2 years later in 1999.

Bemani developed several updates to the game after its release, Including a crossover in &quot;Beatmania IIDX Club Version&quot; (later &quot;Substream&quot;) cabinets with &quot;Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix&quot; machines for simultaneous play, leading to increased success &amp; popularity. In late 1999, the publisher hired artist Goli to design graphics and characters for &quot;Beatmania IIDX 2nd Style&quot;. The next game in the &quot;IIDX&quot; series, &quot;3rd Style&quot;, featured a new aesthetic and was ported to the PlayStation 2. In 2002, &quot;8th Style&quot; was released after the discontinuation of the original five-key &quot;Beatmania&quot;. Foster said the updates popularized the game to the point that it overshadowed &quot;Beatmania&quot;, and &quot;IIDX&quot; earned more new songs and became known for being very difficult. A sequel with a five-key controller, &quot;Beatmania III&quot;, was released in 2000 but did not see similar success. &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; still receives yearly arcade updates which feature new songs, new theming and new events.

=== Home releases ===
A video game named &quot;Beatmania&quot; was released in North America in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, This was one of the only official ways to play &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; in the west. In 2015, a PC release titled &quot;beatmania IIDX INFINITAS&quot; was announced, and began alpha testing in September. On January 29, 2020, &quot;Heroic Verse&quot;″s LIGHTNING MODEL cabinets received a North American release. On August 5, 2020, a new version of &quot;Infinitas&quot; was released. This new version is similar to the Lightning upgrade for arcade releases, having support for 120 Hz displays and an improved engine.

In 2019, three mobile games were announced by Konami during the Japan Amusement Expo, representing three Bemani series: &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot;, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, and &quot;Sound Voltex&quot;. Only &quot;Beatmania IIDX Ultimate Mobile&quot; was released to the public, with Sound Voltex and Dance Dance Revolution Ultimate Mobile being cancelled shortly after location tests.

==Hardware==
The &quot;beatmania IIDX&quot; cabinet has many standard features that are found in traditional arcade cabinets such as a widescreen display, powerful speakers, and start buttons. Also, unique to &quot;IIDX&quot; cabinets are the effector buttons and sliders, a bass platform transducer, marquee, and DJ simulating controller. The effector buttons and sliders allow the player to control the volume levels within the game and manipulate the music by adding additional sound effects. The bass platform vibrates beneath the player&#x27;s feet to the beat of the music being played. The marquee is a series of sixteen-segment display LEDs, used to display game information and scores during gameplay.

===Controller information===
&quot;beatmania IIDX&quot; controls consist two sets of seven keys on each player&#x27;s side, along with a turntable on each side. The turntable for the left player&#x27;s side is to the left of the keys, while the one on the right player&#x27;s side is to the right.

Each set of keys is arranged in a pattern of four white keys beneath three black keys. The black keys are offset from the white keys so that each pair of adjacent white keys has a black key above and in between them. This arrangement mimics the F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B keys on a musical keyboard, though beatmania keys, being about twice as long as they are wide, do not resemble piano keys. The keys are commonly numbered 1 through 7, from left to right. The four white keys are numbered 1, 3, 5, and 7; the three black keys are numbered 2, 4, 6.

Along the release of &quot;Beatmania IIDX 25&quot; &quot;Cannon Ballers&quot;, two cameras are installed, one on the metal cage pointing to the controls, and another at left pointing to the players. Initially, the game would not boot up if the cameras weren&#x27;t attached; this was fixed after initial release. After the release of &quot;Beatmania IIDX 26&quot; &quot;Rootage&quot;, QR code reading functionality was added to the left camera.

With the release of &quot;beatmania IIDX 27&quot; &quot;Heroic Verse&quot;, a new cabinet called LIGHTNING MODEL was introduced. The effect sliders, LCD marquee and keypads have been replaced with a touchscreen called the Premium Area, located under the screen where the sliders used to be. Due to the removal of the slider panel, the start buttons have been relocated to the upper-left and upper-right of the 1P and 2P keys respectively, and the VEFX and EFFECT buttons are located above the coin slot, as with 5-key beatmania machines. The front of the cabinet also features 3.5mm headphone jacks on each side, although this does not mute the speakers.

===e-amusement===
Since &quot;9th Style&quot;, the game has featured integration with Konami&#x27;s &quot;e-amusement&quot; platform, which uses a card inserted at the beginning of the game to save stats, scores, allow customization, and track scores in comparison to previous plays and against others over the internet. A magnetic card reader was used from 9th Style to Happy Sky (12th). From &quot;Distorted&quot; onwards the newer type Contactless smartcard Konami &quot;e-amusement&quot; Pass system has been used. &quot;9th Style&quot; did not require an internet connection to use a subset of the &quot;e-amusement&quot; functionality, but 10th and on required an internet connection to function, which must be provided by a subscription from Konami. Some versions can customize frames, BGM in SELECT MUSIC screen, notes, etc.. &quot;e-amusement&quot; is not available outside of the primary markets for &quot;IIDX&quot; (Japan, Asia, and the United States), which has left imported machines outside of Asia without full access to hidden songs and extra stages due to the increasing functionality and integration of &quot;e-amusement&quot; in more recent styles. However, new songs from &quot;e-amusement&quot; enabled styles can still be accessed on console versions (which can be imported from Japan) or in INFINITAS. As of &quot;Tricoro&quot;, required an internet connection to startup instead. As of &quot;Rootage&quot;, offline kits are returned.

=== Internal hardware ===
Each game since 9th style runs on a &quot;Bemani PC&quot;, a custom PC based system designed specifically for Bemani&#x27;s games. Games prior to 9th style use Bemani Twinkle, which in turn is a PlayStation with a superimposer and an advanced sound board combined with a DVD player. As of the newest cabinet model for the &quot;Lightning&quot; cabinet introduced with &quot;Beatmania IIDX 27: Heroic Verse&quot;, there is an Nvidia GTX 1660, an Intel Core i5 9400F, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 256GB SATA SSD. The cabinets also use a custom amplifier in addition to an Asus Xonar XE sound card, and run a limited version of Windows 10. There is also a 120 Hz main display and a touchscreen second display. Older versions of the cabinets running PC based hardware generally were significantly weaker as they did not have to power 2 displays. The final revision prior to the Lightning Model use &quot;Bemani PC&quot; ADE-6291, that is powered by an AMD RX-421BD, an R7 Radeon GPU and has 4GB of RAM.

==Music==
Music is an integral part of the &quot;beatmania IIDX&quot; series. Featuring a wide selection of genres and artists, both licensed and in-house, the &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; series is well known for its original music. Konami produces an original soundtrack of each game, usually a few months after release, due to the appeal of the music. Konami also releases original albums by &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; artists through its online store, Konamistyle. It&#x27;s also a tradition that Konami crossovers some songs from and into other Bemani games such as &quot;Pop&#x27;n Music&quot;, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot;, and &quot;Sound Voltex&quot;.

Each new AC release typically features around 60-100 new songs (+100 since &quot;Rootage&quot;), with a selection of songs returning from previous versions and some songs having LEGGENDARIA charts. The current release, &quot;beatmania IIDX 29 CastHour&quot;, features a library of over 1500 songs. Some songs are split across difficulties or styles. CS releases feature all of the new songs of their corresponding AC versions (with limited exceptions), 5-10 CS exclusive songs, around 25 &quot;revival&quot; (returning) songs, and 1-3 preview songs, for a total of around 60-100 songs (&quot;Empress&quot; uses 2 discs, each with 99 songs per disc). Arcade versions since &quot;9th Style&quot; run on Bemani PC, rather than the PlayStation-based Bemani Twinkle, allowing them to have more songs with higher quality sound due to larger hard drives and higher end hardware.

Songs often include music videos when played, although only some songs contain dedicated videos. Some songs contain generic videos shared by multiple songs, and some of these have additional animated graphics overlaid atop them. Beginning with &quot;beatmania IIDX 19 Lincle&quot;, players can select &quot;Qpro&quot; characters or customize them, and some songs show Qpros as part of overlays (exc. in &quot;beatmania IIDX Infinitas&quot;, due to Qpros being unsupported). Beginning with &quot;beatmania IIDX 20 tricoro&quot;, overlays of some songs were removed, and in &quot;beatmania IIDX 9th Style&quot;, the effector system is not available, both due to hardware limitations. Beginning with &quot;beatmania IIDX 25 CANNON BALLERS&quot;, the effector system is expanded to 8 effect options, adjunt with EQ ONLY. In mobile games and in &quot;beatmania IIDX Infinitas&quot; (2015), the effector system is disabled.

==Releases==
&quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; is an arcade sequel to Konami&#x27;s Beatmania Series, starting with bi-annual &quot;Style&quot; releases in 1999 followed by themed annual releases from 2004 onwards. Starting with 3rd style, &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; saw releases on the PlayStation 2 home consoles which continued up until Empress.

Beginning with &quot;Beatmania IIDX 27 HEROIC VERSE&quot;, LIGHTNING MODEL cabinets were officially sold for use in the United States due to the increase presence of Round One arcades.

=== Home releases ===

Starting with 3rd style, &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; was released in Japan on PlayStation 2 home consoles. These releases generally followed their corresponding arcade versions up until Beatmania IIDX 16 EMPRESS, which was the final style to have a corresponding console version. PlayStation 2 versions of &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; never saw sale overseas however the US received Beatmania in 2006 which contained songs from both the beatmania and &quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; series, as well as eight new licensed songs. This was the only beatmania game officially released in the region until &quot;Beatmania IIDX 27 HEROIC VERSE&quot; in 2020.

&quot;Beatmania IIDX&quot; home releases are known as CS (Consumer Software or Console) versions, while the arcade versions are known as AC (Arcade Cabinet) versions. The CS games can be played with a DualShock controller or with a special controller sold by konami that recereates the arcade experience.

In 2015 Konami released &quot;Beatmania IIDX INFINITAS&quot; for Home PCs. The game required a monthly subscription to play. Infinitas was given a major overhaul in 2020 allowing for 120 Hz gameplay to be inline with the LIGHTNING MODEL. Unlike other home releases, this version does not tie in with an arcade version.

<doc id="447382" wikidata="Q709136" url="?curid=447382" title="Bates method">
<text>The Bates method is an ineffective and potentially dangerous alternative therapy aimed at improving eyesight. Eye-care physician William Horatio Bates (1860–1931) held the erroneous belief that the extraocular muscles caused changes in focus and that &quot;mental strain&quot; caused abnormal action of these muscles; hence he believed that relieving such &quot;strain&quot; would cure defective vision. In 1952, optometry professor Elwin Marg wrote of Bates, &quot;Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists.&quot;

No type of training has been shown to change the refractive power of the eye. Moreover, certain aspects of the Bates method can put its followers at risk: They may damage their eyes through overexposure to sunlight, not wear their corrective lenses when they need them (e.g., while driving), or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.

== Early history ==

In 1891, Bates published an article in the &quot;New York Medical Journal&quot; claiming to have successfully reversed seven cases of nearsightedness, or myopia. In 1911, Bates published an article claiming to have taught myopic schoolchildren how to correctly focus in the distance. He recommended that schools post a Snellen chart in each classroom and encourage students to read it daily.

In 1917, Bates teamed up with &quot;&#x27;physical culture&#x27; faddist&quot; Bernarr Macfadden on a &quot;New Course of Eye Training&quot; which was heavily advertised in the &quot;Physical Culture&quot; magazine. Bates&#x27; name was later dropped from the advertising, but Macfadden continued to market this correspondence course, which was renamed &quot;Strengthening the Eyes&quot;. This course was criticized by the American Medical Association&#x27;s Bureau of Investigation as dangerous quackery. In July 1919, Bates began publishing &quot;&quot;, &quot;A Monthly Magazine Devoted to the Prevention and Cure of Imperfect Sight Without Glasses&quot;. This was also criticized &quot;as it were the product of a psychopathic ward&quot;.

In 1920, Bates self-published a book, &quot;&quot; (or &quot;Perfect Sight Without Glasses&quot;). In 1926, articles by his assistant Emily Lierman were re-printed in a book titled &quot;Stories From the Clinic&quot;; some of these stories claimed that such methods had cured glaucoma and cataracts as well as refractive errors. In 1929, the Federal Trade Commission lodged a complaint against Bates for advertising &quot;falsely or misleadingly&quot;.

== Underlying concepts ==

=== Accommodation ===

Accommodation is the process by which the vertebrate eye adjusts optical power to maintain focus on the retina while the eye&#x27;s gaze shifts to a point either closer or farther away. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the ciliary muscle, a muscle &quot;within&quot; the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye&#x27;s crystalline lens. This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens&#x27; shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as &quot;so blurred that it is impossible to tell whether one image is larger than the other&quot;, in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late 19th century.

Bates adhered to a different explanation of accommodation that had already been generally disregarded by the medical community of his time. Bates&#x27; model had the muscles &quot;surrounding&quot; the eyeball controlling its focus. In addition to their known function of turning the eye, Bates maintained, they also affect its shape, elongating the eyeball to focus at the near-point or shortening it to focus at a distance. Science author John Grant writes that many animals, such as fishes, accommodate by elongation of the eyeball, &quot;it&#x27;s just that humans aren&#x27;t one of those animals.&quot;

Laboratory tests have shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be necessary to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 μm) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.

=== Causes of sight problems ===

Medical professionals characterize refractive errors as consequences of the eye&#x27;s shape and other basic anatomy, which no evidence shows any exercise can alter. Bates, however, believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball, which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape (per his explanation of accommodation) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther. Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a &quot;mental strain&quot; to see, the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight. He also linked disturbances in the circulation of blood, which he said is &quot;very largely influenced by thought&quot;, not only to refractive errors, but also to double vision, crossed-eye, lazy eye, and to more serious eye conditions such as cataracts and glaucoma. His therapies were based on these assumptions.

Bates felt that corrective lenses, which he characterized as &quot;eye crutches&quot;, are an impediment to curing poor vision. In his view, &quot;strain&quot; would increase as the eyes adjust to the correction in front of them. He thus recommended that glasses be discarded by anyone applying his method.

== Treatments ==

In his writings, Bates discussed several techniques that he claimed helped patients to improve their sight. These techniques were all supposed to relieve &quot;strain&quot; to which Bates attributed sight problems.

=== Palming ===
Bates suggested closing the eyes for minutes at a time to help bring about relaxation. He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by &quot;palming&quot;, or covering the closed eyes with the palms of the hands, without putting pressure on the eyeballs. If the covered eyes did not strain, he said, they would see &quot;a field so black that it is impossible to remember, imagine, or see anything blacker&quot;, since light was excluded by the palms. However, he reported that some of his patients experienced &quot;illusions of lights and colors&quot; sometimes amounting to &quot;kaleidoscopic appearances&quot; as they &quot;palmed&quot;, occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous &quot;strain&quot; and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed. This phenomenon, however, was almost certainly caused by Eigengrau or &quot;dark light&quot;. In fact, even in conditions of perfect darkness, as inside a cave, neurons at every level of the visual system produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color.

If while palming one ends up applying pressure to the eyes, this may increase the risk of glaucoma.

=== Visualization ===

Bates placed importance on mental images, as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight. He claimed that one&#x27;s poise could be gauged by the visual memory of black; that the darker it appeared in the mind, and the smaller the area of black that could be imagined, the more relaxed one was at the moment. He recommended that patients think of the top letter from an eye chart and then visualize progressively smaller black letters, and eventually a period or comma. He cautioned against &quot;concentrating&quot; on such images, as he regarded an attempt to &quot;think of one thing only&quot; as a strain.

While Bates preferred to have patients imagine something black, he also reported that some found objects of other colors easiest to visualize, thus were benefited most by remembering those, because, he asserted, &quot;the memory can never be perfect unless it is easy.&quot; Skeptics reason that the only benefit to eyesight gained from such techniques is &quot;itself&quot; imagined, and point out that familiar objects, including letters on an eye chart, can be recognized even when they appear less than clear.

=== Movement ===

Bates thought that the manner of eye movement affected the sight. He suggested &quot;shifting&quot;, or moving the eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects &quot;swinging&quot; in the opposite direction. He believed that the smaller the area over which the &quot;swing&quot; was experienced, the greater was the benefit to sight. He combined this with visualization, advocating that patients close their eyes and imagine movement of objects. By alternating actual and mental shifting over an image, Bates wrote, many patients were quickly able to shorten the &quot;shift&quot; to a point where they could &quot;conceive and swing a letter the size of a period in a newspaper&quot;.

Perhaps finding Bates&#x27; concepts of &quot;shifting&quot; and &quot;swinging&quot; too complicated, Bernarr Macfadden suggested simply moving the eyes up and down, from side to side, and shifting one&#x27;s gaze between a near-point and a far-point.
=== Sunning ===

Bates advocated sungazing, characterizing ill effects as &quot;always temporary&quot;. This is at odds with the well-known risk of eye damage that can result from direct sunlight observation.

In his magazine, Bates later suggested exposing only the white part of the eyeball to direct sunlight, and only for seconds at a time, after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period. Posthumous publications of Bates&#x27; book omitted mention of the supposed benefits from direct sunlight shining on open eyes. Even on closed eyes, direct sunlight exposure poses a risk of damage to the eyelids, including skin cancer.
== After Bates ==

After Bates died in 1931, his methods of treatment were continued by his widow Emily and other associates. In 1932, Gayelord Hauser published a book endorsing the Bates method but also adding new exercises and recommendations for his own dietary products. Most subsequent proponents did not stand by Bates&#x27; explanation of how the eye focused mechanically, but nonetheless maintained that relieving habitual &quot;strain&quot; was the key to improving sight.

=== Margaret Darst Corbett ===

Margaret Darst Corbett first met Bates when she consulted him about her husband&#x27;s eyesight. She became his pupil, and eventually taught his method at her School of Eye Education in Los Angeles. She was of the stated belief that &quot;the optic nerve is really part of the brain, and vision is nine-tenths mental and one-tenth only physical.&quot;

In late 1940, Corbett and her assistant were charged with violations of the Medical Practice Act of California for treating eyes without a license. At the trial, many of her students testified on her behalf, describing in detail how she had enabled them to discard their glasses. One witness testified that he had been almost blind from cataracts, but that after working with Corbett, his vision had improved to such an extent that for the first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses. Corbett explained in court that she was practicing neither optometry nor ophthalmology and represented herself not as a doctor, but only as an &quot;instructor of eye training&quot;. Describing her method, she said, &quot;We turn vision on by teaching the eyes to shift. We want the sense of motion to relieve staring, to end the fixed look. We use light to relax the eyes and to accustom them to the sun.&quot;

The trial attracted widespread interest, as did the &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. The case spurred a bill in the Californian State Legislature that would have then made such vision &quot;education&quot; illegal without an optometric or medical license. After a lively campaign in the media, the bill was rejected.

=== Aldous Huxley ===

Perhaps the most famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of 16, Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light perception and the other with an unaided Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity in the center of the cornea.

In 1939, at the age of 45 and with eyesight that continued to deteriorate, he happened to hear of the Bates method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett, who gave him regular lessons. Three years later, he wrote &quot;The Art of Seeing&quot;, in which he related: &quot;Within a couple of months, I was reading without spectacles, and what was better still, without strain and fatigue... At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is about twice as good as it used to be when I wore spectacles.&quot; Describing the process, Huxley wrote, &quot;Vision is not won by making an effort to get it: it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity, of dynamic relaxation.&quot; He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates&#x27; explanation of how the eye focuses, stating, &quot;my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation, but with the art of seeing.&quot;

His case generated wide publicity, as well as scrutiny. Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster, for example, suggested in 1944 that Huxley had &quot;learned how to use what he has to better advantage&quot; by training the &quot;cerebral part of seeing&quot;, rather than actually improving the quality of the image on the retina.

In 1952, 10 years after writing &quot;The Art of Seeing&quot;, Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses, and according to Bennett Cerf, apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty. In Cerf&#x27;s words:
Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn&#x27;t reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory, he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away, he still couldn&#x27;t read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.

In response to this, Huxley wrote, &quot;I often do use magnifying glasses where conditions of light are bad, and have never claimed to be able to read except under very good conditions.&quot; This underscored that he had not regained anything close to normal vision, and in fact never claimed that he had.

=== Modern variants ===

&quot;Natural vision correction&quot; or &quot;natural vision improvement&quot; continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction, many of whom have no medical or optometric credentials. Most base their approach in the Bates method, though some also integrate vision therapy techniques. Also, many self-help books and programs, which have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials, are aimed at improving eyesight naturally. Purveyors of such approaches argue that they lack the funds to formally test them.

The heavily advertised &quot;See Clearly Method&quot; (of which sales were halted by a court order in November 2006, in response to what were found to be dishonest marketing practices) included &quot;palming&quot; and &quot;light therapy&quot;, both adapted from Bates. The creators of the program, however, emphasized that they did not endorse Bates&#x27; approach overall.

In his 1992 book &quot;The Bates Method, A Complete Guide to Improving Eyesight—Naturally&quot;, &quot;Bates method teacher&quot; Peter Mansfield was very critical of eye care professionals for prescribing corrective lenses. The book included accounts of 12 &quot;real cases&quot;, but did not report any information about refractive error.

Czech native John Slavicek claims to have created an &quot;eye cure&quot; that improves eyesight in three days, borrowing from ancient yogic eye exercises, visualizations from the Seth Material, and the Bates method. Although he has testimonials from his neighbor and others, several of his students indicate that he has greatly exaggerated their cases. Slavicek&#x27;s self-published manual, &quot;Yoga for the Eyes&quot;, was rejected by an ophthalmologist who evaluated it, and evinced no interest from the World Health Organization and St. Erik&#x27;s Eye Foundation in Sweden, as he had not conducted double-blind tests.

== Possible reasons for claimed improvements ==

Some eye conditions may naturally change for the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder suggested that this happened with Aldous Huxley&#x27;s keratitis). A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time. One who has been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.

When corrective lenses are removed, vision can adapt to lessen the initial perceived blur, sometimes by more than two lines on an eye chart. This phenomenon is known as blur adaptation. Some studies have suggested that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may also account for perceived improvements in eyesight.

== General research ==
In 2004 the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) published a review of various research regarding &quot;visual training&quot;, which consisted of &quot;eye exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback, eye patches, or eye massages&quot;, &quot;alone or in combinations&quot;. No evidence was found that such techniques could objectively benefit eyesight, though some studies noted changes, both positive and negative, in the visual acuity of nearsighted subjects as measured by a Snellen chart. In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow-ups. However, these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness, and were attributed instead to factors such as &quot;improvements in interpreting blurred images, changes in mood or motivation, creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes, or a pinhole effect from miosis of the pupil.&quot;

In 2005 the Ophthalmology Department of New Zealand&#x27;s Christchurch Hospital published a review of forty-three studies regarding the use of eye exercises. They found that &quot;As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises&quot; to improve visual acuity, and concluded that &quot;their use therefore remains controversial.&quot;

== General criticisms ==

=== Dead-end ===

A frequent criticism of the Bates method is that it has remained relatively obscure, which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective. Writer Alan M. MacRobert concluded in a 1979 article that the &quot;most telling argument against the Bates system&quot; and other alternative therapies was that they &quot;bore no fruit&quot;. In regards to the Bates method, he reasoned that &quot;If palming, shifting, and swinging could really cure poor eyesight, glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse-drawn carriages.&quot;

Philosopher Frank J. Leavitt has argued that the method Bates described would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked, &quot;How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?&quot; Regarding the possibility of a placebo trial, Leavitt commented, &quot;I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not.&quot;

=== Corrective lenses and safety ===
Discarding one&#x27;s corrective lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses weaker than one&#x27;s prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially when one is operating a motor vehicle. James Randi related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses for this reason, wrecked his car. Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.

=== Avoidance of conventional treatment ===

A follower of the Bates method may neglect urgently needed medical treatment for a condition such as glaucoma, which can lead to blindness. Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates&#x27; ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.

<text>Alexander Schleicher (May 22, 1901 – April 26, 1968) was a German pioneer of sailplane design. The company that he founded and which bears his name - [[Alexander Schleicher GmbH &amp; Co]] - is today one of the world&#x27;s leading sailplane manufacturers.

Schleicher was born in Huhnrain, the son of a joiner. From the time he was fourteen years old, he worked with his father and learned his trade. As an apprentice, he worked at a furniture factory before commencing work at the Weltensegler aircraft factory in Baden-Baden in 1923. Two years later, he arrived at the Wasserkuppe and worked in the workshop of the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft building sailplanes. He also learned to fly, and in 1926 won a major prize in the annual gliding championships held on the Wasserkuppe. He used this money to found his own company, beginning in the Huhnrain dance hall, and later at a rented workshop in Remmerz.

Schleicher continued to design aircraft for the firm until the outbreak of World War II, and again when German civil aviation resumed in 1951. During the years of the Allied occupation, he returned to his roots and designed furniture for the company to manufacture.

He personally managed the firm until his death in Fulda in 1968.

<doc id="447385" wikidata="Q1288049" url="?curid=447385" title="Signing Off">
<text>Signing Off is the debut album by British reggae band UB40, released in the UK on 29 August 1980 by Dudley-based independent label Graduate Records. It was an immediate success in their home country, reaching number 2 on the UK albums chart, and made UB40 one of the many popular reggae bands in Britain, several years before the band found international fame. The politically-concerned lyrics struck a chord in a country with widespread public divisions over high unemployment, the policies of the recently elected Conservative party under Margaret Thatcher, and the rise of the National Front party, while the record&#x27;s dub-influenced rhythms reflected the late 1970s influence in British pop music of West Indian music introduced by immigrants from the Caribbean after the Second World War, particularly reggae and ska – this was typified by the 2 Tone movement, at that point at the height of its success and led by fellow West Midlands act The Specials, with whom UB40 drew comparisons due to their multiracial band line-up and socialist views.

Still considered by many fans and music critics to be UB40&#x27;s best album, &quot;Signing Off&quot; was reissued for its 30th anniversary in 2010 as a &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; containing bonus tracks and a DVD of the videos for the singles plus television footage of the band from the time of the album&#x27;s release.

==Recording==
After forming in 1978, the members of UB40 made an agreement to spend the next year doing nothing more than learning their instruments and practising their songs until they felt they were good enough. Saxophonist Brian Travers said, &quot;We commandeered a cellar and started rehearsing every day, nine till five. Our first experiences of playing an instrument started together, and we&#x27;d humiliate each other over mistakes. But we were very serious about our music. It was a year before we played our first gig. It was in an upper room at the &#x27;Hare and Hounds&#x27; [a pub] in Kings Heath, Birmingham. We played the whole of &quot;Signing Off&quot; because they were the only songs we knew.&quot;

Towards the end of 1979 the band felt confident enough to start recording their songs, and approached local musician Bob Lamb as he was the only person they knew with any recording experience. Lamb had been the drummer with the Steve Gibbons Band for much of the 1970s and was a well-known figure within the Birmingham music scene. He remembered that &quot;&#x27;King&#x27; was the very first song they ever played to me, and it just blew my mind basically, to realise a bunch of kids could make a sound like that... it blew me away. And that was it for me, I was hooked, it was a bit like Elvis walks in or something, you know, it was one of those moments.&quot; However, as the band were unable to afford a proper recording studio, the album was recorded in Lamb&#x27;s own home at the time, a ground-floor flat in a house on Cambridge Road in Birmingham&#x27;s Moseley district that later became affectionately known as the &quot;Home of the Hits&quot;. Lamb would later use the money he earned from the album&#x27;s success to build a proper recording studio, Highbury Studio, in an old cricket bat factory in nearby Kings Heath, which remained under his ownership until his retirement in 2010 – during the 1980s and 90s he would go on to produce the early demos for Duran Duran and work on the debut albums by fellow Birmingham natives Ruby Turner, The Lilac Time and Ocean Colour Scene. However, in an interview to mark &quot;Signing Off&quot;&#x27;s 30th anniversary, Brian Travers recalled just how basic the recording facilities of the original Cambridge Road &quot;studio&quot; really were:

Producer Lamb described the somewhat relaxed recording process:

and also remembered how easy it was to make the album:

The LP album was recorded in three separate sessions: four days in December 1979 just before Christmas which produced the songs &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Food for Thought&quot; for the debut single, and two longer sessions in March–April 1980 and June–July 1980 when the bulk of the album was recorded. The three tracks for the 12&quot; record that came with the album were recorded during 18–20 July 1980 at The Music Centre with Ray &quot;Pablo&quot; Falconer, bassist Earl Falconer&#x27;s brother, handling production duties. Falconer would go on to produce the majority of UB40&#x27;s subsequent records until his death in a car crash in 1987.

==Musical style and composition==

&quot;Signing Off&quot; featured a mix of reggae and dub material which was lyrically politically charged and socially conscious, while musically it was reverb-heavy, doom-laden yet mellifluous, best exemplified in the hits &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Food For Thought&quot; as well as the searing &quot;Burden of Shame&quot;. Four of the album&#x27;s thirteen tracks were instrumentals—&quot;Adella&quot;, &quot;25%&quot; (allegedly titled after the increase in wages demanded by the unions in the late 1970s to reflect a &quot;living wage&quot;), &quot;Signing Off&quot; and &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;—all heavily influenced by dub reggae rhythms and effects such as reverb and echo, and led by Mickey Virtue&#x27;s keyboard and Travers&#x27; saxophone melodies. Two tracks were cover versions: an early Randy Newman composition &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot; and the blues classic &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; (made famous by Billie Holiday), two songs that dealt with compassion for fellow humans and racism respectively. The main theme in &quot;Burden of Shame&quot; is copied from Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot;. This track and the remaining five self-composed tracks were all concerned with social and political issues:

*&quot;Tyler&quot; was written about the young black American Gary Tyler, who at the age of 17 was convicted by an all-white judge and jury of murdering a 13-year-old white boy, despite serious irregularities in the prosecution case and the lack of a murder weapon ever being found. UB40 intended &quot;Tyler&quot; to be their first single in the United States. The band revisited the subject on the song &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot; on their 2008 album &quot;TwentyFourSeven&quot;.
*&quot;King&quot; was about the late Martin Luther King Jr., questioning the lost direction of the slain leader&#x27;s followers and the state of mourning of a nation after his death.
*&quot;Burden of Shame&quot; recounted the misdeeds performed in the name of British Imperialism.
*&quot;Food for Thought&quot; was an attempt to publicise and condemn the famine in north Africa, comparing it with the Western over-indulgent celebration of Christmas, nearly five years before Band Aid brought the subject to widespread attention. Subsequently, it was also a prominent feature of UB40&#x27;s 2005 Live 8 appearance in Hyde Park, London, 25 years after the song had been first released. Bob Lamb later revealed that the song&#x27;s original working title had been &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; until one of the band&#x27;s roadies suggested &quot;Food for Thought&quot; would be a better title.
*&quot;Little by Little&quot; highlighted the growing inequality between the rich and the poor.
*&quot;Madam Medusa&quot; was a vivid description of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s rise to power depicted in a grotesque style, featuring some of the band&#x27;s most impassioned and bitter lyrics.

==Release and promotion==
The album&#x27;s release was preceded by two double A-sided singles. The first, &quot;King&quot;/&quot;Food For Thought&quot;, was released as UB40&#x27;s debut single in February 1980. It topped the independent music chart for three months, reached number 4 in the main UK singles chart, and went on to sell nearly half a million copies, having been certified silver for sales of 250,000 copies in May 1980. It was the first single on a completely independent label without the backing of a major record company to reach the top 10 of the UK singles chart. Upon the single&#x27;s release &quot;Food for Thought&quot; gained more radio airplay than &quot;King&quot; – speaking about the single in 2010, Bob Lamb said, &quot;&#x27;Food for Thought&#x27; was actually the B-side of &#x27;King&#x27; originally: although it was a double A-side &#x27;King&#x27; was always going to be the main song, but the DJs picked up on &#x27;Food for Thought&#x27; because it was quicker and chirpier, more dancey, more of a radio track. So they played that a lot, and really that became the hit, &#x27;Food for Thought&#x27;, but whenever you bought the record it always said &#x27;King&#x27;/&#x27;Food for Thought&#x27; – &#x27;King&#x27; was always, like, the first name on the record, which I thought was pretty cool.&quot;

The follow-up single &quot;My Way of Thinking&quot;/&quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot; peaked at number 6 on the UK charts in June 1980. Although this was the band&#x27;s second single before the album was released, &quot;My Way of Thinking&quot; was not included on the album, despite gaining far more radio airplay and television exposure than &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot;: however, by the time of the album&#x27;s release the group had come to dislike &quot;My Way of Thinking&quot;, with singer Ali Campbell describing the song as &quot;awful&quot;.

The original 1980 vinyl release of &quot;Signing Off&quot; consisted of a ten-track LP (played at the standard 33 rpm) plus a three-track 12&quot; record (played at 45 rpm) which contained the tracks &quot;Madam Medusa&quot;, &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; and &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;. On the cassette version all thirteen tracks were split over the two sides of the cassette. When the album was issued on CD for the first time in 1984, it contained all thirteen tracks of the LP and cassette versions.

In 1985 the album was repackaged as a double album under the title &quot;The UB40 File&quot;, with the addition of &quot;My Way of Thinking&quot;, &quot;The Earth Dies Screaming&quot; and &quot;Dream a Lie&quot;, thus collecting together on a single album all of UB40&#x27;s output on Graduate Records, before the band&#x27;s subsequent releases on their own DEP International label. The latter two songs were released as UB40&#x27;s third single (another double A-side) two months after the release of &quot;Signing Off&quot;, and were written and recorded at the same time as the album. For a short time in 1981–82 in Australia, the original album was released with a bonus 45 rpm single containing these two tracks, packaged in an identical smaller version of the album cover. &quot;The UB40 File&quot; has subsequently also been released on CD.

In 2010, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release Virgin Records reissued the album as a three-disc (two CDs and a DVD) &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;, with extensive liner notes by Birmingham-born journalist Peter Paphides. The bonus tracks on the second CD included the 12&quot; versions of all four sides of UB40&#x27;s second and third singles, and the two sessions the band recorded at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios for the John Peel and Kid Jensen shows on BBC Radio 1. The DVD contained the videos made for five of the six songs on their first three double A-side singles, the band&#x27;s first ever appearance on the BBC television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; performing &quot;Food for Thought&quot;, and the concert recorded at Keele University for BBC2&#x27;s television series &quot;Rock Goes to College&quot;. To tie in with the 30th anniversary reissue, the band announced a concert tour where they would perform a first set of the album in its entirety, followed by a second set of other hits.

==Artwork==
The front and back covers of the album are a replica of the yellow British UB40 unemployment benefit attendance card from which the band took their name, emphatically stamped with the words SIGNING OFF in capital letters. It was a statement by the band of leaving behind the world of unemployment and of their arrival on the music scene. The artwork was created by brothers Geoffrey and David Tristram: Geoff went on to become an artist and novelist, while David became a comic playwright.

==Critical reception==
The album was extremely well received and lauded by the UK music magazines at the time of its original release. &quot;Sounds&quot; awarded &quot;Signing Off&quot; five stars out of five, claiming that &quot;it is an (almost) perfect album... It&#x27;s rare to find a debut album so detailed, so excellently played and so packed with bite – I sometimes think it hasn&#x27;t really happened since &quot;The Clash&quot;.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; described the album as &quot;a courageous debut... Their radical sentiments and trenchant lyrics are given all the more force by the soft-fist of UB40&#x27;s measured musical delivery... The music might be mellow, but the hard-backed sentiments are hardly those of the nice reggae band you may have pigeonholed the UBs as.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said &quot;The UBs, chirpy and still fully independent, have wrapped up their initial promise and persuasion and delivered a well-girthed winner of a debut album... Certainly the music of UB40 benefits far more in both quality and quantity from the exacting freedom of an LP than any of their close contemporaries... the band have broadened out the unique, shy commerciality of the two singles, &quot;King&quot; and &quot;Food for Thought&quot;... to an approach that sharpens the shape of their music and magnifies the message.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; called the band &quot;important&quot; and observed that &quot;their subtle dance music is opening up a lot of ears to the pleasures of British reggae&quot;.

More recent critical reviews show the album remains highly regarded. AllMusic said &quot;Their rhythms may have been reggae-based, their music Jamaican-inspired, but UB40 had such an original take on the genre that all comparisons were moot... Their music was... revolutionary, their sound unlike anything else on either island [referring to Great Britain and Jamaica]... It&#x27;s hard to believe this is the same UB40 that later topped the U.K. charts with the likes of &#x27;Red Red Wine&#x27; and &#x27;I Got You Babe&#x27;. Their fire was dampened quickly, but on &quot;Signing Off&quot; it blazed high, still accessible to the pop market, but so edgy that even those who are sure there&#x27;s nothing about the group to admire will change their tune instantly.&quot; In 2008 &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine&#x27;s online website revisited the album as part of their &quot;Disc of the Day&quot; series, calling it &quot;the Brum reggae institution&#x27;s original and best&quot; and going on to say that &quot;&quot;Signing Off&quot; was a singular British take on Jamaican music, in some ways truer to the reggae source than 2-Tone but with a punky, multi-cultured sensibility of its own... it&#x27;s a superb balance of lightness and weight, as spry, skanking tunes rub up against militant lyrics made soulful by vocalist Ali Campbell.&quot; The print edition of the magazine also reviewed the 2010 reissue, stating that &quot;&quot;Signing Off&quot;... has retained much of its fire... this is flinty, political and Britain-focused reggae, distinct from the later output of a band that... still acts as the form&#x27;s global ambassadors.&quot; Reviewing the 2010 Collector&#x27;s Edition, BBC Music said &quot;&quot;Signing Off&quot; is still believed by many to be the group&#x27;s greatest album, and it remains the clearest window into what the band were all about... [it] has energy and intelligence that made it stand out from so much post-punk pop. This set sums up a bunch of young Brummies schooled in the West Indian blues dances of Balsall Heath, angry about the world around them and articulate enough to express that without simply ranting.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Signing Off&quot; was placed at number 13 in the &quot;NME&quot; critics&#x27; list of the albums of the year for 1982, while the singles &quot;King&quot;/&quot;Food for Thought&quot; and &quot;My Way of Thinking&quot; were at numbers 14 and 18 respectively in the equivalent singles of the year list. &quot;Sounds&quot; placed &quot;King&quot;/&quot;Food for Thought&quot; at number 8 in its end of year rankings for singles of the year, while &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked the same single at number 22 in its own list.

In June 2000 the British monthly music magazine &quot;Q&quot; placed &quot;Signing Off&quot; at number 83 in its critics&#x27; list of the &quot;100 Greatest British Albums Ever&quot;. The album is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, the only UB40 album to feature.

==Track listing==
All tracks written by UB40 except where noted. On some versions of the album, such as the US CD release, &quot;Burden of Shame&quot; is credited to UB40 and Van Morrison after the similarities to Morrison&#x27;s own song &quot;Moondance&quot; had been noted, but on both the original 1980 release and the 2010 reissue the song is credited solely to UB40.

<text>Richard &quot;Racehorse&quot; Haynes (April 3, 1927 – April 28, 2017) was a Texas criminal defense attorney. He became a star of the legal world after prevailing in a series of seemingly impossible murder trials in Texas in the 1970s and 1980s. Time magazine named him one of the top defense attorneys in the nation.

==Law practice==
A native of Houston, Texas, Haynes graduated from the University of Houston Law Center in 1956, and was admitted to the State Bar of Texas on April 23, 1956. During one stretch, he reportedly won 163 drunk-driving cases in a row. He was involved in landmark cases such as The State of Texas v. John Hill (a basis for journalist and author Thomas Thompson&#x27;s 1976 book &quot;Blood and Money&quot;), and the notorious T. Cullen Davis murder and later solicitation of murder trials in Fort Worth, Texas, both of which ended in acquittals. He also represented Morganna, a.k.a. &quot;The Kissing Bandit&quot;, and Vicki Daniel, who was the wife of Price Daniel Jr. His successful defense of Vicki Daniel established battered woman syndrome as a legal defense in the state of Texas.

Haynes said the secret to his legal advocacy was to have the answer to any prospective question from a judge or prosecutor or if an answer wasn&#x27;t at the ready, be prepared to change the subject. At an American Bar Association seminar in New York in the late 1970s, Haynes explained how to plead in the alternative: &quot;Say you sue me because you claim my dog bit you. Well now, this is my defense: My dog doesn&#x27;t bite. And second, in the alternative, my dog was tied up that night. And third, I don&#x27;t believe you really got bit. And fourth, I don&#x27;t have a dog.&quot;

When he first began practicing law, Haynes would sometimes ask his clients to thank the judge and jury after their acquittal. He ended the practice after one client said, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank each and every one of you. And I promise you that I will never, ever do it again.&quot;

Haynes once cross-examined an empty chair when the prosecution failed to call a key witness. His courtroom theatrics included shocking himself with a cattle prod to make a point. In defending a biker gang that had nailed a woman to a tree, Haynes planned to drive a nail into his hand to show the jury it wasn&#x27;t that painful, but changed his mind at the last second. Such flamboyant tactics comprised a small part of Haynes&#x27; legal strategy, however. As journalist Gary Cartwright declared: &quot;[Trials] are won through careful attention to detail and by hard scientific analysis of situations and evidence. Haynes prepares himself for a case by cramming down books and articles on criminology, pathology, ballistics, psychology, crime-scene investigative technique, whatever is called in for a particular case.&quot;

==Military record==
Haynes served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. During the Battle of Iwo Jima, Haynes was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for pulling two wounded and drowning Marines from the water after their landing craft overturned.

After receiving an accounting degree from the University of Houston in 1951, he was drafted back into military service, serving in the United States Army as a paratrooper and hand-to-hand combat instructor with the 11th Airborne Division during the Korean War.

==Personal life==
Haynes was born in Houston, where he later established his law practice. His father was a plasterer who struggled financially, so at the age of 2 Haynes was sent to San Antonio to live with his grandmother, where he stayed until he was 8 years old.

At 5&#x27;7&quot; in height, Haynes was an excellent boxer. He was the Texas amateur welterweight champion in the 1940s.

A football coach gave Haynes the nickname &quot;Racehorse&quot;. The coach said Haynes couldn&#x27;t carry the ball through the opposing team&#x27;s line but ran toward the sideline &quot;like a racehorse&quot;.

In 1979, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Haynes died on April 28, 2017, in Livingston, Texas.

==In books and movies==
G.W. Bailey appeared as Haynes in the 1981 film &quot;Murder in Texas&quot;, which is based in the events arising from the death of Joan Robinson Hill.
Dennis Franz appeared as Haynes in the 1995 film &quot;Texas Justice&quot;, which is based on the book &quot;Blood Will Tell&quot; by Gary Cartwright. One of the tracks on Tom Russell&#x27;s 2003 album Modern Art, simply entitled Racehorse Haynes, deals with his career.

<doc id="447391" wikidata="Q47571" url="?curid=447391" title="Lorca, Spain">
<text>Lorca () is a municipality and city in the autonomous community of the Region of Murcia in south-eastern Spain, southwest of the city of Murcia. The municipality had a population of 95,515 in 2020, up from the 2001 census total of 77,477. Lorca has the second largest surface area of municipalities in Spain, , after Cáceres. The city is home to Lorca Castle and to a Collegiate church dedicated to St. Patrick.

In the Middle Ages Lorca was a frontier city between Christian and Muslim Spain. Earlier, during the Roman period, it was the ancient Ilura or Heliocroca.

The city was seriously damaged by a magnitude 5.1 earthquake on 11 May 2011, killing at least nine people. Due to a shallow hypocenter, the earthquake was much more destructive than usual for earthquakes with similar magnitude.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and Antiquity ===
Archaeological excavations in the Lorca area have revealed that it has been inhabited continuously since Neolithic times, 5,500 years ago. The earliest permanent settlement is in the Guadalentín River valley, likely because of the presence of water sources, mineral resources, and the strategic positiom along a natural communication route with Andalusia. On the hillside below the castle and the town archaeological digs have revealed the remains of an important population of the &quot;El Argar&quot; culture during the Bronze Age.
During the Roman period, a settlement here was called &quot;Eliocroca&quot;, detailed in the Antonine Itinerary and located right on Via Augusta. Elicroca was important enough to become a bishopric, suffragan of the primatial Metropolitan Archbishopric of Toledo, but this status would be lost under Islam.

=== Feudal and modern era ===
In 713, the Teodomiro Pact was signed, referring to the city and its domains with the name &quot;Lurqa&quot;. Under this pact, the population was integrated into an autonomous Christian state, along with six other cities, governed by Theudimer (Teodomiro). These political arrangements lasted until his death. Then a Muslim reorganization of the state took place, carried out by Abb-al-Rahman II, who turned the territory into a Córdoba dependency. This led to the formation of the Taifa kingdoms, with the Taifa of Lorca as one of these kingdoms, first created in 1042, when Lorca declared its independence from the emirate of Valencia. Its first governor was Ma&#x27;n Ibn Sumadih, its power extending from the city to Jaén and Baza. During the Arab period it was known as &quot;Lurka&quot; and the old part of the town, made up of narrow streets and alley-ways, achieved its present shape under Moorish rule. The eminent scholar of the Almoravid-era, Ibn Atiyyah Andalusi of Granada passed away in the town in the year 542A.H corresponding to around the year 1147. 
The taifa was shortly recreated in 1228, after the fall of the Almoravids, until it conquered by the Taifa of Murcia; in 1244, Fernando III, King of Castilla y León and his son and heir, Prince Alfonso, the future Alfonso X of Castile, conquered Lorca. The main tower of the fortress of Lorca was named &quot;Torre Alfonsina&quot; in honour of the King. The city continued to grow, as in Arab times, and became the main town in an emerging rich agricultural region, although the border hindered economic development.

Lorca, known as the city of 100 Coat of Arms, is where the Moors and the Visigoths battled for control of the land; initially they both controlled the land up to the border on the north including the city of Larcia while in later years, the Christians and the Moors controlled the city and the land up to the southern border.

During the late Middle Ages, Lorca was a dangerous border town, spearhead of the Christian kingdom of Murcia (belonging to the Castilian crown) against the Moorish Emirate of Granada. Lorca served as a base for launching raids into enemy territory. The Battle of Los Alporchones, took place here in 1452, during the reign of Juan II of Castile, who ten years earlier had granted the Lorca the title of &quot;ciudad.&quot; The Kingdom of Murcia took Granada in 1492.

After the threat of war with Granada disappeared, the city changed in appearance, carrying out a series of urban reforms and developing trade. The numerous public works to be carried out attracted labourers from elsewhere, resulting in an increase in the population to 8,000 people. Among the new buildings include the Colegiata de San Patricio, erected in 1553, which is the religious centre of the city, as well as numerous convents, such as La Merced, Santo Domingo and San Francisco.

In the seventeenth century, Lorca took shape as a modern city, but still had defensive duties due to the Ottoman threat along the coast.
This century witnessed the expulsion of the Moors, the plague, which killed half the population, and droughts and locust plagues. Nevertheless, from 1660 a spectacular recovery and development began; amongst the construction of new buildings was the Palacio de Guevara, built in 1694 and a fine example of baroque architecture. The eighteenth century is of vital importance for the city, being one of the regions favoured by the Bourbon reforms. Lorca truly became a modern city, losing its medieval character. The population grew, and urban sprawl began as immigrants settled in the suburbs of San Cristóbal and San José. The defensive wall disappeared, which is indicative of the greater security of the times. The city became a haven for painters, sculptors and engravers.

On 30 April 1802, a great calamity struck the town of Lorca. The walls of a nearby reservoir gave way, flooding the town and destroying many buildings and killing up to 700 people. In the nineteenth century, the War of Independence and yellow fever epidemics and recurring droughts brought famine to the region and brought about the emigration of more than twelve thousand people. By 1845 Lorca had become the largest and most populous municipality in Murcia. Trade declined during the first half of the century, although in 1865 it received its first steam engine, the Sewer-Lorca railway opened in 1885 and the Baza-Lorca railway opened in 1890, bringing integration of the region in the domestic market, enabling the movement of mineral deposits and people. Restoration in the late 19th century brought with it a period of prosperity and political calm, the roundabouts of San Vicente, the Teatro y Colón, the Casino Artístico y Literario in 1885, the Teatro Guerra in 1861, and the Plaza de Toros in 1892, etc. were amongst the notable building developments of this time. The 1878 edition of &quot;The Globe Encyclopaedia of Universal Information&quot; described Lorca (spelled as&quot; &#x27;Liorca&#x27;)&quot; thus:
: a town of Spain, province of Murcia, on the Sangonera, W. of Carthagena. It has an old Moorish castle, and manufactures of silks, soap, dye-stuffs, leather, paper, etc... Near Liorca are important lead mines. Pop. 40,000.

In the early twentieth century, intensive exploitation of mineral deposits of the coastal zone meant a revival of economic life in the region. The Spanish Civil War paradoxically brought about the beginning of population recovery, but in the post-World War II years the population stagnated as a result of emigration. But today the flow has been reversed: the leather, pottery, cement and butcheries make the municipality an agricultural and livestock industrial tone, involving a large percentage of the population. The twentieth century in Lorca has been a technological take-off, with slow and gradual change of social structures, the specialization of the productive sectors, etc.

On October 19, 1973, Lorca and Puerto Lumbreras suffered a terrible flood that took more than 50 lives.

In 2002, during archeological excavations of the Lorca Castle, the old Judería, or Jewish quarter, was uncovered, including the Synagogue of Lorca, which was one of the few synagogues in Spain that was not converted into a church after the expulsion of the Jews. Items found during the excavation can be viewed at the Lorca Archeological Museum, including menorahs and other judaica.

On January 29, 2005, an earthquake of 4.6 magnitude on the Richter scale with epicentre in the districts of La Paca (1,068 inhabitants in 2005) and Zarcilla de Ramos (1,077 inhabitants in 2005), caused damage especially in the structure of various buildings, and in Avilés, Coy, Doña Inés, Don Gonzalo, El Pardo, La Canaleja and Zarzadilla de Totana. This was however to be topped by worse.

In 2008, Lorca received the annual Honorary Diploma of Europe Awards from the Council of Europe.

===2011 earthquake===
The town was seriously damaged by a magnitude 5.3 earthquake on 11 May 2011, killing at least nine people.
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said the larger earthquake had a preliminary 5.3 magnitude, it was so superficial that the magnitude was like a 7 magnitude normal earthquake, and struck south-southeast of Madrid at 6:47 p.m. (1647 GMT, 12:47 p.m. EDT). The quake was about 1 km (0.6 mi) deep, and was preceded by the smaller one with a 4.5 magnitude in the same spot.

Lorca Castle, a fortress of medieval origin constructed between the 9th and 15th centuries suffered serious damages to its walls and the Espolón Tower during this earthquake.

== Titular see of Elicroca ==
The Ancient diocese was nominally restored as a titular see in 1969.
It has had the following incumbents, of both the lowest (episcopal) and intermediary (archiepiscopal) ranks :
* Titular Archbishop Paul Clarence Schulte (1970.01.03 – 1984.02.17)
* Titular Bishop Héctor Julio López Hurtado, Salesians (S.D.B.) (1987.12.15 – 1999.10.29)
* Titular Bishop Manuel Neto Quintas, Dehonians (S.C.I.) (2000.06.30 – 2004.04.22)
* Titular Bishop Matthias König (2004.10.14 – ...), Auxiliary Bishop of Paderborn

== Geography and climate ==

The town is situated at an elevation of in eastern Spain between Granada and Murcia. It was part of the hura of Tidmir in the Muslim period when it became well known for its fertile soil and subsoil, and for its strategic location. It is situated on the southern slopes of the Siera del Cano mountains. The Guadalentín River flows through the town.

The municipality of Lorca is bound by Caravaca de la Cruz and Cehegín to the north, Mula, Aledo, Totana and Mazarrón to the east, Águilas to the south and Pulpí, Puerto Lumbreras, Huércal-Overa, Vélez Rubio and Vélez Blanco to the east. The town of Lorca itself is located southwest of the city of Murcia and roughly north of the coastal town of Aguilas. Lorca is connected to Puerto Lumbreras in the southwest by European Route 15 (Route A-7) and the village of Barranco del Prado just to the north. Beyond this the C-3211 road connects it to the city of Caravaca de la Cruz much further to the north.
Several towns and villages lie in the municipality, including La Paca, Palm Zarcilla, Avilés, Coy, Doña Inés, Don Gonzalo, El Pardo, La Canaleja and Zarzadilla de Totana.

The municipality is very large at and has a range of geographical features, extending from the coastline to the mountainous areas of the northwest and northeast of the municipality. Lorca formed around the Guadalentín River (in Arabic &quot;mud river&quot;) in an arid valley. In fact, agriculture heavily depends on water transferred from the Tagus river in Central Spain. Irrigation channels were laid out all over the country by the Moors during the Middle Ages. These agricultural plains lie to the south of the main town in the valley, a strip which expands into the western part of the municipality. The area to the north is mountainous; to the northeast is the Parque Natural Sierra Espuna.

===Districts of Lorca===
Lorca is divided into these districts:
===Beaches of Lorca===
The municipality of Lorca extends to the Mediterranean. There are many beaches in its litoral stretch of the coast line surrounded by hills with coves with sparse to dense vegetation. Some of the popular beaches are: The Calnegre, a sand beach, 1200 m long and 20 m wide, is peaceful with the calm sea; Cala Leña, part of the Blana Cove with backdrop of hills covered with good vegetation and facing crystal clear sea water; El Ciscar, a gravel beach surrounded by low hills; El Muerto beach with volcanic black sand and rock faces; La Galera gravel beach in the backdrop of a cove and rock cliffs covered by vegetation; Los Hierros, a gravel beach; Larga beach, a 500 m wide gravel beach; and La Junquera, a small gravely beach with rocky landforms. Calnegre beach is one of the best beaches in Spain

===Climate===
Lorca has a cold desert climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BWk&quot;) closely bordering on a hot desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;), with mild winters and hot summers, while precipitation is scarce throughout the year. It is one of the driest cities in Spain and Europe, as well as one of very few areas with a desert climate. During the winter, temperatures below occasionally occur, while on summer temperatures above are common, with peaks above .

== Notable landmarks ==
===Lorca Castle===
The Lorca Castle, which overlooks the city of Lorca from a strategic location, and is thus distinctly visible from a distance, was built by the Moorish inhabitants during the 13th century. Its history dates back to the Islamic period when it was built between 8th and 12th centuries; some remnants of which are still seen in the form of water systems in the older part of the castle. The Alfonsí Tower is of a rectangular shape which is built in the castle. The castle has a polygonal floor plan. The tower has three sections. Gothic vaulted ceilings are seen in its three sections. It also has the Espolón Tower. During the final stages of Christian reconquest, the Moors had taken refuge in the castle. Alphonse tower was added to the fort defences when Alfonso X had retaken the city in 1243 provided security to the turrets and crenels of the fort. The castle is now a popular place for holding fiestas and civic functions. The castle is also transformed into a theme park with fine display of &quot;dioramas, actors in costumes and various gadgetry.&quot;

===Plaza de España===

== Economy ==

After most of the land and water supplies had been held for centuries by a minority of landowners and by Roman Catholic religious orders, Lorca began a period of sluggish economic growth during the 1960s.

Still today, its economy is largely based on agriculture and stock breeding (pigs and brown cows), although its service industries make it the commercial capital of the surrounding area. The economy of the town is thus dependent largely on export of pork products and textiles. It also has saltpetre, gunpowder, and lead-smelting works. In recent years, Lorca has experienced a population growth because of peasant immigration, mostly coming from Ecuador and Morocco.

Lorca has launched a programme to boost its economy by attracting local, national and international industrial houses to set up base in the city and its precincts by identifying land for allotment to set up industrial parks, Research and Development (R&amp;D) projects. Some of the important recent actions taken by the Lorca City Hall relate to allotment of of land for development through 60 local entrepreneurial projects, to promote investments that would create employment and maximize the Lorca economy, allotted to Turkish investors to develop corporate projects, approval of land programmes for development of Serrata Industrial Park by the Lorca Land and Housing firm (SUVILOR) to develop five parks, setup Health Sciences University Campus for the 2010–2011 under agreements with Israeli firms. Further advantages cited for firms to set up their establishments in Lorca are the approved plans for the allotment of land of in Hoya in Purias and the identification of land for Zarcilla de Ramos, Zarzadilla de Totana, La Paca and Almendricos for development of industries.

The Region of Murcia, the City Council of Lorca, the Chamber of Commerce of Lorca and the Confederation of Entrepreneurs of the Region of Lorca (Ceclor), as a consortium, have formed the LORCATUR to develop cultural tourism of Lorca. The emphasis is on promoting urban tourist circuits and thematic itineraries. To this end, plans have been taken up to conserve, preserve and restore the built heritage of the city, regenerate urban areas for residents and tourists, and diversify the historical and cultural heritage.

== Cultural activity ==

Cultural activity in Lorca is the Easter celebration, the Holy Week celebration popularly known as the Semana Santa. Semana Santa festival has been popularised since 1855. It is said to be the best festival held anywhere in Spain where two brotherhoods vie with each other to display two colours namely the Azul (blue) and Blanco (white) for the highly competitive festive display of cloaks. Each of the brotherhood in Lorca, on this occasion, carries an image of Virgin Mary – one draped in a blue cloak and another in white cloak with a banner and a museum. Music played on this occasion is of a different rhythm is reverential and vigorously mixing the story of Old Testament and the New Testament. Apart from this annual festival, there are four small museums where exhibits of Semana Santa costumes are on display. These costumes are finely embroidered on silk and depict historical and religious scenes; some of these cloaks are as long as . Fiesta celebration for La Virgen de Las Huertas is held on 8 September every year.

<doc id="447395" wikidata="Q44606" url="?curid=447395" title="Gackt">
<text>, better known by his mononymous stage name Gackt (stylized in all caps), is a Japanese singer, musician, songwriter, and actor.

Born in Okinawa to a Ryukyuan family, Gackt learned the piano at a young age and was raised on classical music and enka before becoming interested in rock music while attending high school. He has been active since 1993, first as the frontman of the short-lived independent band Cains:Feel, and then from 1995 the now-defunct visual kei rock band Malice Mizer. Gackt started his solo career in 1999 with debut mini-album &quot;Mizérable&quot; and first full-length album &quot;Mars&quot; (2000). He has released nine studio albums and, with forty-eight singles released, holds the male soloist record for most top ten consecutive singles in Japanese music history. They are mostly conceived around two conceptual stories &quot;Moon Saga&quot; (&quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot;, &quot;Diabolos&quot;, &quot;Last Moon&quot;) and &quot;Requiem et Reminiscence&quot; (&quot;Rebirth&quot;, &quot;&quot;) which are performed live in uniquely elaborate concerts. His single &quot;Returner (Yami no Shūen)&quot; (2007), is his first and only single to reach the number one spot on the Oricon charts. As a solo artist, Gackt has sold over 10 million records. In 2007 became a founding member of S.K.I.N., a Japanese visual kei rock supergroup, and in 2010 formed his own band project Yellow Fried Chickenz.

Besides being established in the modern entertainment industry and considered a pop icon, Gackt&#x27;s music has been used as theme songs for video games (&quot;Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII&quot;), video game films (&quot;Dragon Age: Dawn of the Seeker&quot;), anime series/films (&quot;New Fist of the North Star&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;, &quot;Texhnolyze&quot; and &quot;Trickster&quot;) and television series (&quot;Kamen Rider Decade&quot;). In addition to his music career, Gackt has voice acted (including characters inspired by him in video games like in &quot;Bujingai&quot; and Genesis Rhapsodos in &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot;), and live acted in a few films, including a film he wrote, &quot;Moon Child&quot;, his international debut &quot;Bunraku&quot;, Japan Academy award nomination performance for Best Actor in &quot;Fly Me to the Saitama&quot;, and TV series most notably as Uesugi Kenshin in the NHK drama &quot;Fūrin Kazan&quot;. He also performed live in theatre stage plays, &quot;Nemuri Kyoshiro Buraihikae&quot; and a duology he has written, composed, and directed &quot;Moon Saga: Mysteries of Yoshitsune I &amp; II&quot;. He also provided the voice samples for Internet Co., Ltd.&#x27;s first Vocaloid, Gackpoid.

==Early life==
Gackt was born on July 4, 1973, as the second of three children in a Ryukyuan family, in Okinawa of the Ryukyu Islands, Japan. His father was a music teacher, who primarily played the trumpet, and his mother was also a teacher. Gackt has an older sister and a younger brother. He lived in Okinawa until he was 7 years old (with short periods when was 16 and 26), because of his father&#x27;s job, living in many different cities on Honshu and Kyushu islands in addition to Okinawa: Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, Shiga, Osaka, and Kyoto. He studied in the Moriyama High School in Shiga, and was enrolled in the Kyoto Gakuen University.

Gackt&#x27;s musical education began at age three when his parents initiated his classical piano education. At age seven, continuing his classical piano education became more difficult because of time spent at elementary school and the repeated change of instructors due to relocating from city to city. It would take another four years until his parents allowed him to quit lessons. However, after losing a piano competition to a boy he met in the middle school, Gackt voluntarily returned to his piano studies, even writing orchestral scores. He has credited the classical pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin with being &quot;the one who taught me the beauty, depth, fun, sadness, the kindness of music; that music could grant people courage, and the meaning of the layers of sound. It isn&#x27;t an exaggeration to say Chopin is the foundation of my music&quot;. Since his father played the trumpet, Gackt is also familiar with brass instruments. Having only listened to classical music and enka while growing up, he did not become interested in rock music until high school, and went on to master modern percussion.

==Music career==
===1993–1998: First musical efforts and Malice Mizer===
In the early 1990s, Gackt was working as a host and dealer in a casino, while also being an assistant drummer for an amateur band. At the time he wanted to become more serious about his music activity but had a negative perspective on life. While at the casino, he met a businessman who inspired him to find a purpose in life, that being music. About a year later he left the band and he found himself working multiple jobs, among them as a sound technician at a studio where he could practice drums. When Gackt was twenty-years old, he met guitarist You Kurosaki, his future solo career support guitarist, at a music live house in Kyoto. They formed the band, Cains:Feel, whose name had biblical reference to the story of Cain and Abel. The group lacked a vocalist, so Gackt became the frontman, and the band went to record a demo tape before disbanding.

In 1995, he was introduced to the visual kei band Malice Mizer which was on hiatus due to the departure of their frontman Tetsu. Gackt moved to Tokyo and joined them in October 1995. As their vocalist, pianist and primary lyricist on studio albums &quot;Voyage Sans Retour&quot; (1996) and &quot;Merveilles&quot; (1998), he also contributed three songs in their catalog, &quot;Regret&quot;, &quot;Hamon&quot; and &quot;Le Ciel&quot;, the latter being their most successful single as a band.

During this time, the band&#x27;s fame soared; and, after four years and two studio albums, in January 1999, it was officially announced that he left the band. According to his interviews and autobiography, the issues with the management office, members&#x27; differences, and his isolation from the band led to his departure.

===1999–2001: Solo debut, &quot;Mizérable&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;, and &quot;Rebirth&quot;===
Gackt launched his solo career on January 1, 1999. After completing his recordings, his first gig as a solo artist was the 99 Gackt Resurrection tour held in 11 locations across Japan. It was followed on May 12 with his debut release, the extended play &quot;Mizérable&quot;, released by Nippon Crown. The album peaked at number two, spending 12 weeks on the Oricon charts.

Gackt recalls that Kenshin was always portrayed as a very tough man.

The second &quot;Moon&quot; stage theatre adaptation ran from August until October 2014, with 40 performances in seven cities, notable for the first major use of projection mapping in theatre stage plays.

==Artistry==
===Voice===
Gackt has a low-pitched voice, with a vibrato pitch at D3-D4, and is capable of using falsetto like for example in song &quot;Ares&quot; and &quot;4th&quot; among others. In his songs he shows wide range and often sings in both low and high notes in the same song, sometimes also adding the falsetto. According to Gackt, he had expanded the vocal range too much between 2003 and 2004, and searched for a right expression until 2005, since when he has been getting more straightforward. His voice was described as &quot;very melodramatic&quot;, as well as &quot;smooth, sleek, unnaturally heartfelt&quot;, &quot;velvet&quot; and &quot;molasses&quot;.

===Songwriting===
His songs range from melodic ballads to intense hard rock songs, in which he masterfully combines &quot;raw rock elements&quot; with &quot;listener-friendly compositions&quot;. Josephine Yun in &quot;A Concise Report on 40 of the Biggest Rock Acts in Japan&quot; (2005) noted his &quot;talent for orchestration and for blending classical elements into the rock genre ... and his style ranges from romantically classical to experimental and unfolding progressive rock&quot;. Many songs, like for example &quot;Mind Forest&quot;, &quot;Metamorphoze&quot;, &quot;Returner (Yami no Shūen)&quot;, and those related to the album &quot;Last Moon&quot;, are distinctive for their blend of modern Western musical instruments and traditional Japanese musical instruments, a kind of music called by Gackt as &quot;Zipangu rock&quot; from which can be sensed it originates from Japan.

Gackt often &quot;stressed the beauty and importance of Japanese lyrics&quot;, writing &quot;all of his music and lyrics to quality, not quantity&quot;. He uses double meaning words, and lyrics are &quot;meaningful and heartfelt&quot;. They also deal with emotions of sadness, kindness, coexistence, beauty, fragility, depth of love for others and loneliness among many others.

His process of writing songs and making concerts is by first writing the story, then writing and composing the songs based on it with a specific image in the live performance. It results in songs that are conceptually related, but still independent from each other. Most of his studio albums are conceived around two conceptual stories: story of &quot;Moon Saga&quot; (&quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot;, &quot;Diabolos&quot;, &quot;Last Moon&quot;), set in Asia (mostly Japan) and Europe is a vampire story although by itself it is not, as the vampires were presented as a way of expressing a certain evil side and existence of humans. The theme is based around the existential questions of humanity, a symbolical and psychological story about the repetition of human sins, war and the question of what is the ultimate meaning of human life; and story of &quot;Requiem et Reminiscence&quot; or short &quot;ЯR&quot; (&quot;Rebirth&quot;, &quot;&quot;), which is set in Nazi Germany during the World War II and questions where humans start and end and why at the same time destructive and loving, humanity decides to start wars.

===Performances===
Gackt is known for his unique concerts, which he wants to preserve as works of art. His conceptual kind of concerts related to &quot;Moon Saga&quot; and &quot;Requiem et Reminiscence&quot; are different from typical music concerts neither they fit in the usual categories of a musical or a theatre play. Thus Gackt calls them &quot;Visualive&quot;, because they are formed by a story, music, movies, theatre and musical elements, as well as live performance (with Gackt &quot;acting&quot; as the story protagonist). The shows are elaborately divided into two basic parts, conceptual and entertainment, which can be further divided into four parts, firstly is introduction concept movie followed by first set of concept songs, secondly has stage clothes change and second set of concept songs, thirdly after a video of relief has a separate set of songs and MC with audience engaging in playful entertainment, and fourthly has ending conceptual performance and closing movie. Reviewers described them as rock spectacles with a teartful story that will make the audience wishing for a peaceful world. During the performance of &quot;Rain&quot; on 2002 and 2003 tours had the water drops falling like a rain from the ceiling onto the stage. His final performance of &quot;Diabolos&quot; tour in 2005 at Tokyo Dome (costing roughly $4.3 million) received praise and shocked the audience, as included entering the arena on a horseback in full gallop with four other horse riders, in a suspended coffin during &quot;Lust for Blood&quot;, singing &quot;Love Letter&quot; hanging 20m in the air, and disappearing in a sudden smoke explosion. The 2008-09 &quot;&quot; and 2016 &quot;Last Visualive - Last Moon&quot; tour concerts lasted up to four hours.

The Visualive concert format was originally created during the &quot;Requiem et Reminiscence&quot; tour in 2001, and according to Gackt, it took him almost ten years to arrive to a satisfying point of form during the &quot;Requiem et Reminiscence II&quot; tour in 2008-2009. However, he found such way of expression as difficult and physically and mentally exhausting, with a profitability that is not in accordance with the demands of entertainment industry. By 2007 he had a lot of requests to tour worldwide, but such large-scale shows are difficult to have in foreign countries and need significant logistical support for transportation.

Similarly his &quot;Camui Gakuen&quot; festival shows (2009-2019) have Gackt performing cover versions conceptualized around a same-titled fictional school where Gackt acts as the student council president wearing a school uniform. He can be seen cross-dressing as a female, being a drummer of SEX Japan (pun on Yoshiki and his band X Japan), or a guitarist of The Balue Hearts (pun on The Blue Hearts) among others. Gackt&#x27;s example of a more typical concert is &quot;D.r.u.g. Party&quot; tour (2006-2007) featuring his rock songs, with Oricon review noting his eroticism and charisma while performing, and Gackt considering it his and worldwide&#x27;s pinnacle of an all-out androgynous style by a man.

==Cultural status==
Gackt is considered a Japanese pop and fashion icon, J-pop/J-rock superstar and Japanese idol, and due to his involvement with the visual kei movement, which emphasizes androgynous and changing appearance, he is referred to as a &quot;living manifestation of readers&#x27; fantasy men&quot; found in bishōnen manga. &quot;Otaku USA&quot; magazine in 2007 stated &quot;His &#x27;more than human&#x27; appearance and persona were a hit with the mass media in Japan. It was as if a fictitious character suddenly popped out in the real world&quot;. He has been compared to fictional characters like Griffith from &quot;Berserk&quot;, Cloud Strife and Squall Leonhart from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, as well as having been an inspiration for manga characters. In his late career his appearance changed to more &quot;macho&quot;.

Gackt became associated with Japanese daimyo Uesugi Kenshin who he played in NHK Taiga drama &quot;Fūrin Kazan&quot;. Gackt was subsequently invited to act as Kenshin at Jōetsu city&#x27;s traditional 82nd Kenshin Festival in August 2007. In August 2010 he participated in the 85th Kenshin Festival for the third time, with a record attendance of more than 240,000 visitors. Four more times he reprised the role in the festival, with a new record high number of 243,000 visitors in August 2015.

Gackt&#x27;s sex appeal has been noted by national polls, such as by Oricon, similar to those done by &quot;People&quot;. He often ranked highly in beauty listings, as the most or one of the most beautiful/sexiest Japanese men, celebrities or artists. In 2009, he was also ranked fifth among rock music personalities in Japanese history. Gackt on several occasions served as a fashion model (including for Yoshiyuki Konishi), producer and designer. In the first half of his career he had own jewelry &amp; sunglasses brand Darts. In 2002 received Japan Glasses Best Dressed Award, and in 2003 Best Dressed Award by Japan Men&#x27;s Fashion Association. In 2007 at the China Fashion Week in Shanghai received award for the Japanese Fashion Artist of the Year.

Over the years, Gackt appeared as a performer, guest and regular member on several television variety shows, including &quot;Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ&quot;, and since 2009, TV Asahi&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s special &quot;Geinoujin-Kakuzuke-Check&quot; (Celebrity Rating Check), where he holds the record of 71 individual winning streaks, building an image of a top connoisseur and &quot;first-class entertainer&quot;. Gackt was one of the judges of Japan&#x27;s first season of Got Talent show which premiered on February 11, 2023.

Gackt appeared in many television commercials, including for Fujifilm, Shiseido, Daihatsu, Niconico, Tsutaya, Square Enix, and Konami, among others. From July 2014 to August 2016 in collaboration with Nestlé Japan was started a gaming channel &quot;Game Center&quot; with daily video release of Gackt playing video games, gathering more than 15 million views in first season alone. In 2019 became ambassador for PUBG Mobile in Japan, a collaboration that until 2023 saw him contributing original models of himself, skin outfits which wore in his career, weapon skins and voice pack.

On December 14, 2010 he participated in and performed in a Hohoemi project charity event called &quot;Message! to Asia&quot;, by DATV at Tokyo Dome, whose profits were planned to help street children in Cambodia and the Philippines. For an auction at the event, he auctioned his custom 1999 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am MS6, which was sold for ().

In 2011, because of the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Gackt founded the &quot;Show Your Heart&quot; charity for collecting money to buy supplies for the victims. In March, a truck convoy with of food and clothes was delivered and a nationwide street-corner fund-raising campaign was held, with Gackt&#x27;s participation, which collected (or ).

Gackt is and feels pride in being an ethnic &quot;Uchinanchu&quot; i.e. Ryukyuan. When he was young he experienced discrimination for it in Japan but it did not have a negative effect on him. He reportedly also experienced discrimination in a Paris hotel in 2015 for being Asian. His stated life and music goal is giving people hope, connecting them and uniting Asian countries.

When he was 20 years old, Gackt was briefly married to a South Korean woman, and his &quot;last big love affair&quot; which ended in 2014 was reportedly with Japanese-born South Korean singer Lee Ahyumi.

Gackt has lived for most of his life in Tokyo, Japan.

<text>Jeffrey Zeldman is an American entrepreneur, web designer, author, podcaster and speaker on web design. He is the co-founder of A List Apart Magazine and the Web Standards Project. He also founded the design studios Happy Cog and studio.zeldman, and co-founded the A Book Apart imprint and the design conference An Event Apart.

==Early life==
Jeffrey Zeldman was born on January 12, 1955, in Queens, New York, to the robotics engineer Maurice Zeldman and his wife Phyllis Sylvia Zeldman. When he was four years of age, his family moved to Long Island. When he was eight, they moved to Connecticut, and at age thirteen, they moved to Pittsburgh. He earned an undergraduate degree from University of Indiana, and an MFA in fiction writing from University of Virginia.

==Career==
Jeffrey Zeldman briefly worked as a reporter for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and ten years as an advertising copywriter before turning to web design in 1995. He rose to prominence as an authority on web design in the second half of the nineties by advocating a middle ground between the aesthetically oriented position of David Siegel and the functionally oriented position of Jakob Nielsen, viewing function and aesthetics as complementary rather than polar opposites. In 1998, he co-founded the Web Standards Project with George Olsen and Glenn Davis, serving as project leader from 1999 to 2002. His persistent activism for the adoption of web standards has since earned him accolades such as &quot;standards champion,&quot; &quot;godfather of web standards,&quot; and &quot;a foremost advocate for the potential of the web.&quot;

== Web publications ==
Zeldman has maintained his personal website, Zeldman.com, since 1995, initially featuring a blend of web design tips, opinion, and entertainment. In the early years, the site included a humorous treatise on Lawrence Welk, free icons and backgrounds for visitors to use, and a web design tutorial titled &quot;Ask Dr. Web&quot;. The site&#x27;s Daily Report subsequently became &quot;a fountain of information regarding standards-compliant design.&quot;

In 1998, Zeldman co-launched &quot;A List Apart&quot;, a web magazine which explores the design, development, and meaning of web content, with a focus on the techniques and benefits of designing with web standards. Among his many contributions to &quot;A List Apart&quot;, his article &quot;To Hell with Bad Browsers,&quot; published in February 2001, has been cited as a turning point in the adoption of Cascading Style Sheets for their intended purpose of articulating layouts.

Zeldman also co-hosts &quot;The Big Web Show&quot;, a podcast about the web and online publishing.

== Design agency ==
In 1999, Zeldman founded Happy Cog, a web and interaction design studio specializing in user-and content-focused, standards-compliant design. In 2016, Zeldman&#x27;s business association with Happy Cog ended, and he launched an independent design consultancy called Studio Zeldman.

== Print publications ==
Zeldman has authored two books, &quot;Taking your Talent to the Web&quot;, which was published in 2001, and &quot;Designing with Web Standards&quot;, which first came out in 2003, and appeared in two revised editions, one in 2007, and one in 2009. &quot;Designing with Web Standards&quot; reiterates many of the arguments made by the Web Standards Project to highlight the benefits of standards-compliant web design. Having been translated into thirteen languages, the book brought standards awareness to a new international audience.

In 2010, Zeldman expanded his publishing work beyond web magazines with the creation of the A Book Apart imprint. Its books are designed to be quick reads and treat advanced topics in web design with a strong point of view.

== Web Design Conference ==
In 2005, Zeldman and Eric A. Meyer founded An Event Apart, &quot;the design conference for people who make websites.&quot; An Event Apart is an &quot;intensely educational two-day learning session for passionate practitioners of standards-based web design&quot; followed by an optional day-long workshop on such topics as mobile web design, advanced accessible web design, HTML5, and CSS3. The conference currently takes place in seven cities annually. Cities and speakers vary. Speakers, in addition to offering informative content, must have made major contributions to web design or development in order to qualify to speak at the event.

== Innovations ==
Zeldman and Happy Cog were early advocates of standards-based web design and many of their current and former employees have greatly contributed to various initiatives on the web, including:
* The development of &quot;real type on the web&quot; via CSS and services including Typekit.
* Popularizing such ideas as CSS layout, responsive design, and style switching. The last of these was an early 2000 innovation which paved the way for later third-party innovations including CSS Zen Garden and a web site known as Readability.
* The second revised edition of &quot;Designing With Web Standards&quot;, issued in 2007, which famously showed Zeldman with a blue knit hat on its book cover, inspired Douglas Vos to invent the Blue Beanie Day, an annual international celebration of web standards which began in 2007.

==Personal life==
Zeldman has been teetotal since 1993.

<doc id="447401" wikidata="Q1122802" url="?curid=447401" title="HMS Liverpool (C11)">
<text>HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot;, named after the port city of Liverpool in north-west England, was a of the Royal Navy in service from 1938 to 1952.

During the Second World War, &quot;Liverpool&quot; gained four battle honours and was seriously damaged in two attacks by Italian torpedo bombers. The cruiser operated variously with the naval stations in the East Indies and China and with the Mediterranean and Home fleets. While assigned as flagship to the China Station in January 1940, the cruiser instigated a diplomatic incident with Japan when she intercepted the liner &quot;Asama Maru&quot; off the coast of Japan. &quot;Liverpool&quot; took part in the battles of the Espero Convoy and Calabria, the Arctic Convoys, and Operation Harpoon during the Malta Convoys. On 14 June 1942, during Operation Harpoon, &quot;Liverpool&quot; suffered an air attack and had to undergo repairs and refitting at Rosyth, Scotland for the remainder of the war.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; returned to service in 1945 and was assigned as flagship to the Mediterranean Fleet. In the early 1950s, the cruiser harboured in Port Said to support the British Administration of the Suez Canal Zone, when Egyptian guerrillas campaigned against it. The cruiser was decommissioned in 1952 at a time when the Royal Navy was rapidly contracting in strength. &quot;Liverpool&quot; was broken up in 1958, at Rosyth.

== Design and description ==

The Town-class light cruisers were designed as counters to the Japanese s built during the early 1930s and the second batch of three ships was enlarged, with the most powerful engines and widest beam of any post 1927 Royal Navy cruisers, to maintain speed and stability with the weight of, a second low angle main director (2) T284 LADCT, to give two channel fire control of the six inch turrets enabling, simultaneous engagement with surface targets fore and aft of the cruisers and to give a second level of deck armour over the top of the armour box around the four main magazines (In HMS Gloucester and the third &#x27;Belfast&#x27; group, the extra deck armour belt also extended further over the engines). &quot;Liverpool&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ship had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by four Parsons geared steam turbine sets, each driving one shaft, which developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . &quot;Liverpool&quot; also mounted a catapult with three Supermarine Walrus. Steam for the turbines was provided by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The ship carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave her a range of at . The ship&#x27;s complement was 800–850 officers and ratings.

The Town-class ships mounted twelve BL six-inch (152 mm) Mk XXIII guns in four triple-gun turrets. The turrets were designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. Their secondary armament consisted of eight QF Mk XVI dual-purpose guns in twin mounts. Their light anti-aircraft armament consisted of a pair of quadruple mounts for the two-pounder (40 mm) AA gun (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) and two quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machine guns. The ships carried two above-water, triple mounts for torpedoes.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armour belt. The sides of &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s boiler and engine rooms and the sides of the magazines were protected by of armour. The top of the magazines and the machinery spaces were protected by of armour. The armour protecting the main gun turrets had a thickness of 2–4 inches.

==History==

===Commission (1935–1939)===

Procured in response to the American and Japanese classes of light cruiser, the Town class consisted of three variants for a total of 10 ships. These ships were intended for fleet duties rather than trade protection, which their predecessors had been designed for. The class represented a significant improvement in armament and armour, which provided reasonable protection against shells. Their primary armament of twelve guns in triple turrets, compared to the eight and six guns possessed by the preceding and classes, still adhered to the constraints of the London Naval Treaty. &quot;Liverpool&quot; became one of the three Town-class cruisers—with and —ordered to a slightly revised design referred to as the &quot;Liverpool&quot;, &quot;Liverpool&quot;, or Type II sub-class. The second group retained an almost identical configuration, differentiated only by a beam enlarged to (compared to &quot;Southampton&quot;″s beam of ), a redesigned bridge, and improved fire control equipment.

Ordered under the 1935 estimates, the keel of &quot;Liverpool&quot; was laid down at Govan on 17 February 1936 and launched on 24 March 1937 by Priscilla Norman, wife of the Governor of the Bank of England Montagu Norman. &quot;Liverpool&quot; became the first cruiser launched at the Fairfield shipyard since the . After being commissioned into the navy on 2 November 1938, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was assigned to the East Indies Station under the command of Captain A.D. Read. Before the deployment, the cruiser visited her namesake port in January 1939. The Liverpool Woman&#x27;s Service Bureau presented the cruiser with a Union flag and White Ensign, while the city&#x27;s Corporation gave the crew &quot;three pairs of candlesticks, a silver cup, and two bugles&quot;. &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s crew had already received a silver bell and plate originally in the possession of her predecessor.

===East Indies and China stations (1939–1940)===
Before arriving in the East Indies, &quot;Liverpool&quot; prepared for the deployment in the Mediterranean for two months and had engine defects corrected. At the beginning of the Second World War, &quot;Liverpool&quot; formed part of the 4th Cruiser Squadron, which she left in November to transfer to the 5th Cruiser Squadron, China Station. While part of the station, the cruiser became involved in a diplomatic incident when she intercepted the Japanese passenger liner &quot;Asama Maru&quot; on 21 January 1940. Alerted to reports that German sailors in the United States had arranged transport to Germany, the British Government authorised the station&#x27;s commander-in-chief to direct a warship to board &quot;Asama Maru&quot; and detain suspected passengers, provided the procedure did not occur within sight of the coast of Japan. Just east of Niijima, off Honshū, &quot;Liverpool&quot; located the liner and removed 21 of the ship&#x27;s passengers, believed by the British to be survivors of the scuttled German liner . &quot;Asama Maru&quot; had been late and had deviated from her expected course, necessitating an operation much closer to Japan&#x27;s coast.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; discharged a warning shot across &quot;Asama Maru&quot;″s bows to compel the liner to halt, afterwards deploying 12 men to conduct the search. Four days after the incident, the NYK Line dismissed Captain Watanabe, under the pretense of retirement, accusing him of &quot;misconduct&quot;. The Government of Japan condemned the operation as an abuse of belligerent rights and formally protested the action, which further escalated tensions between the two countries. The Japanese and British governments sought to defuse the dispute through negotiation, and on 5 February, the two countries accepted a proposal which entailed the release of nine Germans in exchange for Japan pledging to deny military-age German citizens access to their vessels. In Australia&#x27;s official history of the war, it was said that the most senior of the nine Germans, Captain Groth, remarked during his passage to Japan aboard the armed merchant cruiser that the operation had been &quot;an excellent piece of work, and an action which would deter the remainder of the German crews still in the United States, approximately 1000 men, from making the passage&quot;.

In April, &quot;Liverpool&quot; became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Arthur Murray&#x27;s Red Sea Force, which was formed with the Australian cruiser . The Red Sea Force was intended to help execute naval strategy in the area by performing a variety of duties, such as patrols and blockade enforcement in the event of war with Italy. While in the area, &quot;Liverpool&quot; escorted a convoy transporting contingents from the Australian military to Suez. When ordered to the Mediterranean in June, &quot;Liverpool&quot; relinquished her status as flagship with the transfer of Admiral Murray to the New Zealand cruiser at Port Sudan. To accommodate the admiral and his staff, &quot;Leander&quot; transferred three officers and seven ratings to &quot;Liverpool&quot;.

===First torpedoing (1940–1941)===

&quot;Liverpool&quot; formed part of the 7th Cruiser Squadron, becoming one of nine cruisers that could be fielded by the Mediterranean Fleet shortly after Fascist Italy entered the war. She first encountered Italian vessels off the coast of Libya on 12 June 1940 while shelling positions near Tobruk with &quot;Gloucester&quot; and four destroyers. The cruisers attacked five vessels, including the obsolete armoured cruiser , and sank the minesweeper . On 28 June, a British Short Sunderland patrol aircraft detected three Italian destroyers west of Zante. The 7th Cruiser Squadron was at sea in support of convoy Operation MA.3 when it altered course to engage the destroyers. &quot;Liverpool&quot; sighted them south-west of Cape Matapan at 18:30 and opened fire three minutes later. The ensuing action, carried out at a minimum range of about , resulted in the destruction of the Italian &quot;Espero&quot; The two surviving destroyers reached Benghazi with their supplies. &quot;Liverpool&quot; took light damage in the engagement. Ammunition had been rapidly depleted by the cruiser squadron. By the close of the action, &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s crew had almost expended the contents of her shellrooms, reporting that each gun had 40 shells remaining. The Admiralty criticised the squadron&#x27;s expenditure of some 5,000 rounds, which Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, attributed to its inexperience and his insistence on confronting the Italian warships before nightfall. Nevertheless, the use of such a large volume of shells caused the cancellation of MA.3, which had encompassed two convoys from the besieged island of Malta.

The Mediterranean Fleet followed MA.3 with Operation MA.5 in early July. During the course of the deployment, Admiral Cunningham received reports of a large formation of Italian warships and changed course towards Taranto to intercept. On 9 July, the fleets encountered each other off Calabria, in the first major battle between the Allied and Italian navies in the Mediterranean theatre. &quot;Liverpool&quot; and fellow cruiser commenced firing at 15:22, eight minutes after Italian cruisers started their barrage at a range of . After a continuous exchange of fire, the battleship struck the at 16:00, inducing the Italian fleet to disengage from the battle. Italian aircraft attacked &quot;Liverpool&quot; with bombs on 12 July while she was returning to Alexandria, Egypt, causing fatalities and wounding three, including the cruiser&#x27;s commander. Later in July, &quot;Liverpool&quot; escorted convoy AN.2 from Egypt on its way to Greek ports in the Aegean and the southward-convoy AS.2 from the Aegean. The latter convoy came under substantial attack by Italian aircraft on the 29th; &quot;Liverpool&quot; was the only vessel hit when an unexploded bomb penetrated two decks, killing a rating. The casualty was Stoker First Class Patrick Leslie Harney, aged 32, from Stalybridge, Cheshire.

When the Mediterranean Light Forces restructured in August, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was switched to the 3rd Cruiser Squadron, grouped with &quot;Gloucester&quot; and under the command of Rear-Admiral Edward de Faye Renouf. On 28 September, as part of Operation MB.5, &quot;Liverpool&quot; and &quot;Gloucester&quot; proceeded to Malta, transporting reinforcements, airmen, and RAF provisions. The cruisers—briefly protected by a force consisting of the battleships and &quot;Warspite&quot;, aircraft carrier with her aircraft, cruisers , and the Australian , and 11 destroyers—came under repeated aerial attack. Both cruisers later detached from the naval force and reached the island on the 30th.

The fleet again put to sea on 8 October with the intention of supporting Malta convoy MF.3 and the Alexandria-bound convoy MF.4, while seeking to engineer an encounter with the main assets of the Italian Navy. Although Admiral Cunningham did not realise his latter objective, which was limited to an engagement with Italian destroyers, the convoys reached their respective destinations. &quot;Illustrious&quot; then conducted aerial operations against Italian installations on the island of Leros. While &quot;Liverpool&quot; and other escorts were returning from the sortie on 14 October, Italian torpedo-bombers attacked the cruiser, inflicting considerable damage to the forward section and causing fuel to be released from the aviation tank. &quot;Liverpool&quot; was torpedoed by a Savoia-Marchetti &quot;278-6&quot; piloted by Capitano Massimiliano Erasi. According to Captain Read, despite the petrol being surrounded with 70 tons of water in accordance with regulation, the fuel reached the mess decks and became exposed to an electrical short circuit. The subsequent explosion, at 19:20, seriously compromised &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s bow structure, enveloped the forecastle in flames, and blew up the vacated &quot;A&quot; turret.

&quot;Liverpool&quot;″s crew prepared the cruiser&#x27;s Carley floats and other small craft while warships, including ?, began to arrive at the scene. &quot;Orion&quot;, screened by the anti-aircraft cruisers and , took her in tow at the stern. While being towed on 15 October, &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s bow separated from the hull. Later in the day, 12 of the cruiser&#x27;s sailors (including one unidentifiable at the time) were buried at sea. Three more died in the night and were buried before the two cruisers reached the port of Alexandria on 16 October. &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s losses in the attack had amounted to 3 officers and 27 crewmen killed and 35 crewmen wounded. Her captain transferred in late October to the battleship ; his successor being Commander Welby. According to the journal of Midshipman William Hayes, &quot;Liverpool&quot;, like nearby warships, had been forewarned of an imminent attack via radio direction finder (RDF), but the inexperienced rating on watch at his post did not report this to his superiors because of apparent confusion.

As part of the ship&#x27;s interim repairs, &quot;Liverpool&quot; had a provisional false bow constructed and fitted. Once able to embark on a prolonged voyage, &quot;Liverpool&quot; steamed to the United States to have her bow reconstructed at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. The ship&#x27;s presence would not be disclosed until September when the US Navy Department released a list identifying 12 ships situated in various ports. At the shipyard, &quot;Liverpool&quot; had her anti-aircraft armament increased with the addition of nine single 20 mm Oerlikon cannons. She departed in November for Britain, principally to have upgraded radar systems installed.

===Second torpedoing (1942–1945)===
After returning to active service, &quot;Liverpool&quot; became subordinate to the 18th Cruiser Squadron at Scapa Flow and deployed in support of the Arctic convoys. The conditions that Allied ships endured during the convoys proved extreme, with freezing weather, snowstorms, and frequent attacks by the Luftwaffe and Germany Navy. &quot;Liverpool&quot; arrived in the Arctic as a replacement for the damaged cruiser . She joined Convoy QP 10, comprising 16 merchant vessels and five destroyers, on 12 April 1942 as an escort on its journey from the Russian Kola Peninsula to Iceland. The convoy came under repeated attack from U-boats and aircraft for three days. Four vessels were sunk (two of which sank on 11 April) and one was damaged; QP 10 arrived at Reykjavík on the 21st.

In mid-May, &quot;Liverpool&quot; joined a group of warships that was to have escorted &quot;Trinidad&quot; on her return journey to Britain. After temporary repairs in Russia, &quot;Trinidad&quot; got underway on 13 May. The group that included &quot;Liverpool&quot; positioned itself west of Bear Island, in the Barents Sea, to rendezvous with the cruiser. On 14 May, &quot;Trinidad&quot; came under repeated attack and was set ablaze by bombs. The British had to evacuate and sink her the following day when the fire became uncontrollable. &quot;Liverpool&quot; and the rest of Rear-Admiral Burrough&#x27;s group came under attack themselves on the return journey. On 25 May, &quot;Liverpool&quot; began escorting PQ 16, a convoy of 35 merchant vessels bound for Murmansk, the largest convoy yet undertaken in support of the Soviet Union. PQ 16 had considerable protection, including the light and heavy cruisers , &quot;Kent&quot;, and &quot;Norfolk&quot;, and numerous destroyers and submarines, with distant cover provided by the Home Fleet. Inevitably, the convoy came under attack, beginning with a sortie on 25 May that damaged the freighter SS &quot;Carlton&quot;. Sustained attacks from U-boats and at least 242 German aircraft yielded a total of seven vessels sunk on 26–27 May. The cruiser escort switched to the returning convoy QP 12 on 26 May.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; returned to the Mediterranean in June to participate in Operation Harpoon, part of the Malta Convoys. While assigned to Force W covering convoy WS.19 on 14 June, &quot;Liverpool&quot; and the convoy came under attack by at least 38 Axis aircraft. They crippled &quot;Liverpool&quot; and sunk the Dutch freighter &quot;Tanimbar&quot;, ultimately depriving the convoy of a close cruiser escort as and were covering Force W&#x27;s aircraft carriers when Italian ships attacked the surviving merchantmen and destroyers. The torpedo that impacted &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s starboard side hit the engine room, partially flooding the cruiser and disabling her machinery and steering gear. Reduced to a speed of , &quot;Liverpool&quot; had to be taken under tow by the destroyer . For the rest of the day, Italian aircraft focused on &quot;Liverpool&quot; rather than the convoy. Before arriving at Gibraltar on 17 June, the group came under further air attack and &quot;Liverpool&quot; incurred additional damage due to near misses. For &quot;Liverpool&quot;, casualties from the original attack were recorded in the ship&#x27;s log as 15 killed and 22 wounded. The fatalities from the torpedoing had remained in the engine room and been affected by heat exposure, requiring the distribution of an additional tot of rum to the volunteer retrieval party.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; received temporary repairs at Gibraltar and returned to Britain in August. Although repairs at Rosyth were completed by July 1943, sufficient personnel would not be assigned to &quot;Liverpool&quot; until late 1945. At Rosyth, &quot;Liverpool&quot; underwent an extended period of refitting and maintenance. The refit upgraded &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s radar equipment, removed &quot;X&quot; turret and the aircraft catapult, and enlarged the cruiser&#x27;s defensive armament (which included an increase to 16 Bofors 40 mm, in six twin and four single mounts).

===Post-Second World War (1945–1958)===
&quot;Liverpool&quot; returned to service in October 1945 to join the 15th Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet, in which she served mostly as a flagship. In October 1946, &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s visit to Greece was interrupted by the Corfu Channel mining of the destroyers and . With Admiral Algernon Willis embarked, &quot;Liverpool&quot; steamed to Corfu in response, and briefly received the wounded captain of &quot;Saumarez&quot; at Corfu Bay. In April 1948, the cruiser transported Olympic torches and related items in preparation for the ceremonial prelude to the Summer Olympic Games in London.
While docked in the harbour of Alexandria on 22 January 1950, &quot;Liverpool&quot; entertained King Farouk. Given a 21-gun salute by the cruiser, Farouk met Vice-Admiral Louis Mountbatten and the ambassador to Egypt and later expressed his &quot;pleasure at the visit and at renewing my acquaintance with the Royal Navy.&quot; In September 1951, &quot;Liverpool&quot;, as flagship of Admiral John Edelsten, became the first British warship to visit Yugoslavia post-war and was inspected by the country&#x27;s leader Marshal Tito in the city of Split. It had been the Royal Navy&#x27;s first official visit to the country in 12 years.

Following the abrogation of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in October 1951, the Royal Navy dispatched vessels to Port Said after dock workers declared a strike protesting the British administration of the Suez Canal Zone. The cruisers and &quot;Liverpool&quot; consecutively assumed responsibility for dock operations, supplying men to replace unavailable workers and guard against guerrilla attacks on facilities. In January, Egyptian media accused &quot;Liverpool&quot; of firing her guns into the port during an engagement with guerrillas, which the British military vehemently denied and attributed to misidentification.

Upon decommission in 1952, &quot;Liverpool&quot; entered the reserve at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard. &quot;Liverpool&quot; became an accommodation ship at Portsmouth and was used by the &quot;Senior Officer, Reserve Fleet&quot; and his staff. Comprehensive plans were drawn up for the modernisation of HMS Liverpool. The Town class cruisers were assessed as suitable for mounting three of the new twin Mk 26 twin 6 inch guns, while the smaller Fiji and Minotaur class cruisers could accommodate only two. HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; and HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; as the two largest Town-class cruisers were considered priorities for modernisation in the early 1950s and with the &quot;Minotaur&quot;-class cruisers, HMS &quot;Superb&quot; and HMS &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, were the only wartime legacy cruisers for which a full ships cover was drawn, for modernisation with postwar weapons systems. However, the gradual rationalisation of the Royal Navy began in earnest in the 1950s under Duncan Sandys&#x27; 1957 Defence White Paper, and the reserve of at least 551 ships was abolished. With the complete withdrawal from service of wartime cruisers by the 1960s, the roles of &quot;Liverpool&quot; and her contemporaries effectively became superseded by the guided missile destroyers and the three cruisers of the . &quot;Liverpool&quot; was sold in 1958 for breaking up at Bo&#x27;Ness, Scotland; more than 12 months elapsed before the vessel had been completely dismantled.

<doc id="447404" wikidata="Q7647183" url="?curid=447404" title="Survival Research Laboratories">
<text>Survival Research Laboratories (SRL) is an American performance art group which pioneered the genre of large-scale machine performance. Founded in 1978 by Mark Pauline in San Francisco the group is known in particular for performances where custom-built machines, often robotic, compete to destroy each other.
The performances, described by one critic as &quot;noisy, violent and destructive&quot;, are noted for visual and aural cacophony created by the often dangerous interactions of the machinery. SRL&#x27;s work is related to process art and generative art. 

==History==
SRL was started in San Francisco in 1978 by Mark Pauline. Critics drew parallels between the group&#x27;s founding and the punk and industrial music scenes of San Francisco at the time. The group&#x27;s name is a parody of corporate culture. Pauline said that &quot;the vision for SRL was always about creepy, scary, violent and extreme performances that really captured the feeling of machines as living things&quot;.

SRL&#x27;s early collaborators included the machine artists including Matt Heckert and Eric Werner. Heckert&#x27;s work in the group centered on the acoustic and musical parts of performance. He left the group in 1988 to follow his musical interests. After about 30 years in San Francisco, SRL moved to Petaluma, California in 2008.

==Shows==
As of late 2023, SRL has conducted over 120 shows throughout the world, mostly in the western United States. SRL shows are essentially performance art installations acted out by machines rather than people. The interactions between the machines have been characterized as &quot;noisy, violent, and destructive&quot;. A frequent tag-line on SRL literature is &quot;Producing the most dangerous shows on Earth.&quot; A side-effect of the group&#x27;s activities is frequent interactions with governmental and legal authorities.

Their performances are also given colorfully elaborate names as a comment on bureaucratically generated research projects &amp; papers, such as &quot;A Calculated Forecast of Ultimate Doom: Sickening Episodes of Widespread Devastation Accompanied by Sensations of Pleasurable Excitement.&quot; The first SRL show was &quot;Machine Sex&quot; on February 25, 1979. The event featured a device called &quot;The Demanufacturing Machine&quot; which &quot;demanufactured&quot; objects by shredding them and flinging them toward the audience. The 1982 show &quot;A Cruel and Relentless Plot to Pervert the Flesh of beasts to Unholy Uses&quot; integrated machines with objects such as mummified and dissected animals and a robot that was part metallic dog, part cadaver.

In August 11, 1985 8pm, at 330 Santa Fe Ave., Los Angeles SLR performed &quot;Extremely Cruel Practices: A series of events designed to instruct those interested in policies that correct or punish&quot;. &quot;Billed as&quot;: LACE (Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions) and ANTICLUB present: A Machine Performance by Survival Research Laboratories / Mark Pauline and Matt Heckert, assisted by Eric Werner, Neal Pauline, and Monte Cazazza. Performed at an abandoned train depot lot, situated with the Los Angeles concrete river to the east, the 1st street bridge to the north, the 4th street bridge to the south. Attendees were required to sign a waiver before admission. 

The group performed &quot;The Misfortunes of Desire (Acted Out at an Imaginary Location Symbolizing Everything Worth Having)&quot; in 1988 in the parking lot of Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. Using 22 tons of equipment the show included a shock wave cannon, a 4-legged walking machine, a high power flame thrower, a radio-controlled tank and a 1,200-pound catapult. The show was sponsored by the New York City arts groups The New Museum, Creative Time, and The Kitchen.

In 1989 the group presented &quot;Illusions of Shameless Abundance&quot; in San Francisco. The show, staged in the SOMA area under an on-ramp to the Bay Bridge, featured stacks of burning pianos, vats of spoiled food, and flame-breathing robots. The show&#x27;s use of fake sculptures resembling high explosive devices led to beach closures and the involvement of the city&#x27;s bomb squad the next day. The group produced the 1995 show &quot;Crime Wave&quot; in San Francisco.

Their 1996 show in Phoenix titled &quot;Survival Research Laboratories Contemplates a Million Inconsiderate Experiments&quot;, featured robots, flame throwers, and a V-1 jet engine. In 1997 SRL staged &quot;The Unexpected Destruction of Elaborately Engineered Artifacts&quot; in Austin, Texas. In 2006 they performed &quot;Ghostly Scenes of Infernal Desecration&quot; in San Jose, California. The performance featured an air launcher, a hovercraft, and a shockwave cannon. 

== Reception ==
SRL has received serious consideration as not only a pioneer of industrial performance art, but also as a legitimate heir to the traditions of Dada and the art of Jean Tinguely in which paradoxical creations are used to call into question the state and direction of technological society.

In addition, many SRL members were later involved in other avant-garde artistic projects like the Cacophony Society, the Suicide Club, The Haters, Robochrist Industries, People Hater, Seemen, Burning Man, and robotics projects including Battlebots and Robot Wars.

SRL has been praised as being a place where many women have access to working with robotics and advanced machine workshop tools.

:&quot;See also Survival Research Laboratories&#x27; own list of machines&quot;

* &quot;The Demanufacturing Machine&quot; which &quot;demanufactured&quot; objects by shredding them and flinging them toward the audience. This device was featured at SRL&#x27;s first show titled &quot;Machine Sex&quot; on February 25, 1979.
* &quot;Assured Destructive Capability&quot; – a robot that defecated on photographs of Soviet premier at the time.
*&quot;Flame Hurricane&quot; – five Pulsejet engines and louvers arranged in a circle to produce a rapidly rotating column of hot wind, plus flames
* &quot;Hand-O&#x27;-God&quot; - a giant spring-loaded hand, cocked by an air cylinder
* &quot;High Pressure Air Launcher&quot; – originally developed by NASA for use in avalanche control; fires beer cans filled with plaster using a charge. A parody of warfare technologies, with the device&#x27;s operator wearing a head-mounted display.
* &quot;The Pitching Machine&quot; – a device which fires 2x4 pieces of lumber

* &quot;The V1&quot; – a replica of the engine of a World War II V1 flying bomb pulse jet
* &quot;Wheelocopter&quot; – a spinning machine which applies the principles of rotorcraft to a two-dimensional plane

==Accidents and controversies==
In 1982 Pauline lost two fingers from his right hand while attempting to make solid rocket fuel. Due to the 1989 San Francisco show &quot;Illusions of Shameless Abundance&quot; SRL was banned in 2011 from performing in the city by the San Francisco Fire Department.

The sound of 1991 test in San Francisco of a homemade V-1 rocket engine resulted in police attention and a reported 300 calls to the city&#x27;s earthquake hotline. In 2007 SRL crew member Todd Blair suffered a serious brain injury during the take-down of an SRL show at the Robodock Arts &amp; Technology Festival in Amsterdam.

<doc id="447407" wikidata="Q1032053" url="?curid=447407" title="HMS Liverpool (1909)">
<text>HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; was a 4,800 ton light cruiser of the Royal Navy commissioned in 1909. Named for the port city of &quot;Liverpool&quot;, the cruiser served continuously in home waters subordinated to the Home Fleet from 1909 through the initial stages of the First World War.

During the war, &quot;Liverpool&quot; fought in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, operated off the coast of West Africa, and served in the Adriatic and Aegean. On 27 October 1914, the cruiser assisted in the rescue of the crew of &quot;Audacious&quot;. &quot;Liverpool&quot; made efforts to tow the battleship to port, but &quot;Audacious&quot; eventually capsized and exploded. After the Armistice was signed, &quot;Liverpool&quot; operated in the Black Sea during the Russian Civil War until placed in reserve in June 1919.

==History==
===Grand Fleet (1914-1915)===
Built by Vickers Sons &amp; Maxim at Barrow-in-Furness, she was the first &quot;Liverpool&quot; to be named for the port city in the 20th Century and the first to be constructed of steel. Launched on 30 October 1909 and commissioned in 1910, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was one of five cruisers ordered to the &quot;Bristol&quot; sub-class specification. The &quot;Bristol&quot; sub class was the first medium (or 2nd class) cruiser design to be built for the Royal Navy since the late 19th Century. Their main armament consisted of two and ten guns — a mixed configuration deemed &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and discontinued in the subsequent Weymouth sub-class in favour of a uniform complement of eight guns.

She was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron of the Home Fleet on commission and transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron in 1913. At the beginning of the First World War, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was serving with the 5th Light Cruiser Squadron. She participated in the first engagement of the war, the Battle of Heligoland Bight, on 28 August 1914 grouped with five other Town cruisers under command of Commodore William Goodenough. After the German cruiser was heavily damaged and disabled, Goodenough ordered his ships to cease firing on her at 12:55 pm and a rescue operation was subsequently undertaken. &quot;Liverpool&quot;, accompanied by the destroyers and , manoeuvred close to the cruiser in an effort to recover the surviving crew. Small craft from &quot;Liverpool&quot; were deployed to retrieve crewmembers who had abandoned ship while &quot;Lurcher&quot; positioned alongside &quot;Mainz&quot; to transfer the remaining personnel on board. &quot;Liverpool&quot; detached from the main force at 7:45 pm to transport 86 embarked prisoners to Rosyth, including a son of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz.

Two-months later, on 27 October, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was in the company of the battleship when the latter struck a mine during a morning exercise by the Grand Fleet off the coast of Ireland. Unsure of the circumstances of the incident, the Admiralty ordered the fleet to withdraw as a precaution while &quot;Liverpool&quot; remained as an escort. &quot;Audacious&quot; attempted to proceed to Lough Swilly but the flooding proved to be grievous. Other vessels, including the liner , converged on the position after &quot;Audacious&quot; transmitted an SOS. Repeated attempts to tow the immobile &quot;Audacious&quot; were ineffectual and the crew was steadily evacuated. The battleship capsized and exploded at 20:45 with the loss of a petty officer on board &quot;Liverpool&quot;, killed by a scattered piece of armour plate.

===Adriatic and Aegean (1915-1918)===
In 1915, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was detached from the Grand Fleet and sent to patrol the coast of West Africa in support of a search for the armed merchant cruiser . &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s mission was unsuccessful and the cruiser arrived at her namesake port in June for boiler repairs. After the repairs were completed, &quot;Liverpool&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean in November. She was ported in Brindisi, which functioned as a naval base for Allied warships operating in the Adriatic against Austria-Hungary. The cruiser, in concert with the Italian , pursued the Austrian destroyer &quot;Wildfang&quot; in February 1916, necessitating the latter&#x27;s retreat to Cattaro. During the Battle of the Otranto Straits, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was under command of Captain G.H. Vivian and at a reduced state of readiness. Her unpreparedness was compounded by the captain&#x27;s decision to use the cruiser&#x27;s reduced state as an opportunity to undergo routine maintenance of the cruiser&#x27;s boilers. Signals received from Saseno classified as &quot;Urgent&quot; were intercepted at 0350 am and disregarded because &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s wireless room was unable to read Italian and had been the recipient of similar signals previously. Ultimately, &quot;Liverpool&quot; remained in port and no order was issued by Admiral Alfredo Acton for &quot;Liverpool&quot; to sail despite the cruiser&#x27;s eventual readiness and Captain Vivian&#x27;s personal request.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; was transferred to the Aegean Squadron in January 1918. Armistices with the Central Powers were signed later that year. With the Black Sea&#x27;s accessibility restored and the Allies committed to intervention during the Russian Civil War, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was ordered to the region and engaged in operations supporting the White Army from November. On the 23rd, &quot;Liverpool&quot; and the French armoured cruiser , escorted by two Australian destroyers, transported military delegations to the port of Novorossisk to establish contact with Russian General Denikin. She returned to Britain in mid-1919 and was relegated to reserve status in June, berthed at Devonport Dockyard.

Placed on the disposal list in March 1920, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was sold to Stanlee, then acquired by Slough Trading Company in November 1921 and broken up in Germany. A silver bell and plate were preserved and presented to the Birkenhead-built battleship . The objects came into the possession of the sixth in the late 1930s as gifts following the light cruiser&#x27;s commission.

<text>Give Up is the sole studio album by American electronic duo the Postal Service, released on February 18, 2003, by Sub Pop Records. The Postal Service was a collaboration between singer-songwriter Ben Gibbard, best-known for his work with indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, and musician Jimmy Tamborello, who also records under the name Dntel. Gibbard rose to prominence in the early 2000s as frontman of Death Cab, while Tamborello gained a cult following as a pioneer of contemporary glitch music and electronica. The two first collaborated with the song &quot;(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&quot;, for Dntel&#x27;s debut LP, &quot;Life Is Full of Possibilities&quot; (2001).

The album is a long-distance collaboration between Gibbard, who lived in Seattle, Washington, and Tamborello, who resided in Los Angeles, California. The duo named the project for their working method: the pair would send demos on burned CD-R&#x27;s through the mail, adding elements until songs were complete. The LP&#x27;s sound contrasts manipulated samples and keyboards with live guitar and drums—a sound some have described as &quot;indietronica&quot;. Tamborello was responsible for the programming, while Gibbard wrote lyrics, provided vocals, and contributed additional instrumentation. &quot;Give Up&quot; also features guest appearances from vocalists Jen Wood and Jenny Lewis, as well as musician Chris Walla.

&quot;Give Up&quot; was released with little promotion—its creators embarked on a brief tour, but otherwise returned to their main projects. Despite this, the album grew in popularity steadily in the ensuing years, bolstered by the singles &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; and &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes&quot;. By the end of its first decade, it had sold 1.2 million copies in the U.S., making it Sub Pop&#x27;s second-biggest selling album in its history. It also courted a trademark battle with the United States Postal Service and a dispute with Apple. Despite its popularity, &quot;Give Up&quot; stands as the duo&#x27;s only studio album. In 2013, the group briefly reunited for an anniversary tour and reissue of the album. In 2023, the band embarked on a 20th anniversary tour.

==Background==

The Postal Service is a collaboration between singer-songwriter Ben Gibbard and electronic musician Dntel (Jimmy Tamborello). Gibbard rose to prominence in the early 2000s as frontman of the indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, while Tamborello gained a cult following as a pioneer of contemporary glitch music and electronica. In 2001, Tamborello released his first album under the Dntel moniker, titled &quot;Life Is Full of Possibilities&quot;, which features several guest vocalists. The LP featured the duo&#x27;s first collaboration, with the song &quot;(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan&quot;. The pair had met through Tamborello&#x27;s roommate, Pedro Benito, who was in the indie rock group the Jealous Sound, a band that had toured with Death Cab. When Gibbard stayed at their apartment for several days, Tamborello recruited him to contribute to the album.

Gibbard and Tamborello came from distinctly different musical backgrounds, and did not know each other well. Tamborello—then based outside Los Angeles—came up as a member of the electropop band Figurine, with whom he&#x27;d released two albums. Gibbard, meanwhile, had released three albums with his indie rock outfit Death Cab, who were based in Seattle, Washington. The band nearly disbanded after an argument on tour in October 2001; after returning home, the group decided to take a brief hiatus, setting the stage for a side-project. Though the pair did not initially connect on a personal level in a strong sense—with Gibbard more sociable and Tamborello often reserved—they continued to collaborate. Gibbard suggested the two release an extended play (EP) of their work.

Tamborello had contacts at famed Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, best-known for releasing albums by Nirvana and Sleater-Kinney. Tony Kiewel, who had gone to college with Tamborello, had recently began working for Sub Pop in their A&amp;R division. He proposed that they release a full-length album as opposed to an EP, noting that the former received more attention than the latter. &quot;If you&#x27;re going to do it, do a full album,&quot; he told the duo. &quot;People will review it, and you can sell it for three times as much.&quot; The duo signed a joint record deal with Sub Pop, and work on what became &quot;Give Up&quot; began in earnest in December 2001.

==Recording and production==

The production process behind &quot;Give Up&quot; involved Tamborello, based in the L.A. community of Silver Lake, sending Gibbard, living north in Seattle, pieces of instrumental music on burned CD-Rs. Gibbard would pick up the disc from Sub Pop&#x27;s corporate office and return to his home in the Capitol Hill district. He would insert the CD into his portable Discman player and walk around his neighborhood, humming melodies to the music. He also carried a notebook to compile his ideas, which he would use when home to write lyrics. Gibbard would then manipulate the recordings on his laptop, augmenting the beats with additional guitar, keyboards, and live drums. He dubbed his home studio &quot;Computerworld&quot;. Gibbard, who had always found writing music to be more difficult than composing lyrics, found the arrangement particularly appealing. &quot;It was really great to get a little package every month or two – &#x27;Two new songs!&#x27;&quot; he noted in 2002. &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;d say, &#x27;I want to move that part and this part,&#x27; and it was really fun to have such autonomy in the writing; I could pretty much do whatever I wanted.&quot;

Tamborello, operating from his L.A. home studio he called Dying Songs, contributed more-or-less finished bed tracks. The first two songs he sent developed into &quot;Brand New Colony&quot; and &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;, which were completed over the course of a week. The pair worked at a pace of two or three songs per month. As Gibbard did not know Tamborello very well, he was nervous he would not respond to his contributions positively. &quot;I really thought he was gonna be like, &#x27;How dare you do this to my songs?&#x27;&quot; he said. Initially, Tamborello was challenged by Gibbard&#x27;s vocal suggestions. &quot;When you&#x27;re just writing the music, you come up with your own vocal melodies. But Ben&#x27;s ideas were totally different,&quot; he told the BBC. The two were relative strangers from distinctly different musical backgrounds; &quot;It was like having to work on the album and make friends at the same time,&quot; he admitted. Tamborello admitted he expected the album to be more experimental than it turned out to be.

The album has several guest musicians, including Jen Wood, a solo artist formerly of the band Tattle Tale, and Jenny Lewis, then known for her work with Rilo Kiley. Wood had previously toured with Death Cab, and she and Gibbard were longtime friends. He invited her to contribute via e-mail, and the resulting session took only two hours. Wood provides backing vocals on &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; and &quot;Nothing Better&quot;. Next, Gibbard phoned Lewis to gauge her interest, who was at that time recording with Rilo Kiley in Omaha, Nebraska. She excitedly agreed to join the project, and the two met for the first time when she picked Gibbard up from the Burbank airport. She recorded her contributions over a period of several days; on the final LP, over half of the album&#x27;s track listing features her backing vocals, which were recorded in Tamborello&#x27;s bedroom. Additional recording on the LP took place at the Hall of Justice, a studio in Seattle&#x27;s Ballard neighborhood, during the spring of 2002. Chris Walla, a member of Death Cab, had purchased the studio two years prior. Walla recorded the live accompaniment, and guested on piano on &quot;Nothing Better&quot;.

Though the initial press release for the album states that it was completed in ten months, other sources claim it was completed in half that time. Gibbard flew to Los Angeles only twice during the production of the album. The first was to oversee Lewis&#x27;s contribution, and also record additional vocals. The duo came to feel that Gibbard&#x27;s original demo vocals were better, and they discarded much of the new vocal takes. The second trip was to be involved in the mixing process. Both musicians mixed the album in Tamborello&#x27;s bedroom; he noted that it was simply too involved a process to conduct via the mail. Ironically, despite the final name they chose for the project, they did not use the United States Postal Service as a courier; the CDs were sent through either FedEx or UPS. Kiewel remarked in a 2013 interview that &quot;Give Up&quot; was one of the &quot;cheapest records Sub Pop ever made.&quot; Though he withheld the final number, he revealed the project had a very small budget, and that when combined, the five LPs the label distributed that year cost less than $50,000.

==Composition==

&quot;Give Up&quot; is considered a combination of indie rock and electronic music—dubbed by some &quot;indietronica&quot;. MTV&#x27;s Brian Wallace described the sound of the album as a collision between &quot;moody indie rock with the manipulated samples, keyboards and beats of IDM electronica.&quot; Programmed elements are accentuated with acoustic guitars and live drums. Critics compared it to the eighties synthpop and new wave genres. Pitchfork Media&#x27;s Matt LeMay and AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares both commented on the contrasts between the &quot;cool, clean synths&quot; and Gibbard&#x27;s vocal melodies. Nearly every synthesized element on the album uses the Kurzweil K2000RS, a sampler. The device came with bass and synthesizer presets, though Tamborello would significantly alter each preset to make it more original. His computer at the time was a Macintosh Quadra, which was not sufficiently powerful enough to record audio with. Tamborello used it as a sequencer, controlling the K2000RS with MIDI. He would program the drum patterns in the computer. He also used an Apple PowerBook G4, a small laptop computer, to record the album.

Lyrically, the album touches on themes of love, as well as fame, history, and friendship. On both &quot;Give Up&quot; and &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, the Death Cab for Cutie album released the same year, Gibbard lyrically explores distance and &quot;the ability of relationships to survive [separation].&quot; Gibbard noted that &quot;District&quot;, &quot;Brand New Colony&quot;, and &quot;This Place is a Prison&quot; were the only strictly autobiographical songs: &quot;Everything else is just kind of daydreaming and coming up with ideas for songs that aren&#x27;t necessarily based in reality, and I think that was a lot more fun for me to do because I&#x27;d never really done that before,&quot; he said in 2002. Alexia Loundras of the BBC observed that the album offers a melancholy but hopeful sentiment. Portions of &quot;Give Up&quot; were inspired by the break-up of what Gibbard called his &quot;first real adult relationship.&quot; The split occurred because of how much time Gibbard devoted to music. Afterwards, his former partner relocated to Washington, D.C., which inspired &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;.

&quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot; opens with a series of moody, deep-sounding chords designed to emulate the sound of an organ—an edited version of a K2000RS preset called NeoProfit. The first half of the song&#x27;s drum programming was inspired by the Björk album &quot;Homogenic&quot; (1997), while the second half, with its four on the floor pattern, was inspired by the work of Lali Puna and the German record label Morr Music. Gibbard wrote &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; as a love song for a girl he was interested in at the time. He noted that the relationship ended rather quickly, rendering the song&#x27;s meaning rather pointless. The song came together late in the recording process, and was one of the last songs the duo completed in June 2002. Its genesis came together &quot;incredibly quickly,&quot; according to Gibbard, who felt it &quot;seemingly came out of nowhere. It did feel that there was some sort of spiritual transcendence happening and the song being beamed down to me.&quot; For Gibbard, the song was a thematic departure from his more melancholy subject matter: &quot;I think &#x27;Such Great Heights&#x27; is the first time I&#x27;ve ever written a positive love song,&quot; he told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;where it&#x27;s a song about being in love and how it&#x27;s rad, rather than having your heart broken.&quot;

&quot;Sleeping In&quot; alludes to Lee Harvey Oswald, the man responsible for assassinating U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963. &quot;Nothing Better&quot; is a duet with Wood, and functions as a conversation between the two. The track was directly inspired by the Human League&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;. In &quot;Clark Gable&quot;, named after the famed twentieth-century actor, Gibbard sings of making home movies with a former lover. &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes&quot; centers on an impending apocalypse. It was inspired by a survivalist phase Gibbard went through after the September 11 attacks, where he felt convinced the world was soon to end.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Give Up&quot; has been considered a sleeper hit—its reaction was initially muted, but grew steadily via word-of-mouth in the following years. The LP arrived with virtually no promotion; besides the ensuing tour, there was &quot;little mainstream press, and airplay [was] confined to college stations and public radio.&quot; In its first four months of release, it moved between 2,000 and 3,000 units per week. During the week of Christmas in 2003, the LP had its overall best sales, selling 9,000 copies in a week. Through their relationship with the Alternative Distribution Alliance, Sub Pop began to carry the album at larger retailers, such as Tower Records, Virgin Megastore, and Best Buy. Megan Jasper, then the general manager at the label, estimated that Best Buy moved the most product of the three. &quot;Billboard&quot; Michael Paolettta broke down that sixty percent of its sales at that time came from retail chains, thirty percent through independent record shops, and the remaining ten percent from &quot;mass merchants and nontraditional sellers.&quot;

&quot;Such Great Heights&quot; was the album&#x27;s first single, released as a physical, four-track CD single in January 2003. The duo both jokingly referred to it as &quot;the hit&quot; of the album when writing it. The disc charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, a ranking that only measured in-store purchases. Sub Pop offered a free download of the song on their official website, which had been downloaded over nine million times by August 2005; over four million users downloaded the song from the label&#x27;s MySpace page. In January 2004, influential L.A. radio station KROQ-FM began playing &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;, which bolstered the album&#x27;s popularity. An acoustic rendition of the tune by Iron &amp; Wine aided in boosting its profile; both were simultaneously popular, with Iron &amp; Wine&#x27;s version used in the film and soundtrack for &quot;Garden State&quot;, as well as in television advertisements for M&amp;M&#x27;s. The original version was licensed for commercials for Target, Ask.com, UPS, Telstra, and Kaiser Permanente. The song was the original theme song to medical drama &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and appears on its first soundtrack. Within two years of its debut, &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; was certified gold for sales of over 500,000 copies by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, peaked at number 3 on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart.

The LP did not debut on &quot;Billboard&quot; all-genre Top 200 Albums chart until thirteen months after its release, which was credited to its slow-building online buzz and licensing in TV commercials. During its initial release, the album peaked at number 114. It spent 111 weeks altogether on the Independent Albums chart, peaking at number three, and also peaked at number four on its Top Heatseekers chart. &quot;Give Up&quot; spent nineteen non-consecutive weeks at the top of the publication&#x27;s Top Electronic Albums chart; in total, it logged over 90 weeks on the chart. It was number two album for that chart&#x27;s year-end ranking for 2004, with &quot;Billboard&quot; Paoletta characterizing it as &quot;the little album that could.&quot; Sales of the album and singles on the nascent iTunes Music Store were high, with &quot;Give Up&quot; also routinely topping the platform&#x27;s Top Electronic Albums chart.

By this time, the project&#x27;s principal members had moved on to other projects, and their newfound mainstream success came as a surprise. For the music industry, its success was also unexpected; Paoletta viewed it one of &quot;2004&#x27;s biggest surprises.&quot; Kiewel was initially convinced the album could sell between 10–20,000 copies, though Tamborello &quot;scoffed&quot; at the idea. It became Sub Pop&#x27;s second biggest-selling album in their history, second only to Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Bleach&quot;, which was released in 1989. The RIAA certified &quot;Give Up&quot; gold in February 2005; that month, the band released a third and final single from the LP, &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes&quot;, backed with a new song, &quot;Be Still My Heart&quot;. The single charted best in Canada, where as a double A-side single the songs reached number seven on the national charts. Domestically, it was a mild crossover hit, peaking at number 82 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in early 2005. Sub Pop tapped &quot;Napoleon Dynamite&quot; director Jared Hess to helm the song&#x27;s music video. Both clips for &quot;Give Up&quot; attracted rotation on the Fuse network and MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Subterranean&quot;.

Over a decade past its release, the RIAA certified the album platinum in the U.S., indicating over one million copies sold. Chris Payne of &quot;Billboard&quot; considered &quot;a testament to its ongoing popularity and influence.&quot; The tenth anniversary reissue of the album reached a new peak of number 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in April 2013. As of that year, &quot;Give Up&quot; had sold over 1.1 million units in the United States.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Give Up&quot; was generally well received by music critics. It holds a score of 79 out of 100 on review aggregate site Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Will Hermes of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Ben Gibbard radiates claustrophobia, so the shut-in synth-pop of this side project fits him like a leotard&quot;, calling &quot;Give Up&quot; &quot;the near-perfect pop record that&#x27;s eluded his main group.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau praised the album&#x27;s &quot;staying power&quot; and felt that &quot;Gibbard&#x27;s delicate voice matches the subtle electro arrangements far more precisely than it does the folky guitars of his real group&quot;.

Reviewing &quot;Give Up&quot; for AllMusic, Heather Phares opined that while the album does not measure up to either Gibbard or Tamborello&#x27;s main projects, it is nonetheless &quot;far more consistent and enjoyable than might be expected.&quot; Michaelangelo Matos of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;a cuddly little new wave reverie&quot; and wrote that &quot;Tamborello&#x27;s delightful pings and whistles fit Gibbard&#x27;s whimsy perfectly.&quot; Devon Powers of &quot;PopMatters&quot; remarked that &quot;like any worthy match, the coming together gives each aspect assets that they&#x27;d be wont to find otherwise&quot;, concluding that the album &quot;integrates the human and the humanoid to give soundtrack to the disconnected, yet earnest escapades of contemporary emotional life.&quot; In a retrospective piece for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Matt LeMay called the album &quot;a pretty damned strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders&quot;.

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Give Up&quot; at number 104 on its list of the 200 best albums of the 2000s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Give Up&quot; as the decade&#x27;s 86th best album.

==Controversy==

In August 2003, the United States Postal Service (USPS) served the band with a cease and desist letter citing tarnishing and dilution of their trademark. The band initially considered renaming themselves. Gibbard traveled to Los Angeles and met with representatives for the agency to come to a consensus. In the end, the duo inked a licensing agreement with the agency; the deal specified the duo could continue to use the name if it agreed to promote the actual U.S. Postal Service. The album was then sold on the USPS&#x27;s official website, and its music used in advertisements. The two also performed at the annual USPS convention in Washington, D.C. in November 2004. Tamborello, in an interview with Pitchfork, said the affair seemed &quot;depressing&quot; at first, but ended up &quot;kind of fun&quot;. They performed only two songs, and briefly met with the Postmaster General. He noted that &quot;Everyone was sort-of in on the joke.&quot;

In 2006, the duo courted further publicity when they shared their discomfort with an Apple commercial, advertising a partnership with Intel, that shared similarities with the &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; music video. The two both share imagery of &quot;space-suited scientists working in a sterile, futuristic laboratory.&quot; Both the TV spot and music video were helmed by the directorial team of Josh Melnick and Xander Charity, who were approached by Apple to re-create the video. All parties failed to inform Gibbard and Tamborello, or Sub Pop, until one day before it began airing. Gibbard shared a statement on the duo&#x27;s official site, calling it a &quot;shot-for-shot re-creation&quot; and claiming disappointment that it &quot;was executed without our consultation or consent.&quot; Apple later promoted the &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; clip on the main page of the iTunes Music Store, prompting it to become the most-downloaded video on the site for a time, ahead of videos by Eminem, Jessica Simpson and The Black Eyed Peas.

==Touring==
The Postal Service—consisting of Gibbard, Tamborello, and Lewis—promoted the 2003 release of &quot;Give Up&quot; by touring that year. Nick Harmer, bassist of Death Cab for Cutie, joined the trio on the trek, managing the group and the visual accompaniment that was projected behind their performance. Rjyan Claybrook Kidwell, touring under the stage name Cex, was the opening act on the inaugural tour. All five musicians, plus their merchandise manager, toured in one van and slept in one motel room together. Gibbard looked back with humor on touring in such close quarters with people who were largely strangers to him. He acknowledged that with typical bands, touring could sometimes grow tiresome. Instead, he equated the band&#x27;s initial tour to a honeymoon phase, noting that the six were largely having fun and drinking heavily.

Initially, their booking agent had trouble explaining the project to promoters; Gibbard noted that the only selling points were that it featured members of Death Cab and Rilo Kiley. Despite this, The Postal Service sold out half of the venues they first performed at. As the album grew in popularity, some venues had to be switched to larger rooms to accommodate more fans—the final Los Angeles date of the trek switched from a 300-seat room to a 1500-capacity. &quot;You could really see physical proof of the album getting popular as we went across the country,&quot; Tamborello recalled. The Postal Service toured for five weeks in the U.S. throughout April–May 2003, and two overseas in Europe that June. &quot;It was a really fun tour, and then we all went back to our day jobs. Things kind of got crazy after that,&quot; Gibbard recalled.

===Tenth anniversary tour===

In 2013, The Postal Service reunited in celebration of the album&#x27;s tenth anniversary, performing to larger crowds at much bigger venues than a decade prior. Lewis joined the band for all of the dates, which also added Laura Burhenn from the Mynabirds on vocals and keyboards. The tour ran between April and August 2013 worldwide, upgrading from club capacity to arenas, such as New York&#x27;s Barclays Center. The group also performed at several festivals, including Coachella and Sasquatch! stateside, and Primavera Sound in Spain. Tamborello noted in an interview that the original laptop he had employed in the album&#x27;s making had over time failed, and he had to piece together the original stems from various external hard drive backups. The tour ended with an appearance at Lollapalooza in Chicago. Gibbard announced that the Lollapalooza after-show, performed at local club the Metro, would be the last Postal Service performance, formally ending the band&#x27;s career.

The following year, the band released a feature-length documentary concert film titled &quot;Everything Will Change&quot;, filmed during a stop of the tour in Berkeley, California; a remixed live album of the same name was later issued in 2020. In addition, the Creators Project (a partnership between Intel and Vice) produced a 15-minute documentary on the tour and the album, titled &quot;Some Idealistic Future&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Give Up&quot; was released during a period in which independent music first began to garner mainstream interest. It has been considered &quot;one of the touchstones of a new generation of indie music.&quot; It was suggested that its success was a reaction to more heavy or aggressive indie rock, such as the White Stripes or the Strokes. In addition to the younger indie fanbase, the album also connected with older listeners, who appreciated its synth-pop influences. &quot;New York Times&quot; editor Jon Pareles observed in 2013 that the album was influential on groups like Owl City and Passion Pit. &quot;Give Up&quot; represented Sub Pop&#x27;s second biggest-selling album in its history, only behind Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Bleach&quot; (1989). The Postal Service eclipsed the Shins and Hot Hot Heat as the record label&#x27;s most popular act in the early aughts. Gibbard has remarked that between &quot;Give Up&quot; and Death Cab&#x27;s &quot;Transatlanticism&quot;, &quot;I’ve never had a more creatively inspired year.&quot;

Though the album was by all accounts immensely successful, &quot;Give Up&quot; still stands as the Postal Service&#x27;s only album. From its genesis, its creators intended it as a one-off experiment. Still, Gibbard and Tamborello continued to collaborate in the intervening years, this time sending their music to one another using the Internet. The duo completed two original songs in 2006—&quot;Turn Around&quot; and &quot;A Tattered Line of String&quot;—before determining the project should remain in the past. Both tracks, and the bulk of the rest of the band&#x27;s recorded output, feature on a bonus disc of the tenth anniversary reissue of the album. As for the future of another album, both musicians have considered it unlikely. Gibbard said that the moment captured something special: &quot;It was just this moment that was very inspired and unique.&quot; Tamborello concurred: &quot;[&quot;Give Up&quot;] came together in such a natural way that I feel like if it happens again, it has to feel like that, and maybe that&#x27;s impossible.&quot;

<doc id="447426" wikidata="Q3377525" url="?curid=447426" title="HMS Liverpool (D92)">
<text>HMS &quot;Liverpool&quot; was a Type 42 destroyer of the Royal Navy. She was built by Cammell Laird in Birkenhead and launched on 25 September 1980 by Lady Strathcona, wife of Euan Howard, the then Minister of State for Defence. &quot;Liverpool&quot; was the last Type 42 Batch 2 in service.

==Operational history==
===1982–1990===
&quot;Liverpool&quot; was commissioned into the Royal Navy in April 1982 and after an accelerated trials period, prepared to sail for the South Atlantic in early June 1982. However, the Falklands War was won before she sailed and she became a trial ship for the many enhancements developed through combat experience. &quot;Liverpool&quot; therefore did not see active service in the Falklands conflict, but she remained on station for the next six months before returning to the UK in Spring 1983. In 1987 &quot;Liverpool&quot; was off the north coast of Russia monitoring and data collecting Soviet naval missile and weapons firings. 1988 saw &quot;Liverpool&quot; undertake a DED in Rosyth, when she was fitted with the Phalanx weapons system. 1989 saw her deploy to the Persian Gulf for Operation Armilla, as she did again 1990 and 1993. There then followed a period with the NATO standing force in the Mediterranean.
===1991–2000===

After the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano in 1995, the destroyer played a vital role in the evacuation of Montserrations to nearby islands as part of an effort which saw 7,000 people leave the island for places such as Antigua and Barbuda (a distance, which was impossible by aircraft at the time due to the destruction of the Blackburne international airport). In 1997 and 1998 she was commanded by Captain David Snelson and then by Captain Philip Wilcocks until 1999.

===2001–2010===
&quot;Liverpool&quot; fired what is believed to be the first salvo of Sea Dart missiles in well over a decade. The firing took place approximately south-west of the Isles of Scilly on 8 September 2002, against a sea skimming target to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sea Dart missile and &quot;Liverpool&quot;″s systems following a 12-month refit at Rosyth Dockyard.

She was part of Naval Task Group 03 (NTG03), intended to take part in exercises in the far east as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangement. The task force was, instead, sent to the Persian Gulf where it took part in the 2003 Iraq War.

In 2005, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was sent to the Caribbean, where her duties included patrols to crack down on drug smuggling. In 2008, 18 sailors onboard tested positive for cocaine in a routine drug test.

She entered refit in 2009. On returning to service in 2010, &quot;Liverpool&quot; acted as an escort to fleet flagship &#x27;s task group during a four-month deployment to the United States and Canada as part of Exercise Auriga.

===2011–2012===

In late March 2011, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was ordered to the Mediterranean to relieve Type 22 frigate as the Royal Navy&#x27;s contribution to Operation Unified Protector, NATO&#x27;s naval blockade of Libya during the country&#x27;s civil war.

On 18 April, she intercepted the vessel heading for Tripoli, conducting a boarding party search with her own boarding party and finding trucks of potential use to the Gaddafi regime. The merchant vessel was ordered to divert to Salerno in Italy.

On 12 May 2011, while engaged in surveillance operations off the coast of the rebel-held Libyan city of Misrata, &quot;Liverpool&quot; came under fire from a shore battery, making her the first Royal Navy warship to be deliberately targeted since the Falklands War. &quot;Liverpool&quot; had been tasked with other NATO warships, to intercept small, high-speed inflatable craft spotted approaching the port of Misrata, the type which had been used previously to lay mines in the Port of Misrata. Libyan rocket artillery on the coast fired an inaccurate salvo of rockets at &quot;Liverpool&quot;. &quot;Liverpool&quot; returned fire with her 4.5 inch main gun, silencing the shore battery, in the Royal Navy&#x27;s first use of the weapon since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

On 28 June 2011, &quot;Liverpool&quot; used her main gun to fire warning shots at pro-Gaddafi maritime forces moving along Libya&#x27;s Mediterranean coast just west of the city of Misrata, amid concerns a threat was posed to civilians due to recent repeated attempts to mine the harbour. After initially ignoring the first shell, a further three were fired and the vessels were forced to return to their port of departure.

On the morning of 3 August 2011, several rockets were fired at &quot;Liverpool&quot;. She returned fire with her 4.5 inch main gun. The attack came after the ship had fired a barrage of illumination rounds in support of an air attack on the stronghold of Zliten.

On 16 August 2011, &quot;Liverpool&quot; was involved in the most intense shore-bombardment of the war. &quot;Liverpool&quot; had been tasked by a patrol aircraft to fire illumination rounds over the city of Zlitan. While conducting this mission, &quot;Liverpool&quot; came under fire from a Loyalist shore battery. &quot;Liverpool&quot; responded by firing three rounds from her 4.5 inch gun, silencing the battery. Later on the same day, a patrol aircraft spotted a large pro-Gaddafi vehicle convoy carrying weapons and ammunition. &quot;Liverpool&quot; fired 54 shells from her 4.5 inch gun at the convoy, destroying or severely damaging many of the vehicles. During the ensuing chaos on the ground, NATO aircraft destroyed the remainder of the convoy.

&quot;Liverpool&quot; returned from Operation Unified Protector on 7 November 2011, entering Portsmouth Harbour after more than seven months of operations off Libya. She had fired over 200 rounds from her main gun during the conflict.

On 7 February 2012 &quot;Liverpool&quot; escorted a Russian task group centred on the aircraft carrier from the Channel, off south-west England, to the seas off south-west Ireland. The task group of two warships and five support ships were making their way home to the Northern and Baltic Fleets of the Russian Navy.

In March 2012 &quot;Liverpool&quot; took part in Exercise Cold Response, a NATO winter war games exercise being conducted in northern Norway, where she acted as an escort to the helicopter carrier and the amphibious assault ship .

The ship made her final visit to the city of Liverpool on 29 February 2012 where on Saturday 3 March and Sunday 4 March 2012, the general public were invited on deck to look around the ship.

She was formally decommissioned on 30 March 2012.

<doc id="447433" wikidata="Q129902" url="?curid=447433" title="Capitol Reef National Park">
<text>Capitol Reef National Park is a national park of the United States in south-central Utah. The park is approximately long on its northsouth axis and just wide on average. The park was established in 1971 to preserve of desert landscape and is open all year, with May through September being the highest visitation months.

Partially in Wayne County, Utah, the area was originally named &quot;Wayne Wonderland&quot; in the 1920s by local boosters Ephraim P. Pectol and Joseph S. Hickman. Capitol Reef National Park was designated a national monument on August 2, 1937, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to protect the area&#x27;s colorful canyons, ridges, buttes, and monoliths; however, it was not until 1950 that the area officially opened to the public. Road access was improved in 1962 with the construction of State Route 24 through the Fremont River Canyon.

The majority of the nearly long up-thrust formation called the Waterpocket Folda rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powellis preserved within the park. Capitol Reef is an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River. The park was named for its whitish Navajo Sandstone cliffs with dome formationssimilar to the white domes often placed on capitol buildingsthat run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. Locally, &quot;reef&quot; refers to any rocky barrier to land travel, just as ocean reefs are barriers to sea travel.

==Geography==
Capitol Reef encompasses the Waterpocket Fold, a warp in the Earth&#x27;s crust that is 65 million years old. It is the largest exposed monocline in North America. In this fold, newer and older layers of earth folded over each other in an S-shape. This warp, probably caused by the same colliding continental plates that created the Rocky Mountains, has weathered and eroded over millennia to expose layers of rock and fossils. The park is filled with brilliantly colored sandstone cliffs, gleaming white domes, and contrasting layers of stone and earth.

The area was named for a line of white domes and cliffs of Navajo Sandstone, each of which looks somewhat like the United States Capitol building, that run from the Fremont River to Pleasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold.

The fold forms a north-to-south barrier that has barely been breached by roads. Early settlers referred to parallel impassable ridges as &quot;reefs&quot;, from which the park gets the second half of its name. The first paved road was constructed through the area in 1962. State Route 24 cuts through the park traveling east and west between Canyonlands National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park, but few other paved roads invade the rugged landscape.

The park is filled with canyons, cliffs, towers, domes, and arches. The Fremont River has cut canyons through parts of the Waterpocket Fold, but most of the park is arid desert.

==History==
===Native Americans and Mormons===
Fremont-culture Native Americans lived near the perennial Fremont River in the northern part of the Capitol Reef Waterpocket Fold around the year 1000. They irrigated crops of maize and squash and stored their grain in stone granaries (in part made from the numerous black basalt boulders that litter the area). In the 13th century, all of the Native American cultures in this area underwent sudden change, likely due to a long drought. The Fremont settlements and fields were abandoned.

Many years after the Fremont left, Paiutes moved into the area. These Numic-speaking people named the Fremont granaries &quot;moki huts&quot; and thought they were the homes of a race of tiny people or &quot;moki&quot;.

In 1872 Almon H. Thompson, a geographer attached to United States Army Major John Wesley Powell&#x27;s expedition, crossed the Waterpocket Fold while exploring the area. Geologist Clarence Dutton later spent several summers studying the area&#x27;s geology. None of these expeditions explored the Waterpocket Fold to any great extent.

Following the American Civil War, officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City sought to establish missions in the remotest niches of the Intermountain West. In 1866, a quasi-military expedition of Mormons in pursuit of natives penetrated the high valleys to the west. In the 1870s, settlers moved into these valleys, eventually establishing Loa, Fremont, Lyman, Bicknell, and Torrey.

Mormons settled the Fremont River valley in the 1880s and established Junction (later renamed Fruita), Caineville, and Aldridge. Fruita prospered, Caineville barely survived, and Aldridge died. In addition to farming, lime was extracted from local limestone, and uranium was extracted early in the 20th century. In 1904 the first claim to a uranium mine in the area was staked. The resulting Oyler Mine in Grand Wash produced uranium ore.

By 1920 no more than ten families at one time were sustained by the fertile flood plain of the Fremont River and the land changed ownership over the years. The area remained isolated. The community was later abandoned and later still some buildings were restored by the National Park Service. Kilns once used to produce lime are still in Sulphur Creek and near the campgrounds on Scenic Drive.

===Early protection efforts===
Local Ephraim Portman Pectol organized a &quot;booster club&quot; in Torrey in 1921. Pectol pressed a promotional campaign, furnishing stories to be sent to periodicals and newspapers. In his efforts, he was increasingly aided by his brother-in-law, Joseph S. Hickman, who was the Wayne County High School principal. In 1924, Hickman extended community involvement in the promotional effort by organizing a Wayne County-wide Wayne Wonderland Club. That same year, Hickman was elected to the Utah State Legislature.

In 1933, Pectol was elected to the presidency of the Associated Civics Club of Southern Utah, successor to the Wayne Wonderland Club. The club raised U.S. $150 () to interest a Salt Lake City photographer in taking a series of promotional photographs. For several years, the photographer, J. E. Broaddus, traveled and lectured on &quot;Wayne Wonderland&quot;.

In 1933, Pectol was elected to the legislature and almost immediately contacted President Franklin D. Roosevelt and asked for the creation of &quot;Wayne Wonderland National Monument&quot; out of the federal lands comprising the bulk of the Capitol Reef area. Federal agencies began a feasibility study and boundary assessment. Meanwhile, Pectol guided the government investigators on numerous trips and escorted an increasing number of visitors. The lectures of Broaddus were having an effect.
Roosevelt signed a proclamation creating Capitol Reef National Monument on August 2, 1937. In Proclamation 2246, President Roosevelt set aside of the Capitol Reef area. This comprised an area extending about north of present State Route 24 and about south, just past Capitol Gorge. The Great Depression years were lean ones for the National Park Service (NPS), the new administering agency. Funds for the administration of Capitol Reef were nonexistent; it was a long time before the first rangers arrived.

===Administration of the monument===
Administration of the new monument was placed under the control of Zion National Park. A stone ranger cabin and the Sulphur Creek bridge were built and some road work was performed by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Progress Administration. Historian and printer Charles Kelly came to know NPS officials at Zion well and volunteered to watchdog the park for the NPS. Kelly was officially appointed custodian-without-pay in 1943. He worked as a volunteer until 1950, when the NPS offered him a civil-service appointment as the first superintendent.

During the 1950s Kelly was deeply troubled by NPS management acceding to demands of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission that Capitol Reef National Monument be opened to uranium prospecting. He felt that the decision had been a mistake and destructive of the long-term national interest. It turned out that there was not enough ore in the monument to be worth mining.

In 1958 Kelly got additional permanent help in protecting the monument and enforcing regulations; Park Ranger Grant Clark transferred from Zion. The year Clark arrived, fifty-six thousand visitors came to the park, and Charlie Kelly retired for the last time.

During the 1960s (under the program name Mission 66), NPS areas nationwide received new facilities to meet the demand of mushrooming park visitation. At Capitol Reef, a 53-site campground at Fruita, staff rental housing, and a new visitor center were built, the latter opening in 1966.

Visitation climbed dramatically after the paved, all-weather State Route 24 was built in 1962 through the Fremont River canyon near Fruita. State Route 24 replaced the narrow Capitol Gorge wagon road about to the south that frequently washed out. The old road has since been open only to foot traffic. In 1967, 146,598 persons visited the park. The staff was also growing.

During the 1960s, the NPS purchased private land parcels at Fruita and Pleasant Creek. Almost all private property passed into public ownership on a &quot;willing buyer-willing seller&quot; basis.

Preservationists convinced President Lyndon B. Johnson to set aside an enormous area of public lands in 1968, just before he left office. In Presidential Proclamation 3888 an additional were placed under NPS control. By 1970, Capitol Reef National Monument comprised and sprawled southeast from Thousand Lake Mountain almost to the Colorado River. The action was controversial locally, and NPS staffing at the monument was inadequate to properly manage the additional land.

===National park status===

The vast enlargement of the monument and diversification of the scenic resources soon raised another issue: whether Capitol Reef should be a national park, rather than a monument. Two bills were introduced into the United States Congress.

A House bill (H.R. 17152) introduced by Utah Congressman Laurence J. Burton called for a national park and an adjunct national recreation area where multiple use (including grazing) could continue indefinitely. In the United States Senate, meanwhile, Senate bill S. 531 had already passed on July 1, 1970, and provided for a national park alone. The bill called for a 25-year phase-out of grazing.

In September 1970, United States Department of Interior officials told a house subcommittee session that they preferred about be set aside as a national park. They also recommended that the grazing phase-out period be 10 years, rather than 25. They did not favor the adjunct recreation area.

It was not until late 1971 that Congressional action was completed. By then, the 92nd United States Congress was in session and S. 531 had languished. A new bill, S. 29, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Frank E. Moss of Utah and was essentially the same as the defunct S. 531 except that it called for an additional of public lands for a Capitol Reef National Park. In the House, Utah Representative K. Gunn McKay (with Representative Lloyd) had introduced H.R. 9053 to replace the dead H.R. 17152. This time, the House bill dropped the concept of an adjunct Capitol Reef National Recreation Area and adopted the Senate concept of a 25-year limit on continued grazing. The Department of Interior was still recommending a national park of and a 10-year limit for grazing phase-out.

S. 29 passed the Senate in June and was sent to the House, which dropped its own bill and passed the Senate version with an amendment. Because the Senate was not in agreement with the House amendment, differences were worked out in Conference Committee. The Conference Committee issued its report on November 30, 1971, and the bill passed both houses of Congress. The legislation—&#x27;An Act to Establish The Capitol Reef National Park in the State of Utah&#x27;—became Public Law 92-207 when it was signed by President Richard Nixon on December 18, 1971.
== Dark Sky Park ==
 In April 2015, Capitol Reef National Park was designated a &quot;Gold Tier&quot; Dark Sky Park due to its remote location and minimal use of artificial lighting.
==Climate==
According to the Köppen climate classification system, the Capitol Reef Visitor Center has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;).

==Geology==
The area including the park was once the edge of a shallow sea that invaded the land in the Permian, creating the Cutler Formation. Only the sandstone of the youngest member of the Cutler Formation, the White Rim, is exposed in the park. The deepening sea left carbonate deposits, forming the limestone of the Kaibab Limestone, the same formation that rims the Grand Canyon to the southwest.

During the Triassic, streams deposited reddish-brown silt that later became the siltstone of the Moenkopi Formation. Uplift and erosion followed. Conglomerate, followed by logs, sand, mud, and wind-transported volcanic ash, then formed the uranium-containing Chinle Formation.

The members of the Glen Canyon Group were all laid down in the middle- to late-Triassic during a time of increasing aridity. They include:
* Wingate Sandstone: sand dunes on the shore of an ancient sea
* Kayenta Formation: thin-bedded layers of sand deposited by slow-moving streams in channels and across low plains
* Navajo Sandstone: huge fossilized sand dunes from a massive Sahara-like desert.
The San Rafael Group consists of four Jurassic-period formations, from oldest to youngest:
* Carmel Formation: gypsum, sand, and limey silt laid down in what may have been a graben that was periodically flooded by sea water
* Entrada Sandstone: sandstone from barrier islands/sand bars in a near-shore environment
* Curtis Formation: made from conglomerate, sandstone, and shale
* Summerville Formation: reddish-brown mud and white sand deposited in tidal flats.

Streams once again laid down mud and sand in their channels, on lakebeds, and in swampy plains, creating the Morrison Formation. Early in the Cretaceous, similar nonmarine sediments were laid down and became the Dakota Sandstone. Eventually, the Cretaceous Seaway covered the Dakota, depositing the Mancos Shale.

Only small remnants of the Mesaverde Group are found, capping a few mesas in the park&#x27;s eastern section.

Near the end of the Cretaceous period, a mountain-building event called the Laramide orogeny started to compact and uplift the region, forming the Rocky Mountains and creating monoclines such as the Waterpocket Fold in the park. Ten to fifteen million years ago, the entire region was uplifted much further by the creation of the Colorado Plateau. This uplift was very even. Igneous activity in the form of volcanism and dike and sill intrusion also occurred during this time.

The drainage system in the area was rearranged and steepened, causing streams to downcut faster and sometimes change course. Wetter times during the ice ages of the Pleistocene increased the rate of erosion.

== Flora ==
There are more than 840 species of plants that are found in the park and over 40 of those species are classified as rare and endemic.

==Visiting the park==
The closest town to Capitol Reef is Torrey, about west of the visitor center on Highway 24, slightly west of its intersection with Highway 12. Its 2020 population was less than 300. Torrey has a few motels and restaurants and functions as a gateway town to the park. Highway 12 and a partially unpaved scenic backway named the Burr Trail provide access from the west through the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument and the town of Boulder.

== Activities ==
A variety of activities are available to tourists, both ranger-led and self-guided, including auto touring, hiking, backpacking, camping, bicycling (on paved and unpaved roads only; no trails), horseback riding, canyoneering, and rock climbing. The orchards planted by Mormon pioneers are maintained by the National Park Service. From early March to mid-October, various fruit—cherries, apricots, peaches, pears, or apples—can be harvested by visitors for a fee.

=== Hiking and backpacking ===
A hiking trail guide is available at the visitor center for both day hikes and backcountry hiking. Backcountry access requires a free permit.

Numerous trails are available for hiking and backpacking in the park, with fifteen in the Fruita District alone. The following trails are some of the most popular in the park:
* Cassidy Arch Trail: a very steep, strenuous round trip that leads into the Grand Wash to an overlook of the Cassidy Arch.
* Hickman Bridge Trail: a round trip leading to the natural bridge.
* Frying Pan Trail: an round trip that passes the Cassidy Arch, Grand Wash, and Cohab Canyon.
* Brimhall Natural Bridge: a popular, though strenuous, round trip with views of Brimhall Canyon, the Waterpocket Fold, and Brimhall Natural Bridge.
* Halls Creek Narrows: long and considered strenuous, with many side canyons and creeks; typically hiked as a 2-3 day camping trip.

=== Auto touring ===
Visitors may explore several of the main areas of the park by private vehicle:
* Scenic Drive: winds through the middle of the park, passing the major points of interest; the road is accessible from the visitor center to approximately into the Capitol Gorge.
* Notom-Bullfrog Road: traverses the eastern side of the Waterpocket Fold, along of paved road, with the remainder unpaved.
* Cathedral Road: an unpaved road through the northern areas of the park, that traverses Cathedral Valley, passing the Temples of the Sun and Moon.

=== Camping ===
The primary camping location is the Fruita campground, with 71 campsites (no water, electrical, or sewer hookups), and restrooms without bathing facilities. The campground also has group sites with picnic areas and restrooms. Two primitive free camping areas are also available.

=== Canyoneering ===

Canyoneering is growing in popularity in the park. It is a recreational sport that takes one through slot canyons. It involves rappelling and may require swimming and other technical rope work. Day-pass permits are required for canyoneering in the park and can be obtained for free from the visitor&#x27;s center or through email. It&#x27;s key to know that each route requires its own permit. If one is planning on canyoneering for multiple days, passes are required for each day. Overnight camping as part of the canyoneering trip is permitted, but a free backcountry pass must be requested from the visitor center.

It is imperative to plan canyoneering trips around the weather. The Colorado Plateau is susceptible to flash flooding during prime rainy months. Because canyoneering takes place through slot canyons, getting caught in a flash flood could be lethal. Visitors are advised to consult reliable weather sources. The Weather Atlas shows charts with the monthly average rainfall in inches.

Extreme heat during the summer months presents a danger to visitors, who can find weather warnings on the National Weather Service website. The heat levels are detailed by a color and numerical scale (0–4).

One of the most popular canyoneering routes in Capitol Reef National Park is Cassidy Arch Canyon. A paper by George Huddart, details the park&#x27;s commitment to working with citizens to maintain the route as well as the vegetation and rocks. The canyon route is approximately 2.3 miles long (0.4 miles of technical work), consisting of 8 different rappels, and takes between 2.5 and 4.5 hours to complete. The first rappel is 140 ft and descends below the famous Cassidy Arch.

<text>Tax avoidance is the legal usage of the tax regime in a single territory to one&#x27;s own advantage to reduce the amount of tax that is payable by means that are within the law. A tax shelter is one type of tax avoidance, and tax havens are jurisdictions that facilitate reduced taxes. Tax avoidance should not be confused with tax evasion, which is illegal. Both tax evasion and tax avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance, as they describe a range of activities that intend to subvert a state&#x27;s tax system. 

Forms of tax avoidance that use legal tax laws in ways not necessarily intended by the government are often criticized in the court of public opinion and by journalists. Many businesses pay little or no tax, and some experience a backlash when their tax avoidance becomes known to the public. Conversely, benefiting from tax laws in ways that were intended by governments is sometimes referred to as tax planning. The World Bank&#x27;s World Development Report 2019 on the future of work supports increased government efforts to curb tax avoidance as part of a new social contract focused on human capital investments and expanded social protection.

&quot;Tax mitigation&quot;, &quot;tax aggressive&quot;, &quot;aggressive tax avoidance&quot; or &quot;tax neutral&quot; schemes generally refer to multiterritory schemes that fall into the grey area between common and well-accepted tax avoidance, such as purchasing municipal bonds in the United States, and tax evasion but are widely viewed as unethical, especially if they are involved in profit-shifting from high-tax to low-tax territories and territories recognised as tax havens. Since 1995, trillions of dollars have been transferred from OECD and developing countries into tax havens using these schemes.

Laws known as a General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) statutes, which prohibit &quot;aggressive&quot; tax avoidance, have been passed in several countries and regions including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Norway, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. In addition, judicial doctrines have accomplished the similar purpose, notably in the United States through the &quot;business purpose&quot; and &quot;economic substance&quot; doctrines established in &quot;Gregory v. Helvering&quot; and in the United Kingdom in &quot;Ramsay&quot;. The specifics may vary according to jurisdiction, but such rules invalidate tax avoidance that is technically legal but is not for a business purpose or is in violation of the spirit of the tax code.

The term &quot;avoidance&quot; has also been used in the tax regulations[&quot;examples and source needed&quot;] of some jurisdictions to distinguish tax avoidance foreseen by the legislators from tax avoidance exploiting loopholes in the law such as like-kind exchanges.[&quot;correct example needed&quot;] The US Supreme Court has stated, &quot;The legal right of an individual to decrease the amount of what would otherwise be his taxes or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted&quot;.

Tax evasion, on the other hand, is the general term for efforts by individuals, corporations, trusts and other entities to evade taxes by illegal means. Both tax evasion and some forms of tax avoidance can be viewed as forms of tax noncompliance, as they describe a range of activities that are unfavourable to a state&#x27;s tax system.

According to Joseph Stiglitz (1986), there are three principles of tax avoidance: postponement of taxes, tax arbitrage across individuals facing different tax brackets, and tax arbitrage across income streams facing different tax treatment. Many tax avoidance devices include a combination of the three principles.

The postponement of taxes is the present discounted value of postponed tax is much less than of a tax currently paid. Tax arbitrage across individuals facing different tax brackets or the same individual facing different marginal tax rates at different times is an effective method of reducing tax liabilities within a family. However, according to Stiglitz (1986), differential tax rates may also lead to transactions among individuals in different brackets leading to “tax induced transactions”. The last principle is the tax arbitrage across income streams facing different tax treatment.

==Anti-avoidance measures==

An anti-avoidance measure is a rule that prevents the reduction of tax by legal arrangements, where those arrangements are put in place purely to reduce tax, and would not otherwise be regarded as a reasonable course of action.

=== Legislative measures ===

Two kind of anti-avoidance measures exist; General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR) and Specific Anti Avoidance Rules (SAAR). The GAAR implies a set of generic anti-avoidance rules, while SAAR targets a specific avoidance practice or technique. Also, there is a set of bilateral measures pursued thorough treaties or double taxation agreements (DTAAs), this can be done via various clauses.

=== Judicial anti-avoidance measures ===

Courts around the world have played an important role in developing SAAR and GAAR measures. But the two guiding principles in judicial anti-avoidance are business purpose rule and substance over form rule. The business purpose rule states that the transaction must serve as a business purpose. Which means that mere tax advantage cannot be the main business purpose. On the other hand, the substance over form principle is wider than the business rule and it is defined by the OECD as the ‘prevalence of economic or social reality over the literal wording of legal provisions’ (Ostwal, T.P.; Vijayaraghavan, Vikram 2010).

=== EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Package ===

The Anti-Tax Avoidance Package is part of the European Commission&#x27;s agenda as an effort to implement a more effective corporate taxation in the European Union. This package was implemented in 2016 and offers measures to prevent aggressive tax planning and encourage of tax transparency among others. The Anti- Tax Avoidance Package counts with an Anti-Tax avoidance directive, recommendation on Tax Treaties, revised administrative cooperation directive and communication on external strategy.

Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD): On 20 June 2016 the European Council adopted the Directive (EU) 2016/1164 which contains five legally binding anti-abuse measures that should be applied as common forms of aggressive tax legislations. The member States must have applied these measures as from 1 January 2019. ATAD contains the following five anti-abuse measures: 1. Interest deductibility, to discourage artificial debt arrangements which are design to minimise taxes, 2. Exit taxation, for preventing the avoidance of taxes when companies are re-locating assets, 3. Incorporation of the GAAR for disregarding of non-genuine arrangements, 4. Controlled Foreign Company Rule (CFC), to deter that the profit is transferred to a low or no tax country, 5. Switchover rule, to prevent double non-taxation.

=== Anti-avoidance measures by country ===

==== Australia ====

Australia has a strong tax regime regarding avoidance which applies to large corporate groups, underpinned by the General Anti- Avoidance Rule (GAAR) adopted since 1981 with the Income Tax Act. The multinational anti-avoidance law (MAAL) is an extension of Australia&#x27;s general anti-avoidance rules. This aims to make multinational enterprises pay their fair share of tax of the profits received and earned in Australia

==== United States ====

Since 1980s there have been six major tax reforms in the US. The first one, in 1981, introduced a variety of tax loopholes. With this, the tax shelter industry boomed, giving rise to a demand for tax reform. The 1986 tax reform was the most accurate attempt at reducing tax avoidance, but then the next reforms of 1993 and 1997 opened new opportunities for tax avoidance and increased incentives of tax avoidance. The 1986 tax law reduced the demand for tax shelters and the opportunities for tax avoidance by constricting the gap between regular rates and the minimum tax rates. Lowering the top marginal rates, restricting the ability to use losses on just one type of income for balancing gains on other income and finally by taxing capital gains with full rates. There was another tax act in 1993, in which the alternative minimum tax rates were increased, also the regular rates, and an increase in the absolute gap for upper-income people. In the 1997 act, a gap between the rates at which capital gains and ordinary income was introduced to all taxpayers. During the 2001 and 2003 tax acts introduced more opportunities for tax avoidance because the gap between the capital gains and ordinary income tax remained the same as both rates were reduced by 5%. Finally, in the 2013 tax act, increased the tax on capital gains and ordinary income to 20 and 39.6% respectively.

==Methods==

===Country of residence===

A company may choose to avoid taxes by establishing their company or subsidiaries in an offshore jurisdiction (see offshore company and offshore trust). Individuals may also avoid tax by moving their tax residence to a tax haven, such as Monaco, or by becoming perpetual travelers. They may also reduce their tax by moving to a country with lower tax rates.

However, a small number of countries tax their citizens on their worldwide income regardless of where they reside. , only the United States and Eritrea have such a practice, whilst Finland, France, Hungary, Italy and Spain apply it in limited circumstances. In cases such as the US, taxation cannot be avoided by simply transferring assets or moving abroad.

The United States is unlike almost all other countries in that its citizens and permanent residents are subject to U.S. federal income tax on their worldwide income even if they reside temporarily or permanently outside the United States. U.S. citizens therefore cannot avoid U.S. taxes simply by emigrating from the U.S. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine some citizens choose to give up their United States citizenship rather than be subject to the U.S. tax system; but U.S. citizens who reside (or spend long periods of time) outside the U.S. may be able to exclude some salaried income earned overseas (but not other types of income unless specified in a bilateral tax treaty) from income in computing the U.S. federal income tax. The 2015 limit on the amount that can be excluded is US$100,800. In addition, taxpayers can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts. They may also be entitled to exclude from income the value of meals and lodging provided by their employer. Some American parents do not register their children&#x27;s birth abroad with American authorities, because they do not want their children to be required to report all earnings to the IRS and pay American taxes for their entire lives, even if they never visit the United States.

===Double taxation===
Most countries impose taxes on income earned or gains realized within that country regardless of the country of residence of the person or firm. Most countries have entered into bilateral double taxation treaties with many other countries to avoid taxing nonresidents twice—once where the income is earned and again in the country of residence (and perhaps, for U.S. citizens, taxed yet again in the country of citizenship)—however, there are relatively few double-taxation treaties with countries regarded as tax havens. To avoid tax, it is usually not enough to simply move one&#x27;s assets to a tax haven. One must also personally move to a tax haven (and, for U.S. citizens, renounce one&#x27;s citizenship) to avoid tax.

===Legal entities===

Without changing country of residence (or, if a U.S. citizen, without giving up one&#x27;s citizenship), personal taxation may be legally avoided by the creation of a separate legal entity to which one&#x27;s property is donated. The separate legal entity is often a company, trust, or foundation. These may also be located offshore, such as in the case of many private foundations. Assets are transferred to the new company or trust so that gains may be realized, or income earned, within this legal entity rather than earned by the original owner. If assets are later transferred back to an individual, then capital gains taxes would apply on all profits. Also income tax would still be due on any salary or dividend drawn from the legal entity.

For a settlor (creator of a trust) to avoid tax there may be restrictions on the type, purpose and beneficiaries of the trust. For example, the settlor of the trust may not be allowed to be a trustee or even a beneficiary and may thus lose control of the assets transferred and/or may be unable to benefit from them.

===Legal vagueness===
Tax results depend on definitions of legal terms which are usually vague. For example, vagueness of the distinction between &quot;business expenses&quot; and &quot;personal expenses&quot; is of much concern for taxpayers and tax authorities. More generally, any term of tax law has a vague penumbra, and is a potential source of tax avoidance.

===Tax shelters===

Tax shelters are investments that allow, and purport to allow, a reduction in one&#x27;s income tax liability. Although things such as home ownership, pension plans, and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) can be broadly considered &quot;tax shelters&quot;, insofar as funds in them are not taxed, provided that they are held within the Individual Retirement Account for the required amount of time, the term &quot;tax shelter&quot; was originally used to describe primarily certain investments made in the form of limited partnerships, some of which were deemed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be abusive.

The Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Justice have recently teamed up to crack down on abusive tax shelters. In 2003 the Senate&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held hearings about tax shelters which are entitled &quot;U.S. tax shelter industry: the role of accountants, lawyers, and financial professionals&quot;. Many of these tax shelters were designed and provided by accountants at the large American accounting firms.

Examples of U.S. tax shelters include: Foreign Leveraged Investment Program (FLIP) and Offshore Portfolio Investment Strategy (OPIS). Both were devised by partners at the accounting firm, KPMG. These tax shelters were also known as &quot;basis shifts&quot; or &quot;defective redemptions.&quot;

Prior to 1987, passive investors in certain limited partnerships (such as oil exploration or real estate investment ventures) were allowed to use the passive losses (if any) of the partnership (i.e., losses generated by partnership operations in which the investor took no material active part) to offset the investors&#x27; income, lowering the amount of income tax that otherwise would be owed by the investor. These partnerships could be structured so that an investor in a high tax bracket could obtain a net economic benefit from partnership-generated passive losses.

In the Tax Reform Act of 1986 the U.S. Congress introduced the limitation (under ) on the deduction of passive losses and the use of passive activity tax credits. The 1986 Act also changed the &quot;at risk&quot; loss rules of . Coupled with the hobby loss rules (), the changes greatly reduced tax avoidance by taxpayers engaged in activities only to generate deductible losses.

===Transfer mispricing===

Fraudulent transfer pricing, sometimes called &quot;transfer mispricing&quot;, also known as &quot;transfer pricing manipulation&quot;, refers to trade between related parties at prices meant to manipulate markets or to deceive tax authorities.

For example, if company &quot;A&quot;, a food grower in Africa, processes its produce through three subsidiaries: &quot;X&quot; (in Africa), &quot;Y&quot; (in a tax haven, usually offshore financial centers) and &quot;Z&quot; (in the United States). Now, Company &quot;X&quot; sells its product to Company &quot;Y&quot; at an artificially low price, resulting in a low profit and a low tax for Company &quot;X&quot; based in Africa. Company &quot;Y&quot; then sells the product to Company &quot;Z&quot; at an artificially high price, almost as high as the retail price at which Company &quot;Z&quot; would sell the final product in the U.S.. Company &quot;Z&quot;, as a result, would report a low profit and, therefore, a low tax.

The African Union reports estimates that about 30% of Sub-Saharan Africa&#x27;s GDP has been moved to tax havens. Solutions include corporate “country-by-country reporting” where corporations disclose activities in each country and thereby prohibit the use of tax havens where real economic activity occurs.

==Tax avoiders==
According to a 2022 study, 36% of the profits of multinational firms are shifted to tax havens. If the profits had been reallocated to their domestic source, &quot;domestic profits would increase by about 20% in high-tax European Union countries, 10% in the United States, and 5% in developing countries, while they would fall by 55% in tax havens.&quot;

===United Kingdom===
HMRC, the UK tax collection agency, estimated that the overall cost of tax avoidance in the UK in 2016-17 was £1.7 billion, of which £0.7 billion was loss of income tax, National Insurance contributions and Capital Gains Tax. The rest came from loss of Corporation Tax, VAT and other direct taxes. This compares to the wider tax gap (the difference between the amount of tax that should, in theory, be collected by HMRC, against what is actually collected) in that year of £33 billion.

Figures published by the Tax Justice Network show that the UK had one of the lowest rates of tax losses due to profit shifting by multinational companies, with the fourth lowest rate out of 102 countries studied. According to the figures, the UK lost £1 billion from profit shifting, around 0.04% of its GDP, coming behind Botswana (0.02%), Ecuador (0.02%) and Sweden (0.004%).

====Large companies accused of tax avoidance====
In 2008 it was reported by Private Eye that Tesco utilized offshore holding companies in Luxembourg and partnership agreements to reduce corporation tax liability by up to £50 million a year. Another scheme previously identified by Private Eye involved depositing £1 billion in a Swiss partnership, and then loaning out that money to overseas Tesco stores, so that profit can be transferred indirectly through interest payments. This scheme is reported to remain in operation and is estimated to be costing the UK exchequer up to £20 million a year in corporation tax.

In 2011, ActionAid reported that 25% of the FTSE 100 companies avoided taxation by locating their subsidiaries in tax havens. This increased to 98% when using the stricter US Congress definition of tax haven and bank secrecy jurisdictions. In 2016, it was reported in the &quot;Private Eye&quot; current affairs magazine that four out of the FTSE top 10 companies paid no corporation tax at all.&lt;ref name=&quot;PEye24/1/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax avoidance by corporations came to national attention in 2012, when MPs singled out Google, Amazon.com and Starbucks for criticism. Following accusations that the three companies were diverting hundreds of millions of pounds in UK profits to secretive tax havens, there was widespread outrage across the UK, followed by boycotts of products by Google, Amazon.com and Starbucks. 
Following the boycotts and damage to brand image, Starbucks promised to move its tax base from the Netherlands to London and to pay HMRC £20million, but executives from Amazon.com and Google defended their tax avoidance as being within the law.

Google has remained the subject of criticism in the UK regarding their use of the &#x27;Double Irish&#x27;, Dutch Sandwich and Bermuda Black Hole tax avoidance schemes. Similarly, Amazon remains the subject of criticism across the UK and EU for its tax avoidance. In October 2017, the EU ordered Amazon to repay €250 million in illegal state aid to Luxembourg following a &#x27;sweetheart deal&#x27; between Luxembourg and Amazon.com enabling the American company to artificially reduce its tax bill. PayPal, EBay, Microsoft, Twitter and Facebook have also been found to be using the Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich schemes. Up to 1,000 individuals in the same year were also discovered to be using K2 to avoid tax.

Other UK active corporations mentioned in relation to tax avoidance in 2015, particularly the Double Irish, Dutch Sandwich and Bermuda Black Hole:
* Technology: Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, EBay, Intel, Yahoo!, Facebook, Uber, Netflix, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Twitter
* Retail: Boots (who moved their registered office to a Swiss letterbox), Kellogg&#x27;s, and TopShop
* Football clubs: Manchester United, Birmingham City, Coventry City and Cheltenham Town.
* News: Daily Mail
Other corporations mentioned in relation to tax avoidance in later years have been Vodafone, AstraZeneca, SABMiller, GlaxoSmithKline and British American Tobacco.

Tax avoidance has not always related to corporation tax. A number of companies including Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s, WH Smith, Boots and Marks and Spencer used a scheme to avoid VAT by forcing customers paying by card to unknowingly pay a 2.5% &#x27;card transaction fee&#x27;, though the total charged to the customer remained the same. Such schemes came to light after HMRC litigated against Debenhams over the scheme during 2005.

Africa lost at least $50 million in taxes. This is more than the amount of foreign development aid. European companies operating in Africa are not all that different from the actions of US companies such as Google, Apple and Amazon do not pay enough taxes because of tax avoidance.

According to the Independent Commission for International Corporate Tax Reform (ICRICT), the ‘GAFA’ (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon) belong to the worst tax offenders worldwide. In 2018, Amazon was not charged any corporate taxes in the US for two years in a row, despite its doubling profits. Other multinationals, such as Apple for example, also exploit fiscal loopholes, diverting profits from high tax countries into others with lower corporate tax rates. As these large Internet companies disproportionally profit from the COVID-19 crisis, and the US federal government no longer participates in international corporate taxation agreements, single countries and trading zones are urged to implement fair taxation schemes for these Internet giants.

====General anti-avoidance rule====
Since the late 1990s, New Labour consulted on a &quot;general anti-avoidance rule&quot; (GAAR) for taxation, before deciding against the idea. By 2003, public interest in a GAAR surged as evidence of the scale of tax avoidance used by individuals in the financial and other sectors became apparent, though in its 2004 Budget the Labour Government announced a new &quot;disclosure regime&quot; as an alternative, whereby tax avoidance schemes would be required to be disclosed to the revenue departments.

In December 2010, the new Coalition government commissioned a report which would consider whether there should be a general anti-avoidance rule for the UK, which recommended that the UK should introduce such a rule, which was introduced in 2013. The rule prevents the reduction of tax by legal arrangements, where those arrangements are put in place purely to reduce tax, and would not otherwise be regarded as a reasonable course of action.

Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, &quot;Private Eye&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and other British media outlets noted that Edward Troup, who became executive chair of HM Revenue and Customs, had worked with Simmons &amp; Simmons in 2004 representing corporate tax havens and opposed the GAAR in 1998.

====Public sector appointments====
In January 2012 a review of the tax arrangements of people engaged on public sector appointments was undertaken, in order to &quot;ascertain the extent
of arrangements which could allow public sector appointees to minimise their tax payments&quot; and make recommendations accordingly. The review was published on 23 May 2012, advising that:
*the most senior staff in public sector appointments should be on the payroll, unless there are exceptional temporary circumstances;
*through their contracting, departments must be able to seek formal assurance from contractors with off payroll arrangements lasting more than six months and costing over £220 per day that income tax and national insurance obligations were being met. Departments were advised to terminate a contract if that assurance was not provided;
*implementation would be monitored carefully with financial sanctions for departments which did not comply.

====Historical tax avoidance====
=====Window tax=====

One historic example of tax avoidance still evident today was the payment of window tax. It was introduced in England and Wales in 1696 with the aim of imposing tax on the relative prosperity of individuals without the controversy of introducing an income tax. The bigger the house, the more windows it was likely to have, and the more tax the occupants would pay. Nevertheless, the tax was unpopular, because it was seen by some as a &quot;tax on light&quot; (allegedly leading to the phrase daylight robbery) and led property owners to block up windows to avoid it. The tax was repealed in 1851.

=====Deliberate roof destruction=====
Other historic examples of tax avoidance were the deliberate destructions of roofs in Scotland to avoid substantial property taxes. The roof of Slains Castle was removed in 1925, and the building has deteriorated since. The owners of Fetteresso Castle (now restored) deliberately destroyed their roof after World War II in protest at the new taxes.

===United States===
The term tax avoidance indicates a situation in which a taxpayer legally minimizes the amount of his income tax owed. This circumstance occurs by declaring as many deductions and credits as permitted or prioritizing investments with tax advantages.

An IRS report indicates that, in 2009, 1,470 individuals earning more than $1,000,000 annually faced a net tax liability of zero or less. Also, in 1998 alone, a total of 94 corporations faced a net liability of less than half the full 35% corporate tax rate and the corporations Lyondell Chemical, Texaco, Chevron, CSX, Tosco, PepsiCo, Owens &amp; Minor, Pfizer, JP Morgan, Saks, Goodyear, Ryder, Enron, Colgate-Palmolive, Worldcom, Eaton, Weyerhaeuser, General Motors, El Paso Energy, Westpoint Stevens, MedPartners, Phillips Petroleum, McKesson and Northrop Grumman all had net negative tax liabilities. Additionally, this phenomenon was widely documented regarding General Electric in early 2011.

Furthermore, a Government Accountability Office study found that, from 1998 to 2005, 55 percent of United States companies paid no federal income taxes during at least one year in a seven-year period it studied. A review in 2011 by Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy of companies in the Fortune 500 profitable every year from 2008 through 2010 stated these companies paid an average tax rate of 18.5% and that 30 of these companies actually had a negative income tax due.

In 2012, Hewlett-Packard lost a lawsuit with the IRS over a &quot;foreign tax credit generator&quot; which was engineered by a division of AIG. Al Jazeera also wrote in 2012 that &quot;Rich individuals and their families have as much as $32 trillion of hidden financial assets in offshore tax havens, representing up to $280bn in lost income tax revenues ... John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network told Al Jazeera that he was shocked by &#x27;the sheer scale of the figures&#x27;. ... &#x27;We&#x27;re talking about very big, well-known brands – HSBC, Citigroup, Bank of America, UBS, Credit Suisse ... and they do it knowing fully well that their clients, more often than not, are evading and avoiding taxes.&#x27; Much of this activity, Christensen added, was illegal.&quot;

As a result of the tax sheltering, the government responded with Treasury Department Circular 230. In 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 codified the &quot;economic substance&quot; rule of &quot;Gregory v. Helvering&quot; (1935).

The US Public Interest Research Group said in 2014 that the United States government loses roughly $184 billion per year due to corporations such as Pfizer, Microsoft and Citigroup using offshore tax havens to avoid paying US taxes. According to PIRG:
*Pfizer paid no US income taxes 2010–2012, despite earning $43 billion. The corporation received more than $2 billion in federal tax refunds. In 2013, Pfizer operated 128 subsidiaries in tax havens and had $69 billion offshore which could not be collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS);
*Microsoft maintains five tax haven subsidiaries and held $76.4 billion overseas in 2013, thus saving the corporation $24.4 billion in taxes;
*Citigroup maintained 21 subsidiaries in tax haven countries in 2013, and kept $43.8 billion in offshore jurisdictions, thus saving the corporation an additional $11.7 billion in taxes.

According to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, global companies in the US are paying an effective tax rate of about negative 9 percent per annum.

An investigation by ProPublica published in 2021 based on leaked IRS documents revealed techniques by which billionaires accumulated massive wealth while paying lower rates than middle-income people, or no tax, or in some cases getting paid refundable childcare tax credits.
These include:
* Instead of a salary taxed at the 37% top rate, accepting stock, which is taxed at the 20% capital gains rate.
* Avoid paying tax on capital gains with the &quot;buy, borrow, die&quot; technique:
** Buy or earn capital assets like stocks and real estate, and then never sell because assets do not count as income until sold.
** Using capital assets as collateral to borrow spending money at interest rates considerably lower than the tax rate; loans are not taxed as income.
** Holding capital assets until after death, when a &quot;step-up in basis&quot; zeroes out the accumulated gains and allows heirs to not pay any capital gains tax.
* Avoid the estate tax by moving money into trusts or charitable foundations before death
* Offset dividend income with the interest paid on loans, or relying on increasing stock prices instead of a dividend
* Offset income with &quot;paper&quot; losses in business operations
* Offset income with charitable contributions
Tax avoidance, albeit legal, is subjected to civil penalties findable in the IRC § 6651 (a)(2); §6665(a)(1); §6665(b)(1); §6662.

There are four main types of penalties:

* Due date and extensions of time to file and pay: occurs when the taxpayer fails to present his tax declaration or pay his tax income on the expected time.
* Penalty for failure to file a timely return: is a monetary sanction imposed by the IRS when the taxpayer fails to meet the deadline to file his return. It consists of an increased rate of 5% and not over 25% for every month - or part of it- of payment delay upon the original tax import. If the return was filed with a delay of more than 60 days, the minimum penalty is $435 (for tax returns that had to be filed in 2020) or 100% of the tax required.
* Penalty for failure to timely pay taxes: this penalty is calculated on how long overdue taxes remain unpaid. It consists of an increased rate of 0.5% of the unpaid tax for every month or part of a month in which remains, so that is applied on the total amount of the due tax, and this addiction cannot exceed, in any case, the 25% of the total amount of the unpaid taxes.
* Penalty for failure to pay estimated taxes: in the American tax system, the taxpayer has to pay his tax liability upon his annual earnings or income with estimated tax payments. Whether these estimated tax payments are assumed insufficient by the IRS, in this instance, the taxpayer will be subjected to a penalty for the failure to pay the estimated tax. The taxpayer can avoid this penalty if the amount due by the taxpayer is less than $1,000 or if it was already paid, with the withholds and estimated tax system, at least 90% of the current year&#x27;s tax or 100% of the previous year&#x27;s tax.
* Accuracy-related penalties: these sanctions are applied when it can be acknowledged the negligence or disregard of the return&#x27;s rules, or when there is a substantial understatement (of 10% or $1,000 or 5% or $5,000 for the taxpayers who use section 199 A) of the taxpayer&#x27;s income. This penalty can be avoided if the taxpayer was in bona fide or can reasonably demonstrate the reasons for failure.

In addition, there are more situations in which the IRS does not impose the penalties discussed above. Instead, they are the so-called reasonable cause exception to the failure to file or pay taxes and consist of:

# fire, natural disaster, or other calamities
# Inability, unrelated to the taxpayer, to obtain the documents necessary for the declaration
# Death, serious illness, incapacity, or unavoidable absence of the taxpayer or a close family member
# Any other reason useful to demonstrate that the taxpayer used the diligence and the prudence ordinarily necessary to fulfill federal tax obligations but could not perform his duties for reasons not dependable on him.

==Public opinion==
Tax avoidance may be considered to be the dodging of one&#x27;s duties to society, or alternatively the right of every citizen to structure one&#x27;s affairs in a manner allowed by law, to pay no more tax than what is required. Attitudes vary from approval through neutrality to outright hostility. Attitudes may vary depending on the steps taken in the avoidance scheme, or the perceived unfairness of the tax being avoided.

In 2008, the charity Christian Aid published a report, &quot;Death and taxes: the true toll of tax dodging&quot;, which criticised tax exiles and tax avoidance by some of the world&#x27;s largest companies, linking tax evasion to the deaths of millions of children in developing countries. However the research behind these calculations has been questioned in a 2009 paper prepared for the UK Department for International Development. According to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; there is a growing trend for charities to prioritise tax avoidance as a key campaigning issue, with policy makers across the world considering changes to make tax avoidance more difficult.

In 2010, tax avoidance became a hot-button issue in the UK. An organisation, UK Uncut, began to encourage people to protest at local high-street shops that were thought to be avoiding tax, such as Vodafone, Topshop and the Arcadia Group.

In 2012, during the Occupy movement in the United States, tax avoidance for the 99% was proposed as a protest tool.

Prem Sikka, Professor of Accounting at the Essex Business School (University of Essex) and scientific advisor of the Tax Justice Network pointed to a discrepancy between the Corporate Social Responsibility claims of multinational companies and “their internal dynamics aimed at maximising their profits through things like tax avoidance”. He wrote in an article commenting the Lux Leaks publications: “Big corporations and accountancy firms are engaged in organised hypocrisy.”

===Fair Tax Mark===
As a response to public opinion regarding tax avoidance, the Fair Tax Mark was established in the UK during 2014 as an independent certification scheme to identify and recognise companies which pay taxes &quot;in accordance with the spirit of all tax laws&quot; and not to use options, allowances, or reliefs, or undertake specific transactions, &quot;that are contrary to the spirit of the law&quot;.

The Mark is operated by a not-for-profit community benefit society, the Fair Tax Foundation.

Awardees of this mark include The Co-op, SSE, Go-Ahead Group, Ecology Building Society, Lush Cosmetics, Richer Sounds, Scottish Water, United Utilities, Marshalls, several large regional co-operatives (East of England, Midcounties, Scotmid) and The Phone Co-op.

==Government and judicial response==

Tax avoidance reduces government revenue, so governments with a stricter anti-avoidance stance seek to prevent tax avoidance or keep it within limits. The obvious way to do this is to frame tax rules so that there is a smaller scope for avoidance. In practice this has not always been achievable and has led to an ongoing battle between governments amending legislation and tax advisors finding new scope/loopholes for tax avoidance in the amended rules.

To allow prompter response to tax avoidance schemes, the US Tax Disclosure Regulations (2003) require prompter and fuller disclosure than previously required, a tactic which was applied in the UK in 2004.

Some countries such as Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand have introduced a statutory General Anti-Avoidance Rule (or General Anti-Abuse Rule, GAAR). Canada also uses Foreign Accrual Property Income rules to obviate certain types of tax avoidance. In the United Kingdom many provisions of the tax legislation (known as &quot;anti-avoidance&quot; provisions) apply to prevent tax avoidance where the main object (or purpose), or one of the main objects (or purposes), of a transaction is to enable tax advantages to be obtained.

In the United States, the Internal Revenue Service distinguishes some schemes as &quot;abusive&quot; and therefore illegal. The Alternative Minimum Tax was developed to reduce the impact of certain tax avoidance schemes. Furthermore, while tax avoidance is in principle legal, if the IRS in its sole judgment determines that tax avoidance is the &#x27;principal purpose&#x27; for an expatriation attempt, &#x27;covered expat&#x27; status will be applied to the requester, thereby forcing an expatriation tax on worldwide assets to be paid as a condition of expatriation. The IRS presumes a principal purpose of tax avoidance if a taxpayer requesting expatriation has a net worth of $622,000 or more, or has had more than $124,000 in average annual net income tax over the 5 tax years ending before the date of expatriation.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, judicial doctrines to prevent tax avoidance began in &quot;IRC v Ramsay&quot; (1981) which decided that where a transaction has pre-arranged artificial steps that serve no commercial purpose other than to save tax, the proper approach is to tax the effect of the transaction as a whole. This is known as the Ramsay principle and this case was followed by &quot;Furniss v. Dawson&quot; (1984) which extended the Ramsay principle. This approach has been rejected in most Commonwealth jurisdictions even in those where UK cases are generally regarded as persuasive. After two decades, there have been numerous decisions, with inconsistent approaches, and both the Revenue authorities and professional advisors remain quite unable to predict outcomes. For this reason this approach can be seen as a failure or at best only partly successful.

In the judiciary, different judges have taken different attitudes. As a generalisation, for example, judges in the United Kingdom before the 1970s regarded tax avoidance with neutrality; but nowadays they may regard aggressive tax avoidance with increasing hostility.

In the UK in 2004, the Labour government announced that it would use retrospective legislation to counteract some tax avoidance schemes, and it has subsequently done so on a few occasions, notably BN66. Initiatives announced in 2010 suggest an increasing willingness on the part of HMRC to use retrospective action to counter avoidance schemes, even when no warning has been given.

The UK Government has pushed the initiative led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on base erosion and profit shifting. In the 2015 Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne announced that £800m would be spent on tackling tax avoidance in order to recover £5 billion a year by 2019–20. In addition, large companies will now have to publish their UK tax strategies and any large businesses that persistently engage in aggressive tax planning will be subject to special measures. With these policies, Osborne has claimed to be at the forefront of combating tax avoidance. However, he has been criticised over his perceived inaction on enacting policies set forth by the OECD to combat tax avoidance.

In April 2015, the Chancellor George Osborne announced a tax on diverted profits, quickly nicknamed the &quot;Google Tax&quot; by the press, designed to discourage large companies moving profits out of the UK to avoid tax. In 2016, Google agreed to pay back £130m of tax dating back to 2005 to HMRC, which said it was the &quot;full tax due in law&quot;. However, this amount of tax has been criticised by Labour, with ex Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn saying that the rate of tax paid by Google only amounted to 3%. Former Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable also said Google had &quot;got off very, very lightly&quot;, and Osborne &quot;made a fool of himself&quot; by hailing the deal as a victory. Although claiming that it was &quot;absurd&quot; to lay blame onto Google for tax avoidance, saying that EU member states should &quot;[compete] with each other to offer firms the lowest corporate tax rates&quot;, Conservative MP Boris Johnson said it was a &quot;good thing&quot; for corporations to pay more tax. However, Johnson said he did not want tax rates to go up or for European Union countries to do this in unison.

<doc id="447438" wikidata="Q16153271" url="?curid=447438" title="1947 Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado outbreak">
<text>From April 9–11, 1947, a significant tornado outbreak produced catastrophic effects over portions of the southern Great Plains, in the contiguous United States. The outbreak generated at least 12, and possibly 17 or more, tornadoes, many of which were significant. On Wednesday, April 9, a series of related tornadoes spawned by a single supercell, dubbed the Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornadoes, swept through the U.S. states of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Most of the damage and nearly all of the deaths are still blamed on one large tornado, known as the Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado, that traveled from Texas to Oklahoma, beginning over the South Plains. This event, up to nearly in width, was often compared to the Tri-State tornado, because it was originally thought to have left a path, was similarly large and intense for much of its path, and was also retroactively rated F5 on the modern-day Fujita scale, but it is now believed to have been part of a family of nine or 10 tornadoes.

==Background==
Early on April 9, the United States Weather Bureau in Amarillo, Texas, forecast late-afternoon temperatures of about over the Texas panhandle. At the time, dense, low-lying stratus and a layer of fog were present, with temperatures ranging from the upper 40s to low 50s °F. However, an approaching warm front—then extended from Sherman, Texas, to Raton, New Mexico—would later combine with a robust trough aloft to enhance conditions for severe weather. In tandem with this, a low-pressure area over northeastern New Mexico, along with an attendant dry line, would gradually eject, leading to stronger low-level wind shear and more pronounced lapse rates. Around 2:00 p.m. CST (18:00 UTC), helicity was near 135 m2/s2, but would decline afterward. As it did so, however, an unexpected decrease in cloud cover allowed for greater-than-expected diurnal heating, leading to a substantial rise in atmospheric instability and associated buoyancy. By 6:30 p.m. CST (00:30 UTC), the low-pressure center was situated over southern Colorado, and a jet stream existed above sea level. Surface-based temperatures quickly reached the upper 60s °F. In the mixed layer, the convective available potential energy (CAPE) rose above 1,100 j/kg, and the lifted condensation level (LCL) was just above ground level, along with a level of free convection (LFC) of . Mixed-layer convective inhibition by then had decreased, offsetting the loss of helicity, and the presence of the warm front acted in concert with the aforementioned factors to favor supercells capable of generating strong tornadoes. Gusts of attended the passage of a cold front overnight.

==Confirmed tornadoes==

*A possible tornado may have flattened a barn just south of Carpenter, Oklahoma, on April 9.

Prior to 1990, there is a likely undercount of tornadoes, particularly E/F0–1, with reports of weaker tornadoes becoming more common as population increased. A sharp increase in the annual average E/F0–1 count by approximately 200 tornadoes was noted upon the implementation of NEXRAD Doppler weather radar in 1990–1991. 1974 marked the first year where significant tornado (E/F2+) counts became homogenous with contemporary values, attributed to the consistent implementation of Fujita scale assessments. Numerous discrepancies on the details of tornadoes in this outbreak exist between sources. The total count of tornadoes and ratings differs from various agencies accordingly. The list below documents information from the most contemporary official sources alongside assessments from tornado historian Thomas P. Grazulis.

===Glazier–Higgins, Texas/Woodward, Oklahoma===

Moving at an average of , this extremely large and violent tornado was first confirmed near Canadian, Texas. When it struck the tiny town of Glazier, it may have been as much as wide. Most structures in town were swept completely away and scattered. Vehicles in the area were thrown hundreds of yards and mangled, shrubbery was debarked, and ground scouring occurred. Glazier was considered completely destroyed, with 17 dead, a major percentage of the populace. Press reports told of two people who were known to be together in Glazier before the tornado struck were found apart afterward. The tornado maintained its intensity as it slammed into Higgins, on the Texas–Oklahoma border, which was also devastated. The accepted death toll here was 51; again, a major fraction of the residents of the town were killed or injured. Much of downtown Higgins was completely demolished, and entire rows of homes were swept away. At one residence, a lathe was reportedly ripped from its anchors and broken in half.

After killing at least one other person, the tornado crossed the state line and entered Oklahoma. There the tornado was at its worst—the deadliest storm in that state&#x27;s tornado-troubled history. Six more people were killed when the tornado swept away about 60 ranches and farms south of Shattuck, Gage, and Fargo. During its trek, the funnel was so wide and low to the ground that it did not resemble a prototypical tornado. The tornado then moved into Woodward, where it devastated the town and killed an estimated 107 people. The damage that occurred in Woodward was catastrophic. There, the tornado was wide and destroyed 100 city blocks. Many homes and businesses were leveled or swept away, and as the tornado struck the town&#x27;s power plant, a steel boiler tank was lofted and thrown a block and a half. Large trees sustained severe debarking as well. The tornado finally dissipated in Woods County, west of Alva, where it wrecked 36 homes and injured 30 people.

Cleanup in the region was made more difficult because of cold and snow that followed the tornado. Four-year-old Joan Gay Croft and her sister Jerri were among refugees taking shelter in a basement hallway of the Woodward hospital. As officials sent the injured to different hospitals in the area, two men took Joan away, saying they were taking her to Oklahoma City. She was never seen again. Over the years, several women have come forth saying they suspect they might be Joan, although none of the claims have been verified. She is likely deceased. The Glazier–Higgins–Woodward tornado was the sixth deadliest in U.S. history, killing 184 and injuring 980; of these figures, 116 deaths and 782 injuries occurred in Oklahoma. An undetermined number of additional fatalities may have occurred in both states affected. In all, the tornado destroyed 626 homes and damaged 920 others, becoming the costliest on record in Oklahoma history.

==Aftermath and recovery==
A US Weather Bureau report on the Woodward, Oklahoma Tornado of April 9, 1947, gives the following figures on the damage caused in its &quot;Original Summary&quot; section.
*Lipscomb County, Texas – 36 homes flattened, 1 damaged
*Hemphill County, Texas – 83 homes leveled, 116 damaged
*Texas total – $1,505,000
*Ellis County, Oklahoma – $1,264,000
**52 homes destroyed, 133 damaged
**223 other buildings destroyed, 107 damaged
*Woodward County, Oklahoma – $6,608,750
**430 homes destroyed, 650 damaged
**925 other buildings destroyed, 975 damaged
*Woods County, Oklahoma – $950,000
**25 homes destroyed, 34 damaged
**110 other buildings destroyed, 90 damaged
*Kansas total – $200,000

Total damage estimates were $173,489,564 (equivalent to $747,850,050 in 2008 dollars).

<doc id="447440" wikidata="Q4928714" url="?curid=447440" title="Blue-collar crime">
<text>In criminology, blue-collar crime is any crime committed by an individual from a lower social class as opposed to white-collar crime which is associated with crime committed by someone of a higher-level social class. While blue-collar crime has no official legal classification, it holds to a general net group of crimes. These crimes are primarily small scale, for immediate beneficial gain to the individual or group involved in them. This can also include personal related crimes that can be driven by immediate reaction, such as during fights or confrontations. These crimes include but are not limited to: Narcotic production or distribution, sexual assault, theft, burglary, assault or murder.

== Etymology ==
Blue-collar crime is a term used to identify crime, normally of a small scale nature in contrast to “white-collar crime”, and is generally attributed to people of the lower class. During the 1910s through to the 1920s in America, manual labourers often opted for blue shirts, so that stains gained from days at work were less visible. As during that time period and geographic location manual labour was often or almost exclusively assigned to the lower classes, the term was more permanently attributed to them as defining low income earners. This has carried on to the modern day, therefore meaning crime typically committed by lower classes. It is important to note that blue-collar crime does not exclusively address low income earners in work, but also includes the unemployed who are also members of the lower classes.

==Causes==
A dominant explanation for why people turn to crime is economic need and specifically unemployment. The unemployed are defined as persons above a specified age who, during the reference period, were without work, were currently available for work, and were seeking work -- according to The International Conference of Labour Statisticians. 

The process of industrialisation encouraged working-class incorporation into society with greater social mobility being achieved during the twentieth century. But the routine of policing tends to focus on the public places where the economically marginal live out more of their lives, so regulation falls on those who are not integrated into the mainstream institutions of economic and political life. A perennial source of conflict has therefore involved working-class youth but, as long-term structural unemployment emerged, an underclass was created. Ralf Dahrendorf argues that the majority class did not need the unemployed to maintain and even increase its standard of living, and so the condition of the underclass became hopeless. Box (1987) sums up the research into crime and unemployment at pp96–7:
:The relationship between overall unemployment and crime is inconsistent. On balance the weight of existing research supports there being a weak but none-the-less significant causal relationship. However, properly targeted research on young males, particularly those from disadvantaged ethnic groups, which considers both the meaning and duration of unemployment, has yet to be done. The significance of unemployment will vary depending on its duration, social assessments of blame, previous experience of steady employment, perception of future prospects, comparison with other groups, etc. Hence, there is likely to be a causal relationship between relative deprivation and crime, particularly where unemployment is perceived as unjust and hopeless by comparison with the lot of other groups. Thornberry and Christenson (1984) analysed data from a longitudinal cohort study of delinquency in Philadelphia and found (at p405):
:Unemployment exerts a rather immediate effect on criminal involvement, while criminal involvement exerts a more long-range effect on unemployment. What this and other empirical research demonstrates is that crime-rates, especially for property offences, were higher during periods of unemployment than of employment. This suggests that holding constant other variables, the same youths commit more crimes while unemployed. This is not surprising since unemployment provides an incentive to commit offences and erodes the social controls which would otherwise encourage conformity. But crime also rose during the so-called period of affluence, prompting the Right Realism of James Q. Wilson and his associates in the United States who argued that the criminal justice system was failing, and the Left Realism attributed to Jock Young, which argued for situational changes to reduce the availability of criminal opportunities in the environment. More generally, the growth of anomie (see Durkheim and, more recently, the Strain Theory proposed by Merton), predicted a strong correlation between unemployment and property crime. But Cantor and Land (1985) found a negative association for unemployment and property crime in the United States. They argued that unemployment decreases the opportunity for property crime since it reflects a general slowdown in.

However, there is an explanation for this correlation between unemployment and tendencies towards crime. A study found that both social standing in the classes and the employment status of offenders found them more likely to be detained, arrested and prosecuted by Law Enforcement. Further it came to the conclusion that unemployed persons were more likely to be dealt harsher punishments, and be looked upon unfavourably by the justice system, based on their employment status.

Conservatism alleges the failure of state agencies charged with the task of socialisation to instil self-discipline and moral values resulting in permissiveness, a lack of conformity, and liberalisation. The &quot;evidence&quot; that there are new affluent criminals allows populist politicians to deny any link between inner-city deprivation and crime. The left avoids the issue of morality and crime which denies earlier work in Marxist criminology linking crime and the culture of egoism stimulated by economic advance under capitalism as a more amorally materialistic culture emerges. As Durkheim asserted, moral education cannot be effective in an economically unjust society. Thus, additional research is required, using a more complex model of crime and control to include variables such as opportunities or incentives relative to a country&#x27;s standard of living, potential punishment, chance of being caught, law enforcement efforts and expenditures on theft and property crime relative to other crimes, size of the country&#x27;s criminal population, education levels, and other socio-economic factors. A further factor currently being researched is the role of the media in the social construction of &quot;hot spots&quot; or dangerous places within a city. Crime is a substantial element in media news reporting. Media research is now determining whether the coverage of crime is spatially representative of where crime occurs, or disproportionately presents crime as occurring in certain areas of a city, thereby skewing public perceptions and the political response (see Paulsen: 2002).

In Australia a study undertaken, focusing on Aboriginal Australians, researched into the varying crime rates between similar communities. Some of these communities that they compared lived in both similar geographically and demographically. What they found was that the offence rate was likely tied to a cultural aspect of the community that existed. They found that the upbringing of families to their youngers, as well as how the community developed, has a far larger effect on blue-collar related crimes than employment or income.(McCausland &amp; Vivian, 2010).

Rather than unemployment being the sole or a primary contributing factor towards crime rates, there is evidence pointing towards a greater set of factors that can even contribute towards unemployment itself. According to this study the factors that lead to crime should be collected into different clusters: personality of the individual, family, school, peers and work.

<doc id="447445" wikidata="Q7032758" url="?curid=447445" title="Niger Delta Basin (geology)">
<text>The Niger Delta Basin, also referred to as the Niger Delta province, is an extensional rift basin located in the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea on the passive continental margin near the western coast of Nigeria with suspected or proven access to Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe. This basin is very complex, and it carries high economic value as it contains a very productive petroleum system. The Niger delta basin is one of the largest subaerial basins in Africa. It has a subaerial area of about 75,000 km2, a total area of 300,000 km2, and a sediment fill of 500,000 km3. The sediment fill has a depth between 9–12 km. It is composed of several different geologic formations that indicate how this basin could have formed, as well as the regional and large scale tectonics of the area. The Niger Delta Basin is an extensional basin surrounded by many other basins in the area that all formed from similar processes. The Niger Delta Basin lies in the south westernmost part of a larger tectonic structure, the Benue Trough. The other side of the basin is bounded by the Cameroon Volcanic Line and the transform passive continental margin.

==Basin formation==
The Niger Delta Basin was formed by a failed rift junction during the separation of the South American Plate and the African Plate, as the South Atlantic began to open. Rifting in this basin started in the late Jurassic and ended in the mid Cretaceous. As rifting continued, several faults formed many of them thrust faults. Also at this time syn-rift sands and then shales were deposited in the late Cretaceous. This indicates that the shoreline regressed during this time. Concurrently, the basin had been undergoing extension resulting in high angle normal faults and fault block rotation. At the beginning of the Paleocene there was a significant shoreline transgression. During the Paleocene, the Akata Formation was deposited, followed by the Agbada Formation during the Eocene. This loading caused the underlying shale Akata Formation to be squeezed into shale diapirs. Then in the Oligocene the Benin formation was deposited, which is still being deposited today. The overall basin is divided into a few different zones due to its tectonic structure. There is an extensional zone, which lies on the continental shelf, caused by the thickened crust. Moving basinward is a transition zone, and a contraction zone, which lies in the deep-sea part of the basin.

==Lithology==
The sediment fill in the Niger Delta basin is characterized by three major depobelts. These three cycles show that the basin experienced an overall regression throughout time as the sediments go from deep sea mud sized grains to fluvial denser sand sized grains. The lithologies of the area experience changes due to several factors. The sediment provenance from the onshore highlands which feed into the delta control the mineralogy of the grains. Additionally, the impact of sea level on sediment deposition is well known; relative sea level will control the basinward extent of lithologies (see sequence stratigraphy). Volcanic activity in the area may also result in thin deposits of ash (bentonite). The early Cretaceous sediments are thought to be from a tide-dominated system that were deposited on a concave shoreline, and throughout time the shoreline became and it is currently a wave-dominated system.

=== Basement ===
The oceanic basement rock is the oldest rock in the basin and is basaltic in composition. Also closer to the coast Precambrian continental basement crops out onshore.

=== Cretaceous ===
There is a section of rock in this basin from the middle to late Cretaceous which is poorly understood due to its significant burial depth. It is believed to be composed of sediments from a tide-dominated coastline, and there are believed to be several layers of shales, although their distribution is unconstrained.

=== Akata Formation ===
The Akata Formation is Paleocene in age. It is composed of thick shales, turbidite sands, and small amounts of silt and clay. The clay content resulted in it being a ductile shale formation which was squeezed into shale diapirs in the basin. The Akata Formation formed during lowstands in relative sea level and anoxic conditions. This formation is estimated to be up to 7,000 meters thick.

=== Agbada Formation ===
The Agbada Formation dates back to Eocene in age. It is a marine facies defined by both freshwater and deep sea characteristics. This is the major oil and natural gas-bearing facies in the basin. The hydrocarbons in this layer formed when this layer of rock became subaerial and was covered in a marsh-type environment rich in organic content. It is estimated to be 3,700 meters thick.

=== Benin Formation ===
The Benin Formation is Oligocene and younger in age. It is composed of continental flood plain sands and alluvial deposits. It is estimated to be up to 2,000 meters thick.

==Tectonic structures==
The tectonic structures in the Niger Delta Basin are typical of an extensional rift system, but the added shale diapirism due to loading makes this basin unique. The main method of deformation is gravitational collapse of the basin, although the older faulting and deformation in the basin are related to the continental breakup and rifting of the African plate and South American plates. The overall basin is divided into a few different zones due to its tectonic structure. There is an extensional zone, which lies on the continental shelf, that is caused by the thickened crust. There is a transition zone, and then there is a contraction zone, which lies in the deep sea part of the basin.

;Basin inversion
Basin inversion is caused by uplift and/or compression in this basin. The compression is caused by the toe detachment of the shale diapirs. Basin inversion forms anticline structures, which serve as a great oil trap. Clay smears in the sediments seal the formations so oil does not escape out.

;Basinward dipping reflectors
Basinward dipping reflectors are a common feature of extensional type rift basins. As fault blocks extend they rotate to dip towards the center of the basin. At the top of these fault blocks sub basins can form.

;Shale diapirs
The shale diapirs are from the Akata Formation. This structure is formed due to the improper dehydration of the formation and the over pressuring by the overlying and denser Agbada Formation.

;High-angle normal faulting
High-angle normal faulting is a feature of the extensional portion of the rifting in this basin. It is considered a growth fault and the feature lies closer towards the basins edge and transitions to the toe detachment faulting as you continue down the basin.

==Oil and Gas==
The Niger Delta is the twelfth largest province in the world by known oil and gas resources. The Niger Delta Basin produces around 2 million barrels of oil per day. The entire system is predicted to contain 34.5 billion barrels of oil and 94 trillion feet3 of natural gas. This area is still very heavily explored by oil companies today. It is one of the largest oil producers in the world.

===Oil Pollution===

In July 1979, an incident on the coastal zone of the Forcado tank 6 terminal spilled 570 thousand barrels of oil into the Forcados estuary, affecting the sea species and surrounding swamp forest. In January 1980, the Funiwa No.5 Well in Funiwa Field spilled 421 thousand barrels of oil into the ocean, damaging 836 acres of mangrove forest. In 1983, 5 000 barrels were spilled causing high mortality in crabs, fish and shrimps. Until 1999, an average of 240 thousand barrels of crude oil was spilled in the zone every year.

<text>Petr Chelčický (; c. 1390 – c. 1460) was a Czech Christian spiritual leader and author in the 15th century Bohemia, now the Czech Republic. He was one of the most influential thinkers of the Bohemian Reformation. Chelčický inspired the Unitas Fratrum, who opposed transubstantiation and monasticism, insisting on pacifism and the primacy of scripture. There are multiple parallels with the teachings of the Anabaptists and Chelčický. Czech Baptists have also expressed continuity with the Bohemian reformation by identifying with Chelčický.

His published works critiqued the immorality and violence of the contemporary church and state. He proposed a number of Bible-based improvements for human society, including nonresistance, which influenced humanitarians Tolstoy, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King. Paradoxically, the main part of the Hussite movement rejected his teachings of nonviolence, which eventually led to much violence among the Hussite movement. Chelcicky&#x27;s teachings laid the foundation of the Unity of the Brethren.

==Early life==

Petr Chelčický is thought to have been born in southern Bohemia in about 1390, although one theory puts his birth as early as 1374. Very little is known about his personal history. Different historians have called him a serf, an independent farmer, a squire, a nobleman, a cobbler, a priest, and a Waldensian. On one occasion, Chelčický called himself a peasant, but this description is at odds with his ability to live in Prague from 1419 to 1421, his rudimentary knowledge of Latin, and the time he was able to devote to literary, political, and religious pursuits.

It is certain that he was unusually literate for a medieval man without a regular academic education. After 1421, he lived and farmed in the village of Chelčice, near Vodňany. He produced 56 known works, but the majority remain unpublished and inaccessible except in the original manuscripts. His thinking was influenced by Thomas of Štítný, John Wycliffe, Jan Hus, and the Waldensian tradition. He died around 1460.

==Teachings==
Petr Chelčický&#x27;s teachings included ideas later adopted by the Moravians, Anabaptists, Quakers, and Baptists. He was the first pacifist writer of the Renaissance, predating Erasmus and Menno Simons by nearly 100 years.

=== Scripture ===
Petr Chelčický believed in a strict adherence to the principle of sola scriptura and read the bible in the vernacular. His strict adherence to sola scriptura caused Petr Chelčický to occasionally contradict John Wycliffe and other Hussites. He rejected the papacy and Catholic hierarchy, believing that the early church had no pope, kings, lords, inquisitions or crusaders.

Peter believed that purgatory is an example of the Church corrupting the New Testament by adding traditions, thus he denied the doctrine of purgatory. 

===Church and state===
Chelčický called the Pope and the emperor (the church and the state) &quot;whales who have torn the net of true faith&quot; because they established the church as the head of a secular empire. Chelčický believed that Christians should follow the law of love and so should not be compelled by state authority. He taught that the believer should not accept government office or even appeal to its authority, as for the true believer to take part in government was sinful. He argued that capital punishment and other forms of violent punishment were wrong. His positions on government are similar to the Christian anarchist principles of Leo Tolstoy. Tolstoy praised Chelčický&#x27;s work in his 1894 book &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot;.

&quot;The man who obeys God needs no other authority (over him).&quot; — Petr Chelčický

===Nonviolence and war===

As early as 1420, Chelčický taught that violence should not be used in religious matters. Chelčický used the parable of the wheat and the tares () to show that both the sinners and the saints should be allowed to live together until the harvest. He thought that it is wrong to kill even the sinful and that Christians should refuse military service. He argued that if the poor refused, the lords would have no one to go to war for them.

Chelčický taught that no physical power can destroy evil, and that Christians should accept persecution without retaliating. He believed that even defensive war was the worst evil and thought that soldiers were no more than murderers. He believed the example of Jesus and the Gospel was an example of peace.

===Communal living===
Chelčický believed that there must be complete equality in the Christian community. He said there should be no rich or poor since the Christian relinquished all property and status. He maintained that Christians could expel evil persons from their community but could not compel them to be good. He believed in equality but that the state should not force it upon society and went so far as to proffer that social inequality is a creature of the state and rises and falls with it.

According to Karl Kautsky in &quot;Communism in Central Europe in the Time of the Reformation&quot;, &quot;The nature of the first organisation of the Bohemian Brethren is not at all clear, as the later Brothers were ashamed of their communistic origin, and endeavoured to conceal it in every possible way.&quot; Some of Chelčický&#x27;s statements tend to indicate that he thought only the poor were genuine Christians.

===Priesthood of the believer===
Chelčický criticized the use of force in matters of faith. He taught that the Christian should strive for righteousness of his own free will but must not force others to be good and that goodness should be voluntary. He believed that the Christian must love God and one&#x27;s neighbor and that is the way to convert people rather than by compulsion. He maintained that any type of compulsion is evil and that Christians should not participate in political struggles.

=== Sacraments ===
Petr Chelčický advocated for baptism to be generally administered to those who are of later age. However he did not completely forbid infant baptism, allowing it if the parents would assure their education in the faith. He additionally did not propose re-baptism. Petr Chelčický did not believe that baptism by itself could save but is a part of the process of salvation which included instruction, confirmation and discipleship.

He additionally rejected transubstantiation but did not hold to memorialism which was taught by radical Hussites.

=== Other teachings ===
Petr Chelčický based his teaching on the Sermon on the Mount, renouncing violence, bearing arms and oaths. He also supported ascetism and believed celibacy to be a holier state than marriage.

Chelčický opposed indulgences and paying masses for the dead. Later he protested against the Utraquists making compromises with the Catholic church, seeing it as a reunion with the Antichrist.

Chelčický held that apostolic succession is not determined by laying on of hands but it is a matter of the clergy following the teaching of Christ.

==Author==
Chelčický is the author of approximately 50 treatises that have survived until today. All are written in Czech.

&quot;&quot; (&quot;On Spiritual Warfare&quot;), written in 1421, was his first major work. In it, Chelčický argued that the Taborites had participated in violence through the devil&#x27;s deceit and the lust for the things of the world. He also criticized the chiliasts, opposed physical warfare and noted that obligations of debts gave lenders power over debtors.

In &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Triple Division of Society&quot;) Chelčický criticized the nobility, the clergy and the middle class. He describes how they subjected the common people and rode them &quot;as if they were beasts&quot;.

His most comprehensive work, written around 1443 and one of his last, was &quot;&quot; (&quot;Net of Faith&quot;). He shows how the apostles treated all people as equals, and considered Christ as the only head. It was in this book that he argued that the emperor and the Pope were the two great whales that burst the net of faith. He also includes extensive commentary on the Council of Basel.

==Influence==

Chelčický has been called &quot;the foremost thinker of the 15th-century Czech Hussite Reformation movement.&quot; He certainly was an influential thinker among the Bohemian brethren of his day. Beyond his own time, his influence can be seen in the Moravians (&quot;Unitas Fratrum&quot;), Unity of the Brethren (&quot;Jednota Bratrská&quot;), and even the Baptist Union in the Czech Republic (also known as the &quot;Unity of Brethren Baptists&quot;). Important similarities can be seen between his teachings and the Continental Anabaptists, and, to a lesser extent, the English Baptists, though no direct connections have been shown to exist. He emphasized the New Testament as the exclusive and final source to know the will of God. He held two sacraments: baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. He encouraged people to read and interpret the Bible for themselves.

Chelčický&#x27;s work, specifically &quot;The Net of Faith&quot;, influenced Leo Tolstoy and is referenced in his book &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;. His name appears as Helchitsky in many English translations (following the Russian transliteration &quot;Хельчицкий&quot;).

<text>HotJava (later called HotJava Browser to distinguish it from HotJava Views) was a modular, extensible web browser from Sun Microsystems implemented in Java. It was the first browser to support Java applets, and was Sun&#x27;s demonstration platform for the then-new technology. It has since been discontinued and is no longer supported. Furthermore, the Sun Download Center was taken down on July 31, 2011, and the download link on the official site points to a placeholder page saying so.

==Origins==
In 1994, a team of Oak/Java developers started writing WebRunner, which was a clone of the web browser Mosaic. It was based on the Java programming language. The name ‘WebRunner’ was a tribute to the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; movie. The official Java name was adopted a year later in 1995 when Sun decided to make Oak public and integrate it with the web. 

WebRunner&#x27;s first public demonstration was given by John Gage and James Gosling at the Technology Entertainment Design Conference in Monterey, California in 1995. Renamed HotJava, it was officially announced in May the same year at the SunWorld conference.

The parser code was reused by the standard Java libraries.

==Usage==
HotJava had somewhat limited functionality compared to other browsers of its time.

More critically, HotJava suffered from the inherent performance limitations of Java virtual machine implementations of the day (both in terms of processing speed and memory consumption) and hence was considerably sluggish.

<doc id="447460" wikidata="Q163753" url="?curid=447460" title="Flag of Myanmar">
<text>The State Flag of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar was adopted on 21 October 2010.

== Current flag since 2010 ==
The State Flag described in the 2008 Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar was adopted by enacting the 2010 Union Flag Law and the abolishment of the 1974 State Flag Law on 21 October 2010. It was hoisted for the first time at 3:00 p.m. local time on 21 October 2010. Orders were also handed out to ensure all old national flags were burned.

Unlike the previous 1974 State Flag Law, the 2010 Union Flag Law includes the definition of the flag. The current flag is a horizontal tricolour flag of yellow, green, and red charged with a five-pointed white star in the centre of the field. The background is a yellow, green, and red tricolor, meant to honour the tricolours used during the independence struggle. The yellow represents unity, conformity, wisdom, happiness, and unity of all national races amicably. The green symbolises fertility, conformity,
fairness, and being a peaceful, pleasant, and green nation. The red represents bravery and decisiveness. The white star stands for purity, honesty,
fullness of compassion, and power.


== Obsolete flags (1948–2010) ==
The two flags used by the country immediately before the 2010 flag both originated in the Burmese Resistance, which adopted a red flag with a white star when fighting the occupying Japanese forces during World War II.

=== 1948 flag ===

The National Flag of the Union of Burma was designed by Maung Win and adopted by the Constituent Assembly of the Union of Burma in August 1947. It was hoisted for the first time at 4:25 AM on 4 January 1948 when Burma gained its independence from the United Kingdom. The flag consisted of a red field defaced with a blue canton. The blue canton was charged with one large white star surrounded by five smaller stars between its rays. The big white star in the canton and the red field honour the Resistance Flag and indicate the anti-fascist struggle. The four small white stars between the rays of the big white star symbolize the unity of various ethnicities of the republican union founded as a result of the resistance. The red represents courage, determination and unity. The blue canton means the nature of the sky, having deep meanings, the fresh and clear mind, and the light emitted in the night sky. The usage of stars is for the nature of the stars: never stopping, never cancelling the chosen path, always moving forward, being a guide for travellers, and existing since the beginning of the world indicating that Burma is with its rightful glory as an independent republic on the earth, while the colour white represents purity, righteousness and steadfastness. This flag has a ratio of 5:9 in which the canton has a ratio of 2:4. On 3 January 1974, it was replaced by the State Flag of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma.

=== 1974 flag ===
The State Flag adopted on 3 January 1974 upon the coming into force of the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma has a similar ratio and background colours as the previous flag but with different charge in the canton. The colour representations are also different: white is for purity and virtue, red for bravery and decisiveness, blue for peacefulness and steadfastness. It depicts 14 equal-sized white stars encircling a pinion with 14 cogs and ear of paddy with 34 grains superimposed on it (each star on each cog of the pinion) in a blue canton against a red field. The paddy represents peasants while the pinion represents workers; the combination symbolizes the peasants and workers as the foundation social classes for building the State. The 14 equal-sized white stars represent the equality and unity of the 14 members (7 states and 7 divisions) of the Union.

The 14-star flag was hung upside down during the 8888 Uprising of 1988 by demonstrators as a sign of protest against the military government. Despite its association with the period of military rule under Ne Win and later the State Peace and Development Council, the 1974 flag is used by demonstrators in the 2021 Myanmar protests, alongside the 1948 flag.

== Vertical style ==
=== Current flag ===
When hanging or depicting vertically, the yellow must be on left and the star must point to left. &lt;br&gt;
=== Obsolete flags ===
==== 1948 flag ====
When hanging or depicting vertically, the blue canton must be in the upper hoist, and the stars in the canton must point to the left.

== Influence of pre-independence flags ==
=== The Tricolours ===
In 1930, the Dobama Asiayone adopted a tricolour (, ) of yellow, green and red. In 1935, a peacock was added in the centre of the tricolour. In 1938, the leftists from Dobama Asiayone replaced the peacock with a hammer and sickle. Both of the tricolours were widely used by anti-colonialists during British rule. The peacock flag was also used by the Burma Independence Army and the State of Burma adopted it as the national flag from 1943 to 1945. In 1943, a stylized version of the peacock was introduced. This version was used by the Burma Defense Army (with the peacock in red) and as a variant of the national flag by the State of Burma (with the peacock in gold). There are two songs with the same name, &quot;&quot; (meaning: &quot;Tricolour Song&quot;), composed by two different composers about the meaning behind the Tricolour symbolism and the hope of Burmese people.

In these tricolours, the color yellow symbolizes the Sasana (Buddhism) and education, green represents staple grains, crops, minerals and jewelry, red signifies bravery or courage, and the peacock represents the Konbaung. The hammer and sickle represent workers and peasants, respectively.

===The Resistance Flag===

In 1945, when the Burma National Army changed sides and fought together with local resistance forces against the Japanese. A new flag, with a red field charged with a white star in the upper hoist, was adopted as the &quot;Resistance Flag.&quot;

=== Influences ===
The tricolours and the resistance flag have been depicted as &quot;national flags&quot; together with the pre-colonial and post-independence national flags. The resistance flag is alluded to and honoured by the 1948–1974 flag, while all the tricolours are referred and honoured by the current flag.

== Proposals ==

=== 1947 proposals ===
In 1947, the Constituent Assembly of the Union of Burma formed a preparatory committee for State flag, State seal and State anthem. That committee held a flag design contest, and the flag designed by Maung Win won the first prize. There was a dispute at the committee&#x27;s meeting in August 1947 whether or not the peacock should be added further to the proposed State flag; but after long discussions, the committee decided that the peacock should be rejected.

=== 2006–2007 proposals ===
A new design for the national flag was proposed on 10 November 2006 during a constitutional convention. The new flag would have consisted of three equally sized green, yellow, and red horizontal stripes, with a white star in the hoist end of the green stripe.

In September 2007, another new design was proposed with a larger white star in the middle and with the stripes in a different order, namely: yellow, green, and red. The proposal was a version of Burmese Tricolour with the white star.

The flag proposed in September 2007 was included in the new constitution, and was accepted with the 2008 referendum.

=== Former 2019 proposals ===
Two years before the 2021 coup, the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) proposed a series of constitutional amendments in July 2019, including one to change the national flag. Four political parties, the NLD, SNLD, ZCD and NUP proposed four new designs for the flag. The NLD proposed changing the national flag as they do not believe that the flag adopted in 2010 has the full support of the people of Myanmar. Their proposed flag was based on the flag adopted by the country at independence and consisted of a red field with a blue canton in the upper hoist. Within the blue canton is a large white star representing the union which is surrounded by 14 smaller white stars representing the states and regions of the country.

<text>A Desk and bench can be an antique or a modern form of desk combined with a small bench or a stool made in exactly the same style and material. The desk is usually not very big and meant to be placed against a wall, in a little room or a hallway. Because of this intended venue and its small size it is in a sense a cousin to the telephone desk. In form it is in general a smaller brother of the writing table.

The term &quot;Desk and bench&quot; is also sometimes used to describe a school desk which has a built-in seat. A &quot;Desk and bench&quot; set is also sometimes called a &quot;Desk and stool&quot;.

The desk is usually built with a single drawer or none, and the bench can sometimes have a small storage space under its seat. Great attention is usually paid to the aesthetics of the set in order to enhance the matching features.

Since the stool or bench has no back it is put away completely under the desk when not in use, maximizing even more the available space.

<doc id="447469" wikidata="Q165872" url="?curid=447469" title="Flag of Brunei">
<text>The national flag of Brunei holds deep historical and symbolic significance, reflecting the nation&#x27;s royal heritage and unity. First introduced in 1906 when Brunei became a British protectorate, the flag originally featured the now-familiar yellow, white, and black design, representing solidarity among the agreement&#x27;s signatories. The red national emblem, symbolising government support and unity, was added following the proclamation of the constitution in 1959. The flag’s design incorporates traditional Southeast Asian royal colours, with yellow symbolising the monarchy, white and black representing the purity and strength of Brunei’s wazirs, and red symbolising bravery and unity. Today, the flag stands as a powerful emblem of Brunei&#x27;s Islamic faith, royal authority, and enduring national identity.

==History==
With the exception of the symbol, Brunei&#x27;s current national flag design has been in use since 1906, when the country became a British protectorate under an agreement with the government of the United Kingdom. After the constitution was proclaimed on 29 September 1959, the national emblem was added. Prior to 1906, the sultan and other high-ranking officials, such as wazirs, used their personal standards as Brunei&#x27;s only flag. The yellow, white, and black colors of the national flag represented the signatories&#x27; solidarity in the 1906 pact. Only some people, such as the descendants of sultans and wazirs, were permitted to keep their own banners after 1959 in an effort to decrease the number of flags flown during state occasions.

== Design and symbolism ==
Brunei&#x27;s national flag is a rectangle design that is wide and 72 inches long. A diagonal parallelogram that runs from 2.5 inches below the top left corner to 2.5 inches above the bottom right corner, forming two distinct upper and lower sections, divides it into four sections. This diagonal is further divided into two uneven bands, with the upper white band measuring 7.5 inches wide and being one inch broader than the lower black band.

The red national emblem, with uplifted hands signifying unity and support for the government, sits in the center of the flag. The symbol is 24 inches from the left and right edges, which is the same distance from either side. The national motto, &quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;Always Render Service with God&#x27;s Guidance&quot;), is inscribed in yellow Arabic calligraphy.

The flag incorporates four colours:

* Yellow for the background, symbolising the monarchy.
* White for the upper diagonal, representing the wazirs&#x27; purity.
* Black for the lower diagonal, indicating strength and determination.
* Red for the emblem, symbolising bravery and unity.

In Southeast Asia, yellow is traditionally the colour of royalty, and the royal standards of Malaysia and Thailand, and the flag of Sarawak, along with the presidential flag of Indonesia, all use a yellow field as well. The crescent symbolises Islam, the parasol symbolises monarchy, and the hands at the side symbolise the benevolence of the government. The black and white stripes represent Brunei&#x27;s wazirs who were once joint-regents and then – after the sultan came of age – senior advisors: the &quot;Pengiran Bendahara&quot; (First Minister, symbolised by a slightly thicker white stripe) and the &quot;Pengiran Pemancha&quot; (Second Minister, governing foreign affairs, symbolised by black), with the white stripe being roughly 12% wider than the black one.

<doc id="447470" wikidata="Q622383" url="?curid=447470" title="Lincoln–Douglas debate format">
<text>Lincoln–Douglas debate (commonly abbreviated as LD Debate, or simply LD) is a type of one-on-one competitive debate practiced mainly in the United States at the high school level. It is sometimes also called values debate because the format traditionally places a heavy emphasis on logic, ethical values, and philosophy.
The Lincoln–Douglas debate format is named for the 1858 Lincoln–Douglas debates between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas, because their debates focused on slavery and the morals, values, and logic behind it. LD debates are used by the National Speech and Debate Association (NSDA) competitions, and also widely used in related debate leagues such as the National Christian Forensics and Communication Association, the National Catholic Forensic League, the National Educational Debate Association, the Texas University Interscholastic League, Texas Forensic Association, Stoa USA and their affiliated regional organizations.

Teams in a debate competition are given a resolution (a statement). In the competition, one side (called the a&quot;ffirmative)&quot; must support the resolution, and the other side (called the &quot;negative)&quot; must show that the action does not conform to the principle or that the affirmative has not shown how it does so (there are different schools of thought as to the negative&#x27;s burden).

The vast majority of tournaments use the resolutions distributed by the NSDA, which is changed once every two months.

The debate format is known for spreading, a practice in which debaters speak quickly to squeeze as much argument as possible into a short time limit. The resulting speech sounds like a cattle auctioneer.

== Format ==
The following is the basic debate format. Each side has 4 minutes of preparation time they can distribute among the two prep time periods assigned to them.
Each debater gets thirteen minutes of total speaking time, and three minutes of question time. The rounds take approximately 45 minutes in total. Each debater receives four to five minutes of preparation time to use between speeches however they like. While the amount of prep time is at the tournament&#x27;s discretion, the NSDA advocated three minutes until midway through the 2006–2007 season, when it decided on four. Some tournaments, most notably the TOC, choose to give debaters 5 minutes. Some tournaments also allow the use of flex prep, which melds the cross-examination time and prep time together to create a 6-8 minute block that can be used for questions and/or prep. Asking cross-examination questions during prep time is generally accepted on the national circuit. Most speeches start with an order often called an &quot;offtime roadmap&quot; because it&#x27;s given before the speech starts. The roadmap states which order the arguments and flows will be addressed in before the time starts (i.e. &quot;The order will be Topicality, K, CP, DA, then case.&quot;).

== Traditional case structures ==
Cases are logical syllogisms that attempt to prove the resolution morally obligatory (affirmative) or morally prohibited (negative). The typical (though not mandated) case is divided into a criterium, which outlines the conditions for discussing the resolution, and contentions, which are the arguments. The most essential part of the criterium is the value consideration, which is composed of a value (often called the value premise) that the case attempts to demonstrate the resolution action achieves/is in accordance with, and a value criterion. The value criterion is a way to attain, achieve and quantify the nebulous value. In most modern NSDA resolutions, a value is often stated in the resolution. For example, &quot;Resolved: Just governments ought to ensure food security for citizens.&quot; Because Justice is used in the resolution, it is an appealing value for many debaters. Morals is a common value due to its inclusion in many resolutions, followed by justice, social welfare, or other values depending on the topic. The criterium also may contain definitions for purposes of clarity and/or excluding certain lines of argumentation, and preemptions/&quot;spikes&quot; that attempt to preclude certain arguments that one&#x27;s opponent should not attempt. A narrow definition can be a spike. The contentions, of which a case must have at least one, links the resolution to the value. A proper contention necessarily has a claim, which summarizes the argument, at least one warrant, which is a reason the claim is true, and an impact, which explains the importance of the argument—or specifically why the argument meets the value criterium. In addition, contentions often include sub-points.

For example, a negative case for the resolution &quot;Resolved: A just society ought not use the death penalty as a form of punishment&quot; could have a value of justice, a value criterion of deterring crime, and then evidence-supported contentions that demonstrate that the death penalty uniquely fails as a deterrent. An affirmative case could have a value of justice, a criterion of respecting human life, and contentions giving evidence based arguments that all methods of execution are inhumane. The debaters would then argue whether crime deterrence or adherence to the principle of essentialist humanity is more effective at encouraging justice based on the evidence in their cases.

== Alternative case structures (Used in Progressive Debate) ==

=== Plans and counterplans ===

Lincoln–Douglas debate format borrows from Policy format debate in order to create plans and counter-plans. A counterplan (also called a CP) allows the negative side to defend an advocacy separate from the status quo. A counterplan must:

* Compete with the affirmative&#x27;s advocacy. The affirmative can disprove this quality of competition using a variety of &quot;perms,&quot; short for permutation, which describes the possibility of some sort of combination or permutation of the affirmative&#x27;s and the negative&#x27;s advocacy. A few types of perms include perm-do-both (in which the affirmative attempts to prove that the counterplan and the plan are not mutually exclusive and can co-exist, which means the counterplan no longer disproves the affirmative), perm-do-the-counterplan (in which the affirmative attempts to prove that the counterplan &quot;is&quot; the plan, based on how the counterplan or the plan function), timeframe-perm (in which the affirmative attempts to prove that the counterplan can exist in a world after the plan), and textual-based perms (a variety of perms in which the affirmative claims a lack of competition via the specific text of the plan and counterplan).
* Offer a net-benefit to the affirmative. The affirmative can disprove that the counterplan offers a net-benefit by claiming that the plan solves for the net-benefit, that the counterplan does not, or that the net-benefit is not significant.
* Solve either the entirety of or a sufficient amount of the impacts that the affirmative&#x27;s advocacy solves. If the counterplan does not do either, then the affirmative can simply claim that the counterplan is not as good as the plan.

There are various ways that an affirmative could defeat a counterplan, usually described in the acronym &quot;SPLOT,&quot; which stands for &quot;Solvency deficits, Perms, Links to the net benefit, Offense, Theory.&quot; Solvency deficits and perms explained above, &quot;links to the net benefit&quot; simply means that the counterplan leads to the reason that it claims is better than the plan, refutation is independent reason(s) why the counterplan is bad, and theory is explanations of comprehending the value of the debate.

=== Kritiks ===

Although the kritik (Sometimes called a K) originated in policy debate, its use in Lincoln–Douglas debate is becoming increasingly accepted as a legitimate argument in some debate districts and states. A kritik seeks to challenge an underlying mindset, usually from the perspective of critical theory. There are a few different types of kritiks. The resolutional kritik argues that a fundamental assumption of the resolution is flawed or offensive and thus it can&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t be debated or proven true. For example, in the January–February 2014 topic, &quot;Resolved: Developing countries should prioritize environmental protection over resource extraction when the two are in conflict,&quot; a kritik of the resolution would be that the resolution uses the words &quot;resource extraction&quot;, opening itself to an anthropocentrism kritik by assuming the world to be a resource for human use and degrading the moral character of nature. This kritik would further argue that an anthropocentric mindset would justify major harms, which, in order to avoid, would require the win go to the side presenting the criticism. The discourse kritik argues that the effects of an action one&#x27;s opponent has taken during or in relation to the round should outweigh consideration of the resolution. An example of a common discourse kritik is a gendered language kritik, which could be used if an opponent&#x27;s case has been written exclusively containing the male pronoun. Another example is if the opponent uses a slur (such as a derogatory term for homosexuals) in or out of the round, which opens the way to a &quot;bad discourse&quot; kritik.

A kritik is generally composed of four parts: the role of the ballot, link, impact, and alternative. In order to make a criticism, there has to be a link, or reason. A link can be a certain phrase in the resolution, something the opponent said, something conceded in cross-examination, etc. The link opens the gate to the criticism. Now that the link to the mindset being criticized has been established, there has to be a significant harm linked to that mindset, or impact. For example, if an opponent links in to statism, a harm or impact of this would be that statism justifies nuclear war or rights violations. An impact explains why the mindset is bad. In general, the alternative provides solvency for the harms proposed. Most alternatives look something like, &quot;reject the negative,&quot; &quot;reject statism,&quot; or something along those lines. The role of the ballot functions as framework for the kritik. A role of the ballot explains how the judge should view the debate round. If a kritik criticizes the ethics of the round, then an acceptable alternative would propose another type of ethic that should be used for reasons like better discourse.

===Theory shells===

A theory shell proposes rules to follow in a debate. The negative can do this by criticizing something the affirmative does that does not follow their vision of the debate. Shells include arguments such as that of disclosure theory and have become increasing popular in the high school circuits. A theory shell consists of four parts: the interpretation, violation, standards and the voters. A theory shell most often uses fairness and education to weigh the round, but many other standards and values are used when debating on them.

=== Plans ===

Sometimes, the affirmative advocates for a plan, which is a certain specified action which falls under the resolution. For example, with the January/February 2015 Topic (Resolved: Just governments ought to require that employers pay a living wage) a plan could have been to bring the Asia Floor Wage to a living wage level. These arguments are often countered by theory (see below) or . Plans originated from policy debate. Despite the growing popularity of affirmative plans, they are unacceptable in certain debate districts. In some states, the ballots used by judges instruct them to disregard affirmative plans. The only type of case that is virtually universally accepted is the value/value criterion/contention structure, and even that has its detractors.

Recently, methods of winning the round have become prominent that cannot be classified as true cases, because they are used as a semi-independent part of or in addition to the case proper, and do not advocate an extensively developed position. These include the &quot;a priori&quot; or &quot;prima facie&quot; argument which attempt to demonstrate that the resolution is true/false outside of the typical syllogistic model, most commonly by collapsing it into a tautology or presenting some reason why it&#x27;s nonsensical. &quot;Theory&quot; debate, which says that an opponent&#x27;s argument or style of argumentation (e.g. talking too fast or interpreting the resolution in a certain way) is unfair or noneducational and explains why fairness or educational considerations supersedes the resolutional evaluation, has also proliferated. Like atypical cases, the merit of these types of arguments is heatedly contested, although both are common on the national circuit.

== Judging ==
Judges fall under many categories, the most common of which are:
* Lay judge (a judge who does not have experience in debate of any form, and is partial to basic and/or slow arguments); usually parents tend to be lay judges
* Flow judge (a judge who seeks to minimize intervention in the round by judging based solely on the arguments as made by the debaters in the round. Arguments are usually tracked in a short-hand called &quot;the flow&quot;.)
* Classical/traditional judge (looks strongly on the ethics of the case and the philosophy that is behind it, especially when it comes to the Value structure. They will not look highly upon spreading (which is the debate term for speed reading, at rates of 300 or more words per minute, during speeches) or progressive debate tactics like counterplan and kritik).
* Policy judges look at all forms of arguments including those that come from policy debate; policy judges tend to be flow judges.

Experienced and qualified students are usually allowed to judge in the novice division. There are usually four or five elimination rounds in which the participators are marked by speaker points (0-30 is the speaker point range, however debaters are rarely assigned beneath a 26 and some states utilize a different points system—out of 40, for instance, in Idaho) and by a win or loss. Comments tend to be given by the judge to the debaters at the conclusion of the round. Comments are also written on the ballot, which is the document that the judge writes their decision on, as well as the speaker points awarded to each debater. Judges are often told before the tournament whether or not they are allowed to disclose to the participators, who won the round immediately following the decision (speaker points are never disclosed). However, that being said, some judges will never disclose and others will regardless of what the instructions were.

In some regional or national circuit tournaments with multiple divisions, less experienced judges are most commonly placed in the Novice division, while the Junior Varsity and Varsity divisions enjoy more experienced judges. Judges are assigned to a specific division based on their experience and some other criteria, and are only eligible to judge debaters within that division (a judge assigned to judge novices cannot judge varsity). This is known as a pool; each division has its own pool of judges. At most national circuit tournaments, the judges within the varsity pool are often ranked beforehand from 1 to 5 by the debaters and their coaches as part of &quot;mutual judge preferences&quot; (MJP). A 1 is the best possible ranking, a 5 is a judge with a conflict of interest regarding the debater, and a 6 is a &quot;strike&quot;, who may never judge the debater, teams are usually allowed 4-5 &quot;strikes&quot; per tournament. During the tournament, the tabulation staff will attempt to give each round a mutual judge (i.e. a judge who is a 1 for both sides). Different debaters &quot;pref&quot; different judges depending on their past experiences and debating styles. The most preferred judges are usually former debaters who are now college students serving as assistant coaches, as they know the modern norms of debate well.

Other regional circuits more heavily emphasize the rhetorical skills required in front of inexperienced judges, and recruit &quot;lay&quot; judges from the community. These judges are typically concerned citizens or parents of debaters from the school hosting the tournament or a participating school. Some circuits require all LD judges for rounds above the novice level to meet training requirements. Another option is to use lay judges for the rounds, but offer them a brief training session or tutorial beforehand to prepare and inform them about the nature of the debate. Nevertheless, lay judges tend to incline more towards the side they personally prefer.

== Tournament organization ==

Many tournaments offer two or three divisions of competition in LD: novice, junior varsity, and varsity. Novice is exclusively for new debaters in their first year of competition, junior varsity is for talented novices or debaters in their second year of competition, and varsity is for experienced debaters.

A typical one-day tournament holds three or four rounds. Each debater advocates each side an equal number of times or one side once more than the other, depending on whether the number of rounds is even or odd. Multi-day tournaments have five to eight preliminary rounds in which all debaters participate. The debaters with the best win–loss record from this set of rounds then advance (called &quot;breaking&quot; or &quot;clearing&quot;) to a single-elimination stage of &quot;outrounds&quot; that determines the eventual champion. All debaters present have the hypothetical potential to &quot;hit&quot;, or square off against, any other competitor in their field at the tournament, though if at all possible debaters are prohibited from hitting members of their own team and hitting someone they have previously hit earlier at the same tournament again. Similarly, judges who have already judged a debater are not supposed to judge them again in preliminaries. In contrast, a tournament in which each competitor must debate every other competitor is called a &quot;round robin&quot;. These tend to be very small, and specific participants are invited to attend.

Most LD tournaments are &quot;power matched&quot; (also called &quot;power paired&quot; or just &quot;powered&quot;). In this system, after the first two rounds (often referred to as presets, as they are randomly paired beforehand), the pairings for the third round are decided on the basis that people with the same record (known as being in the same bracket) debate. For example, a 2‑0 would hit another 2‑0, a 1‑1 would hit another 1‑1, etc. Speaker points determine who hits who within each bracket (the 2‑0 with the highest speaks of any 2‑0 would hit the 2‑0 with the lowest speaks, second-highest hits second-lowest, etc.) After the third round, the debaters&#x27; cumulative records and speaks (rather than the results of their last round) place them in their brackets. Local tournaments sometimes use randomized brackets throughout their whole duration. Other tournaments use a &quot;power protected&quot; system during prelim rounds, in which a 3-0 would hit an 0-3 and a 2-1 would hit a 1-2. In &quot;elimination rounds&quot; after the primary four to six (or even eight) preliminary rounds, the top &quot;seed&quot; will &quot;hit&quot; the lowest &quot;seed&quot;. Seeding is determined first by preliminary round records and then by the number of speaker points awarded by judges in preliminary rounds, with various tiebreakers (total number of opponent wins, speaker points after the highest and lowest given to each debater have been subtracted, judge variance, randomly assigned number, etc.) that follow should the statistics remain even.

== Tournament competition ==
Most high school debaters participate in local tournaments in their city or school district, and travel to other areas of the state occasionally. Hundreds of such tournaments are held each weekend at high schools throughout the United States during the debate season.

A relatively small subset (perhaps a few hundred) of high school debaters, mostly from elite public and private schools, travel around the country to tournaments on the &quot;national circuit&quot;. The current nine largest and most prestigious/competitive national circuit tournaments are (in no particular order) the Glenbrooks, held at Glenbrook North and Glenbrook South High Schools in the Chicago suburbs; the New York City Invitational at the Bronx High School of Science; the Harvard Invitational at Harvard University in Boston, Mass; the California Invitational at UC Berkeley, the Greenhill Fall Classic hosted by Greenhill School in Addison, Texas; the Heart of Texas Invitational at St. Mark&#x27;s School in Dallas, Texas; The Harvard-Westlake Debates, held at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles; the Mid-America Cup at Valley High School in West Des Moines, Iowa; and the Minneapple at Apple Valley High School in Minnesota. There are a few other prestigious national tournaments that cap the number of debaters from each school and total number of schools allowed to enter to preserve competitive integrity, and because there might simply be not enough space available. National circuit tournaments are very large events that typically draw 120-200 varsity LD competitors, in addition to LDers in the novice and jv divisions, policy debaters, public forum debaters, speech participants, judges, coaches, etc. Some of the biggest attract near a thousand total participants. Regionally significant tournaments often also draw over a hundred participants. National circuit debate is generally characterized by its extremely fast manner of speaking (300 wpm is not considered an uncommon speed to read a case at), use of jargon, and emphasis on strength/depth of argumentation rather than rhetoric. However, some debaters have been successful on the national circuit without conforming to these conventions. The national circuit is mostly composed of traditional &quot;power schools&quot; with historically strong programs (e.g. Valley High School in Iowa, Lexington High School in Massachusetts, Scarsdale High School in New York, Greenhill School in Texas, Strake Jesuit College Preparatory also in Texas, or Walt Whitman High School in Maryland). The national circuit and its accompanying style of debate are sometimes criticized for being exclusionary. In particular, critics argue that national circuit &quot;power&quot; programs encourage jargon and esoteric norms not as a means of improving discourse, but as a means of deterring competition from the uninitiated.

As the debate season comes to a close, national championship tournaments (collectively referred to as the postseason) are held to bring together the best debaters from around the nation to compete against one another. These tournaments require reaching certain levels of success at a qualifying tournaments throughout the season.

The unofficial national circuit championship is the Tournament of Champions (LD) (TOC) held at the University of Kentucky. To be eligible for the TOC, debaters must collect at least two bids at various designated tournaments held throughout the year. (They cannot be considered qualifying tournaments because they technically exist independent of TOC authority and are significant in their own right.) These tournaments are granted a certain number of bids by the director of the TOC (Prof. Angela Reed) with the input of her advisory committee that debaters receive upon reaching a certain level in the elimination rounds. The level of elimination round at which bids are awarded is subjective, but depends chiefly on the size of the tournament, the perceived collective quality of the debaters in attendance, and the quality of the tournament itself (whether it is run well or not). There are fluctuations in tournaments&#x27; bid levels and the tournaments that have bids in the first place, but the major tournaments have very secure bids. For example, the Dowling Catholic Paradigm held at Dowling Catholic High School in West Des Moines, Iowa is a medium-sized tournament attended by debaters of all experience levels mostly from the Midwest, and therefore receives four bids, awarded to the debaters who reach the semifinal round of the tournament. The Glenbrooks tournament, considered among the most competitive regular season tournaments in the country, is attended by approximately 200 experienced debaters and has for many years had 16 bids to hand out to competitors who reach the octofinal round.

For non-national circuit debaters, either the National Speech and Debate Tournament of the National Forensic League or the Grand National Tournament of the National Catholic Forensic League is the national tournament of their sponsoring organization. Competitors qualify to these national tournaments by placing in the top spots at district-level tournaments held specifically as qualifiers. The number of competitors in each district determines the number of competitors that will qualify to the national tournament. Most NSDA districts have two to four, but some NCFL districts have six.

== Rankings ==
There have been several attempts in the past to create a cohesive national ranking system. One was Fantasy Debate, which ran from 2010 to 2012 but is now closed. Other defunct ranking systems include the Briefly ELO rankings, which aren&#x27;t actively acknowledged or updated any longer.

The National Speech &amp; Debate Association provides a ranking of inputted points gained throughout events, with the option of filtering out points solely earned in Lincoln-Douglas debate.

There is also a system of points for Lincoln Douglas Debate known as the Dukes and Bailey cup, which takes your top 5 tournaments of the year, and assigns a point value to them.

== Resolutions ==
NSDA resolutions (topics to be debated) change every two months. They always propose that a specific policy or issue (the &quot;resolutional policy/action&quot;) conforms to a certain principle (the &quot;value&quot;). The affirmative must uphold the resolution, and the negative must show that the action does not conform to the principle or that the affirmative has not shown how it does so (there are different schools of thought as to the negative&#x27;s burden).

Ten possible resolutions for the upcoming year are chosen by a wording committee and released at the NSDA National Tournament. Anybody can submit a resolution for consideration to the wording committee. Each coach in the country receives a ballot with a copy of the official magazine of the NSDA, the Rostrum, and votes for a topic for each two-month slot. Voting can also be done online. Until the 2007–2008 season each coach could only rank the topics on one list, with the one receiving the overall highest ranking becoming the National Tournament topic, the second highest becoming the March–April topic, the third highest Jan/Feb topic, etc. However, because of the prominence of the Jan-Feb slot (the TOC and several other tournaments not actually in January or February elect to use this topic, resulting in it being jokingly referred to as the &quot;six-month topic&quot;), coaches now select their three highest choices for each two-month slot.

The resolutions of the NCFL National Tournament, UIL (which includes LD debate as one of its academic contests), and NCFCA are selected independently of the NSDA resolutions.

It is believed that during the ashvamedha yajna by Rama, Lava and Kusha caught the ritual horse and tied Hanuman to a tree near to today&#x27;s Durgiana Temple.

==History==
===Founding of Amritsar city===

In the Sikh tradition, Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh guru, is credited with founding the holy city of Amritsar. Two versions of stories exist regarding the land where Guru Ram Das settled. In one, based on a &quot;Gazetteer&quot; record, the land was purchased, with Sikh donations, for 700 rupees from the owners of the village of Tung.

According to historical Sikh records, the site was chosen by Guru Amar Das and called Guru Da Chakk. The latter guru had asked Ram Das to find land to start a new town, and to create a man-made pool as its central point. After the coronation Guru Ram Das in 1574, who faced hostile opposition from the sons of Guru Amar Das, he founded the town; it was named after him as &quot;Ramdaspur&quot;. He first completed the pool, and built his new official Guru centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle into the new town with him. The town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan Dev, financed by donations and constructed by volunteers. town grew to become the city of Amritsar. After the son of Guru Amar Das built the gurdwara Harmandir Sahib, the pool area developed further as a temple complex. In 1604 Amar Das&#x27;s son installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new temple.

The period and achievements of construction between 1574 and 1604 are described in &quot;Mahima Prakash Vartak&quot;, a semi-historical Sikh hagiographic text likely composed in 1741. It is the earliest known document dealing with the lives of all the ten Gurus.
In 1762 and 1766–1767, Ahmad Shah of the Durrani Empire invaded the Sikh Confederacy. He besieged Amritsar, massacred the populace, and destroyed the city.

===Old walled city===

During the reign of the Sikh Empire, in 1822 Maharaja Ranjit Singh fortified the city, starting from a wall at Katra Maha Singh area.

Among the &quot;Katras&quot; (fortified residential societies) constructed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh within the city were the following:

* Katra Moti Ram
* Katra Kanwar Kharak Singh (also known as &#x27;Katra Nikkai&#x27;)
* Katra Fateh Singh Kallianwala
* Katra Ahluwalia

Later, Sher Singh continued with construction of the city wall, adding twelve gates. He also had built a fort named &quot;Dhoor Kot&quot;; its fortification were yards broad and 7 yards high. The circumference of the walled city was around five miles. The twelve gates constructed during this era were known as (including later renamings):

# Lahori Darwaza (Lahori Gate)
# Khazana Darwaja (Khazana Gate)
# Deori Hakiman (Gate Hakeema/Darwaza Hakeema Wala)
# Gilwali Darwaza – no longer extant
# Darwaza Rangar Nanglian (Gate Bhagatawala) – no longer extant
# Darwaza Ramgarhian (Chattiwind Gate) – later restored
# Darwaza Ahluwalia (Darwaza Gheo Mandi) – was no longer extant but has since been restored
# Doburji Darwaza (Sultanwind Gate or Delhi Darwaza)
# Deorhi Kalan
# Darwaza Rambagh
# Deorhi Shazada (Hathi Darwaza/Darwaza Sehzada)
# Darwaza Lohgarh – no longer extant

When the British annexed Punjab in 1849, Amritsar was a walled city. The British built a thirteenth gate in 1866 known as &quot;Hall Gate, Neighborhood in Amritsar, Punjab.&quot;

The British rulers would later demolish some of the walls and gates or reconstruct some. An entire new wall of the city was completed in 1885. Many surviving gates have since been renamed and no longer bear their mid-19th century names, while others have since been demolished.

===Jallianwala Bagh massacre===

The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, involving the killings of hundreds of Indian civilians on the orders of British Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer, took place on 13 April 1919 in the heart of Amritsar, the holiest city of the Sikhs, on a day sacred to them as the birth anniversary of the Khalsa (Vaisakhi day).

In Punjab, during World War I (1914–18), there was considerable social unrest, particularly among the Sikhs. First, they opposed the demolition of a boundary wall of Gurdwara Rakab Ganj, a historic gurdwara near Parliament House in New Delhi. Later, they were disturbed about the activities and trials of the Ghadarites, almost all of whom were Sikhs. In India as a whole, political activity had arisen during the strains of war. Two leaders had emerged: Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948), who after a period of struggle as a young man against the British in South Africa had returned to India in January 1915 to work there for change and Annie Besant (1847–1933), head of the Theosophical Society of India. On 11 April 1916 she established the Home Rule League with the goal of autonomy for India. In December 1916, the Indian National Congress, at its annual session held at Lucknow, passed a resolution asking the king to issue a proclamation announcing that it is the &quot;aim and intention of British policy to confer self-government on India at an early date&quot;.

On 10 April 1919, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, two popular proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi, were called to the deputy commissioner&#x27;s residence. There they were arrested and transported by car to Dharamsetla, a hill town, now in Himachal Pradesh. A general strike arose in response in Amritsar. Excited groups of citizens soon merged into a crowd of about 50,000 marching to protest these arrests to the deputy commissioner. The crowd, however, was stopped by British colonial forces and fired upon near the railway foot-bridge. The official version reported that the number of casualties were 12 dead and between 20 and 30 wounded. Based on evidence presented to an inquiry of the Indian National Congress, fatalities were reported as between 20 and 30.

Three days later, on 13 April, the traditional festival of Baisakhi, thousands of unarmed Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh. An hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 16:30, Dyer arrived with a group of sixty-five Gurkha soldiers (from the 9th Gorkha Rifles) and twenty-five Baluchi soldiers (from the 59th Scinde Rifles). Without warning the crowd to disperse, Dyer blocked the main exits from the Bagh and ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd; the firing continued for approximately ten minutes. A British government inquiry into the massacre placed the death toll at 379. The Indian National Congress, on the other hand, estimated that approximately 1,000 people were killed.

===Operation Blue Star===
Amritsar was a center of unrest in the late 20th century. In the 1980s, Sikh militants occupied the Golden Temple there. Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi, ordered Operation Blue Star (1 – 6 June 1984), an Indian military operation to remove the militants from the temple. The operation was carried out by Indian army troops equipped with tanks and armoured vehicles. While militarily successful, the operation aroused immense controversy. The government&#x27;s justification for the timing and style of the attack are hotly debated. &quot;India Today&quot; magazine has ranked Operation Blue Star as among the Top 10 Political Disgraces in India.

Official reports put the number of deaths among the Indian army at 83, with 493 civilians and Sikh militants killed. While independent estimates place the numbers upwards of 5,000 people, a majority of them pilgrims, including women and children. In addition, the CBI is considered responsible for seizing historical artefacts and manuscripts in the Sikh Reference Library before burning it down. Four months after the operation, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two of her Sikh bodyguards in what is viewed as an act of vengeance. Following her assassination, more than 17,000 Sikhs were killed in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

<text>The Emblem of Brunei is a national symbol that is also featured on the flag of Brunei. It was adopted in 1959. There are five main components to the national emblem: the flag, the royal parasol (ceremonial umbrella), the wings, the hands, and the crescent.

Below the crescent is a banner; both are inscribed with yellow lettering in Arabic:
* On the crescent, Brunei&#x27;s national motto: ; , meaning &quot;Always in service with God&#x27;s guidance&quot; (Malay: &quot;).
* On the banner (scroll), the state&#x27;s name: ; &quot;, literally &quot;Brunei, the Abode of Peace&quot;.

==Design==
All elements on the emblem are red. On some versions they have black outlines; others have colourless outlines.
# The small swallowtail flag and parasol (&quot;&quot;), regalia of the sultanate&#x27;s monarchy, have been the royal insignia since the creation of the emblem. 
# The wings symbolise protection of justice, tranquility, prosperity and peace.
# Below these is the crescent, a symbol of Islam, the state religion of Brunei.
# On the sides, the upturned hands indicate the government&#x27;s duty is to preserve and promote the welfare of the citizens and to protect the people.

== Personal emblem of the Sultan==
After the Constitution was enacted in 1959 the Sultan of Brunei adopted a different emblem from the emblem of state, in that the two hands were superseded by two golden &quot;sejant&quot; cats (&quot;kuching emas&quot;). At his coronation in 1968, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah used a crown (&quot;mahkota&quot;) with an original design due it is based on the brocade turbans used by previous sultans. It is made of precious metal, decorated with pendilia and a sarpech consisting of a crescent-and-ten-pointed star and topped with a seven-pointed ornament.

An excerpt from the Quran in Arabic text is inscribed upon the crescent, the opening verse of the &quot;surah&quot; &quot;Al-Mulk&quot;: ; &quot;Tabāraka al-ladhī bi-yadihi al-mulku&quot;, meaning &quot;Blessed is the One in Whose Hands rests all authority&quot;. 

Around 1999 a highly elaborate achievement was adopted. It maintained the inscribed crescent, since that time &quot;vert&quot;, and the winged umbrella as core elements but the Sultan&#x27;s crown was added over them. This set is surrounded by a garland of ears paddy &quot;or&quot; and is displayed the name of God (Allah) in &quot;chief&quot;. On the yellow standard of the Sultan, the emblem is all red.

<text>The Lincoln–Douglas debates were a series of seven debates in 1858 between Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party candidate for the United States Senate from Illinois, and incumbent Senator Stephen Douglas, the Democratic Party candidate. Until the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that senators shall be elected by the people of their states, was ratified in 1913, senators were elected by their respective state legislatures, so Lincoln and Douglas were trying to win the votes of the state legislature of the two chambers of the Illinois General Assembly meeting at the state capital town of Springfield for their respective political parties.

The debates were designed to generate publicity—some of the first examples of what in modern parlance would be characterized as &quot;media events&quot;. For Lincoln, they were an opportunity to raise both his state and national profile and that of the burgeoning Republican Party, newly organized four years before in Ripon, Wisconsin, in 1854. For Senator Douglas, they were an opportunity to defend his record—especially his role in promoting the doctrine of popular sovereignty in regard to the issue of American black slavery and its role in the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. The candidates spoke in each of Illinois&#x27;s nine congressional districts. They had already spoken in the state capital of Springfield and in the state&#x27;s largest city of Chicago within a day of each other, so they decided that their future joint appearances would be held in the remaining seven congressional districts. Since Douglas was the incumbent, he had very little to gain from these debates. However, Lincoln, only a one-term U.S. Representative (congressman) a decade before, was gaining support, having spoken the day after Douglas spoke in Chicago, and thus presenting a rejoinder Douglas could not answer back with a rebuttal. Each debate lasted about three hours; each candidate spoke for sixty minutes, followed by a ninety minute response and a final thirty minute rejoinder by the first candidate. As the incumbent, Douglas spoke first in four of the debates, thereafter alternating who spoke first at the remaining debates. They were held outdoors, weather permitting, from about 2 to 5 p.m.

The debates focused on slavery, specifically whether it would be allowed in the new states to be formed from the new American western federal territories acquired through the earlier Louisiana Purchase of 1803, and the more recent Mexican Cession of 1849. Douglas, as the Democratic candidate, held that the decision should be made by the residents of the new states themselves rather than by the federal government (popular sovereignty). Lincoln argued against the expansion of slavery, yet stressed that he was not advocating its abolition where it already existed. So, Lincoln is widely considered to have won the debates, as he gained more popular votes than Douglas.

Never in American history had there been widespread newspaper coverage of political debates. Both candidates felt they were speaking to the whole nation. New technology had become available in recent years: railroad networks, the electric telegraph with its Morse code, and Pitman shorthand writing, at that time called &quot;phonography&quot;. The state&#x27;s largest newspapers, based in Chicago, sent phonographers—now known as stenographers—to copy and report complete texts of each debate; thanks to the new railroads, the debates were not hard to reach from Chicago. Halfway through each debate and series of speeches, runners were handed the stenographers&#x27; notes. They raced to meet the next train to Chicago, handing the notes to railway riding stenographers who during the journey converted the shorthand symbols and abbreviations back into their original words, producing a transcript ready for the Chicago typesetters printing presses, and for the telegrapher, who sent the texts to the rest of the country east of the Rocky Mountains, which was as far as the telegraph wires reached. The next train would deliver the conclusion of the debate. The papers published the speeches in full, sometimes within hours of their delivery. Some newspapers helped their preferred candidate with minor corrections, reports on the audience&#x27;s positive reaction, or tendentious headlines (&quot;New and Powerful Argument by Mr. Lincoln–Douglas Tells the Same Old Story&quot;). The newswire of the Associated Press, then only a decade old, sent messages simultaneously to multiple points, enabling newspapers and magazines east of the Rockies to print the debates soon after they occurred, which led to the debates rapidly becoming nationally followed events. They were later republished as pamphlets.

The debates took place between August and October of 1858. Newspapers reported 12,000 in attendance in Ottawa (Illinois), 16,000 to 18,000 in Galesburg, 15,000 in Freeport,
12,000 in Quincy, and at the last debate in Alton, 5,000 to 10,000. The debates near Illinois&#x27;s borders (Freeport, Quincy, and Alton) drew large numbers of people from neighboring states. A number travelled within Illinois to follow the debates.

Douglas was re-elected by the Illinois General Assembly, 54–46. But the publicity made Lincoln a national figure and laid the groundwork for his 1860 presidential campaign.

As part of that endeavor, Lincoln edited the texts of all the debates and had them published in a book. It sold well and helped him receive the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination for president at the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago.

==Background==
Douglas was elected to the United States Senate in 1846, and he was seeking re-election for a third term in 1858. The issue of slavery was raised several times during his tenure in the Senate, particularly with respect to the Compromise of 1850. As chairman of the committee on U.S. territories, he argued for an approach to slavery called popular sovereignty: electorates in the territories would vote whether to adopt or reject slavery. Decisions previously had been made at the federal level concerning slavery in the territories. Douglas was successful with passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854. The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Lincoln and Friends Society&quot; notes that prominent Bloomington, Illinois resident Jesse W. Fell, a local real estate developer who founded the &quot;Bloomington Pantagraph&quot; and who befriended Lincoln in 1834, had suggested the debates in 1854.

Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1846, and he served a two-year term in the House of Representatives. During his tenure in the Congress, he disagreed with Douglas and supported the Wilmot Proviso, which sought to ban slavery in any new territory. He returned to politics in the 1850s to oppose the Kansas–Nebraska Act and to help develop the new Republican Party.

Before the debates, Lincoln charged that Douglas was encouraging fears of amalgamation of the races, with enough success to drive thousands of people away from the Republican Party. Douglas replied that Lincoln was an abolitionist for saying that the American Declaration of Independence applied to blacks as well as whites.

Lincoln argued in his House Divided Speech that Douglas was part of a conspiracy to nationalize slavery. Lincoln said that ending the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in Kansas and Nebraska was the first step in this nationalizing and that the Dred Scott decision was another step in the direction of spreading slavery into Northern territories. He expressed the fear that any similar Supreme Court decision would turn Illinois into a slave state.

Much has been written of Lincoln&#x27;s rhetorical style but, going into the debates, Douglas&#x27;s reputation was a daunting one. As James G. Blaine later wrote:

==The debates==
When Lincoln made the debates into a book, in 1860, he included the following material as preliminaries:
* Speech at Springfield by Lincoln, June 16, the &quot;Lincoln&#x27;s House Divided Speech&quot; speech (in the volume, the erroneous date June 17 is given)
* Speech at Chicago by Douglas, July 9
* Speech at Chicago by Lincoln, July 10
* Speech at Bloomington by Douglas, July 16
* Speech at Springfield by Douglas, July 17 (Lincoln was not present)
* Speech at Springfield by Lincoln, July 17 (Douglas was not present)
* Preliminary correspondence of Lincoln and Douglas, July 24–31

The debates were held in seven towns in the state of Illinois:
* Ottawa on August 21
* Freeport on August 27
* Jonesboro on September 15
* Charleston on September 18
* Galesburg on October 7
* Quincy on October 13
* Alton on October 15

Slavery was the main theme of the Lincoln–Douglas debates, particularly the issue of slavery&#x27;s expansion into the territories. Douglas&#x27;s Kansas–Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise&#x27;s ban on slavery in the territories of Kansas and Nebraska and replaced it with the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which meant that the people of a territory would vote as to whether to allow slavery. During the debates, both Lincoln and Douglas appealed to the &quot;Fathers&quot; (Founding Fathers) to bolster their cases.

===Ottawa===

Lincoln said at Ottawa:

Lincoln said in the first debate, in Ottawa, that popular sovereignty would nationalize and perpetuate slavery. Douglas replied that both Whigs and Democrats believed in popular sovereignty and that the Compromise of 1850 was an example of this. Lincoln said that the national policy was to limit the spread of slavery, and he mentioned the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 as an example of this policy, which banned slavery from a large part of the Midwest.

The Compromise of 1850 allowed the territories of Utah and New Mexico to decide for or against slavery, but it also allowed the admission of California as a free state, reduced the size of the slave state of Texas by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the District of Columbia. In return, the South got a stronger Fugitive Slave Law than the version mentioned in the Constitution. Douglas said that the Compromise of 1850 replaced the Missouri Compromise&#x27;s ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of the state of Missouri, while Lincoln said—a topic he went back to in the Jonesboro debate—that Douglas was mistaken in seeing &quot;Popular Sovereignty&quot; and the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision as being in harmony with the Compromise of 1850. To the contrary, &quot;Popular Sovereignty&quot; would nationalize slavery.

There were partisan remarks, such as Douglas&#x27;s accusations that members of the &quot;Black Republican&quot; party were abolitionists, including Lincoln, and he cited as proof Lincoln&#x27;s House Divided Speech, in which he said, &quot;I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.&quot; Douglas also charged Lincoln with opposing the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision because &quot;it deprives the negro of the rights and privileges of citizenship.&quot; Lincoln responded that &quot;the next Dred Scott decision&quot; could allow slavery to spread into free states. Douglas accused Lincoln of wanting to overthrow state laws that excluded Blacks from states such as Illinois, which were popular with the northern Democrats. Lincoln did not argue for complete social equality, but he did say that Douglas ignored the basic humanity of Blacks and that slaves did have an equal right to liberty, stating &quot;I agree with Judge Douglas he is not my equal in many respects—certainly not in color, perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment. But in the right to eat the bread, without the leave of anybody else, which his own hand earns, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas, and the equal of every living man.&quot;

Lincoln said that he did not know how emancipation should happen. He believed in colonization in Africa by emancipated slaves, but admitted that it was impractical. He said that it would be wrong for emancipated slaves to be treated as &quot;underlings&quot;, but that there was a large opposition to social and political equality and that &quot;a universal feeling, whether well or ill-founded, cannot be safely disregarded.&quot; He said that Douglas&#x27;s public indifference would result in the expansion of slavery because it would mold public sentiment to accept it. As Lincoln said, &quot;public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed. Consequently he who molds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed.&quot; He said that Douglas &quot;cares not whether slavery is voted down or voted up,&quot; and that he would &quot;blow out the moral lights around us&quot; and eradicate the love of liberty.

===Freeport===

At the debate at Freeport, Lincoln forced Douglas to choose between two options, either of which would damage Douglas&#x27;s popularity and chances of getting reelected. He asked Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision. Douglas responded that the people of a territory could keep slavery out even though the Supreme Court said that the federal government had no authority to exclude slavery, simply by refusing to pass a slave code and other legislation needed to protect slavery. Douglas alienated Southerners with this Freeport Doctrine, which damaged his chances of winning the presidency in 1860. As a result, Southern politicians used their demand for a slave code to drive a wedge between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic Party, splitting the majority political party in 1858.

Douglas failed to gain support in all sections of the country through popular sovereignty. By allowing slavery where the majority wanted it, he lost the support of Republicans led by Lincoln, who thought that Douglas was unprincipled. He lost the support of the South by rejecting the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and advocating a Freeport Doctrine to stop slavery in Kansas, where the majority were anti-slavery.

===Jonesboro===
In his address in Jonesboro, Lincoln said that the expansion of slavery would endanger the Union, and mentioned the controversies over slavery in Missouri in 1820, in the territories conquered from Mexico that led to the Compromise of 1850, and again with the Bleeding Kansas controversy. He said that the crisis would be reached and passed when slavery was put &quot;in the course of ultimate extinction.&quot;

===Charleston===
Before the debate at Charleston, Democrats held up a banner that read &quot;Negro equality&quot; with a picture of a white man, a negro woman, and a mulatto child.

Lincoln began his address by clarifying that his concerns about slavery did not equate to support for racial equality. He stated:
In his subsequent response, Stephen Douglas said that Lincoln had an ally in Frederick Douglass in preaching &quot;abolition doctrines.&quot; He said that Frederick Douglass told &quot;all the friends of negro equality and negro citizenship to rally as one man around Abraham Lincoln.&quot; He also charged Lincoln with a lack of consistency when speaking on the issue of racial equality (in the Charleston debate) and cited Lincoln&#x27;s previous statements that the declaration that all men are created equal applies to blacks as well as whites.

In response to Douglas&#x27;s questioning of Lincoln&#x27;s support of negro citizenship, if not full equality, Lincoln further clarified in his rejoinder: &quot;I tell him very frankly that I am not in favor of negro citizenship.&quot;

===Galesburg===
At Galesburg, using quotes from Lincoln&#x27;s Chicago address, Douglas sought again to prove that Lincoln was an abolitionist because of his insistence upon the principle that &quot;all men are equal&quot;.

===Quincy===
The debate in Quincy was held on October 13.

===Alton===
At Alton, Lincoln tried to reconcile his statements on equality. He said that the authors of the Declaration of Independence &quot;intended to include all men, but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects.&quot; As Lincoln said, &quot;They meant to set up a standard maxim for the free society which should be familiar to all,—constantly looked to, constantly labored for, and even, though never perfectly attained, constantly approximated, and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence, and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people, of all colors, everywhere.&quot; He contrasted his support for the Declaration with opposing statements made by John C. Calhoun and Senator John Pettit of Indiana, who called the Declaration &quot;a self-evident lie&quot;. Lincoln said that Chief Justice Roger Taney and Stephen Douglas were opposing Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s self-evident truth, dehumanizing blacks and preparing the public mind to think of them as only property. Lincoln thought that slavery had to be treated as a wrong and kept from growing.

As Lincoln said at Alton: These words were set to music by Aaron Copland in his &quot;Lincoln Portrait&quot;.

Lincoln used a number of colorful phrases in the debates. He said that one argument by Douglas made a horse chestnut into a chestnut horse, and he compared an evasion by Douglas to the sepia cloud from a cuttlefish. In Quincy, Lincoln said that Douglas&#x27;s Freeport Doctrine was do-nothing sovereignty that was &quot;as thin as the homeopathic soup that was made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death.&quot;

==The role of technology==
Recent improvements in technology were fundamental to the debates&#x27; success and popularity. New railroads connected major cities at high speeds—a message that on a horse would have taken a week arrived in hours. A forgotten &quot;soft&quot; technology, Pitman shorthand, allowed writing to keep up with speech, far closer to a recording than had been possible before. Finally, messages could now be sent via the electrical telegraph, anywhere east of the Rocky Mountains. &quot;The combination of shorthand, the telegraph and the railroad changed everything,&quot; wrote Allen C. Guelzo, author of &quot;Lincoln and Douglas: The Debates That Defined America&quot;. &quot;It was unprecedented. Lincoln and Douglas knew they were speaking to the whole nation. It was like JFK in 1960 coming to grips with the presence of the vast new television audience.&quot;

==Results==

The October surprise of the election was former Whig John J. Crittenden&#x27;s endorsement of Douglas. Non-Republican former Whigs comprised the biggest block of swing voters, and Crittenden&#x27;s endorsement of Douglas rather than Lincoln reduced Lincoln&#x27;s chances of winning.

The districts were drawn to favor Douglas&#x27;s party, and the Democrats won 40 seats in the state House of Representatives while the Republicans won 35. In the State Senate, Republicans held 11 seats and Democrats held 14. Douglas was re-elected by the legislature 54–46, even though Republican candidates for the state legislature together received 24,094 more votes than candidates supporting Douglas. However, the widespread media coverage of the debates greatly raised Lincoln&#x27;s national profile, making him a viable candidate for nomination as the Republican candidate in the upcoming 1860 presidential election.

Ohio Republican committee chairman George Parsons put Lincoln in touch with Ohio&#x27;s main political publisher, Follett and Foster, in Columbus, Ohio It published copies of the text in &quot;Political Debates Between Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas in the Celebrated Campaign of 1858, in Illinois.&quot; Four printings were made, and the fourth sold 16,000 copies.

==Commemoration==

The debate locations in Illinois feature plaques and statuary of Douglas and Lincoln.

There is a Lincoln–Douglas Debate Museum in Charleston.

In 1994, C-SPAN aired a series of re-enactments of the debates filmed on location.

In 2008, BBC Audiobooks America recorded David Strathairn (Lincoln) and Richard Dreyfuss (Douglas) reenacting the debates.
