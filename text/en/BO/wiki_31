<text>MESSENGER was a NASA robotic space probe that orbited the planet Mercury between 2011 and 2015, studying Mercury&#x27;s chemical composition, geology, and magnetic field. The name is a backronym for &quot;Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging&quot;, and a reference to the messenger god Mercury from Roman mythology.

&quot;MESSENGER&quot; was launched aboard a Delta II rocket in August 2004. Its path involved a complex series of flybys – the spacecraft flew by Earth once, Venus twice, and Mercury itself three times, allowing it to decelerate relative to Mercury using minimal fuel. During its first flyby of Mercury in January 2008, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; became the second mission, after Mariner 10 in 1975, to reach Mercury.

&quot;MESSENGER&quot; entered orbit around Mercury on March 18, 2011, becoming the first spacecraft to do so. It successfully completed its primary mission in 2012. Following two mission extensions, the spacecraft used the last of its maneuvering propellant to deorbit, impacting the surface of Mercury on April 30, 2015.

== Mission overview ==
&quot;MESSENGER&quot;″s formal data collection mission began on April 4, 2011. The primary mission was completed on March 17, 2012, having collected close to 100,000 images. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; achieved 100% mapping of Mercury on March 6, 2013, and completed its first year-long extended mission on March 17, 2013. The probe&#x27;s second extended mission lasted for over two years, but as its low orbit degraded, it required reboosts to avoid impact. It conducted its final reboost burns on October 24, 2014, and January 21, 2015, before crashing into Mercury on April 30, 2015.

During its stay in Mercury orbit, the probe&#x27;s instruments yielded significant data, including a characterization of Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field and the discovery of water ice at the planet&#x27;s north pole, which had long been suspected on the basis of Earth-based radar data.

==Mission background==

===Previous missions===
In 1973, Mariner 10 was launched by NASA to make multiple flyby encounters of Venus and Mercury. Mariner 10 provided the first detailed data of Mercury, mapping 40–45% of the surface. Mariner 10&#x27;s final flyby of Mercury occurred on March 16, 1975. No subsequent close-range observations of the planet would take place for more than 30 years.

===Proposals for the mission===
In 1998, a study detailed a proposed mission to send an orbiting spacecraft to Mercury, as the planet was at that point the least-explored of the inner planets. In the years following the Mariner 10 mission, subsequent mission proposals to revisit Mercury had appeared too costly, requiring large quantities of propellant and a heavy lift launch vehicle. Moreover, inserting a spacecraft into orbit around Mercury is difficult, because a probe approaching on a direct path from Earth would be accelerated by the Sun&#x27;s gravity and pass Mercury far too quickly to orbit it. However, using a trajectory designed by Chen-wan Yen in 1985, the study showed it was possible to execute a Discovery-class mission by using multiple, consecutive gravity assist, &#x27;swingby&#x27; maneuvers around Venus and Mercury, in combination with minor propulsive trajectory corrections, to gradually slow the spacecraft and thereby minimize propellant needs.

===Objectives===
The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; mission was designed to study the characteristics and environment of Mercury from orbit. The scientific objectives of the mission were:
* to characterize the chemical composition of Mercury&#x27;s surface.
* to study the planet&#x27;s geologic history.
* to elucidate the nature of the global magnetic field (magnetosphere). 
* to determine the size and state of the core.
* to determine the volatile inventory at the poles.
* to study the nature of Mercury&#x27;s exosphere.

==Spacecraft design==

The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; spacecraft was designed and built at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Science operations were managed by Sean Solomon as principal investigator, and mission operations were also conducted at JHU/APL. The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; bus measured tall, wide, and deep. The bus was primarily constructed with four graphite fiber / cyanate ester composite panels that supported the propellant tanks, the large velocity adjust (LVA) thruster, attitude monitors and correction thrusters, the antennas, the instrument pallet, and a large ceramic-cloth sunshade, measuring tall and wide, for passive thermal control. At launch, the spacecraft weighed approximately with its full load of propellant. &quot;MESSENGER&quot;&#x27;s total mission cost, including the cost of the spacecraft&#x27;s construction, was estimated at under US$450 million.

===Attitude control and propulsion===
Main propulsion was provided by the 645 N, 317 sec. Isp bipropellant (hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide) large velocity assist (LVA) thruster. The model used was the LEROS 1b, developed and manufactured at AMPAC‐ISP&#x27;s Westcott works, in the United Kingdom. The spacecraft was designed to carry of propellant and helium pressurizer for the LVA.

Four monopropellant thrusters provided spacecraft steering during main thruster burns, and twelve monopropellant thrusters were used for attitude control. For precision attitude control, a reaction wheel attitude control system was also included. Information for attitude control was provided by star trackers, an inertial measurement unit and six Sun sensors.

===Communications===

The probe included two small deep space transponders for communications with the Deep Space Network and three kinds of antennas: a high gain phased array whose main beam could be electronically steered in one plane, a medium-gain &quot;fan-beam&quot; antenna and a low gain horn with a broad pattern. The high gain antenna was used as transmit-only at 8.4 GHz, the medium-gain and low gain antennas transmit at 8.4 GHz and receive at 7.2 GHz, and all three antennas operate with right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) radiation. One of each of these antennas was mounted on the front of the probe facing the Sun, and one of each was mounted to the back of the probe facing away from the Sun.

===Power===

The space probe was powered by a two-panel gallium arsenide/germanium solar array providing an average of 450 watts while in Mercury orbit. Each panel was rotatable and included optical solar reflectors to balance the temperature of the array. Power was stored in a common-pressure-vessel, 23-ampere-hour nickel–hydrogen battery, with 11 vessels and two cells per vessel.

===Computer and software===

The spacecraft&#x27;s onboard computer system was contained in an Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), a device that combined core avionics into a single box. The computer featured two radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000s, a 25 megahertz main processor, and a 10 MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For data storage, the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one gigabyte each. The IBM RAD6000 main processor collected, compressed, and stored data from &quot;MESSENGER&quot;&#x27;s instruments for later playback to Earth.

&quot;MESSENGER&quot; used a software suite called SciBox to simulate its orbit and instruments, in order to &quot;choreograph the complicated process of maximizing the scientific return from the mission and minimizing conflicts between instrument observations, while at the same time meeting all spacecraft constraints on pointing, data downlink rates, and onboard data storage capacity.&quot;

==Mission profile==
===Launch and trajectory===
The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; probe was launched on August 3, 2004, at 06:15:56 UTC by NASA from Space Launch Complex 17B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, aboard a Delta II 7925 launch vehicle. The complete burn sequence lasted 57 minutes bringing the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit, with a final velocity of 10.68 km/s (6.64 miles/s) and sending the probe into a 7.9 billion-kilometer (4.9 billion mi) trajectory that took 6 years, 7 months and 16 days before its orbital insertion on March 18, 2011.

Traveling to Mercury and entering orbit requires an extremely large velocity change (&quot;see delta-v&quot;) because Mercury&#x27;s orbit is deep in the Sun&#x27;s gravity well. On a direct course from Earth to Mercury, a spacecraft is constantly accelerated as it falls toward the Sun, and will arrive at Mercury with a velocity too high to achieve orbit without excessive use of fuel. For planets with an atmosphere, such as Venus and Mars, spacecraft can minimize their fuel consumption upon arrival by using friction with the atmosphere to enter orbit (aerocapture), or can briefly fire their rocket engines to enter into orbit followed by a reduction of the orbit by aerobraking. However, the tenuous atmosphere of Mercury is far too thin for these maneuvers. Instead, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; extensively used gravity assist maneuvers at Earth, Venus, and Mercury to reduce the speed relative to Mercury, then used its large rocket engine to enter into an elliptical orbit around the planet. The multi-flyby process greatly reduced the amount of propellant necessary to slow the spacecraft, but at the cost of prolonging the trip by many years and to a total distance of 7.9 billion kilometers (4.9 billion miles).

Several planned thruster firings en route to Mercury were unnecessary, because these fine course adjustments were performed using solar radiation pressure acting on MESSENGER&#x27;s solar panels. To further minimize the amount of necessary propellant, the spacecraft orbital insertion targeted a highly elliptical orbit around Mercury.

The elongated orbit had two other benefits: It allowed the spacecraft time to cool after the times it was between the hot surface of Mercury and the Sun, and also it allowed the spacecraft to measure the effects of solar wind and the magnetic fields of the planet at various distances while still allowing close-up measurements and photographs of the surface and exosphere.
The spacecraft was originally scheduled to launch during a 12-day window that beginning May 11, 2004. On March 26, 2004, NASA announced the launch would be moved to a later, 15-day launch window beginning July 30, 2004, to allow for further testing of the spacecraft. This change significantly altered the trajectory of the mission and delayed the arrival at Mercury by two years. The original plan called for three fly-by maneuvers past Venus, with Mercury orbit insertion scheduled for 2009. The trajectory was changed to include one Earth flyby, two Venus flybys, and three Mercury flybys before orbit insertion on March 18, 2011.


===Earth flyby===

&quot;MESSENGER&quot; performed an Earth flyby one year after launch, on August 2, 2005, with the closest approach at 19:13 UTC at an altitude of 2,347 kilometers (1,458 statute miles) over central Mongolia. On December 12, 2005, a 524-second-long burn (Deep-Space Maneuver or DSM-1) of the large thruster adjusted the trajectory for the upcoming Venus flyby by 316 m/s.

During the Earth flyby, the &quot;MESSENGER&quot; team imaged the Earth and Moon using MDIS and checked the status of several other instruments observing the atmospheric and surface compositions and testing the magnetosphere and determining that all instruments tested were working as expected. This calibration period was intended to ensure accurate interpretation of data when the spacecraft entered orbit around Mercury. Ensuring that the instruments functioned correctly at such an early stage in the mission allowed opportunity for multiple minor errors to be dealt with.

The Earth flyby was used to investigate the flyby anomaly, where some spacecraft have been observed to have trajectories that differ slightly from those predicted. However no anomaly was observed in MESSENGER&#x27;s flyby.
===Two Venus flybys===

On October 24, 2006, at 08:34 UTC, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; encountered Venus at an altitude of . During the encounter, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; passed behind Venus and entered superior conjunction, a period when Earth was on the exact opposite side of the Solar System, with the Sun inhibiting radio contact. For this reason, no scientific observations were conducted during the flyby. Communication with the spacecraft was reestablished in late November and performed a deep space maneuver on December 12, to correct the trajectory to encounter Venus in a second flyby.

On June 5, 2007, at 23:08 UTC, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; performed a second flyby of Venus at an altitude of , for the greatest velocity reduction of the mission. During the encounter, all instruments were used to observe Venus and prepare for the following Mercury encounters. The encounter provided visible and near-infrared imaging data of the upper atmosphere of Venus. Ultraviolet and X-ray spectrometry of the upper atmosphere were also recorded, to characterize the composition. The ESA&#x27;s Venus Express was also orbiting during the encounter, providing the first opportunity for simultaneous measurement of particle-and-field characteristics of the planet.


===Three Mercury flybys===

&quot;MESSENGER&quot; made a flyby of Mercury on January 14, 2008 (making its closest approach of 200 km above the surface of Mercury at 19:04:39 UTC), followed by a second flyby on October 6, 2008. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; executed a final flyby on September 29, 2009, further slowing down the spacecraft. Sometime during the closest approach of the last flyby, the spacecraft entered safe mode. Although this had no effect on the trajectory necessary for later orbit insertion, it resulted in the loss of science data and images that were planned for the outbound leg of the fly-by. The spacecraft had fully recovered by about seven hours later. One last deep space maneuver, DSM-5, was executed on November 24, 2009, at 22:45 UTC to provide the required velocity change for the scheduled Mercury orbit insertion on March 18, 2011, marking the beginning of the orbital mission.
===Orbital insertion===
The thruster maneuver to insert the probe into Mercury&#x27;s orbit began at 00:45 UTC on March 18, 2011. The 0.9 km/s (0.5 mi./sec.) braking maneuver lasted about 15 minutes, with confirmation that the craft was in Mercury orbit received at 01:10 UTC on March 18 (9:10 PM, March 17 EDT). Mission lead engineer Eric Finnegan indicated that the spacecraft had achieved a near-perfect orbit.

&quot;MESSENGER&quot;&#x27;s orbit was highly elliptical, taking it within of Mercury&#x27;s surface and then away from it every twelve hours. This orbit was chosen to shield the probe from the heat radiated by Mercury&#x27;s hot surface. Only a small portion of each orbit was at a low altitude, where the spacecraft was subjected to radiative heating from the hot side of the planet.

==Primary science==
After &quot;MESSENGER&quot;&#x27;s orbital insertion, an eighteen-day commissioning phase took place. The supervising personnel switched on and tested the craft&#x27;s science instruments to ensure they had completed the journey without damage. The commissioning phase &quot;demonstrated that the spacecraft and payload [were] all operating nominally, notwithstanding Mercury&#x27;s challenging environment.&quot;

The primary mission began as planned on April 4, 2011, with &quot;MESSENGER&quot; orbiting Mercury once every twelve hours for an intended duration of twelve Earth months, the equivalent of two solar days on Mercury. Principal Investigator Sean Solomon, then of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, said: &quot;With the beginning today of the primary science phase of the mission, we will be making nearly continuous observations that will allow us to gain the first global perspective on the innermost planet. Moreover, as solar activity steadily increases, we will have a front-row seat on the most dynamic magnetosphere–atmosphere system in the Solar System.&quot;

On October 5, 2011, the scientific results obtained by &quot;MESSENGER&quot; during its first six terrestrial months in Mercury&#x27;s orbit were presented in a series of papers at the European Planetary Science Congress in Nantes, France. Among the discoveries presented were the unexpectedly high concentrations of magnesium and calcium found on Mercury&#x27;s nightside, and the fact that Mercury&#x27;s magnetic field is offset far to the north of the planet&#x27;s center.
===Extended mission===

In November 2011, NASA announced that the &quot;MESSENGER&quot; mission would be extended by one year, allowing the spacecraft to observe the 2012 solar maximum. Its extended mission began on March 17, 2012, and continued until March 17, 2013. Between April 16 and 20, 2012, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; carried out a series of thruster manoeuvres, placing it in an eight-hour orbit to conduct further scans of Mercury.

In November 2012, NASA reported that &quot;MESSENGER&quot; had discovered a possibility of both water ice and organic compounds in permanently shadowed craters in Mercury&#x27;s north pole. In February 2013, NASA published the most detailed and accurate 3D map of Mercury to date, assembled from thousands of images taken by &quot;MESSENGER&quot;. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; completed its first extended mission on March 17, 2013, and its second lasted until April 2015. In November 2013, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; was among the numerous space assets that imaged Comet Encke (2P/Encke) and Comet ISON (C/2012 S1). As its orbit began to decay in early 2015, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; was able to take highly detailed close-up photographs of ice-filled craters and other landforms at Mercury&#x27;s north pole. After the mission was completed, review of the radio ranging data provided the first measurement of the rate of mass loss from the Sun.
===Discovery of water, organic compounds and volcanism===
On July 3, 2008, the &quot;MESSENGER&quot; team announced that the probe had discovered large amounts of water present in Mercury&#x27;s exosphere, which was an unexpected finding. In the later years of its mission, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; also provided visual evidence of past volcanic activity on the surface of Mercury, as well as evidence for a liquid iron planetary core. The probe also constructed the most detailed and accurate maps of Mercury to date, and furthermore discovered carbon-containing organic compounds and water ice inside permanently shadowed craters near the north pole.
===Solar System portrait===

On February 18, 2011, a portrait of the Solar System was published on the &quot;MESSENGER&quot; website. The mosaic contained 34 images, acquired by the MDIS instrument during November 2010. All the planets were visible with the exception of Uranus and Neptune, due to their vast distances from the Sun. The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; &quot;family portrait&quot; was intended to be complementary to the Voyager family portrait, which was acquired from the outer Solar System by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; on February 14, 1990.

===View of a total lunar eclipse===
On October 8, 2014 from 9:18 UTC to 10:18 UTC, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; took 31 images, taken two minutes apart, of the Earth and the Moon, as the Moon underwent a total lunar eclipse. MESSENGER was 107 million kilometers (66 million miles) from the Earth at the time of the lunar eclipse. The Earth is about 5 pixels across and the Moon is just over 1 pixel across in the field of view of the NAC, with about 40 pixels distance between them. The images are zoomed by a factor of two and the Moon&#x27;s brightness has been increased by a factor of about 25 to show its disappearance more clearly. This was the first observation of a lunar eclipse, of Earth&#x27;s Moon, in history to be viewed from another planet.

==End of mission==
After running out of propellant for course adjustments, &quot;MESSENGER&quot; entered its expected terminal phase of orbital decay in late 2014. The spacecraft&#x27;s operation was extended by several weeks by exploiting its remaining supply of helium gas, which was used to pressurize its propellant tanks, as reaction mass. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; continued studying Mercury during its decay period. The spacecraft crashed onto the surface of Mercury on April 30, 2015, at 3:26 p.m. EDT (19:26 GMT), at a velocity of , probably creating a crater in the planet&#x27;s surface approximately wide. The spacecraft was estimated to have impacted at 54.4° N, 149.9° W on Suisei Planitia, near the crater Janáček. The crash occurred at a place not visible from Earth at the time, and thus was not detected by any observers or instruments. NASA confirmed the end of the &quot;MESSENGER&quot; mission at 3:40 p.m. EDT (19:40 GMT) after NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network did not detect the spacecraft&#x27;s reemergence from behind Mercury.

<doc id="451841" wikidata="Q11400811" url="?curid=451841" title="Music of North Africa">
<text>North Africa has contributed considerably to popular music, especially Egyptian classical music alongside el Gil, Algerian raï and Chaabi (internationally-known tubes such as &quot;Ya Rayah&quot;-Dahman El Harrachi or Aicha-Cheb Khaled). The broad region is sometimes called Maghreb (excluding Egypt), and the term Maghrebian music is in use. For a variety of reasons Libya does not have as extensive nor popular a tradition as its neighbours. Folk music abounds, however, despite frequent condemnation and suppression from governments, existing in multiple forms across the region—the Berbers, Sephardic Jews, Tuaregs, Copts and Nubians, for example, retain musical traditions with their ancient roots. 

Andalusian music is especially influential, and is played in widely varying forms across the region. This music was imported from Andalusia in the 15th century, after Spain expelled the Moors from that province. The Spanish conquest of the historically Muslim Iberian Peninsula had been going on for some time, and resulted in the emigration of many Iberian Muslims, who were themselves descended from people from across the Mediterranean, into North Africa. These people brought with them a vibrant tradition that had arisen as a fusion of various kinds of Muslim music from Baghdad, Istanbul, Egypt and elsewhere. The best-known derivatives of this style are al-âla in Morocco, Nuubaat and other related styles in Algeria and Ma&#x27;luf in Tunisia.

==Traditions==

===Algeria===

Of all the North African countries, Algeria&#x27;s popular music may be the best-known abroad. Raï, a style of urban popular music developed in early 20th century Oran, has become a common sound in parts of Europe, especially France (which has a large Algerian population) since the late 1980s. The music of the Berber Kabyle people and Chaabi are both also renowned throughout the country, and in France.

Developed from musical styles which were themselves borrowed from Andalusia in the 15th century, Algerian Nuubaat is a kind of classical music that remains popular in much of the country. Over the years, it has evolved into related styles like the rabaab and hawzii.

===Egypt===

Egypt&#x27;s best-known popular tradition is the classical Egyptian music of stars like Abdel Halim Hafez. Other prominent modern styles include Shaabi, el Gil, and Egyptian pop.

===Libya===

Libyan music, like the music of other North African countries, consists of both local and foreign elements. The factors important to the development of music in Libya are: indigenous North African music, Arabic music theory, language and culture, and Ottoman Turkish music. Because of these factors, Libya&#x27;s musical heritage can be further divided into four types:
1. Ceremonial music that is associated with the culture and customs of the Sufi-Turugs.
2. Classical vocal music that belongs to the traditional Arab music of Al-Andalus (Muslim Spain, 730-1494 Ad.), and includes Al-muash&#x27;shahat and Al-maluf.
3. Classical instrumental music, which evolved from the Arab art-music heritage and was inspired by Turkish elements.
4. Libyan folk music, which also features Central African and Arab musical influences styles.

===Tunisia===

Tunisia is best known as the centre for ma&#x27;luf, a derivative of the Andalusian music imported to North Africa in the 15th century. Since the 1930s, a number of organisations (as well as the first President of Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba) have been promoting ma&#x27;luf as an integral aspect of Tunisian culture, helping to keep the ancient tradition alive.

Since the 2000s, modern styles have penetrated the market and been adapted to Tunisian culture, such as reggae or hip hop. Many artists like Weld El 15 received public notoriety from the Tunisian revolution for criticising the ancient regime in its abuse of power during the country&#x27;s democratisation process.

<text>Nikolai von Michalewsky (a.k.a. Mark Brandis) (January 17, 1931 – December 27, 2000) was a German writer and journalist best known for a series of science fiction novels published between 1970 and 1987.

==Biography==
Von Michalewsky was born in Dahlewitz, a town on the outskirts of Berlin. After having earned his living as a dock worker, a coffee harvester in the Congo, and a diver in the Mediterranean, he worked as a journalist in the Algerian war, eventually to start writing fictional works in the late 1950s, mostly juvenile novels. He expanded his field to documentary filming and writing of radio drama in the 1960s, an expertise he became very successful at. At the end of his life he would have more than 500 broadcast radio dramas to his name. 
In 1969 he was approached by German book publisher Herder to write a science fiction book for juveniles. Despite having no previous experience in the field of science fiction, von Michalewsky&#x27;s first book in the genre, &quot;Bordbuch Delta VII&quot;, was an instant success.

Using the name of his protagonist as pen name and writing in first person perspective, von Michalewsky would pen approximately two books a year over the following decades to eventually complete a series of 31 novels. The series became the second best-selling German-language science fiction series of all time, eclipsed only by team effort Perry Rhodan. The books were translated into Danish, Dutch, French, Italian, Spanish and Chinese. A late attempt to revive the series in 1999 was limited to one novel, &quot;Ambivalente Zone&quot;. This expanded universe series was cut short when von Michalewsky died at Grasberg shortly after Christmas 2000, leaving the second novel, &quot;Negativer Sektor&quot;, unfinished.

===Mark Brandis series ===

The Mark Brandis series can be categorized as hard science fiction space opera with many allusions to seafaring novels. Mankind has been exploring the solar system, setting up colonies on the Moon and Venus. Earth is controlled by two superpowers, the &quot;Union of Europe, the Americas and Africa&quot; (&quot;EAAU&quot;) opposing the &quot;United Oriental Republics&quot; (&quot;VOR&quot;, that is Asia). The respective capitals are Beijing and an artificial Atlantic city named Metropolis. Mark Brandis, a German-born astronaut, works as a test pilot for a nominally independent EAAU institution, the &quot;Venus-Earth Astronautical Society&quot; (VEGA). His work with the newest and therefore fastest and strongest spaceships often puts him and the international crews of his ships into danger, be it revolutions, ecological catastrophes, overpopulation issues, space exploration, equipment malfunctions and civil war.

After volume 20, Brandis quits his job to run an independent society dedicated to rescue ship crews suffering emergencies in space Operating a number of modern high-speed space rescue ships from an extraterritorial moon base, the society rescues numerous space crews and plays an important role in various adventures not too dissimilar in style to the VEGA adventures. As in the early novels, political diplomacy and difficult ethical choices play an important role, as well as the constant fighting to keep the space rescue service in operation on a tight budget and in spite of warring factions and interests.

The ships of the rescue service are named after people famous for their humanitarian efforts, such as Elsa Brändström, Florence Nightingale, Henri Dunant, Albert Schweitzer, Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore.

<doc id="451845" wikidata="Q1146335" url="?curid=451845" title="Teen film">
<text>Teen film is a film genre targeted at teenagers, preteens and/or young adults by the plot being based on their special interests, such as coming of age, attempting to fit in, bullying, peer pressure, first love, teen rebellion, conflict with parents, and teen angst or alienation. Often these normally serious subject matters are presented in a glossy, stereotyped or trivialized way. Many teenage characters are portrayed by young adult actors in their 20s. Some teen films appeal to young males, while others appeal to young females.

Films in this genre are often set in high schools and colleges, or contain characters who are of high school or college age.

==Types==
Teen film genres include
* Teen drama
* Teen comedy

Additional types of teen films can be divided again into sub-categories. These can be found at list of teen films.

===Beach films===
Early examples of the genre in the United States include the &quot;beach party films&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s, such as the &quot;Gidget&quot; series.

==Codes and conventions==
Codes and conventions of teen films vary depending on the cultural context of the film, but they can include puberty, proms, alcohol, illegal substances, high school, parties, virginity, teen pregnancy, social groups and cliques, interpersonal conflict with peers and/or the older generations, fitting in, peer pressure, and popular culture.

The classic codes and conventions of the teen film come from American films. One of the most widely used conventions is an emphasis on stereotypes and social groups. The stereotypes most commonly used include:

* The Jock / Cheerleader
* School Diva (Alternately The It Girl)
* The Geek / Nerd
* The Rebel
* The Misfit / Outcast
* The Boy/Girl next door
* The New Kid
* The Loner
* The Band Geek
* Class Clown
* The Athlete
* The Queen Bee
* The Foreign Exchange Student

Apart from the characters, there are many other codes and conventions of teen film. These films are often set in or around high schools and places frequented by teens, such as shopping malls and themed restaurants. This technique allows for many different social cliques to be shown. These settings are typical for the classic romantic comedy teen film.

==Common archetypes==
A good example of the use of archetypes in the teen film was displayed in the 1985 film, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;. These archetypes have since become a larger part of the culture. The jock, cheerleader, and social outcast, among others, become a familiar and pleasurable feature for the audience. However, genres are dynamic; they change and develop to meet the expectations of their target audience.

==Notable writers and directors==

===Herman Raucher===
Herman Raucher, along with Robert Mulligan, popularized the genre with &quot;Summer of &#x27;42&quot; (1971), and Raucher continued the trend by writing &quot;Class of &#x27;44&quot; (1973).

===George Lucas===
George Lucas has been credited for perfecting the genre by writing and directing &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973).

===John Hughes===
The genre gained more credibility during the 1980s with the works of writer and director John Hughes. His legacy of teen films, including &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;Sixteen Candles&quot;, and many more, proved to be popular not only with audiences but also with critics.

===Gregg Araki===
Gregg Araki filmed independent films in the 1990s. His films, particularly the &quot;Teen Apocalypse Trilogy&quot; (consisting of &quot;Totally Fucked Up&quot;, &quot;The Doom Generation&quot;, and &quot;Nowhere&quot;), are notable for capturing the disaffected attitudes of suburban teenagers of Generation X.

===Éric Rohmer===
Éric Rohmer, a pioneering director of the French New Wave, was notable for focusing on young adults or youth and their complications with love in a number of his films. Some of these works are &quot;La Collectionneuse&quot;, &quot;Claire&#x27;s Knee&quot;, &quot;Pauline at the Beach&quot;, &quot;My Girlfriend&#x27;s Boyfriend&quot;, and &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

==Noteworthy actors==

<doc id="451846" wikidata="Q4708297" url="?curid=451846" title="Haltija">
<text>A haltija (haltia) is a spirit, gnome, or elf-like creature in Finnish mythology that guards, helps, or protects something or somebody. The word is possibly derived from the Gothic &quot;haltijar&quot;, which referred to the original settler of a homestead—although this is not the only possible etymology. It can also be derived from the Finnish verb &quot;hallita&quot;, which means &#x27;to rule&#x27;, &#x27;to command&#x27;, &#x27;to master&#x27;.

The word is also used in modern Finnish to mean, depending on the context, holder, occupant, lord, master, owner-occupier, occupier, possessor, bearer, or owner.

There are many different kinds of haltijas. There are, for example water haltijas and forest haltijas. Even graveyards have their own haltijas (&quot;kalman väki&quot;, &quot;death folk&quot;).

Human settlements also have haltijas. One type is the tonttu or maan haltija (land haltija). The tonttu is the Finnish version of the Swedish tomte. The Finnish tonttu and the Swedish tomte are related to the words &quot;tontti&quot; (Finnish) and &quot;tomt&quot; (Swedish), which both mean building lot and building site. (Later, such local spirits are also referred to as a &quot;tomtegubbe&quot; [&quot;old man of the homestead&quot;] in Swedish). The kotihaltija (home elf, home gnome) is the tonttu who lives in every home. He takes care of the house, and it is important to treat him with respect. The saunatonttu lives in the sauna and protects it but also makes sure that people do not behave improperly in it. &quot;Joulutonttu&quot; is Finnish for Christmas elf. Unlike the Christmas elves in some countries, the Finnish joulutonttu doesn&#x27;t have pointy ears.

There are even personal haltijas, which are protective spirits that are part of the plural human soul in Finno-Ugric animism. Haltijas are not like Christian angels, but have some resemblances to other spirit guide type forces found in indigenous folklore worldwide.

In Estonian mythology a similar being is called &quot;haldjas&quot;, whereas the term used in Estonian for a holder, master, or owner-occupier is &quot;haldaja&quot;.

Haltija is sometimes written as &quot;haltia&quot;. Nowadays this more old-fashioned spelling often refers to the elves in Tolkien&#x27;s books or other fantasy literature.

==Folk and power==
Some haltijas are divided into races or folks, which are called väki. &quot;Väki&quot; is a polysemic term, and has been used in multiple conflicting meanings, and assigning only one definition to it is not consistent with the source material. &quot;Väki&quot; means either &quot;strength/power&quot; or &quot;group/corps (of people)&quot; (e.g. &quot;väkiviina&quot; &quot;strong liquor&quot; vs. &quot;sotaväki&quot; &quot;the military&quot;), of which the meaning of &quot;power&quot; is etymologically older. The meaning of &quot;väki&quot; meaning &quot;folk&quot; is the result of the anthropomorphication of abstract concepts like &quot;kalman väki&quot;, &quot;the power of dead spirits&quot;. It does not constitute a separate supernatural force like mana, but is a generic concept for &quot;potency&quot; or &quot;power&quot;, including and not separately distinguishing magical potency. There are different kind of väkis of haltijas, like &quot;veden väki&quot; (water folk) or &quot;metsän väki&quot; (forest folk). In this context, the word &quot;väki&quot; can refer to them as a folk, their magical powers, or usually both at the same time. For example, if someone gets sick while swimming, this could be caused by &quot;väki&quot; of water that become attached to a person. In this sense &quot;väki&quot; is more like a magical power emanating from water that can make people ill, but it can also mean that &quot;haltijas&quot; (spirits) are attached to a person. In comparison, if someone goes fishing, they can ask for &quot;väki&quot; of water to bring fish by calling individual &quot;haltijas&quot; belonging to that &quot;väki&quot; by their names, wherein &quot;väki&quot; is understood more as a folk.

Some väkis of haltijas:
*Väki of forest (metsän väki) means haltijas of forest. Their leader is Tapio, the king of the forest. It also means magical powers of the forest.
*Väki of water (veden väki) means haltijas of water. Their leader is Ahti, the king of the sea. Veden väki is also the magical power of water that can make people sick or heal them.
*Väki of woman (naisen väki) is usually understood as special magical powers of women.
*Väki of death (kalman väki) means ghosts and spirits, but also the magical power that can be found in a graveyard. This power can make people ill and it can also be used against other people.
*Väki of fire: (tulen väki) means spirits of fire, but also the destructive forces of fire and healing power of warm air, for example in a sauna.
*Väki of mountain (vuoren väki) usually means the haltijas of hills and big stones.
*Väki of wood (puun väki) means the race of haltijas of trees, and also the power of wooden material, which can cause pain if you are hit by a wooden object.
*Väki of iron (raudan väki) means haltijas of iron. They can hurt people who are hit by bladed weapons. Väki of iron can also be commanded to heal the wounds they have given.

Haltija väkis of different environments and materials were thought to be in conflict with each other. For example, when wood is burned, it is an assault in which väki of fire is beating väki of wood. Väki of fire can be used to scare other väki away. For example, if you were made ill by väki of water, that attached to you while you were swimming, this väki and the illness could be removed in sauna, which had many väki of fire.

<doc id="451848" wikidata="Q1657782" url="?curid=451848" title="Domovoy">
<text>In the Slavic religious tradition, Domovoy (, literally &quot;[the one] of the household&quot;; also spelled &quot;Domovoi&quot;, &quot;Domovoj&quot;, and known as , (&quot;Domovik&quot;), (&quot;Domovyk&quot;) and (&quot;Damavik&quot;)) is the household spirit of a given kin. According to the Russian folklorist E. G. Kagarov, the Domovoy is a personification of the supreme Rod in the microcosm of kinship. Sometimes he has a female counterpart, Domania, the goddess of the household, though he is most often a single god. The Domovoy expresses himself as a number of other spirits of the household in its different functions.

==Etymology and belief==
The term &quot;Domovoy&quot; comes from the Indo-European root *&quot;dom&quot;, which is shared by many words in the semantic field of &quot;abode&quot;, &quot;domain&quot; in the Indo-European languages (cf. Latin &quot;domus&quot;, &quot;house&quot;). The Domovoy have been compared to the Roman &quot;Di Penates&quot;, the &quot;genii&quot; of the family. Helmold ( 1120–1177), in his &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot;, alluded to the widespread worship of &quot;penates&quot; among the Elbe Slavs. In the &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; of Cosmas of Prague ( 1045–1125) it is written that Czech, one of the three mythical forefathers of the Slavs, brought the statues of the &quot;penates&quot; on his shoulders to the new country, and, resting on the mountain of the Rzip, said to his fellows:

The Domovoy are believed to protect the well-being of a kin in any of its aspects. They are very protective towards the children and the animals of the house, constantly looking after them. These gods are often represented as fighting with one another, to protect and make grow the welfare of their kin. In such warfare, the Domovoy of the eventual winner family is believed to take possession of the household of the vanquished rivals.

They are believed to share the joys and the sorrows of the family, and to be able to forebode and warn about future events, such as the imminent death of a kindred person, plagues, wars or other calamities which threaten the welfare of the kin. The Domovoy become angry and reveal their demonic aspect if the family is corrupted by bad behaviour and language. In this case, the god may even quit and leave the kin unprotected against illness and calamity.

==Iconography and worship==
The Domovoy is usually represented as an old, grey-haired man with flashing eyes. He may manifest in the form of animals, such as cats, dogs or bears, but also as the master of the house or a departed ancestor of the given family, sometimes provided with a tail and little horns. In some traditions the Domovoy are symbolised as snakes. Household gods were represented by the Slavs as statuettes, made of clay or stone, which were placed in niches near the house&#x27;s door, and later on the mantelpieces above the ovens. They were attired in the distinct costume of the tribe to which the kin belonged.

Sacrifices in honour of the Domovoy are practised to make him participate in the life of the kin, and to appease and reconcile him in the case of anger. These include the offering of what is left of the evening meal, or, in cases of great anger, the sacrifice of a cock at midnight and the sprinkling of the nooks and corners of the common hall or the courtyard with the animal&#x27;s blood. Otherwise, a slice of bread strewn with salt and wrapped in a white cloth is offered in the hall or the courtyard while the members of the kin bow towards the four directions reciting prayers to the Domovoy.

The Domovoy is believed to be somehow connected with the house building itself, so sacrifices are also practised when a family moved to a newly built house to invite the god to inhabit it. In this case, a hen and the first slice of bread cut for the first dinner in the new house are offered to the god and buried in the courtyard, reciting the formula:

Similar rituals are practised to invite a Domovoy to transfer from one house to another, and to welcome him.

==Other household deities==
Other household gods, or expressions of the Domovoy, are:
* Dvorovoy – tutelary deity of the courtyard
* Bannik – &quot;Bath Spirit&quot;, the tutelary deity of the private or public bathhouses, who corresponds to the Komi &quot;Pyvsiansa&quot;
* Ovinnik (Belarusian: Joŭnik) – &quot;Threshing Barn Spirit&quot;
* Prigirstitis – known for his fine hearing
* Krimba – household goddess among the Bohemians
* The lizard-shaped Giwoitis

==Alternative naming==
Some English-speaking authors interpret the name &quot;domovoy&quot; as &quot;house elf&quot;.

The Slavic languages and their local forms have variations of the term &quot;Domovoy&quot; and alternative names to describe the household god, including:

* Děd, Dĕdek, Děduška (names of this form convey the concept of &quot;grandfather&quot;, Czech)
* Did, Didko, Diduch, Domovyk (Ukrainian)
* Damavik (Belarusian)
* Dedek, Djadek
* Šetek, Šotek (Czech)
* Skřítek (Czech)
* Škrata, Škriatok (Slovak)
* Škrat, Škratek (Slovenian)
* Skrzatek, Skrzat, Skrzot (Polish)
* Chozyain, Chozyainuško (Russian) (meaning literally &quot;master&quot; and &quot;little master&quot;)
* Stopan (Bulgarian)
* Domovníček, Hospodáříček (Czech)
* Domaći (Croatian)
* Zmek, Smok, Ćmok (snake form)

The female counterpart &quot;Domania&quot; can appear as:

* Domovikha ()
* Damavukha ()
* Kikimora
* Marukha
* Volossatka

The household spirit may also be called Zhikharko ( in northern governorates of Russia. It is described as short, disheveled, with a big beard, good-natured, harmless and a big joker.

<text>The governor-general of Barbados was the representative of the Barbadian monarch from independence in 1966 until the establishment of a republic in 2021. Under the government&#x27;s Table of Precedence for Barbados, the governor-general of Barbados was regarded as being the most important of all personnel of the Barbados government.

The office was established by Chapter IV of the 1966 Constitution of Barbados. The governor-general was appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister of Barbados. The governor-general exercised the monarch&#x27;s executive powers and gave assent to bills in the monarch&#x27;s name, promulgating them as laws. The powers of the monarch and the governor-general were limited, and they, in most instances, exercised authority on the advice of the prime minister or other persons or bodies within Barbados.

The office of the governor-general was established when Barbados gained independence in 1966. Since then, Barbados had 8 governors-general. On 30 November 2021, Barbados became a republic and the office of governor-general was abolished.

==Duties==
The Barbadian monarch, on the advice of her Barbadian prime minister, appointed a governor-general to be her representative in Barbados. Both the monarch and the governor-general held much power in the country, though it was rarely used unilaterally; it was usually only used in such a way in emergencies and in some cases war.

The governor-general represented the monarch on ceremonial occasions such as the State Opening of Parliament and the presentation of honours and military parades. Under the constitution, the governor-general was given authority to act in some matters; for example, in appointing and disciplining officers of the civil service, granting &quot;any person convicted of any offence against the laws of Barbados a pardon&quot;, and in proroguing parliament. However, in only a few cases was the governor-general empowered to act entirely on his/her own discretion, often requiring the countersignature of the prime minister to exercise their powers.

The governor-general of Barbados also chaired the Privy Council of Barbados.

==List of governors-general of Barbados==
Following is a list of people who served as governor-general of Barbados from independence in 1966 to the establishment of a republic in 2021.

The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving royal assent to legislation passed by the National Assembly; and issuing writs for election.

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining a political neutrality, and has to act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official residenceBelize House in the capital, Belmopanand bestowing honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Belize and its monarch.

Governors-general are appointed for a seven-year term of office. Since 27 May 2021, the governor-general has been Dame Froyla Tzalam.

The office of the governor-general was created on 21 September 1981, when Belize gained independence from the United Kingdom as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, three individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==

The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of Belize. When a new governor-general is to be appointed, the current prime minister recommends a name to the monarch, who by convention accepts that recommendation. At the installation ceremony, the new governor-general takes an Oath of Allegiance and Office. These oaths are administered by the chief justice of Belize.

==Functions==

The governor-general&#x27;s powers and roles are derive from the Constitution of Belize&#x27;s Part IV, sections 30 to 35 and set out certain provisions relating to the governor-general.

===Constitutional role===

The governor-general is responsible for dissolving parliament and issues writs for new elections. After an election, the governor-general formally requests the leader of the political party which gains the support of a majority in parliament to form a government. The governor-general commissions the prime minister and appoints other ministers after the election.

The prime minister keeps the governor-general fully informed concerning the general conduct of the government of Belize and furnishes the governor-general with such information as the governor-general may request with respect to any particular matter relating to the government of Belize.

The governor-general, on the Sovereign&#x27;s behalf, gives royal assent to laws passed by the National Assembly of Belize.

The governor-general acts on the advice of government ministers, to issue regulations, proclamations under existing laws, to appoint state judges, ambassadors and high commissioners to overseas countries, and other senior government officials.

The governor-general is also responsible for issuing Royal Commissions of Inquiry, and other matters, as required by particular legislation; and authorises many other executive decisions by ministers such as approving treaties with foreign governments.

The governor-general may, in certain circumstances, exercise without – or contrary to – ministerial advice. These are known as the reserve powers, and include:
*appointing a prime minister if an election has resulted in a &#x27;hung parliament&#x27;.
*dismissing the prime minister after the prime minister lost the confidence of the parliament.
*dismissing any minister acting unlawfully.
*refusing to dissolve the House of Representatives despite a request from the prime minister.

The governor-general also presents honours at investitures to persons for notable service to the community, or for acts of bravery.

==Privileges==

===Salary===

The &quot;Governor-General (Conditions of Service) Act 1989&quot; defines the salary, pension and other entitlements of the governor-general. The act was amended in 2021 to provide for a fixed seven-year term of office and raise the governor-general&#x27;s salary to BZ$75,000. This was the first increase in salary since 1989.

===Symbols===

The governor-general uses a personal flag, which features a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with &quot;Belize&quot; written across a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. It is flown on buildings and other locations in Belize to mark the governor-general&#x27;s presence.

A viceregal salute —composed of the first verse of &quot;God Save the King&quot; followed by the chorus of the Belizean National Anthem, &quot;Land of the Free&quot;— is used to greet the governor-general upon arrival at, and mark his or her departure from most official events.

===Residences===

The governor general resided at Government House, Belize until 1984, even after the capital had moved to Belmopan in 1970. In 1984, the governor general moved to Belize House in Belmopan, formerly the residence of the British High Commission on North Ring Road and Melhado Parade.

<doc id="451855" wikidata="Q3348002" url="?curid=451855" title="Central Reserve Police Force">
<text>The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is a central armed police force in India under the Ministry of Home Affairs. The CRPF assists states and Union Territories in maintaining law and order and internal security. It is composed of the Central Reserve Police Force (Regular) and Central Reserve Police Force (Auxiliary).

It was established on 27 July 1939 as Crown Representative&#x27;s Police with the objective of providing security to the British Crown Representatives in India. The force was later renamed as the Central Reserve Police Force by an Act of Parliament in 1949. The CRPF played a major role in the Parliamentary elections of September 1999. 

The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) is the largest paramilitary force in India, comprising 247 battalions and exceeding a total strength of 301,376 personnel as of 2019. CRPF officers are also deployed in United Nations missions.

==History==
Originally constituted as the Crown Representative Police in 1939, CRP was raised in response to the political unrest and agitations in the then Princely States of India following the Madras Resolution of the All-India Congress Committee in 1936 and the ever-growing desire of the Crown Representative to help the vast majority of the native States preserve law and order as part of imperial policy.

After Independence, the force was renamed the Central Reserve Police Force by an Act of Parliament on 28 December 1949. This Act constituted CRPF as an armed force of the Union. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the then Home Minister, visualised a multi-dimensional role for it in tune with the changing needs of a newly independent nation. The force played a significant role during the amalgamation of the princely States into the Indian Union. It helped the Union Government discipline the rebellious princely State of Junagadh and the small principality of Kathiawar in Gujarat which had declined to join the Indian Union.

During the early 1950s, the performance of the CRPF detachments in enforcing law and order in Bhuj, the then Patiala and East Punjab States Union and Chambal ravines was appreciated by all quarters. 

On 21 October 1959, SI Karam Singh and 20 other CRPF personnel were attacked by the Chinese Army at Hot Springs in Ladakh resulting in 10 casualties. The survivors were imprisoned. Since then, 21 October has been observed as Police Commemoration day nationwide, across all states in India.

In the late 50s and early 60s, contingents of the CRPF were sent to Kutch, Rajasthan, and Sindh borders to check infiltration and trans-border crimes. They were, subsequently, deployed on the Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir following attacks launched by the Pakistani infiltrators.

During the Sino-Indian War of 1962, the Force once again assisted the Indian Army in Arunachal Pradesh. Eight CRPF personnel were killed in action. In the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak wars also the Force fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian Army, both on the Western and Eastern borders.

For the first time in history, thirteen companies of CRPF were airlifted to join the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka to fight the militant cadres. Besides, CRPF personnel were also sent to Haiti, Namibia, Somalia, and Maldives to deal with the law and order situation there, as a part of the UN Peacekeeping Force.

In the late seventies, when extremist elements disturbed the peace in Tripura and Manipur, CRPF battalions were deployed in strength. Simultaneously, there was turmoil in the Brahmaputra Valley. The CRPF had to be inducted in strength not only to maintain law and order but also to keep lines of communication free from disruption. The commitments of the Force continue to be very high in the Northeast in dealing with the insurgency.

==Organization==
===Administration===
The CRPF is headed by a Director General and is assisted by 3 Additional Director Generals, 9 Inspector Generals, a Financial Advisor, and a Director (Medical). It is divided into ten administrative sectors, each headed by an inspector general. Each sector consists of one or more administrative and/or Operational Ranges, headed by an officer of the rank of deputy inspector general (DIG) of Police. Now, Group Centres are also headed by DIGs.

<text>Vampyromorphida is an order of cephalopods comprising one known extant species (&quot;Vampyroteuthis infernalis&quot;) and many extinct taxa. Physically, they somewhat resemble octopuses (their closest relatives), but are often called vampire squids. Unlike octopuses, their eight arms are united by a web of skin, and two smaller cilia are also present. Properly speaking, the vampire squid does not possess cilia, but cirri (cilia-like projections). Unlike most cephalopods, which are high-energy hunters, the vampire squid has an extremely low metabolic rate. This adaptation means it requires less oxygen and its food lasts longer, helping it conserve energy and thrive in these harsh deep-sea conditions. Studies show its oxygen consumption is among the lowest of any cephalopod, allowing it to occupy a competition-free niche in the deep sea where few predators or competitors can follow, since not many can survive.

==Classification==
*Order Vampyromorphida
**Suborder †Kelaenina
***Family †Muensterellidae
**Suborder †Prototeuthina

The following taxa were long considered to belong to Vampyromorphida, but this placement may be incorrect:
*Family †Plesioteuthididae 
*Family †Leptotheuthidae
*Family †Trachyteuthididae
**Subfamily †Trachyteuthidinae
**Subfamily †Actinosepiinae

<doc id="451871" wikidata="Q1544231" url="?curid=451871" title="Great Black Swamp">
<text>The Great Black Swamp (also known simply as the Black Swamp) was a glacially fed wetland in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana, United States, that existed from the end of the Wisconsin glaciation until the late 19th century. Comprising extensive swamps and marshes, with some higher, drier ground interspersed, it occupied what was formerly the southwestern part of proglacial Lake Maumee, a Holocene precursor to Lake Erie. The area was about wide (north to south) and long, covering an estimated . Gradually drained and settled in the second half of the 19th century, it is now highly productive farmland. However, this development has been detrimental to the ecosystem as a result of agricultural runoff. This runoff, in turn, has contributed to frequent toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie.

The land once covered by the swamp lies primarily within the Maumee River and Portage River watersheds in northwest Ohio and northeast Indiana. The boundary was determined primarily by ancient sandy beach ridges formed on the shores of Lakes Maumee and Whittlesey, after glacial retreat several thousand years ago. It stretched roughly from Fort Wayne, Indiana, eastward to the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge near Port Clinton along the Lake Erie shore, and from (roughly) US 6 south to Findlay and North Star, Ohio in Darke County. Near its southern edge at the southwestern corner of present-day Auglaize County, wheeled transportation was impossible during most of the year, and local residents thought the rigors of travel to be unsuitable for anyone except adult men.

The vast swamp was a network of forests, wetlands, and grasslands. In the lowest, flattest areas, prone to permanent inundation, deciduous swamp forests predominated, characterized especially by species of ash, elm, cottonwood and sycamore. In slightly higher areas with some topographic relief and better drainage, beech, maples, basswood, tuliptree and other more mesic species were dominant. On elevated beach ridges and moraines with good to excessive drainage, more xeric species, especially oak and hickory, were dominant. The area contained non-forested wetlands, particularly marsh and wet prairies, with marshes being particularly extensive along the Lake Erie shoreline east of Toledo.
==Draining the swamp==

Although much of the area to the east, south, and north was settled in the early 19th century, the dense habitat and difficulty of travel through the swamp delayed its development by several decades. A corduroy road (from modern-day Fremont, Ohio, to Perrysburg, Ohio) was constructed through the Maumee Road Lands in 1825, and was overlaid with gravel in 1838. Travel in the wet season could still take days or even weeks. The impassibility of the swamp was an obstacle during the so-called Toledo War (1835–36); unable to traverse the swamp, the Michigan and Ohio militias never came to battle. Settlement of the region was also inhibited by endemic malaria. The disease was a chronic problem for residents of the region until the area was drained and former mosquito-breeding grounds were dried up.

In the 1850s, the states began an organized attempt to drain the swamp for agricultural use and ease of travel. Various projects were undertaken over a 40-year period. Bowling Green, Ohio resident James B. Hill expedited the draining of swampy areas with his Buckeye Traction Ditcher. Hill&#x27;s ditching machine laid drainage tiles at a record pace. The area was largely drained and settled over the next three decades. The development of railroads and a local drainage tile industry are thought to have contributed greatly to drainage and settlement.

==Restoration==

During the second half of the 20th century, efforts were undertaken to preserve and restore portions of the swamp to its pre-settlement state (e.g. Limberlost Swamp) After the excessive spread of harmful algal blooms in nearby western Lake Erie returned in 2011 and every year since then, there has been renewed interest in restoring wetlands in the drained Black Swamp area. William J. Mitsch (2017) called for the restoration and creation of of treatment wetlands in the former Black Swamp or 10% of the former wetland, as needed to significantly reduce phosphorus inflow by 40% from the polluted Maumee River to Lake Erie.

The Black Swamp Conservancy, founded in 1993, has also been involved in preserving former swamplands. They currently protect spread throughout the Northwest Ohio region. 

Metroparks Toledo is another regional leader in wetland restoration, most notably through the creation of Howard Marsh Metropark. This restored wetland converted nearly of historical agricultural land into a prosperous wetland that now boasts over half of the bird species found throughout Ohio. Pearson Metropark is another example of both a historic, old growth wet forest, paired with sections of restored wetlands.

<doc id="451877" wikidata="Q269326" url="?curid=451877" title="The Killer (1989 film)">
<text>The Killer () is a 1989 Hong Kong action film directed and written by John Woo and produced by Tsui Hark. The film stars Chow Yun-fat, Danny Lee and Sally Yeh. Chow plays Ah Jong, a professional assassin for the Triads who wants to retire, but accidentally damages the eyes of singer Jennie (Yeh) during a shootout and sets out to perform one last hit to pay for her treatment.

After the financial backing from Hark became problematic following the release of Woo&#x27;s film &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot;, Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun-fat&#x27;s and Danny Lee&#x27;s financing companies. Woo went into filming &quot;The Killer&quot; with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films &quot;Le Samouraï&quot;, &quot;Mean Streets&quot; and &quot;Narazumono&quot;. Woo wanted to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to &quot;The Killer&quot; as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese.

&quot;The Killer&quot; was not an immediate success in Hong Kong but received critical acclaim internationally with reviewers praising its action scenes and over-the-top style. The film became Woo&#x27;s steppingstone into Hollywood and has been a strong influence on many directors, including Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Johnnie To. In the years since, &quot;The Killer&quot; has come to be considered one of the greatest action films ever made. An English-language remake of the film, also directed by Woo, was released in August 2024.

== Plot ==
Ah Jong, a hitman, decides to retire after one final job. During a shootout with gangsters, he accidentally blinds a young nightclub singer named Jennie when his gun fires too close to her eyes. Over the next six months, he quietly watches over her, attending all of her performances. One night, he intervenes to save her from being mugged and assaulted; Jennie then invites him into her apartment. They grow close and begin a relationship. However, Jennie then learns from her doctor that if she does not undergo a corneal transplant, she will lose what remains of her sight. Ah Jong agrees to kill a high-ranking triad boss to pay for the operation. 

Meanwhile, Detective Li Ying performs a botched undercover sting but is scolded and demoted by his superior for shooting his enemy inside the tram and unintentionally causing the fatal heart attack of a hostage. Li later spots Ah Jong in the middle of the hit on the Triad boss, but eventually loses him. Ah Jong&#x27;s client, Wong Hoi, betrays him by sending hitmen to kill Ah Jong at the location of his getaway car. Ah Jong guns down the hitmen, but a child is badly injured in the crossfire. Ah Jong rushes the child to a nearby hospital while being followed by Li and his partner, Sgt. Tsang Yeh. Ah Jong holds Yeh at gunpoint until the child regains consciousness, then escapes from the police. Li becomes obsessed with Ah Jong&#x27;s act of goodwill. He and Tsang learn about Jennie; when Ah Jong visits her, he manages to outwit and elude the two cops once again. 

Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his manager, Fung Sei, and demands the money he was promised for his last job. Sei betrays him by giving him a briefcase of blank notes and sends hitmen to take down Ah Jong in his own home. Ah Jong kills his attackers, but spares Sei out of loyalty. The next day, Ah Jong attempts to kill Wong Hoi in a drive-by shooting but fails. Wong Hoi hires hitman Frank Chen, to kill Ah Jong. Jennie is persuaded to help the police set a trap for Ah Jong at the airport, but Sei distracts them while Ah Jong flees with Jennie. Tsang follows Sei to his house, where Ah Jong and Jennie are hiding, but gets fatally wounded by Chen&#x27;s gang and dies in the hospital moments after sharing his discovery with Li. 

Li goes to arrest Ah Jong, but winds up helping him, and Jennie fight their way out of an ambush. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong&#x27;s wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong makes Li promise that should anything happen to him, he will make sure that Jennie has her operation. Li, Ah Jong, and Jennie take refuge in a church while Sei goes to get Ah Jong&#x27;s money from Hoi. He is badly beaten after trying to shoot Hoi and sustains several mortal gunshot wounds, but manages to get the money to the church. Ah Jong shoots Sei to end his suffering, and he and Li arm themselves before engaging in a bloody shootout with dozens of gangsters. 

Li and Ah Jong are wounded, and eventually find themselves in a Mexican standoff between Ah Jong, Li, and Hoi. Hoi holds a gun to Jennie&#x27;s head and shoots Chen dead when Li takes him hostage. Ah Jong has his eyes shot out, and bleeds to death as Jennie, now completely blind, crawls around helplessly trying to find him. As the police arrive, Hoi immediately surrenders, but an enraged Li kills him promptly during the process of his arrest. In the end, for disobeying the law by murdering Hoi even after he had surrendered, Li is surrounded by the police, and collapses to the ground in despair at the loss of his friend.

==Themes== 
Director John Woo has described &quot;The Killer&quot; as being about &quot;honour and friendship&quot;, &quot;trying to find out if there is something common between two people&quot; and as a &quot;romantic poem&quot;. The structure of the film follows two men on opposite sides of the law who find a relation to each other in their opposition to a greater evil, Wong Hoi, a Triad boss. Li and Ah Jong&#x27;s relationship was influenced by the &quot;Spy vs. Spy&quot; comics from &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;. Woo recalled &quot;When I was young I was fascinated with the cartoon–I love it very much ... the white bird and the black bird are always against each other, but deep in their heart, they are still friendly, and the idea came from that.&quot; Woo uses Ah Jong and Li as a central motif to illustrate moral points. Scenes with this reflective doubling include the hospital sequence with Li and Ah Jong on opposite sides of a hospital hall and in the final battle scene where Li and Ah Jong are in a standoff with Wong. The focus on male friendships in Woo&#x27;s film have been interpreted as homoerotic. Woo has responded to these statements stating &quot;People will bring their own preconceptions to a movie ... If they see something in &quot;The Killer&quot; that they consider to be homoerotic then that is their privilege. It&#x27;s certainly not intentional.&quot;
Woo is a Christian and instills his films with religious imagery while stating that &quot;The Killer&quot; is &quot;not a religious film&quot;. In the opening of &quot;The Killer&quot;, Ah Jong is found in a church stating he enjoys the &quot;tranquility&quot;. Ah Jong is later found in the church again getting several slugs pulled out of his back showing his intense pain while the altar and cross are shown prominently behind him. The idea was influenced by Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;Mean Streets&quot;, Woo stated the imagery was used to show that &quot;God is welcoming, no matter if it&#x27;s a good or a bad man, everyone is welcome&quot;.

Woo draws on animal symbolism throughout the film. He filled the church with doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent the spirits of the people. This was the first film in which Woo used the dove symbolism that he would later use for a similar effect in &quot;Hard Target&quot; and &quot;Face/Off&quot;. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li&#x27;s partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie&#x27;s apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.

== Production ==

=== Pre-production ===

&quot;The Killer&quot; was director Woo&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot; which was released in 1987. The first cut of &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot; was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo. According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot; and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo&#x27;s new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; and &quot;Once a Thief&quot;.
When Woo proposed the story of &quot;The Killer&quot; to Tsui Hark, it was denied; Hark&#x27;s reaction was that &quot;[n]obody wants to see a film about a killer&quot;.

=== Casting ===
&quot;The Killer&quot; was not able to be filmed until actor Chow Yun-fat stepped in and enlisted the company he was contracted with, Golden Princess Film, to fund part of the project. Chow had worked previously with Woo on the two &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; films. Woo wanted Danny Lee to play Li Ying, but Lee was under an exclusive contract with Cinema City and was only able to work on &quot;The Killer&quot; if his production company, Magnum, was involved. John Woo approached his friend, Sally Yeh, asking her to be in a film to play an important female character. Yeh was currently contracted with Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance. The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director. Chu Kong was a friend of Chow Yun-fat who had entered retirement and returned to acting in &quot;The Killer&quot; as a favor. Two of Woo&#x27;s close friends joined the cast: actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong. Wong Wing-Hang was hired to be the director of photography for &quot;The Killer&quot; but had to leave the set for an extended period of time, so Peter Pau was added to shoot the rest of the film.

=== Filming ===

Woo had over 90 days to shoot &quot;The Killer&quot; which was nearly double the amount of time that the average Hong Kong film was shot in the late 1980s. Woo went into filming with only a short treatment for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming. During promotion periods for the film, Woo described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean-Pierre Melville. Woo cites Melville&#x27;s &quot;Le Samouraï&quot; as an influence on the story. Woo borrows plot elements for the film, including the set-up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer. Woo also described the influence of a Japanese film, &quot;&quot;, about a killer (Ken Takakura) who only kills delinquents. When a mob tricks him into killing an innocent person, he swears revenge but then meets a woman who has tuberculosis and wants to go home. The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge.

The scene where Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay and the crew only had three hours to film. Residents thought it was a real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the superintendent so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase, but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong&#x27;s character&#x27;s house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach, but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong&#x27;s apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh&#x27;s tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.

== Music ==
Tsui and Woo disagreed on the musical aspects of the film. For the opening scene, Woo wanted the singer to perform a jazz song and have the killer playing a saxophone. Tsui rejected this idea as he felt that the Hong Kong audiences did not understand or like jazz. Woo stated that he &quot;had to change it to a Chinese song, the kind of song they always use in Hong Kong movies.&quot; Actress Sally Yeh who performed the Cantopop songs did not feel they were appropriate for the film. The songs were requested by the studio and written specifically for &quot;The Killer&quot;.

The film&#x27;s music was composed by Lowell Lo and edited by David Wu. A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting vibraphone theme which is first heard over the opening credits. The harmonica motif in the film was influenced by the soundtracks of Ennio Morricone, specifically the soundtrack to &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect. David Wu said the influence of the Harmonica music in Sergio Leone&#x27;s western films was a strong influence on his work. During the final action scene when the statue of the Virgin Mary is destroyed, the action music transitions to &quot;Overture&quot; from &quot;Messiah&quot; by George Frideric Handel. This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence.

== Release ==

&quot;The Killer&quot; was first released in Taiwan in March 1989 with a running time of 124 minutes. It was then cut to its current running time of 110 minutes and released in Hong Kong on 6 July 1989, Woo felt this cut was &quot;much better&quot;. The film was not an immediate success in Hong Kong due to the Tiananmen Square massacre but eventually gained fame, grossing $18,255,083 and reached ninth at the 1989 Hong Kong box office. At the 9th Hong Kong Film Awards, the film won for Best Director (John Woo) and Best Editing (Fan Kung Ming) and was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (Paul Chu Kong), Best Screenplay (Woo) and Best Cinematography (Wong Wing Hang and Peter Pau). &quot;The Killer&quot; was popular in Korea taking seventh highest place in the year end box office receipts.

&quot;The Killer&quot; was shown at several film festivals outside Asia including the 1989 Toronto Festival of Festivals and, during the film&#x27;s United States premiere, at the Palm Springs International Film Festival in January 1990. It was also shown at the Sundance Film Festival in the United States and the Cannes Film Festival in France in 1990. Film producer Terence Chang suggested that &quot;The Killer&quot;&#x27;s success around the world made several Hong Kong filmmakers jealous: &quot;It created a certain kind of resentment in the Hong Kong film industry. One thing I can say for sure is, the American, European, Japanese, Korean and even the Taiwanese audiences and critics appreciated &quot;The Killer&quot; a lot more than it was in Hong Kong.&quot; &quot;The Killer&quot; received a wide release in the United Kingdom on 8 October 1993.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Killer&quot; was released in the United States on VHS by Fox Lorber in November 1992, in a dubbed and subtitled version. On 25 June 1996 Fox Lorber released &quot;The Killer&quot; along with &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; as a double feature on home video. &quot;The Killer&quot; was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection on 1 April 1998 in the original Cantonese language track with English subtitles. Bonus features on DVD included the trailer, production notes, and a commentary track. Woo was very happy with the film being included in the Criterion Collection stating, &quot;it was great because it would let people know what [&quot;The Killer&quot; and &quot;Hard Boiled&quot;] are about...when I saw that Criterion Collection selected &quot;The Killer&quot;, I was very happy as &quot;The Killer&quot; and &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; are my two favourites&quot;.

On 3 Oct 2000 Fox Lorber released a DVD of &quot;The Killer&quot;. This Fox Lorber disc was also included in a two disc DVD collection with &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; but both the Fox Lorber and Criterion DVDs went out of print.

On 30 March 2010 &quot;The Killer&quot; was released by the Dragon Dynasty label on two-disc DVD and Blu-ray.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Killer&quot; was released on DVD by Hong Kong Legends on 21 October 2002 which included an audio commentary with Bey Logan and interviews with Kenneth Tsang, Sally Yeh and cinematographer Peter Pau.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 95% based on 43 reviews by critics, with and average rating of 8.7/10. Its critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Killer&quot; is another hard-boiled action flick from John Woo featuring eye-popping balletic violence and philosophical underpinnings.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the film as &quot;Alternately gripping and laughable&quot; and that &quot;The scenes of gore and destruction are even more spectacular than Hong Kong&#x27;s fog-shrouded skyline&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; gave a positive review, describing the film as an &quot;extremely violent and superbly made actioner demonstrates the tight grasp that director John Woo has on the crime meller genre&quot;. Kathleen Maher of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; praised the film stating that it &quot;defies all categorization but demands comparisons, if only to prove that there&#x27;s never been anything like this before.&quot; Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote a positive review, describing the film as &quot;like eating popcorn, but it&#x27;s not just any old brand; it&#x27;s escape-velocity popcorn, popcorn with a slurp of rocket fuel...[Woo&#x27;s] ideas overreach themselves with such a virile swagger that they border on comedy. With excess like this you can&#x27;t help but laugh. This is a rush of a movie&quot;.

Later critiques of the film remained positive. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that &quot;the plot doesn&#x27;t exactly break new crime-story ground. It&#x27;s all the Woo flourishes...that elevates &quot;The Killer&quot; to another level&quot;. Lucia Bozzola of the online film database Allmovie gave the film a five star rating, and stated it as &quot;One of the high points of 1980s Hong Kong action cinema&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film five stars and proclaimed that &quot;John Woo&#x27;s trademark style reached its zenith in The Killer&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Time Out New York&quot; ranked &quot;The Killer&quot; at number 50 on their list of the top 50 foreign films of all time. In 2014, &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. &quot;The Killer&quot; was listed at 24th place on this list.

=== Legacy ===

&quot;The Killer&quot; has been recognized as an important and influential film for both Western and Asian filmmakers. Film scholars have noted the similarities between Woo&#x27;s style and &quot;The Killer&quot; with the films &quot;Nikita&quot; (1990) and &quot;Léon&quot; (1994) directed by French director Luc Besson. Kenneth E. Hall described &quot;Léon&quot; as having the similar character configuration of a hitman and the person he protects. In &quot;Nikita&quot;, the main character&#x27;s crisis of conscience after performing a number of hits is also seen in &quot;The Killer&quot;. Lucy Mazdon described the style of &quot;Nikita&quot; as recalling &quot;the work of directors like John Woo. Like &quot;Nikita&quot;, Woo&#x27;s films show alienated and often brutal characters and graphic violence&quot;. Brandon Lee used &quot;The Killer&quot; as an influence when choreographing his fight scenes in the film &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;. In the United States, directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino developed films that were influenced by &quot;The Killer&quot;. Rodriguez&#x27;s films &quot;El Mariachi&quot; (1992), &quot;Desperado&quot; (1995), &amp; &quot;Once Upon a Time in Mexico&quot; (2003) contain stylistic homages to &quot;The Killer&quot;. In writing the script for &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, Tarantino added dialog referencing &quot;The Killer&quot; that were not present in the source novel. Asian-based directors were also influenced by the film. Hong Kong director Johnnie To borrows from &quot;The Killer&quot;&#x27;s gunfighting style, oppositional character pairing, and parody in his films &quot;A Hero Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Running Out of Time&quot;, and &quot;Fulltime Killer&quot;.

&quot;The Killer&quot; was also influential on hip hop music. American hip hop artist, and Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon released his critically praised debut album &quot;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&quot; (1995) that sampled numerous portions of dialog from the film. RZA, the producer of the album described the album&#x27;s themes by stating that &quot;Rae and Ghost was two opposite guys as far as neighborhoods was concerned, I used John Woo&#x27;s &quot;The Killer&quot;. [In that movie] you got Chow Yun Fat [playing the role of Ah Jong] and Danny Lee [Inspector Li]. They have to become partners to work shit out.&quot; Woo felt honored that the group sampled &quot;The Killer&quot; and asked for no monetary return from them. In 2005, &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine placed &quot;The Killer&quot; at number 21 on their list of top fifty films that shaped hip hop.

==Accolades==
== Remake ==

In 1992, American filmmaker Walter Hill and David Giler wrote a screenplay for Tri-Star Pictures titled &quot;The Killer&quot; that was dated 6 April 1992. The press release of this remake stated the script was written for actors Richard Gere and Denzel Washington. In June 1992, it was announced Walter Hill and Giler were writing a script titled &quot;Hong Kong&quot; based on &quot;The Killer&quot; with Hill directing. The producers had difficulty with the relationship between two main characters in the script as they felt that American audiences would interpret it as a homoerotic one. Producer Terence Chang, who worked with Woo on several productions, suggested to the American producers to have Hong Kong actress Michelle Yeoh play the role of the police officer to resolve any homoerotic reading of the film. A year later, screenwriters Jim Cash and Jack Epps, Jr. were hired by producers Charles Roven and Robert Cavallo to write a screenplay based on &quot;The Killer&quot; for Tristar, in which they wrote a third draft of the script was that was dated on 23 August 1993 which featured a story of a Caucasian hitman living in Hong Kong. This screenplay moved the focus from the pairing the hit man and the police detective characters to the characters of blinded night club singer and the hit man.

In October 2007, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; announced that a remake of &quot;The Killer&quot; was announced with Korean-American director John H. Lee directing. The remake would take place in Los Angeles&#x27;s Koreatown, Chinatown, and South Central. Lee named &quot;The Killer&quot; as one of his favorite films and that he was excited to make his own version of the film. Lee&#x27;s version was set to be produced by Woo, and star Jung Woo-sung and shot in 3D. Seven Stars Film Studios was slated to finance the production with a screenplay by Josh Campbell. Sarah Li was initially cast to play the role of the blind singer. Woo spoke about the remake in October 2015, stating that Lee&#x27;s film was in development for some time and Lee eventually took on other projects.

Woo commented in 2015 that he would return to Hollywood after filming &quot;Manhunt&quot; (2017) in order to make an American adaptation of &quot;The Killer&quot;. Universal Pictures was announced to be developing the film with a script written by Eran Creevy based on drafts by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken, with additional contributions by Brian Helgeland. Actress Lupita Nyong&#x27;o had been cast for the lead role. Woo said that filming would begin in January 2019. About the decision of flip both the gender and race of the lead, Nyong&#x27;o remarked that she &quot;did not see it coming, either&quot;, stating that she had received, read and liked the script without having seen the original movie. However, Woo told &quot;Deadline&quot; in November 2019 that Nyong&#x27;o had left the film due to scheduling conflicts as a result of a script rewrite. In May 2022, it was announced that the film will be directed by Woo, produced by Universal and released exclusively on Peacock. In August 2022, Universal announced that Omar Sy would lead the film as the cop character. In March 2023, Nathalie Emmanuel was cast as the lead role. Woo returned to work on &quot;The Killer&quot; following a multi-month hiatus on shooting the film in Paris shoot due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. The film was released on August 23, 2024.

<doc id="451883" wikidata="Q622310" url="?curid=451883" title="Heroic bloodshed">
<text>Heroic bloodshed is a genre invented by Hong Kong action cinema revolving around stylized action sequences and dramatic themes, such as brotherhood, duty, honour, redemption, and violence that has become a popular genre used by different directors worldwide. The term &quot;heroic bloodshed&quot; was coined by editor Rick Baker in the magazine &quot;Eastern Heroes&quot; in the late 1980s, specifically referring to the styles of directors John Woo and Ringo Lam. Baker defined the genre as &quot;a Hong Kong action film that features a lot of gun play and gangsters rather than kung fu. Lots of blood. Lots of action.&quot; Heroic bloodshed films often feature gun fu action sequences.

==Motifs==

Protagonists in these films are often good-willed criminals, typically Triad members, hit men, or thieves with a strict code of ethics, which in some cases leads to the betrayal of their employers and the saving of many intended victims. The police officer with a conscience, who cannot be corrupted in any way, is also common, and is usually modeled after the hardboiled detective. Loyalty, family and brotherhood are the most typical themes of the genre. Heroic bloodshed films generally have a strong emotional angle, not only between, but during action sequences.

Pistols and submachine guns are frequently utilized by the heroes due to the light weight they provide, enabling their wielders to move more quickly. They are frequently dual wielded. The heroes are extremely agile and implement rolls, dives, slides, and falls while they duel, making for a graceful, ballet-like performance in the midst of gunfire.

Heroic bloodshed films often end on a downbeat or tragic note with the main heroes either dead, arrested by the police, or severely incapacitated.

==History==
John Woo&#x27;s breakthrough film &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1986) largely set the template for the heroic bloodshed genre. In turn, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; was a reimagining of plot elements from two earlier Hong Kong crime films: Lung Kong&#x27;s &quot;The Story of a Discharged Prisoner&quot; (1967) and the Shaw Brothers Studio film &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1979), the latter a remake of the hit Indian crime drama film &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) written by Salim–Javed.

Woo has also been a major influence in its continued popularity and evolution in his following works, namely &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot; (1987), &quot;The Killer&quot; (1989) and &quot;Hard Boiled&quot; (1992).

The heroic bloodshed genre had a considerable impact on world cinema, especially Hollywood. The action, style, tropes and mannerisms established in 1980s Hong Kong heroic bloodshed films were later widely adopted by American cinema in the 1990s, reshaping the way action films were made in the Western world. Lam&#x27;s &quot;City on Fire&quot; (1987) inspired Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992); Tarantino was an admirer of the genre. &quot;The Killer&quot; also heavily influenced Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;Léon: The Professional&quot; (1994) from France. Eventually, John Woo himself introduced his brand of heroic bloodshed in the United States. By the end of the 20th century, Woo&#x27;s style of cinema had become firmly established in Hollywood.

<text>The Indian Police Service ( IPS) is a civil service under the All India Services. It replaced the Indian Imperial Police in 1948, a year after India became independent from the British Empire.

Along with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and the Indian Forest Service (IFS), the IPS is part of the All India Services – its officers are employed by both the Union Government and by individual states.

The service provides leadership to various state and central police forces, including the Central Armed Police Forces (BSF, SSB, CRPF, CISF, and ITBP), the National Security Guard (NSG), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), Special Protection Group (SPG), National Investigation Agency (NIA), and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

==History==
=== Indian Imperial Police ===
In 1861, the Parliament of the United Kingdom introduced the &quot;Indian Councils Act, 1861&quot;. The act created the foundation of a modern and professional police bureaucracy in India. It introduced a new cadre of police, called Superior Police Services, later known as the Indian Imperial Police. The highest rank in the service was the inspector general for each province. The rank of inspector general was equated to that of a brigadier, and similar ranks in the Indian Armed Forces, as per a central warrant of precedence issued in 1937.

In 1902–1903, a police commission was established to recommend reforms under Sir Andrew Fraser and Lord Curzon. It recommended the appointment of Indians as officers in the police. Previously, Indians could rise only to the rank of an inspector, the senior N.C.O. position. However they were not part of the Indian Imperial Police.

From 1920 onward, the Indian Imperial Police was open to Indians and the entrance examination for the service was conducted both in India and England.
Prior to Independence, senior police officers belonging to the Imperial Police (IP) were appointed by the secretary of state on the basis of a competitive examination. The first open civil service examination for admittance to the service was held in England in June 1893 and the ten top candidates were appointed as probationers in the Indian Imperial Police. It is not possible to identify an exact date for when the Indian Police Service came formally into being.

Around 1907, the secretary of state&#x27;s officers were directed to wear the letters &quot;IP&quot; on their epaulettes in order to distinguish them from other officers not recruited by the secretary through examination. Therefore, 1907 could be regarded as the starting point for the IPS. In 1948, a year after India gained independence; the Imperial Police was formally replaced by the Indian Police Service.

=== Indian Police Service ===
The Indian Police Service was created under &quot;Article 312(2), XIV of the Constitution of India.&quot;

As per media reports, there is a massive shortage of IPS officers in India, amounting to nearly 19% to 22% of the sanctioned strength.

====Medals and decorations====

Despite having a very small cadre strength, many IPS officers have been awarded the highest gallantry awards (Ashok Chakra, Kirti Chakra). The current national security advisor of India, Ajit Doval, was an IPS officer who earned the Kirti Chakra for his gallant actions during operation Black Thunder. Though generally deployed in supervisory roles at senior levels, it is not uncommon for IPS officers to be in the field taking active part in maintaining law and order. IPS officers have been posted to various UN Missions and several have been awarded the United Nations Medal. Many exceptional IPS officers have been awarded with Padma awards from time to time.

==Objective==
The First Police Commission, appointed on 17 August 1865, contained detailed guidelines for the desired system of police in India and defined the police as a governmental department to enforce the law, maintain order and to detect and prevent crime across the region. The Indian Police Service is not a force but a service providing leaders and commanders to staff the state police and all-India Central Armed Police Forces. Its members are the senior officers of the police. With time Indian Police Service&#x27;s objectives were updated and redefined, the current roles and functions of an Indian Police Service Officer are as follows:

* To fulfil duties based on border responsibilities, in the areas of maintenance of public peace and order, crime prevention, investigation, and detection, collection of intelligence, VIP security, Counterterrorism, border policing, railway policing, tackling smuggling, drug trafficking, economic offenses, corruption in public life, emergency management, enforcement of Socioeconomics legislation, Biodiversity and protection of environmental laws, etc.
* Leading and commanding the Indian Intelligence Agencies like Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), Intelligence Bureau (IB), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Criminal Investigation Department (CID) etc., Indian Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, Civil and Armed Police Forces in all the states and union territories.
* Led and commanded various Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) which include the Central Police Organisations (CPO) such as Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), National Security Guard (NSG), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Vigilance Organisations and Indian Federal Law Enforcement Agencies.
* To lead and command the force with courage, uprightness, dedication and a strong sense of service to the people.
* Endeavor to teach in the police forces under their command such values and norms as would help them serve the people better.
* Inculcate integrity of the highest order, sensitivity to people&#x27;s aspirations in a fast-changing social and economic milieu, respect for human rights, the broad liberal perspective of law and justice, and a high standard of professionalism.

==Selection==

IPS officers are recruited from Civil Services Examination conducted by UPSC. They are also promoted from State Police Services and DANIPS. However, at present, recruitment from Limited Competitive Examination has been put on hold.

===Training===
The training of IPS officer recruits is conducted at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad. The authorized cadre strength of the Indian Police Service is 4920. (3270 Direct Recruitment Posts and 1650 Promotional Posts). The Civil List of IPS officers is an updated (annual) list maintained by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India that lists the posting details of all IPS officers in India. This Civil List can be accessed from the MHA website. It allows searching for an IPS officer based on their name, Batch, or Cadre.

After completion of almost 2 years training, IPS probationers are awarded a master&#x27;s degree in criminal justice management from NALSAR University of Law.

=== State cadres ===

==== Cadre allocation policy ====
The Union Government announced a new cadre allocation policy for the All India Services in August 2017, touting it as a policy to ensure national integration of the bureaucracy as officers and ensure the All-India character of the services. Under the new policy, the existing 26 cadres have been divided into five zones in the new policy by the Department of Personnel and Training of Government of India.

Under the new policy, a candidate has to first give their choice in the descending order of preference from amongst the various Zones. Subsequently, the candidate has to indicate one preference of cadre from each preferred zone. The candidate indicates their second cadre preference for every preferred zone subsequently. The process continues till a preference for all the cadres is indicated by the candidate. The preference for the zones/cadres remains in the same order and no change is permitted.

Officers continue to work in the cadre they are allotted or are deputed to the Government of India.
==== Old cadre allocation policies ====
Till 2008 there was no system of preference of state cadre by the candidates; the candidates, if not placed in the insider vacancy of their home states, were allotted to different states in alphabetical order of the roster, beginning with the letters A, H, M, T for that particular year. For example, if in a particular year, the roster begins from &#x27;A&#x27;, which means the first candidate on the roster will go to the Andhra Pradesh state cadre of IPS, the next one to Bihar, and subsequently to Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, and so on in alphabetical order. The next year the roster starts from &#x27;H&#x27;, for either Haryana or Himachal Pradesh (if it has started from Haryana on the previous occasion when it all started from &#x27;H&#x27;, then this time it would start from Himachal Pradesh). This highly intricate system, in vogue since the mid-1980s, had ensured that officers from different states were placed all over India.

The system of permanent state cadres has also resulted in wide disparities in the kind of professional exposure for officers when we compare officers in small and big and also developed and backward states. Changes of state cadre are permitted on grounds of marriage to an All India Service officer of another state cadre or under other exceptional circumstances. The officer may go to their home state cadre on deputation for a limited period, after which one has to invariably return to the cadre allotted to him or her.

From 2008 to 2017 IPS officers were allotted to state cadres at the beginning of their service. There was one cadre for each Indian state, except for two joint cadres: Assam–Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh–Goa–Mizoram–Union Territories (AGMUT). The &quot;insider-outsider ratio&quot; (ratio of officers who were posted in their home states) is maintained as 1:2, with one-third of the direct recruits as &#x27;insiders&#x27; from the same state. The rest were posted as outsiders according to the &#x27;roster&#x27; in states other than their home states, as per their preference.

==Career progression==

===Pay structure of Indian Police Service===
===Ranks and insignia===

Though the standard uniform colour is khaki, the ranks, posts and designations of IPS officers vary from state to state as law and order is a federalism in India. But generally the following pattern is observed.

====IPS officers Ranks====
IPS officers are appointed on the basis of either Civil Service Examination or promoted from the state police service cadre &quot;(state civil service officers)&quot;. Vacancy in an IPS cadre are determined on the basis of vacancy on an Superintendent of Police rank. Consequently, there are two level of gradations for SP rank. These are level 11 and 12 as per the Seventh Pay Commission. Resultantly, IPS officers remain on the rank on SP till the 13th year after which they are eligible for being promoted as Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP). ASP rank is the junior most rank on an IPS state cadre. Consequently, fresh recruits to IPS are variously posted as Assistant Superintendent of Police in a supernumerary capacity (only for training purpose for two years and after that for 1 year) till they are formally placed as Superintendent of Police In-Charge of an area (when they get the pay of level 11 and level 12) and as district in charge (when they get the pay of level 12) (only in non-metropolitan districts). When the officers get promoted to the rank of SSP, some of them are posted as the district in-charge of metropolitan districts.


==Reform committees==
&lt;section begin=&quot;Reform committees&quot;/&gt; 
India&#x27;s police continue to be governed by a colonial police law passed in 1861. The Indian Constitution makes policing a state subject and therefore the state governments have the responsibility to provide their communities with a police service. However, after independence, most have adopted the 1861 Act without change, while others have passed laws heavily based on the 1861 Act.

Repeated major incidents, like the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder, 2020 Hathras gang rape and murder, as well as terrorist attacks such as the 2008 Mumbai attacks revealed the failure of the police to uphold the rule of law.

The need for police reform in India has long been recognised. There have been almost 30 years of debate and discussion by government-created committees and commissions on the way forward for police reform, but India remains saddled with an outdated and old-fashioned law, while report after report gathers dust on government bookshelves without implementation. Many committees on police reform have recommended major reforms in the police system coupled with systematic accountability.

=== National Police Commission (1977–81) ===
The National Police Commission was the first committee set up by the Government of India to report on policing. The National Police Commission began sitting in 1979, in the context of a post-Emergency India, and produced eight reports, including a Model Police Act, between 1979 and 1981.

=== Ribeiro Committee (1998–99) ===

In 1996, two former senior police officers filed a Public interest litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court, asking for the Court to direct governments to implement the recommendations of the National Police Commission. The Supreme Court directed the government to set up a committee to review the commission&#x27;s recommendations, and thus the Ribeiro Committee was formed. The committee, under the leadership of Julio Ribeiro, a former chief of police, sat over 1998 and 1999, and produced two reports.

=== Padmanabhaiah Committee (2000) ===
In 2000, the government set up a third committee on police reform, this time under the stewardship of a former union home secretary, K. Padmanabhaiah. This Committee released its report in the same year.

=== Malimath Committee Report (2003) ===
The Malimath Committee Report submitted in March 2003 has very articulately laid down the foundation of a restructured and reoriented police system. The committee in its report observed that the success of the whole process of Criminal Justice Administration depended completely on the proper functioning of the police organisation especially in the investigation stage. Apart from the investigation of offences, the police also have the duty of maintaining law and order.

=== Soli Sorabjee Committee (2005) ===
In 2005, the government put together a group to draft a new police act for India. It was headed by Soli Sorabjee (former attorney general). The committee submitted a Model Police Act to the union government in late 2006.

=== Supreme Court intervention (2006) ===
In 1996, Prakash Singh (a former chief of Assam Police and Uttar Pradesh Police and subsequently Director General of the Border Security Force) initiated a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court of India, asking the court to investigate measures to reform the police forces across India to ensure the proper rule of law and improve security across India. The Supreme Court studied various reports on police reforms. Finally, in 2006, a bench of Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal, Justice C. K. Thakker and Justice P.K. Balasubramanyan ordered the state governments to implement several reforms in police force.

Several measures were identified as necessary to professionalise the police in India:

* A mid or high ranking police officer must not be transferred more frequently than every two years.
* The state government cannot ask the police force to hire someone, nor can they choose the Director General of the State Police.
* There must be separate departments and staff for investigation and patrolling, which will include the creation of:
** A &quot;State Security Commission&quot;, for policies and direction
** A &quot;Police Establishment Board&quot;, which will decide the selection, promotions and transfers of police officers and other staff
** A &quot;Police Complaints Authority&quot;, to inquire into allegations of police misconduct.

====Follow-up from Supreme Court====
In 2006, due to a lack of action by all the state governments, the Supreme Court ordered the state governments to report to it why the reform measures outlined were not implemented. After being questioned in front of the judges of the Supreme Court, the state governments finally started to reform the police forces and give them the operational independence they need for fearless and proper law enforcement. Tamil Nadu Police has been in the forefront of application of the new referendum.

Again, in October 2012, a Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice Altamas Kabir and justices S. S. Nijjar and Jasti Chelameswar asked all state governments and Union territories to inform about compliance of its September 2006 judgement. The order was passed when Prakash Singh through his lawyer Prashant Bhushan said that many of the reforms (ordered by the Supreme Court) have yet not been implemented by many state governments.

== Major concerns and public debates ==
Due to the immense amount of power and responsibility that IPS officers hold, many issues occur when personal beliefs, desires, emotions, safety, and security are at play.

===Politicization &amp; political interference===
One of the primary concerns is the issue of politicization. The police force is often subject to political interference, which can undermine its independence and impartiality. Political pressure can influence the decision-making process, compromise investigations, and create a lack of trust in the police among the public. The ambition of the senior IPS officers to occupy posts of importance is a major contributory factor to the politicization. The appointment of subordinate police officers is in the hands of their seniors. When the seniors surrender their authority by complying with requests from politicians, corruption increases, and the investigation of crime in sensitive cases is based not on facts and law but on the wishes and interests of the politician in power.

Members of one of the two most elite services in the country (the other being the Indian Administrative Service), IPS officers are arguably the most visible face of the government, overseeing law and order, investigation, internal and border security, and intelligence, among other functions. IPS officers often encounter political interference in their day-to-day functioning. Politicians may attempt to influence police investigations, transfers, and postings for their interests or to fulfill political agendas. Such interference can undermine the impartiality and integrity of the police force.

Despite demands from the citizens, political leaders in power have often ignored in implementing police reforms, which often allows leadership to influence investigations, especially on cases against them. The Police Act of 1861, which is still in use, has not been replaced despite protests and demands, as the colonial era Police Law allows political interference in law enforcement and investigations, along with targeting opposing leaders and citizens who criticize or protest against them.

=== Corruption ===
Some IPS officers have been accused of public corruption, money laundering, drug trafficking, and unjust use of power. There have been various instances of abuse of the public by officers. High-ranking officers often enjoy many luxuries for no cost. There is also opportunity to receive extra payment for doing specific tasks on the job.

=== VIP Culture ===
VIP culture within the Indian Police Service (IPS) refers to a phenomenon where certain individuals, especially those holding positions of power or influence, receive preferential treatment or special privileges from the police force. This culture often results in the diversion of police resources and manpower towards catering to the needs and demands of these individuals, often at the expense of the general public.
VIP culture in India, including within the IPS, has been a subject of criticism and public debate for many years. It is seen as a reflection of the country&#x27;s broader issue of social and political inequality. One manifestation of VIP culture within the IPS is the deployment of police personnel for personal security and escort duties even their personal needs for senior IPS officers. These personnel are often diverted from their regular law enforcement duties, which can affect the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the police force. VIP culture also extends to the use of special privileges such as flashing red or blue beacons on vehicles, known as &quot;lal batti,&quot; which signify authority and grant the right-of-way on the roads. The practice of using sirens and escort vehicles to navigate through traffic, often at high speeds, is another common aspect of VIP culture within the IPS. 
* Security - High-ranking IPS officials are provided with a significant security detail, which includes armed police personnel, vehicles, and sometimes even dedicated security units. This leads to the concentration of resources on protecting VIPs, sometimes at the expense of maintaining law and order in other areas.

===Abuse of Power===
There are a lot of incidents were Misuse of Power by IPS officers in India. In a notable incident in Kochi, there was an alarming misuse of government vehicles and police personnel during the marriage ceremony of an IPS officer. This incident raised concerns as several government-owned vehicles, belonging to the Kerala police, were utilized as a shuttle service for the wedding festivities. Additionally, some police officers were deployed as valets to assist with carrying luggage and other items for the guests. This incident highlights a misuse of power and resources, which is a matter of great concern. Such actions not only demonstrate a disregard for the proper usage of government assets but also raise questions regarding the principles of fairness and equality.

===Custodial torture and Extra-judicial killings===
In June 2023, an incident of alleged abuse of power by a Tamil Nadu IPS officer came to light, resulting in his suspension. an assistant superintendent of police (ASP) from the Tamil Nadu cadre, was accused of engaging in custodial torture at Ambasamudram police station in Tirunelveli district. The allegations against the IPS officer included forcefully extracting the teeth of approximately ten individuals and repeatedly assaulting at least two of them in their genital areas while they were in custody.

===Fake encounters===
Some IPS officers have been convicted of fake encounters, a term for extrajudicial killings by the police supposedly in self-defense.

===Mental health and suicide===
IPS officers have complained of high levels of stress due to long work hours and unrealistic demands of political bosses. Retired Director General of Police in Uttar Pradesh Vikram Singh believes job discontent is a combination of &quot;no holidays, lack of sleep, the sinking feeling of failure, public treatment of policemen with contempt, the indifference of political bosses and almost no connect with superiors&quot;. Professional stress ruins personal lives and leads to marital discord. The inability to balance professional and personal lives has led some IPS officers to commit suicide.

=== Moral Policing ===
The Indian Police Service officials have been criticized for acts of moral policing. Using sections 292 to 294 of the Indian Penal Code which are used to deal with obscenity, Police officers have often harassed citizens for several incidents such as celebrating Valentine&#x27;s Day, indulging in Public Displays of Affection, and arresting consenting couples in private places. Following increasing incidents of such misconducts, the Supreme Court passed an order nationwide in December 2022 to all Police Departments to stop moral policing.

=== IPS (Central) Association ===
In 2019, Ministry of Home Affairs said it never recognized or approved the formation of IPS (Central) Association, and the police force does not have the right to form any association without the permission of the federal Government of India.

===Entry reforms and Promotions===
The entry for the Police Service in India has been made up of 4 levels - constables, sub-inspectors, state service DSPs, and IPS. This has caused disunity in the force, with constables being treated as slaves or personal servants for senior officers. This type of police system has been severely criticized by several current and retired police officials, demanding a single entry into the force from constable, which has met resistance from other officials and political establishment.

Although the Indian Police Service norms mandate both merit-based and time-in-service promotion, even for the constable and inspector rank officers, it is not duly followed or implemented. This has caused constables to remain constables till retirement. Despite the norms, bureaucratic inefficiencies as well as nepotism prevent low-ranking officers from getting promotions, even if they get a pay raise to the next rank.

=== Low training standards and personnel shortage===
As of March 2023, India has a police-to-population of 153 personnel per 100,000 citizens, which is less than the sanctioned strength of 196 personnel, as well as way below the United Nations minimum requirement of 222 personnel per 100,000 citizens. The training has also fallen short of world standards, with the shortage of personnel causing investigations to suffer. These issues were previously noted in the aftermath of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Jaipur, Bangalore, and Ahmedabad.

=== Overworking and underpaid ===
The Indian Police Service has often faced the issues of being overworked, as well as underpaid. The 7th Pay Commission mandated a pay of Rs. 21,700 per month for constables, with the Director-General of Police having a pay of Rs. 225,000 per month. The pay for constables and inspector-ranked officers varies from state to state.

Due to a lack of shift system, many officers, especially the constable ranks were forced to work for more than 24 hours at a stretch, with no overtime pay. This affects the quality of the investigation as well as the morale of the officials on duty. Furthermore, the constabulary also does not get decent housing or any allowances for reasonable accommodation.

In May 2022, the Mumbai Police implemented an 8-hour shift system for the constable rank officers and assistant sub-inspectors, and 16 hours of rest. Following a lawsuit by a constable of the Delhi Police for demanding fixed working hours, proper housing, and reasonable pay in 2015, the Delhi High Court ordered senior officers of implementing better working conditions for constables in May 2023.

=== Violence against women and sexual misconduct ===
Some IPS officers have been implicated in cases of domestic violence, assaulting women, and sexual misconduct.

==Women in the Indian Police Service==
In 1972, Kiran Bedi became the first woman Indian Police Service officer and was the only woman in a batch of 80 IPS officers, she joined the AGMUT Cadre. She was followed by Jija Madhavan Harisingh in 1975, who became the first woman Indian Police Service officer from South-India (Karnataka cadre) and she remained in service for 36 years before retirement in 2011 as Director General of Police (DGP), and Kanchan Chaudhary Bhattacharya, the second woman IPS officer belonging to the 1973 Batch, becoming the first woman director general of police of a state in India when she was appointed DGP of Uttarakhand Police.

In 1992, Asha Sinha, a 1982 Batch IPS officer, became the first woman commandant in the paramilitary forces of India when she was posted as commandant, Central Industrial Security Force in Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and she remained in service for 34 years before retirement in 2016 as the director general of police (DGP). In 2018, an IPS officer Archana Ramasundaram of 1980 Batch became the first woman to become the director general of police of a Central Armed Police Force as DG, Sashastra Seema Bal.

In 2021, Kalpana Saxena replaced Yogesh Singh as the commandant of 47 battalion of PAC, Ghaziabad.

In 2023, Nina Singh became the director general of the Central Industrial Security Force.

<text>The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) is a central armed police force in India under the Ministry of Home Affairs. It is responsible for guarding India’s border with Tibet . It was formed in the aftermath of the Sino-Indian War of 1962.

==History==
The force was raised in first week of 1962 war with a strength of 4 battalions for collecting intelligence, fighting conventional and guerrilla warfare and improving Indian communication systems along the Chinese border. It was raised under the CRPF Act. They took part in the 1965 Indo Pakistani War as well as the Indo Pakistani war of 1971. In 1978 the force was reorganized with 9 service battalions, 4 specialist battalions and 2 training centres.

It provided security services for the 1982 Asian Games as well as 7th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement and the 1983 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

In 1987, 6 more battalions of ITBP were raised to stop bank robberies in the state of Punjab, in the final stages of the insurgency in Punjab.

In 1992, the ITBP was authorized under the new ITBP act, while it had previously been authorized under the CRPF Act. The rules of the ITBP act were framed in 1994.

From 1989 to 2004, the ITBP also had a minor presence in Jammu and Kashmir to combat the insurgency in Kashmir.

In 2004 the ITBP took over border patrol responsibilities for the entire 3,488 km long border, replacing the Assam Rifles in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.The ITBP previously worked in cooperation with the Assam Rifles for patrolling the border. This decision was made on the basis of recommendations made by a committee set up in the aftermath of the 1999 Kargil War under the principle of &quot;One Border, One Force&quot;.

== Organization ==
The i ITBP is divided into 2 commands which are headed by an Additional Director General of Police and 5 frontiers each headed by an Inspector General of Police (IG). These frontiers are further divided into 15 sectors each headed by a Deputy Inspector General (DIG).

It has 64 battalions (60 regular and 4 specialist), 17 training centres and 7 logistics establishments above 64 battalions include 2 rescue battalions which are deputed to the National Disaster Response Force.

== Roles ==
The primary role of the ITBP is to patrol the 3,488-km India-China border from the Karakoram Pass in Ladakh to Diphu La in Arunachal Pradesh,for which it has 32 battalions and 157 outposts. The border posts patrolled by ITBP are as high as 18,900 and vulnerable to high velocity storms, snow blizzards, avalanches, and landslides, besides the hazards of high altitude and extreme cold, where the temperature dips up to minus 40-degree Celsius. The ITBP conducts long and short range patrols to keep an effective vigil on the inaccessible and uninhabited areas located near the border.

Disaster rescue is the other major role of the ITBP. It is the first responder for natural disasters in the Himalayas and has 8 Regional Response Centres in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Northeast India.

The force has undertaken numerous mountaineering expeditions. Its skiers have been national champions, who have competed in Winter Olympics. Its river rafters have created international history in rafting through the turbulent white waters of the Brahmaputra, the Indus and the Ganges. The Force has created a milestone by becoming the first Central Paramilitary Force to win the Best Marching Contingent Trophy in the Republic Day parades in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2011. It broke new ground in 1998 when it sent the first-ever police tableau of the country to participate in the Republic Day Parade. ITBP is at the forefront of a movement for the preservation of Himalayan environment and ecology.

ITBP had provided a quarantine camp at Chhawala in New Delhi for potentially infected persons during the COVID-19 pandemic who were evacuated from Wuhan. It had also set up camps at its other locations in the country for further quarantine. It has also bee credited with running the world&#x27;s largest Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at SPCCC, Radha Soami Beas, Chhatarpur, New Delhi when it treated coronavirus patients during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in New Delhi.
ITBP has been involved in greening the Himalayan regions especially in Inner Himalayas. Being the only human presence in some areas close to China border, it has taken on itself the task of maintaining the delicate balance of flora and fauna.

ITBP has been involved in providing personal securities to VVIPs such as Murali Manohar Joshi, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti but Home Ministry is considering to withdraw it from protection duties.

===Training===
ITBPs major training centre is located at Mussoorie, in Uttarakhand. The Training Academy was established in 1976 and trains officers of the force. The training programme for Subordinate Officers of the force are conducted at Central Training College, Alwar and Basic Training College, Bhanu (Haryana). Specialised training programmes in rock craft, explosives handling etc. are also conducted here. Ace mountaineer and Padma Shri awardee, Harbhajan Singh, IG heads this institution. Keeping in view the evolving security scenario of the country, ITBP established a Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare (CIJW) School at an altitude of 6,000 feet in the heart of extremely tough Himalayan mountains, at Mahidanda in Uttarkashi district. The CIJW school (distinct from the premier CIJWS of the Indian Army) provides training to ITBP&#x27;s men and officers in anti-Naxal operations. Jungle warfare, handling of explosives, rock craft, survival in adverse conditions, unarmed combat, and guerrilla warfare are some of the subjects taught here. On account of demands for realistic anti-Naxal training the CIJW School of ITBP was shifted to Belgaum, Karnataka.
The training regime, formulated under the close supervision of Rajiv Mehta, IPS and executed on the ground by Sanjeev Raina, DIG is extremely demanding both mentally and physically, needing special preparation.
The presence of the force along the Indo-China border where it maintains vigil along the extremely difficult high altitude border area. The troops of the force keep a sharp eye on any violation of the border, trans-border smuggling, and affords a sense of security to the remotely located isolated settlements. The altitude where the troops are deployed range up to 18,800 feet and the temperature plummets to minus 30 degrees Celsius during winter with snowfall of more than ten feet.

The Himveers are taught to function effectively while always keeping in mind human rights and the codes of war which always guide their conduct.

The Basic Training Centre at Bhanu, Haryana; ITBP Academy at Mussourie and the Mountaineering &amp; Skiing Institute at Auli run the training programmes and conduct indoor and outdoor training activities, in pursuance of this mission.

ITBP is building a full-fledged recreation and training centre in Belgaum at Halbhavi. Belgaum provides the best climate for recreation and ITBP will relocate the personal and will have large family bases in Belgaum for its soldiers after high altitude stress.

The president of the Dominican Republic is styled &quot;Your Excellency, Mr. President&quot; during his time in office. His official residence is the National Palace.

The article CXXVIII of the constitution instructs the president of the &quot;faithful execution of the Dominican Law&quot; and confers on him the rank of commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, the National Police and all the state security forces. It has the power to appoint ministers, grant pardons, moratoria and the duty of ensuring national security and the collection and faithful investment of national income. The constitution also places it as the head of the state&#x27;s foreign policy and grants it the power to appoint diplomatic representatives on the recommendation and approval of the Senate of the Dominican Republic. The constitution of the Dominican Republic was published in 1801

The president is elected by universal suffrage for a term of four years. Since the Constitution of the Dominican Republic of 1966, in its modification of 2015, no person can be elected to the position of president more than twice. In case of death, dismissal, or resignation of a president, the vice president of the Dominican Republic assumes the presidency. In the absence of both, the executive branch may organize an interim government or pass control of the government to the legislative branch.

There have been 54 people who have taken office. The first president was Pedro Santana, who was invested on 14 November 1844 by decision of the Central Government Junta. The current president of the Dominican Republic is Luis Abinader of the Modern Revolutionary Party, who won the 2020 Dominican Republic general election and took office on 16 August 2020 from Danilo Medina. He was re-elected for a second term in the 2024 Dominican Republic general election.
Beginning in the first decade of the 21st century, the Dominican presidency has taken on a more participatory role at the global level, strengthening diplomatic ties throughout the world and serving as a mediator in conflicts as close as the 2009 Honduran coup d&#x27;état and so far away as the Arab–Israeli conflict.

==Origins==

The origin of the presidency of the Dominican Republic goes back to the War of Independence, when the Central Government Junta (JCG) constituted the first form of government that the country had in independent and republican living conditions.

The main activities, at such a convulsive moment, were to lead the war against the invasion of the Haitians, since it depended on the survival of the newly born state and the application of emergency measures of a provisional nature in order to put the governmental machinery, the collection of taxes, inform foreign powers of the existence of the new state and extend its dominion over the newly liberated territory. At the beginning J.C.G. He had to keep Haitian laws in force for a while, since otherwise the courts, the collection of taxes, municipalities, customs and other indispensable organisms for the normal course of the institutional life of every society would not have worked. The J.C.G. He ruled the country for an eight-month period.

In July 1844, General Pedro Santana, after a streak of successive victories in the southern part of the country, appeared with his army in Santo Domingo and was proclaimed President of the Junta Central Government. The following month, Santana sent the nation&#x27;s Founding Fathers into exile. On 14 November of that same year he took office as the first constitutional president of the Dominican Republic.

==Constitutional role==

The Constitution of the Dominican Republic, which was most recently amended in 2015, establishes the requirements, rights and obligations of the president of the republic.

The office can be held for up to two consecutive four-year terms. People who have completed their presidencies cannot run for president again. The change of command takes place every four years, on 16 August, which is the day of the Restoration of the Republic, a national holiday.

Prior to 2015, the president was limited to one consecutive term, but could run for the office again after at least one subsequent term.

==Constitutions through Trujillo==

The first Dominican constitution was promulgated on 6 November 1844, immediately after the nation achieved independence from Haiti. It was a liberal document with many familiar elements—separation of powers, checks and balances, and a long list of basic rights. However, an authoritarian government replaced the country&#x27;s liberal, democratic government during its first year. The new regime proceeded to write its own constitution. This second constitution considerably strengthened the executive, weakened the legislative and the judicial branches, and gave the president widespread emergency powers, including the power to suspend basic rights and to rule by decree. Thereafter, governance of the country often alternated between liberal and authoritarian constitutional systems.

Even the dictator Rafael Trujillo always took care to operate under the banner of constitutionalism. Under Trujillo, however, the legislature was simply a rubber stamp; the courts were not independent; and basic rights all but ceased to exist. He governed as a tyrant, unfettered by constitutional restrictions.

==Constitutions after Trujillo==

After Trujillo&#x27;s death in 1961, the constitution was amended to provide for new elections and to allow the transfer of power to an interim Council of State. Although promulgated as a new document, the 1962 constitution was actually a continuation of the Trujillo constitution, and it was thus unpopular.

In 1964, Juan Bosch&#x27;s freely elected, social-democratic government drafted a new and far more liberal constitution. It separated church and state, put severe limits on the political activities of the armed forces, established a wide range of civil liberties, and restricted the rights of property relative to individual rights. These provisions frightened the more conservative elements in Dominican society, which banded together to oust Bosch and his constitution in September 1963. Subsequently, the more conservative 1962 constitution was restored. In the name of constitutionalism, Bosch and his followers launched a revolution in 1965, the objective of which was restoration of the liberal 1963 constitution.

Largely as a result of the United States military intervention of April 1965, the civil war had died down by 1966. With Joaquín Balaguer and his party in control, the Dominicans wrote still another constitution. This one was intended to avert the conflicts and polarization of the past by combining features from both the liberal and the conservative traditions. The 1966 Constitution incorporated a long list of basic rights, and it provided for a strengthened legislature; however, it also gave extensive powers to the executive, including emergency powers. In this way, the country sought to bridge the gap between its democratic and its authoritarian constitutions, by compromising their differences.

Later constitutions were enacted in 1994 and 2002.

<doc id="451898" wikidata="Q369797" url="?curid=451898" title="The Hot Spot">
<text>The Hot Spot is a 1990 American neo-noir romantic thriller film directed by Dennis Hopper, based on the 1953 novel &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot; by Charles Williams, who also co-wrote the screenplay. It stars Don Johnson, Virginia Madsen, and Jennifer Connelly, and features a score by Jack Nitzsche played by John Lee Hooker, Miles Davis, Taj Mahal, Roy Rogers, Tim Drummond, and drummer Earl Palmer.

==Plot==
Drifter Harry Madox takes a job as a used car salesman in a small Texas town. In the summer heat, he develops an interest in Gloria Harper, a young demure woman who works at the car dealership in the loan office. He notices Gloria&#x27;s legs, and her shoes which have wooden fruit on them. Dolly Harshaw, who is married to the dealership&#x27;s owner, flirts shamelessly with Harry, telling him that she has a pair of shoes exactly like Gloria&#x27;s. Soon after they begin a torrid affair.

Harry learns that the staff of the local bank are all volunteer firemen and that the cameras in the bank do not work. After careful planning, he sets a fire in a building across the street to lure them all away and while they are gone, he robs the bank. His conscience forces him to enter the burning building to save a homeless man trapped inside. Despite this the town&#x27;s sheriff suspects Harry of committing the robbery and he is arrested. He learns the money is useless anyway as the serial numbers were recorded. Dolly gives him an alibi and tells him she will sell him out unless he kills her husband, whom she married for his money. When he refuses, Dolly threatens to expose him. She ultimately kills her husband herself by overstimulating his weak heart during a vigorous sexual encounter.

Meanwhile, Harry discovers that Gloria is being blackmailed by a local criminal named Frank Sutton. Sutton has nude photographs he took of Gloria and her best friend Irene Davey, after following them down by the local swimming hole, having heard tell of Irene being with another woman, who was her former teacher. Irene killed herself after being blackmailed and Harry, who has fallen in love with the 19-year-old Gloria, confronts Sutton to get the pictures. The tense conversation escalates into a fight, and Harry severely beats Sutton, but he defiantly continues to blackmail Gloria. Harry visits Sutton at his home and finds him having sex with a woman having wooden fruit shoes exactly like those belonging to Gloria. As Harry and Sutton begin fighting the unknown woman escapes, suffering an injury to her face. Harry ends up killing Sutton in the ensuing struggle. He plants the stolen money to divert suspicion away from himself, and disposes of the shoes, believing they belong to Gloria. He then tells the police that Sutton, who had no job and few assets, had recently paid cash for a new car, making it seem that Sutton had robbed the bank. The serial numbers tally and Harry receives the promise of a hefty reward for providing the tip that helps the police &quot;solve&quot; the robbery. He plans to marry Gloria and take her to the Caribbean Islands.

After being called over by the new business owner, Dolly, to the Harshaw house, Harry notices as they arrive that Gloria is wearing her wooden fruit shoes. Then Harry seeing the fresh scar on Dolly&#x27;s face realizes that it was her and not Gloria who was having sex with Sutton. Before he can maneuver, Dolly ruins Harry&#x27;s plans by showing him a copy of a certified letter she says she has entrusted to her attorney, to be opened in the event of her death. The letter is a firsthand account that will implicate him in the bank robbery, in Sutton&#x27;s death, and records Gloria&#x27;s embezzlement, information she had from Sutton. Dolly tells Gloria that Harry told her she was using company funds to pay off Sutton. Dolly then tells Gloria that she won&#x27;t go to the police and that she can keep her job at the car dealership to pay back the money she stole. Believing she has been played for a fool, a heartbroken Gloria leaves Harry. Trapped, enraged, Harry tries to strangle Dolly, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Harry resigns himself to life with Dolly, and leaves town with her.

==Cast==
==Production==
Charles Williams wrote a screenplay version of his own novel with Nona Tyson in 1962. It was intended for Robert Mitchum. Many years later, Dennis Hopper found the script and updated it. The director described the film as &quot;&quot;Last Tango in Texas&quot;. Real hot, steamy stuff&quot;.

A bedroom scene originally called for Madsen to appear naked, but she decided to put on a negligee because she felt that, &quot;Not only was the nudity weak storywise, but it didn&#x27;t let the audience undress her&quot;. Hopper later admitted that Madsen was right.

Dennis Hopper gave his impressions of working with Johnson:

He wasn&#x27;t that bad. He has a lot of people with him. He came on to this film with two bodyguards, a cook, a trainer, ah let&#x27;s see, a helicopter pilot he comes to and from the set in a helicopter, very glamorous let&#x27;s see, two drivers, a secretary, and, oh yes, his own hair person, his own make-up person, his own wardrobe person. So when he walks to the set he has five people with him.

Johnson found Hopper&#x27;s approach to filmmaking &quot;a little disappointing, I gotta tell you&quot;. He later recalled:

Mike Figgis had written a script called &quot;The Hot Spot&quot;, and it was a heist movie. Three days before we started shooting, Dennis Hopper came to all of us, he called a meeting on a Sunday, and he said, &quot;Okay, we&#x27;re not making that script. We&#x27;re making this one.&quot; And he passed a script around the table that had been written for Robert Mitchum in the &#x27;60s... or maybe it was the &#x27;50s... and it was based on a book called &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot;. And that was the movie that we ended up making. This was three days before we started shooting! So he was kind of looking around the table at everybody and saying, &quot;Well, you know, if Don Johnson bails, we don&#x27;t have a movie.&quot; [Laughs.] And I read the script, and I said, &quot;Wow!&quot; I mean, the Figgis script was really slick and cool, and it was a heist movie, but this was real noir, the guy was an amoral drifter, and it was all about how women were going to take him down.

Hopper shot the film on location in Texas during what he described as the &quot;hottest, steamiest weather you could imagine&quot;. The primary locations were in Taylor, Texas, especially its iconic downtown area, locations around and in Austin as well as in Luling. The swimming scenes were filmed at the Hamilton Pool Preserve west of Austin. In part of the skinny-dipping scene, Madsen was body doubled by Heather Cruikshank, who was working in a strip club when she was cast.

==Reception==
&quot;The Hot Spot&quot; had its world premiere at the 1990 Toronto International Film Festival. Director Dennis Hopper felt that stars Don Johnson and Virginia Madsen were not as enthusiastic in promoting the film as he would have liked. Hopper said of Johnson that &quot;He says he&#x27;s not going to do anything for this picture until he reads the reviews.&quot; Johnson claims that he was unable to do promotion because he was shooting the film &quot;Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man&quot;. Of Madsen, Hopper claimed that she &quot;was very embarrassed&quot; by the amount of her on-screen nudity. The film was released on October 12, 1990, in 23 theaters, grossing US$112,188 in its opening weekend. The film grossed only $1.2 million in the North American market, far less than the cost of its production.

&quot;The Hot Spot&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 71% rating at based on reviews from 28 critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Only movie lovers who have marinated their imaginations in the great B movies from RKO and Republic will recognize &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; as a superior work in an old tradition.&quot; In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;Mr. Hopper&#x27;s direction is tough and stylish, in effective contrast with the sunny look of Ueli Steiger&#x27;s cinematography.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, &quot;In other words, Hopper&#x27;s direction isn&#x27;t any great shakes, and the wrap-up is somewhat confusing, but this film does make you want to go skinny-dipping with someone else&#x27;s mate.&quot; In his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe wrote, &quot;&quot;Hot Spot&quot; will never go down as timeless, neoclassic noir. But, with its Hopperlike moments, over-the-top performances and infectious music, it carries you along for a spell.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;Hopper still hasn&#x27;t learned how to pace a movie, but working from Charles Williams&#x27; 1952 novel &quot;Hell Hath No Fury&quot; he comes up with a reasonably diverting hothouse yarn.&quot;

==Home media==
In 1990, the movie premiered exclusively on Showtime.

On August 13, 2013, Shout! Factory released &quot;The Hot Spot&quot; on Blu-ray as part of a double feature along with &quot;Killing Me Softly&quot;. Kino Lorber re-released the film on Blu-ray on May 4, 2021 in a new 2k master, containing new interviews with Virginia Madsen and William Sadler, and an audio commentary from entertainment journalist Bryan Reesman.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack for the film is composed by Jack Nitzsche and features an original collaboration between John Lee Hooker, Miles Davis, Taj Mahal, Tim Drummond, Earl Palmer, and Roy Rogers. Allmusic describes the soundtrack album as &quot;marvelous music ... something listeners should be thankful for, particularly fans of either Miles Davis or John Lee Hooker&quot;.

<doc id="451900" wikidata="Q655829" url="?curid=451900" title="Governor-General of Grenada">
<text>The governor-general of Grenada is the representative of the Grenadian monarch, currently King Charles III, in Grenada. The governor-general is appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister of Grenada. The functions of the governor-general include appointing ministers, judges, and ambassadors; giving Royal Assent to legislation passed by the Grenadian Parliament; and issuing writs for election. 

In general, the governor-general observes the conventions of the Westminster system and responsible government, maintaining a political neutrality, and has to always act only on the advice of the prime minister. The governor-general also has a ceremonial role: hosting events at the official vice-regal residence in the capital, St. George&#x27;s and bestowing honours to individuals and groups who are contributing to Grenada and to their communities. When travelling abroad, the governor-general is seen as the representative of Grenada and its monarch.

Governors-general formally serve &quot;at the monarch&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. Since 7 May 2013, the governor-general has been Dame Cécile La Grenade.

The office of the governor-general was created on 7 February 1974, when Grenada gained independence from the United Kingdom as a sovereign state and an independent constitutional monarchy. Since then, 6 individuals have served as governor-general.

==Appointment==

The governor-general is formally appointed by the monarch of Grenada. When a new governor-general is to be appointed, the prime minister recommends a name to the monarch, who by convention accepts that recommendation. At the installation ceremony, the new governor-general takes an Oath of Allegiance and Office.

==Functions==

Grenada shares the person of the sovereign equally with 14 other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. As the sovereign works and resides predominantly outside of Grenadian borders, the governor-general&#x27;s primary task is to perform the monarch&#x27;s constitutional duties on his or her behalf. As such, the governor-general carries out his or her functions in the government of Grenada on behalf and in the name of the Sovereign, but is not involved in the day-to day running of the government.

The governor-general&#x27;s powers and roles are derived from the Grenadian constitution&#x27;s Section 19 to 22, which set out certain provisions relating to the governor-general.

===Constitutional role===

The governor-general is responsible for summoning, proroguing, and dissolving parliament and issues writs for new elections. After an election, the governor-general formally requests the leader of the political party which gains the support of a majority in parliament to form a government. The governor-general commissions the prime minister and appoints other ministers after the election.

The governor-general, on the Sovereign&#x27;s behalf, gives royal assent to laws passed by the Parliament of Grenada.

The governor-general also appoints state judges, ministers, ambassadors and high commissioners to overseas countries, and other senior government officials.

The governor-general may, in certain circumstances, exercise without – or contrary to – ministerial advice. These are known as the reserve powers, and include:
*appointing a prime minister if an election has resulted in a &#x27;hung parliament&#x27;.
*dismissing the prime minister who has lost the confidence of the parliament.
*dismissing any minister acting unlawfully.
*refusing to dissolve the House of Representatives despite a request from the prime minister.

===Ceremonial role===

The governor-general&#x27;s ceremonial duties include opening new sessions of parliament by delivering the Speech from the Throne, welcoming visiting heads of state, and receiving the credentials of foreign diplomats.

The governor-general serves as Chancellor of Grenada&#x27;s two national orders: the Order of Grenada (within this the Order of the Nation), and Order of the National Hero. As such, the governor-general is responsible for appointing members to these orders. Such honours and awards, in addition to honours bestowed directly by the monarch, are presented by the governor-general at investitures at Governor-General&#x27;s House, St George&#x27;s. In 2023, Governor-General Dame Cecile La Grenade carried out the first investiture ceremony outside of the vice-regal residence in history, when she travelled to the island of Petite Martinique for a special investiture ceremony.

===Community role===

The governor-general provides non-partisan leadership in the community, acting as patron of many charitable, service, sporting and cultural organisations, and attending functions throughout the country. The governor-general serves as patron of several organizations including Grenada Red Cross Society, the Grenada National Council of the Disabled, the Grenada Yacht Club, the Grenada Amateur Radio Club, and the Grenada Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The governor-general is also president of the Grenada Council of the Order of Saint John.

The governor-general also encourages, articulates and represents those things that unite Grenadians together. In this role, the governor-general:

*attends charitable, social, and civic events across the country.
*accepts patronage of many national, charitable, cultural, educational, sporting and professional organisations.
*visits and gives speeches at non-governmental organisations.

==Privileges==

===Salary===

The governor-general receives an annual salary of EC$ 148,539.

===Symbols===

The governor-general uses a personal flag, which features a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with &quot;Grenada&quot; written on a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. It is flown on buildings and other locations in Grenada to mark the governor-general&#x27;s presence.

===Residence===

Government House in St. George&#x27;s was the official residence of the governor-general of Grenada. Since Government House was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan in 2004, the governor-general has resided in a residence in Point Salines, south of the capital.

<doc id="451902" wikidata="Q1151934" url="?curid=451902" title="Iron triangle (US politics)">
<text>In United States politics, the &quot;iron triangle&quot; comprises the policy-making relationship among the congressional committees, the bureaucracy, and interest groups, as described in 1981 by Gordon Adams. Earlier mentions of this &#x27;iron triangle&#x27; concept are in a 1956 &quot;Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report&quot; as, &quot;Iron triangle: Clout, background, and outlook&quot; and &quot;Chinks in the Iron Triangle?&quot;

== Central assumption ==
Central to the concept of an iron triangle is the assumption that bureaucratic agencies, as political entities, seek to create and consolidate their own power base.

In this view, the power of an agency (such as State-owned enterprises of the United States, Independent agencies of the United States government or Regulatory agency) is determined by its constituency, not by its consumers. (For these purposes, &quot;constituents&quot; are politically active members sharing a common interest or goal; &quot;consumers&quot; are the expected recipients of goods or services provided by a governmental bureaucracy and often are identified in an agency&#x27;s written goals or mission statement.)

Apparent bureaucratic dysfunction may be attributable to the alliances formed between the agency and its constituency. The official goals of an agency may appear to be thwarted or ignored altogether, at the expense of the citizenry it is designed to serve.

== Cultivation of constituency ==
The necessity for a bureaucratic institution to establish a strong support base often results in the institution fostering ties with a specific group within its policy jurisdiction. This is accomplished by identifying potential allies that could significantly enhance its power in the political sphere, utilizing their civic intelligence to leverage collective social capital.

Notably, within the more junior tiers of the bureaucracy, the intended recipients of an agency&#x27;s services may not possess significant influence, resulting in their perception as ineffective supporters. Large portions of the general public, whose interests are widespread, may lack political engagement, demonstrate inconsistent voting behaviors, suffer from disorganization or inertia, and frequently lack financial strength or resources.

In contrast, private entities or advocacy groups, including 501(c) and 527 organizations, often wield substantial power. These groups typically have robust organization, considerable resources, high mobilization capacity, and are highly active in political endeavors, evidenced by their voting patterns, campaign contributions, lobbying activities, and even initiating legislation.

Therefore, an agency might find it advantageous to shift its attention away from its designated service recipients towards a strategically chosen group of supporters. This enables the agency to pursue its objective of increasing its political clout.

== Dynamics ==

In the United States, power is exercised in the Congress, and, particularly, in congressional committees and subcommittees. By aligning itself with selected constituencies, an agency may be able to affect policy outcomes directly in these committees and subcommittees. This is where an iron triangle may manifest itself.

The image above displays the concept.

* At one corner of the triangle are interest groups (constituencies) and non-state actors. These are the powerful interest groups that influence Congressional votes in their favor and can sufficiently influence the re-election of a member of Congress in return for support of their programs.
* At another corner sit members of Congress who also seek to align themselves with a constituency for political and electoral support. These congressional members support legislation that advances an interest group&#x27;s agenda.
* Occupying the third corner of the triangle are bureaucrats, who often are pressured by the same powerful interest groups their agency is designated to regulate, and in some cases have close ties to the regulated industry.

The result is a three-way, stable alliance that sometimes is called a &quot;sub-government&quot; because of its durability, impregnability, and power to determine policy.
An iron triangle relationship can result in regulatory capture, the passing of very narrow, pork-barrel policies that benefit a small segment of the population. The interests of the agency&#x27;s constituency (the interest groups) are met, while the needs of consumers (which may be the general public) are passed over.

That public administration may result in benefiting a small segment of the public in this way, may be viewed as problematic for the popular concept of democracy if the general welfare of all citizens is sacrificed for very specific interests. This is especially so if the passed legislation neglects or reverses the original purpose for which the agency was established. The Regulatory Capture Prevention Act of 2011 - Establishes the Office of Regulatory Integrity in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), requires investigation when it involves:

# Agency action or inaction that fails to advance the mission of the agency or is otherwise inimical to the public interest
# Regulation, licensing, adjudication, grants, or other agency action that favors a limited number of economic interests or is otherwise inimical to the public interest
# Enforcement priorities that are not reasonably calculated to accomplish regulatory goals; and
# A loss of confidence in the integrity of the regulatory process.

Some maintain to the contrary, that such arrangements are natural outgrowths of, and not discordant with, the democratic process, since they frequently involve a majority block of voters implementing their will—through their elected representatives in government.

On January 27, 2011, FBI Director Robert Mueller used &quot;iron triangles&quot; to refer to &quot;organized criminals, corrupt government officials, and business leaders&quot; which he said &quot;pose a significant national security threat&quot;.

<text>The Montreux Jazz Festival (formerly Festival de Jazz Montreux and Festival International de Jazz Montreux) is a music festival in Switzerland, held annually in early July in Montreux on the Lake Geneva shoreline. It is the second-largest annual jazz festival in the world after Canada&#x27;s Montreal International Jazz Festival.

Initiator and head organizer Claude Nobs brought an array of artists to Montreux. Mathieu Jaton has organised the festival since Nobs&#x27; death in 2013.

==History==
The Montreux Jazz Festival opened was founded in 1967 by Claude Nobs, Géo Voumard and René Langel with considerable help from Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun of Atlantic Records. The festival was first held at Montreux Casino. The driving force is the tourism office under the direction of Raymond Jaussi. It lasted for three days and featured almost exclusively jazz artists. The highlights of this era were Charles Lloyd, Miles Davis, Keith Jarrett, Jack DeJohnette, Bill Evans, Soft Machine, Weather Report, The Fourth Way, Nina Simone, Jan Garbarek, and Ella Fitzgerald.
Originally a pure jazz festival, it opened up in the 1970s and today presents artists working in various styles of music. Jazz remains an important part of the festival. Part of the festival&#x27;s expansion was due to coproduction by Quincy Jones, who brought many international artists in the early 1990s. Today&#x27;s festival lasts about two weeks and attracts an audience of more than 200,000 people.

In the 1970s, the festival began broadening its scope, including blues, soul, and rock artists; for instance, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Frank Zappa, Deep Purple, Canned Heat and many others. Towards the end of the decade, the festival expanded even more, including music from all continents (with an emphasis on Brazilian music) and lasting a full three weeks. Santana came to Montreux for the first time in 1970; Van Morrison played in 1974 and 1980. The Dubliners played there on the festival in 1976. Other artists included B.B. King, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Gary Moore, Weather Report, Don Ellis, Crossfire, Buddy Guy, Camarón de la Isla and Tomatito, Soft Machine, Chuck Berry, Peter Tosh, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Eric Clapton, Luther Allison, Bo Diddley, Stan Getz, Airto Moreira, Joe Henderson, Dizzy Gillespie, Oscar Peterson, Ney Matogrosso, Charles Mingus, Etta James, Sonny Rollins, Son House, Count Basie, Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Gilberto Gil, Ray Charles, James Booker, Hermeto Pascoal, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Rory Gallagher, Marianne Faithfull, Elis Regina, Les McCann, Eddie Harris, Pasadena Roof Orchestra, New Order, Jaco Pastorius, Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band, Toto, Zucchero Fornaciari, André Geraissati, Korni Grupa, Jan Akkerman, Joe Satriani, Status Quo, Prince, and many more.

Since 1967, the festival has allowed a Swiss or international artist to design the official poster every year. Swiss artist Pierre Keller was an art consultant to the festival. Keller recruited artists such as Jean Tinguely, Keith Haring, Niki de Saint Phalle, Shigeo Fukuda, and Andy Warhol to create artwork for the festival in the 1980s.

==Venue==
The festival was originally held at the original Montreux Casino, which burned down in December 1971 during Frank Zappa&#x27;s performance (as referenced in &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; by Deep Purple). The festival was held then in other auditoriums in Montreux, until it could return to the rebuilt new Casino in 1975. The festival continued to grow, and in 1993, it moved to the larger Montreux Convention Centre. From 1995 through 2008, it occupied both the convention centre and the casino. Beginning with the 41st MJF in 2007, nightly performances of headliners were again moved mainly to the Montreux Musique &amp; Convention Centre (though the Casino still hosts the odd one-off shows), owing mainly to logistics: the Casino is approximately from the Convention Centre, making it difficult for crew, artists and technical personnel (as well as fans) to travel easily through crowded streets from one venue to the other. (This is exacerbated by the presence of a large number of streetside vendors and artisans – as well as strolling crowds of tourists – on the lakefront walk that connects the venues.) As of 2007, the Convention Centre hosts two main stages, Auditorium Stravinski (capacity 3,500) and Miles Davis Hall (capacity 1,800), as well as the smaller Montreux Jazz Cafe, and several smaller open-air stages around the Centre. Additional themed shows (Bahia, Blues, etc.) are held on boats cruising the lake and train cars traveling the region, and various workshops and competitions are held at the nearby Montreux Palais and Le Petit Palais.

The Convention Centre closed for renovation in July 2023, and is expected to reopen in 2025. During its closure, major concerts at the Festival will be held on a specially built stage on the lake.

===Venue history===
== Expansion ==

The festival changed in the 1980s: it grew dramatically and included an even wider variety of music styles. Jazz remained important, as did Brazilian music, but more rock and pop artists were also invited.

Miles Davis came to Montreux several times, British hard rock band Deep Purple were invited as headliners eight times, and Status Quo have headlined the festival twice. Other notable artists at Montreux were Sandra, Max Roach, James Brown, George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Wynton Marsalis, Art Blakey, John McLaughlin, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Wayne Shorter, Al Di Meola, Elvis Costello, Jimmy Cliff, Steel Pulse, Mike Oldfield, Brian May, Marvin Gaye, Rory Gallagher, Leonard Cohen, Nina Hagen, Eric Clapton, Queen, Phil Collins, Philip Bailey, Joe Cocker, Los Lobos, The Manhattan Transfer, Tracy Chapman, and Van Morrison again.

The expansion that began in the 1980s has continued since then – Montreux transformed from a jazz festival into a world music festival. Quincy Jones co-produced the festival from 1991 to 1993. By 1993, the festival had outgrown the Casino and moved to the larger Convention Centre. The number of visitors rose from 75,000 in 1980 to 120,000 in 1994, and an &quot;Off-festival&quot; developed on the lakeshore promenades and in the cafés of Montreux.

Many &quot;regulars&quot; returned, but many new artists also appeared on stage: Sting, Bob Dylan, Fats Domino, Deep Purple, Al Jarreau, Chaka Khan, Johnny Cash, Cheap Trick, Cheb Mami, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, Marianne Faithfull, Ice-T, Jazzmatazz, ZZ Top, Simply Red, Marisa Monte, George Benson, Jazzkantine, Alanis Morissette, David Bowie, Paul Simon. In 1999, the festival saw more than 220,000 visitors.

The festival has also played host to some well-known and talented student groups, including big bands and vocal ensembles. Young, talented musicians are encouraged to take part in several competitions.

==Competitions==
Three international competitions are organised by the Montreux Jazz Artists Foundation every year: Solo Piano, Guitar, and Voice. Each competition has its own jury composed of professionals and chaired by a world-renowned musician (in 2008: Fazıl Say for the Piano Solo, Lee Ritenour for the Guitar, Patti Austin for the Voice competition). In addition, until 2016, a local competition, the Tremplin Lémanique, was aimed at jazz bands that are based in one of the regions of the Léman lake: the French departments of Ain and Haute Savoie and the Swiss cantons of Geneva, Vaud and Valais.

==Performances==
Over 1300 artists have performed at the Festival from 1967 to 2016, with the most appearances by Herbie Hancock (27 times) and B.B. King (21 times).

<text>Detective Comics (later retitled as Batman Detective Comics) is an American comic book series published by Detective Comics, later shortened to DC Comics. The first volume, published from 1937 to 2011 (and later continued in 2016), is best known for introducing the superhero Batman in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (cover-dated May 1939).

A second series of the same title was launched in September 2011, but in 2016, reverted to the original volume numbering. The series is the source of its publishing company&#x27;s name, and—along with &quot;Action Comics&quot;, the series that launched with the debut of Superman—one of the medium&#x27;s signature series. Between 1937 and 2011, there were 881 issues of the series. It is the longest-running comic book series in the United States.

==Publication history==

&quot;Detective Comics&quot; was the final publication of the entrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, whose comics company, National Allied Publications, would evolve into DC Comics, one of the world&#x27;s two largest comic book publishers, though long after its founder had left it. Wheeler-Nicholson&#x27;s first two titles were the landmark &quot;New Fun: The Big Comic-Magazine&quot; #1 (cover-dated Feb. 1935), colloquially called &quot;New Fun Comics&quot; #1 and the first such early comic book to contain all-original content, rather than a mix of newspaper comic strips and comic-strip-style new material. His second effort, &quot;New Comics&quot; #1, would be retitled twice to become &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, another seminal series that ran for decades until issue #503 in 1983, and was later revived in 2009.

The third and final title published under his aegis would be &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936, but eventually premiering three months later, with a March 1937 cover date. Wheeler-Nicholson was in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld, who was, as well, a pulp-magazine publisher and a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News. Wheeler-Nicholson took Donenfeld on as a partner to publish &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #1 with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack Liebowitz, Donenfeld&#x27;s accountant, listed as owners. Wheeler-Nicholson was forced out a year later.

Originally an anthology comic, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #1 (March 1937) featured stories in the &quot;hard-boiled detective&quot; genre, with such stars as Ching Lung (a Fu Manchu-style &quot;Yellow Peril&quot; villain); Slam Bradley (created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster before their character &quot;Superman&quot; saw print two years later); and Speed Saunders, among others. Its first editor, Vin Sullivan, also drew the debut issue&#x27;s cover. The Crimson Avenger debuted in issue #20 (October 1938).

Early issues of the series have been criticized for their racism and xenophobia.

===Batman / Bruce Wayne===
&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (released March 1939, with a cover date of May 1939) marked the first appearance of Batman. He would eventually become the star of the title, the cover logo of which is often written as &quot;Detective Comics featuring Batman&quot;. Because of its significance, issue #27 is among the most valuable comic books in existence, with one copy selling for $1,075,000 in a February 2010 auction.

Batman&#x27;s origin is first revealed in a two-page story in issue #33 (Nov. 1939). Batman became the main cover feature of the title beginning with issue #35 (Jan. 1940). Issue #38 (April 1940) introduced Batman&#x27;s sidekick Robin, billed as &quot;The Sensational Character Find of 1940&quot; on the cover and the first of several characters that would make up the &quot;Batman Family.&quot; Robin&#x27;s appearance and the subsequent increase in sales of the book soon led to the trend of superheroes and young sidekicks that characterize the era that fans and historians call the &quot;Golden Age of Comic Books.&quot; Several of Batman&#x27;s best known villains debuted in the pages of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; during this era, including the Penguin in issue #58, Two-Face in issue #66, and the Riddler in issue #140.

Batwoman first appeared in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #233 (July 1956). Since the family formula had proven very successful for the Superman franchise, editor Jack Schiff suggested to Batman co-creator Bob Kane that he create one for the Batman. A female was chosen first, to offset the charges made by Fredric Wertham that Batman and Robin were homosexual. Writer Bill Finger and artist Sheldon Moldoff introduced Bat-Mite in issue #267 (May 1959) and Clayface in #298 (Dec. 1961).

In 1964, Julius Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the fading Batman titles. Writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the franchise, such as Ace the Bathound and Bat-Mite and gave the character a &quot;New Look&quot; that premiered in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #327 (May 1964). Schwartz, Gardner Fox, and Infantino introduced, from the William Dozier produced TV series, Barbara Gordon as a new version of Batgirl in a story titled &quot;The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!&quot; in issue #359 (Jan. 1967). Mike Friedrich wrote the 30th anniversary Batman story in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #387 (May 1969) which was drawn by Bob Brown.

Writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams had their first collaboration on Batman on the story &quot;The Secret of the Waiting Graves&quot; in issue #395 (Jan. 1970). The duo, under the direction of Schwartz, would revitalize the character with a series of noteworthy stories reestablishing Batman&#x27;s dark, brooding nature and taking the books away from the campy look and feel of the 1966–68 ABC TV series. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that &quot;O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s interpretation of Batman as a vengeful obsessive-compulsive, which he modestly describes as a return to the roots, was actually an act of creative imagination that has influenced every subsequent version of the Dark Knight.&quot; Adams introduced the Man-Bat with writer Frank Robbins in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #400 (June 1970). O&#x27;Neil and artist Bob Brown crafted Batman&#x27;s first encounter with the League of Assassins in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #405 (Nov. 1970) and created Talia al Ghul in issue #411 (May 1971).

After publishing on a monthly schedule throughout its run, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; became a bi-monthly book from issues #435 (June–July 1973) to #445 (Feb.-March 1975). Issues #438 (Dec. 1973-Jan. 1974) to #445 (Feb.–March 1975) of the series were in the 100 Page Super Spectacular format. O&#x27;Neil and artist Dick Giordano created the Batman supporting character Leslie Thompkins in the story &quot;There Is No Hope in Crime Alley&quot; appearing in issue #457 (March 1976). Writer Steve Englehart and artist Marshall Rogers produced an acclaimed run of Batman stories in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #471–476 (Aug. 1977 – April 1978), and provided one of the definitive interpretations that influenced the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; film and would be adapted for the 1990s . The Englehart and Rogers pairing, was described in 2009 by comics writer and historian Robert Greenberger as &quot;one of the greatest&quot; creative teams to work on the Batman character. In their story &quot;The Laughing Fish&quot;, the Joker is brazen enough to disfigure fish with a rictus grin, then expects to be granted a federal trademark on them, only to start killing the bureaucrats who try to explain to him that obtaining such a claim on a natural resource is legally impossible. 
Writer Len Wein and Rogers co-created the third version of the supervillain Clayface in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #478 (July–Aug. 1978). From issue #481 (Dec. 1978 – Jan. 1979) through #495 (Oct. 1980), the magazine adopted the expanded Dollar Comics format used by the canceled &quot;Batman Family&quot;, adding solo features including &quot;Robin: the Teen Wonder&quot;, &quot;Batgirl&quot;, the &quot;Human Target&quot; and the anthology &quot;Tales of Gotham City&quot;, which featured stories of the city&#x27;s ordinary people. Julius Schwartz, who had edited the title for most of its run since 1964, left the series as of issue #484 (June–July 1979) The original Katherine Kane also known as &quot;Batwoman&quot; was killed in the lead story in issue #485 (Aug.–Sept. 1979) by the League of Assassins.
The title&#x27;s 500th issue (March 1981) featured stories by several well-known creators including television writer Alan Brennert and Walter B. Gibson best known for his work on the pulp fiction character &quot;The Shadow&quot;. Also used during the 1980s was the use of serialization of the main Batman story, with stories from &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; directly flowing from one book to another, with cliffhangers at the end of each book&#x27;s monthly story that would be resolved in the other title of that month. A single writer handled both books during that time beginning with Gerry Conway and followed up by Doug Moench. The supervillain Killer Croc made a shadowy cameo in issue #523 (Feb. 1983). Noted author Harlan Ellison wrote the Batman story in issue #567.

Writer Mike W. Barr and artists Alan Davis and Todd McFarlane crafted the &quot;&quot; storyline in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #575–578 which followed up on Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Writer Alan Grant and artist Norm Breyfogle introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story together and the Ratcatcher in their third (#585). Sam Hamm, who wrote the screenplay for Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;, wrote the &quot;Blind Justice&quot; story in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; issues #598–600. Chuck Dixon became the writer of the series with issue #644 (May 1992). He and Tom Lyle co-created the Electrocutioner in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #644 (May 1992) and Stephanie Brown in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #647 (August 1992).

The &quot;&quot; storyline began in issue #700 (August 1996). The &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline crossed over into &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in issues #730–741. Writer Greg Rucka and artist Shawn Martinbrough became the creative team as of issue #742 (March 2000) and created the Sasha Bordeaux character in issue #751 (Dec. 2000). Issue #800 (Jan. 2005) was written by Andersen Gabrych and drawn by Pete Woods. Paul Dini became the writer of the series as of issue #821 (Sept. 2006) and created a new version of the Ventriloquist in #827 (March 2007). Scott Snyder became the writer of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; with issue #871 (Jan. 2011).

===Back-up features===
In addition to the Batman stories, the title has had numerous back-up strips. The Boy Commandos by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #64 (June 1942) and were then soon spun off into their own title. The character Roy Raymond first appeared in issue #153 (Nov. 1949). The Martian Manhunter was created by writer Joseph Samachson and artist Joe Certa in the back-up story &quot;The Strange Experiment of Dr. Erdel&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #225 (Nov. 1955). After issue #326 (April 1964), the Martian Manhunter was moved to &quot;House of Mystery&quot; and in issue #327 the Elongated Man and his wife, now remodeled after Dashiell Hammett&#x27;s Nick and Nora Charles, took over. The characters crossed over with Batman three times. The Elongated Man run lasted until issue #383 (Jan. 1969) and his feature returned sporadically 15 times until issue #572, which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the title by teaming him up with Batman, Robin, Slam Bradley and Sherlock Holmes against Edgar Moriarty, the great-grandnephew of Professor Moriarty. After the Elongated Man back-up feature ended, Batgirl held the role until issue #424. She returned from issues 481–519 after being moved to Batman Family. Jason Bard appeared as the backup feature in the odd-numbered issues of &quot;Detective&quot; from #425–435. The Manhunter was resurrected in a story by Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson in issue #437 (Oct.-Nov. 1973). With the last episode of the series, Manhunter moved to the front of the book in a full-length team-up with Batman. The Green Arrow became the back-up feature starting with issue #521 (Dec. 1982) and running until #567 (Oct. 1986). The Black Canary received a new costume in the back-up story in issue #554 (Sept. 1985). &quot;DC Comics Bonus Book&quot;s were included in issues #589 (August 1988) and 595 (Jan. 1989).

After a lengthy absence, the backup features returned for issues #746–810. These were more closed-ended stories featuring new and established characters in the Batman mythos. The first was &quot;The Jacobian&quot; in issues #746–757, followed by a one-issue Batman story in #758. The following issues, #759–762, featured Slam Bradley and were a lead-in to the 2002 &quot;Catwoman&quot; series. Issues #763–772 featured Josephine &quot;Josie Mac&quot; MacDonald, a Gotham police detective. Issues #773–775 were titled &quot;Tales of Gotham&quot; and feature Detectives Crispus Allen and Renee Montoya. Batman starred in &quot;Spore&quot; from issues #776–780. #781 featured a special &quot;Elseworlds&quot; tale, while #782 featured a Batman solo tale. Issue #783 featured a prelude to the &quot;Death and the Maidens&quot; miniseries, and issue #784 featured a Josie Mac tale. The &quot;Tales of Gotham&quot; stories resumed in issues #785–788 with &quot;The Dogcatcher&quot;, and #789–794 featured &quot;The Tailor&quot;. &quot;Polished Stone&quot;, featuring the Green Arrow and Onyx, ran in issues #795–796. &quot;Low&quot;, featuring the Riddler and Poison Ivy, ran from issues #797–799. &quot;Under the title &quot;Tales of Gotham,&quot; Detective Comics #800 had a short Batman back-up story.&quot; A four-issue (#801–805) story featuring the Barker entitled &quot;When You&#x27;re Strange&quot; was next and &quot;Mud&quot; in issue #805. The last back-up was a three-issue (#808–810) story about Killer Croc. It came after a two-issue (#806–807) story about Alfred.

The &quot;Manhunter&quot; series that ran as a backup in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; from 1973 to 1974 won the Shazam Award for &quot;Best Individual Short Story (Dramatic)&quot; in 1974 for the story &quot;Cathedral Perilous&quot; in issue #441, written by Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson.

===Batwoman===

In 2009, as part of a planned reorganization of the Batman universe due to the events shown in &quot;Batman R.I.P.&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; went on hiatus for three months while DC Comics published the &quot;Battle for the Cowl&quot; miniseries. Upon its return, the series featured the newly reintroduced (in &quot;52&quot;) Batwoman as the new star of the book, as well as a 10-page back-up feature starring Renee Montoya as the new Question. The series returned Batman to a starring role in early 2010.

===The New 52===
DC Comics relaunched &quot;Detective Comics&quot; with issue #1 in September 2011, as part of an initiative called The New 52. The series was written and drawn by Tony Daniel until the 12th issue, with the team of John Layman and Jason Fabok beginning with issue #13.

The first issue of the relaunched &quot;Detective Comics&quot; has received six printings, second only to the relaunched &quot;Justice League&quot; which had seven printings. The series&#x27; 7th issue was also DC Comic&#x27;s 6th highest selling digital comic, ranking above many other series in the Batman category. Scott West of Sciencefiction.com gave the series&#x27; third arc a positive review, stating that &quot;After last month&#x27;s disappointing &#x27;Night of the Owls&#x27; tie-in issue, it&#x27;s nice to see &#x27;Detective Comics&#x27; getting back to where it should be...good detective stories.&quot; The relaunched &quot;Detective Comics&quot; received the award for &quot;Best Series&quot; at the 2012 Stan Lee Awards. The series&#x27; first collected edition would reach the number 1 spot on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list in the category of &quot;Hardcover Graphic Books&quot;.

Daniel wrote and penciled the series until the &quot;Night of the Owls&quot; crossover, at which point Ed Benes, Julio Ferreira, and Eduardo Pansica began drawing the series for a three-issue arc. The price of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; was increased due to the addition of a backup feature starring Batman villain Two-Face, which was written by Daniel and illustrated by Syzmon Kudranski, this followed a similar backup featuring Professor Hugo Strange. Daniel left the series with issue #12 being his last as writer and the &quot;0&quot; issue his last as penciller.

DC celebrated the first anniversary of The New 52 in September 2012 by publishing a number &quot;0&quot; of each original &quot;New 52&quot; title which act as prequels to the series and reveal previously unexplained plot elements. Gregg Hurwitz wrote the &quot;0&quot; issue. Hurwitz was approached by Daniel to write the &quot;0&quot; issue due to Daniel&#x27;s busy schedule. To follow up on the &quot;Night of the Owls&quot; elements in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, Daniel wrote &quot;Detective Comics Annual&quot; #1, which was pencilled by Romano Molenaar and inked by Sandu Florea.

Following Daniel&#x27;s tenure on the series, John Layman became the new writer and Jason Fabok the new artist with James Tynion IV writing the backup features and Syzmon Kudranski remaining as artist for Tynion&#x27;s first feature. With issue #19 of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; vol. 2, released on April 3, 2013, the series reached 900 issues as combined with the first volume of the series, and was a special oversized celebratory issue. Under Layman, the series featured its first crossover, &quot;Gothtopia&quot; after which Layman and Fabok moved to the &quot;Batman Eternal&quot; series and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; was taken over by Brain Buccalleto and Francis Manapul.

In commemoration of the second anniversary of The New 52, DC Comics announced &quot;Villains Month&quot; with &quot;Detective Comics&quot; getting four issues. The issues starred Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, the Scarecrow, and the Man-Bat, and, respectively, being numbered #23.1, #23.2, #23.3, and #23.4, by an ensemble of writers and artists.

For the 75th anniversary of Batman, issue #27 was a larger-sized issue featuring new stories by Brad Meltzer and Bryan Hitch, Scott Snyder and Sean Murphy, Peter Tomasi and Ian Bertram, John Layman and Jason Fabok, Gregg Hurwitz and Neal Adams, Mike W. Barr and Guillem March, and one written and drawn by Francesco Francavilla. In addition, variant covers to the issue were by Greg Capullo, Frank Miller, Chris Burnham, Jim Lee, Jason Fabok, and Tony Daniel. Single page artwork included work by Kelley Jones, Mike Allred, Patrick Gleason, and Jock.

===2016–present===

In February 2016, DC Comics announced that as part of the company&#x27;s continuity relaunch called DC Rebirth, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; would resume its original numbering system with June 2016&#x27;s issue #934. The 52 issues of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; volume 2 (2011–2016) were added to the original count of 881 issues from &quot;Detective Comics&quot; volume 1 (1937–2011), making &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #934 the premier issue following the end of the DC Rebirth initiative. The series was published twice-monthly.

The creative team beginning with issue #934 included writer James Tynion IV and artists Eddy Barrows and Alvaro Martinez. The series featured a team led by Batman and Batwoman (Kate Kane), operating out of a secondary base in the heart of Gotham known as the Belfry. Team members initially included Red Robin (Tim Drake), Spoiler (Stephanie Brown), Orphan (Cassandra Cain) and Clayface (Basil Karlo), with Batwing (Luke Fox) and Azrael (Jean-Paul Valley) later recruited as new members. Zatanna also briefly joins the team as a guest star in several issues. This status quo ended with the conclusion of Tynion&#x27;s run on the series in issue #981, published May 2018. During the interim period without a permanent writer, Bryan Edward Hill wrote the story arc &quot;On the Outside&quot; starring Batman, Orphan, Signal, Katana and Black Lightning over issues #983–987 as a prelude to his ongoing series &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;. The next regular writer, Peter Tomasi, began on the series with issue #994, published December 2018. Tomasi&#x27;s run as writer continued for two years until issue #1033, published December 2020.

On March 27, 2019, DC Comics released the series&#x27; 1,000th issue, marking the second American comic book in history to reach that milestone after &quot;Action Comics&quot; in 2018. The issue, which coincided with Batman&#x27;s 80th anniversary, is an anthology featuring several stories from a variety of different creative teams.

Writer Mariko Tamaki began on the series with issue #1034 as part of the Infinite Frontier line-wide relaunch. In April 2022, it was announced that Ram V and Rafael Albuquerque would serve as the new creative team starting with issue #1062.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===

The New 52 saw every DC Comics series collected in its entirety in trade paperback form. Notably, collected volumes of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; vol. 2 were published in hardcover editions first, with paperback editions being delayed until the release of the next hardcover volume.

Material from &quot;Detective Comics&quot; vol. 2 was also included in several collections of crossover events, each printed in both hardcover and softcover. In each case, the material consisted of tie-ins to the main event.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot; to present===

Numbering on the collected editions was restarted from volume 1 with the start of Peter Tomasi&#x27;s run as writer in issue #994. The first three volumes were published in hardcover editions first, before being reprinted in paperback.

===&quot;Millennium Editions&quot;===
In 2000 and 2001, DC reprinted several of its most notable issues in the &quot;Millennium Edition&quot; series. Seven issues of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; were reprinted in this format.

<text>The patriarchal priesthood (or Abrahamic priesthood) is associated with the patriarchal order found in Mormonism and is especially connected with celestial marriage.

In the largest Latter Day Saint denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the patriarchal priesthood is sometimes confused as one of the types or &quot;orders&quot; of priesthood, however, there are only two orders: the Aaronic priesthood and the Melchizedek priesthood; the patriarchal priesthood should also not be confused with the calling of the patriarch. Boyd K. Packer, an LDS Church apostle, has explained that the patriarchal priesthood is included in the Melchizedek priesthood:

==History==
In Nauvoo, Illinois on August 27, 1843, while the Nauvoo Temple was being constructed, Joseph Smith, the first president of the restored Church of Christ, taught, using Hebrews as background material, the &quot;Three Grand Orders&quot; of priesthood:

:There are three grand orders of priesthood referred to here.

:1st. The King of Shiloam (Salem) had power and authority over that of Abraham, holding the key and the power of endless life ... The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right from the eternal God, and not by descent from father and mother; and that priesthood is as eternal as God Himself, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.

:The 2nd Priesthood is Patriarchal authority. Go to and finish the temple, and God will fill it with power, and you will then receive more knowledge concerning this priesthood.

:The 3rd is what is called the Levitical Priesthood, consisting of priests to administer in outward ordinances, made without an oath; but the Priesthood of Melchizedek is by an oath and covenant.

:The Holy Ghost is God&#x27;s messenger to administer in all those priesthoods.

Eight years earlier, Smith had dictated a revelation that declared, &quot;There are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood&quot;. At the time of the 1843 Nauvoo discourse, the temple was under construction and Smith declared that knowledge of the &quot;patriarchal authority&quot; would be revealed in the temple. 

The Nauvoo Temple was constructed by 1844 and dedicated in 1846 by Orson Hyde. It was the first Latter Day Saint temple where the ordinance of celestial marriage was practiced. 

The oath of the priesthood referenced in , was revealed to Smith in a revelation in Kirtland, Ohio on September 22 and 23, 1832. This revelation is contained in the section 84 of the Doctrine and Covenants and is referred to as &quot;the oath and covenant of the priesthood&quot;. It includes the following promise that has relation to the doctrine of exaltation. 

:&quot;They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.
:&quot;And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;
:&quot;For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;
:&quot;And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;
:&quot;And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Father’s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.
:&quot;And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.&quot;

Bruce R. McConkie wrote regarding the subject: 

:&quot;Those who shall hereafter rule and reign in eternity as exalted beings will form a patriarchal chain which will begin with Father Adam and spread out until every exalted person is linked in. Exaltation consists in the continuation of the family unit in eternity, and every family which so continues will find its proper place in the eternal organizational framework which the Almighty has ordained. None will be forgotten. Unworthy mortal links will be dropped in eternity, for there is no family in which all generations will attain exaltation; later generations of worthy families will be welded into the links formed by their ancestors who became worthy of a like exaltation with them. All those after the day of Abraham (of whatever literal lineage they may be) who so live as to be worthy of a place in this great patriarchal chain will be welded into Abraham&#x27;s lineage and shall rise up and bless him as their father.&quot;

The word &quot;patriarch&quot; means &quot;Father-Ruler&quot; and part of the doctrine of the LDS Church is that there cannot be a patriarch without a matriarch. Latter-day Saints believe that a man and a woman can be joined in marriage for all eternity if done with the proper authority and in the temple. This celestial marriage is at the heart of the patriarchal order of the priesthood.

<text>A grassroots movement is one that uses the people in a given district, region or community as the basis for a political or continent movement. Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from volunteers at the local level to implement change at the local, regional, national, or international levels. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision-making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures.

Grassroots movements, using self-organization, encourage community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community. Grassroots movements utilize a variety of strategies from fundraising and registering voters, to simply encouraging political conversation. Goals of specific movements vary and change, but the movements are consistent in their focus on increasing mass participation in politics. These political movements may begin as small and at the local level, but grassroots politics as Cornel West contends are necessary in shaping progressive politics as they bring public attention to regional political concerns.

The idea of grassroots is often conflated with participatory democracy. The Port Huron Statement, a manifesto seeking a more democratic society, says that to create a more equitable society, &quot;the grass roots of American Society&quot; need to be the basis of civil rights and economic reform movements. The terms can be distinguished in that grassroots often refers to a specific movement or organization, whereas participatory democracy refers to the larger system of governance.

== History ==
The earliest origins of &quot;grass roots&quot; as a political metaphor are obscure. In the United States, an early use of the phrase &quot;grassroots and boots&quot; was thought to have been coined by Senator Albert Jeremiah Beveridge of Indiana, who said of the Progressive Party in 1912, &quot;This party has come from the grass roots. It has grown from the soil of people&#x27;s hard necessities&quot;.

In a 1907 newspaper article about Ed Perry, vice-chairman of the Oklahoma state committee, the phrase was used as follows: &quot;In regard to his political views Mr. Perry has issued the following terse platform: &#x27;I am for a square deal, grass root representation, for keeping close to the people, against ring rule and for fair treatment. A 1904 news article on a campaign for possible Theodore Roosevelt running mate Eli Torrance quotes a Kansas political organizer as saying: &quot;Roosevelt and Torrance clubs will be organized in every locality. We will begin at the grass roots&quot;.

Since the early 1900s, grassroots movements have been widespread both in the United States and in other countries. Major examples include parts of the American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, Brazil&#x27;s land equity movement of the 1970s and beyond, the Chinese rural democracy movement of the 1980s and the German peace movement of the 1980s.

A particular instantiation of grassroots politics in the American Civil Rights Movement was the 1951 case of William Van Til working on the integration of the Nashville Public Schools. Van Til worked to create a grassroots movement focused on discussing race relations at the local level. To that end, he founded the Nashville Community Relations Conference, which brought together leaders from various communities in Nashville to discuss the possibility of integration. In response to his attempts to network with leadership in the black community, residents of Nashville responded with violence and scare tactics. However, Van Til was still able to bring blacks and whites together to discuss the potential for changing race relations, and he was ultimately instrumental in integrating the Peabody College of Education in Nashville. Furthermore, the desegregation plan proposed by Van Til&#x27;s Conference was implemented by Nashville schools in 1957. This movement is characterized as grassroots because it focused on changing a norm at the local level using local power. Van Til worked with local organizations to foster political dialogue and was ultimately successful.

The Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST) was founded in the 1970s and has grown into an international organization. The MST focused on organizing young farmers and their children in fighting for a variety of rights, most notably the right to access land. The movement sought organic leaders and used strategies of direct action such as land occupations. It largely maintained autonomy from the Brazilian government. The MST traces its roots to discontent arising from large land inequalities in Brazil in the 1960s. Such discontent gained traction, particularly after Brazil became a democracy in 1985. The movement focused especially on occupying land that was considered unproductive, thus showing that it was seeking overall social benefit. In the 1990s the influence of the MST grew tremendously following two mass killings of protestors. Successful protests were those in which the families of those occupying properties receiving plots of land. Although the grassroots efforts of the MST were successful in Brazil when they were tried by the South African Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM) in 2001 they were not nearly as successful. Land occupations in South Africa were politically contentious and did not achieve the positive results seen by the MST.

The National People&#x27;s Congress was a grassroots democratic reform movement that came out of the existing Chinese government in 1987. It encouraged grassroots elections in villages all around China with the express purpose of bringing democracy to the local level of government. Reforms took the form of self-governing village committees that were elected in a competitive, democratic process. Xu Wang from Princeton University called the Congress mutually empowering for the state and the peasantry in that the state was given a renewed level of legitimacy by the democratic reforms and the peasantry was given far more political power. This manifested itself in increased voting rate, particularly for the poor, and increased levels of political awareness according to Wang&#x27;s research. One example of the increased accountability from the new institutions was a province in which villagers gave 99,000 suggestions to the local government. Ultimately, 78,000 of these were adopted indicating a high rate of governmental responsiveness. This movement is considered grassroots because it focuses on systematically empowering the people. This focus manifested itself in the democratic institutions that focused on engaging the poor and in reform efforts that sought to make the government more responsive to the will of the people.

Another instance of a historical grassroots movement was the 1980s German peace movement. The movement traces its roots to the 1950s movement opposing nuclear armament or the &quot;Ban the Bomb&quot; Movement. In the 1980s, the movement became far bigger. In 1981, 800 organizations pushed the government to reduce the military size. The push culminated in a protest by 300,000 people in the German capital Bonn. The movement was successful in producing a grassroots organization, the Coordination Committee, which directed the efforts of the peace movements in the following years. The committee ultimately failed to decrease the size of the German military, but it laid the groundwork for protests of the Iraq war in the 2000s. Further, the movement started public dialogue about policy directed at peace and security. Like the Civil Rights Movement, the German Peace movement is considered grassroots because it focused on political change starting at the local level.

Another example of grassroots in the 1980s was the Citizens Clearinghouse for Natural Waste, an organization that united communities and various grassroots groups in America in support of more environmentally friendly methods of dealing with natural waste. The movement focused especially on African American communities and other minorities. It sought to bring awareness to those communities and alter the focus from moving problematic waste to changing the system that produced such waste. The movement is considered grassroots because it utilized strategies that derived their power from the affected communities. For example, in North Carolina, African American communities lay down in front of dump trucks to protest their environmental impact. The success of these movements largely remains to be seen.

== Strategies of grassroots movements ==

Grassroots movements use tactics that build power from local and community movements. Grassroots Campaigns, a non-profit organization dedicated to creating and supporting grassroots movements in America says that grassroots movements aim to raise money, build organizations, raise awareness, build name recognition, to win campaigns and to deepen political participation. Grassroots movements work toward these and other goals via strategies focusing on local participation in either local or national politics.

Grassroots organizations derive their power from the people; thus their strategies seek to engage ordinary people in political discourse to the greatest extent possible. Below is a list of strategies considered to be grassroots because of their focus on engaging the populace:
* Hosting house meetings or parties
* Having larger meetings—AGMs
* Putting up posters
* Talking with pedestrians on the street or walking door-to-door (often involving informational clipboards)
* Gathering signatures for petitions
* Mobilizing letter-writing, phone-calling and emailing campaigns
* Setting up information tables
* Raising money from many small donors for political advertising or campaigns
* Organizing large demonstrations
* Asking individuals to submit opinions to media outlets and government officials
* Holding get out the vote activities, which include the practices of reminding people to vote and transporting them to polling places.

== Use of online social networks ==
Social media&#x27;s prominence in political and social activism has skyrocketed in the last decade. Influencers on apps like Instagram and Twitter have all become hot spots for growing grassroots movements as platforms to inform, excite and organize.

=== Hashtags ===
Another influential way media is used to organize is through the use of hashtags to group together postings from across the network under a unifying message. Some hashtags that stirred up larger media coverage include the #MeToo movement, started in 2017 in response to sexual assault allegations against prominent figures in the American entertainment industry. Grassroots movements also use hashtags to organize on a large scale on social media. Some examples include:
*BlackLivesMatter, this hashtag demonstrates how what starts as a media campaign can take footing to be a form of embodying an entire movement.
* LoveWins. After the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, supporters used the hashtag #LoveWins.
* Resist: This hashtag, used in cities throughout America, is another example of the power of organization through media platforms. It was used by event planning sites like Meetup.com to bring together members of a community who wanted to get involved politically. It was used in the case of #Resist:Dallas for such purposes.

== Examples ==

===Barry Goldwater 1964 presidential campaign===
The junior senator from Arizona and standard-bearer of conservative Republicans, Barry Goldwater announced his candidacy on January 3, 1964. Goldwater focused on goals such as reducing the size of the federal government, lowering taxes, promoting free enterprise and a strong commitment to U.S. global leadership and fighting communism, which appealed strongly to conservatives in the Republican Party.

Despite vehement opposition from the leaders of his party&#x27;s dominant moderate-liberal wing, such as New York governor Nelson Rockefeller and Michigan governor George Romney; Goldwater secured the Republican nomination. He sparked a grassroots movement among young conservatives by presenting himself as honest, committed and a genuine politician. The majority of his campaign donations were made by individual supporters; and only one-third of donations were greater than $500.

=== Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign ===

The junior United States senator and former Representative from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, formally announced his 2016 presidential campaign on May 26, 2015, on the foundation of reversing &quot;obscene levels&quot; of income and wealth inequality. Sanders stated that he would run an issue-oriented and positive campaign, focusing his efforts on getting corporate money out of politics, raising taxes on the wealthy, guaranteeing tuition-free higher education, incorporating a single-payer healthcare system, fighting against climate change and other key issues.

Those inspired by Sanders were able to elevate the campaign to challenge the Democratic front-runner, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, before ultimately losing. Sanders used his grassroots campaign to receive more than 7 million individual contributions averaging $27, effectively breaking Barack Obama&#x27;s previous individual contribution record in 2008.

=== UK grassroots aid movement ===
In 2015 the refugee crisis became front-page news across the world. Affected by images of the plight of refugees arriving and travelling across Europe, the grassroots aid movement (otherwise known as the people-to-people or people solidarity movement), consisting of thousands of private individuals with no prior NGO experience, began in earnest to self-organise and form groups taking aid to areas of displaced persons. The first wave of early responders reached camps in Calais and Dunkirk in August 2015 and joined forces with existing local charities supporting the inhabitants there. Other volunteers journeyed to support refugees across the Balkans, Macedonia and the Greek islands. Grassroots aid filled voids and saved lives by plugging gaps in the system between governments and existing charities.

=== The Axis of Justice ===
The Axis of Justice (AofJ) is a not-for-profit group co-founded by Tom Morello and Serj Tankian. Its intended purpose is to promote social justice by connecting musicians and music enthusiasts to progressive grassroots ideals. The group appears at music festivals; the most prominent being Lollapalooza in 2003. The Axis of Justice most regularly appears whenever the bands System of a Down or Audioslave are performing. The group also has a podcast on XM Satellite radio and KPFK (90.7 FM), a Pacifica Radio station in Los Angeles, California. The AofJ&#x27;s mission is to connect local music fans to organizations, local and global, aimed at effectively working on issues like peace, human rights and economic justice within communities.

== Criticism ==

=== Top-down vs. bottom-up processing ===
There is an ongoing debate as to whether a bottom-up or top-down approach is better suited to address the problems facing communities. Top-down processing involves large-scale programs or high-level frameworks, often driven by governmental or international action. Top-down processing is great for tracking large scale causal relationships in environmental systems and it has better funding. Top-down processing is typically designed by outsiders who can only perceive a community&#x27;s need and so community needs are often only marginally addressed or not addressed at all. By contrast, bottom-up processing is defined as &quot;observing or monitoring efforts defined and undertaken at the local scale and brought forward to higher-level bodies, often with a focus on supporting outcomes desired by a local community.&quot; Bottom-up processing has &quot;local residents and [POC] co-facilitate the trainings and workshops&quot;—this &quot;empowers participants.&quot; Bottom-up approaches are often not impactful beyond local settings. Grassroots organizations take on a bottom-up approach as they often allow for direct community participation.

=== Issues with horizontal movements ===
Grassroots movements are usually criticized because the recent rise in social media has resulted in leaderless and horizontal movements. Some argue that social movements without a clear hierarchy are far less effective and are more likely to die off.

=== Astroturfing ===

Astroturfing refers to political action that is meant to appear to be grassroots, that is spontaneous and local, but in fact comes from an outside organization, such as a corporation or think tank. It is named after AstroTurf, a brand of artificial grass. An example of astroturfing was the ExxonMobil Corporation&#x27;s push to disseminate false information about climate change. ExxonMobil was largely successful both in disseminating the information through think tanks and in disguising the true nature of the think tanks.

More controversial examples of astroturfing often exhibit some characteristics of a real grassroots organization, but also characteristics of astroturf. Many of President Obama&#x27;s efforts, for example, have been deemed grassroots because of their focus on involving the electorate at large. Critics of Obama have argued that some of these methods are in fact astroturfing because they believe that Obama faked the grassroots support. For example, the Reason Foundation has accused Obama of planting astroturf supporters in town hall meetings. Many movements and organizations must be placed on a continuum between grassroots and astroturf instead of labeled entirely as one or the other. For example, Australia&#x27;s Convoy of No Confidence, a movement seeking to force an early election in 2011, incorporated elements of grassroots infrastructure in its reliance on the anger and discontentment of the participants. It also had elements of astroturf, namely the large extent to which it relied on support from political elites in the opposition party.

The Tea Party, a conservative force in American politics that began in 2009, is also a controversial example of astroturfing. Critics, notably including Former President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, dismissed the Tea Party as Astroturf. They say that the movement purports to represent large swaths of America when in reality it comes from a select few billionaires seeking policies favorable to themselves. The Tea Party has defended itself, arguing that it comes out of broad popular support and widespread anger at the Democratic Party and disenchantment with the GOP. Defenders of the Tea Party cite polls that find substantial support, indicating that the movement has some basis in grassroots politics. Critics point to the corporate influence on the Tea Party, which they believe indicates that the movement is more top-down than the grassroots rhetoric would suggest. The Tea Party can be considered grassroots to the extent that it comes from the people, but it is considered astroturfing to the extent that it is shaped by corporations and particularly wealthy individuals.

==Current examples==

* &quot;Earth Hour&quot; International - Created by WWF Australia and advertising agency Leo Burnett Sydney and Fairfax Media, has described itself as &quot;the world&#x27;s largest grass roots movement&quot;
* &quot;Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016&quot;: this has been deemed by some as a grassroots campaign because of its focus on small donations, massive rallies and other grassroots style politicking methods.
* &quot;Momentum&quot; in the United Kingdom: it has been described as a grassroots movement supportive of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party.

===Use in sport===
The term &quot;grassroots&quot; is used by a number of sporting organizational bodies to reference the lowest, most elementary form of the game that anyone can play. Focusing on the grassroots of a sporting code can lead to greater participation numbers, greater support of professional teams/athletes and ultimately provide performance and financial benefits to the organization to invest into the growth and development of the sport. Some examples of this are FIFA&#x27;s Grassroots Programme and the Football Federation Australia&#x27;s &quot;Goals for Grassroots&quot; initiative.

<doc id="451917" wikidata="Q6802915" url="?curid=451917" title="Me &amp; Max">
<text>Me &amp; Max is a situation comedy produced for Canadian television station CHCH-TV in 1985.

Evolving out of the sketch comedy series &quot;Smith &amp; Smith&quot;, &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot; starred husband-and-wife comedy team Steve Smith and Morag Smith, and their kids Max and David. All four members of the Smith family played fictionalized versions of themselves, and Steve and Morag also played other characters, such as the neighbours and the boys&#x27; uncle Red Green, through split-screen photography.

The series lasted for 26 episodes, at which time Steve and Morag Smith went on to produce another sketch comedy series, &quot;The Comedy Mill&quot;. Following the end of that show&#x27;s run, Steve Smith developed another series, &quot;The Red Green Show&quot;. The character of Red Green had appeared in all of the Smiths&#x27; previous shows, including &quot;Me &amp; Max&quot;.

<doc id="451919" wikidata="Q641613" url="?curid=451919" title="The Amazing Race">
<text>The Amazing Race is an adventure reality competition franchise in which teams of two people race around the world in competition with other teams. &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; is split into legs, with teams tasked to deduce clues, navigate themselves in foreign areas, interact with locals, and perform physical and mental challenges that often highlight aspects of a location&#x27;s culture, history, or economy. Over the course of the Race, teams travel by airplanes, helicopters, trucks, bicycles, taxicabs, cars, trains, buses, boats and by foot. Teams are progressively eliminated at the end of most legs for being the last to arrive at designated Pit Stops, until only three remain. The first team to arrive at the finish line is awarded the grand prize.

Created by Elise Doganieri and Bertram van Munster, the original series has aired in the United States since 2001 and has earned thirteen Primetime Emmy Awards, ten of them for &quot;Outstanding Reality-Competition Program&quot;. Emmy-award-winning New Zealand television personality Phil Keoghan has been the host of the American version of the show since its inception. The show has branched out to include a number of international versions following a similar format.

== The Race ==

Each race depicted in &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; is broken up into a number of legs. In each leg, teams generally leave the Pit Stop of the previous leg and travel to a different location, where they perform two or more tasks – often including one Detour and one Roadblock – before being given instructions to go to the next pit stop. It is every team&#x27;s goal to complete each leg as quickly as possible, as the last team to arrive at the pit stop is usually eliminated from the competition. 

=== Teams ===

Typically, each season features eleven teams, each composed of two people with a pre-existing relationship. Original show rules required that teammates have a pre-existing relationship of more than three years and no previous acquaintance with other racers during that cycle. Individual racers must be of a specific nationality and meet specific age requirements; this is necessary to allow teams to obtain the necessary passport documentation to travel across the world without incident.

The team format has varied in some seasons. Five American seasons featured twelve teams of two rather than eleven, while the &quot;Family Edition&quot; featured ten teams of four racers, some of whom were young children. The twenty-sixth and twenty-ninth seasons included teams made up of people who met for the first time just prior to the start of the race.

Normally unseen, a two-person production crew, one recording audio and the other recording video, accompanies every team. Generally, teams may not travel without their production crew, who are switched among teams after each leg to avoid biases from developing.

=== Money ===
At the beginning of each leg, each team receives a cash allowance with their first clue, which they must use to cover all expenses except for airfare, which is covered by a production-provided credit card. In the eighth season, this card could also be used to purchase gasoline. Allowance money is usually given in U.S. dollars regardless of location. The amount of money varies from leg to leg. Teams are allowed to keep any unused money for future legs, barring certain penalties for finishing last.

If team members spend all of their money or have it taken away in a non-elimination leg, they may then attempt to obtain more money in any way that does not violate local laws; this includes borrowing money from other teams, begging from locals, or selling their possessions. Since the seventh season, teams have been prevented from begging at United States airports, and teams may not use their personal possessions to barter payment for services.

=== Route markers ===

Route markers are uniquely-colored flags that mark the places where teams must go. Most route markers are attached to the boxes that contain clue envelopes, but some may mark the places where the teams must go in order to complete tasks, or may be used to line courses that the teams must follow.

The route markers used in the first season were yellow and white. They were changed to yellow and red in the second season, and this has remained the standard color scheme since. Occasionally, different color schemes are adopted for certain legs, seasons, or versions of the race.
=== Clues ===
When teams start a leg, arrive at route markers, or complete tasks, they normally receive a yellow letter-sized tear-away envelope with the series&#x27; logo that contains their next clue inside a vertical-fold folder. The clues themselves are typically printed on a vertical strip of paper, although additional information is often provided inside the clue folder. After retrieving the clue, teams open the envelope and must read aloud the instructions given on the clue sheet, then follow those instructions. Teams are generally required to collect every clue during each leg and keep that information with them until they reach the next Pit Stop, surrendering them once they have checked in. Teams may not take an additional clue from the clue box should they lose their first one; teams who do so are assessed a penalty. Teams are not directly penalized for misplacing their clue but will lose time either searching for it or trying to learn from other teams of where to go next.

At route markers, clue envelopes are placed inside a box mounted to the marker. In early seasons, the box contained exactly the number of clues for teams on that leg, allowing teams to indirectly determine their current placement in the leg by counting envelopes. In more recent seasons, extra envelopes are left in clue boxes to prevent this from occurring.

In some cases, clues – most often of the Route Information type – have been provided by more unorthodox means, such as in an advertisement in a local newspaper or on some item related to the task just performed. A common unorthodox means in the American version is to place the clue at the bottom of the Roaming Gnome, the mascot of Travelocity, the former sponsor of the American version.

==== Route Information ====

Route Information clues usually instruct the teams where to go next. Such a clue often provides only the name of the team&#x27;s next destination; it is up to the teams to figure out how to get there. The destination may be given in a cryptic manner, such as a flag representing the country whose capital they are to fly to, or an obfuscation such as the &quot;westernmost point in mainland Europe&quot;. In these cases, teams may use any resources, such as the help of locals or borrowing an Internet-connected device, to deduce the required destination.

Route Information clues will sometimes specify one or more modes of transportation that teams must take. This may include prearranged travel or for charter flights, buses, or boats to more remote locations. Teams may also be provided with a rented vehicle and will be required to navigate themselves with it until further notice. Route Information clues may also restrict teams to specific modes of transport, such as requiring them to walk to their next destination. Teams who fail to follow travel instructions will usually be required to go back and follow them correctly if possible, or else they will receive a penalty at the next Pit Stop (see Penalties and time credits). If no mode of transport is specified, teams are free to use any option available excluding private vehicles.

==== Detour ====

A Detour presents the team with a choice between two tasks, one of which must be completed before the team is allowed to continue. The two tasks are named, often based on rhymes, puns or wordplay - such as &quot;Plow&quot; / &quot;Fowl&quot; to differentiate between a task involving plowing against a task involving corralling ducks. Teams are given several details about both tasks but may need to travel a short distance by foot or car to the different task locations. The two tasks generally involve different skills, often pairing physically demanding or fear-challenging tasks alongside tasks that rely on intelligence or craftsmanship. The decision about which task to attempt lies solely with the team, though due to logistical constraints some Detour options may impose additional limits, such as how many teams may attempt one of the tasks at one time, or the hours when a task may be available. A team may switch tasks as often as they wish with no penalty other than the time lost in attempting the tasks and travelling between task locations. In some Detours, teams that arrived at one of the tasks could not switch. Unless otherwise instructed, teams can work together to finish a Detour option. Once a team has completed one of the tasks, they are given a clue to their next location. A team that is unable to complete either Detour option or opts to quit the Detour will incur a six-hour penalty (24 hours in earlier seasons).

Occasionally, there may be a twist to the Detour format. Season 25 introduced a &quot;Blind Detour&quot;, where competitors were only given the names and locations of the tasks (in some Blind Detours, the tasks will only be vaguely titled like &quot;This&quot; or &quot;That&quot;, further reducing the information available). The fifth Australian season featured a special Blind Detour, in which teams decided their Detour option at an earlier point in the Race (by blindly deciding between Brains and Brawn) and completed their chosen task when they returned to the same location several legs later. Season 26 featured a &quot;Roulette Detour&quot;, where the Detour choice was determined by a spin of a roulette wheel, with Red leading to one task and Black leading to the other. The seventh Canadian season introduced a &quot;One Way&quot; twist that forces a team to perform a specified Detour task.
==== Roadblock ====

A Roadblock is a task that only one team member may perform. A Roadblock clue is given as a cryptic question, such as &quot;&quot;Who&#x27;s really hungry?&quot; (leading to a task involving exotic food) or &quot;Who wants to get down and dirty?&quot;&quot; (for a task related to laundry). Based on this information and observation of any other racers at the task, the team must declare which member will complete the task before reading the full task description. Once a team announces its decision of who will complete the Roadblock, it cannot be changed or taken back. The Roadblock task is performed by only the selected racer while his or her partner waits in a designated area, although the partner is sometimes able to supply words of encouragement and advice. Unless directed by the task instructions, the selected racer may gain help from other racers that have been selected to do the Roadblock or from locals. Some Roadblocks may involve the non-selected racer, such as leading a camel his or her partner rides, or helping his or her partner solve a puzzle. On completing the Roadblock, the selected racer receives their next clue, at which point they may return to their partner and continue on. If a racer is unable to complete a Roadblock, or opts to quit a Roadblock, the team must take a four-hour penalty, which either starts when the next team arrives at the Roadblock, or if all teams are present, when they reach the Pit Stop for that leg. In Seasons 7, 15 and 31 and some foreign versions of the show however, the four-hour penalty was served at the Roadblock location and ended before they could continue racing. Some legs feature two Roadblocks, each of which must be completed by different teammates.

Through the first five seasons, there was no limit on the number of Roadblocks that a single team member could perform throughout the race. In practice, this often led to one team member performing the majority of Roadblocks during the race (the male member of co-ed teams performed most of the Roadblocks in such cases). The rule has changed in Season 6, teams have been limited in the number of Roadblocks each teammate may do over the course of a race, effectively making both racers complete about an equal number of Roadblocks. The new rule has become a traditional norm in subsequent seasons, as well as all international versions.

==== Fast Forward ====

A Fast Forward is an optional task that, once completed, allows the team that completes it to bypass all remaining tasks in the leg and proceed directly to the Pit Stop. The Fast Forward clue is given with another task clue and is a separate task from the others. Only one team may complete a Fast Forward in any given leg, and a team generally may claim only one Fast Forward in the entire race, though Fast Forwards claimed with the Intersection do not count towards this limit. Teams that win a Fast Forward pass are not guaranteed a first-place finish for that leg and still face elimination if they arrive at the Pit Stop last. Multiple teams may attempt Fast Forward tasks, but only the first team to complete the task may claim the pass; all other teams must return to the main course and complete the leg as normal.

Fast Forwards were initially offered on every leg, excluding the final leg. To reduce costs of production involved with unused Fast Forward tasks, the number of Fast Forwards available was reduced to two starting in Season 5, and then down to one in Season 14, or in Season 20, where three Fast Forwards were offered.

Season 18 and Season 19 were the seasons to not feature the Fast Forward for the first time, it was absent again in Seasons 24, 26, and 28, and it has not been featured since Season 30. However, it is still available in some foreign versions.

=== Obstacles ===
Besides clues, teams may encounter the following obstacles, which could affect their placements in a leg:

==== Starting Line Task ====
First introduced in Season 15, the Starting Line Task forces teams to complete a nearby challenge before receiving the clue to their first international destination. Often, the challenge merely determines which teams will receive the right to take the quickest flight; on several occasions, the last team to finish received a penalty to be served later in the race, or in some cases, was immediately eliminated from the race altogether (see Unusual eliminations).

In &quot;The Amazing Race Australia v New Zealand&quot;, the two nations&#x27; teams were pitted against each other in a game of tug of war, with the winning nation&#x27;s teams given a ten-minute head start.

In the fourth and fifth seasons of the Israeli version, the 14 teams were divided into two groups of seven on the first leg; each group began at separate Starting lines, and had separate tasks to complete before reaching the Pit Stop, where the last-place teams in each group were eliminated. The remaining teams were merged at the start of the second leg, at which point the race returned to its standard format. This twist was used again in the sixth Australian season, but unlike the two aforementioned Israeli seasons, it was separated into two legs with the 20 teams divided into two groups of ten for each leg.

==== Yield ====

The Yield, introduced in Season Five, allows any one team to force another team to stop racing for a predetermined amount of time. The Yield marker is placed just before a route marker, and teams are required to stop at it and declare their intentions to employ or decline the Yield. A team choosing to use a Yield must stick a photo of the yielded team on the Yield marker, as well as a smaller photo of themselves onto an attached section labeled &quot;Courtesy of&quot;. When a team who has been yielded arrives at the marker, they must turn over an hourglass and wait for the sand to drain before they are allowed to continue on to the next route marker. Similar to the Fast Forward, a team may use its Yield power only once on the race, and only one team may be yielded at each marker, although a team may be yielded multiple times during the same race. If a team loses its &quot;Courtesy of&quot; photo, they also lose their Yield power. If a team yields a team that has already passed the marker, the Yield is nullified.

When the Yield was introduced, teams would not be warned of any upcoming Yields. Beginning in Season Six, teams were given warning (&quot;Caution, Yield Ahead!&quot;) in the preceding clue that a Yield marker was just ahead. Teams were given opportunities to yield on all but the final leg of Season Five; opportunities were reduced in subsequent seasons until the Yield was replaced by a similar obstacle: the U-Turn. While the Yield was not a presence in the American version for twenty seasons, they are still used within foreign versions. It later made a return to the American version in Season 32, with the opportunity to use was once again restored to every leg except the first and last two legs, and legs where U-Turn appears. It has not been featured since Season 33.

Some variants and twists on the Yield include:
*The second season of the Israeli version and the second season of the Philippine version both allowed teams to vote among themselves for which team would be Yielded later in the leg.
*The inaugural season of the Philippine version introduced the &quot;Anonymous Yield,&quot; in which yielding teams were not required to attach a &quot;Courtesy of&quot; photo, allowing them to keep their identities as secret.
*In Season 32, teams were tasked to find either a 10-minute or a 20-minute hourglass at an early challenge; teams using their Yield later in the race would force the yielded team to wait for the amount of time marked on the hourglass the yielding team found.

==== Pass ====
Introduced in the eighth season of the Canadian version, the Pass is essentially a variation on the Yield, where a team can elect to force another team to stop racing for an undetermined amount of time, and wait to be passed by a third team before they can continue racing. Unlike the Yield, the waiting time for the Pass is indeterminate and the Pass is nullified if used on the team currently in last place.

==== U-Turn ====

The U-Turn, introduced in the 12th American season, allows a team to force another team to complete both Detour tasks in the leg. Similar to the Yield, a U-Turn marker board is placed on the route either immediately before or immediately after the Detour on certain legs and teams must pause at the marker to declare their intentions to employ or decline the U-Turn before continuing. The team choosing to U-Turn must stick a photo of the U-Turned team on the U-Turn marker, and, if required, to identify themselves using a smaller photo placed in a section marked &quot;Courtesy of&quot;. A team generally may exercise their U-Turn power once throughout the race, though the Canadian version has no such limit; similarly, the 29th American season had no limit. This power has no effect if a team that is U-Turned has already passed the marker, and can be negated if a U-Turned team is holding an Express Pass, which can be used to skip one of the detours. One leg of the third Israeli season had a U-Turn before the first of two Detours; the team U-Turned at the first Detour did not carry over to the second Detour. The U-Turned teams must complete one of the Detour tasks before attempting to do the other, as demonstrated in the 35th American season.

Some variants and twists on the U-Turn include:
*The &quot;Blind U-Turn&quot; (or &quot;Anonymous U-Turn&quot;) introduced in the 14th American season, allows teams to U-Turn other teams without identifying themselves.
*The &quot;Double U-Turn&quot;, introduced in Season 17, allows two teams to U-Turn at the same marker. The two teams must U-Turn different teams, though it is possible for the first team U-Turned to then U-Turn another team.
**The &quot;Blind Double U-Turn&quot; (or &quot;Anonymous Double U-Turn&quot;), introduced in the 21st American season, combines the Blind (or Anonymous) and Double U-Turns; both teams who choose to U-Turn may do so anonymously.
**A different variant of the Double U-Turn, as seen in the third Israeli season, was only offered for a team who receives the U-Turn. The first U-Turn was decided by a vote.
*The &quot;Automatic U-Turn&quot;, introduced in the 18th American season, forced the team who came in last in the Starting Line Task to do both tasks of the first Detour. Similarly, the Automatic U-Turn has been used to handicap teams finishing last in that season as well as in the fourth Latin American season.
*The &quot;U-Turn Vote&quot; introduced in the second season of the Israeli version has teams voting for who should be U-Turned with the team(s) receiving the most votes being forced to do both Detour tasks.
**The &quot;Blind U-Turn Vote&quot; introduced in the 35th American season required all teams to anonymously vote to U-Turn another team during the pause between legs, with the U-Turn being applied to the team receiving the most votes. Teams were informed at the start of the race that it would happen, but not when.

====One Way====
Introduced in the seventh season of the Canadian version, the One Way is a variation of the U-Turn that can elect a team to force another team to do a specific task of the Detour.

==== Intersection ====

The Intersection, introduced in Season 10, requires each team to pair up with one other team; the two teams are to perform all tasks and make decisions together until further notice. Both teams must choose the same Detour option, and if a Fast Forward is offered, both teams may claim credit. During Roadblocks, each team must contribute a team member to do the task.

When a team arrives at the Intersection marker and no other team is already waiting, it must wait there until another team arrives. A team may opt not to partner with a particular team, though it must then wait for another team to arrive. Teams are free to choose their partner team if multiple teams are present. In the second and third seasons of the Chinese celebrity edition, teams voted for the team they wished to pair with.

The Intersection was absent from Seasons 12 to 15. After a brief return during season 16, the Intersection was absent from the American edition until season 37. However, it is still a regular feature in some foreign versions, most notably the Australian version, which has featured at least one in each season.

==== Head-to-Head ====
The Head-to-Head forces teams to compete against each other one-on-one in a specific task. The winning team is given the next clue (or is allowed to check in at the nearby Pit Stop), while the losing team(s) must wait for the next team&#x27;s arrival to start the task over. In one variation, the Head-to-Head appears in the middle of a leg, and the team that loses the last round will often receive a penalty – most often a predetermined time penalty – before receiving the next clue. In another variation, introduced in Season 30, the Head-to-Head was placed immediately before the Pit Stop, with winning teams allowed to check in; the last two remaining teams would then battle it out, with the losing team declared to be in last place, and this variation has not been featured since Season 32. 

This twist was first introduced in the second Latin American season and the second Norwegian season as the &quot;Intersection&quot; (not to be confused with the collaborative obstacle outlined above), and it has appeared in other versions under different names, including &quot;Double Battle&quot; (Israeli version), &quot;Versus&quot; (first and second seasons of the Chinese celebrity edition), &quot;Face Off&quot; (third and fourth seasons of the Chinese celebrity edition and the Canadian version) and &quot;Duel&quot; (Philippine version).

==== T-Junction ====
Occasionally, teams will be forced to team up to compete against other paired up teams – this can either be for a single challenge or an entire leg. The &quot;T-Junction&quot; name comes from the twist that was intended to be introduced on the fifth Australian season, but earlier seasons featured similar twists.

The first instance of this was &quot;The Amazing Race Australia v New Zealand&quot;, where teams occasionally competed in &quot;Nation vs Nation&quot; challenges – teaming up with teams from their country in a challenge against teams from the other country.

Another variation of the twist was used on the second and third seasons of the Chinese celebrity edition. This twist titled &quot;Intersection with Integration Versus&quot; in the second season and &quot;Combined Intersection and Face Off&quot; in the third season forced the four remaining teams to pair up as in the Intersection. Within each pair, the two teams would face off in a best-of-five series of challenges over the course of the leg; the two teams who finished best in each pair are declared tied for first place in the leg; the two losing teams face off in a final challenge, with the losing team declared the last-place team.

The fifth Australian season, which intended to feature the T-Junction had teams to join up to form two super-teams and perform all tasks in one leg as a group. The first team to reach the T-Junction would determine who would be in which super-team. The second super-team to check-in at the Pit Stop would then have to decide which pair from their super-team to eliminate from the race.

==== Hazard ====
The Hazard, only seen in Season 19 to date, is a penalty task that must be performed by the team who came in last at the Starting Line Task, similar to the Speed Bump.
==== Switchback ====
A Switchback is a challenge in which teams encounter a task from a previous season that was markedly difficult or memorable. The Switchback is associated with the same country or city as the original task, and often done at the same specific location. For example, the first Switchback in Season 15 recreated a hay-rolling Roadblock from Season 6&#x27;s visit to Sweden; and a Switchback in Season 27 forced teams to free fall into the Batoka Gorge and swing above the Zambezi River, as was done in the first leg of the inaugural season. The 10th season of the Canadian version featured multiple Switchbacks, reflecting on the 10th anniversary of the series. 

Besides noting the challenge&#x27;s noteworthy history, the Switchback does not affect the race&#x27;s game mechanics.

==== Invasion ====
Some versions of the show may introduce new racers part-way into the race. The first instance of such a twist was the &quot;Invasion&quot; twist on the second season of the Chinese celebrity edition, where intruder teams had the opportunity to enter the competition mid-season should they finish a leg with a sufficiently high placement as pre-determined. If the invasion was successful, they would be allowed to continue in the race and the last placing team of the original teams would be eliminated. If the invasion was not successful, the new team would be eliminated regardless of the placement and the remaining teams would all continue onto the next leg. This twist was not used in later seasons of the Chinese celebrity edition, except for a team arriving on the second leg of the fourth season of the Chinese celebrity edition due to prior commitments. The first leg was a non-elimination round to account for this late arrival. Additionally, this late arrival team did not have to achieve a particular placement.

The fifth Australian season also featured new racers mid-race, calling them &quot;Stowaway Teams&quot;. The &quot;Stowaway Team&quot; did not have to achieve a particular placement in their debut leg, they simply arrived and were treated like normal racers (with a last-place check-in eliminating the team).

A similar game-mechanic was used in earlier in the fifth Australian season as well as on the 33rd American season and the eighth Canadian season to re-introduce the most recently eliminated teams to account for the unexpected withdrawal of racing teams. In the fifth Australian season, this was because one team left for mental health concerns. In the 33rd American season, this was because four teams had extenuating circumstances (work, American work visa expiry, pregnancy and a funeral) following a 19-month hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, the two returning teams from that season were given a Speed Bump task as penalty for returning following their elimination (however, this task went unaired in the episode). And in the fourth leg of the eighth Canadian season, this was because three teams tested positive for COVID-19. Additionally like the 33rd American season, there was a Speed Bump task given the two returning teams from that season. This was later used in the sixth leg of the eighth Canadian season to reintroduce the teams that tested positive for COVID-19, but have recovered shortly after. Those teams had to compete in an On-Ramp task to return to the race, with the losing team not allowed to return. The sixth Australian season reintroduced the teams that recovered from COVID-19 as well, and those had to complete a task with a Speed Bump aspect on the leg in which they returned.

==== Partner swap ====
The partner swap, first seen in the 30th American season, requires teams to swap partners for the remainder of a leg, then reuniting at the Pit Stop. The twist was later utilized by the 9th Israeli season.

==== Double-length legs, no-rest legs and mega legs ====
Some seasons have included one or more double-length legs where teams complete two sets of tasks (usually a second Roadblock and second Detour challenge, as well as other Route Info challenges) before arriving at the next Pit Stop, and airs as two episodes on the show. Usually, teams will be led to the show&#x27;s host with a clue that implies that a Pit Stop is ahead, but are surprised as they are not checked in at a Pit Stop but instead are given a clue to continue racing.

Double-length legs were born out of necessity during season six. The sixth leg in Hungary was initially planned as two legs, with the first leg being a non-elimination leg; however, producers later discovered during the race that begging is illegal in Hungary, which would have made it nearly impossible for the last place team to acquire the money needed to continue in the race (per the non-elimination penalty used at the time, would have stripped them of their travel money and start the following leg with no money). The producers quickly devised the extended leg to mimic the effects of a non-elimination leg (by keeping the same number of teams in the race and allow for the same number of episodes to still be produced), and using a simple video message clue to provide teams the goal for the first task of the second half of the leg.

A variant of this introduced in Season 14 is the no-rest leg, also known as the &quot;continue racing&quot; leg (or called the &quot;marathon leg&quot; in the Australian version), in which teams are checked in at a Pit Stop as normal, after which they are told that the next leg is to begin immediately and are handed their next clue. Typically all teams can continue racing onto the next leg at a no-rest Pit Stop. Usually, in both cases, teams who arrived first at a midpoint or Pit Stop first are not awarded a prize, nor facing elimination or a non-elimination penalty if they came last, except a few cases whereas a team is eliminated during this point of the leg (see Unusual eliminations).

Another variant of this introduced in Season 32 is the mega leg, in which the number of Roadblocks and Detours and the distance are doubled. Unlike the double-length leg and the no-rest leg, there is no Pit Stop in the middle of the leg.

==== City Sprint ====
Introduced in the 32nd American season, teams complete a series of tasks while racing in the city before returning to the starting point, doubling as the leg&#x27;s Pit Stop. None of the tasks involved in the sprint contain Detours or Roadblocks.

==== Scramble ====
Introduced in the 34th American season, the Scramble is an obstacle where teams are given three tasks, which can be performed in any order. Completing each task gives a portion of the clue that reveals the location of their ultimate destination.

==== Fork in the Road ====
Introduced in the 37th American season, the Fork in the Road is an obstacle where teams are given the option of two race routes to the Pit Stop with one team from each route eliminated at the end of the leg.

=== Pit Stop ===
The Pit Stop is the final destination in each leg. Once teams have arrived there and checked in, they are given lodging (which can range from simple accommodations such as tents or cots to complete hotel service) and food free of charge as they wait for the next leg to begin. Teams will also give interviews with the production team to describe their activities from the last leg; this is interspersed during episode footage of that leg on the subsequent broadcast. Teams are generally sequestered to the lodgings but may otherwise use their time freely. In early seasons, teams were allowed to socialize with each other at Pit Stops, but between Season 14 and Season 25, teams were sequestered from each other, and often would not learn of the previous elimination until they saw other teams on the next leg. Following Season 25, teams have occasionally been allowed to mingle with other teams during Pit Stops.

==== Pit Start ====
The Pit Start is the first destination where teams start each leg. Originally, teams would start the leg exactly 12 hours after the moment they reached the previous leg&#x27;s Pit Stop mat – before accounting for any time credits or penalties accrued in the previous leg. These breaks could be extended by 24-hour increments as needed as to appear 12 hours long during the broadcast. In more recent seasons, time lengths have varied to avoid teams loitering in airports or other areas. Teams are responsible for being ready to leave at the correct time, and no time credit is given should they miss their departure time due to factors such as oversleeping.

=== Non-elimination legs ===
In most races, a number of legs are predetermined &quot;non-elimination legs,&quot; where the last team to check in at the pit stop is not eliminated. Up through the fourth season, there was no penalty for finishing last on a non-elimination leg. With the fifth season, teams who finished in last place in a non-elimination leg were subject to a penalty on the following leg, usually one of the following:
* Stripped of money (and belongings or vehicles): In the fifth through ninth seasons, the last team to check in was stripped of all their money and was not given any money at the start of the next leg. From seasons seven through nine, teams were also forced to give up their bags and possessions, leaving them with only the clothes they happened to be wearing and the fanny packs, which contained their passports and &quot;Race&quot; documentation.
* Marked for elimination: In the tenth and eleventh seasons, the team that finished last on a non-elimination leg was &quot;marked for elimination&quot; on the next leg; should they fail to finish first on the leg, they would be subject to a 30-minute penalty before being allowed to check in at the Pit Stop.

* Speed Bump: From the twelfth season on, the team that finishes last in a non-elimination leg has to perform a penalty task at some point during the next leg. This task must be completed before the team is allowed to continue racing. If the team fails to complete the Speed Bump, they receive a 4-hour penalty at the Pit Stop.
Beginning with season 34, the American version has forgone planned non-elimination legs, instead choosing to include a larger cast than normal (13 or 14 teams) or include an extended Mega Leg (split over two episodes) to ensure that all legs feature an elimination.

==== Other non-elimination penalties ====
Other international versions of the &quot;Race&quot; had different non-elimination penalties that issued to the last-placed teams:

* Handicap (&quot;Handikap&quot; in Norwegian): Featured in the Norwegian version, teams were handicapped to a specific task by making the task more difficult for the team with the penalty, such as increasing the output requirements for a task (e.g., teams only have to make 50 items at the task, but the team with the Handicap has to make 75) or a penalty may be given, such as requiring both Detours to be done. If the team fails to complete or opts to quit the Handicap, they will receive a four-hour penalty at the Pit Stop. The Speed Bump in the 27th American season and the fourth Australian season resemble the Handicap penalty.
* In the fifth leg of the third Israeli season, the team was required to wear their winter clothing throughout the next leg, which was hot.
* In the seventh leg of the third Israeli season, the team that came last would have to wait an extra 30 minutes before departing on the next leg. This is called a Delayed Start. It was later repeated in the second and sixth Vietnamese seasons, although in the sixth Vietnamese season, the team that came last would have to wait an extra 90 minutes before departing.
* In the first leg of the seventh Israeli season, the team would be on a flight that arrived two hours after the other teams landed in their first destination.
* In the inaugural Vietnamese season, a &quot;Stripped of money and belongings&quot; variant of the &quot;Marked for Elimination&quot; penalty was featured, where the team that came in last on some non-elimination legs was stripped of all their money (and in addition to not acquiring any money at the start of the following leg) should they fail to finish first in the next leg.
* In the second season of the Chinese celebrity edition, two (of the four) non-elimination legs had the penalty on the rest period of the teams instead of a &quot;Speed Bump&quot; (Leg 3 had the last team stay in a shop for a night sleeping on the ground, while Leg 8 was given tickets to fly in economy class instead of business class (which is usually the case in the series)).
* In the Ukrainian version, three non-elimination legs had different penalties. In Legs 2 and 8, the team would receive a 30-minute (Leg 2) or 1-hour (Leg 8) penalty to take regardless of their position. In Leg 11, the team would have to complete an extra task.
* On the fifth Australian season, the leg winner had the privilege of delegating between the bottom two teams a Salvage (to assist the team), and a Sabotage (to penalise the team).
** The Salvage was an advantage given to the receiving team. For example, the team may receive a personal driver for the next leg, the ability to skip queues, or a local guide to accompany them.
** The Sabotage was a penalty given to the receiving team, much like a traditional non-elimination penalty listed above.
* Due to changing the rules of the Speed Bump and restrictions of traveling during COVID-19 pandemic in the 33rd American season, teams who arrived last on a non-elimination leg, would start the next leg singled-out in the final departure group. Following a positive COVID-19 test during the 34th American season, this penalty made an unexpected return (as the COVID positive team served as that leg&#x27;s elimination).

=== Unusual eliminations ===
There have been many eliminations which have been unusual, which may involve a team being eliminated outside a Pit Stop or more than one team being eliminated. Sometimes, an elimination point is placed in the middle of a leg as opposed to the end, or, a team may be eliminated during the first task, such as the 15th American season. The 19th American season featured a double-elimination leg, where the last two teams to arrive at a Pit Stop were both eliminated; double-elimination legs have been featured in a few international versions since then. A few no-rest legs across multiple versions have eliminated the last team to arrive at the Pit Stop.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 33rd American season had to halt production indefinitely, in which there were nine teams remaining at the time. When filming resumed 19 months later, four teams were unable to return due to extenuating circumstances and were subsequently removed from the race. Prior to the start of the fifth leg in the 34th American season, one team was removed from the race because one member tested positive for COVID-19.

=== Gameplay Prizes ===
The winners of most legs of the race typically receive a prize (usually from the show&#x27;s sponsors as a form of Product placement) for the team to enjoy after the race. However, occasionally, the first arriving team will win an advantage to assist them in the race. These gameplay prizes can also be awarded for completing additionally optional tasks.

==== Express Pass ====

The Express Pass, introduced in the 17th American season, allows the team who possesses it to skip one task of the team&#x27;s choosing. It is usually awarded as a prize to the first-place team in earlier legs, though occasionally, it is awarded through other mechanics, such as being given to the first team to complete a task, by forcing a team to give a pass to another team of their choosing before a certain leg, or even by random. The choice of which task to skip is at the team&#x27;s discretion, but if the team with the pass is eliminated or the pass is not used by a specific point, the team must give the pass to the host at the Pit Stop. The American version has used two variants on the Express Pass. One, the Double Express Pass, was featured in seasons 22, 23, and 24: the team that won the Express Pass was given a second Express Pass that they had to give to another team. In season 27, the team that won the Express Pass was also given a second pass, but this one had to be given to another team &quot;after&quot; the winners used their pass. The fifth Canadian season introduced another twist of the Express Pass, the Triple Express Pass, in which the team that wins the Express Pass was given two additional Express Passes to be given to two other teams.

====The Assist====
Introduced in the ninth Canadian season, the Assist allows teams to make designated challenges easier. In Season 9, each team received one Assist at the start of the race. All teams had until the sixth leg to use their Assist. In Season 10, one Assist was randomly hidden in a clue at a particular challenge during a leg. The team that found it had to use it for that clue&#x27;s challenge.

==== Salvage Pass ====
The Salvage Pass, introduced in the second Australian season, is awarded to the winners of the first leg. The team who receives the pass may choose to give themselves a one-hour head start for the start of the next leg of the race or save the last team to arrive at the Pit Stop from elimination. The Salvage Pass was also used alongside the Express Pass in Philippine version; however, teams in the Philippine version have the option of using it to gain a 30-minute advantage at a task. The Express Pass featured in the sixth Vietnamese season gave teams the additional option to use their pass to save the last placing team (or second-last placing team on a double elimination leg) – much like the Salvage Pass.

==== First Class Pass ====
The First-Class Pass, introduced in the fifth Australian season, is awarded to the winners of a non-elimination leg. The winners of the pass would be able to skip the next leg and would instead receive a luxury experience while the other teams were racing. Additionally, the First Class Pass holder will allocate &quot;The Salvage&quot; (an advantage to assist the team on the next leg) and &quot;The Sabotage&quot; (a penalty to disadvantage a team) between the Bottom Two teams (see Non-elimination legs).

==== The Save ====
The Save, used in Season 25 and Season 26 (although this was unaired, unclaimed and unused), allows the team holding it to avoid elimination once should they finish last in an elimination leg, up to the ninth leg. The Save can also be given to another team to use if desired. The Save in Season 25 was awarded to the winners of the first leg. In Season 26, it could be obtained during the third leg by willingly completing both sides of the Detour. The Save wasn&#x27;t used on either season, and has not been featured since Season 27.

==== Return Ticket ====
A twist also called the Save was introduced in the Chinese celebrity edition where the team that won it was required to bring another team back into the competition. In the third season, the Save was renamed to &quot;Return Ticket&quot;, and the team that won the ticket could bring back another team before the fourth leg. The sixth Israeli season also incorporated the Return Ticket by bringing back previously eliminated teams to compete a leg, with the winner earning the Return Ticket and the ability to return to the competition. In the eighth season of &quot;The Amazing Race Canada&quot;, this twist was introduced as the On Ramp Pass to bring back two out of three teams temporarily removed due to COVID-19.

==== Double Your Money ====
The Double Your Money prize was a special prize awarded to the winners of the first leg in Season 21. The prize doubles the grand prize from to , should they win the entire race. The team that won the prize on the first leg was eliminated before the final leg and no one was eligible to win and the prize has not been featured since Season 22.

=== Final leg ===
The three remaining teams participate in the final leg, where they are usually flown from the final foreign country to the home country. Sometimes, the Finish Line is held outside the home country, such as in the Brazilian version. Teams must complete all required tasks before they are directed to the Finish Line mat; the first team to arrive there wins the race and claims the reward. In the original American version, the grand prize was a cash prize of . At the check-in mat, the host and the eliminated teams celebrate the arrival of the finalists. 

A typical feature of the final leg is what is unofficially dubbed the &quot;Final Memory Challenge&quot; – an often elaborate challenge which tests the contestants on their time spent during the race, with common examples including memory-based tasks proving their observation skills (such as finding items which they encountered along the race in sequential order) or how well they know their partner. The final task may also relate to the theme of the journey they have taken (such as completing a puzzle of the world) or the final leg (such as counting poker chips amounting to , representing the grand prize). In a few recent seasons, a minor version of a memory challenge appeared in the second or third to last leg.

In the 25th and 26th American seasons, four teams raced the final leg, but at some point during the leg one of the four teams was eliminated from the race. A similar twist was included on the sixth Vietnamese season without the mid-leg elimination, making it the first time in the franchise&#x27;s history four teams crossed the Finish Line. The latter twist was also included in the eighth and tenth Canadian seasons.
=== Rules and penalties ===
All teams must abide by the rules set at the beginning of the race, and teams are given time penalties for any rule infraction, which can negatively affect finishing position in that leg of the race. Usually in a non-elimination leg, if the last team to arrive at the mat is checked in before a previous team has completed its penalty, any remainder of the penalty time will be applied at the start of the next leg of the race, beginning at the departure time of the next-to-last team; in some cases, if multiple teams are penalized and were the last set of teams to arrive, the teams who did not finish last (as long as their penalties does not affect the placements) are allowed to check-in immediately with the penalty to be applied at the start of the next leg. In a no-rest leg, the last team will be given their next clue immediately while any remainder of the penalty will be removed.

==== Rules ====
While the complete set of official rules has not been released to the public, certain rules have been revealed during the various versions of the race:
* Unless otherwise stated, such as during Roadblocks, team members must stay within of each other and stay close to their assigned camera and sound crew. When using any form of transportation, unless otherwise stated, teams must be able to travel with the camera crew. Teams are recorded requesting only two tickets after they have made their initial request for four.
* Teams are required to purchase economy class airfare when they fly, using the credit card provided by the show. The airline, at its discretion, however, may upgrade the team(s) so long as there are no additional costs. Teams may use their cash stipend to purchase first-class fares for other modes of transportation. Teams may be forbidden from flying on certain airlines or restricted to specific airlines or restricted to transit in certain countries varying on seasons.
* Teams are prohibited from contacting friends, family, and acquaintances during the &quot;Race&quot; without supervision. The &quot;Race&quot; however may provide them with an opportunity to contact them at select times. When this happens while the &quot;Race&quot; is going on, teams are not allowed to proceed to their next task. In special circumstances, the production team will allow racers to contact family members outside a race-required task.
* Unless otherwise stated by the clues, teams are allowed to use the help of locals for navigating and during tasks. Teams are required to have any locals who appear on camera sign release forms that legally clear the footage for use; some teams have avoided or reduced contacts with random local strangers because the release process can take a very long time to complete.
* Teams are free to work together at any point unless otherwise stated by the rules. Excluding the use of the Yield and U-Turn, teams are prohibited from hindering the performance of other teams such as by taking extra clues from a clue box, taking another team&#x27;s assigned vehicle, altering the equipment for other teams at a task or using more than one Yield or one U-Turn at a time.
* In any tasks that provide the teams with equipment, tools, animals, guides, or other props, teams are forbidden from changing these mid-task. Teams are forbidden from interfering with such equipment for other teams. When teams are given rental cars, and the car breaks down outside the team&#x27;s control, they will be given a replacement vehicle but given no additional time credits for the time it takes to make the changeover.
* Teams are prohibited from possessing maps, guidebooks, cell phones, personal digital assistants and other similar aids at the start of the &quot;Race&quot;, but may use the provided money to purchase these as they progress. These may be provided by the show if required for a certain task.
* Teams are prohibited from using their personal items to barter for services on the &quot;Race&quot;, though they are not necessarily prohibited from selling them for cash. The teams&#x27; bags may be subject to review during Pit Stops by production. Teams are free to sell or barter any items they have purchased during the &quot;Race&quot;.
* In cases where teams are instructed to walk or drive themselves to a destination, teams are not allowed to hire a taxi to guide or take them through the route. In early seasons of the original series, teams frequently employed this tactic; several exchanges of dialogue in the 17th American season indicate that it is now prohibited.
* Except for The Scramble, teams are required to pick up clues in the correct order. Should a team collect the wrong clue, they are required to cease whatever task(s) they are performing and backtrack to wherever the correct clue was and then perform its associated task(s).
* Teams are expected to keep the &quot;Race&quot; fanny pack containing their cash, passports, clues, and other documents with them at all times. Other items mandated by clues are subject to this requirement. Teams that do not have these upon check-in at a Pit Stop are required to go back and retrieve the pack and any missing mandatory contents (e.g., passports) before being checked in. In one case, during 21st American season, a team had one of their passports stolen by a cab driver during a non-elimination leg that was followed by a leg in the same country. The team was checked-in last for a non-elimination finish and allowed to race in the following leg but would be eliminated if they still lacked their passport by the time they were required to produce one for international travel. Teams may check in after losing or abandoning any non-mandatory items (e.g., items of clothing), but they must continue the &quot;Race&quot; without them.
* Teams must complete each challenge as specified by the clues given to them throughout the &quot;Race&quot;. Should a team fail to properly complete a challenge, violate any provisions made in a clue or task description, or miss a clue altogether (unless specifically allowed to do so, e.g., by winning the Fast Forward, or by using an Express Pass), they must either go back to the location of the challenge and complete the challenge, or incur a penalty when they check in (see Penalties and time credits).
* To check in, all team members must step on the mat. As seen in the 30th American season and later on the eighth Israeli season, legs may end in a photo finish (and in both cases, the close finish was between the last two teams); the last team to step onto the mat was declared last-place team. This rule was also alluded to orally by teams on the fourth Australian season.
* Teams are forbidden from touching another team&#x27;s belongings, such as removing them from a taxi to use the new taxi. However, if the taxi driver removes the items, the team will not be penalized. Teams also may not intentionally hinder another team by hiding materials needed for a task.
* Teams are prohibited from begging where it is illegal. On the American version, teams are additionally prohibited from begging at U.S. airports.
* Team members may not smoke during the &quot;Race&quot;.
* Teams are required to abide by all local laws of the country where they are racing.
* Starting in the 25th American season, teams may only book one travel itinerary for themselves. They were no longer able to book a second set of tickets if they subsequently discovered a second flight that they preferred once they purchased the first booking. DVD commentary for the first season reveals that this was originally a rule, but was dropped for the second season.

The teams are often given additional rules and instructions that apply specifically to a given leg or to a task supplied with one of the clues; these are usually not explained to the viewer unless they affect the &quot;Race&quot; results.

==== Penalties and time credits ====
If a team trying to check in at the Pit Stop has committed an infraction during the leg, the team generally must return to the point of infraction and perform the task or action correctly before being allowed to check in. If it is impossible to correct the action, the team is instead asked to wait at a nearby spot to serve a penalty period before being allowed to officially check-in. The penalty for most rule infractions is 30 minutes, plus any time gained from breaking the rule. Minor violations for various tasks would have a penalty of 15 minutes, while some violations have longer penalties: two hours for bartering personal goods for services, up to four hours for failing to complete a miscellaneous task, four hours for failing to complete a Roadblock or Speed Bump, six hours for failing to complete a Detour (or completing a Fast Forward incorrectly), or 24 hours for flying outside of economy class, if doing so cost more than the economy class fare. Earlier seasons of the Race enforced a 24-hour penalty for not completing either Detour option, but by season 17, the penalty was reduced to six hours. If teams incur multiple penalties, they are cumulative.

A penalized team does not generally have to wait out its full penalty time at the Pit Stop if the team is in last place and all other teams have already checked in; unless if the leg was a non-elimination or a no-rest, the team will be eliminated immediately; otherwise, either the remainder of the penalty will be applied to the team&#x27;s start time on the next leg, or in the event of a no-rest leg, any penalty would be nullified. Occasionally, infractions have come to the production team&#x27;s attention only after the team has checked in; in these cases, the penalty will be applied to the start of the next leg (with viewers given notification if it affects the departure order). In the 3rd American season, such a situation resulted in changing which team finished in last place; production brought the penalized team back to the Pit Stop, where the host explained to the teammates what had happened before their elimination.

Should a vehicle (including cars and boats) break down through no fault of the team using it, a replacement vehicle is provided for them, but &quot;no time credit is given for their wait in this unlucky situation.&quot;

Teams may also receive time credits, applied to the next leg, that results from &quot;production difficulties.&quot; These are only revealed to the viewer if they affect the placement at the start of the next leg.

==== Roadblock penalties ====
In most versions, there is a four-hour penalty for not completing a Roadblock, which is served upon arrival at the Pit Stop. On the American version, the penalty can be enforced in a number of ways:
* If circumstances force the penalized team to continue racing (e.g., the site is about to close for the day), the penalty is served at the Pit Stop.
* If they are not forced to continue racing, and all teams have arrived at the Roadblock, the penalty begins the moment the team announces their intention to quit.
* If they are not forced to continue racing, and at least one team has yet to arrive at the Roadblock, the penalty does not begin until the next team arrives. In two cases, the second Israeli season has only a one-hour penalty for not finishing a Roadblock task, while in the 20th American season, one Roadblock had a task which only had a limited number of props for teams to use in attempting the task; if they ran out, they only had to serve a two-hour penalty before checking in at the Pit Stop.
* If a racer provides illegal assistance to their partner completing a Roadblock, the penalty (usually 30 minutes) is issued at the Pit Stop.

== Production ==
The production of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; is a challenge due to its premise being a race around the world. Among the difficult duties that producers face, scouting out locations, designing tasks, selecting teams, and planning logistics for the entire course are the most important to accomplish in pre-production. During the Race, the camera crews need to keep up with the movement of the teams and the host. And when the footage for the entire season has been recorded and edited, team members, production crew as well as the local staff who hosted or facilitated the tasks are obliged to keep the details of the race confidential and not leak out anything that hints at locations, events, or outcomes of the Race. An exception is the television network that airs the show in a country which hosted one of the legs where they can air teasers such as &quot;Who among the teams will come here to (the network&#x27;s home country name)?&quot; However, in recent American seasons, CBS had released a map to show the locations that the racers would be visiting.

The show is broadcast on CBS in the United States and simulcast via satellite in various networks around the world.

Through its efforts, the American version has received many accolades, including Primetime Emmy Awards and nominations in categories for audio and video production and editing. In 2010, CBS announced that season 18 of the show would be broadcast in high definition.

== International versions ==
The original version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; is the American version, which debuted on CBS on September 5, 2001, with Phil Keoghan as the host. In October 2005, CBS optioned &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; for franchising to other countries.

=== Asia and Oceania ===
&quot;The Amazing Race Asia&quot; was the first Asian version of the show. The regional version was bought by Buena Vista International Television – Asia Pacific (BVITV–AP) and Sony Pictures Television International in October 2005. Auditions were then announced that took place in February to March 2006. The show first aired on November 9, 2006, on AXN Asia and was hosted by Allan Wu. The show aired for three more seasons, with the last season having ended in 2010. After a six-year hiatus, the series was announced to be returning for a 5th season to air in late 2016.

On April 8, 2008, Israeli television network Reshet announced their own their version of the show, &quot;HaMerotz LaMillion&quot; (&#x27;The Race to the Million&#x27;). Its first season premiered on February 5, 2009, on Channel 2. The host for the first season was Raz Meirman, and Ron Shahar hosted from 2011 to 2020. The first four seasons of the show was a co-production by Reshet and activeTV, an Australian production company that had also produced the Asian version of the race. Since the fifth season, the show has been produced in-house by Reshet, and in 2017 Reshet launched their own channel that became the new home of the show starting with the sixth season. After the eighth season, the show went on hiatus for two years until October 2022, when it was announced that the ninth season would be produced by Keshet Media Group and broadcast on Channel 12, with Yehuda Levi serving as the new host. The season premiered in 2024.

In March 2010, a Chinese version of the show, &quot;The Amazing Race: China Rush&quot;, was announced by the Disney–ABC International Television Asia Pacific. The show was produced by Shanghai-based international production company Fly Films; the company had previously produced Shanghai Rush in 2009, a show heavily influenced by &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The first season was filmed between March and April 2010 and aired in August 2010 by International Channel of Shanghai and was hosted by Allan Wu, who had also previously hosted the Asian version. The Chinese version ran for three seasons, with the last season having ended in 2012. In 2014, Shenzhen Media Group announced they had bought the rights to &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; and would be producing a new Chinese version of the program, unrelated to Shanghai Media Group&#x27;s &quot;China Rush&quot;.

On July 19, 2010, Australian channel Seven Network purchased the format rights to produce the Australian series. &quot;The Amazing Race Australia&quot; was produced by activeTV in association with ABC Studios and was distributed by Disney Media Distribution Asia Pacific. The host for the first 3 series was New Zealand-born actor Grant Bowler. Two series were produced in 2011 and 2012 and after a brief hiatus in 2013, a third season was produced in-house and without activeTV in 2014. This series also included teams from both Australia and New Zealand. Following another hiatus for 5 years, the show was revived by Network 10 in 2019. This new series was produced by Eureka Productions and hosted by former rugby league footballer Beau Ryan. The first season of 10&#x27;s iteration – and the fourth season overall – premiered on October 28, 2019. The seventh and eighth seasons were celebrity editions.

On March 26, 2011, it was announced that TV5 had acquired the rights to produce a Philippine version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The first season of &quot;The Amazing Race Philippines&quot; aired on October 29, 2012, and ended on December 15, 2012. Derek Ramsay hosted the show. The show aired a second season in 2014.

Vietnam bought the format as &quot;The Amazing Race Vietnam – Cuộc đua kỳ thú&quot;. It was announced on March 1, 2012, by BHD Corp. and VTV3. Dustin Nguyen served as the director, executive producer and host of the first season of the show. The second, third, and fifth seasons were broadcast with Huy Khánh as the host, with Phan Anh filling in during the fourth season. After a three-year hiatus, the show was revived with Song Luân as host.

During 2005, AXN Central Europe announced a version of the show to be called &quot;The Amazing Race Central Europe&quot;. Applications were closed with the submission of 2,500 applicants, with filming expected to have occurred in 2006 and broadcast from September 2006. The show was cast but was never filmed.

By October 2011, a Norwegian version of the show titled &quot;The Amazing Race Norge&quot; was announced by TV 2. Applications were open from October 11, 2011, to October 31, 2011. Filming took place in January 2012. Ex-football player Freddy dos Santos hosted the show. The first season premiered on April 11, 2012. The second and latest season ended on May 29, 2013.

On April 12, 2023, &quot;Iltalehti&quot; revealed that a Finnish version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot; was being made. Filmed from July 24 to August 16, 2023 and premiered on September 30 on Nelonen, the Finnish &quot;Amazing Race&quot; features celebrity contestants in a race around the world. After a successful adaption of the format, the Finnish version was renewed for a second series, starting late 2024.

In late 2006, a South-American independent production company announced that it would produce a Brazilian version in 2007, to be called &quot;The Amazing Race: A Corrida Milionária&quot;, and to be aired in a purchased time slot in the Brazilian network RedeTV!. Applications were open from January until July, and filming occurred during August and September. The first and only season premiered on October 13, 2007, and concluded on January 5, 2008.

On October 15, 2008, a Latin American version of the show was announced by Discovery Latin America in association with Disney and Harris Whitbeck presented the show. The first season was filmed in early 2009 and broadcast late in that year across Latin America and the Caribbean and the second season aired in late 2010. In January 2011 it was announced that Space acquired the rights to produce the third season of the show. The fourth season also aired on Space in September 2012, but solely composed of Brazilian teams with Paulo Zulu as the host, replacing Whitbeck. In the fifth season, María Victoria &quot;Toya&quot; Montoya, a former contestant from the third season, replaced Whitbeck as regular host of the series.

On November 30, 2012, it was revealed that CTV would produce a Canadian version of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

== Other media ==
=== Video games ===
A video game based on this reality show was developed by Ludia and published by Ubisoft for the Wii. It was released on November 2, 2010, in North America.

The game features many countries previously visited on real races, as well as some new ones like Venezuela. Host Phil Keoghan provided voice-acting throughout the entire game.

Players customize their own characters and can race against other, pre-made characters. These existing teams are showcased in the opening, which closely mirrors the actual show&#x27;s opening (including the use of the same music). However, when playing the actual game, no-one, not even the player, is referred to by name. Instead, teams are differentiated by color (ex. team yellow).

The rules of the race are fairly similar to the actual race. Teams receive money, fly to a location and complete various tasks (which were represented by a large collection of minigames). The last team to arrive is eliminated, unless they are saved by a non-elimination leg, in which the penalty is the team loses all their money they saved up to that point (unlike the show during seasons 5–9, the teams are still given money at the start of the next leg). However, all teams leave the Pit Stop at the same time.

Some clues had changes to their rules: while the Detour and Roadblock retain their rules, there is no limit on individual Roadblocks. Fast Forwards appear in the race, but they are not optional, and the team that completes it the fastest gets a two-hour time credit. The Intersection marker was also present, however, the rules were changed to a task that all teams complete, similar to an additional task on the real race. The Yield, U-Turn, Speed Bump, and Express Pass are not featured in this game.

As an added bonus, completing various tasks and doing certain objectives in the game will unlock &quot;video files.&quot; These are selected clips from the actual American TV show; usually featuring notable clips selected from the first 15 seasons, such as extremely dramatic moments (examples are Uchenna &amp; Joyce could not pay their taxi driver at the final Pit Stop and Chris &amp; Alex making the closest finish in &quot;The Amazing Race 2&quot;) or funny moments (such as when Fran &amp; Barry kept walking past a clue that was within arm&#x27;s length). The clips appear exactly as they did on TV, except that &quot;all&quot; logos are pixelated, even those that went uncensored on TV. 

Ludia and Ubisoft also made a version of the game for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad.

=== Parodies ===
In 2015, a Canadian animated &quot;Amazing Race&quot; parody program titled &quot;The Ridonculous Race&quot; aired on Teletoon and Cartoon Network. The show itself is a spin-off the &quot;Total Drama&quot; series (which is, in turn, a parody of other reality shows, predominantly &quot;Survivor&quot;). The animated show features 18 teams of two who will compete in a race around the world for C$1,000,000. The show is hosted by Don, who is modelled after &quot;The Amazing Race US&quot; host, Phil Keoghan. The teams race to &quot;Don Boxes&quot; to receive their next &quot;travel tip&quot;, which will instruct the teams to complete challenges and go to other locations. Like &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, there are a variety of challenge types. There are &quot;either or&quot;; in which the teams are given a choice of two choices (like a Detour), a &quot;botch or watch&quot;; which only one member of the team can complete the task (like a Roadblock), and &quot;all-ins&quot;; in which both members must complete the given task. At the end of each episode, there is a &quot;Chill Zone&quot; which the teams may rest until the next episode. Teams check into the &quot;chill zones&quot; by stepping on the &quot;carpet of completion&quot;. The last team to set foot on the carpet may be eliminated from the race. The first team to reach the final &quot;chill zone&quot; will win C$1,000,000.

In the adult sitcom show &quot;American Dad&quot;, there is an episode called &quot;The Bitchin Race&quot;, where the show&#x27;s characters compete in a reality show that resembles &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. The episode also featured Phil Keoghan portraying the host of the show himself.

<text>Sally Gerber (born 1927) is the daughter of Daniel Frank Gerber who established the baby food enterprise Gerber Products Company.

Sally Gerber was ill as a baby, and when she was seven months old, her pediatrician recommended a diet of fruits and vegetables which her mother prepared for her daily. Her mother Dorothy soon grew tired of hand-straining fruits and vegetables every day. She turned to her husband &quot;Dan&quot;, owner of the Fremont Canning Company along with his father Frank Daniel Gerber, for help.

<doc id="451927" wikidata="Q272024" url="?curid=451927" title="Bambi Woods">
<text>Bambi Woods is an American former pornographic film actress and exotic dancer best known for her appearance as the title character in the 1978 film &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;. Her success during the Golden Age of Porn and later disappearance fueled speculation that she had died of a drug overdose in 1986.

==Pornographic film career==
Woods was known for her first role as the eponymous character of &quot;Debbie&quot; in the 1978 feature adult film &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;. She received top billing and a photo of her in a bogus uniform was prominently advertised on theater marquees where she was billed as a &quot;former Dallas Cowgirl&quot;. Woods had previously tried out for the real Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, but never made the squad.

Woods said in an interview for the public-access television program &quot;Late Late Blue&quot; that she performed in &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot; as a one-off to clear a debt to a friend, but later spent all her earnings, so the same friend arranged for her to perform striptease. The film&#x27;s producer and director Jim Clark said in an interview for the Channel 4 documentary &quot;Debbie Does Dallas Uncovered&quot; that he created the stage name &quot;Bambi Woods&quot; as an allusion to the Disney character Bambi: &quot;I named her Bambi Woods. There wasn&#x27;t any real reason behind it. Bambi ... a deer. In the woods. Do you want to get deeper?&quot; One reviewer said that Woods&#x27; demeanor during sex scenes was in keeping with her pseudonym, being reminiscent of a deer in headlights.

In the trailer for &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;, Woods insists that none of her experiences were used for the completely fictional storyline, though she surmised that they could have happened. The partners with whom she had unsimulated sexual intercourse in the film included Robert Kerman and others drawn from the small group of veteran performers who appeared in most hardcore pornographic films made in the U.S. during that era. She also appeared in two sequels, &quot;Debbie Does Dallas Part II&quot; (1981) and &quot;Debbie Does Dallas III: The Final Chapter&quot; (1985).

Woods&#x27; adult-entertainment career occurred towards the end of the Golden Age of Porn, when the filmmakers operated in a legal gray area, making them vulnerable to extortion by organized criminals who controlled distribution. At the time, there were no laws requiring mandatory verification and record keeping of participants&#x27; true identities and ages, and the real names of even the most prolific actors remained unknown outside their profession until decades later, when the identities of almost all famous performers were circulated on the Internet. Despite the huge profits being made, female performers&#x27; fees rarely exceeded the low hundreds of dollars.

The film became a huge success, and Woods mixed with various celebrities in New York City clubs including Studio 54 and Plato&#x27;s Retreat. Woods disappeared completely from the public eye by the mid-1980s.

==Disappearance==
In 1986, Woods was reported missing. According to Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;, she died the same year of a drug overdose. However, in &quot;Debbie Does Dallas Uncovered&quot;, Clark said that a private investigator had learned Woods was living near Des Moines, Iowa and wished to avoid any further publicity.

<text>Fernand Edmond Jean Marie Khnopff (12 September 1858 – 12 November 1921) was a Belgian symbolist painter.

==Life==
===Youth and training===

Fernand Khnopff was born to a wealthy family that was part of the high bourgeoisie for generations. Khnopff&#x27;s ancestors had lived in the Vossenhoek area of Grembergen Flanders since the early 17th century but were of Austrian and Portuguese descent. Most male members of his family had been lawyers or judges, and young Fernand was destined for a juridical career. In his early childhood (1859–1864), he lived in Bruges where his father was appointed Substitut Du Procureur Du Roi. His childhood memories of the medieval city of Bruges would play a significant role in his later work. In 1864, the family moved to Brussels. In his childhood Khnopff spent part of his summer holidays in the hamlet of Tillet not so far from Bastogne in the Luxemburg province where his maternal grandparents owned an estate. He painted several views of this village.

To please his parents, he went to law school at the Free University of Brussels (now divided into the Université Libre de Bruxelles and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel) when he was 18 years old. During this period, he developed a passion for literature, discovering the works of Baudelaire, Flaubert, Leconte de Lisle and other mostly French authors. With his younger brother Georges Khnopff – also a passionate amateur of contemporary music and poetry – he started to frequent Jeune Belgique (&quot;Young Belgium&quot;), a group of young writers including Max Waller, Georges Rodenbach, Iwan Gilkin, and Emile Verhaeren.

Khnopff left University due to a lack of interest in his law studies and began to frequent the studio of Xavier Mellery, who made him familiar with the art of painting. On 25 October 1876, he enrolled for the Cours De Dessin Après Nature (&quot;course of drawing after nature&quot;) at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. At the Académie, his most famous fellow student was James Ensor, whom he disliked from the start. Between 1877 and 1880, Khnopff made several trips to Paris where he discovered the work of Delacroix, Ingres, Moreau and Stevens. At the Paris World Fair of 1878 he became acquainted with the oeuvre of Millais and Burne-Jones. During his last year at the Académie in 1878–1879 he neglected his classes in Brussels and lived for a while in Passy, where he visited the Cours Libres of Jules Joseph Lefebvre at the Académie Julian.

===Early career with Les XX===
In 1881, he presented his works to the public for the first time at the &quot;Salon de l&#x27;Essor&quot; in Brussels. The critics&#x27; appraisal of his work is very harsh, with the exception of Emile Verhaeren who wrote a commending review. Verhaeren would remain a lifelong supporter and would write the first monograph on the painter. In 1883, Khnopff was one of the founding members of the group Le Groupe des XX. Khnopff exhibited regularly at the annual &quot;Salon&quot; organised by Les XX.
In 1885, he met the French writer Joséphin Péladan the future grandmaster of the Rosicrucian &quot;Ordre de la Rose + Croix&quot;. Péladan asked Khnopff to design the cover for his new novel &quot;Le Vice suprême&quot;. Khnopff accepted this commission but destroyed the work later because the famous soprano Rose Caron was offended by the imaginary portrait of Leonora d&#x27;Este (a character in Péladan&#x27;s &quot;Le Vice suprême&quot;) that Khnopff had designed to adorn the cover and in which Caron thought to recognise her own face. The vehement reaction of &quot;La Caron&quot; on this occasion made a scandal in the Belgian and Parisian press and would help to establish Khnopff&#x27;s name as an artist. Khnopff continued to design illustrations for the works of Péladan, most notably for &quot;Femmes honnêtes&quot; (1888) and &quot;Le Panthée&quot; (1892). On several occasions (1892, 1893, 1894 and 1897) Khnopff was invited as guest of honour on the exhibitions of the Parisian &quot;Salon de la Rose + Croix&quot; organised by Péladan.

===Later years===
In 1889, Khnopff laid his first contacts with England, where he would stay and exhibit regularly in the future. British artists such as Hunt, Watts, Rossetti, Brown and Burne-Jones would become friends. From 1895 Khnopff worked as a correspondent for the British art journal &quot;The Studio&quot;. Until the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Khnopff would be responsible for the rubric &quot;Studio-Talks-Brussels&quot; in which he reported about the artistic evolutions in Belgium and continental Europe. In March 1898 Khnopff presented a selection of 21 works on the first exhibition of the Vienna Secession. In Vienna his work was received with massive admiration. The works he presented at the Secession would form a major influence on the oeuvre of Gustav Klimt.

From 1900 onwards, Khnopff was engaged in the design of his new home and studio in Brussels (demolished). The house was inspired by the Vienna Secession and more in particular by the architecture of Joseph Maria Olbrich. To the sober architecture and decoration Khnopff added a highly symbolic, spatial and decorative concept that turned his home into a &quot;Temple of the self&quot;. The house functioned as a shrine in which the genius of the painter could flourish. His motto &quot;On a que soi&quot; (One has but oneself) was inscribed above the entrance door, in and his studio he painted in the middle of golden circle inscribed on the white mosaic floor. This almost theatrical setting was undoubtedly a reflection of Khnopff&#x27;s passion for theatre and opera. Khnopff&#x27;s first designs for the theatre date from 1903 when he sketched the sets for a production of Georges Rodenbach&#x27;s play &quot;Le Mirage&quot; at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. This production was directed by the famous Max Reinhardt, and the sets evoking the gloomy streets of the mysterious city of Bruges where Khnopff had spent his early childhood, were much appreciated by the Berlin public and critics. After Khnopff had been engaged to design the costumes and the sets for the World premiere of Ernest Chausson&#x27;s opera Le Roi Arthus at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels in 1903, he collaborated on more than a dozen opera productions given at &quot;La Monnaie&quot; in the following decade. In 1904 the city council of Saint-Gilles commissioned him to decorate the ceilings of the &quot;Salle des Marriages&quot; (Wedding Room) of the new Municipal Hall, and in the same year he was approached by the wealthy banker Adolphe Stoclet to design decorative panels for the music room of the Stoclet Palace. Here Khnopff came in touch again with prominent artists from the Vienna Secession; the architect of the Stoclet Palace Josef Hoffmann, and Gustav Klimt who had designed a decorative mosaic for its dining room.

Although not a very open man and a rather secluded personality, he already achieved cult status during his life. Acknowledged and accepted, he received the Order of Leopold. His sister, Marguerite, was one of his favorite subjects. His most famous painting is probably &quot;Caress of the Sphinx&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Art ou Des Caresses&quot;). His art often portrayed a recurring theme found in symbolist art: the dualistic vision of woman as either &#x27;femme fatale&#x27; or angelic woman.

Khnopff is buried in Laeken Cemetery.

<text>A stacking window manager (also called floating window manager) is a window manager that draws and allows windows to overlap, without using a compositing algorithm. All window managers that allow the overlapping of windows but are not compositing window managers are considered stacking window managers, although it is possible that not all use exactly the same methods. Other window managers that are not considered stacking window managers are those that do not allow the overlapping of windows, which are called tiling window managers.

Stacking window managers allow windows to overlap using clipping to allow applications to write only to the visible parts of the windows they present.

The order in which windows are to be stacked is called their z-order.

== History ==

* 1970s: The Xerox Alto which contained the first working commercial GUI used a stacking window manager.
* Early 1980s: The Xerox Star, successor to the Alto, used tiling for most main application windows, and used overlapping only for dialogue windows removing the need for full stacking.
* The Classic Mac OS was one of the earliest commercially successful examples of a GUI which used stacking windows.
* GEM predated Microsoft Windows and used stacking, allowing all windows to overlap.
* Amiga OS contains an early example of a highly advanced stacking window manager.

== Microsoft Windows ==
Microsoft Windows 1.0 displayed windows using a tiling window manager. In Windows 2.0, it was replaced with a stacking window manager, which allowed windows to overlap. Microsoft kept the stacking window manager up through Windows XP, which presented severe limitations to its ability to display 3D-accelerated content inside normal windows. Although it was technically possible to produce some visual effects using third-party software. From Windows Vista onward, a new compositing window manager is the default on compatible systems.

==X Window System ==
Many windows managers under the X Window System provide stacking window functionality:
* 2bwm
* 4Dwm
* AfterStep
* amiwm
* awesome
* berry
* Blackbox
* ctwm
* cwm
* dwm
* qpwm
* eggwm
* Enlightenment
* Fluxbox
* FLWM
* FrankenWM
* FVWM
* FVWM95
* Goomwwm
* Hackedbox
* IceWM
* Iwm
* jbwm
* JWM
* Karmen
* KWin (with compositing turned off)
* MLVWM
* MWM
* Mutter
* Muffin
* olwm
* Openbox
* pawm
* PLWM
* Sawfish
* Scwm
* swm
* TinyWM
* tvtwm
* twm
* vwm
* vtwm
* Window Maker
* WindowLab
* wm2
* wmx
== Hybrid window managers ==
Some window managers may be able to treat the foreground window in an entirely different way, by rendering it indirectly, and sending its output to the video card to be added to the outgoing raster. While this technique may be possible to accomplish within some stacking window managers, it is technically compositing, with the foreground window and the screen raster being treated the same way two windows would be in a compositing window manager.

Interacting with objects outside the original area of the foreground window might also be impossible, since the window manager would not be able to determine what the user is seeing, and would pass such mouse clicks to whatever programs occupied those areas of the screen during the last stacking event.

<doc id="451936" wikidata="Q26235798" url="?curid=451936" title="Clapper rail">
<text>The clapper rail (Rallus crepitans) is a member of the rail family, Rallidae. The taxonomy for this species is confusing and still being determined. It is a large brown rail that is resident in wetlands along the Atlantic coasts of the eastern United States, eastern Mexico and some Caribbean islands. This species was formerly considered to be conspecific with the mangrove rail.
==Taxonomy==
The clapper rail was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other rails in the genus &quot;Rallus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Rallus crepitans&quot;. Gmelin based his description on those by Thomas Pennant and John Latham. The type locality is Long Island, New York. The genus &quot;Rallus&quot; had been erected in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;crepitans&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;breaking wind&quot; or &quot;resounding&quot;.

The clapper rail was formerly treated as a subspecies of the mangrove rail (&quot;Rallus longirostris&quot;). The decision to treat the clapper rail as a separate species was based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study that was published in 2013. A cladogram based on the 2013 genetic study is as follows:
Eight subspecies of the clapper rail are recognised:

* &quot;R. c. crepitans&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789 – coastal Connecticut to northeast North Carolina (USA)
* &quot;R. c. waynei&quot; Brewster, 1899 – coastal southeast USA
* &quot;R. c. saturatus&quot; Ridgway, 1880 – Gulf Coast from southwest Alabama to northeast Mexico
* &quot;R. c. scottii&quot; Sennett, 1888 – coastal Florida (USA)
* &quot;R. c. insularum&quot; Brooks, WS, 1920 – Florida Keys (USA)
* &quot;R. c. coryi&quot; Maynard, 1887 – Bahamas
* &quot;R. c. caribaeus&quot; Ridgway, 1880 – Cuba to Puerto Rico, Lesser Antilles to Antigua and Guadeloupe
* &quot;R. c. pallidus&quot; Nelson, 1905 – north Yucatán Peninsula, islands off Quintana Roo (southeast Mexico), Ycacos Lagoon (Belize)

==Description==
The clapper rail is a chicken-sized bird that rarely flies. It is grayish brown with a pale chestnut breast. Males and females have similar plumage. The bill which curves slightly downwards is orange yellow at the base in males and duller in females. An adult bird has an overall length of and weighs .

==Distribution and habitat==
The clapper rail is found along the Atlantic coasts of the eastern U.S., the Gulf of Mexico, eastern Mexico, some Caribbean islands, and south through eastern Central America, as well at several inland locales. Populations are stable on the East Coast of the U.S., although the numbers of this bird have declined due to habitat loss. Clapper rails are saltmarsh specialists, and are highly mobile across their range, with females showing weak philopatry and a lack of philopatry in males.
==Behaviour==
===Feeding===
These birds eat crustaceans, aquatic insects, and small fish. They search for food while walking, sometimes probing with their long bills, in shallow water or mud.

===Breeding===
The nest is a large platform of dry grasses and is usually placed on the ground in dense vegetation. The clutch size varies between four and sixteen eggs with an average of nine. The eggs measure and are creamy white with irregular blotches of reddish-brown, grey or lilac. They are incubated for 20 days by both parents with the male incubating at night. The young are brooded by the adults for several days. They become independent of the adults when six weeks old and can fly when 10 weeks old.

<doc id="451946" wikidata="Q570100" url="?curid=451946" title="Hitler's Obersalzberg Speech">
<text>The Obersalzberg Speech is a speech which Adolf Hitler delivered in the presence of &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; commanders at his Obersalzberg home on 22 August 1939, a week before the German invasion of Poland.

==Origin of the &quot;Lochner&quot; version of the Obersalzberg speech==
In August 1939, American journalist Louis P. Lochner contacted American diplomat Alexander Comstock Kirk and showed him the text, but Kirk was not interested. Lochner next contacted British diplomat George Ogilvie-Forbes, who indeed transmitted it back to London on 25 August 1939. Canadian historian Michael Marrus wrote that Lochner almost certainly obtained the text from Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; (German intelligence), who was present at the Obersalzberg Conference.

Three documents were grouped together during the Nuremberg trials that contained Hitler&#x27;s speech on 22 August 1939 (1014-PS, 798-PS, and L-3,) and only document L-3 contained a reference to the Armenian genocide. Documents 1014-PS and 798-PS were seized by U.S. forces inside the headquarters of the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) but the documents did not contain the Armenian quote. On 16 May 1946, during the Nuremberg trials, counsel for one of the defendants, Dr. Walter Siemers, requested that the court strike document 1014-PS, but his request was rejected. Document L-3 was brought to the court by Lochner.

According to Lochner, while he was stationed in Berlin, he received a copy of a speech by Hitler from his informant. Lochner later published the speech (in English translation) in his book &quot;What About Germany?&quot; (New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., 1942) as being indicative of Hitler&#x27;s desire to conquer the world. In 1945, Lochner handed over to the Nuremberg prosecution a transcript of the German document he had received, and it was labeled &quot;L-3&quot;. Hence it is known as the &quot;L-3 document&quot;. The speech is also found in a footnote to notes about a speech that Hitler held in Obersalzberg on 22 August 1939 and was published in the German foreign policy documents When later asked at Nuremberg who his source was, Lochner said it was a German named &quot;Herr Maasz&quot; but gave vague information about him.

&quot;The Times&quot; quoted from Lochner&#x27;s version in an unattributed article titled &quot;The War Route of the Nazi Germany&quot; on 24 November 1945. The article stated that the document had been brought forward by the prosecutor on 23 November 1945 as evidence. However, according to the &quot;Akten zur deutschen auswärtigen Politik&quot; (ser. D, vol. 7, 1961), the document was not introduced as evidence before the International Military Tribunal for undisclosed reasons, and is not included in the official publication of the documents in evidence. Two other documents containing minutes of Hitler&#x27;s Obersalzberg speech(es) had been found among the seized German documents and were introduced as evidence, both omitting the Armenian quote.

In &quot;Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression&quot; (colloquially known as &quot;the Red Set&quot;), a collection of documents related to the Nuremberg trials which was compiled by the prosecutorial team, the editors describe the relationship between the relevant documents as follows:

In his book &quot;What about Germany?&quot;, Lochner offered the following English translation of the third paragraph of the document &quot;L-3&quot;:

<doc id="451948" wikidata="Q1622688" url="?curid=451948" title="Hodge (cat)">
<text>Hodge (fl. c.1769) was one of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s cats, immortalised in a characteristically whimsical passage in James Boswell&#x27;s 1791 book &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;.

Although there is little known about Hodge, such as his life, his death, or any other information, what is known is Johnson&#x27;s fondness for his cat, which separated Johnson from the views held by others of the eighteenth century.

==Life==
Most of the information on Hodge comes from Boswell&#x27;s account. It is in this passage that Johnson is claimed to have an affection for animals:
The latter anecdote is used as the epigraph to Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s acclaimed poem/novel &quot;Pale Fire&quot;.

Johnson bought oysters for his cat. In modern England, oysters are an expensive food for the well-to-do, but in the 18th century oysters were plentiful around the coasts of England and so cheap that they were a staple food of the poor. Johnson refused to send Francis Barber to buy Hodge&#x27;s food, fearing that it would be seen as degrading to his servant, so he would personally buy the food for Hodge.

Boswell also noted how Johnson went out to purchase valerian to ease Hodge&#x27;s suffering as death approached. Although Hodge was not Johnson&#x27;s only cat, it was Hodge whom he considered his favourite. Hodge was remembered in various forms, from biographical mentions during Johnson&#x27;s life to poems written about the cat. On his death, Hodge&#x27;s life was celebrated in &quot;An Elegy on The Death of Dr Johnson&#x27;s Favourite Cat&quot; by Percival Stockdale (published 1778). In this poem the phrase &quot;sable fur&quot; indicates that Hodge was a black cat; also, the fact that Stockdale was Johnson&#x27;s neighbour from 1769 onwards suggests that Hodge was alive at that time: &quot;Who, by his master when caressed, warmly his gratitude expressed, and never failed his thanks to purr, whene&#x27;er he stroked his sable furr [sic]&quot;.

==&quot;Hodge&quot; statue==

Today Hodge is remembered by a bronze statue, unveiled in 1997 by Sir Roger Cook, the then-Lord Mayor of London, outside the house in Gough Square he shared with Johnson and Barber, Johnson&#x27;s black manservant and heir. The statue shows Hodge sitting next to a pair of empty oyster shells atop a copy of Johnson&#x27;s famous dictionary, with the inscription &quot;a very fine cat indeed&quot;. It has become customary for visitors that walk past the statue to place coins in the oyster shells as tokens of good luck. To mark special occasions and anniversaries a pink piece of counsel&#x27;s ribbon may be seen tied to one of the oyster shells or around Hodge&#x27;s neck.

Sculptor Jon Bickley perceived a kinship with Johnson, noting, &quot;It seems Dr. Johnson and I were meant to come together . . . He was born in Lichfield, in the Midlands, and I was brought up just outside it. I can close my eyes and picture his birth house.&quot; Bickley modelled the cat on his own pet, Thomas Henry, and carefully selected the sculpture&#x27;s height for maximum accessibility: &quot;I made Hodge about shoulder height for the average adult, which is just about right for putting an arm around.&quot;

==Popular culture==
The cat Hodge—along with Dr. Johnson&#x27;s second favourite cat, Lily—are the subjects of a book by Yvonne Skargon (Johnson is also given authorial credit) entitled &quot;Lily and Hodge and Dr. Johnson&quot;. The book consists of quotations from Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot;, accompanied by Skargon&#x27;s wood engravings of the two cats, contextually associated with the dictionary entries. Susan Coolidge&#x27;s ode &quot;Hodge, the Cat&quot; celebrates Samuel Johnson&#x27;s affection for Hodge; it appears in a collection of feline-focused poems and anecdotes published in 1912, and edited by Agnes Repplier. Hodge also appears in Charlie Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;Silvertongue&quot; as a brave and fearless cat. Hodge also appears in Samuel Beckett&#x27;s early dramatic fragment &quot;Human Wishes&quot;. In M. C. Beaton&#x27;s &quot;Agatha Raisin&quot; novel series, the heroine&#x27;s cats are named Hodge and Boswell. The English critic, essayist and poet Leigh Hunt wrote an essay entitled &quot;The Cat by the Fire&quot; which features an imaginary description of how some of Samuel Johnson&#x27;s friends and acquaintances would have related to Hodge the cat. In December 2020, Southwark Cathedral named its newly-adopted cat Hodge, as Gough Square is nearby, and Johnson is depicted in one of the cathedral&#x27;s stained glass windows.

<doc id="451950" wikidata="Q1620818" url="?curid=451950" title="Historiometry">
<text>Historiometry is the historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics, using statistics to analyze references to geniuses, their statements, behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts. Historiometry combines techniques from cliometrics, which studies economic history and from psychometrics, the psychological study of an individual&#x27;s personality and abilities.

==Origins==
Historiometry started in the early 19th century with studies on the relationship between age and achievement by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the careers of prominent French and English playwrights but it was Sir Francis Galton, an English polymath who popularized historiometry in his 1869 work, &quot;Hereditary Genius&quot;. It was further developed by Frederick Adams Woods (who coined the term &quot;historiometry&quot;) in the beginning of the 20th century. Also psychologist Paul E. Meehl published several papers on historiometry later in his career, mainly in the area of medical history, although it is usually referred to as &quot;cliometric metatheory&quot; by him.

Historiometry was the first field studying genius by using scientific methods.

==Current research==
Prominent current historiometry researchers include Dean Keith Simonton and Charles Murray.

Historiometry is defined by Dean Keith Simonton as: a quantitative method of statistical analysis for retrospective data. In Simonton&#x27;s work the raw data comes from psychometric assessment of famous personalities, often already deceased, in an attempt to assess creativity, genius and talent development.

Charles Murray&#x27;s &quot;Human Accomplishment&quot; is one example of this approach to quantify the impact of individuals on technology, science and the arts. This work tracks many famous innovators in these areas, and quantifies how much attention to them has been paid by past historians, in terms of the number of references and the number of pages of reference material devoted to each subject. However, this work has been criticized for manipulating its data to derive conclusions that would not follow from unmanipulated data.

==Examples of research==
Since historiometry deals with subjective personal traits as creativity, charisma or openness most studies deal with the comparison of scientists, artists or politicians. The study (&quot;Human Accomplishment&quot;) by Charles Murray classifies, for example, Einstein and Newton as the most important physicists and Michelangelo as the top ranking western artist. As another example, several studies have compared charisma and even the IQ of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States. The latter study classifies John Quincy Adams as the most clever US president, with an estimated IQ between 165 and 175.
A historiometric analysis has also been applied successfully in the field of musicology. In one groundbreaking study, researchers analyzed statistically a collection of over 1,300 printed program leaflets (playbills) of concerts given by Clara Schumann (1819–1896) throughout her lifetime. The resulting analysis revealed Clara Schumann&#x27;s influential role in the canonization of classical piano music repertoire. Her strategy of repertoire selection was guided by extremely traditionalistic tendencies.

==Critique==
Since historiometry is based on indirect information like historic documents and relies heavily on statistics, the results of these studies are questioned by some researchers, mainly because of concerns about &quot;over-interpretation&quot; of the estimated results.

The previously mentioned study of the intellectual capacity of US presidents, a study by &quot; Dean Keith Simonton&quot;, attracted a lot of media attention and critique mainly because it classified the former US president, George W. Bush, as second to last of all US presidents since 1900. The IQ of G.W. Bush was estimated as between 111.1 and 138.5, with an average of 125, exceeding only that of president Warren Harding, who is regarded as a failed president, with an average IQ of 124. Although controversial and imprecise (due to gaps in available data), the approach used by Simonton to generate his results was regarded &quot;reasonable&quot; by fellow researchers.
In the media, the study was sometimes compared with the &quot;U.S. Presidents IQ hoax&quot;, a hoax that circulated via email in mid-2001, which suggested that G.W. Bush had the lowest IQ of all US presidents.

<doc id="451952" wikidata="Q494074" url="?curid=451952" title="Gongmin of Goryeo">
<text>Gongmin (; 23 May 1330 – 27 October 1374), also known by his Mongolian name, Bayan Temür, was 31st ruler of Goryeo from 1351 to 1374. He was the second son of King Chungsuk.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Goryeo had been a semi-autonomous vassal state under the overlordship of the Mongol Yuan dynasty since the Mongol invasions of Korea in the 13th century. Starting with King Chungnyeol, prospective rulers of Korea married Mongolian princesses and were customarily sent to the Yuan Court, in effect, as hostages. As per this custom, King Gongmin spent many years in the Yuan court, being sent there in 1341, before ascending the Korean throne. He married a Mongolian princess who became Queen Indeok. The Yuan dynasty began to crumble during the mid-14th century, and was eventually conquered and replaced by the Ming dynasty in 1368.

===Reign===
With the disintegration of Yuan, which had forcibly allied the Korean peninsula since the 40 year long Mongol invasion of Korea of 1238, King Gongmin began efforts to reform Goryeo government. His first act was to remove all pro-Mongol aristocrats and military officers from their positions. These deposed people formed a dissident faction which plotted an unsuccessful coup against the king. High official Cho Il-sin even tried to take over the government, but this rebellion was put down by general Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng.

During the Mongol invasions of Korea, between the 1250s and the 1270s, the Mongols annexed the northern provinces of Korea and incorporated them into their empire as Ssangseong and Dongnyeong Prefectures. In 1356, the Goryeo army retook these provinces partly thanks to the defection of Yi Cha-ch&#x27;un, a minor Korean official in the service of the Mongols in Ssangseong, and his son, Yi Sŏng-gye. In addition, Generals Yi Sŏng-gye and Chi Yong-su led a campaign into Liaoyang.

Another issue was the question of land holdings. The land-grant system had broken down, and Mongol-favoured officials, along with a handful of landed gentry, owned the vast majority of agricultural landholdings, which were worked by tenant farmers and bondsmen. However, King Gongmin&#x27;s attempt at land reform was met with opposition and subterfuge from officials who were supposed to implement his reforms, as they were landowners themselves.

The Wokou (Japanese pirates) were also a problem during King Gongmin&#x27;s reign. Initially starting as &#x27;hit-and-run&#x27; bandits, the Wokou evolved into well-organized military marauders raiding deep into the interior. Generals Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng and Yi Sŏng-gye were tasked to combat them.

Additionally, King Gongmin grappled with the Red Turban troops, who invaded Goryeo twice during his reign (first in 1359 and again in 1361). In 1361, the Red Turban troops occupied Kaesong for a short period of time. After Kaesong was recaptured by Generals Ch&#x27;oe Yŏng, Yi Sŏng-gye, Chŏng Se-un, and Yi Pang-sil, few Red Turban troops escaped with their lives.
During the reign of King Gongmin, a Goryeo diplomat, Mun Ik-jeom, stationed in China, managed to smuggle cotton seeds into Goryeo, introducing cotton cultivation to the Korean peninsula.

Although the relationship between Princess Noguk and the king was very close, they failed to conceive an heir for many years. Despite suggestions of taking a second wife, King Gongmin ignored these requests. The king was also known to have entered into pederastic relationships with several court catamites, or &quot;chajewi&quot;, and the names of five of these are recorded as: Hong Yun, Han An, Kwon Chin, Hong Kwan, and No Son. Princess Noguk became pregnant but died from complications with childbirth in 1365. Her death led to King Gongmin&#x27;s depression and mental instability. King Gongmin became indifferent to politics and entrusted the great tasks of state to Pyeonjo, a Buddhist monk who was born as the son of a princess and a slave. Judging him as clever, King Gongmin renamed Pyeonjo as Sin Ton. Having the full confidence of King Gongmin, Sin Ton tried to reform the society of Goryeo. In 1365, King Gongmin gave Pyeonjo the nickname &quot;Cheonghan Geosa&quot; and the noble title of &quot;Jinpyeonghu&quot; (&quot;Chinpyŏng Marquess&quot;). After six years, Sin Ton lost his position, and King Gongmin had him executed in 1371. During his visits, the king had grown close to one of Sin Ton&#x27;s servants, Banya, with whom he had a son named Monino in 1365. After Sin Ton&#x27;s death, the boy was proclaimed heir apparent and it was claimed that his mother was a deceased palace maid.

Goryeo&#x27;s entrenched bureaucracy never forgave King Gongmin for his reform efforts. They interpreted his policy of cutting all ties with the Yuan and establishing relations with Ming China as a direct threat to their status and feared that further attempts at reform might follow. Kaesong&#x27;s deposed pro-Mongol faction battled to protect its position and hoped to renew ties with the Mongols.

===Death===
The details of King Gongmin&#x27;s reign and the circumstances surrounding his death are recorded in &quot;Goryeosa&quot;, the history of the Joseon period. The account of his murder may have been colored by the fact that the &quot;Goryeosa&quot; was intended to legitimize the succeeding dynasty by demonstrating the moral failures of the previous one, but there is no alternative historical record to counter the &quot;Goryeosa&quot; account. According to an entry for the first day of the tenth lunar month in the twenty-first year of the reign of King Gongmin - in the forty-third volume of &quot;Goryeosa&quot;, the sixth Book of King Gongmin — in 1372 King Gongmin formed an elite group of young men called the &quot;Jajewi&quot; (&#x27;Noble Youth Guards&#x27;), selected from among the most promising sons of the nobility. Ostensibly, the &quot;Jajewi&quot; was organized so that Gongmin himself could instruct these young men and groom them as the next generation of loyal government ministers. However, the record goes on to recount that Gongmin had become mentally unbalanced after the death of his first wife, and though he had four consorts, he rarely visited them and was impotent. The members of &quot;Jajewi&quot; were selected, not for their virtues, but for their youthful beauty and perverted dispositions, to become the King&#x27;s intimate companions.

The record goes on to say that the King ordered the men of the &quot;Jajewi&quot; to have relations with his consorts, in order to produce a male child that he could claim as his own. When three of the consorts, Jung, Hye, and Sin refused and threatened to commit suicide if they were violated, the King personally took several of the &quot;Jajewi&quot; men, including Hong Ryun () and Han An (), to the chamber of Consort Ik and frightened her into complying by threatening her with his sword. After this, the men often went to her chamber at night under the pretext of fulfilling the King&#x27;s order.

It is written in the &quot;Life of Hong Ryon&quot; (Hong Ryun) that two years later, on the night of the murder, the eunuch Ch&#x27;oe Man-saeng () reported to King Gongmin that Consort Ik was in her fifth month of pregnancy. The King was greatly pleased by this, and asked who the father was. When he learned that it was Hong Ryun (), he told the eunuch that he would now have to kill him and the entire group of &quot;Jajewi&quot; men in order to keep the secret of her baby&#x27;s paternity.

That same night, on the twenty-first day of the ninth lunar month in the twenty-third year of the reign of King Gongmin (1374 C.E.), at the royal palace in Songdo, the capital of the Kingdom of Goryeo, several men entered the King&#x27;s private chamber in the middle of the night and butchered him with swords. Though at least three people shouted, &quot;enemy has entered,&quot; the palace guards dared not make a move, and the royal servants refused to come out of their rooms. Immediately after the murder, a court eunuch named Yi Kang-tal and the high ministers Gyung Bouheung, Yi In-im, and An Sagi, conducted an inquiry, discovered Ch&#x27;oe Man-saeng still wearing clothes stained with Gongmin&#x27;s blood, and extracted a confession from him. He named five members of the elite &quot;Jajewi&quot;, including Hong Ryun, as his accomplices. All six were executed, their fathers put in prison, their children hanged, their families&#x27; properties confiscated, and their brothers and uncles flogged and sent into exile. Mercy was shown only to the wives, who were allowed to live on as palace slaves.

After his death, a high official Yi In-im assumed the helm of the government and enthroned eleven-year-old, King U.

<doc id="451956" wikidata="Q752770" url="?curid=451956" title="Coat of arms of Anguilla">
<text>The coat of arms of Anguilla is the heraldic device consisting of a shield charged with three orange dolphins leaping over the sea. Adopted in 1990, it has been the coat of arms of Anguilla since that year. The escutcheon is featured on the flag of the territory.

==History==
Anguilla became a colony of the Kingdom of England in 1650, when settlers from Saint Kitts moved to the island. A legislative union between the two islands was later established in 1825, despite vehement opposition from Anguillan freeholders over the arrangement of having Saint Kitts pass laws for both areas. Anguillans appealed to the British government in 1872 calling for an end to the union and direct rule, but this was disregarded. A decade later, a federal act resulted in the amalgamation of Saint Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla under the British Leeward Islands federation.
In 1956 the Leeward Islands federation was dissolved. Two years later a unitary political entity called the West Indies Federation was created; Saint Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla joined the federation upon its creation. This new federation dissolved in 1962, but five years later the three islands became an Associated State. However, this was once more against the will of the Anguillan people. They consequently expelled the Saint Kitts police, seceded from the union, and declared the Republic of Anguilla. During this time, a flag with three orange dolphins and a blue stripe at the bottom (dubbed the Three Dolphins flag) was unofficially adopted as the banner of the unrecognised state. British rule was soon restored and the Anguilla Act 1971 placed the island under direct rule from London. Nine years later, Anguilla was accorded its own constitution and its union with Saint Kitts and Nevis officially ended.

The territory&#x27;s constitution was amended in 1990, and a new flag was first raised on 30 May that year. It consisted of Blue Ensign with a shield that incorporated the design of the Three Dolphins flag. Later that same year, on 27 November, a Royal Warrant was issued granting Anguilla its own shield. In the run-up to the fiftieth anniversary of the Anguillian Revolution in 2017, a proposal was drawn up to augment the coat of arms with a crest and two supporters, along with the territory&#x27;s motto. The design was submitted for approval in March of that year, with the College of Arms overseeing its technical aspects. A crest and supporters were formally granted by Elizabeth II on 30 January 2020.

==Design==
===Official description===
The official blazon granted by the British College of Arms is as follows: &quot;Argent in base the Sea of Turquoise hue in chief three natural Dolphins embowed and leaping in a circle each tinctured Orange-Gold the Shield garnished of Gold&quot;.

The official description also includes a crest and supporters which are currently unused. The crest is &quot;An Eel (Anguilla Anguilla) haurient proper crowned with an Ancient Crown Or&quot;, while the supporters are &quot;Dexter An Anguillan Fisherman proper wearing trousers rolled up to the knee Azure with a cloth waistband Or holding with his dexter hand a Strap Sable suspended therefrom by the mouth two pot fish namely a Jack Fish and a Red Snapper proper Sinister An Anguillan Woman vested in an ankle and wrist length Robe and Head Wrap Azure thereover an Apron Argent the lower hem and tied round the waist with an Orange-Gold band holding by the Stalk a Maize Plant leaved Vert fructed proper&quot;.

===Symbolism===
The colours and objects on the coat of arms carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The white background epitomises peace and tranquility. The blue at the bottom evokes the surrounding Caribbean Sea, as well as faith, youth and hope. The three dolphins symbolise unity, strength and endurance. This is also the motto of the territory. The circle they are arranged in represents continuity.

===Uses===
The shield from the arms features on the flag of Anguilla and on the standard of the territory&#x27;s governor.

<text>St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Walthamstow, is a Church of England parish church in Walthamstow Village, a conservation area in Walthamstow, east London. It was founded in the 12th century and is still a working church with a cafe, Play Area and Exhibition Space open during the week. St Mary&#x27;s also hires rooms and spaces in both the church and nearby St Mary&#x27;s Welcome Centre to outside groups. It retains over one hundred and fifty brasses and monuments, the oldest dating from 1436, though all that now remains of the original Norman church is some pillar bases and the chisel marks on them. In 2021-2022, the church was extensively renovated with support from the National Lottery and now includes a modern extension which contains the Parish Office and an Exhibition Space. 

==History==
The first church building on the site was constructed in the 12th century, and measured about 15 metres by 8 metres (46 feet by 24 feet) with a sanctuary or chancel of unknown size at the east end. It was probably built of flint rubble and stood where the present nave now stands.

It is believed that the north aisle of the church was rebuilt in the 13th century and the south aisle in the 14th century, both extending east only as far as the current chancel arch. In the 15th century a tower was added at the west end and the chancel was also extended eastward.

In 1535, Sir George Monoux, Alderman of London and Master of the Worshipful Company of Drapers, one of the guilds of the City of London, repaired the north aisle and built a chapel on the east end of it running along the north wall of the chancel. At the same time, Monoux demolished the top of the tower and rebuilt it in Tudor brick, adding a spiral stairway in a turret at the south-east corner of the tower. In the same year, money from Robert Thorne (a wealthy London merchant who, like Monoux, originated from Bristol and became Lord Mayor of the City of London) was used to completely rebuild the south aisle and to add a chapel on its eastern end.

Internal galleries to provide extra seating for the congregation were added in the 18th century, the first being constructed at the west end of the church in 1710, with further galleries being built in the north and south aisles during the course of the century. In 1819, the aisle galleries were linked with the western one, and the walls of the nave at the west end were increased in height. At the same time, the old windows of the nave were bricked up and the present Gothic revival ones cut. In 1843, the rest of the walls of the church were increased in height to match that of the west end, and the pillars of the nave were heightened and remodelled to their present shape, leaving only the column bases as the final remnant of the 12th-century church above ground level. A rose window was also inserted in the east wall of the chancel. The new parish of St Peter&#x27;s was split off from the parish in 1845.

In 1876, the galleries were &#x27;thrown back&#x27; from the nave pillars (i.e. reduced in width by one half), an older plaster ceiling was removed and a roof of stained wood installed. The private box pews which had accrued in the nave since the Reformation were also removed and replaced by open benches which were, in turn, superseded by the current pews in the 1920s, together with oak panelling to the rear and sides of the church and in the galleries as a First World War memorial. Choir stalls of carved oak were given to the church by Sir William Mallinson in 1939 in memory of his father.

In 1936 the east wall was found to be suffering from structural failure and, during the course of repairs, the opportunity was taken to rebuild that part of the church and extend the chancel 3 metres (12 feet) east and to build vestries on either side. In 1939, a large window in perpendicular gothic style was added to the east end of the church.

St Mary&#x27;s suffered serious damage during Second World War. On 4 October 1940 the south aisle roof was destroyed by incendiary bomb and the gallery on that side was subsequently demolished to provide timber for repairing the church. On 8 October 1944, a bomb damaged the north side of the church tower. It was reported that a bomb disposal officer who investigated the scene in the dark could &quot;feel the shape of a bomb and the jagged edge of its fins.&quot; The churchyard was closed for two Sundays pending investigations. It transpired that the &quot;bomb&quot; was an old lead coffin, broken open by debris failing from the tower.

During the spring of 1942 all the railings surrounding the churchyard and most of those round the monuments were removed to provide scrap iron help the war effort. All that remained were the north and south gates.

Post-war restoration of the church included a new heating system (with a boiler house built outside the north porch) and the rebuilding of the organ. The railings outside were replaced in 1955. In the early 1960s the east end of the south aisle was remodelled to create a side chapel.

Between 1995 and 2001, extensive refurbishment of the church took place, which included removing three rows of pews from the west end of the nave, reflooring and creating a larger entrance area adjacent to the west door. When the floor was removed some of the crypt underneath the church were rediscovered. During the same work, when the ceiling from the entrance lobby underneath the bell tower was removed, it revealed several large oak beams probably used during the reconstruction of the tower in the 16th century. It was decided that these beams would be refurbished and left permanently exposed; the 18th century beams of the south porch roof were similarly restored and left exposed. At the same period a disabled toilet and refreshment area were installed and the sanctuary was reordered.

In 2001, the floor of the chancel was lowered and extended into the nave to provide an open space for worship. Two of the choir stalls were retained in the sanctuary and the rest relocated to the west end of the gallery. Communion can now be celebrated at the front of the nave and served on three sides.

In 2016, a major project was launched to restore the 10 church bells so that they are able to be rung for at least another 100 years and future generations can enjoy them. The last major work that was done on the bells was in 1896 when 3 new bells were added. In Feb 2016, new hatches were cut into the ceiling of the ringing room and clock chamber (between ringing room and bells) and this allowed the bells and their fittings to be removed and taken to John Taylor&#x27;s Bell Foundry in Loughborough for specialist work, including cleaning and re-tuning. New fittings were made for the bells and they returned in Sept 2016. When the bells returned, they were hoisted up the tower and into the bell chamber, where they were re-hung in their 1896 cast iron frame which had been re-painted. New sound control shutters were fitted behind the louvres in the bell chamber, so that they can be shut when the bells are being rung for long periods of time, usually called a &#x27;peal&#x27; and lasting for roughly 3 hours.

The bells are rung regularly today and thanks to the restoration work, can do so for many years to come.

In 2019, St Mary&#x27;s announced it had secured a nearly £1.5 million National Lottery Fund Heritage grant to restore and renovate the church building as part of its Creative Church project. The works began in 2021 and cost approximately £3.37 million in total. The regeneration project repaired and renovated the ancient building to make it more suitable for community arts and cultural activities, alongside securing its future as a working parish church. The project removed the pews to create more flexible seating, built an extension to create a new entrance and gallery space, created a cafe with an outdoor serving window, upgraded the sound system and lighting, added additional toilets, created heritage displays and renovated the church&#x27;s two back vestries among other improvements. Free community arts and heritage activities were also part of the project.

==Churchyard==
The churchyard contains war graves of three service personnel of World War I and nine of World War II.

The churchyard is home to the Burials in Bloom project, where local residents &quot;adopt&quot; a grave that is not currently visited. Dozens of residents have participated in the community gardening scheme, which is run by head gardener Tim Hewitt. In 2021, St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard won London in Bloom&#x27;s &quot;Silver Gilt&quot; award for the churchyard category.

==St. Mary&#x27;s today==
St Mary&#x27;s is an active church today, with a large congregation involved in supporting the local community.

The church hosts regular exhibitions, performances and other community events, and has a cafe run by local partners Ruttle &amp; Rowe with both indoor and outdoor seating as well as a Play Area for young children. St Mary&#x27;s is a founding member of Waltham Forest Citizens, the local Citizens UK alliance. St Mary&#x27;s is also a member of the Inclusive Church network. In addition to being known for its ancient building and community involvement, St Mary&#x27;s is also well known for its churchyard, which is the largest green space in Walthamstow Village and which won &#x27;Churchyard of the Year&#x27; in the 2023 London in Bloom gardening competition.

<doc id="451962" wikidata="Q233954" url="?curid=451962" title="Coat of arms of Antigua and Barbuda">
<text>The coat of arms of Antigua and Barbuda was designed in 1966 by Gordon Christopher. It was officially introduced on 16 February 1967. The symbolism of the arms is more complex than that found on the flag of Antigua and Barbuda, but many elements are similar.

At the top of the coat of arms is a pineapple, a fruit for which the islands are famous. There are several plants found around the shield, all abundant in the country: red hibiscus, sugarcane, and century plant (&quot;Agave americana&quot;). Supporting the shield is a pair of deer representing the wildlife of the islands.

The design on the shield shows the sun, also found on the flag, rising from a blue and white sea. The sun symbolises a new beginning, and the black background represents the African origins of many of the nation&#x27;s citizens. At the bottom of the shield, in front of the sea, sits a stylised sugar mill. The sun on the shield represents the six parishes of Antigua, and, the island of Barbuda.

At the bottom is a scroll upon which is written the national motto: &quot;Each endeavouring, all achieving&quot;.

<text>In engineering, defect tracking is the process of tracking the logged defects in a product from beginning to closure (by inspection, testing, or recording feedback from customers), and making new versions of the product that fix the defects. Defect tracking is important in software engineering as complex software systems typically have tens, hundreds, or thousands of defects; therefore, managing, evaluating and prioritizing these defects is a difficult task. When the number of defects gets quite large, and the defects need to be tracked over extended periods of time, use of a defect tracking system can make the management task much easier.

<doc id="451969" wikidata="Q17204886" url="?curid=451969" title="List of protected natural resources in Serbia">
<text>Protected areas cover around 5% of the territory of Serbia. The &quot;Law on the Protection of the Nature&quot; defines these categories of protected areas:
* Strict nature reserve — Area of unmodified natural features with representative ecosystems set aside for the preservation of its biodiversity and for scientific research and monitoring.
* Special nature reserve — Area of unmodified or slightly modified natural features of great importance due to uniqueness and rarity which includes the habitats of endangered species set aside for the preservation of its unique features, education, limited tourism and for scientific research and monitoring.
* National park — Area with large number of diverse ecosystems of national value, with outstanding natural features and/or cultural heritage set aside for the preservation of its natural resources and for educational, scientific and tourist use.
* Natural monument — Small unmodified or slightly modified natural feature, object or phenomenon, easily detectable and unique, with unique natural attributes.
* Protected habitat — Area which includes habitats of one or more wildlife species.
* Landscape of outstanding features — Area of remarkable appearance with important natural and cultural value.
* Nature park — Area of well-preserved natural values with preserved natural ecosystems and picturesque landscape set aside for the preservation of biodiversity and for educational, tourist, recreational and scientific use.

==National parks==

There are 5 national parks in Serbia (IUCN Category II) as of 2007, and one more which is proposed and is in the procedure of receiving the status of the National Park: One of those National parks (Šar Mountain) is located on the territory of Kosovo. Although Kosovo declared independence in 2008, Serbian government does not recognize this, so Šar Mountain is still listed as a Serbian National park by Serbian authorities.

==Nature reserves==
There are 22 nature reserves (IUCN category Ia) in Serbia and 6 more which are in the procedure of receiving the status of a Nature reserve. They are grouped into two groups: &quot;Strict Nature Reserves&quot; and &quot;Special Nature Reserves&quot;:

==Nature Parks and Landscapes of Outstanding Features==
There are 23 Nature parks and Landscapes of Outstanding Features (IUCN Category Ib) and 8 more which are in the procedure of receiving the status of a Nature park or a Landscape of outstanding features:

==Natural monuments==
There are currently 64 natural monuments of geological heritage and 225 monuments of botanical heritage (mostly rare trees) in Serbia. Some of the best known monuments of geological heritage are: Resavska cave, Đavolja Varoš, Marble cave and Rugova Canyon.

<text>The coat of arms of the Argentine Republic or Argentine shield () was established in its current form in 1944 but has its origins in the seal of the General Constituent Assembly of 1813. It is supposed that it was chosen quickly because of the existence of a decree signed on February 22 sealed with the symbol. The first mention of it in a public document dates to March 12 of that same year, in which it is stated that the seal had to be used by the executive power, that is, the second triumvirate. On April 13 the National Assembly coined the new silver and gold coins, each with the seal of the assembly on the reverse, and on April 27 the coat of arms became a national emblem. Although the coat of arms is not currently shown on flags, the Buenos Aires-born military leader Manuel Belgrano ordered to paint it over the flag he gave to the city of San Salvador de Jujuy, and during the Argentine War of Independence most flags had the coat of arms.

==Description==
It is unknown who designed the coat of arms. It is often mentioned that there were three men involved: Alvear, Monteagudo, and Vieytes, but it is known that a few years before, President Bernardino Rivadavia asked the Peruvian Antonio Isidoro Castro to create an Argentine coat of arms; these two schemes have never been found.

The coat of arms is a figure, in which at the top we find the gold-yellowed Sun of May, also found on the flag of Argentina. The rising sun symbolizes the rising of Argentina, as described in the first version of the Argentine National Anthem, &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;a new and glorious nation rises to the surface of the Earth&quot;. It must be noticed how the verb &quot;rise&quot;, in English and Spanish can be used to describe the motion of the Sun.

In the center ellipse there are two shaking hands, connoting the unity of the provinces of Argentina. The hands come together to hold a pike, which represents power and willingness to defend freedom, epitomized by the Phrygian cap on the top of the spear.
The blue and white colors are symbols of the Argentine people and the same colors of the Argentine flag. Those derive from those utilised in the cockade promoting liberation from Spain, in the May Revolution in 1810, which in turn came about from the colours of the Borbonic dynasty.

The hands stand for friendship, peace, unity, and brotherhood. The pike is brown (wooden), and the Phrygian cap is red, like the traditional French Revolution era liberty cap. The proximity of the hands and the Phrygian cap, in addition to their individual meanings, represent the national motto of Argentina, &quot;&quot; (&quot;in unity and freedom&quot;), and illustrate the idea that in unity (the hands) there is power (the pike), and in power there is freedom (the Phrygian cap).

The Phrygian cap was typically worn by the inhabitants of Phrygia, in the Anatolian peninsula, and is commonly mistaken for being a Pileus. The Pileus was a hat that in ancient Rome became a symbol of freed slaves, who were touched by their owners with a wooden pike before setting them free.
Laurel is another classical symbol. At the end of the ancient Olympic Games (and also the 2004 Summer Olympics), the winner was given a laurel crown, and since then it has symbolized triumph and glory.

<doc id="451975" wikidata="Q37677" url="?curid=451975" title="Francisco Solano López">
<text>Francisco Solano López Carrillo (24 July 1827 or 1826 – 1 March 1870) was a Paraguayan dictator, military officer and politician who served as President of Paraguay between 1862 and 1870, of which he served mostly during the Paraguayan War (1864–1870). He succeeded his father Carlos Antonio López as the second president of Paraguay. He is the only Paraguayan president to have been killed in action. He is one of only two Paraguayans to have received the rank of Marshal, along with José Félix Estigarribia. He is officially recognized as the country&#x27;s national hero since the presidency of Colonel Rafael Franco between 1936 and 1937 after decades of liberal governments that rejected his figure as heroic. The date of his birth, July 24, is officially recognized as the Paraguayan Army Day, while the date of his death, March 1, is officially recognized as the National Heroes&#x27; Day and is a national holiday in the country.

At a very young age, he served in the Paraguayan Army fighting against Juan Manuel de Rosas in the sporadic hostilities sustained by Paraguay and Argentina during the Platine Wars. After the downfall of Rosas, he became Ambassador of Paraguay, as Minister Plenipotentiary, in several European countries from 1853 to 1855. At his return to Asunción, he was appointed Vice-President of the Supreme Government of his father Carlos, and then assumed the presidency when his father died.

He is one of the most controversial figures in South American history, particularly because of the Paraguayan War, known in the Plate Basin as &quot;the War of the Triple Alliance&quot; (). At least 50% of Paraguayans died during the war, numbers to which it took many decades for the country to return. 

From one perspective, his ambitions were the main reason for the outbreak of the war while other arguments maintain he was a fierce champion of the independence of South American nations against foreign rule and interests. He was killed in action during the Battle of Cerro Corá, which marked the end of the war.

== Life and career ==

=== Life before the war ===

Solano López was born in Manorá, a &quot;barrio&quot; of Asunción in 1827, or according to other sources, 1826. His father, Carlos Antonio López, ascended to the Paraguayan Presidency in 1841 following the death of the nation&#x27;s longtime dictator, José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia. The elder López would commission his son as a brigadier general in the Paraguayan Army, at the age of 17, in 1844. During the Argentine Civil Wars, Solano López was appointed commander-in-chief of Paraguayan forces stationed along the Argentine frontier. He pursued his early military studies in Rio de Janeiro and Asunción, specializing in fortifications and artillery.
Solano López was dispatched to Europe in 1853 as minister plenipotentiary to Britain, France, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. López went on to spend over a year and a half in Europe, most of it in Paris. He purchased large quantities of arms and military supplies, together with several steamers, on behalf of the Paraguayan military. He also modernized the Paraguayan Army with the novelties he acquired in Europe, adopting the French Code and the Prussian System of military organization (receiving some praise for this innovation many years later). His diplomatic work also included organizing a project to build a new railroad and efforts to establish a French émigré colony in Paraguay. He installed the first electric telegraph in South America. López also became a great admirer of the Second French Empire and developed a fascination with Napoleon Bonaparte. López later equipped his army with uniforms designed to match those of the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; and it was said that he also ordered for himself an exact replica of Napoleon&#x27;s crown, yet this remains unproven.

It was also during his time in France that Solano López met a Parisian courtesan, the Irish-born Eliza Lynch, and brought her with him back to Paraguay. There she was his concubine and &quot;de facto&quot; first lady till his death.

Solano López returned from Europe in 1855 and his father appointed him Minister of War. He was elevated to the office of Vice President of Paraguay in 1862.

In November 1859, López was on board the Paraguayan steamer &quot;Tacuari&quot;, which was captured by Royal Navy ships attempting to pressure his father into releasing a British citizen from prison. The British consul who ordered the action was Sir William Dougal Christie, who had been replaced by Edward Thornton, who adopted a far less aggressive tone compared to Christie.

With his father&#x27;s death in 1862, López convened the Congress of Paraguay, and was unanimously proclaimed President of Paraguay for a term of ten years.

== Presidency ==
After taking office, López opted to continue most of the policies of economic protectionism and internal development adopted by his predecessors. However, he broke sharply with the traditional policy of strict isolationism in foreign affairs that was favoured by previous Paraguayan leaders. López instead embarked on a more activist approach to international policy. He had, as his great ambition, to position Paraguay as a credible &quot;third force&quot; in the ongoing rivalry between Argentina and the Empire of Brazil over control of the Rio de la Plata Basin.

López wanted Paraguay to compete with the continent&#x27;s major powers in the struggle for spoils and regional dominance. In pursuit of this goal, López sought to organize the region&#x27;s smaller nations into a political coalition designed to offset the power and influence of the Brazilians and the Argentines. López found an eager ally in Uruguayan President Bernardo Berro, another leader whose country was frequently menaced by the various intrigues of the continent&#x27;s two great powers. Berro and López would quickly conclude an alliance and López would begin a massive expansion and reorganization of the Paraguayan military, introducing mandatory military service for all men along with other reforms.

Under López, Paraguay grew to possess one of the best-trained but ill-equipped military in the region. He bought new weapons from France and England but they failed to arrive because of the blockade imposed by the allies when the war broke out.

=== Role in beginning the war ===

In 1863, the Empire of Brazil—which did not have friendly relations with Paraguay—began providing military and political support to an incipient rebellion in Uruguay led by Venancio Flores and his Colorado Party against the Blanco Party government of Bernardo Berro and his successor, Atanasio Aguirre. The besieged Uruguayans repeatedly asked for military assistance from their Paraguayan allies against the Brazilian-backed rebels. López manifested his support for Aguirre&#x27;s government via a letter to Brazil, in which he said that any occupation of Uruguayan lands by Brazil would be considered an attack on Paraguay.

When Brazil did not heed the letter and invaded Uruguay on 12 October 1864, López seized the Brazilian merchant steamer &quot;Marqués de Olinda&quot; in the harbour of Asunción, and imprisoned the Brazilian governor of the province of Mato Grosso, who was on board. In the following month (December 1864) López formally declared war on Brazil and dispatched a force to invade Mato Grosso. The force seized and sacked the town of Corumbá and took possession of the province and its diamond mines, together with an immense quantity of arms and ammunition, including enough gunpowder to last the whole Paraguayan Army for at least a year of active war. However, Paraguayan forces could not or would not seize the capital city of Cuiabá, in northern Mato Grosso.

López next intended to send troops to Uruguay to support the government of Atanasio Aguirre, yet when he requested permission from Argentina to cross onto its soil, President Bartolomé Mitre refused to allow the Paraguayan force to cross the intervening province of Corrientes. By this time the Brazilians had managed to successfully topple Aguirre and install their ally Venancio Flores as president, rendering Uruguay little more than a Brazilian puppet state.

The Paraguayan Congress, summoned by López, bestowed him the title of &quot;Marshal-President&quot; of the Paraguayan Armies (an equivalent of Grand Marshal, he was the only Paraguayan who gained that rank in his own lifetime) and gave him extraordinary war powers. On 13 April 1865, he declared war on Argentina, seizing two Argentine war vessels in the Bay of Corrientes. The next day, he occupied the town of Corrientes, instituted a provisional government of his Argentine partisans, and announced that Paraguay had annexed Corrientes Province and Argentina&#x27;s Entre Ríos Province.

On 1 May 1865, Brazil joined Argentina and Uruguay in signing the Treaty of the Triple Alliance, which stipulated that they should unitedly pursue war with Paraguay until the existing government of Paraguay was overthrown and &quot;until no arms or elements of war should be left to it&quot;. This agreement was literally carried out. This treaty also stipulated that more than half of the Paraguayan territories would be conquered by the Allies after the war. The treaty, when made public, caused international outrage and voices rose in favour of Paraguay.

=== War of the Triple Alliance ===
The war which ensued, lasting until 1 March 1870, was carried on with great stubbornness and with alternating fortunes, though López&#x27;s disasters steadily increased. His first major setback came on 11 June 1865, when the powerless Paraguayan fleet was destroyed by the Brazilian Navy at the Battle of Riachuelo, which gave the Allies control over the various waterways surrounding Paraguay and forced López to withdraw from Argentina.

On 12 September 1866, López invited Mitre to a conference in Yataytí Corá. López believed that the time was right to treat for peace and was ready to sign a peace treaty with the Allies. No agreement was reached though since Mitre&#x27;s conditions were that every article of the Treaty of the Triple Alliance was still to be carried out, a condition which López refused. Regardless of López&#x27;s refusal, a peace treaty was not something Mitre could guarantee except on the terms of article VI of the treaty which stated that &quot;The allies pledge themselves solemnly not to lay down their arms unless by common accord, nor until they have overthrown the present Government of Paraguay, nor to treat with the enemy separately, nor sign any Treaty of peace, truce, armistice, or Convention whatsoever for putting an end or suspending the war, unless by a perfect agreement of all&quot;.

In 1868, when the allies were pressing him hard, he convinced himself that his Paraguayan supporters had actually formed a conspiracy against his life. Thereupon, several hundred prominent Paraguayan citizens were seized and executed by his order, including his brothers and brothers-in-law, cabinet ministers, judges, prefects, military officers, bishops and priests, and nine-tenths of the civil officers, together with more than two hundred foreigners, among them several members of the diplomatic legations (the San Fernando massacre). During this time, he also had his 70-year-old mother flogged and ordered her execution because she revealed to him that he had been born out of wedlock.

Ramona Martínez, who worked as a nurse in the war, had been enslaved by López; for her fighting and rallying of soldiers, she was nicknamed &quot;the American Joan of Arc&quot;.

==== Battle of Cerro Corá ====

Allied troops captured the Paraguayan capital city of Asunción on 1 January 1869, forcing López and what remained of his army and government to flee to the countryside. By late 1869, López was at last driven with a handful of troops to the northern frontier of Paraguay. He arrived at Cerro Corá on 14 February 1870. Two detachments were sent in pursuit of Solano López, who was accompanied by 200 men in the forests in the north, where he received news of the considerable Brazilian forces that were closing in on him. This caused some of the officials who were still with López to abandon him and approach the allied force, under the command of the Brazilian General José Antônio Correia da Câmara, which they readily joined as scouts in order to lead them to López.
Upon hearing about this, López called a last war council with the remaining officers of his general staff in order to decide the course of action for the upcoming battle: whether they should escape into the rainforest hill range or stay and make a stand against the attackers. The council decided to stay and end the war once and for all by fighting to the death.

The Brazilian force reached the camp on 1 March. During the battle that ensued, López was separated from the remainder of his army and was accompanied by only his aide and a couple of officers. He had been wounded with a spear in the stomach and hit with a sword in the side of his head and so was too weak to walk by himself. They led him to the Aquidabangui stream, and there they left him on the pretext of getting reinforcements.

While López was alone with his aide, General Câmara arrived along with six soldiers and approached him, calling on him to surrender and guaranteeing his life. López refused and shouting &quot;¡Muero con mi patria!&quot;, (&quot;I die with my nation!&quot;), tried to attack Câmara with his sword. Câmara ordered him to be disarmed, but López died during the struggle with the soldiers who were trying to disarm him. This incident marked the end of the war of the Triple Alliance.

== Legacy ==
During the War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguay lost 25–33% of its territory to Argentina and Brazil. The worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population. At least 50% of Paraguayans died during the conflict, numbers to which it took many decades for the country to return. Of the disaster suffered by the Paraguayans at the outcome of the war, William D. Rubinstein wrote: &quot;The normal estimate is that of a Paraguayan population of somewhere between 450,000 and 900,000, only 220,000 survived the war, of whom only 28,000 were adult males.&quot;

There is a debate within Paraguay as to whether he was a fearless leader who led his troops to the end or whether he foolishly led Paraguay into a war that it could never win and nearly eliminated the country from the map. The debate was not helped by the revisionist stance taken by the Stroessner regime on national history.

Conversely, he is considered by some Latin Americans as a champion for the rights of smaller nations against the imperialism of more powerful neighbours. For example, Eduardo Galeano argues that he and his father continued the work of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia in defending Paraguay as &quot;the only country that foreign capital had not deformed&quot;.

There is an ongoing debate in Paraguay among historians on López&#x27;s final words. The two versions are &quot;Muero por mi patria&quot; (&quot;I die for my nation&quot;) or &quot;Muero con mi patria&quot; (&quot;I die with my nation&quot;). (The latter may have been based on the testament of Luís de Camões.) In any case, Juan Silvano Godoi wrote on the event:

Marshal López died profoundly convinced that, along with him, the independence of Paraguay would disappear. He acquired this conviction upon learning that the allies had organized in Asuncion a &quot;temporary government&quot; made up of the Paraguayans who had taken arms against their government and fought for the Triple Alliance army.

On 1 March, a national holiday in Paraguay, &quot;Día de los Héroes&quot; (Heroes&#x27; Day) is held in honour of López&#x27;s memory. It is the most important holiday in the country after Independence Day. López is still considered to be the greatest Paraguayan national hero, and his remains are located at the National Pantheon of the Heroes in Asunción. It is customary in Asunción that when something historically worth celebrating happens (such as the victory of the former President Fernando Lugo in the 2008 elections), people flock with their flags to the street in front of the Pantheon and celebrate the event.
In 2007, Argentine President Cristina Kirchner named an Argentinean unit, the 2nd Armored Artillery Group, after Marshal Francisco Solano López. During the ceremony, the national anthems of both nations were sung and high-ranking officers of both armies were present. The Chief of the Argentine Army gave a speech at the event in which he stated: 

Talking about the Paraguayan Army and the Argentine Army is talking of one and the same thing. Today, in the Argentine army, honored by the visit of Paraguay&#x27;s Army Commandant, we are working intensely in fulfilling the dream of the fathers of our nation. Of those men who wanted to build a great nation, General José de San Martín and, precisely, Marshal López. 
Afterwards, Lieutenant General Bendini said:

Marshal López inspired in his men a spirit and love for their land which made them prefer to die rather than surrender. He is an example of what a leader is, a driver, a man who knows how to reach to his people. I am sure that the men of this artillery group will take to the example of this brave Paraguayan soldier and will be deemed worthy of the name their unit bears.
At the end of the ceremony, the Paraguayan Army Commandant presented the unit with a portrait of López. Commenting, a leader in the Buenos Aires &quot;La Nación&quot;, a newspaper founded by Bartolomé Mitre, said under the headline &quot;Absurd tribute to a dictator&quot;, &quot;Naming a military unit after the dictator who trampled on the [Argentine] flag is as absurd as if France or Poland called one of their regiments &#x27;Adolf Hitler&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="451980" wikidata="Q141632" url="?curid=451980" title="Calibrachoa">
<text>Calibrachoa is a genus of plants in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family. They are evergreen short-lived perennials and subshrubs with a sprawling habit, with small petunia-type flowers. They are found across much the same region of South America as petunias, from southern Brazil across to Peru and Chile, inhabiting scrub and open grassland.

==Classification==
&quot;Calibrachoa&quot; are closely related to &quot;Petunia&quot;. However, on further examination it has been found that there are major differences in chromosomes, corresponding to external differences and fertilization factors that distinguished the two genera. &quot;Petchoa&quot; is a hybrid genus derived from crossing the genetically similar Calibrachoa and Petunia.

&quot;Calibrachoa&quot; was named by Vicente Cervantes after Antonio de la Cal y Bracho, a 19th-century Mexican botanist and pharmacologist.

==Description==
&quot;Calibrachoa&quot; are small shrubs or herbaceous plants with woody shoot axis that grow annual or perennial. The leaves are ovate, elliptic, reverse ovate or linear; its edge is flat or rolled back. The inflorescences are monochasial and have oppositely standing, foliage-like bracts. The flowers are usually zygomorphic, the bud cover is reciprocal in most species, the only exception is &quot;Calibrachoa pygmaea&quot; in both cases. The calyx has five or ten ribs, it is usually lobed to about the middle, the lobes are usually narrowed towards the top. The crown is funnel-shaped, but in &quot;Calibrachoa pygmaea&quot; it is salver-shaped, bulbous and tapered towards the tip. The color of the crown can be purple, red, pink or whitish.

The fruits are capsules. The seeds have a net-like surface. This structure is due to walls perpendicular to the seed surface, which are straight in all species.

==Species==

28 species, including:
==Cultivation==
Some &quot;Calibrachoa&quot; are cultivated as ornamental plants, popularly known as &quot;Million Bells&quot;. The plants can tolerate light frost and thrive in sun or semi-shade. Plant in a free-draining soil and water only when the soil is almost dry. They can be propagated from tip cuttings, but are frequently grown as half-hardy annuals. They are suitable for container gardening and hanging baskets and will attract hummingbirds.

===Cultivars===
The following cultivars are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-
*=&#x27;Balcabrite&#x27; 
*=&#x27;Wescapido&#x27; 
*=&#x27;Sunbelrikubu&#x27;

<doc id="451981" wikidata="Q474090" url="?curid=451981" title="Narrative poetry">
<text>Narrative poetry is a form of poetry that tells a story, often using the voices of both a narrator and characters; the entire story is usually written in metered verse. Narrative poems do not need to rhyme. The poems that make up this genre may be short or long, and the story it relates to may be complex. It is normally dramatic, with various characters. Narrative poems include all epic poetry, and the various types of &quot;lay&quot;, most ballads, and some idylls, as well as many poems not falling into a distinct type.

Some narrative poetry takes the form of a novel in verse. An example of this is &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; by Robert Browning. In terms of narrative poetry, romance is a narrative poem that tells a story of chivalry. Examples include the &quot;Romance of the Rose&quot; or Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;. Although those examples use medieval and Arthurian materials, romances may also tell stories from classical mythology. Sometimes, these short narratives are collected into interrelated groups, as with Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. So sagas include both incidental poetry and the biographies of poets.

==Oral tradition==
The oral tradition is the predecessor of essentially all other modern forms of communication. For thousands of years, cultures passed on their history through oral tradition from generation to generation. Historically, much of poetry has its source in an oral tradition: in more recent times the Scots and English ballads, the tales of Robin Hood poems all were originally intended for recitation, rather than reading. In many cultures, there remains a lively tradition of the recitation of traditional tales in verse format. It has been suggested that some of the distinctive features that distinguish poetry from prose, such as metre, alliteration, and kennings, at one time served as memory aids that allowed the bards who recited traditional tales to reconstruct them from memory.

A narrative poem usually tells a story using a poetic theme. Epics are very vital to narrative poems, although it is thought those narrative poems were created to explain oral traditions. The focus of narrative poetry is often the pros and cons of life.

<text>John Doe is an American science fiction drama television series that aired on Fox during the 2002–2003 TV season.

==Synopsis==
In the opening scene of the series&#x27; pilot episode, a mysterious man awakens on an island off the coast of Seattle, Washington, naked, with absolutely no memory of who he is or how he got there. However, apart from the details of his own past, &quot;John Doe&quot;, as he comes to call himself, seems to have access to the sum total of all human knowledge: he knows how many dimples are on a golf ball, the population of Morocco, and other such obscure (and not-so-obscure) facts. He also has expert knowledge on everything from the stock market to computers. Over the course of the series John attempts to find clues about his past by using his unusual ability while also helping to solve crimes with the Seattle police department. In the process it becomes clear that an international conspiracy known as the Phoenix Organization is watching John&#x27;s every move.

==Who is John Doe?==
Due to the series&#x27; cancellation, the final episode ended with an unresolved cliffhanger, revealing that Digger, John&#x27;s close friend, was in fact the leader of the Phoenix Organization. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, series creators Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson revealed what would have happened and John Doe&#x27;s true identity.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 73% with an average rating of 7/10 based on 26 reviews, with a critical consensus stating: &quot;&quot;John Doe&quot; overcomes its somewhat dubious premise with an alluring sense of mystery and a nuanced performance from Dominic Purcell.&quot; Phil Gallo of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s so stylishly executed, with Mimi Leder&#x27;s direction, a crisp script and magnetic lead by Dominic Purcell, that the John Doe indeed has a solid identity.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, Felix Klein&#x27;s -invariant or function, regarded as a function of a complex variable , is a modular function of weight zero for special linear group defined on the upper half-plane of complex numbers. It is the unique such function that is holomorphic away from a simple pole at the cusp such that

:formula_1

Rational functions of are modular, and in fact give all modular functions of weight 0. Classically, the -invariant was studied as a parameterization of elliptic curves over formula_2, but it also has surprising connections to the symmetries of the Monster group (this connection is referred to as monstrous moonshine).

==Definition==


The -invariant can be defined as a function on the upper half-plane 

:formula_3

with the third definition implying formula_4 can be expressed as a cube, also since 1728formula_5. The function cannot be continued analytically beyond the upper half-plane due to the natural boundary at the real line.

The given functions are the modular discriminant formula_6, Dedekind eta function formula_7, and modular invariants,

:formula_8
:formula_9

where formula_10, formula_11 are Fourier series,

:formula_12

and formula_13, formula_14 are Eisenstein series,

:formula_15

and formula_16 (the square of the nome). The -invariant can then be directly expressed in terms of the Eisenstein series as,

:formula_17

with no numerical factor other than 1728. This implies a third way to define the modular discriminant,

:formula_18

For example, using the definitions above and formula_19, then the Dedekind eta function formula_20 has the exact value,

:formula_21

implying the transcendental numbers,

:formula_22

but yielding the algebraic number (in fact, an integer),

:formula_23

In general, this can be motivated by viewing each as representing an isomorphism class of elliptic curves. Every elliptic curve over is a complex torus, and thus can be identified with a rank 2 lattice; that is, a two-dimensional lattice of . This lattice can be rotated and scaled (operations that preserve the isomorphism class), so that it is generated by and . This lattice corresponds to the elliptic curve formula_24 (see Weierstrass elliptic functions).

Note that is defined everywhere in as the modular discriminant is non-zero. This is due to the corresponding cubic polynomial having distinct roots.

==The fundamental region==
It can be shown that is a modular form of weight twelve, and one of weight four, so that its third power is also of weight twelve. Thus their quotient, and therefore , is a modular function of weight zero, in particular a holomorphic function invariant under the action of . Quotienting out by its centre yields the modular group, which we may identify with the projective special linear group .

By a suitable choice of transformation belonging to this group,

:formula_25

we may reduce to a value giving the same value for , and lying in the fundamental region for , which consists of values for satisfying the conditions

:formula_26

The function when restricted to this region still takes on every value in the complex numbers exactly once. In other words, for every in , there is a unique τ in the fundamental region such that . Thus, has the property of mapping the fundamental region to the entire complex plane.

Additionally two values produce the same elliptic curve iff for some . This means provides a bijection from the set of elliptic curves over to the complex plane.

As a Riemann surface, the fundamental region has genus , and every (level one) modular function is a rational function in ; and, conversely, every rational function in is a modular function. In other words, the field of modular functions is .

==Class field theory and ==

The -invariant has many remarkable properties:

*If is any point of the upper half plane whose corresponding elliptic curve has complex multiplication (that is, if is any element of an imaginary quadratic field with positive imaginary part, so that is defined), then is an algebraic integer. These special values are called singular moduli.
* The field extension is abelian, that is, it has an abelian Galois group.
* Let be the lattice in generated by It is easy to see that all of the elements of which fix under multiplication form a ring with units, called an order. The other lattices with generators associated in like manner to the same order define the algebraic conjugates of over . Ordered by inclusion, the unique maximal order in is the ring of algebraic integers of , and values of having it as its associated order lead to unramified extensions of .

These classical results are the starting point for the theory of complex multiplication.

==Transcendence properties==
In 1937 Theodor Schneider proved the aforementioned result that if is a quadratic irrational number in the upper half plane then is an algebraic integer. In addition he proved that if is an algebraic number but not imaginary quadratic then is transcendental.

The function has numerous other transcendental properties. Kurt Mahler conjectured a particular transcendence result that is often referred to as Mahler&#x27;s conjecture, though it was proved as a corollary of results by Yu. V. Nesterenko and Patrice Phillipon in the 1990s. Mahler&#x27;s conjecture (now proven) is that, if is in the upper half plane, then and are never both simultaneously algebraic. Stronger results are now known, for example if is algebraic then the following three numbers are algebraically independent, and thus at least two of them transcendental:

:formula_27

==The -expansion and moonshine==
Several remarkable properties of have to do with its -expansion (Fourier series expansion), written as a Laurent series in terms of , which begins:

:formula_28

Note that has a simple pole at the cusp, so its -expansion has no terms below .

All the Fourier coefficients are integers, which results in several almost integers, notably Ramanujan&#x27;s constant:

:formula_29.

The asymptotic formula for the coefficient of is given by

:formula_30,

as can be proved by the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.

===Moonshine===
More remarkably, the Fourier coefficients for the positive exponents of are the dimensions of the graded part of an infinite-dimensional graded algebra representation of the monster group called the &quot;moonshine module&quot; – specifically, the coefficient of is the dimension of grade- part of the moonshine module, the first example being the Griess algebra, which has dimension 196,884, corresponding to the term . This startling observation, first made by John McKay, was the starting point for moonshine theory.

The study of the Moonshine conjecture led John Horton Conway and Simon P. Norton to look at the genus-zero modular functions. If they are normalized to have the form

:formula_31

then John G. Thompson showed that there are only a finite number of such functions (of some finite level), and Chris J. Cummins later showed that there are exactly 6486 of them, 616 of which have integral coefficients.

==Alternate expressions==
We have

:formula_32

where and is the modular lambda function

:formula_33

a ratio of Jacobi theta functions , and is the square of the elliptic modulus . The value of is unchanged when is replaced by any of the six values of the cross-ratio:

:formula_34

The branch points of are at , so that is a Belyi function.

==Expressions in terms of theta functions==

Define the nome and the Jacobi theta function,

:formula_35

from which one can derive the auxiliary theta functions, defined here. Let,

:formula_36

where and are alternative notations, and . Then we have the for modular invariants , , 

:formula_37

and modular discriminant,

:formula_38

with Dedekind eta function . The can then be rapidly computed,

:formula_39

==Algebraic definition==
So far we have been considering as a function of a complex variable. However, as an invariant for isomorphism classes of elliptic curves, it can be defined purely algebraically. Let

:formula_40

be a plane elliptic curve &quot;over any field&quot;. Then we may perform successive transformations to get the above equation into the standard form (note that this transformation can only be made when the characteristic of the field is not equal to 2 or 3). The resulting coefficients are:

:formula_41

where and . We also have the discriminant

:formula_42

The -invariant for the elliptic curve may now be defined as

:formula_43

In the case that the field over which the curve is defined has characteristic different from 2 or 3, this is equal to

:formula_44

==Inverse function==
The inverse function of the -invariant can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function (see also the article Picard–Fuchs equation). Explicitly, given a number , to solve the equation for can be done in at least four ways.

Method 1: Solving the sextic in ,

:formula_45

where , and is the modular lambda function so the sextic can be solved as a cubic in . Then,

:formula_46

for any of the six values of {{mvar|λ}}, where {{math|M}} is the arithmetic–geometric mean.

Method 2: Solving the quartic in {{mvar|γ}},

:formula_47

then for any of the four roots,

:formula_48

Method 3: Solving the cubic in {{mvar|β}},

:formula_49

then for any of the three roots,

:formula_50

Method 4: Solving the quadratic in {{mvar|α}},

:formula_51

then,

:formula_52

One root gives {{mvar|τ}}, and the other gives {{math|−{{sfrac|1|&quot;τ&quot;}}}}, but since {{math|&quot;j&quot;(&quot;τ&quot;) {{=}} &quot;j&quot;(−{{sfrac|1|&quot;τ&quot;}})}}, it makes no difference which {{mvar|α}} is chosen. The latter three methods can be found in Ramanujan&#x27;s theory of elliptic functions to alternative bases.

The inversion is applied in high-precision calculations of elliptic function periods even as their ratios become unbounded.{{cn|date=December 2021}} A related result is the expressibility via quadratic radicals of the values of {{mvar|j}} at the points of the imaginary axis whose magnitudes are powers of 2 (thus permitting compass and straightedge constructions). The latter result is hardly evident since the modular equation for {{math|&quot;j&quot;}} of order 2 is cubic.

==Pi formulas==

The Chudnovsky brothers found in 1987,

:formula_53

a proof of which uses the fact that

:formula_54

For similar formulas, see the Ramanujan–Sato series.

== Failure to classify elliptic curves over other fields ==
The formula_55-invariant is only sensitive to isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over the complex numbers, or more generally, an algebraically closed field. Over other fields there exist examples of elliptic curves whose formula_55-invariant is the same, but are non-isomorphic. For example, let formula_57 be the elliptic curves associated to the polynomialsformula_58both having formula_55-invariant formula_60. Then, the rational points of formula_61 can be computed as:formula_62since formula_63 There are no rational solutions with formula_64. This can be shown using Cardano&#x27;s formula to show that in that case the solutions to formula_65 are all irrational. 

On the other hand, on the set of pointsformula_66 the equation for formula_67 becomes formula_68. Dividing by formula_69 to eliminate the formula_70 solution, the quadratic formula gives the rational solutions: formula_71If these curves are considered over formula_72, there is an isomorphism formula_73 sendingformula_74

A NAS device is optimised for serving files either by its hardware, software, or configuration. It is often manufactured as a computer appliance a purpose-built specialized computer. NAS systems are networked appliances that contain one or more storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID. Network-attached storage typically provide access to files using network file sharing protocols such as NFS, SMB, or AFP. From the mid-1990s, NAS devices began gaining popularity as a convenient method of sharing files among multiple computers, as well as to remove the responsibility of file serving from other servers on the network; by doing so, a NAS can provide faster data access, easier administration, and simpler configuration as opposed to using general-purpose server to serve files.

Accompanying a NAS are purpose-built hard disk drives, which are functionally similar to non-NAS drives but may have different firmware, vibration tolerance, or power dissipation to make them more suitable for use in RAID arrays, a technology often used in NAS implementations. For example, some NAS versions of drives support a command extension to allow extended error recovery to be disabled. In a non-RAID application, it may be important for a disk drive to go to great lengths to successfully read a problematic storage block, even if it takes several seconds. In an appropriately configured RAID array, a single bad block on a single drive can be recovered completely via the redundancy encoded across the RAID set. If a drive spends several seconds executing extensive retries it might cause the RAID controller to flag the drive as &quot;down&quot; whereas if it simply replied promptly that the block of data had a checksum error, the RAID controller would use the redundant data on the other drives to correct the error and continue without any problem.

== Description ==
A NAS unit is a computer connected to a network that provides only file-based data storage services to other devices on the network. Although it may technically be possible to run other software on a NAS unit, it is usually not designed to be a general-purpose server. For example, NAS units usually do not have a keyboard or display, and are controlled and configured over the network, often using a browser.

A full-featured operating system is not needed on a NAS device, so often a stripped-down operating system is used.

NAS systems contain one or more hard disk drives, often arranged into logical, redundant storage containers or RAID.

NAS uses file-based protocols such as NFS (popular on UNIX systems), SMB (Server Message Block) (used with Microsoft Windows systems), AFP (used with Apple Macintosh computers), or NCP (used with OES and Novell NetWare). NAS units rarely limit clients to a single protocol.

=== Comparing with DAS ===
The key difference between direct-attached storage (DAS) and NAS is that DAS is simply an extension to an existing server and is not necessarily networked. As the name suggests, DAS typically is connected via a USB or Thunderbolt enabled cable. NAS is designed as an easy and self-contained solution for sharing files over the network.

Both DAS and NAS can potentially increase availability of data by using RAID or clustering.

Both NAS and DAS can have various amount of cache memory, which greatly affects performance. When comparing use of NAS with use of local (non-networked) DAS, the performance of NAS depends mainly on the speed of and congestion on the network.

NAS is generally not as customizable in terms of hardware (CPU, memory, storage components) or low level software (extensions, plug-ins, additional protocols) but most NAS solutions will include the option to install a wide array of software applications to allow better configuration of the system or to include other capabilities outside of storage (like video surveillance, virtualization, media, etc). DAS typically is focused solely on data storage but capabilities can be available based on specific vendor options.

=== Comparing with SAN ===

NAS provides both storage and a file system. This is often contrasted with SAN (storage area network), which provides only block-based storage and leaves file system concerns on the &quot;client&quot; side. SAN protocols include Fibre Channel, iSCSI, ATA over Ethernet (AoE) and HyperSCSI.

One way to loosely conceptualize the difference between a NAS and a SAN is that NAS appears to the client OS (operating system) as a file server (the client can map network drives to shares on that server) whereas a disk available through a SAN still appears to the client OS as a disk, visible in disk and volume management utilities (along with client&#x27;s local disks), and available to be formatted with a file system and mounted.

Despite their differences, SAN and NAS are not mutually exclusive and may be combined as a SAN-NAS hybrid, offering both file-level protocols (NAS) and block-level protocols (SAN) from the same system. A shared disk file system can also be run on top of a SAN to provide filesystem services.

== History ==
In the early 1980s, the &quot;Newcastle Connection&quot; by Brian Randell and his colleagues at Newcastle University demonstrated and developed remote file access across a set of UNIX machines. Novell&#x27;s NetWare server operating system and NCP protocol was released in 1983. Following the Newcastle Connection, Sun Microsystems&#x27; 1984 release of NFS allowed network servers to share their storage space with networked clients. 3Com and Microsoft would develop the LAN Manager software and protocol to further this new market. 3Com&#x27;s 3Server and 3+Share software was the first purpose-built server (including proprietary hardware, software, and multiple disks) for open systems servers.

Inspired by the success of file servers from Novell, IBM, and Sun, several firms developed dedicated file servers. While 3Com was among the first firms to build a dedicated NAS for desktop operating systems, Auspex Systems was one of the first to develop a dedicated NFS server for use in the UNIX market. A group of Auspex engineers split away in the early 1990s to create the integrated NetApp FAS, which supported both the Windows SMB and the UNIX NFS protocols and had superior scalability and ease of deployment. This started the market for proprietary NAS devices now led by NetApp and EMC Celerra.

Starting in the early 2000s, a series of startups emerged offering alternative solutions to single filer solutions in the form of clustered NAS Spinnaker Networks (acquired by NetApp in February 2004), Exanet (acquired by Dell in February 2010), Gluster (acquired by RedHat in 2011), ONStor (acquired by LSI in 2009), IBRIX (acquired by HP), Isilon (acquired by EMC November 2010), PolyServe (acquired by HP in 2007), and Panasas, to name a few.

In 2009, NAS vendors (notably CTERA networks and Netgear) began to introduce online backup solutions integrated in their NAS appliances, for online disaster recovery.

By 2021, three major types of NAS solutions are offered (all with hybrid cloud models where data can be stored both on-premise on the NAS and off site on a separate NAS or through a public cloud service provider). The first type of NAS is focused on consumer needs with lower-cost options that typically support 1–5 hot plug hard drives. The second is focused on small-to-medium-sized businesses – these NAS solutions range from 2–24+ hard drives and are typically offered in tower or rackmount form factors. Pricing can vary greatly depending on the processor, components, and overall features supported. The last type is geared toward enterprises or large businesses and are offered with more advanced software capabilities. NAS solutions are typically sold without hard drives installed to allow the buyer (or IT departments) to select the hard drive cost, size, and quality.

== Implementation ==
The way manufacturers make NAS devices can be classified into three types:

# Computer-based NAS using a computer (server level or a personal computer) with processors typically from Intel or AMD, installs FTP/SMB/AFP... software server. The power consumption of this NAS type is the largest, but its functions are the most powerful. Some large NAS manufacturers such as Synology, QNAP systems, and Asus make these types of devices. Max FTP throughput speed varies by computer CPU and amount of RAM.
# Embedded-system-based NAS using an ARM- or MIPS-based processor architecture and a real-time operating system (RTOS) or an embedded operating system to run a NAS server. The power consumption of this NAS type is fair, and functions in the NAS can fit most end-user requirements. Marvell, Oxford, and Storlink make chipsets for this type of NAS. Max FTP throughput varies from 20 MB/s to 120 MB/s.
# ASIC-based NAS provisioning NAS through the use of a single ASIC chip, using hardware to implement TCP/IP and file system. There is no OS in the chip, as all the performance-related operations are done by hardware acceleration circuits. The power consumption of this type of NAS is low, as functions are limited to only support SMB and FTP. LayerWalker is the only chipset manufacturer for this type of NAS. Max FTP throughput is 40 MB/s.

== Uses ==
NAS is useful for more than just general centralized storage provided to client computers in environments with large amounts of data. NAS can enable simpler and lower cost systems such as load-balancing and fault-tolerant email and web server systems by providing storage services. The potential emerging market for NAS is the consumer market where there is a large amount of multi-media data. Such consumer market appliances are now commonly available. Unlike their rackmounted counterparts, they are generally packaged in smaller form factors. The price of NAS appliances has fallen sharply in recent years, offering flexible network-based storage to the home consumer market for little more than the cost of a regular USB or FireWire external hard disk. Many of these home consumer devices are built around ARM, x86 or MIPS processors running an embedded Linux operating system.

A purpose-built backup appliance (PBBA) is a kind of NAS intended for storing backup data. PBBAs typically include data deduplication, compression, RAID 6 or other redundant hardware components, and automated maintenance.
A PBBA may also be called a backup and disaster recovery appliance or simply a backup appliance.

== Examples ==
=== Open-source server implementations ===
Open-source NAS-oriented distributions of Linux and FreeBSD are available. These are designed to be easy to set up on commodity PC hardware, and are typically configured using a web browser.

They can run from a virtual machine, Live CD, bootable USB flash drive (Live USB), or from one of the mounted hard drives. They run Samba (an SMB daemon), NFS daemon, and FTP daemons which are freely available for those operating systems.

=== Network-attached secure disks===
Network-attached secure disks (NASD) is 1997–2001 research project of Carnegie Mellon University, with the goal of providing cost-effective scalable storage bandwidth. NASD reduces the overhead on the file server (file manager) by allowing storage devices to transfer data directly to clients. Most of the file manager&#x27;s work is offloaded to the storage disk without integrating the file system policy into the disk. Most client operations like Read/Write go directly to the disks; less frequent operations like authentication go to the file manager. Disks transfer variable-length objects instead of fixed-size blocks to clients. The File Manager provides a time-limited cachable capability for clients to access the storage objects. A file access from the client to the disks has the following sequence:

# The client authenticates itself with the file manager and requests for the file access.
# If the client can be granted access to the file requested, the client receives the network location of NASD disks and their capability.
# If the client is accessing the disk for the first time, it receives a time-limited key for the establishment of secure communication to the disk.
# The file manager informs the corresponding disk using an independent channel.
# From now on, the client directly accesses the NASD disks by giving the capability it received and further data transfers go through the network, bypassing the file manager.

=== List of network protocols used to serve NAS ===

* Andrew File System (AFS)
* Apple Filing Protocol (AFP)
* Server Message Block (SMB)
* File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
* Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Network File System (NFS)
* 
* SSH file transfer protocol (SFTP)
* Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
== Clustered NAS ==

A clustered NAS is a NAS that is using a distributed file system running simultaneously on multiple servers. The key difference between a clustered and traditional NAS is the ability to distribute (e.g. stripe) data and metadata across the cluster nodes or storage devices. Clustered NAS, like a traditional one, still provides unified access to the files from any of the cluster nodes, unrelated to the actual location of the data.

<doc id="451996" wikidata="Q234491" url="?curid=451996" title="Junko Tabei">
<text>was a Japanese mountaineer, author, and teacher. She was the first woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest and ascend the Seven Summits, climbing the highest peak on every continent.

Tabei wrote seven books, organized environmental projects to clean up trash left behind by climbers on Everest, and led annual climbs up Mount Fuji for youth affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake.

An astronomer named asteroid 6897 Tabei after her and in 2019, a mountain range on Pluto was named Tabei Montes in her honor.

==Early life==

Junko Ishibashi was born on 22 September 1939 in Miharu, Fukushima, the fifth daughter of seven children. Her father was a printer. She was considered a frail child, but nevertheless she began mountain climbing at the age of ten, going on a class climbing trip to Mount Nasu. She enjoyed the non-competitive nature of the sport and the striking natural landscapes that came into view upon reaching the top of the mountain. Although she was interested in doing more climbing, her family did not have enough money for such an expensive hobby, and Ishibashi made only a few climbs during her high school years.

From 1958 to 1962, Ishibashi studied English and American literature at Showa Women&#x27;s University. She initially planned on a career as a teacher. After graduation, she returned to her earlier passion for climbing by joining a number of men&#x27;s climbing clubs. While some men welcomed her as a fellow climber, others questioned her motives for pursuing a typically male-dominated sport. Soon, Ishibashi had climbed all the major mountains in Japan, including Mount Fuji.

When she was 27, Ishibashi married Masanobu Tabei, a mountaineer she had met during a climbing excursion on Mount Tanigawa. The couple eventually had two children: a daughter, Noriko, and a son, Shinya.

==Career==
===Early climbing expeditions===
In 1969, Junko Tabei established the Joshi-Tohan Club (Women&#x27;s Mountaineering Club) for women only. The club&#x27;s slogan was &quot;Let&#x27;s go on an overseas expedition by ourselves&quot;, and the group was the first of its kind in Japan. Tabei later stated that she founded the club as a result of how she was treated by male mountaineers of the time; some men, for example, refused to climb with her, while others thought she was only interested in climbing as a way to find a husband. Tabei helped fund her climbing activities by working as an editor for the &quot;Journal of the Physical Society of Japan&quot;.

The Joshi-Tohan Club embarked on their first expedition in 1970, climbing the Nepalese mountain Annapurna III. They successfully reached the summit using a new route on the south side, achieving the first female and first Japanese ascent of the mountain. Tabei and one other member, Hiroko Hirakawa, were chosen to complete the final climb to the top, accompanied by two sherpa guides. The climbers had brought a camera, but the temperature was so cold that the camera&#x27;s film cracked.

From her experience in the Annapurna III ascent, Tabei realized that she and the other Japanese women had sometimes struggled to reconcile traditional Japanese values of quiet strength with the more immediate practical needs of mountaineering. Many Joshi-Tohan Club members were initially reluctant to admit they did not know something or needed assistance, preferring to keep a stoic silence, but mountain climbing forced the women to acknowledge their personal limits and accept help from each other.

===1975 Everest expedition===

After Tabei and Hirakawa successfully summited Annapurna III on 19 May 1970, the Joshi-Tohan Club decided to tackle Mount Everest. The club created a team known as the Japanese Women&#x27;s Everest Expedition (JWEE), led by Eiko Hisano, which would attempt to summit Mount Everest. JWEE contained 15 members, most of them working women who came from a range of professions. Two of the women, including Tabei, were mothers. They applied for a climbing permit for Everest in 1971, but had to wait four years to receive a place in the formal climbing schedule.

Tabei helped to find sponsors for the expedition, although she was frequently told that the women &quot;should be raising children instead&quot;. She was able to obtain last-minute funding from the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; newspaper and Nippon Television, but each group member still needed to pay 1.5 million yen (US$5,000). Tabei taught piano lessons to help raise the necessary funds. To save money, Tabei made much of her own equipment from scratch, creating waterproof gloves out of the cover of her car and sewing trousers from old curtains.

After a long training period, the team made the expedition in May 1975. The group attracted much media attention with their plans, and the 15 women were initially accompanied by journalists and a television camera crew as they began their climb. They used the same route to ascend the mountain that Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay had taken in 1953, and six sherpa guides assisted the team for the full span of the expedition. On 4 May, the team was camping at when an avalanche struck their camp. Tabei and four of her fellow climbers were buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness until sherpa guides dug her out. Luckily, there were no casualties. Bruised and injured by the incident, Tabei could barely walk and was forced to spend two days recovering. As soon as she was able, however, she resumed the expedition and continued leading her team up the mountain.

Although the team had originally planned to send two women up to the peak of Everest (accompanied by a sherpa), a bout of altitude sickness meant that the team&#x27;s sherpas could not carry the number of oxygen bottles required to accommodate two climbers. Only one woman could continue. After much discussion, Hisano nominated Tabei to complete the climb. Nearing the peak, Tabei was furious to discover that she would have to cross a thin, hazardous ridge of ice that had gone completely unmentioned in accounts by previous expeditions. She crawled along it sideways, later describing it as the most tense experience she had ever had. Twelve days after the avalanche, on 16 May 1975, with her sherpa guide Ang Tsering, Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of Everest.

Tabei was showered with attention as a result of her achievement. In Kathmandu, a parade was held in her honor. On her return to Japan, she was received at the Tokyo airport by thousands of cheering supporters. She received messages from the King of Nepal and the Japanese government, a television miniseries was made about the Everest expedition, and Tabei made personal appearances across Japan. However, Tabei remained uncomfortable with this level of fame. She later told media that she preferred to be remembered as the 36th person to summit Everest: &quot;I did not intend to be the first woman on Everest.&quot;
===Later activities===

Tabei continued her mountaineering pursuits, eventually climbing the highest mountain on each continent: Kilimanjaro (1980), Aconcagua (1987), Denali (1988), Elbrus (1989), Mount Vinson (1991), and Puncak Jaya (1992). Upon her successful climb of Puncak Jaya, she became the first woman to complete the Seven Summits. By 2005, Tabei had taken part in 44 all-female mountaineering expeditions around the world. She had a personal goal to climb the highest mountain in every country in the world, and by the end of her lifetime she had completed at least 70 of these mountains.

She never accepted corporate sponsorship after Mount Everest, preferring to remain financially independent. She saved money to fund her expeditions by making paid public appearances, guiding mountain-climbing tours, and tutoring local children in music and English. Tabei&#x27;s friends and supporters sometimes donated food and equipment.

In addition to her climbing, Tabei worked on ecological concerns; in 2000, she completed postgraduate studies at Kyushu University focusing on the environmental degradation of Everest caused by the waste left behind by climbing groups. Tabei was also the director of the Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, an organization working at a global level to preserve mountain environments. One of the trust&#x27;s projects was to build an incinerator to burn climbers&#x27; trash. She also led and participated in &quot;clean-up&quot; climbs in Japan and the Himalayas alongside her husband and children.

In May 2003, a celebration was held in Kathmandu to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first successful summit of Mount Everest, and crowds of Nepalese people gathered to cheer a procession of past Everest climbers. Tabei and Sir Edmund Hillary were given a special place in the festivities for their respective achievements.

Between 1996 and 2008, Tabei wrote and published seven books. Following the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, Tabei began organizing annual guided excursions up Mount Fuji for schoolchildren affected by the disaster.

==Death and legacy==
Tabei was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2012, but continued with many of her mountaineering activities. In July 2016, despite her advancing illness, she led a youth expedition up Mount Fuji. She died in a hospital in Kawagoe on 20 October 2016.

Before Tabei&#x27;s death, an astronomer had named asteroid 6897 Tabei after her.

On 22 September 2019, Google commemorated the 80th anniversary of her birth with a Doodle. The accompanying write-up gave her motivation slogan, &quot;Do not give up. Keep on your quest.&quot;

On 19 November 2019, a mountain range on Pluto was named Tabei Montes in honor of Tabei&#x27;s mountaineering accomplishments. The theme for naming mountains on Pluto is &quot;Historic pioneers who crossed new horizons in the exploration of the Earth, sea and sky&quot;.

<text>The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers&#x27; Union (BFAWU) is a trade union in the United Kingdom. Founded in 1847 in Manchester, it represents workers in the food industry.

==History==
The union dates its origin to 1847. The Manchester Friendly Association of Operative Bakers was established in 1849, and by 1854 it was led by Thomas Hodson. Under his leadership the union first expanded to represent bakers in Salford, becoming the first bakers&#x27; union in England to cover a wide area, though its membership remained below 200. In 1861 Hodson led the formation of the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, bringing together unions in Bristol, Cheltenham, Hanley, Liverpool, London, Newcastle, Warrington and Wigan, along with his Manchester society. The new union gained prominence when its campaign for improvements in working conditions led to the Bakehouse Regulations Act 1863.

In about 1870 the union relocated its headquarters to London, but the majority of its members were still in Lancashire. Other unions gradually joined, including the South Wales Federation of Journeymen Bakers in 1893. By 1891 the union had 4,000 members, nearly half of them in London. In 1902, the union officially affiliated to the Labour Party, which had been founded two years prior.

For many years the union did not admit workers whom it considered unskilled. This led its London organiser, C. Mann, to form the rival National Union of Bakery Trade Workers in 1913. The following year the Operative Bakers agreed to accept all workers in the industry, and renamed itself as the Amalgamated Union of Operative Bakers, Confectioners and Allied Workers of Great Britain and Ireland. Mann&#x27;s breakaway union was dissolved. In 1920 the union agreed to transfer its members in the milling industry to the rival Dock, Wharf and Riverside Workers&#x27; Union.

The union focused its campaigns on shorter working hours, better pay and working conditions. In 1919 it led a major strike against night work, but this was unsuccessful. It recruited well in cooperative bakeries, but struggled elsewhere, until the Second World War. In 1935 it barred master bakers from holding office in the union.

The union became more centralised in the 1950s. In 1964 it shortened its name to become the Bakers&#x27; Union. This was later lengthened to the present name.

In July 2015 the BFAWU endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

In 2017 members of the BFAWU staged the first strikes at McDonald&#x27;s in the UK.

During the Labour Party leadership election in 2020 the union backed Rebecca Long-Bailey. It also backed Richard Burgon for deputy leader.

In November 2020 the union announced that it planned to consult its members on whether to remain affiliated to the Labour Party following the suspension of former party leader Jeremy Corbyn. In September 2021 it announced during Labour&#x27;s annual conference that it would disaffiliate from the party, citing dissatisfaction with Keir Starmer&#x27;s leadership.

==Election results==
The union sponsored Labour Party candidates in several Parliamentary elections, winning twice.

<doc id="451998" wikidata="Q598836" url="?curid=451998" title="Elder Thing">
<text>The Elder Things (also known as the Old Ones and Elder Ones) are fictional extraterrestrials in the Cthulhu Mythos. The beings first appeared in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novella, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; (published in 1936, but written in 1931), and later appeared, although not named, in the short story &quot;The Dreams in the Witch-House&quot; (1933). Additional references to the Elder Things appear in Lovecraft&#x27;s short story &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; (1936).

== Description ==
In the Mythos canon, the Elder Things are the first extraterrestrial species to come to the Earth, colonizing the planet about one billion years ago. They stand roughly eight feet tall and have the appearance of a huge, oval-shaped barrel with starfish-like appendages at both ends. The top appendage is a head adorned with five eyes, five eating tubes, and a set of cilia for &quot;seeing&quot; without light. The bottom appendage was five-limbed and was used for walking and other forms of locomotion. The beings also had five leathery, fan-like retractable wings and five sets of branching tentacles that sprouted from their torsos. Both their tentacles and the slits housing their folded wings were spaced at regular intervals about their bodies.

Lovecraft described the Elder Things as vegetable-like or echinoderm-like in shape, having radial symmetry instead of the bilateral symmetry of bipeds. They also differ in that they have a five-lobed brain. The Elder Things exhibit vegetable and animal characteristics and reproduce via spores. Academic John L. Steadman describes the ambiguity over their classification as contributing to their creepiness. They are amphibious, and carnivorous by preference.

The entities are described in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;: 
Six feet end to end, three and five-tenths feet central diameter, tapering to one foot at each end. Like a barrel with five bulging ridges in place of staves. Lateral breakages, as of thinnish stalks, are at equator in middle of these ridges. In furrows between ridges are curious growths—combs or wings that fold up and spread out like fans ... which gives almost seven-foot wing spread. Arrangement reminds one of certain monsters of primal myth, especially fabled Elder Things in the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.

The Elder Things can withstand the pressures of the deepest ocean, interstellar travel, and can hibernate for vast epochs of time. Few die except by accident or violence. Nonetheless, unlike many of Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional creations, the Elder Things are described as made of normal, terrestrial matter:

The Cthulhu-spawn and the Mi-Go seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the Old Ones ... The Old Ones, but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital properties, were strictly material, and must have their absolute origin within the known space-time continuum. Their society is alien, and their motivations are unfathomable to humans. However, a human scientist in &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; recognizes them as fellow scientists, not monsters. Their science was extremely advanced, and they are depicted as having potentially created life on Earth. Their primary achievement is the creation of a servitor race, the shoggoths, upon which they become increasingly dependent. Although they initially colonized the entirety of Earth, successive wars over millions of years with the Great Race of Yith, the Star-spawn of Cthulhu, the Mi-go, and a rebellion of the Shoggoths weakened them. Radical climate change eventually forced them to abandon most of their great cities. The final fate of the Elder Things is explicitly unclear, and the human scientists in the story openly speculate that hidden undersea cities may still survive in some places.

In &quot;The Dreams in the Witch-House&quot;, the central character is sent through a dimensional portal to a planet in a triple star system located &quot;between Hydra and Argo Navis&quot;, which is populated by Elder Things.

<doc id="451999" wikidata="Q2000614" url="?curid=451999" title="Linking number">
<text>In mathematics, the linking number is a numerical invariant that describes the linking of two closed curves in three-dimensional space. Intuitively, the linking number represents the number of times that each curve winds around the other. In Euclidean space, the linking number is always an integer, but may be positive or negative depending on the orientation of the two curves (this is not true for curves in most 3-manifolds, where linking numbers can also be fractions or just not exist at all).

The linking number was introduced by Gauss in the form of the linking integral. It is an important object of study in knot theory, algebraic topology, and differential geometry, and has numerous applications in mathematics and science, including quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, and the study of DNA supercoiling.

==Definition==
Any two closed curves in space, if allowed to pass through themselves but not each other, can be moved into exactly one of the following standard positions. This determines the linking number:

&lt;/math&gt;

The path integral for arbitrary formula_1 is now easily done by substituting this into the Chern–Simons action to get an effective action for the formula_1 field. To get the path integral for the Wilson loops, we substitute for a source describing two particles moving in closed loops, i.e. formula_3, with 

: formula_4 

Since the effective action is quadratic in formula_1, it is clear that there will be terms describing the self-interaction of the particles, and these are uninteresting since they would be there even in the presence of just one loop. Therefore, we normalize the path integral by a factor precisely cancelling these terms. Going through the algebra, we obtain 

: formula_6

where 

: formula_7

which is simply Gauss&#x27;s linking integral. This is the simplest example of a topological quantum field theory, where the path integral computes topological invariants. This also served as a hint that the nonabelian variant of Chern–Simons theory computes other knot invariants, and it was shown explicitly by Edward Witten that the nonabelian theory gives the invariant known as the Jones polynomial. 

The Chern-Simons gauge theory lives in 3 spacetime dimensions. More generally, there exists higher dimensional topological quantum field theories. There exists more complicated multi-loop/string-braiding statistics of 4-dimensional gauge theories captured by the link invariants of exotic topological quantum field theories in 4 spacetime dimensions. 

==Generalizations==

* Just as closed curves can be linked in three dimensions, any two closed manifolds of dimensions &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; may be linked in a Euclidean space of dimension formula_8. Any such link has an associated Gauss map, whose degree is a generalization of the linking number.
* Any framed knot has a self-linking number obtained by computing the linking number of the knot &quot;C&quot; with a new curve obtained by slightly moving the points of &quot;C&quot; along the framing vectors. The self-linking number obtained by moving vertically (along the blackboard framing) is known as Kauffman&#x27;s self-linking number.
* The linking number is defined for two linked circles; given three or more circles, one can define the Milnor invariants, which are a numerical invariant generalizing linking number.
* In algebraic topology, the cup product is a far-reaching algebraic generalization of the linking number, with the Massey products being the algebraic analogs for the Milnor invariants.
* A linkless embedding of an undirected graph is an embedding into three-dimensional space such that every two cycles have zero linking number. The graphs that have a linkless embedding have a forbidden minor characterization as the graphs with no Petersen family minor.

<text>The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) is the oldest teachers&#x27; trade union in the world, having been founded in 1847 when dominies became concerned about the effect of changes to the system of education in Scotland on their professional status. The EIS is the largest teaching union in Scotland, representing 80% of the country&#x27;s teachers and lecturers. it has 56,342 members.

The &quot;Scottish Educational Journal&quot; (SEJ) is the magazine of the EIS, which has been appearing, formerly in tabloid format, since ca. 1917.

==Fellowships==

Since being granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria, it is the only union able to award degrees. A recipient of the EIS degree is a &quot;Fellow of the Educational Institute of Scotland&quot;, denoted by the post-nominal &quot;FEIS&quot;.

An early example of such a degree (awarded in December 1847) was worded as follows:
== Industrial action ==
Threats of industrial action by the EIS evoke memories for many of the long-running teacher strikes of the 1980s During the 1984-86 industrial action almost 15 million pupil days were lost across Scotland. It was a sustained campaign of industrial action in Scottish education in opposition to the Conservative Government. Larry Flanagan has described it as “&quot;the first time that any group of workers, anywhere in the UK, successfully stood firm in defiance of a concerted, ideologically driven attack by the Tory government&quot;.”

<doc id="452014" wikidata="Q865849" url="?curid=452014" title="Birr, County Offaly">
<text>Birr (; , meaning &quot;plain of water&quot;) is a town in County Offaly, Ireland. Between 1620 and 1899 it was called Parsonstown, after the Parsons family who were local landowners and hereditary Earls of Rosse. The town is in a civil parish of the same name.

Birr is a designated Irish &quot;Heritage Town&quot; with a carefully preserved Georgian heritage. Birr itself has graceful wide streets and elegant buildings. Many of the houses in John&#x27;s Place and Oxmantown Mall have exquisite fanlight windows of the Georgian period.

The town is known for Birr Castle and Gardens: the home of the Parsons family and the site of the Leviathan of Parsonstown, which was the largest telescope in the world for over 70 years.

==Access and transport==
The town is situated near the meeting of the Camcor and Little Brosna rivers, the latter flowing on into the River Shannon near Victoria Lock.

The Ormond Flying Club has been in operation at Birr Airfield for over 30 years.

Birr lies on the N52 and N62 national secondary roads. The routes are combined as they pass through Birr. The R439, R440 and R489 regional roads also terminate in the town.

Bus Éireann provide public transport services to the town. The Athlone to Limerick service regularly passes through the town daily. Kearns privately owned bus service provides a number of direct bus services to Dublin from Birr, as well as a weekend service connecting the town with the city of Galway via Portumna, Killimor, and, Loughrea.

Birr railway station, the terminus of a branch from the Limerick–Ballybrophy line at Roscrea, opened on 8 March 1858 and closed on 1 January 1963.

==History==
===Ancient history===
A monastery was founded here by St Brendan of Birr. It produced the MacRegol Gospels, named after the abbot at the turn of the 8th/9th century and now to be seen in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. The Synod of Birr, held in 697, was the occasion on which the Cáin Adomnáin, or law of innocents, was pronounced.

In Gaelic Ireland, Birr was located in the O&#x27;Carroll territory of Éile. This petty kingdom () formed an area that now forms the south of County Offaly and the northeast of County Tipperary. The Tuatha was subject to the overkingdom () of Munster and formed a border with the Kingdom of Meath to the east. The boundary between Ely O&#x27;Carroll and the ancient Meath is co-terminous with the present boundary between the Diocese of Killaloe and the Diocese of Meath. The O&#x27;Carroll family had a castle located at the present site of Birr Castle. Following the Plantations of Ireland, Birr was located in the Barony of Ballybritt following the formation of King&#x27;s County (now County Offaly) in 1556.

The town itself is an old market and former garrison town dating to the 1620s.

===Crotty Schism===
The town was also the location of the Crotty Schism, one of the few schisms to affect the Catholic Church in Ireland in the 19th century. The church on Castle Street were the result of the Crotty Schism and were allowed to fall into a derelict condition after disuse following the end of the schism. The church is known locally as Crotty&#x27;s Church. In the early 2020s it was restored externally and converted into a private residence contrary to the wishes of the Town&#x27;s residents. This is all the more puzzling when the Birr Georgian Society were refused the opportunity to restore the building into a Museum following minor interior damage during preliminary works some years ago.

===Birr Barracks===
Birr Barracks became the depot of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment (Royal Canadians) from 1881. The barracks at Birr was burned down in 1922 during the Irish Civil War and the outer perimeter wall is all that remains. Outside the old Barracks Wall, there is a monument erected in memory of the soldiers of the Leinster Regiment who were killed during their service. A wreath-laying ceremony takes place annually. Much of the Barracks&#x27; historical footprint is now occupied by the Grant Engineering factory.

==Features==

=== Georgian Birr ===

Birr is a designated Irish Heritage Town due to the preservation and wealth of Georgian architecture in the town. The earliest Georgian-style buildings dating from the 1740s are located in Emmet Square and Emmet Street (then known as Cumberland Square and Cumberland Street).

The column in the centre of the square dates from 1747 and was built to carry the statue of the Duke of Cumberland, known as the Bloody Duke and the victor of the Battle of Culloden. The statue was removed in 1915 as it was in danger of collapse.

The Oxmantown Mall was laid out in the early 19th century and was designed as a promenade leading from Birr Castle gates to the Church of Ireland. The mall is tree lined on one side with the Georgian houses on the other.

John&#x27;s Mall was also built during this time also with fine Georgian buildings. The area is also known as the chains due to the sturdy chain railings enclosing the central plots in the centre of the Mall. Birr Town Council met here in a building known as John&#x27;s Hall built in the style of a Greek Temple.
The Seffin Stone is said to mark the centre of Ireland. Mentioned by Geraldus Cambrensis, who referred to it as &quot;Umbilicus Hiberniae&quot;, the indentations on the stone are as old as megalithic sites, such as Newgrange. Myths claim that the indentations are from the hand of Fionn MacCuthaill, hence the origin of the name as &quot;Suigh Finn&quot; (pronounced &quot;See-Finn&quot;), the Seat of Fionn. It is located to the left of the gates to John&#x27;s Hall, on John&#x27;s Mall, close to Emmet Square. The Stone is accompanied by a decommissioned cannon, The Crimean Gun, which was presented to the Parsons family and the people of Birr following its capture during the Siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War. The Cannon was originally displayed inside the Castle Demesne before being placed outside John&#x27;s Hall.

In Emmet Square stands &quot;Dooly&#x27;s Hotel&quot;: one of the oldest coaching inns in Ireland, dating from 1747. The name of Galway Blazers was given to the Galway Hunt after a celebration held in the hotel in 1809 resulted in the premises being set on fire. Film director John Huston was latterly a member of the Galway Blazers. Australian soprano Dame Nellie Melba famously sang to crowds gathered below in the Square, from her hotel room above in Dooly&#x27;s Hotel. The nightclub attached to the hotel is named &quot;Melba&#x27;s&quot; to mark the occasion.

===Ecclesiastical architecture===
On the Wilmer road, near the County Arms Hotel, is a Gothic-style Catholic church built. St. Brendan&#x27;s Church of Ireland was also built in Gothic style in 1815 and is located in the Oxmantown Mall. A smaller Methodist Church known as Wesley Chapel was built in 1820 on Emmett Street to accommodate a growing Methodist congregation following the preaching of John Wesley in the late 18th century in Birr.

The Sisters of Mercy convent on Wilmer Road beside the Catholic church is also a gothic-styled building. Most of the convent was converted by Offaly County Council to civic offices and a public library.

===Birr Castle===

In the 16th century, the O&#x27;Carrolls of Éile had one of their castles here and this was granted to the English-born politician and judge Sir Lawrence Parsons in the course of the Stuart plantation, c. 1620. Sir Laurence Parsons built most of the structure of the present castle on the site of the original castle&#x27;s Gatehouse. The castle was twice besieged in the 17th century and one of the towers still shows the scars of the artillery of Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan, who tried unsuccessfully to take it. The castle remains the seat of the Earls of Rosse and is home to the current peer, Brendan Parsons, 7th Earl of Rosse, with family members resident in the demesne. As a family home, most of the castle is only open to the public on special occasions, though five reception rooms can be visited, by guided tour only, through the demesne&#x27;s visitor centre. The castle&#x27;s demesne, however, is open to tourists every day of the year, and the gardens comprise a landscaped park with waterfalls, rivers and a lake, as well as the large reflecting telescope, the Leviathan of Parsonstown, and the modern radio-telescope, I-LOFAR. Below the South face of the Castle proper, St. Brendan&#x27;s Well can be found. It is a set of steps descending below ground level covered by a small gated grotto. The bottom step is submerged in well water.

====Birr Telescope – The &#x27;Leviathan of Parsonstown&#x27;====

The main feature on the grounds of the castle is the great Leviathan of Parsonstown, an astronomical telescope with a 72-inch metal mirror erected by The 3rd Earl of Rosse, which was, until 1917, the largest telescope in the world. The spiral structure of nebulae was discovered through this telescope. It featured in the PBS (USA) documentary, &#x27;Telescope – Hunting the Edge of Space Part 1: The Mystery of the Milky Way&#x27; (2011). Astronomy broadcaster Sir Patrick Moore wrote &quot;The Astronomy of Birr Castle (1971)&quot;, a history of the telescope and the significance of the work carried out here.

===Workhouse===
The workhouse, located in Syngefield, on Newbridge Street, opened in 1842 before the Great Famine. The building is now mainly derelict. It is not yet open to the public.

===Firsts ===
On 31 August 1869, the first road fatality recorded in history occurred in Birr, when local-born scientist Mary Ward, a cousin of The 3rd Earl of Rosse, fell from a steam-powered car on a bend. The vehicle traversed her, causing fatal injuries.

A descendant of the O&#x27;Carrolls, Charles Carroll was the first and only Catholic to sign the United States Declaration of Independence and, also, the only signatory to give his address. To distinguish himself from his father, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, he signed in full as &quot;Charles Carroll of Carrollton&quot;.

==Local government==
In local government, Birr is a municipal district within Offaly County Council. The district itself covers the entire west and south of Offaly. The district returns 6 elected representatives to Offaly County Hall in Tullamore. The area was administered by Birr Urban District Council until 2002, and subsequently by Birr Town Council until 2014, when the council was dissolved and administration of the town was amalgamated with Offaly County Council in accordance with the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

===Birr Court House===
Birr Court House, built c1830, is a detached five-bay two-storey castellated courthouse located on Townsend St, Birr. Over the years the building has served as a prison, court and county council offices. The courthouse has since closed down and now lies empty.
The Courthouse was used to host Creative Arts events during Vintage Week 2023 and is hoped to be developed as part of the Creative Court project into a more permanent arts venue.

==Services and amenities==
The town is served by three primary schools (St Brendan&#x27;s Boys school, Mercy Primary School and the Model Primary School) and one secondary school (St. Brendan&#x27;s Community School).

==Sport==

===Hurling===

Birr&#x27;s hurling team, Birr GAA, has won the All-Ireland championship four times. Several of Birr&#x27;s hurlers, including Brian Whelahan, attended St. Brendan&#x27;s Community School.

The first ever All-Ireland hurling final was played in Hoare&#x27;s field (currently the location of a Tesco store) in Birr on Easter Sunday, 1 April 1888, between Tipperary and Galway. The match was won by Tipperary on a score line of 1 goal, 1 point and 1 forfeit point to Galway&#x27;s no score. A forfeit point was given against a player carrying the sliotar over his own goal line. The remarkably low score, albeit under different rules to the modern game, is recorded as the lowest score ever in a hurling match in the Guinness Book of Records.

===Rugby===

Founded in 1887, Birr RFC has lapsed on several occasions, particularly during the two world wars and again in the mid-1950s. It was reformed in 1963 and has been in continuous existence since.

===Golf===
Birr Golf Club is an 18-hole golf course which was founded in 1893. The course was founded originally at Barrone Court, moving to its present location at the Glenns, north of Birr, in 1909.

==Events and festivals==

The annual Birr Vintage Week and Arts Festival takes place in the town in August. The festival is run over one week, and includes a vintage parade, markets, and music and theatre events. Birr is also home to Birr Festival of Music, OFFline Film Festival, Scripts Ireland&#x27;s Playwriting Festival and Hullabaloo! Offaly&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Arts Festival.

Birr Theatre and Arts Centre, located in the Oxmantown Mall, is a local cultural and social amenity for the arts, dance, film, music and theatre. The theatre has a 220 seating capacity. The building dates from January 1889 and is a Victorian period style structure within the surrounds of the tree lined Oxmantown Mall. Birr Stage Guild also stage plays in the theatre.

<text>Boogie Nights is a 1997 American drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Paul Thomas Anderson. It is set in Los Angeles&#x27;s San Fernando Valley and focuses on a young nightclub dishwasher who becomes a popular star of pornographic films, chronicling his rise in the Golden Age of Porn of the 1970s through his fall during the excesses of the 1980s. The film is an expansion of Anderson&#x27;s mockumentary short film &quot;The Dirk Diggler Story&quot; (1988), and stars Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Heather Graham.

&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 1997, and was theatrically released by New Line Cinema on October 10, 1997, garnering critical acclaim. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Original Screenplay for Anderson, Best Supporting Actress for Moore, and Best Supporting Actor for Reynolds. The film&#x27;s soundtrack also received acclaim. It has since been considered one of Anderson&#x27;s best works and one of the best films of all time.

==Plot==
In 1977, high-school dropout Eddie Adams is living with his father and emotionally and physically abusive mother in Torrance, California. He works at a Reseda nightclub owned by Maurice Rodriguez, where he meets porn filmmaker Jack Horner. Interested in bringing Eddie into porn, Jack auditions the latter by watching him have sex with Rollergirl, a porn starlet who always wears roller skates.

After a fight with his mother, Eddie moves in with Jack at his San Fernando Valley home. He gives himself the screen name &quot;Dirk Diggler&quot; and becomes a star because of his good looks, youthful charisma, and abnormally large penis. His success allows him to buy a new house, an extensive wardrobe, and a &quot;competition orange&quot; 1977 Chevrolet Corvette. With his friend and co-star Reed Rothchild, Dirk pitches a series of successful action-themed porn films. He works and socializes with others from the porn industry, and they live carefree lifestyles in the late 1970s disco era. While attending a New Year&#x27;s Eve party at Horner&#x27;s house on December 31, 1979, assistant director Little Bill Thompson discovers his adulterous wife having sex with another man. Bill, tired of being repeatedly cheated on, shoots the pair dead and commits suicide.

Dirk and Reed begin using cocaine on a regular basis. Due to his drug use, Dirk finds it increasingly difficult to achieve an erection, falls into violent mood swings, and becomes irritated with Johnny Doe, a rival leading man Jack has recently recruited, and whom Dirk worries will replace him. In 1983, after arguing with Jack, Dirk is fired and takes off with Reed to start a music career along with Scotty, a boom operator who is in love with Dirk. Jack rejects business overtures from Floyd Gondolli, a local theater magnate who insists on cutting costs by shooting on videotape rather than film stock, because Jack believes that video will diminish the quality of his films.

After his friend and financier, Colonel James, is incarcerated for possession of child pornography, Jack cooperates with Gondolli but becomes disillusioned with the work he is expected to churn out. One of these projects involves Jack and Rollergirl riding in a limousine, searching for random men for her to have sex with while being taped by a crew. One man recognizes Rollergirl as a former high-school classmate, and after a failed attempt at intercourse, he insults her and Jack. Both Jack and Rollergirl attack the man, leaving him bloodied on the sidewalk.

Leading lady Amber Waves lands in a custody battle with her ex-husband. The court determines that she is an unfit mother due to her involvement in the porn industry, criminal record, and cocaine addiction. Buck Swope marries fellow porn star Jessie St. Vincent, who becomes pregnant. Because of his past as a pornographer, Buck is disqualified from a bank loan and cannot open his own stereo equipment store. That night, he finds himself in the middle of a holdup at a donut shop in which the clerk, the robber, and an armed customer are killed. Buck is the sole survivor and escapes with the money.

Having spent most of their money on drugs, Dirk and Reed are unable to pay a recording studio for demo tapes they believe will enable them to become music stars. Desperate for money, Dirk resorts to prostitution but is assaulted and robbed by three men. Dirk, Reed, and their friend Todd Parker attempt to scam local drug dealer Rahad Jackson at his estate by selling him a half-kilo of baking soda disguised as cocaine. Dirk and Reed intend to leave quickly before Rahad&#x27;s bodyguard inspects it, but a drugged-up and armed Todd attempts to steal more money, as well as some more drugs, from Rahad. In the ensuing gunfight, Todd kills Rahad&#x27;s bodyguard and is killed by Rahad, while Dirk and Reed narrowly escape. Dirk returns to Jack&#x27;s home and they reconcile.

In 1984, Amber shoots the television commercial for the opening of Buck&#x27;s store, Rollergirl takes a GED class, Maurice opens a nightclub with his brothers, Reed performs magic acts at a strip club, and Jessie gives birth to her and Buck&#x27;s son. Dirk, Jack, and Amber prepare to start filming again.

===Development===
&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is based on a mockumentary short film that Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed while he was still in high school called &quot;The Dirk Diggler Story&quot;. The short itself was based on the 1981 documentary &quot;Exhausted: John C. Holmes, The Real Story&quot;, a documentary about the life of legendary porn actor John Holmes, on whom Dirk Diggler is based.
Anderson originally wanted the role of Eddie to be played by Leonardo DiCaprio, after seeing him in &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;. DiCaprio enjoyed the screenplay, but had to turn it down because he had signed on to star in James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Titanic&quot;. He recommended his &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; co-star Mark Wahlberg for the role. DiCaprio would later say that he wished he had done both. Joaquin Phoenix was also offered the role of Eddie, but he declined it due to concerns about playing a porn star. Phoenix later collaborated with Anderson on the films &quot;The Master&quot; and &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;. Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Warren Beatty, Albert Brooks and Sydney Pollack declined or were passed up on the role of Jack Horner, which went to Burt Reynolds. After starring in &quot;Hard Eight&quot;, Samuel L. Jackson declined the role of Buck Swope, which went to Don Cheadle. Anderson initially did not consider Heather Graham for Rollergirl, because he had never seen her do nudity in a film. However, Graham&#x27;s agent called Anderson asking if she could read for the part, which she won. Gwyneth Paltrow, Drew Barrymore and Tatum O&#x27;Neal were also up for the role.

After having a very difficult time getting his previous film, &quot;Hard Eight&quot;, released, Anderson laid down a hard law when making &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;. He initially wanted the film to be over three hours long and be rated NC-17. The film&#x27;s producers, particularly Michael De Luca, said that the film had to be either under three hours or rated R. Anderson fought with them, saying that the film would not have a mainstream appeal no matter what. They did not change their minds, and Anderson chose the R rating as a challenge. Despite this, the film was still 25 minutes shorter than promised.

Reynolds did not get along with Anderson while filming. After seeing a rough cut of the film, Reynolds allegedly fired his agent for recommending it. Despite this, Reynolds won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Later, Anderson wanted Reynolds to star in his next film &quot;Magnolia&quot;, but Reynolds declined it. In 2012, Reynolds denied rumors that he disliked the film, calling it &quot;extraordinary&quot; and saying that his opinion of it has nothing to do with his relationship with Anderson. According to Wahlberg, Reynolds wanted his character Jack Horner to have an Irish accent, which he used for the character on his first day of shooting, before dropping it on the next day.

According to Thomas Jane, who played Todd Parker in the film, the character Cosmo throwing firecrackers throughout the drug deal scene was not originally in the script, but was written for Anderson&#x27;s friend Joe G. M. Chan, whom Anderson had seen randomly throwing firecrackers at a party before asking him to appear in the film. Jane also said that Reynolds had attempted to knee him in the crotch during filming due to Anderson keeping the camera rolling after the end of the take, with Jane taunting him as part of a prank. Reynolds sent a six pack of beer to Jane&#x27;s trailer as an apology.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and New York Film Festival, before opening on two screens in the United States on October 10, 1997. It grossed $50,168 during its opening weekend. Three weeks later, it expanded to 907 theaters and grossed $4.7 million, ranking number four for the week. It eventually earned $26.4 million in the United States and $16.7 million in foreign markets for a worldwide box office total of $43.1 million.

==Reception==


On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; holds an approval rating of 94% based on 77 reviews, with an average score of 8.10/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Grounded in strong characters, bold themes, and subtle storytelling, &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is a groundbreaking film both for director P.T. Anderson and star Mark Wahlberg.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 86 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Everything about &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is interestingly unexpected,&quot; although &quot;the film&#x27;s extravagant 2-hour 32-minute length amounts to a slight tactical mistake ... [it] has no trouble holding interest ... but the length promises larger ideas than the film finally delivers.&quot; She praised Burt Reynolds for &quot;his best and most suavely funny performance in many years,&quot; and added, &quot;The movie&#x27;s special gift happens to be Mark Wahlberg, who gives a terrifically appealing performance.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; observed: 

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated, &quot;&quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is the first great film about the 1970s to come out since the &#x27;70s ... It gets all the details right, nailing down the styles and the music. More impressive, it captures the decade&#x27;s distinct, decadent glamour ... [It] also succeeds at something very difficult: re-creating the ethos and mentality of an era ... Paul Thomas Anderson ... has pulled off a wonderful, sprawling, sophisticated film ... With &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, we know we&#x27;re not just watching episodes from disparate lives but a panorama of recent social history, rendered in bold, exuberant colors.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a startling film, but not for the obvious reasons. Yes, its decision to focus on the pornography business in the San Fernando Valley in the 1970s and 1980s is nerviness itself, but more impressive is the film&#x27;s sureness of touch, its ability to be empathetic, nonjudgmental and gently satirical, to understand what is going on beneath the surface of this raunchy &quot;Nashville&quot;-esque universe and to deftly relate it to our own ... Perhaps the most exciting thing about &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is the ease with which writer-director Anderson ... spins out this complex web. A true storyteller, able to easily mix and match moods in a playful and audacious manner, he is a filmmaker definitely worth watching, both now and in the future.&quot; In Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston concluded, &quot;The porn milieu may scare some folks off, but &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; offers laughs, tenderness, terror and redemption--everything you could ask for in a movie. It&#x27;s an impressive and satisfying film, one the Academy really ought to have the balls to recognize.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;[T]his chunk of movie dynamite is detonated by Mark Wahlberg ... who grabs a breakout role and runs with it ... Even when &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; flies off course as it tracks its bizarrely idealistic characters into the &#x27;80s ... you can sense the passionate commitment at the core of this hilarious and harrowing spectacle. For this, credit Paul Thomas Anderson ... who ... scores a personal triumph by finding glints of rude life in the ashes that remained after Watergate. For all the unbridled sex, what is significant, timely and, finally, hopeful about &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; is the way Anderson proves that a movie can be mercilessly honest and mercifully humane at the same time.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it &quot;beautifully made&quot; and praised the performances, calling Reynolds &quot;absolutely centered and in control of his emotions&quot; and saying Wahlberg &quot;couldn&#x27;t be better&quot;. However, he moderated his praise by saying, &quot;The early rave reviews accorded this film suggest a significance that I, however, did not encounter. Show-biz stories are all pretty much the same: ambition, stardom, drugs, disillusionment. Add the home video revolution to this mix and curiosity about the size of the boy wonder&#x27;s equipment; throw in a few topical references like the soft drink Fresca, and you have the bare bones of the story.&quot; He gave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four.

Despite the accolades Wahlberg received for his performance in &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, he would later express regret for having made the film. &quot;I&#x27;ve made some poor choices in the past&quot;, he said, and stated he wanted God to forgive him for appearing in it. Wahlberg later clarified his comments, saying he had made them because he &quot;was sitting in front of a couple of thousand kids talking about and trying to encourage them to come back to their faith, and I was just saying that I just hope [God] has a sense of humor because I maybe made some decisions that may not be okay with Him.&quot; He also stated in an interview with Andy Cohen that his comment was &quot;a joke taken too seriously&quot;.

<doc id="452018" wikidata="Q1431648" url="?curid=452018" title="Data definition language">
<text>In the context of SQL, data definition or data description language (DDL) is a syntax for creating and modifying database objects such as tables, indices, and users. DDL statements are similar to a computer programming language for defining data structures, especially database schemas. Common examples of DDL statements include codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3. If you see a .ddl file, that means the file contains a statement to create a table. Oracle SQL Developer contains the ability to export from an ERD generated with Data Modeler to either a .sql file or a .ddl file.

==History==
The concept of the data definition language and its name was first introduced in relation to the Codasyl database model, where the schema of the database was written in a language syntax describing the records, fields, and sets of the user data model. Later it was used to refer to a subset of Structured Query Language (SQL) for declaring tables, columns, data types and constraints. SQL-92 introduced a schema manipulation language and schema information tables to query schemas. These information tables were specified as SQL/Schemata in . The term DDL is also used in a generic sense to refer to any formal language for describing data or information structures.

==Structured Query Language (SQL)==
Many data description languages use a declarative syntax to define columns and data types. Structured Query Language (SQL), however, uses a collection of imperative verbs whose effect is to modify the schema of the database by adding, changing, or deleting definitions of tables or other elements. These statements can be freely mixed with other SQL statements, making the DDL not a separate language.

===CREATE statement===
The &quot;create&quot; command is used to establish a new database, table, index, or stored procedure.

The &quot;CREATE&quot; statement in SQL creates a component in a relational database management system (RDBMS). In the SQL 1992 specification, the types of components that can be created are schemas, tables, views, domains, character sets, collations, translations, and assertions. Many implementations extend the syntax to allow creation of additional elements, such as indexes and user profiles. Some systems, such as PostgreSQL and SQL Server, allow &quot;CREATE&quot;, and other DDL commands, inside a database transaction and thus they may be rolled back.

====CREATE TABLE statement====
A commonly used &quot;CREATE&quot; command is the &quot;CREATE TABLE&quot; command. The typical usage is:

 CREATE TABLE &quot;[table name]&quot; ( &quot;[column definitions]&quot; ) &quot;[table parameters]&quot;

The column definitions are:
*A comma-separated list consisting of any of the following
*Column definition: &quot;[column name]&quot; &quot;[data type]&quot; &quot;{NULL | NOT NULL}&quot; &quot;{column options}&quot;
*Primary key definition: &quot;PRIMARY KEY&quot; ( &quot;[comma separated column list]&quot; )
*Constraints: &quot;{CONSTRAINT}&quot; &quot;[constraint definition]&quot;
*RDBMS specific functionality

An example statement to create a table named &quot;employees&quot; with a few columns is:

CREATE TABLE employees (
 id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
 first_name VARCHAR(50) not null,
 last_name VARCHAR(75) not null,
 mid_name VARCHAR(50) not null,
 dateofbirth DATE not null


Some forms of &quot;CREATE TABLE DDL&quot; may incorporate DML (data manipulation language)-like constructs, such as the &quot;CREATE TABLE AS SELECT&quot; (CTaS) syntax of SQL.

===DROP statement===
The &quot;DROP&quot; statement destroys an existing database, table, index, or view.

A &quot;DROP&quot; statement in SQL removes a component from a relational database management system (RDBMS). The types of objects that can be dropped depends on which RDBMS is being used, but most support the dropping of tables, users, and databases. Some systems (such as PostgreSQL) allow DROP and other DDL commands to occur inside of a transaction and thus be rolled back. The typical usage is simply:

 DROP &quot;objecttype&quot; &quot;objectname&quot;.

For example, the command to drop a table named employees is:
DROP TABLE employees;
The &quot;DROP&quot; statement is distinct from the &quot;DELETE&quot; and &quot;TRUNCATE&quot; statements, in that &quot;DELETE&quot; and &quot;TRUNCATE&quot; do not remove the table itself. For example, a &quot;DELETE&quot; statement might delete some (or all) data from a table while leaving the table itself in the database, whereas a &quot;DROP&quot; statement removes the entire table from the database.

===ALTER statement===
The &quot;ALTER&quot; statement modifies an existing database object.

An &quot;ALTER&quot; statement in SQL changes the properties of an object inside of a relational database management system (RDBMS). The types of objects that can be altered depends on which RDBMS is being used. The typical usage is:

 ALTER &quot;objecttype&quot; &quot;objectname&quot; &quot;parameters&quot;.

For example, the command to add (then remove) a column named bubbles for an existing table named sink is:
ALTER TABLE sink ADD bubbles INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE sink DROP COLUMN bubbles;
===TRUNCATE statement===
The &quot;TRUNCATE&quot; statement is used to delete all data from a table. It&#x27;s much faster than &quot;DELETE&quot;.
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
===Referential integrity statements===
Another type of DDL sentence in SQL is used to define referential integrity relationships, usually implemented as primary key and foreign key tags in some columns of the tables. These two statements can be included in a &quot;CREATE TABLE&quot; or an &quot;ALTER TABLE&quot; sentence;

==Other languages==
* XML Schema is an example of a DDL for XML.
* JSON Schema is an example of a DDL for JSON.
* DFDL schema is an example of a DDL that can describe many text and binary formats.

<text>The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) is a trade union in the United Kingdom for wholetime firefighters (including officers up to chief fire officer / firemaster), retained firefighters and emergency control room staff.

==History==
=== Early 20th century ===
The first recorded instance of trade union organisation of firefighters was when the Municipal Employees&#x27; Association recruited several London County Council firemen in early 1905, which by the end of the following year had grown to a branch of 500.

After the entire branch had transferred to the rival National Union of Corporation Workers (NUCW), the branch grew to 1,100 of the 1,300 London firemen and to protect the then branch secretary from potential dismissal, sub-officer E. W. Southgate handed over branch secretaryship to Jim Bradley, a London park-keeper who had been nominated by the union&#x27;s executive.

Following the strike of police officers on 29 August 1918, Bradley organised a secret ballot of firemen on the issue of strike action over pay and conditions. After winning the right to a representative board for London firemen, the fire brigade branch of NUCW seceded from the union to join the Firemen&#x27;s Trade Union, what had been a friendly society for around 200 firemen in private brigades led by George Gamble, with Bradley becoming assistant secretary.

In 1930, the union changed its name to the Fire Brigades Union.

===Second World War===
The Air Raid Precautions Act (1937) contained provisions for recruiting a volunteer force of auxiliaries to supplement existing fire brigades, which were called up on 1 September 1939. The 95,000 called up (89,000 men, 6,000 women) formed the Auxiliary Fire Service (AFS) far outnumbered the around 6,000 full-time regulars. AFS firefighters were on worse conditions, with regular firemen promoted to be their officers. The war emergency also saw the re-instatement of continuous duty service, which was dropped after a week in favour of a 112-hour week.

The question of the AFS transformed the union, the incumbent leadership, headed by General Secretary Percy Kingdom, held that the AFS were dilutees and therefore should be marginalised. This view was challenged by John Horner and other young firemen and over the course of a protracted dispute which saw all the union&#x27;s full-time officials resign, Horner was elected General Secretary. Horner then began organising auxiliaries, winning endorsement of this at the 1940 conference of the regular section of the union and saw the union&#x27;s membership increase from 3,500 in 1939 to 66,500 in 1940.

As a result of the London Blitz, the fire service was nationalised in 1941 by the powers of the Fire Services (Emergency Provisions) Bill.

=== 21st century ===
Led by its then General Secretary Andy Gilchrist, the union called a strike over pay and conditions in 2002, following an independent review of pay carried out by the same organisation that reviewed MPs&#x27; pay. The strike did not achieve its goals, and on 5 May 2005 a left wing candidate, Matt Wrack, defeated Gilchrist in the election for General Secretary, attaining 63.9% of the vote cast (12,883 votes) on a total turnout of about 40% of the membership.
In August 2013, FBU members were balloted with 78% voting in favour of industrial action, in a dispute of pensions. The first strike took place on 25 September 2013 for four hours. Periods of industrial action have continued throughout 2013 and 2014, when the dispute escalated with a 96-hour strike called from 31 October to 4 November 2014.

On 30 January 2023, FBU members voted to go on strike, with 88% in favour of strike action, on a 73% turnout. On 11 February 2023 the FBU recommended that its members accept a revised pay offer of a 7% rise backdated to July 2022 and a further 5% increase from 1 July 2023, and it postponed planned strike action for workers to vote on the offer.

In February 2024, 114 firefighters who had attended the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 were awarded a total of £20m in a lawsuit led by the FBU against the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, Arconic, Celotex, and Saint-Gobain.

In January 2025, Matt Wrack lost his bid for re-election to the union&#x27;s vice-president, Steve Wright.

== Relations with the Labour Party ==
The FBU disaffiliated from the Labour Party in 2004 due to the union&#x27;s opposition of policies put in place by the then prime minister and party leader, Tony Blair. In November 2015, the FBU re-affiliated with the Labour Party due to the union&#x27;s backing of the party&#x27;s new leader Jeremy Corbyn and his commitment to anti-austerity politics.

===Parliamentary elections===
The union sponsored Labour Party candidates in several Parliamentary elections.

== Other activities ==
=== Climate crisis ===
In 2020, the FBU co-signed a letter with Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak warning that fire services in the UK were &quot;exposed and ill-resourced to respond effectively to a climate in breakdown.&quot;
In 2023, the union released a report in which it said that the UK was &quot;woefully underprepared&quot; to handle the increased risk of wildfires caused by the climate crisis.

=== Palestine ===
The FBU has maintained a support team for firefighters in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1980s. In 2011, the Scottish branch of the union donated two fire engines to the city of Nablus in the West Bank. In 2024, the union advised its members not to comply with police requests to help crack down on protestors protesting against the Israel-Hamas War.

== Controversies ==
A report commissioned by the FBU in 2023 found that a third of female members of the union had experienced sexual harassment at union events.

<text>The &quot;Forbes&quot; 500 was an annual listing of the top 500 American companies produced by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. The list was calculated by combining five factors: sales, profits, assets, market value, and employees. The list was last issued in March 2003 (based on 2002 data for the companies); it is no longer calculated each year and has been replaced by the Forbes Global 2000, which includes non-U.S. companies but is calculated on a similar basis as the old Forbes 500 (although it does not include employees).

==Quantifying the largest companies==

Various methods exist in determining the largest corporations. Forbes Magazine, for example, takes into consideration profit, revenue, market capitalization, and value of assets when ranking companies by size; the magnitude of any one of these factors alone may not necessarily be indicative of a firm&#x27;s overall ranking.

The value of a firm&#x27;s assets is typically derived from a company&#x27;s ability to generate cash via its ownership and control of inputs and/or distribution of the final product. Banks and financial institutions, for example, tend to have a large number of assets due to loans and investments, however, a large portion of these do not actually belong to the firm since these assets are customers&#x27; deposits.

Fortune 500 ranks companies by revenue. This method is heavily biased towards distributors such as Walmart, which may have a high volume of sales but may be operating on very thin profit margins.

Another method might be to look at the market capitalization of the company. However, this price is dictated by the perceived value of the company and its prospects. At one point in the late nineties, Cisco Systems would have been the biggest company by this measure, however the dot-com bubble crash reduced its perceived value dramatically. Another example would be Amazon.com, which despite being barely profitable, has a very large market cap rivaling or exceeded established American companies due to the general market sentiment about its innovations.
